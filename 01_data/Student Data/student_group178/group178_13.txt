Thorough and friendly. Whether seeing Ms. Anderson or Ms. Tran (my last two visits), both have been great. I have deep wells and they put me on a glaucoma watch for 2 years, visiting every 6 months. Once they were comfortable that I actually just have deep wells, we're back to only annual check-ins. Great to have a team looking out for these things and being cautious when we'd first met. Now I've been visiting for more than 2 years and couldn't be happier with the experience.</text>

<text>Very modern,  very fast. I got my new glasses ordered very quickly along with a referral to a specialist. If the receptionist (I don't know what else to call her) Becky, hadn't come out to find the old guy that I am, I'd  probably still be wandering around. Thank you Becky. I very positive experience all around.</text>< Pics>

Very safe inside. Everyone masked and everything thoroughly sanitized including each pair of frames.  Dr. Andersen very knowledgeable my eye conditions.  Allison was super great helping me choose frames.  The lens recommended should be fantastic for my office work.  Overall a completely great experience.<//text>

We’ve been extremely happy with Dr. Andersen and her team. My 8 year old daughter recently got contacts and they’ve been so patient and kind in helping her adjust. We’ve had issues along the way with broken glasses and lenses too, and they’ve always rushed to fit us in and get my daughter the help she needs.< /Text>

The most thorough eye exam I've received.  Kathleen is an excellent optometrist.  I worked with her other colleague who was fantastic.  Both are highly professional, thorough using current, leading tech examination tools as well.  The sales staff also professional, courteous & thoughtful in product selection.  They clearly differentiate their practice from a commoditized Costco product, retail service operation.

Excellent practice!  Highly recommend!<//review>

I could not be happier with my experience. The whole staff is awesome! The glasses selection are just top notch. Everything was disinfected in front of me. Felt very comfortable and safe. My eye exam was the best and most accurate I have ever had and I been wearing glasses for 20 years! The equipment was  top of the line for sure Dr Chang was the sweetest and knowledgeable. I 100% recommend everyone to come here. You will leave satisfied and happy with your eye prescription and cool glasses. Thank you everyone! Stay awesome.</Review>

<text>I arrived at 9:40am for my appointment and was immediately processed for my exam to begin.

The first thing I noticed was a new and very large piece of test equipment which as the exam progressed demonstrated its “value” !

I am 75 and I mentioned a slight reduction of comfort and clear vision with my current prescription. This new test determined through “adjustments” to the current lens what the new lens should be.

The rest of the test was comfortable and I ordered new lens for my glasses and chose a second “backup” frame/lens.

I should add that my 23 year old son also has a “challenging” prescription and he also is comfortable with the level of service he receives.</text>< Pics>

The office staff was very friendly and efficient and I did not wait at all before being taken back for my tests and examination. In addition to the standard vision test, the office is equipped with additional testing equipment that the staff uses to provide information to the Doctor about other health issues with respect to my vision and or eyes.< /Text>

Another great ppointment at Doc Anderson's practice.  The entire team are true professionals.  Our family have been patients of the Doc's practice since 2006 and from day one would give her and the team the highest possible marks.<//review>

I actually stumbled into Dr. Andersen's office as I had an appointment next door. After asking a few questions of the staff I set an appointment an cancelled an appointment at a less deserving office. My first visit was equally impressive and I will definitely return for future visits. Dr. Anderson was very professional, detailed and kind. I highly recommend this service.< /Review>

<review>I love having their practice here in Rancho Santa Margarita (I live in Las Flores). This morning, I noticed a screw fell out of my prescription sunglasses and needed them repaired ASAP (I work outside and needed my sunglasses). I was so glad they opened at 8 am! They fixed my sunglasses in just a few minutes so I could proceed with my day! Great customer service!< /review>< Pics>

Dr. Anderson is so caring and has the very latest technology to help her patients.
I've had severe dry eyes for years and have been using eye drops constantly. After having an eye exam it was recommended that I try the Lipiflow treatment. After the treatment I immediately felt lubrication in my eyes. Because of having severe dry eyes the doctor recommended that I use the Nulids treatment as well. Nulids is so easy to use and it is making a drastic improvement.
I would highly recommend Dr Anderson for all your eye care needs.< /text>

By far the most advanced optometrist office I have ever been to.
I live out of town and needed new glasses and eye exam. The machines that are used here as well as the Awesome staff put me at ease and even let me know a lot about my health. They were even able to use a machine to scan the lenses I had to tell me what my previous prescription was. They also were able to tell that I did not have diabetes somehow through the exam which was a worry of mine. Really good selection of glasses and reasonable wait time. Keep up the good work 🤗< /text>

Dr Andersen is a good example of old days Medicine were the doctor on first name base and deal with the patient as friend or neighbor. I’m very impressed with her through and efficient clinical examination and the detail explainetion of every steps in every procedures. Her staff are very professional with excellent C/S courtesy.<//text>

At best Negligent - or worse Fraudulent - billing practices.

My wife and I went here as cash patients (we don't have vision coverage in our health plan) - and we paid our bill in full for our exams at the time of service.  They required our health insurance information for "their records" but said they would not use it because we were just getting routine annual exams.

we then get a bill from their office for $15 (apparently a co-pay?) where they submitted the same bills we paid for in CASH - in FULL - to our insurance company.  So either they erroneously submitted to the insurance company - or purposefully attempted to double-bill both US (cash patients) and the insurance company.

So we call them multiple times and leave messages; never get a call back.  Months go by - we still get notices for the $15 now past due - and we keep trying to call them to have them reverse the erroneous charges.  NO RESPONSE.

We then get the "red notice" saying they are sending this to collections.  We pay the $15 to simply avoid this stupid charge hitting our credit report.  Important to note - this $15 bill was FROM THIS CLINIC - and was NOT from our insurance company.  So if we were cash patients on the day - paid in full - why would they send us ANOTHER bill later on for $15 (and the bill shows they attempted to bill off against insurance etc).  This document is 100% entirely within their control (and as I confirmed with our insurance company) and this billing was not generated by our insurance company)

Needless to say - regardless of how "nice" their technology and how "high end" their practice is - when a business is non-responsive to fix such a simple issue like this - over many months - then the unethical nature of their billing (with us as their clients bearing the burden of chasing down the issues) - means I will NEVER go to this place again.   I'll also NEVER recommend anyone else go here - because if you do - their obvious efforts to double bill both cash patients and insurance companies will mean you will keep paying (with your time, or $$) for many months beyond the day you see a doctor.< /Text>

My family and I have been going to Dr. Anderson since we moved here ten years ago. We have not had any problems with the staff or the products. I would recommend Dr. Anderson to other people.< /Text>

< Review>
I went to Kathleen M. Andersen's office because i was having problems with my left. I was seen by Dr. Reyes.   During my first visit she found that I had a macular hole.  After surgery I needed get my eyes examined again because I had distsnce sight issues. I went to my Opthamologists office who miss directed me and was not able to help. I went directly back to see Dr. Reyes whi was able to see that very moment.  I love this office and all those who work there. I highly reccomend them.</Review>

< review>
After $550 and three trips in to this place, each lasting more than an hour, both my glasses came back done wrong.  I agree with the last reviewer, they try to upsell you.  Imagine that I was charged $60 for TRYING ON contacts.  How else would one know what to wear without trying them on?  I checked around and was told this was outrageous.  I have great insurance and this place had the nerve to send me another bill for $10.00 after overcharging me for everything else.  After sending a message to the "Dr" of how displeased I was and that we wouldn't be coming back, she sent me a CERTIFIED letter telling me and I quote "Good luck finding someone that will try on contacts for free,  I will no longer service your family."  Imagine the unprofessionalism of that.  Don't go here, there's a great real eye doctor in Ladera Ranch and others in Rancho that fully surpass this one without the headache and over paying for nothing.  I wouldn't go back if it was free.<//review>

<review>Just so everyone knows... not much has changed. Please don't come here and support a business that tries to steal from it's neighborhood.

This place tries to up sell you all the expensive "technology".

I've been waiting for over 2 weeks for my frames, and they didn't take all the measurements when I was there. So now i'm stuck waiting even longer for a job that my partner did a costco and got it done in less than a week.

I got attitude when asked about the alternative's to the "top of the line" technology, and when I told them i'd be back to pay because they don't take American Express I was looked at like a crazy person and got more attitude.< /review>< name>

He verified exactly what I wanted, paused throughout the haircut so I could see that it was going well, and executed my haircut without difficulty. I cannot tell you how many times I've been left with a bad haircut after going to a new barber for the first time. Chris was a refreshing new experience.

If you need a haircut I highly recommend this barbershop.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>Chris did a phenomenal job with my hair when I was a first time client. He verified exactly what I wanted, paused throughout the haircut so I could see that it was going well, and executed my haircut without difficulty. I cannot tell you how many times I've been left with a bad haircut after going to a new barber for the first time. Chris was a refreshing new experience.

If you need a haircut I highly recommend this barbershop.<//Review>< name>

< review>
Everyone in this place is in a bad mood. Specially the people that work in the deli and bakery. You ask for chicken, and you get a grumpy person, you ask the bakery a question and they give you a simple respond with an attitude. The cashiers are slow and also in a bad mood. It doesn't matter which day I come, I always get the same type of attitude. Ironically the only friendly person is the manager that's walking around. But on the bright side they sometimes have great deals which is why I shop here. I shop for the deals, not the worker interactions.</review>

I love this store! This is our family store and so many great employees there!  Always nice and clean. HOWEVER, I have to write this review because of a terribly negative unprofessional experience we had today 2/13 @2pm with Danielle the checker wearing a pink shirt. Danielle: the gentlemen who was a bagger was more courteous than you. She did not once acknowledge us , make eye contact, she basically threw the paper towels at me while I was trying my best to bag our groceries because we brought our own bags. She was more concerned with paging for help and getting us out of her line than she was her impression on her customers. Very sad to see. It’s a holiday weekend and it’s busy understandable but customer service should NEVER be absent on a customer service based job.
P.s Ralph’s we love you!! I just really hope she’s not a permanent employee there.
Stay safe everyone< /text>

<review>Nathan did a great job tonight. Wasnt able to pay for the items because I realized I didn't have my card so he set it aside so it can be scanned once my card was brought to me. The way he handled it was great. Wanted to put a review because of that.

This place is dope. They have a great deli; and selection to choose from. If you're into cheeses, there's a whole Murray's counter for you with what seems like 100 different cheeses. Staff is friendly and helpful. Only a Karen would have trouble shopping here.< /text>

I wish I can give -5 stars SAl the cashier was rude and throwing everything on the bell.  He start telling me that he was helping me also the person that was bagging the items say to me you can bag your own items.
I ask for the manager and  she was called it but never show up.
Never again I would be spending my money somewhere else.<//Text>

Excellent customer service. Kane works in the meat department and he helped me picked out some snow crabs for my crab boil. Kane personality is awesome . The store is very clean and friendly atmosphere. Also K/ne is a singer check him out on Utube. The spelling is a slash no A. I'm a satisfied customer. 👍👍👍< /Review>

Lines aren't too long, and if they do start to get too long, they immediately get other cashiers to jump on and help. I frequently visit the clearance specials in the back by the restrooms. I've come across some nice products at a good deal.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dcafb14e9f34c1:0xd505a07da43a3733<//gmapID></record>

Most people pick a grocery store because it's the most convenient or the least expensive place to shop.

I go here but not for either of those reasons. I go there because of a particular employee they have there that every time I'm there goes out of his way make sure I find everything I'm looking for and always makes sure I have the freshest and best looking meat and seafood he has available. The young man is AMAZING!

His name is Nathan and he has exemplary customer service skills and a great personality. If the company has a training or mentoring program for it's employees on customer handling skills, I suggest that he heads it up!

Thank you Nathan for the EXCELLENT customer service!</Review>

First experience of purchasing fish and having it fried after. Had cat fish and talipia with corn meal batter.  Filets were large yet when picked up when ready while waiting the clerk moved quickly yet all pieces were soggy. So next time ill ask if the pieces to be fried harder and  if  can be individually placed some other way so they dont get soggy due to ckerk closes the bag tightly. All my catfish filets tured into broken pieces. Also they do not salt the fish so maybe illbtry cajuan seasoning  next time. Yet the option to have fried is wonderful and fish was fresh. Love the options.</text>

A very nice store. A nice selection of products placed somewhere between the traditional Ralphs and Whole Foods. The staff is extremely helpful. The only downside is that at times the parking lot can be chaotic.<//review>

<Text>Clean store. Always fresh produce. Staff always helping and willing to go out of their way to make your trip easy and full filled. Parking lot is usually full and packed between 5 and 7 pm partially due to traffic from patrons making their way home after getting off of work.</Text><user_name>Moe Rezai<//user_name><userid>105293912687296925260</userid>< pics>

<text>Produce selection is very good, and priced well. Meat selection is high quality, and prices are fair. Seafood is high quality, but overpriced. Beer/spirits/wine selection is good but prices are high. I like the make your own 6 pack concept, but some customers take beer out of the actual 6 packs which leaves random 5 packs. Sushi is pretty good, sandwiches too, pre-made food is also very good quality. Very clean store too.<//text>< response>

They have hot soup. They have a lot of salad options to choose from. There is also fresh sushi here. Get your own salad which is organic for 7.99 lb.<//Review>

All I wanted to do was cook a roast beef for my husband when we got settled in our new place.  I went to 5 different stores and found all kinds and cuts of meat.  But, no roast.  Then an employee at Stater Brothers whispered to me to try Ralphs.  We went to the one on Canyon Crest Dr.  I found the most beautiful roast!  After checking out the produce dept. we are hooked on Ralphs and go there for all our groceries.  Thanks Ralphs for the great house warming meal!</Text>

Canyon Crest location has the best decorated & best tasting cakes! I have gone here for years to buy all sorts of desserts for many different types of occasions & have had soooo many compliments!  People can’t believe that it comes from a grocery store.  The produce is also another reason why I come here, always fresh and at a great price!</Text>

<rating>3</rating><text>The closest grocery store to me, I mostly buy my stuff from here but sometimes I feel I pay way too much for some stuff that really doesn’t worth it. Anyway, you can find good brands and fresh meats and fishes.
In fruit department tho, if you see stuff specially berries on sale make sure that you choose those that they aren’t already bad yet, and consume it right after.
Always look for the expiration dates.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<name>b. n. c. designs< /name><text>This used to be one of the best, if not the best, big chain grocery store in Riverside. I've been going here for years and i know many people who travel from nearby towns to go here and every single one of them have said this place has gone down hill. They no longer carry any of the items we used to specifically go there for. Meat quality has gone down and selection is almost down to Food-4-less status. I know they are both Kroger, and maybe thats what they are trying to turn into. I live exactly one mile away and I am now going to all of the other local grocery stores to try and find the food that i like. I will now only go here when i need a very common item in a hurry, otherwise i dont waste my time. Used to be 5 stars, now its 3 and falling</text>< GmapID>

Friendly staff,  Fresh breads but produce has never been good. After numerous visits, both the fresh fruit and vegetables either go bad faster or just don't have the same flavor. I haven't tried the meat yet but the store ok.< /text>

<text>This used to be a single owned store. It was bought out and turned into a Ralphs. I really like this store (location) as it is higher-end than normal Ralphs with quality of produce and meat. My favorite is the deli counter that offered Boars Head meat and cheeses. I go there every time I need to shop and have not come home disappointed.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

They haven't changed one bit. Moldy Produce being sold at Ralphs, This potato was purposely flipped over to cover the mold from showing in it's display, i picked it up to purchase and quickly saw this growing mold. Who ever placed it didn't care. They NEED TO CLEAN their facility because this potato has obviously been sitting amongst the batch which quickly spreads mold.  and Moldy Old vegies from the "sealed" Kroger mixed veggies/spring mix. they got me twice, i went open and opened to see the slimey old mess.< /Text>

Common though,  yes younger women shop here, and we are not looking for old lady pants, we need pads with wings !< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dcafb14e9f34c1:0xd505a07da43a3733<//gmap_id><resp>None</resp><Name>Stephani Chandler< /Name>< rate>

Great supermarket for UCR students since it is open very late.  It's also located in a safe area so you likely won't run into any issues late at night.</review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I had a very bad experience on Tuesday 1/09/18. I've never had a problem with any of the associates. On this evening the evening manager was very rude, argument and basically called me a liar over toothbrushes. I thought it was just myself, but after speaking with my peers. I learned they had experienced the same treatment earlier. I get off in the evening, I stop by on my way home. Going forward, I will not be stopping if he is there.< /Text>< Pics>

Kinda disappointed because I used to always shop here and it was always a good experience. Not today, nothing was stocked so I had to make do. It wasn't as clean as I'm used to. And to make matters worse the bagger forgot to put TWO items I paid for in the bag. And of course I didn't see it until I get ALL THE WAY HOME! Not sure I will go here any more! Off to the new Stater Bros. It's closer anyway.< /Text><userid>100620244944254224011<//userid><user_name>Bethany Hayes</user_name>< rating>

Yes your store is lovely. There was two incidences with the male who bags the groceries. He embarrassed us twice once to my 35 year old daughter. And to me in the line in front of your worker. I will not come to your store at night again. This worker we found was very strange.< /Review>

The rest of the store is not bad but the Bakery and Deli are terrible. The employees walk by and pretend to not see you or hide in the back room and hope that someone else will help you. I once waited for 20 minutes for any employee to actually acknowledge that I was even standing at the Bakery counter. I finally had to go and get a manager. The sandwich bar is especially awful. The menu used to be much more helpful and now every time I go in there the employees either have no idea how to make a sandwich, my sandwich ends up poorly made, or both. They also overcharge for their sandwiches. There are at least two other sandwich shops in the same plaza, which I will be patronizing from now on, and most of them are less expensive.< /text>

Horrible. Just don't shop here. They are extremely rude. Especially the Ugly Blonde sales manager lady that was on register at 6pm on 12/21/13 . She said I couldn't use coupons on my order because I already had the save $40 promotion. It says all discounts, not coupons. Discounts meaning the Ralph's card and sales.....<//text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>Oceanview Pavilion Event Venue is small but fun. The animals seem really happy and are very well taken care of. The giraffes exhibit was our favorite. They seemed so playful and we loved that they came so close to get a drink. Great selfie opportunity!
I recommend bringing your lunch with you (Stop and get a Indio Special sandwich on dutch crunch from George's Zoo Liquor Deli).<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Championship Wrestling From Hollywood!! Totally FREE to get in and the event lasted over 3 hours! I believe they have it every 5 weeks or so, just check online. Loads of fun with my Son and great clean Family entertainment. What's not to like?</review>

<date>1575751360931<//date><Review>It's a long way for us to drive, but to see EJ SPARKS, my son in action wrestling live and walking out on the beach, watching the kids play in the water, the Seagulls fly and walk around and watching the waves/rides roll in and out is so cool. I love it.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80e84fa5fbe70a1b:0x748941246c6ad2f9</Gmap_id><userid>114119061175772559330< /userid><Name>Lisa Jolly</Name>< Resp>

<Review>This place is located in a great area right by the beach but too many opportunities to take beautiful pictures.

Ocean View as a lot of spaces  and their service is beyond excellence .
service is excellent.  This place is great for any events such as  wedding birthday parties public events or business venues.
Owner is a great and kind person, staffs are excellent.
This place is highly recommended.</Review><time>1560484581785< /time><userid>115455233756129797545<//userid>< user_name>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>Good venue, cant complain, adequate indoor and outdoor place, Bathrooms got a little messy no one around to clean, right across from the beach, only thing I didnt care for was there was a man who had to be starting "closing up" things around 930 and we were scheduled to be there till 11. Thats a whole hour and a half early. Im pretty sure no one noticed but me but all night the doors to the parking area were open with a large fan, I was sitting by this door specifically bc it was cool air coming in so I when i saw him turn off the fan I thought ok its technically outside but seems to be still cool but then he closed the door! No more air and thats what caused me to look at my watch in the first place ot was only 930</text>< gmap_id>

<gmapID>0x808fc6b77ece0229:0xb2c17857309e759< /gmapID><review>Dr. Tisdale has been our vet for about 30 years.  He has tremendous knowledge and experience and can be relied upon to find low cost alternatives when available.  He's a great general vet with his wealth of experience and knowledge and has seen our many cats and dogs from beginning to end over the years with loving and care.  (We had one cat with diabetes for 8 years that lived to be 18 under his care.)  Dr. Tisdale will recommend a specialist when needed but most symptoms or medical issues are resolved with experience and solutions in the office without expensive referrals.<//review>< name>

Dr Tisdale is an amazing compassionate doctor who really cares about the health of your pets. He has always taken the best care of of my German Shepherd.

If your searching for a Vetrinarian I recommend you place him on the top of your list.

The office staff is always friendly and accommodate you every time.<//review>

<text>I would say I had a 9/10 experience here.

My cat was showing repeated signs of facial swelling, and after a trip to urgent care, brought him to Robert for a follow-up.

The wait was long due to some confusion in booking, but they didn't turn me away (happy for that!). I thought Robert's look at my cat was thorough, he was genuinely curious about potential contributing factors, and calmed some of my fears about the more negative possibilities.

By the end, I was still a little uncomfortable and Vet Tisdale made a point to recommend specific response behaviors if I'm worried about my cat in the future (including prescribing a reasonably priced treatment for an emergency situation).

The only reason I took off a point (9 instead of 10) was that we got the middle exam room. No windows. I had never been in a vet's office that didn't have windows for the animals to look out.

I know. Small thing. Stupid. You decide. It's still 5 stars.< /text><username>Shawn Pitman<//username><Gmap_id>0x808fc6b77ece0229:0xb2c17857309e759</Gmap_id>< Rate>

Dr. Tisdale is the best veterinarian out of all the veterinarians my 17 years old cat had visited.  He is professional, knowledgeable, willing to listen, and offers best approach to help his patients.  I highly recommend him and wish I had found him much earlier when my cat was young.< /review>

Dr. Tisdale and Suzanne (office manager ?) were SO VERY KIND to me and my girl cat Angel that THEY SQUEEZED US IN to a tight schedule having never seen us before!!!!! Also, they SAW US  AT THE APPOINTMENT TIME AS SCHEDULED, rather than making us wait an hour or two as I have with other vets and medical doctors in the past. The fee was very reasonable, again being so very kind, as to NOT GAUGE MY BANK ACCOUNT as several other vets have in the recent past.  Thank you so much!!!

Ive been taking pets here for well over a decade. They kept my old boy alive for 2 more years with regular fluid injections and B12 shots. My cat was very happy during that time and I don't think I would ever find a vet like this that has the animal's health in mind before profitability.

I had a very disappointing experience today when I called to schedule  neutering for my puppy. The receptionist was extremely rude and seemed to have no time to communicate, and she gave me incorrect information on the vaccination record and asked me to bring in my dog for vaccination again. When I mentioned that I remember we have completed all vaccinations she insisted that I missed a vaccination and literally lost my money, and now have to do a second series. When I tried to clarify on it she said "I don't know mam... I don't have time for that and call back later...! and I said I just called to schedule a neutering appointment! she was so resistant and rude to clarify this vaccine thing she brought up...and finally she booked the appointment I wanted. It turned out that the record I have was right and I called her back and said they need to be careful with their medical records. Extremely rude receptionist! I had good experiences with other receptionists in the past. Unfortunately a bad experience for me today!<//Text>

We took our dog ( Riley) to see Dr Tisdale.
From the moment the doc came in the room we felt a instant connection with him. He spent  time getting to know our baby. He explained all our concerns about Riley's health to us in great detail. Riley liked the Doc too.
Dr Tisdale's staff is amazing as well. It's nice to be in a happy place! Thank you all!< /text>

We've been to three different Veterinary Doctors in the past 40 + years and so glad we found Dr. Tisdale several years ago.  He is a very compassionate, caring and intelligent Doctor and I totally trust him with his opinions and I know he wouldn't do ANYTHING that wasn't absolutely necessary to our fur babies.  He just did some surgery on our German Shepherd this past Friday and she is doing beautifully.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful and very nice.  Dr. Tisdale is our choice for a fantastic Doctor!< /review>

I wish I was a dog,   Doctor Robert Tinsdale has extreme experience mixed with empathy and compassion for dog and human dog owner.
I brought my  13 year old Husky to Dr Robert Tinsdale with a large tumor on her cheek the size of a baseball. Upon meeting him for the first time  Dr. Robert Tisdale said, “ I can fix that “  Now, Juno looks like she had a beauty face lift.
But most important I thought that it was time to put my dog down yes end her suffering. When Dr. Tisdale told me she would live I was so surprised and overjoyed I started to cry. My previous Vet said just leave the tumor alone. I strongly recommend Dr .Tisdale and his staff that greets you  upon entering the door. Like I said before, l I wish I was a dog so I can get exceptional care and recheck appts to follow up. Thanks D Tisdale !

<Text>I took our family cat in for a check-up as she had been missing for two weeks. Dr. Tisdale and his staff were very professional in their handling of our cat and their treatment approach. Dr. Tisdale clearly loves animals and is extensively knowledgeable about common cat ailments and provided a lot of worthwhile recommendations to ensure long-term health for our cat. Recommendations we've taken to heart. Thank you Dr. Tisdale and staff!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Used to bring my dog here often but moved recently. I'm looking for contact info for records and thought to myself "They absolutely deserve a great review for all the times they saw my pup."

They're super professional. Because I've brought my dog a number of times I haven't always been able to see Dr. Tisdale. Think I've seen two others there who managed her needs. Regardless, They've always done really great. They seem straightforward about your pets health and will tell you what they probably need but wont aggressively push extra on you that the pet probably doesn't actually need. I hope to find a clinic like this where I live now.<//Text>< user_id>

<Text>We love Dr. Tisdale! I’ve never had a pet before so was nervous about choosing the right vet for our new puppy lab, Elvis.

Elvis loved Dr. Tisdale and responded really well to his voice and demeanor. He didn’t even notice he was getting shots.

The doctor took so much time to answer all my questions and give me great, much needed advice.

I’m so happy and relieved we found him!!</Text>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Text>20 years later reconnected with Dr Tisdale’s office after a botched up surgical and post-operative care fiasco at Med-Vet Silicon Valley, San Jose for removal of a malignant Apocrine Gland tumor from our 14 year old Tibetan terrier.
It was a pleasure to not only see Dr Tisdale deliver his quality care but to be able to walk into the office with our pet.
The past 7 or more visits to the other Vets entailed tying your dog out before he was taken in and awaiting  a call from the Vet with some grim prognosis or the other followed by an equally fat bill.
Finally, we are relieved that we are getting the proper care for our pet.
Dr Tisdale has addressed all our concerns right from the dog’s diet to the care of his wound as well as our role as caregivers as and when his tumor progresses, with sensitivity and humor.
Best of all, the cost is so affordable, we have no issues seeing him every other day.
Don’t go with fancy vet offices, their complex treatment options and big talk....quality care lies in experience, simplicity, and truth that Dr Tisdale amply provides!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fc6b77ece0229:0xb2c17857309e759<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We called this place to get an appointment for one of our pets but whoever we talked to was not very smart and didn't communicate with us properly. Based on that we gave our business to someone else. Thanks for losing future customer.< /Review>

<Review>Dr. Tisdale was spot on diagnosing my dog's lethargy! He told us that this very "sensitive dog," aka whimp, was hurting from either a sprain or stomach ache. The treatment was the same either way: some pain pills mixed in some low fat canned dog food that would be easy to digest. He gradually started eating and in 4 days he was completely back to normal. Big relief!<//Review><Name>Sandra Adams</Name>< Response>

I was fed up with doctors who didn’t know a thing about dogs or care about them and two of my friends recommended  Dr. Tisdale.
I made an appointment immediately and was so happy I did. I felt relieved and happy that there are still doctors who actually love pets and know what they are doing.
My dog is like a baby to me and I owe it to her to give her the best care while she’s with me.
I love this clinic, Doctors and staff
So professional, courteous and prompt .. above all it doesn’t stink in there !! Yay !
Love you guys .. if you stay in business I’d feel comfortable getting some more pets !
I strongly recommend this place to anyone who loves their pet.<//review>

At times, we've needed last minute appointments and he's always made time to see us.  Our latest visit was due to our cat having pancreatitis.  It was a Saturday and close to closing and we walked in and he and his staff were ready to see us.  Thankfully the antibiotics he gave our cat has done wonders and our cat is feeling so much better.  I would highly recommend Dr. Tisdale.</Text>< pictures>

Dr. T, Dr. B, and the rest of the staff took great care of our elderly cat. She was quite the regular there, sometimes going weekly. They were caring, meticulous with her records, and flexible in squeezing in appointments last minute when issues would come up. They pretty much brought her back from the brink of death and helped her have a few extra golden years. I would recommend them to anyone.<//Review>

Dr. Tisdale has taken superb care of all of our 4-footed family members, dogs, rabbits and hamsters, for over 30 years.  His depth of knowledge and experience and compassionate approach to caring for animals is evident every time you speak with him. We have always appreciated his conservative approach to treatment - never recommending a particular course of treatment if there is another that is less invasive or less costly that will do the job.  You will not find a better veterinarian.< /Review>

<Text>We always have a great experience, though the dogs may not agree :) When we moved here we just defaulted to my in-laws' vet (Dr. Tisdale). They have been going to him for 20 years and it's no wonder. Dr. Tisdale and staff are excellent. Dr. Tisdale is such a pro; smart, knowledgeable and funny! He tells it like it is, doesn't "over diagnose" and never pressures you into buying anything unnecessary. Dr. Brovont is great, too! The vet techs are all wonderful and care about our dogs.  We love this vet!<//Text>< rate>

<text>We have been going to Dr. Tisdale for over 15 years and have never been disappointed. With his wealth of experience and knowledge he is often able to diagnose problems without the need for expensive tests. He is very personable and never hurrying to get you out of the office. Doctor Tisdale takes the time to explain things in plain terms that you can understand. Our cats and dogs throughout the years have thrived under his care.
Doctor Brovant is also a great addition to his practice.
The office staff are always cheerful and helpful, remembering our pet's names and truly care about the pets.
I would highly recommend The veterinary care you will receive.<//text>< pics>

I highly recommend Dr. Tisdale and his staff for your pet's needs.  If you are tired of the hustle and bustle of your busy life, you will definitely get the small town feel at this office. They genuinely care about your pets.  I walked to the back once, and saw my dog sound asleep in the staff's lap, as she was gently stroking her head and ears.  It was so sweet to see.< /Text>

We know that our animals, (now, 2 dogs and 2 cats) are being watched carefully, and everyone at the vet hospital is helpful in explaining what is going on with the health care and just everyday general care.

<review>I stumbled across Dr. Tisdale's office when I needed a new vet.  Dr. Tisdale and his staff treated me and my pets with so much care and honesty. It was a tough time for me, but they were so caring. I will forever be grateful for that. I live 30 min away from there office, but I trust them so much I don't mind the drive. With an older dog I visit them periodically and the care they have with him because he needs special attention is fantastic.
I highly recommend Dr. Tisdale and his staff for anyone looking for a caring and honest vet.</review>< Rate>

Dr. Tisdale has cared for my cats -- six in total, over 30+ years -- and he and his staff have always been wonderful, caring, and have provided the best and kindest care possible.  Dr. Tisdale's advice has always been spot-on, and he and everyone in his office have made me confident that my cats were in good hands.   When my cats reached the end of life, they all handled  that situation with real sensitivity.  I wouldn't think of having any other vet service take care of my cats.<//text>

Dr. Tisdale and his staff have provided my pets great service over the years. Dr. Tisdale is very good with my cats and knows how to handle them.  He also offers great value for his services. I have paid much, much more for services at other Vets and won't go back to them.AND I know he really cares for my animals versus other locations where I felt other Animal doctors saw my beloved companions as dollar signs to make money. He has a clean facility located in a great location near Ohlone College and Mission San Jose.
By the way, Dr. Tisdale also was in the US Military if you want to deal with a veteran.
If you are looking for great value and loving care for your animals then you should at least stop by and talk to his staff - once you do then you will better understand why I speak of Dr. Tisdale so highly.< /text>

I took all my pets to Dr. Tisdale over the years and his care was top notch.  Dr. Tisdale was recommended by my dog's breeder and I could not be happier with the attention he gave my pets.  Highly recommend!< /text>

Just brought in a new puppy addition to the household and Dr. Brovant was wonderful checking out the new pup, and also in taking care of our previous dog too.  Just a really friendly staff, also known Carolyn the tech for at least ten years, so the staff is fairly stable.  Nice that they take the time to listen to owners thoughts and questions.</text>< Pictures>

Love the staff! Like so many have said, they genuinely do care about our pets. My cat's first visit was for a skin condition (turned out to be a sensitivity to heat...poor boy!).  During the visit it was discovered that 4 of his teeth needed to come out.  I was really nervous about the surgery because he was 11 years old at the time.  My worries were unfounded as the surgery was really quick and he came out of anesthesia like a champ.  During the time he was out, my boy also got a thorough teeth cleaning, a bath and his nails done. A pleasant surprise was the fact that the bill was less than originally estimated because, as it turned out, only 2 of his teeth were bad and needed to come out.  We have begun taking him back every 2 months or so did get his nails done and the worst part of the visit is the car ride.  I would recommend to anyone with pets in the Fremont area that they make Dr. Tisdale their vet of choice.  Their pets will thank them!</text>

He has been treating Molly for about 8 years now. His care and caring have been first rate. Molly has a chronic condition and he has been excellant helping us manage it. She is also a very cranky cat and he & his staff are able to handle her with no harm to anyone.  I would highly recommend him< /Text>

Both Dr. Tisdale & Dr. Brovont care & are interested in our beloved pets health & well being, as is the staff as well at this vet practice.  They take the time to make sure I understand what is going on, discussing options & answering questions.  They are  experienced, compassionate & technically skilled in the exam room & in surgery.  Your pet is in good hands here!</review>

Knowing Doc T is caring for my furry family makes me know they're in the best hands. He's treated and diagnosed more illnesses and ailments, eased more fears, helped say goodbye to beloved friends... Don't know what we'd do without him...If I could give more stars I would!</review>

<Text>I've been taking my cats (and now a dog) to Dr. Tisdale for many years.  He is one of the few veterinarians who has been established in the Fremont area for several decades and I trust his experience.  Years ago, I had dental work done on my senior cat and she recovered nicely, living several more healthy years that I treasured.  I wouldn't have trusted any other veterinarian with my frail cat.  She passed away at age 20 but during her last year or so, she required subcutaneous fluids and when I was squeamish with the needle, Dr. Tisdale charged me a very low rate to bring my cat into the office regularly to have one of his staff administer the fluid.  He and his staff eventually taught me how to manage the fluids myself and they always made sure I had all the needed supplies.  I'll forever be grateful for their time and compassion.  My current pets and I are looking forward to many more years with Dr. Tisdale and his staff.</Text>< Resp>

Our young dog has a chronic condition and he and his staff are wonderful at providing care and reminders.

The staff was very understanding and Dr. Tisdale was supportive and caring as we attended to our elderly dog in his final days.  They made it possible for us to take him home with us and still provide care.

In face, we just adopted a dog from the TriCity Animal Shelter last week, and are scheduling his first check up with Dr. Tisdale.

Over the years, we have recommended to our friends and family that they utilize this wonderful practice.

We love them!!</text>< Rating>

I am not 100% sure on dr. Tisdall although I've been going to him for a very long time. I just don't feel the connection between he and I or he and my pet.<//Text>

<review>Dr. Tilsdale and his staff are incredible with animals of all kinds. My cat Primo has had numerous injuries as cats do. He also has allergies. Dr Tilsdale has always been there for us and goes above and beyond to make sure we get the assistance we need. We are grateful - our cat is healthy and happy thanks to Dr. Tilsdale and his team.</review>< pics>

< Review>
My cat Linus had a goth on his right cheek. He is diabetic  and lately  the lump has gotten  bigger and he scratches  it and it bleeds. I was worried  that being diabetic  it will get infected so Dr Tisdale said he could quickly  remove it. So today was the day and I was scared at first because they were going to put him out to do it. Dr Tisdale let me be in the roomorning the whole time while they gave him anesthesia,  then watched as the grother was removed,  then let me be there while he woke up. It came out way better than I thought and being there helped my fears. He woke up great I waited a little while and took him home. Dr Tisdale is a great man, a very confident  surgeon,  and someone I will always trust the life of my babies with . Thank you sooo much</Review>

I have taking my almost 4 year old Sheltie who is my baby to Dr. Tisdale since I have had her as  a puppy.  I love the attention and care she gets especially the follow ups from Dr. Tisdale's practice.  I went there following the recommendation of a friend who had been taking her golden there for 14 years.  I would not trust her care to anyone else. I especially appreciate the understanding of the staff who relate to the fact that your pet is not just your pet but is an integral part of you family and your life and treat them accordingly.  Anyone who takes their pet to Dr. Tisdale's clinic cannot go wrong - as they say animals can sense a good person when they see one and believe me my babygirl adores him!<//text>

I've brought all of my dogs to Dr. Tisdale's office for their various needs. Recently, I adopted a new puppy and, funds being tight, I looked around for a better deal for his basic shot series with the intent of transferring him over to Dr. Tisdale after that set of four. My little guy is friendly and out-going but he did not like the bargain vet. By the second visit, he was tentative. By the third, he was hiding under my chair but I was able to coax him out. By his final visit, he was under the chair and I had a hard time getting him out until I headed for the door. As I was with him the whole time, I couldn't understand why he was uncomfortable. Granted, no one really played or introduced themselves to him but I didn't see anything to upset him. I was personally unhappy as I felt like I was being nickeled and dimed for every other service he might need. But, I expected this...

Fast forward to last week...my little guy and my big guy were playing and as sometimes happens they got a bit overexcited. I hear a crash and here comes my little guy with the "I didn't do it look" on his face. A few minutes later, I realize he is bleeding and needs stitches. So, of course, I call Dr. Tisdale's office. Shadow is going through a shy phase right now but he quickly warmed up to Dr. Tisdale's awesome staff and the new vet who easily won a few puppy kisses in no time! In less than an hour, he was awake, stitched and trying to escape his cone.

As I've always experienced with Dr. Tisdale's office, his staff was friendly toward me and, most importantly, toward my puppy. Already nervous, they took the few minutes to get acquainted with him that he needed and talked to him the whole time--even when he was asleep. They even made sure to ask that my big guy, Blue, was undamaged in the crash of glass. This is a first rate staff and one that tends to stick around...the vet techs have been there forever!! They remember my big guy and the one before him. You just can't ask for more than to have first rate care from your vet AND his staff but to have them like and care about your pets is amazing!!< /text>

<text>Horrible chow mein it’s like eating plastic , there food is never edible I’ve tried it couple of times hence this is not the first time . But today’s food was something they wouldn’t give more than one sample and I ended up eating stale spicy chicken curry and plastic noodles . I managed to eat the chicken a little . Never let your children eat here pls . It’s definitely not healthy food .</text><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

This spot is the one I like best. I visit a lot of restaurants but to this restaurant I go the most. The stuff is very affectionate and the food they serve is so yummy. I never decline to have a good meal in this restaurant. I highly recommend this place.</text>

Fancy Thai food in a prime location is what you're paying for. You could go across the street to the other a Thai restaurant and have a good meal for half the price.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Worst Thai food I have ever had in my life.
I was in a hurry to grab something back today.   Thought what one could go wrong with Thai food.  Big Mistake.
Pad Thai, really?  What they cooked is not pad thai.  I think I can make it better than this.  had few bites because I was hungry then dumped it in the garbage.  Their spicy chicken was same.  Not sure whether it was even real thai dish, think not.
Do not waste your money on this food.<//Text>< user_name>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I rarely give reviews but this is exceptional. This is the worst pad Thai I’ve ever tasted. Went to Thailand recently and even the pad thai on the sidewalk cannot compete on this. How can you call it pad thai if it’s just long yellow ribbons of stuff with extra plastic flavor. Unacceptable, never again. I should give minus one thousand over 5 star if it’s applicable.< /Text>< pics>

As a vegetarian,  this food at this place is great!  I usually get half pad Thai,  half fried rice and a side of egg plant tofu.  They claim that there are no eggs or meat in any of those items, awesome!!

So why the two stars?  The lady that rang me up was unbelievable rude. I asked her for a couple of extra sriracha packets,  and she absolutely through a fit, saying they only give one and I don't need more. She said,  "are you serious!!?"  with a very disgusted and disturbed face.  I was baffled.  Over two sriracha packets?  Come on lady.

I'll probably go back,  but as far as reviews go,  two stars it is.<//Review>

If you didn't order from Ruby Thai, then the cashier won't serve you anything. My companion asked for a cup of water and the cashier preferred he bought something beforehand. We already bought lunch from a different restaurant and thought asking for a cup of water from Ruby Thai would be ok, but turns out you should pay first. I've tried Ruby Thai before and it wasn't that great. The food was too greasy and salty.</Text>

It adds up from asked prices, not happy. I don’t recommend this place at all. I’m skeptical about rating that they have. Very disappointing .  You want me to open my identity? I’m Tina you’ve said shipping  cost was included in the price from the beginning. You’ve quoted me double shipping price so I’ve gave you a credit card number even though you’ve agreed to pay for shipping from the first place. And than 30 minutes later you paid half of the shipping cost but yet, you’ve  still charged me.  You said you’ll give me refund and you never did.  That’s being dishonest I’m very disappointed about your actions.< /text>< Pictures>

I came here today to take some passport photos because I need to get my passport renewed. It costs $20 for 4 photos, which I think is a great deal because they also do a touch up on your photo which made it look great! I was not charged extra for the photo touch up like the other reviewer said. I'm not sure if they went to the same place because the lady that helped me and took my pictures was very kind and helpful. I love my photos! Way better than getting your picture taken at the passport place :) Will be recommending my friends to come here! Thanks so much Jenny!!< /review>

<review>If there is ZERO star, i would like to give that, i was very disappointed this store. The price of passport picture is $20 and  they offer a photoshop service to revise the picture looking better then you need to pay $10 more.  However, their skill for revising level is very low and it makes picture look worst. i don't get it... also the service for customer was very disrespectful...</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c77bef259679:0x5aec9348ba5359e2< /GmapID></record>

I've been getting waxed for years, and this place has become my favorite. A place you can feel comfortable in with your pants down. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Super clean establishment, 10/10 would/do recommend.</review>

I was very pleased with my first experience here with Amber. Upon arrival, I was offered a glass of wine and she even asked and played my favourite music genre. The room was clean and comfortable with a plush reclining chair. I got a full Brazilian in under 20 mins and was sure to schedule my next appointment before I left.<//Text>

This is the best salon in oc. I have been seeing amber for about a year and she is the best! Bee sugared is such a fun salon with friendly staff, exactly what you need when you’re getting a Brazilian! I recommend bee sugared to everyone who is looking for a salon!<//Text>

<review>I started coming here about 2 years ago through a Groupon discount and I couldn’t be happier with the services I have been provided! I quickly became a member. Amber is amazing! Super personable, professional, and proficient! Scheduling is easy and the environment is clean and welcoming! I highly recommend!< /review>< Response>

< Review>
This place is great! The staff is really nice, the store is clean and they have COMPLIMENTARY WINE! Also, Laura is the one that has got me hooked on getting sugared! I never knew much about it and I was nervous my first time honestly. Laura made me feel super comfortable, was very informative and was very patient for my first time. She made sure everything was done perfectly to my preference and that I left 100% satisfied. Ever since then, I’ve been going back to her every month! Shes also super down to earth and fun to talk to too! HIGHLY recommend booking with Laura!!!</Review>

I was greeted as soon as I arrived and welcomed, filled out a simple form for new clients and offered a beverage while I waited. My services were done by Amber and she is so sweet and professional! Totally put me at ease and we chatted the whole time, sugaring is really the best! Thank you ladies at BeeSugared, I cannot wait to come back!</review>< resp>

<review>I’ve been going to Bee Sugared for about a year now and I love it ! Very cute place and very professional.  Good vibes, good people and great customer service.  Everyone is very nice!   But my girl Ciara is the best.  She’s so sweet and gentle and talked me through it the first time I was trying sugar wax.  I was so nervous and she made me feel so comfortable !! I totally recommend her and Bee sugared to everyone.<//review>< Rating>

I’ve been to other sugaring places before, but this is by far my favorite! Everyone is so nice and genuine. Ciara always takes such good care of me and somehow makes the pain of sugaring bearable! The membership is unbeatable and I definitely recommend.< /text>

I recently booked a facial with Laura & if i must say.. she is great! Her facials massages are very relaxing.. i fell asleep so fast! Also If you let her know about your problematic concerns, she tries her best to tend them. I recommend her 100% at BeeSugared. Thanks Laura!< /Review>

<Text>Seriously... This place has been a lifesaver. We are trying to conceive and the baby hormones have turned me into a modern day bearded lady. The BeeSugared staff is non-judgemental and friendly and the atomosphere is so relaxing. I look forward to going every two weeks! Amber is truly the best!

The only place I'll go to get sugared! I've been to a few other spots in Orange County but none even compare to this one. Pricing is incredibly fair, services are professional and extremely well done, and everyone that works here is so genuine and kind. Not to mention Ciara who I've been seeing for about a year now, I look forward to going here because of her!< /text>

I’d 100% recommend coming here to be sugared. Sugaring has been a game changer for me, ever since I switched from waxing! Ciara is the best sugarist! She turns this really awkward thing into a super comfortable and laid back experience.<//text>

<Text>Nice and clean atmosphere with an amazing staff. Laura was my sugarist, and she was awesome! I was pretty shy because I was getting a Brazilian, but Laura made me feel super comfortable and I even forgot she was sugaring my lady parts haha. I definitely recommend this salon for your sugaring needs. :)<//Text><Date>1537568819837<//Date><UserId.>106734946207786555399<//UserId.>< Pics>

Great experience, it went as well as it possibly could have being my first time sugaring! Ciara was amazing and gave me breaks whenever I needed, great conversation, good music, and just overall was a super pleasant person to be around; if she wasn’t doing it, I likely would not have enjoyed the expeience so much The end quality was amazing as well as the whole feel of the salon, I’d recommend!<//Text>

I get waxed by Ciara more than three times. The restroom and treatment rooms here are always clean and nice.  The parking lot is a little tight but it's good bc it's only for the plaza and it's free.< /Review>

I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of O'Neal Esthetics! As a longtime Sugar Sugar client, originally referred by Yelp, I was excited to hear of the salon's expansion and remodel. And let me tell you, it has been worth the wait! 3 treatment rooms instead of one, a larger waiting area, and expanded hours....woohoo!

I worked with Dominique today; she was professional and just all-around a lovely person! She had lots of great tips to reduce ingrown hairs (the bane of my existence, argh!) and sprinkled me with skincare knowledge to better moisturize my face.

I will definitely be going back again and thanking the sugaring gods that I don't have to go back to another waxing parlor (I had to go once while the salon was shut down and it reaffirmed why I'm a sugaring convert).

Can't wait to go back and try some other services like their new facials. Go get sugared...you will not regret it!<//Text>

<Review>Beesugared was amazing! It was my first time sugaring and I was really nervous. I had Ciara and she  was so sweet and calming. She talked me thru the entire process and did not make me feel rushed at all. At times I asked her to stop so I could take a second and she was so nice about it. I will defiantly be back!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Love Beesugared! I'm from Napa so I was looking for a place close by and found this cute lil shop. I get brazillian sugars from Cierra and the first time we met she was super sweet and made sure I was comfortable and even asked what genre of music I want playing. She was quick yet thorough and I immediately scheduled my next appointment while I was paying. Today I missed that appointment from sleeping in and when I called to explain the situation she was super accommodating and took an early lunch so she could squeeze me in for a later session the same day! Awesome customer service and definitley would recommend to anyone looking for great sugaring at a low cost :)<//Text>

It’s been a long time since I physically walked into an AT&T store. I was helped by Brianna. She was very helpful and knew exactly what I needed. She was efficient and friendly. Brianna helped set up a new number for my daughter and went above and beyond to get us up and running. We showed up 2 days later with more questions. We chose Brianna to assist us. Once again I would give her 10/10. There should be more people like Brianna to make customers happy.<//review>

<review>Brandon S. was so very helpful, patient and went above and beyond for us! He saved us 25% on our monthly bill and even got us free HBO+. I bought a new Apple Watch and had difficulties getting connected with our cellular plan. The Apple store is no longer able to help customers set-up their devices.  Brandon made sure my cellular plan was connected and even helped me understand my watch. My husband and I appreciated his patience and the time he took answering all of my questions. Saving money on our bill was a total bonus and the HBO was a hidden gem! Thank you Brandon! I’m sending all my friends over to you!</review>< Resp>

<text>I went in to see Brandon to get a new phone and his service was exceptional! From start to finish he helped me set up my new phone.

I really, really cannot say enough about the professionalism of this team. The team is apparently very tenured, all having worked in this location for a while together so when you are in the store, customers will come in consistently asking  for a particular staff member by name. Almost feels like Cheers-that old TV show about a bar in Boston "where everybody knows your name". Pretty Cool. I figure if that many people keep coming back for service here, this team must be doing something right!<//text>

<review>I was very satisfied with my service. I've been visiting this location for my wireless needs for about 6 years or so. As long as I can remember, Trevor has always been great and I always see the same staff. It shows how great management is there. Each individual staff member I come across in this store is always friendly, knowledgeable, patient, and helpful. This visit was no different. I came in on the later side and had to wait outside due to covid restrictions. The staff was kind in letting me know and said they would walk up and wave me in when it was safe to do so. Even though I started the process of purchasing my new phone late, they were patient and I never felt rushed to finish. In times like these, we need more people like Trevor and his team. I hope they see this and I hope they know they are appreciated.< /review>< Pics>

Hands down the best ATT experience I have ever had. Brandon went out of his way to ensure I got the right plans and all my devices set up.  I was on the edge about moving to ATT at first.  But after working with Brandon I moved all my family’s devices over.< /Review>

<date>1617087860835<//date><Rate>5</Rate><review>I needed to upgrade my daughter’s iPhone so I’ve decided to go to a local AT&T retailer. But instead of going to the nearest store from my house, I chose this store in Burlingame which I’ve never visited before. And that was the best choice I’ve ever made by walking into this retailer, because LJ went above and beyond for me. He was very friendly and really cared about his customer. He gave me advice on how to save money on my monthly bills and recommended using their promotional programs like BOGO, trade-in of old phones, a set of phone accessory deals, etc..). While an Apple store clerk talked me into buying Apple care on the new iPhone I bought, LJ suggested to cancel it since the upgraded phone was already covered by the AT&T insurance, and their insurance was even better than the Apple’s. I highly recommend this store if you’re especially thinking about opening a new account, adding another phone line, or purchasing new devices.</review>< Pictures>

<review>I went into this AT&T store just to add a line for my old phone and did no expect much.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive such outstanding service from LJ the associate who helped me.  Since I was giving my old phone to my mom, he gave me great advice and suggestions so that my mom would be more receptive and inclined to use the phone.  I really appreciate his knowledge, professionalism and his time which is sometimes missing in retail settings during these days of COVID.</review>< Resp>

Trevor was so helpful!! Our MIL needed to upgrade (from a 5!!) and he walked her through the options without any pressure.  By far, this was the BEST experience we have ever had at an AT&T store.  Go see Trevor!</text>

<Review>I gotta be honest, speaking with ATT over the phone was challenging. We walked over to our local store where we met with Brandon and received the best customer service we could ask for. Brandon is knowledgeable, friendly, and super chill. We will be coming back to him and this store for our future ATT needs!< /Review>< Pictures>

However AT&T shut off my autopay in September, and when I contacted their customer service they demanded that I give them a new credit card. It turned out that they were seeking to charge me for delinquent accounts that had nothing to do with me. My repeated attempts to correct the situation with customer service failed and I feared that I had been the victim of identity theft. I ended up filing a six page complaint through the FCC.  The AT&T customer service agent in the President's Office established that these accounts were not mine and restored my account, but I reached this point only after many hours of effort.  I got excellent service at the AT&T store, and useful phone service that met my needs. It's a pity that their billing office could not sort things out without my taking extreme measures.  I will not be continuing this phone service with AT&T since I don't think they are a trustworthy business.< /Review>< pictures>

Brandon at the Burlingame AT&T store is the BEST.  I managed to get totally confused between user ID, passwords and my multiple AT&T accounts (Internet, Wireless, phone line).  For the 2nd time, Brandon sorted it out  for me as well as advising on how to navigate the confusing world of AT&T apps and products.</text>

<Text>I have been following Trevor at a few stores he’s been working at. Trevor is simply the best at customer service. My mom and I truly value him and how he takes pride in his job. When ever we have a problem or situation about are cell service or internet he goes above and beyond to help us. He takes the time to listen to are needs and wants, he’s very patient with my mom as she gets extreme anxiety when having to deal with the public at times. My current product I bought, Trevor was great with helping me choose it and setting it up. He’s definitely an awesome store manager and continues to wow his customers which includes myself. He’s definitely a person that everyone should follow with AT&T as there are managers that have horrible customer service.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808f9df0541747b9:0x4bd16804b8e7bab3<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Brandon is the BEST!!! Honestly the best customer service experience I have had in my entire life. He's extremely knowledgeable and patient, taking the time to carefully explain all of my options. I have never felt so informed while buying a new phone!! He was very personable and made the entire process feel smooth, even as AT&T's internal system took a while to process my order. I am SO glad I went to this store and worked with Brandon, definitely made this a positive experience. I will definitely be back the next time I upgrade my phone. Thank you Brandon!</review>

Brandon is great, and helped me way back. I'm giving it two stars because when I decided to come back to inquire and possibly get a phone within the same day. The asian woman was very rude, looks like she hates her job and doesn't want to be there. I will only come back here whenever Brandon is free to assist me again, 10/10 for Brandon though!<//Review>

Brandon is the best customer care rep I have ever dealt with in my years of mobile store experience or just in any service business. He is patient, knowledgeable, smart and he simply cares. We need more people like him in the service industry and our world would be a happier place. We are grateful of what he has done for our cellular and internet needs.

Keep up the amazing work!< /Review>

<text>I came in to purchase a phone for my son. The customer service was terrific. They went above and beyond to assist me. We had some issues with the new OS and the transaction was very time consuming (this is no fault of the staff)but regardless, Brandon took his time with me and we eventually worked everything out. I can’t say enough nice things about how I was treated. The other thing I noticed while I was there, was that everyone was greeted as they walked in and even though it was busy, Brandon and his co-worker continually updated folks with their wait times. In a time when customer service is pretty much non-existent, the folks at AT&T in Burlingame haven’t forgotten that the customers , and the customer experience, are the most important thing. Thank you, Brandon!!!!!< /text>< user_name>

The customer service at this location is fantastic!  The agents spent a lot of time making sure we had exactly what we wanted and the best deals.  I would strongly recommend these guys.< /Text>

<Review>Honestly one of the worst experiences of my life. Trevor, the store manager, was just completely rude and very very confrontational. I felt like he was bullied as a kid and now as the 'big boy manager' he feels compelled to assert himself in an aggressive manner even towards elderly women. Terrible Terrible Terrible. I don't know how that guys gets through the day.</Review><user_id>115825056431303745733< /user_id>< GmapID>

5* is a no-brainer ... Brandon S's technical knowledge was faultless, but that's no why I'm writing this (I rarely write reviews), I'm writing on account of his exceptional humanity and fabulous customer service ... I so hung out in the store for a couple of hours and his colleagues also demonstrated how they went above and beyond for their customers (and some weren't the easiest either) ... Bravo - go here, you will not be disappointed... Respect< /text>

I was looking at a S9 but with 3 models, I wasn't sure which. I ended up buying the Note S9 but not because Brandon tried to upsell me, but because he highlighted some critical differences between models that made my choice significantly easier. So thank you Brandon for doing such a great job, during peak season, and making the experience great.</Text><user_name>Paul Sultani<//user_name>< user>

<review>I visited the Burlingame AT&T location today to apply for a veteran's discount, an excellent new program from AT&T.  I was greeted immediately by a representative named Breana who invited me to sit down and review my current services.   She researched my account, determined that I was eligible and found a better program for me that allowed me to take advantage of the veteran's discount.  I could not have asked for better service.  Breana was knowledgeable, fast, friendly and professional.  She even pointed some some additional benefits that I had overlooked.  If you need in-person help with your AT&T account, I highly recommend working with Breana, she knows the AT&T systems and services better than anyone I've ever met.< /review>< Pics>

Typical hole in the wall type of Mexican food joint but the flavor of the food is really good. I really like the carne asada burrito. The meat is flavorful and the salsas are great. The flip-side is the location and premises. Its run down and ugly to say the least but don’t let that discourage you. The food makes up for it.<//Review>

<Review>Food is good. But the female cashier is really rude and will act like she doesn’t understand you. They also charge to use credit card but have no visible sign and won’t let you know until you see your receipt. First and last time here. Terrible service.< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2ccd1b4503a5f:0x42599229613119ab<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We stopped by for breakfast, while  waiting to get the car’s window tinting. I had the posole and my husband had the al pastor tacos, both were delicious. They make their own corn tortillas. Super light, even for the dorados and chips. Glad we stopped by and enjoyed this place. Will come again!< /text>

I love their refried beans with the hand made tortillas. Their salsa is always bomb, except when the overweight cashier is there. She's stingy with the chips and waters down the salsa. The full time cook is funny and perverted. ☆☆☆☆☆ stars!</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) They should fix the schedule since "according" they open at 8am and the food is prepared until 8:30 am it would be better if they changed the schedule at 8:30 am so that people who want to go to breakfast do not waste their valuable time😉

(Original)
Deberían arreglar el horario ya que "segun" abren a las 8am y la comida la preparan asta las 8:30am seria mejor que cambiaran el horario a las 8:30am para que las personas que quieran ir a desayunar no pierdan su valioso tiempo😉< /Review>< userid>

< review>
I love this mall!!! The customer service in Nordstrom is incomparable. I dont know her name, but the lady helping us in the kids department today was AMAZING. She held our bags from other stores while we shopped, gift wrapped everything, she was super helpful. When we were done in Nordstrom she offered to hold all our purchases until we were done shopping! Having a positive shopping experience in the middle of COVID is difficult so I appreciated what felt like special treatment even though I know this is the norm for them!!!</review>

Nordstrom's felt like a ghost town during this time of our great pandemic however the store seemed properly staffed with staff sitting at all exits and entrances. I do believe this is to ensure that individuals are coming in with masks on as they're sitting next to pump bottles of hand sanitizer and I assume encouraging individuals to use that upon entry as well as wearing a mask. (I was already hitting the pump before he could suggest it) I purchased a sale item that was less than $5 it was a Chalk to use for artistic renditions of solar systems the spiral piece of chalks original price was $18. The checkout clerk was professional and kind, I stated that I needed to change my phone number for rewards and she asked me my original number used and told me I would need to update online. However, after giving her my number, she didn't say anything I think that's because I don't have a Nordstrom account setup I imagine she didn't want to embarrass me about not having an account to begin with, however she also did not point me in the right direction of how to set up a account. so I will take to the website and see what it is all about. I'm not a frequent Nordstrom shopper however not opposed to it especially if there are good sales happening!<//Review>

I forgot the catch the name of one the male employees that works in the men department near the AG pants section. He was absolutely kind, courteous and super helpful finding my partner the right pants. He was extremely accommodating and patient. I hope to see him again when we swing by for another shopping spree, we received 10/10 service from him!< /review>

I know how that feels because it happens a lot. And the black guy in the purple suit, a floor manager, was very intrusive in my shopping experience. They need to be retrained.

< review>
I saw what I wanted in the handbag department but there was no salesperson in sight. Walked over to hosiery to find a nice young lady who walked over to handbags with me. She found the sales lady speaking to someone (the conversation sounded like friends). Would have been nice to have a warmer greeting from the handbag sales lady but whatever.
I like my new wallet!</review>

<Text>Wish I caught the name of the sales associate who helped me -- they were phenomenal and I'm going to call the store after writing this review!

I've lived as both a small and large woman, and am now plus sized. As such, I've experienced a wide range of treatment: always warm when I was a size 6, but wildly ranging as my weight crept up.

Shopping the sparse plus sized department at this Nordstrom, I had a few items to try on. Because the associate in the plus department disappeared after greeting me, I had to seek out the associate in the kids department across the store. (Pretty common, as most department stores treat plus size retail and staffing as low priority). From the outset, they treated me warmly and didn't mention that they were now forced to cover a department that was not theirs. They promised to check on me in a few minutes, and actually did.

I found a pair of jeans I loved but was hoping to locate a jacket that was available in store according to the Nordstrom app but nowhere to be found in person. Not only did they perform the online stock search, showing me the results, but when it couldn't be found they asked if it was okay if they did a quick pass to scour the racks to locate it. Even though it was nowhere to be found and I was disappointed that I couldn't purchase the item, I was thrilled at their attentiveness, kindness, and enthusiasm to assist. Even though I spend about $5k+ at Nordstrom annually, most of that is spent online because of inadequate stock as well as a lack of service in the plus department. This associate is a model of service and I'm grateful for their expertise and kindness.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

May not look aesthetically as pleasing as the other department stores in the area; however, do not let that turn you off. They certainly make up for it with their customer service and attentiveness.<//review>

< review>
I went here to get my wife some perfume for our anniversary. The customer service was excellent. They did not treat me like I didn't belong there they went through he perfume and let me smell them all without getting agitated. When I found the one I wanted they were really helpful in packaging it up for me. As I walked around the store staff was always there asking if they could help me but not pushing me to buy something.</review>

Awesome store with easy accessibility, only took me about 20 minutes to shop the small men's casual wear department. At a massive department store with 4 floors, I'd have thought they'd provide at least a single floor dedicated to men's clothing. Very disappointing!

Help was awesome though, even agreeing with me that the men's clothing is almost non-existent.</Review>

I prefer to not give out my email address to retailers. The first tailor was fine, but the second refused to help me without it. Ten minutes after I was strong armed into giving it up I had my first Nordstrom spam email.< /Text>

<Date>1563011698815< /Date><Rate>1</Rate><text>As a tourist I visited Nordstrom to buy some clothes. I selected around 16 items, but when I went to the cashier to purchase them, I was told that I could not as I was not a member of their loyalty program. As I am from the uk, and there isn't a Nordstrom there, I can never be one. I found this odd as that means that Nordstrom is actively saying that they do not want to sell to people who are not part of their loyalty scheme.

I took this up with their customer service, and essentially received a response that, my understanding is correct.

So, my advice for any tourists looking to visit Nordstrom is that DON'T!!!! You will waste time in the store, and they do not want to sell to you!<//text>< pictures>

Real nice place to shop around. Kinda of hang out if they host fashion shows and if there was more good deals. Cool place to meet people if you are people orient of a out going people person or just watch people. Or see women in leather work there as of there style at times. But they do have nice stuff of dress taste and style for men and women. I like to see a 80% off deals or 100% off deals on clothes and shoes there soon.<//Text>

<text>Nordstrom's store occupies the top levels of this mall which you traverse through escalators that spiral up each level. As you continue up it is an impressive sight looking down below as you continue your ascend to the top. The merchandise is of higher quality expected at the prices that are charged here but clerks are friendly and available for all your questions. It is fun to window shop here and picking up a few nice shirts and pants.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Extremely professional. Above and beyond customer service, attention to detail and comfort is unmatched. This was my fourth appointment for their morracian oil pedicure, eyebrow touch up and manicure. All of my services were one-on-one, with relaxing music and serene atmosphere. Excellent treat for  a gift, wedding, birthday or JUST BECAUSE...you deserve it. Highly recommended.<//Review>

Still holding on in an era of online shopping, this ages-old establishment  still hires some of the most wonderfully strange characters I've ever met. This is where to go when you want to take someone out for a shopping trip, and not just mail them something.< /Review>

I ordered a pair of sunglasses online for pick-up. I received my email notification that the order was ready. I went to the Online Orders counter, the employee asked me for my last name. She searched and searched and nothing (I’m assuming she misspelled my last name).

So, she finally asks me for my order number which I provide for her. She writes it down on a piece of paper (vs looking it up in the computer?) and goes the online orders rack. She looks for about 5 minutes and tells me the order isn’t there. So, I showed her the confirmation email, my order, etc. she puts the piece of paper aside, takes another customer and tells me that “he’s going to go look for your order”. I don’t know who “he” is, but okay.

At this point, I’d gone to the restroom, I read news on my phone, I scrolled through Instagram, etc. 15 minutes or so have passed. No one is at the counter. “He” hasn’t magically returned with my lost order. So, I stand at the counter, hoping someone will notice me. A guy comes out. I tell him what happened. He too writes my order # down on a piece of paper and then looks up the order in the computer, and says: “We have more downstairs. Let me just go get you a new pair.” So, he goes downstairs. He says he’ll be right back. I sit down, read more news, search Google for a place to get a drink.

10 minutes or so later, the original employee is back at the counter. She asked me what I was still doing there. I told her I was left there - this magical “he” and this other guy never came back with my order. She looked like she felt bad, went back to rack where they store the online orders, and voila - there was my order. It was there all along. She looked embarrassed and claimed it was labeled wrong.

I waited 30+ minutes for an order that was always there, right behind them - 5 ft away from them. There weren’t that many orders on the racks. Even if the bag had been mislabeled, she could’ve peeked in the bags. It was a pair of sunglasses - it’s not going to difficult to see them, all by themselves, in one bag.

I never found out who this magical “he” person was. The other guy never came back up with the other pair he was supposedly going to get downstairs. And, once the original employee handed me the sunglasses that had been there all along, they had fingerprints and smudges all over them. They looked like someone who had just eaten butter toast had touched them. Nordstrom - clean the sunglasses before handing them to customers. C’mon.

Extremely frustrating experience. It would’ve been faster to have just gone to the store and bought the sunglasses myself. The whole idea of online ordering is for it to be convenient and quick - which this was not.<//Text>

<Text>I love shopping here. The juniors department is my go to spot. It always carries the newest trends and is especially great for jackets in the fall/winter. I also love browsing the home good section. It's small but has a surprisingly amount of cute stuff which is pretty reasonably priced.

If you have time try to eat at the cafe. Their salads and sandwiches are pretty good.< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Their staffs are usually friendly, and Nordstrom has the best return and exchange policy.

<user_id>113535751125578955305<//user_id><Review>It just seems as though they don't go out of their way to help people of color. I think maybe they're under the impression that we don't have the money they're interested in making a commission on or maybe we're not serious but I changed their mind when I cashed them out and bought out the store. You may say you never know a rich heart can be hiding behind a poor coat. I would suggest Nordstrom's step down off their high horse and realize we're all just people and you never know who's got it and who doesn't but we all should be treated equally whether I spend $5 or I spend 5000. Needless to say I won't be patronizing Nordstrom's in the near future. It was a sobering experience in 2019.</Review>< Pics>

I just love Nordstrom, and especially the Nordstrom in downtown San Francisco.  It's five stories of heaven!  A one-stop shop for all your clothing and cosmetic needs.

One of my favorite parts about this location in particular is that they have a full cafe with a liquor license so they can make some amazing drinks to go with your meal.  My favorite is the blueberry fusion.  The Nordstrom Cafe is a great place to go whether you're looking for lunch or dinner.  Their menu is surprisingly good given that their primary focus is clothing.  They're always good about having sports on their TVs so it's a great escape for the not-so-into-shopping husband, too.

Nordstrom SF also has a spa with some amazing services including massages, facials, and lash extensions.  I prefer the Nordstrom Spa over most more well-known spas because it's much more intimate.<//review>

<text>I like this place, not only Nordstrom, but Westfield and bloomingdales malls. They all are at Market street of San Francisco and if you like some shopping it's good to come here cause of big chose of goods and prices. It's not like Saks-everything expensive, or Ross-chip. I like it for difference</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80858085e669cca1:0xd929252f6c42706e<//GmapID></record>

If you're looking for a really lovely experience getting a suit that matches your needs, aesthetics, tailored; alongside good conversations, tips and advice, find Zee Roa and ask for help!< /review>

Recently I had a wardrobe malfunction and was near Westfield Mall.  Thank goodness for Nordstrom!  You get what you pay for and I knew Nordstrom would have a decent pair of quality pants for a decent price.  I had a professional photo shoot that day, so I needed some pants that wasn't having issues.  I explained what happened to the salesperson and she let me wear the pants out the store and even cut the tags off for me.  She told me to hold onto the tags and return the pants if I had to.  They were a decent price so I kept them ($70ish).  These pants look like they will last for years.  I have some clothing items that have lasted for 5+ years with normal wear, these are those types of pants.

I would have given this store five stars, but the undercover security cop followed me to the women's section.  He was not inconspicuous at all.  (If you're going to follow someone, don't follow them and look obvious doing it, especially if they didn't do anything wrong other than "shopping while being black".  I went to the info desk a couple of floors up, he followed me there and they directed me where to go, and then he followed me to the women's section.  Normally I would have been insulted and left, but I needed some pants and I liked the salesperson, who was African American, which saved this sale.)<//text>

<Text>Nordstrom is well known for shoes and service. But I've noticed a slip in available inventory and a lackluster finish to their poised professionalism.  Gone are the days of proactive greeting  and closing a sale by walking from behind the counter to thank the customer while handing over their bag of purchases. The staff these days diminishes one's shopping pleasure. Thank you for trhe opportunity t ok comment.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1542028380431, 'text': "We're sorry to have let you down, Collette.

The service here is amazing! They don't necessarily always have something I want, but when I go it is never crowded, aside from the half yearly sale. Actually when I first did that I signed up to have someone help me out and that was awesome. They gave me advice and picked stuff out. Their policies are great too. I haven't shopped at many other Norstrom locations so don't know if they are all this nice, but the downtown SF Nordstrom is awesome.<//text>

The bra fitting service lets you stay in a waiting room while someone helps you select suitable bras. This is helpful if you get overwhelmed when shopping normally.<//review>

Last week I purchased a $600 gift card at this Nordstrom location with money I had received at my graduation party. I returned to the same location a couple days later to buy a pair of sandals. When I went to check out the girl told me that the gift card had a balance of $6. I told her that it was impossible because this was my first time using it. She asked me if I had the receipt, however I could not find it in my purse. Then when we checked the activity history she told me that only $6 had been put on the card when it was activated. A manager was called over and once again I was asked about the receipt.  Since I knew it wasn't in my bag I told them that I would go to my car to check. When I returned the manager looked annoyed and when I told her I still couldn't find it she told me without one she wouldn't be able to help. I pointed out that a receipt was pointless proof that I had handed one of the employees $600 and not $6 since obviously the cashier had been careless enough not to put the right number into the computer. She just kept going on about proof of purchase until I asked about the security cameras. At this point she was basically trying to push me out the store. I actually had to offer my name and number and beg them to check the cameras, she took it down and told me someone would get in touch with me once they had done an investigation. I could feel all the employees gathering and whispering about me as I walked away. I definitely feel that from the very beginning I was not believed and therefore no effort was put into helping me get my $594 back. I am heart broken I lost all this money which was gifted to me and will definitely regret choosing to spend my money at this store. I am still waiting now a week later for a phone call, and dread having to go back there even if it will be to collect my money they misplaced.</Review>

< review>
I got something for my sister and came to visit her to different state. The size was wrong, so we
decided to return it and get something else. I left the receipt in my city and my husband took a
picture of it and sent it to me. We were in shock of what happened when we told a sales
person Kathleen Santa Ana that we have a picture of the receip.she got so angry, started
to yell at us and said that shewill call a security if we won’t leave right now. What? Is it
normal to behave like this? Maybe I just don’t understand something. Sales
associates need to be nice and helpful, so people want to come back to the store.
My advice to everybody please avoid this store Nordstrom  and especially crazy Kathleen</review>

<review>It's beautiful. Fine stores and boutiques. Lovely food court. Nordstrom's is the ish! Sometimes wine and cheese and piano jazz as you ascend the central escalator. In SF shopping malls expand up rather than out. Small densely packed city, quite money- cultural. Ooops - multicultural. -- mostly Asian and Hispanic.  Talk about your crazy, rich Asians. Super nice if you have money to spend. Dont even bother looking for how the other half lives. They live in tent cities! Anyway, bring cash. Otherwise, you'd better have friendly relatives.< /review>< gmapID>

< Review>
Came here after trying MAC and Sephora for a full make-up application. The lady at the MAC counter was super helpful in trying to get me and my two friends in - even if it was at a different counter. We came across Smashbox and got help by the lovely Amy. She's seriously spectacular! Hands down the best experience I could have hoped for. She was friendly, and chatty - and flat out magic with her brushes. I'd go back to her time and again.</Review>

Shoe-a-holics, beware!!! The show department in Nordstrom, that I coincidentally stumbled upon, while visiting friends in the area of San Francisco, made my go mental. Then, I understood that this is a chain of department stores all throughout the states and felt a bit envious about it. The customer service is at a very high level and you really feel how the shop assistants are ready to do anything to help you out! I loved it and hope to get back soon!</text>

<Text>Every time I go to this location I always regret it coming out. The selection is average, but the frustrating part is check out. I've always had a negative experience waiting in line for extended periods of time even if there is a short queue. I went there last week and tried checking out at an "express" station but was stuck behind someone making returns (which is not allowed). Upon my turn, they said I could not pay with Nordstrom Notes and told me to stand in the regular line. I never had an issue using notes at an express line at any other Nordstrom Rack store. The employees at the store need to be trained better. They are not at par with the Nordstrom customer service I'm used to.</Text><Response>{'time': 1516647113396, 'text': "We're very sorry to hear about your experiences at our Rack store.

We were at the store looking for a fancy dress for a wedding. Diana, one of the employees helped us and she was very nice and amiable. My mom found a dress she liked but the dress needed some fixing where the boost area is. Diana took my mom to see Fara and when my mom tried to explain what she thought the problem was, the tailor lady literally slapped my moms hand pushing it down and in a very rude voice said that my mom was wrong and started to explain what she though the problem was. She then turned around and ignored my mom. My mom went to change from the dress and when we came out I went to ask Fara something and she completely ignored me, she was with the back towards us. I called a few times but no response.My mom ended up buying the dress but I don't think it's right for Nordstrom to hire people who treat customers like crap! Disappointed!< /Text>< name>

They had a sale going on for the winter time and I decided to go with my mom to pick out some new jeans and sweaters. When I arrived I tried to find some help but could not find a single employee that was not too busy to help me out.

I finally found a lady that wasn’t busy so I asked her to assist my mom and I in finding the right pair of jeans. First of all she seemed like she did not care about what we (the customers) wanted and made me feel like I was bugging her the whole time!

Her choices were careless and she treated us with no respect whatsoever. She left us undecided in the middle of searching and she was nowhere to be found after that. 10 minutes later we saw her helping out some other customer.</text>

If you're a guy looking for some shopping help at Nordstrom, ask for Chris Mondt in men's sport wear. He is simply amazing - has great taste and endless patience for clientele. We recently purchased a wedding outfit for my fiancé with his help.  He really listened to what we were looking for and then provided us with lots of creative options. As we tried everything on and struggled to make up our minds, he patiently listened and offered advice until we found something that we were 100% happy with. We couldn't have done it without him.

Thanks, Chris!<//review>

<Date>1483174005235</Date><Review>My experience was not the best shopping in the men's shoes department. This one employee came upto me and was acting very judgmental and snappy. I asked him if they had a certain shoe in a size and he snapped back and rudly said "no, only in size 11". Luckily another woman helped me a few minutes later and was extremely generious and courteous.<//Review>< Name>

<Text>I personally don't shop at Nordstroms very often, but when I'm in San Francisco I always end up shopping and I usually end up here. To me it's one of the nicer locations. It's in a very busy mall with its own elevators to get to the main sections which also have their own escalators, albeit strange curved wrap around kind. A novelty. The mens section which is always just about half of 1 level is well stocked with quality clothing. I usually just pick up accent pieces to complete things rather than stock up on basics due to price. For some reason I like buying dress shoes here and button up shirts. I generally feel they cater to a more fashionable men's crowd and don't try to be too hip. No skinny jeans here people. I get my collar stays here because they are brass, certain accessories every man should have as well. I actually just pick up 1 or two items here and not shop shop.

It's clean the staff is friendly and helpful. I feel like down in hometown of San Diego they care more about their flip flops and aren't about the good shoes (kicks don't count). I'm not a shoe guy either, but when you have a nice pair of shoes outlast a dozen cheaper pairs it's nice.

Usually the café's in Nordstrom's are very good, not amazing, but good. I kind of expected more from them, but that I'll save for a separate review. Clean bathrooms, but mostly tourists come in to use the child changing tables and the facilities because they are much nicer than most around.

Price is high, even for the city and other Nordstroms around. They have great lighting and minimal decorations. Staff is not just a bunch of people working there for the discounts either.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80858085e669cca1:0xd929252f6c42706e</gmap_id><username>Walter Macalma< /username>< Pics>

It's alright. I think most of the clothes are probably for 10 year olds and 50 year olds but either way, it was a really nice looking place and an employee stopped me from entering into a janitorial closet while I was lost.<//Review>

I like browsing at nordstrom, but today while looking for a product at their chanel stand i felt the staff they had there wasn't as good, he didn't recommend me anything else or help me much with my selection of the lipstick i was looking for, their products are amazing yes, but i wish they were more helpful.<//review>

<text>I would give Lily (in cosmetics a 5 star review). The pick up counter is not attended. Why? Don’t they expect people who choose that option to get their order in store?
I was standing for 10 minutes waiting. I even asked a staff member who was doing the courtesy wrap “Is there anyone tending this pick up desk?” No one came. I asked a Tom Ford counter staff member. He was kind enough to ask again the same wrap staff member. Then Lily showed up and asked me if I had been helped. She got me my item that I ordered wrapped lickety split. Thank you,Lily. Maybe the Nordstrom does not have enough staff if the one assigned to this pick up desk if off helping another guest. A second or third back up in the department is needed for sure. Never leave a section without attendance. That’s like having a ship without someone at the helm. You sink when that happens. For sure my expectation of Nordstrom in-store customer service has today!...except for Lily (!).</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80858085e669cca1:0xd929252f6c42706e<//Gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) It is a very nice store, brand names, elegant and expensive. I think it is inaccessible for some people, but if you want something special and fine that store has many elegant things.

<review>(Translated by Google) I came here twice. The first time I was received by an African female salesperson with a very bad attitude. The second time, a handsome white male salesperson and a Hispanic female salesperson saw me, and I waved them, female Seeing me, they talked to the guy, the guy was shaking his head, and they ignored me at all. I stood at the makeup counter for a long time, no one paid any attention to me, so I had to walk over and ask an Asian salesperson before someone finally took care of me! There were not many customers that day, and there was not a customer at the counter where I stood. When you walked in, no one came over and asked what you wanted. I don’t know if I dress too casually. Or I am Asian.

I came here twice. The first time was an African female salesman who received me. The attitude was very bad. The second time, a white handsome male salesman, and a Hispanic female salesman saw me, I rang them beckoning, female. When I saw me, I talked to the man. The man was shaking his head, and then they ignored me. I stood there for a long time at the make-up counter. No one cares about me. I had to go over and ask an Asian salesman to finally take care of me! There weren't many customers on that day. There wasn't a guest at the counter on my station. When you walked in, no one came over and asked what you wanted. I don' t know if I dress too casually. Or I am Asian.

来了两次， 第一次是一个非洲女销售员接待我，态度很不好，第二次，一个白人帅哥男销售员，和一个西裔的女销售员看见我，我响他们招手，女的看见我，就跟男的说话，男的在摇头，然后他们一点都不理我。我在化妆柜台那边站了好久，没人理我，我只好走过去问一个亚洲的销售员才终于有人理我了！那天没有很多顾客，我站的柜台没有一个客人，当你走进去没有一个人过来问你想要什么。不知道是不是我穿得太随便。还是我是亚洲人。
