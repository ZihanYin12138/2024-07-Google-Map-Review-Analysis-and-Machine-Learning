I know many women won't go to a chain hair salon, but believe me, these ladies are as experienced as those at a pricey alternative.  My fine hair is the bain of my existence.  I used to spent a lot of money at Aveda and other high end stylists, the results were not any better, just more expensive.  Give them a chance!<//text>

<text>Always friendly, good cut for the money. Only issue has to do with wait times, usually way longer than they quote online. The problem is walk ins. Plus they seem to be short staff at times. But overall decent cuts by nice staff, super clean and covid careful.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

It’s been years since I’ve gotten a hair cut from this place and I remember why now.  Prior to getting a haircut they asked me for my cell number.  I told them I wasn’t giving them my phone number.  There is absolutely no reason they need my cell number for a haircut unless they want to sell my personal information.  That’s not safe and I refused to give them my info and in return they said I couldn’t get a haircut.  Horrible business practice but again it’s Great Clips.  Better off getting a better haircut from a better Barber shop and not having my personal info shared.   If I could give them negative stars I would.< /Review>

OK if you want a cheap generic haircut.
Asked to leave length on top, but it was cut short. Beard was trimmed when not asked, after the first quick trim, it was too late to say anything. Lots of long hairs left around my ears.

I won't be returning.<//Review>

I like coming here. You can check in online and save your place in line without having to be there. The stylists are all experienced in many types of hair cutting. You can usually get in and out of there in about 15 minutes or so.< /text>

<Review>Always do online check in, otherwise there can be a lengthy wait. But if you have to wait, it's in a great location to get other errands done while you're waiting. The people who work there have always been really nice to my son and I, and we've been happy with the haircuts.

I 'signed in' online and was informed there was a 15 minute wait. When I arrived there, there was ONE hair person and 4 customers. I no longer believe their time estimates. And, signing in does not put me ahead of persons already in the establishment. I don't know why they offer this feature .......</text>

The Great Clips on Linda Mar receives my lowest 1-star rating of all time and of all places. All the other Great Clips locations that I’ve patroned have been good experiences. However, this place consistently hires socially inept, contentious employees - they must be local “patheticans”, was the term a native pacifican once shared with me. Go here only if you must for convenience.<//review>

We stopped there on the way through town and loved the food. The shrimp tacos I thought were a little expensive but the were some of the best I have tasted. I had a carnitas burrito too and it was awesome and worth the price. If I had a negative thing to say it would be that the store needs to improve its atm/ credit card machine as it worked on the same phone they used for store business and I had to wait for a person on the phone placing an order and still afterwards their machine would not accept the card.< /Text>

<text>Converted auto body shop turned into one of the hottest ticket in town. Hip, airy, buzzing, urban vibe with great views over Divisadero.

Able to get seats right away at 6pm on Friday at the bar. Had to wait a bit for drinks and food but everything was good if not mind-blowing. Bartender wisely suggested half orders of pasta when we (2 of us) tried to order salad, 2 pastas AND pizza 🐷

Pizza thicker/more doughy and a lot smaller than Ragazza/Gialina. So maybe not the best value but overall fun (but pricey) experience.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4QBmCQFInJrInk6MR-jVV8nkBymzHoqMj2F4m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAgGJkqDGkPsWcKJF3J_92GJAwSZVh_vHCsW1K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhbKwSYsgeUNhto4qX4Bw8TJisHFcNf3LXTeVd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjs2uPTdeFot3TskkK-AOR49z3wNDJyXtcdPW-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeX0LbkZsNZcHllnM_7ppSRLfTC_d-LZpbRwp0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80858158edafd663:0x3e5ff98d17c0e8dd<//gmapID></record>

<review>Yes. The answer is yes. The cooking is perfection. The flavors are so well balanced, fresh and present. Had a lovely meal and can’t wait to return again.< /review>< pictures>

Very Good food. Pineapple pizza, Cacio e pee and focaccia bread was very good. It was a bit cold, the heat lamps weren't giving off that much heat, but the food was delicious< /review>

Made a reservation for dinner on a Friday that Monday. Was going to chance a walk in upstairs at che fico but was told by hostess to keep our reservation downstairs. Boy were we glad we did. Food was amazing. Fig bruschetta, charcuterie mix, buccatini (hmmm....) and suckling pig for two. Wine could have use some improvement. But that food...  🤤🤤🤤 So glad we kept our visit. Looking forward to returning again.

Omg. Their strachiatella was soooooo DEvine. Eggplant parmesan was a perfect mix of marinara and breaded crunch. Wine was a bit lacking again this time. But all in all another great dining experience.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I've been here a few times and Che Fico, their upstairs incredibly popular sister(?) restaurant, and i love the atmosphere at Alimentari.  It's a cozy, cool italian spot with such tasty cacio e pepe (highly recommend).  Plus this is easier to get into :) I haven't been lately but saw they have a parklet for outdoor seating on Divis and am excited to head back once outdoor dining is reopen!< /Review>< pics>

as far as Italian restaurants in the US go, this is one of the best i’ve been to if you’re not looking for 100% nonna’s kitchen authenticity. the ingredients are extremely fresh, flavorful, and high-quality, and the dishes offer a California farmer’s market twist on classical Italian traditions.<//text>

I'd recommend trying the melon - salumi appetizer as it looked really good. We started off with the pancetta (photo) which was good too but a little monotonous. Would recommend.<//Review>< pictures>

Not worth the hype. Terrible service. It probably took us 20min to order some wine - which we ended up grabbing another waitress to help us. After our apps, they cleared out plates, and we waited another 15min for our one main that we we're splitting. It ended up being two and a half hours when we ordered five or six dishes total for three people. The food was decent but not worth it. We all decided we wouldn't go back.< /Review>

Solid pasta. Long wait. Don’t get the calamari unless you’re looking for a bowl of pees with a sprinkle of squid. They should take it off the menu. Great wine selection.< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I would say it is a 4.5. I actually prefer this one over Che Fico.
Favorite dishes were the rigatoni amatriciana and suppli al telefono and the eggplant parmagiana.

I'm not a big fan of pecorino so didn't love the cacio pepe, however my friends who do like pecorino said its one of the best cacio pepe they've had! So if you like pecorino definitely get that.

The Spaghetti ragu alla Napoleatana has a strong anchovy and olive taste so its quite salty. Pretty good but not my top choice.

It's hard to get a reservation here, we always try to get it exactly when it opens up at 12am 60 days before.< /Text>< Pics>

Meat, cheese, and wine- what's not to love. Fine quality ingredients and the staff made good recommendations for wine to compliment our dishes. Very tasty. Do make reservations.</Review>

< Review>
Great concept of a limited menu of really well-executed simple dishes. Had mozzarella, prosciutto, and focaccia to start which was an excellent combination and the charcuterie portion was generous. Then pasta (bucatini and rigatoni) which were both perfect. Love that they have wine by the quartino/carafe as well. Only things that detracted from the experience were the cramped shoulder-to-shoulder seating at two-tops and how loud the place is inside.<//Review>

This place has amazing country apparel and it’s high quality but one thing I don’t like is the customer service when I send money. The woman who attended me seemed irritable off the bat and when I told her the name for the person receiving was incorrect she seemed annoyed and just gave me attitude. I won’t describe how she looked but I hope she takes this review under consideration.<//Text>

This store has a little of everything. They are busy on the weekends; however, when you ask any of the employees for help they are all willing to help, if they don’t see you then approach them and they are happy to help. I have been coming for year to use their wiring money services and to buy jewelry. Highly recommend this place.< /review>

(Translated by Google) I want to say that this jewelry is very good, I recommend it because I buy 2 gold bracelets and they did not fit my wife and my daughter and I returned them the next day and they returned the money and well, the very kind attention 👌🏻👍 I will hope to save more money to buy bigger ones

<review>(Translated by Google) THIS PLACE JUST STEALS THE MONEY FROM PEOPLE (DO NOT BUY GOLD HERE) WHY?
1. DON'T WEAR IT. You don't know if you buy weights and beat what it is.
2.TE TAXIS CHARGED eh hido to other Mexican jewelers and if you pay in cash they do not charge you taxis.
3. THE SERVICE IS LOUD The man created the owner has a bad attitude.

(Original)
ESTE LUGAR SOLO LES ROBA EL DINERO A LA GENTE (NO COMPREN ORO AQUI) POR QUE?
1. NO TE LO PESAN no sabes si lo que comprás pesas y bale lo que es.
2.TE COBRAN TAXIS eh hido a otras joyerías Mexicanas y si pagas en efectivo no te cobran taxis.
3.EL SERVICIO ES PÉSIMO el señor creó el dueño tiene una actitud pésima.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Very bad treatment of the workers and of the owner Maria too, they are very arrogant and with no education! As if when you go there they give you things! Or send money with your money! Not knowing that with what people contribute and buy there is, they have to eat! I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!!! There are better places and with more humble and simple staff!

Freddie & Sons is a cool spot to get your tires replaced or taken care of. Our family will take trailers, tow trucks and toys to get them taken care of. Great prices and quick work! - Toy Hauler</Review>

This is the BEST SHOP ANYWHERE! Called on a Saturday morning and had GREAT tires installed for my truck within an hour. $300 less than Firestone (who pulled a bait and switch)! Friendly, professional and fair. Will be coming here for all my tire needs for all of my vehicles.< /review>

They are always very helpful and friendly. They are very reasonable with their prices. Whenever I have any tire issues I go to them. They are on my street just a little ways up. Great family owned and operated company.< /text>

Freddie is a great guy. I have been using him for 8 yrs now on all my company vehicles.  Great prices and fast service. Quality work always. Has a ton of used tires for a quick fix. Thanks Freddie!!</Review>

They have tires for ATVs, cars, pick up trucks, and big rigs. I bring all my vehicles here, including my 18 wheeler. I bet if I had a bicycle they'd hook me up! They also speak Spanish, so that's a plus for the Latino community. The only thing missing is the shop wiener dog that died a few years ago.

This is the worst place ever so are Tire got punctured on the freeway so we decided to stop there due to it was the closest place to the freeway when we got there nobody greeted us they were sitting down looking at their phones when we asked them if they could attend us they said they were on lunch break and that they would not be able to attend us right now and we could wait there if we wanted to we told them we would and sat there as we watch them finally we just got tired and we went up to them and ask them how many minutes more it would be before they could attend they said 25 to 30 minutes I have never heard of I have a tire shop doing this in my entire life I’m pretty sure the owner wasn’t there because I don’t think we would’ve been treated like that!!!!< /review>

Typical sleazy business man, quoted me $600 for two tires out the door price. Come time to pay he ups it to $690. Job got done and done well but not happy being lied to and the price is a bit steep for such budget tires. Service was done on a commercial truck to keep things in perspective.</Text>

<Review>Great place to hike or climb; Trails and routes for beginners and veteran hikers and climbers. Its a beautiful place but its usually packed on weekends and holidays. Parking can be frustrating and the gates close at 5pm so keep that in mind if you're planning a day trip.< /Review>< pictures>

If you are just looking to get lost in nature and learn while you are at it, the trails have interesting learning facts strategically  placed for viewing.   There is also a unicorn of a waterfall that flows for a few days after a heavy rain then  magically😉 disappears again.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Classic climbing in San Diego.  A.k.a. "the grunge" one can expect to find footwork difficult to get at first.  But if you can learn to smear at rhe gorge, then your gonna be able to smear anywhere.  I recommend doing Suzies Wild Ride, Hangmans Climb, Escapade, Quantum Leap, Dark Rider and General Dynamics.  For those looking for a real challenge there is the Thumb, I wish you luck on that beast!</Review>

Salesperson name Maria was handling my request of purchase....... my issue was that the truck i was interested in was being sold while she was running my credit and I literally ask how was everything going and she said she's waiting for other banks to get back at her, so the following day I called her back for a follow up and they told me she's busy and will give me a call back.... couple hours pass another Salesperson called and inform me that the truck have been sold to another person and if I was interested in another truck.... I told her why didn't they just told me that the truck was sold already now I have wasted my time and my credits was affected by running them..... not a good experience at all with this dealer.</Text>

<Review>Great service, friendly, and great prices. The process of buying my car was easy and they explained everything very well. I feel satisfied with my purchase. Definitely would recommend.

Since the day I bought it, they had told me about a problem with the car (I was told after all the paperwork was done) ,but to be fair I didn’t test drive the car so I can’t blame it all on them. They told me they were going to fix it in 2 weeks which turned out to be almost 7 weeks because I barely got it fixed yesterday. I was expecting a new part, but the part that they put in is used. This morning I got into my car and tried to start it and it just wouldn’t start. After a while of trying it finally started. Then, I drove it to the first stop sign and once I stopped, there was a really loud rattling sound.<//Review>< pics>

Bought a 08 suburband from them. When we got there it was in the back and the battery was dead, which was no big deal the replaced it before we left. Few days later wife was driving down the road and the truck turned off causing her almost to crash. We had it towed to our house where I found the ground cable was complete broken due to them not putting the battery bracket back on the battery and the battery was sliding around under the hood. I told them that I could fix it for about a hundred dollars and I would do it myself since it was at my house, I am an ASE certified tech and I need the truck. I only wanted them to pay for the parts. They told no and that they would only pay for half or they wanted us to tow it to their shop they contract with. The truck was also missing a lot of things and we were not worried about it till this almost killed my wife. I don't not recommend  this dealership. Stay away.

Update: they also charged us license and registration and we got a notice from the DMV to pay 2018. When we asked they tried to tell us that's how they do it and when we told them I worked at dealership and know we paid for them they refunded us the funds. DON'T BUY FROM THEM THEY STEAL!!!!!<//text>

<review>Sad to say how truly people like this car dealer can and will take advantage of nice decent people as myself. I genuinely gave my 3000 dollar down pay with no amount whatsoever given back . After the fact of getting two cars. First one had only three days motor went out. Then yes they took advantage again to place us in another car asking for more money down . That car broke too. Here I am with a six month old son and still without a car and no type of refund at a loss of my money down to end up with no transportation. In all fairness sad that this world has the crookedness I’ve experienced by coming to this dealer . Esquivel is about taking and not looking out for any type of customers period. In time hopefully Justice is served. Highly recommended to not think their cool .< /review>< rate>

Last year we went to purchase a Chrysler Aspen and I love it, there were no problems and we left with it that day and I still have it. We just went back a second time to purchase a Chrysler 300 and again very impressed and happy. We worked with Junior and Pearl. They were terrific and took care of us. I highly recommend to any one! Will will be returning again in the future!< /Text>

<text>Just bought a used car from this Latino family owned place about a week ago and for the price, it was reasonable and worth it! Common sense, always know what to look out for if you decide to buy used. Saleswoman Maria sold me the car and she listened to me with whatever questions and concerns I had. She was very professional once I was ready to sign and also helpful with whatever I needed to know prior to signing. Overall, Maria made my experience pleasant throughout everything and I am happy with my purchase. I will recommend anyone that is looking for a car to see Maria! Thank you Maria!!!!< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c34d732dba2737:0x3c2de20d897bde49<//Gmap_id></record>

DO NOT!
i repeat do not do service with this dealer.
A family member of mine has been taken advantage by this company
In the past month she was given 2 vehicles
In which the first vehicle within 3 days the motor was totally shot .
It then took this company some pleading to get another vehicle to her . yet again after reaching out to them multiple times and being avoided she was given another vehicle which of course broke down 2 days later.
So now upon trying to reach them again regarding the issue they have clearly not helped or responded in anyway
She was even trying to just get the down payment back of $3,000 and they are totally ignoring her
To make matters worse she has a new born child and in dire need of a vehicle or at least the funds from the deposit back.
Terrible service from a terrible company
Please fair warning to all do not do business with them.< /Text>

Easy financing but horrible cars make sure you inspect ever part of the car before buy forsure under the hood and there cars are always over priced i had bought a car from here and had a weird popping noise by the front wheels and they told me because i had cut springs but i found out i dont have cut springs and it was my lower control arm was bad so my warranty was up already so they said they couldnt do anything about it< /Review>

The truth is you can buy a car in almost every corner. What you should look for Is service. Esquivel Auto depot has great service. They are not pushy like other car lots. They truly helped me and my family out with getting into a vehicle that would fit my family's needs.

Thank you Esquivel Family for helping us out. I will let everyone know that you provided a great service.</review>

Nice little local dealership. They have a wide variety of vehicles for sale at reasonable prices. Parking is a bit tricky and the majority of the staff only speak Spanish.< /Review>

I was kind of skeptical on going with a used dealership for my brother but my friend recommended Esquivel Auto he advised me he purchased both his cars a Mercedes and a BMW with no issues and they even gave him warranty, his a trusted friend so I met with Marcos alongside my brother we finally found what my brother was looking for and as of now no issues fast, easy services and great car SELECTION. We were in and out in an hour. GREAT JOB EVERYONE! TRUSTED SERVICE</text>

They rushed my boyfriend to get a car and didn’t even explain to him all the forms 4 days later he said he didnt want the truck anymore so the so called manager (the lady in the far left desk) told bring me my car and hung up in his face a. Total of 4 times while he tried to get and understanding of why he couldn’t get his down payment back After just 4 DAYS. These people are rude and don’t care about there customers at all and treat you as if you didn’t just give them your money DO NOT GO HERE< /text>

I came in with no hope in getting a car, my credit was not that great! As soon as i walked in i seen a car i fell in love with! And i was able to drive out of there with the exact car i wanted! Marcos and the whole Esquivel team were great! They were the friendliest people ive ever met! They made me feel so welcomed and they didnt try to pressure me or anything like any other dealer would of! I highly recommend them! They also worked with me and they made my payments comfortable and affordable to the point were i wont be stressed out and fall behind. Thank you all! You guys were awesome!!< /Review>

<review>Super bad dealership. Worst ever. Bought a car from the a few month so ago. It was dirty from the exterior to the interior. The lights didn't work. The battery didn't work. Super dirty car. They only gave us one key, they claim that they don't have the spare even though we saw it on the test drive. Inside the building smelled like rotten egg. A horrible smell. They were changing a baby's diper in there. It just added to the smell. All of there cars are overpriced & aren't even in good condition. Bad experience. They also practically kicked us out after signing the papers & all that.< /review><rate>1</rate><userid>116827607774932605452</userid><GmapID>0x80c34d732dba2737:0x3c2de20d897bde49< /GmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Time>1499797507743<//Time>< name>

Worst dealership on earth "DO NOT GO!!!!!". bought a car brought it home three days later broken down they told me they're going to help me out then the next day went to go pick up the car they handed me a bill, few weeks later the car broke down again. I took it to Subaru mechanic shop and with in minutes they had a list of problems any mechanic would of seen if they only looked at the car. I payed out of my own pocket to get it fixed, then when I went to talk to them about all the problems it had they where very rude and didn't want to answer any of the questions I asked them, till this day the car has a ton of problems. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!!!!</Text>

<Review>I went here after going to about 10 other car dealerships and all of them either told me i had too bad of credit and needed a cosigner or $5000 down and wouldn't work with me but as soon as i got to Esquivel and told them my situation they didnt hesitate to help me. I didnt need a cosigner or $5000 down and they gave me time to get my down payment and found me a car I loved for a great price and with awesome customer service! This is the place to go and they had a ton of cars to choose from!</Review>< Rate>

<Text>This place is horrible, the people there come off as nice but take no time to care about you because they're so tied into attending other people that came in after you in hopes to obtain a sale. My pregnant wife and I waited for hours, before our issue was resolved. These people don't care for you or your car after they made their sale. I bought an older vehicle and it was already starting to have issues a week after it came off the lot. they tell you to write in description what the problem with the vehicle is before your 30 day warranty ends. they only fixed one part and thought it was resolved. our car still has issues and our warranty is up. remember, this place is trash. the mechanics can easily remove the check engine light with a diagnostics machine. i'd suggest looking elsewhere because this place is a fraud.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Yet more Racism from this Dealership ! This person tried selling me a Chevy Cruze blue n color but when I started it up & check under the hood to check on a noise I heard & noticed that the engine was shaking , the sales person came out & said the down payment had went from 1500$ to 2300$ on a used car, I was told I had no credit ! Who has no credit ? U have either good or bad credit when I was told your credit didn't matter , your job was your credit ..... When ppl start speaking in another language they think u don't understand 9/10 times they are taking about u & it's not good ...... But once again HISPANICS  playing the race card .... Please don't think I'm saying this because I didn't get that car I didn't want because it would have cost me more in repairs after I drove it off the lot or I would have ended up.in court sueing them under the lemon law . Once again another RACIST Situation & I'd u don't believe RACISM exist ! Try being BLACK</text><user_id>112897957525408946114< /user_id>< time>

This car dealership is the worst ! They where nice at first willing to work with you... But after you sign there is a complete turn around very rude and not helpful at all! Once we drove the car off the lot it broke down they sent me to their so call mechanic that didn't do anything to the car ! Till this day that car is nothing but problems !  They are a rip off !! Regret getting a car here ! And also they showed us a car fax that didn't belong to the car ...we found out when we tried tading it in that it had been in a accident and on their report it showed nothing ... They are a scam should have looked at their bbb rating F!< /text>

Horrible experience  after the purchase sold one of my buddies an expensive vehicle that is  not worth  13000 if you do end up here don't believe everything about the warranty get the car fax and take a mechanic like you should. His car has been in  a run down shop for a month one problem after the other.<//review>

HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'VE KNOWN 5 PPL SO FAR THAT HAVE PURCHASED CARS FROM HERE, AND THEY ARE ALL LEMONS. THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THEN ALL KINDS OF LIGHTS START COMING ON, THE CARS STARTS ACTING FUNNY LIKE ITS ON ITS LAST LEG. THE PPL ARE VERY NICE UNTIL THEY GET YOUR MONEY. THEN THEY GIVE YOU THE RUN AROUND AND ARE VERY RUDE. THE SAID THEY FIXED MY CAR, AND THEY LIED. THEY DIDNT DO ANYTHING TO MY CAR. AND NOW IT COST ALMOST 2,000 TO FIX AND IVE ONLY HAD THE CAR 3WEEKS.</Review>

They sold me a car that only worked until I brought it home and then it broke down. There was so many problems with the car and when I took it to a Subaru mantientance shop there were more problems with the car than I can count. And when I took the car back to esquivel they said it was my problem. And they tried tacking on more money on the down payment then what we never agreed to on the contract. DO NOT GO HERE! They were horrible and will definitely rip you off!!<//Text>

<Review>Im glad this place knows what they are doing!!! Been to another dealer down the street, was promised me theyd approve me and nothing, had too return the car!! I was super upset!! ! Then my friend told me of ESQUIVALS.  I called and told them i had bad credit and what had happend at the other dealer. One of the girls that answered said, if you have income and a downpayment we can help. So i went down to look at the cars and was out in about an hour, long story short. Fast easy process, and got me approved.< /Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) It is very easy to qualify, they are very kind to serve you and the most important thing is that you go out driving the car you choose, it does not matter if you have all the down payment, because they give you favorable time to give it and they give you the car without problem, And very importantly, Ask for BRIAN PICADO And he will help you with pleasure and you will leave driving the car you NEED. 🚐🤗

(Original)
Es muy fácil calificar ,muy amablemente te atienden y lo más importante es que sales manejando el carro que escojes,no importa si tienes todo el down payment, porque te dan tiempo favorable para darlo y te dan el carro sin problema,Y muy importante, Pregunta por  BRIAN PICADO Y te Ayudará con mucho gusto y saldrás manejando el carro que NECESITAS. 🚐🤗</text>

The food is delicious and the owner is beyond nice. It's great to finally have a Colombian restaurant in my hometown. Now when I want empanadas, I don't have to wait for my family to make them during holidays only. They're conveniently a few minutes away from me! ;)< /text>

<gmapID>0x80c2c953d08fa385:0xd183b38fe66f4e67</gmapID><Review>We absolutely loved this place. By far the best most authentic Colombian Food in the LA área. Family run restaurant with a home cooked flavors. I have ate at tons of restaurants in Colombia from Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Cartagena, Barranquilla and Santa Marta and the food here is just a delicious as the food there. Had a family breakfast here and all 8 family members including my 1 year old niece that tried the Ajiaco, plátanos and buñuelos enjoyed the food, even my mother who only likes to eat her in cooking and is super picky loved it. I also can’t say enough about the superb service accommodating a large party that arrived at different times with warm  and fast service. It was my husbands birthday and Gloria came out with cake for all of us and even sang las mañanitas in karaoke - made my husband feel right at home as if he was in Colombia. Will be back often.<//Review><response>None<//response>< rating>

<text>First time trying colombian food. Really good food . Tried the bandeja paisa and my mother ordered the lengua en salsa,  definitely good choices. Waitress might just have to smile a bit more and try suggest things if she notices your having a hard time trying to decide. Food was definitely good thou and made up for that.</text><userid>104223338545128597635< /userid>< Gmap_id>

Glad to have a  Colombian restaurant close to home, no longer need to drive out to La Fonda Antioqueña in E. Hollywood. They provide a good and friendly service to their customers and the food is delicious aswell.<//review>

Great experience. Love the variation of decorations in the restaurant. Plus, there is a mini gift shop at the cashiers, novelty items from Colombia.
The food was delicious at a fair price.</Review>

Great authentic Colombian food, very meaty and savory. They have lots of colombian packaged candy and sodas for sale to take home. The juices are also amazing they have passion fruit, guava, blackberry and more, so good and fresh.  Also the empanadas are so good and crispy not like some other places with soggy ones they make a great side to whatever meal you get. They come in beef , chicken and cheese. When coming just know that everything is made to order so it will take longer than a regular restaurant. Good restaurant not the best I've ever had but better than average. Also the colombiana soda is like a regular coke but with a bubblegum after taste weird but really good.</Text>

Delicious, but took forever to be served, on a weekday afternoon. It may have been due to the kitchen receiving an unforseen wedding-catering request. Your experience may be better. The Bandeja Paisa was delish!< /text>

(Translated by Google) The service is good but the food is really disrespectful to the Colombian community ... the worst fritters I have tasted are in this place, the empanadas far from being good ... and the worst, the paisa tray is served with canned beans. This is an attempt against our culture!

(Original)
La atención es buena pero la comida realmente es una falta de respeto a la comunidad Colombiana...lo peores buñuelos que he probado están en este lugar, las empanadas muy lejos de ser buenas ... y lo peor, la bandeja paisa la sirven con frijoles en lata.

<Review>(Translated by Google) note: 5 stars is to not impact a small business, but my actual thoughts below:

Overcharged me, and they know they did it. I haven't purchased boxed mixes here in California, so when a box of natilla and a box of buñuelos came out to almost $ 15 I was a bit shocked but assumed that was the price around here. Got home and saw one of the boxes had a sticker price of $ 3.99. Dishonest business - will never return and will never recommend it. Stay away.

They overcharged me, knowing the real price of what I had bought. It was my first time shopping for the custard and fritter boxes at home here in California - when my bill came out to almost $ 15 I was shocked but figured that would cost here in Los Angeles. When I got home I noticed a box had a price tag of $ 3.99. They saw me face money and they overcharged me. This is a dishonest business - it was my first and last time there and I will never recommend this restaurant. Better go somewhere else.

Me cobraron de más, sabiendo el precio real de lo que había comprado. Era mi primera vez comprando las cajas para preparar natilla y buñuelos en casa aquí en California - cuando mi cuenta salió a casi 15$ estaba sorprendida pero me imaginé que eso costaba aquí en los angeles. Cuando llegue a casa me di cuenta que una caja tenía una etiqueta con un precio de 3.99$. Me vieron cara de dinero y me cobraron de más. Este es un negocio deshonesto - fue mi primera y última vez allí y nunca recomendaré este restaurante. Mejor vayan a otro sitio.</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very bad experience,
The waitress had a bad attitude, from the moment we arrived.
If you don't know how to deal with people you shouldn't be working there.
We were a group of 13 people all left disappointed and if you want to return, the food had no flavor, the dough they make the empanadas was hard, the donuts looked like we were chewing gum, hard and tasteless pandebonos, from so many restaurants that We have visited this was the most horrible! We had not had such an unpleasant experience.
We went there because we knew the previous owner, but it turns out that she is not the same.

(Original)
Muy mala experiencia,
La mesera, tenía mala actitud, desde el momento en que llegamos.
Si  no sabe lidiar  con gente no debería estar trabajando ahí.
Fuimos un grupo de 13 personas todos salimos desilucionados y si ganas de regresar, la comida no tenia sabor, la masa con que hacen las empanadas estaba dura, los buñuelos parecía que estábamos masticando chicle, los pandebonos duros y sin sabor, de tantos restaurantes que hemos visitado este fue el más horrible! No  habíamos tenido una experiencia tan desagradable.
Fuimos ahí porque conocíamos a la dueña anterior, pero  resulta que ya no es la misma.</Text><resp>{'time': 1565117170397, 'text': '(Translated by Google) I am so sorry for that bad experience on behalf of the owner, I apologize.

(Translated by Google) Very bad service I feel super disappointed, it is the first time I ordered in this restaurant for this near me and one yearned for the food of their country, they sent me an ajiaco that was vinegar 🤮 for those who do not know what vinegar is when its flavor is being damaged it is bitter and sparkling for me it was terrible, I was hungry and what an unpleasant surprise I took, I called for a solution and I had no one in charge

It has very good attention. You can enjoy rich natural juices, meat dishes, chicken, fish. Among my favorite dishes is the paisa tray, the sobrebarriga and the mojarra. The seafood kazuela is also very good. It has empananas and other typical tamales like Tolimenses. Another plus is that they sell some Colombian snacks like chocorramo, cocosettes and malta pony

(Translated by Google) They did not give me any customer service. I asked a cook to make me a piglet, since I know a cook who does it well and ended up hanging up and never answered my calls. The restaurant is good, but the service is horrible 1 star for which you answer the Telefonica pity I do not return anymore

(Original)
No me dieron ningún servicio de atención al cliente. Pedí un cocinero para que me hiciera una lechona, ya que conozco a un cocinero que lo hace bien y terminó por colgarme y nunca contestó mis llamadas. El restaurante es bueno, pero el servicio es horrible 1 estrella para la que contests el Telefonica  lastima no vuelvo ya</Review>

<Text>Like any good Mexican restaurant you get greeted nicely with chips and salsa, very friendly staff and good vibes overall, the place is small and not suitable for parties over 6-7, the menu it's pretty extensive and there's a lot to choose from, I got a "Cemita" and it was really really good!

<Review>I bought the Takis & Hot Cheeto Esquites and i was super disappointed i assumed they were made with the chillie powder like other places but i was wrong they just crumbled up actual chips and put them on top of the corn. I wouldn't recommend them at all.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Service is good. The ladies there are very nice. But, i went for menudo and... My theory is that the menudo is from a can. It had no flavor what so ever. I've had can menudo twice and it was just like it. If it's not... Stop selling it! Even the tacos weren't good. Now i know. But service is good and the place is clean.</Text><user_name>Modesto Garcia< /user_name><rating>1< /rating>< Resp>

< Review>
Great mexican homestyle food. The service is fast and friendly. The agua frescas are amazing. The food reminds me, of the way my abuelita would get down in the kitchen. I had the torta de asada, and my daughter the three tacos and rice and bean on the side, and the agua de sandia. Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu. Would recommend.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>One thing is the structure itself and the layout of the place.i been going ro this place for decades..in my life,i believe it's been 3 different establishments.i have no idea on the history of the owners.I just love the building itself.It's aura,its feeling is calm and safe.it's had that feeling ever since i was a small kid...Now as Rocky's,it's flippin' great.it's comfort food,it's great comfort food.As of late they serve Premium elotes and esquites(premium cause they add the polvo chips on it.(takis/hot Cheetos/Tostitos/Doritos)(the best,in my opinioni, the  Tostito covered elotes taste best.it adds a nice texture without taking any of the elotes flavor.)The just recently included a Good Humour ice cream chest.which means i will visit more..They serve menudo and pozole everyday........Now i want me some Rocky's.........< /Text>< GmapID>

The order a huarache  which is supposed to be a thick tortilla top with beans carne asada lettuce tomatoes  and more.  The taste was ammaising.  But it was not a huarache ( thick  tortilla )  it was a regular tortilla   . I mentioned it to the people over there but all they say  was .you have a nice day . I paid $ 7.70 for a taco not a harache.</Text>

<Review>Awesome crazy wavy black water lake middle of no where which has It's breathtaking beauty. You have to experience the thrill of the waves of this lake surrounding snowy mountains in-person to understand this descriptions 🤔
Good place to camp, fishing, exploring, tracking & more.
This lake is a great example of the beauty of nature by the Great creator. Heaven on Earth.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhLhR98Vc47YxYIM6TqDy_HTuUkoSyif2LGBOM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBLfjSC1hs8PkGVlJ5dLqsOyIkZSJ9ZdbAocAe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvDvo6YJcex86xAigMAFq6hkQd2fUKCk4DGUlu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzaEMr_diUrmfU7PS8QCqm_x53nk4N1q-XdSxo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvRfWe3nycKpTHs5NgNaNNw8SVDFpKaA3ZtJVv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxiy57cCh8OvHjsDyAjhWHnLlT0TthVh5-_WDp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgpmRpoXr-lDZSkpXVUpqBJ-HJbDbgSfV-IEHF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGuUAJH_6y2tTyMOS2Dy6gXkRTka2NBQtd3tXH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAvlsDdRBX5b5zKk9zxlqgwgeKelv5VoJtaCjF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqp2-h4jvCYIrWfnaZYRUUjppfXaTKpFhaIWFx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMKUBqUCHJimcgB3vEFa5Wnx3u73YPSeStFC5M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOar3B54D0EYTQbhC7pfi4p3D9uOH-mWc6cbTxS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwglmY-1vNFgBP48hXVBsXRVoHplWHKiDcevco=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6PbhFdLqDcFj-V8IqI9VqrE8JJRUGwMlgjDOw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxWqFPUdYMsveoODcuA1BuYGol-hvcg1fHSDvL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1el_7xdKJW6WzncKBhzQJ-UmdEoDnJU6WGBJ9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKn4pMq_ksAebcxv3FUHYH268Sp1vEJGSBDyZM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOk1UiKpUcVg3oXFKyuQr6FKhBI050bWx5HOTbT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNGdSQoF9x9kJXq2jPQBrSZ3uyxlCjECdvUAt9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW82N7i46aJtO2HUdQZcD3wfe1Rxak4IZi1_Sd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8Ld2eKxHCmTQWJy9B6rv83Jn36WSAxY3v30QR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCV5Grb_rg33BRCRaWZFD2BQVC5d3Lf5f01rj0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0GtRw9snHx4R44Le6SM574nPGlJ3Y_B6YbjSW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMA82ag4KMjQLW1tqPaTD6k-cULeAyFdmduf9Jv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6TlKv7KPZvoZ5Vkoqrxj5rFRuWOUt_LPB7t4D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHkEJW7DjLTsnlh4gR-3fuIdR7kbhIE8JDLd8n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

<Review>Where do I begin? This place is beautiful.  We went while there was still snow capping the mountains so the views were out of this world.  First, the drive to the lake is beautiful.  The closer you get,  the more scenic it becomes.  Once you get there,  the colors of nature explode.  The lake wasn't just blue,  it was a vibrate turquoise. The air was clean and crisp.  The sound if the lake opening to a stream was peaceful.

We rented a boat and stayed out on the lake for a few hours. The customer service was awesome.  Those guys went above and beyond.  Overall,  I'd highly recommend this lake.</Review>< resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>We visited at early November where entire lake was turned to golden! Fall colors were really beautiful here and good trail in between a fall colors.  There are enough parking places here and no parking charges. Water was very cold in the lake. Clean and beautiful lake with a mountain view makes you the good place for photography.<//Text><pics>[{'url':

The stark mountains and the crystal clear water are breathtaking. Unfortunately you can’t really camp here. You can stay at the resort. I highly recommend renting a boat for the day. The hike around the lake is well worth it! There’s a nice boardwalk at the eastern edge. There’s some nice shade and it’s a good spot to eat lunch. This is a must see landmark if you’re driving up Highway 395. The lake got its name after several Convicts escape from jail and hid in the mountains. There was eventually a shoot out and the sheriff died.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< UserId.>

<review>I was here on October/25/20.
Convict lake is one of the most beautiful and easy to access.
The lake has campground, fishing and hiking trail, all with a stunning backdrop.
It is 2.5 miles hiking loop, not much of elevation gain.
I did not hike around it so I cannot comment on the trail,but I can imagine it is worth to doing it for stunning views.
It is one of the most spectacular fall colors, the best show of glowing golden- orange- crimson fall colors in western United States.
The water as clear as glass and the reflection of mountains surrounding around convict lake are breathtaking as well.
This is the best  place to take beautiful fall colors  pictures.< /review>< Pics>

I visited convict lake in the wrong day. Due to Creek wild fire, the air quality is absolute miserable. AQI is over 300. A smog blanketed the whole area around mammoth lakes. All in all, convict lake is still as beautiful and busy as usual. Tons of visitors ignored the smog and enjoyed their time with the fishing, boating, and photographing.

Convict lake is about 15 minutes driving from mammoth lakes. Mount Morison and Laurel and Bloody Mountains circles around the lake and Aspen trees along the shore shows pretty reflection in the lake. If you ever wonder where all the mountain's name comes from. You shall know the incident happened around this lake over a hundred years ago. On 10/17/1871, 29 convicts broke out of a prison in Carson City. Some of them fled to this area to hide and eventually died at this lake. A shootout occured on that day, a few prisoners were wound and two locals were killed. Since then, Convict Lake got its name from this incident. Mt. Morrison and Mono Jim Peak were named after the two killed locals. Of course, you know why there is a bloody mountain by the lake.

There is an easy 2.5 mile hiking trail loop around the lake. The total elevation is about 180 feets. For the best view, you shall hike around the lake anti-clockwise. You can park either at the convict lake trail head  near fistherman's trail, or at the convict lake marina. Both places have lot of parking slots. There are plenty vista points around the lake, and lake shore is quite easy to access from the trail.<//Text>

Convict Lake is one of the places you must stop when traveling up to the Mammoth Lakes area. It is best to travels during the fall season however the Lake is spectacular during all seasons. People can fish here and take little boats out but it is enough to just walk there and take in the scenery</text>

Amazingly clear, as always. If you're brave enough to bare the cold, there are plenty of places to swim around, and the water is so clear, you can open your eyes and see very well.< /review>

Another easy, and extraordinarily beautiful, spot right off 395. There’s about a 3 mile walk around the lake, but there’s plenty to see and explore without doing the whole loop.< /text>

One of my most favorite places in the Eastside.  The history of the lake is really neat.  There is also a band of rock that is exposed that's millions of years old.< /text>

Beautiful but busy spot. Since the parking is right next to the lake there are a lot of families and groups here. We stopped to take a dip and have our lunch. The water was cold in early September but was a nice dip on a hot day.
The lake is huge and there are plenty of spots to sit at.<//Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Roughly 2 miles up a windy road, off of         Highway 395, lies Convict Lake, named after a band of outlaws who hid out up here, long ago.

At an elevation of 7,850 ft., strenuous hikes around the lake will take your breath away.  When visiting most of these high altitude Sierra lakes, first light is the best time to fish, as well as do photography.  You can catch rainbow trout & brown trout in this regularly stocked lake.  In the early morning hours, when the wind hasn't kicked up yet, you can capture some really nice mirror-like reflection pics of the lake.

Convict Lake resembles a huge bowl.  The barren Sierra peaks act as the sides of the bowl.  You'll see bushes & trees around the lake, but the majority of Convict Lake's surroundings are as sheer & rocky as a Martian landscape.

Last time I was here, in June 2016, I saw 2 young Mule Deer in the parking lot, right after getting out of the car.  They weren't the least bit fearful of me, as they made their way to some nearby bushes, and lazily grazed on vegetation.

I caught one rainbow trout here that time, a nice 2lb. specimen, which I BBQ'd later that day, using lots of butter, salt & pepper, fresh herbs and sliced almonds.  The larger trout are easier to eat than the smaller ones, since the larger trout's bones come out more easily, all in one piece, when the fish is perfectly cooked.

My wife and I saw a Bald Eagle at Convict Lake, first soaring, then perched way up high in a tall Pine tree.

Convict Lake is a fairly good fishing spot, featuring stark, rugged natural beauty.</review>< Pictures>

<time>1550891851426</time><review>We spent a week at the campground in late September 2018. We caught a few trout but overall the action was slow as expected for that time of year. Convict Lake is absolutely beautiful with vistas all along the trail that surrounds the lake.  My son and I explored the general area as well and had a great time! We plan to return with the entire family later this year.<//review>< rate>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>One of the best places to visit in the area! Beautiful pictures can be taken everywhere. We went in early October and the trees were beginning to turn a lovely yellow color.
Several photographers will setup around the shoreline and paths around the lake. I brought my SLR setup as well to take a few couple shots. Several people fishing as well close to the entrance and around the shore there are picnic benches. A couple of boats also in the lake.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUA12DLsOG9ySUwp8c3onLdc4tXqKcIzxK4c-U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGN0bHdrqTWB00pu9-pY9i-kJ9xIfCsS5__E31=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG63e6tIb4Qs-no8D3zBILw2xWIQH13_XEIjXO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcCLfF_uNhaT5aDnzekvNQWO0_3fT5Z410CySF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOt1-rIQcWIZLgDMelSpANHcMmeamK6R_vvin3-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr3PTuPQyWaKMv21PRw8mk-ZU7kjPkZwAHI-bX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

We were driving back home after we spent the day at Mono Lake and we decided to take a quick turn on the famous Convict lake and wow  what a breathe taking moment when we saw it, we were speechless at the beauty of this place. Definitely we will come back to spend more time here.<//Review>

Absolutely beautiful place. The water is crystal clear. If you are brave, go for a swim (it gets better after 20-30 seconds in the water). The fishermen are a little touchy and bossy about "scaring the fish." But the shoreline is full of tangles of fishing line, a danger to all the wildlife that lives there. If you have time, like I did, pick up all the tangles of fishing line that you see and throw it in the garbage cans. The campground sites are small and really close to each other, and $25! I had a neighbor with 2 vehicles (from Florida) that returned to their site at 2am in the morning, and started making a fire, flashing car lights and overall unprepared for a freezing night. I got beautiful photos, but I don't plan on camping here again (would like to try one of the cabins though). Haven't eaten at the restaurants, but my parents did and wouldn't stop raving about how good it was.</text>

<text>One of the many places we visited during our trip to the 2018 mule festival. I'd bet the fishing is pretty good in there as it is in the rest of the Sierra Nevada's. We saw an abundance of wildlife during our hike in the area. A lot of history concerning this lake and the name. It was extremely cold there but the peacefulness and beauty can't be beat.<//text>< Rating>

<Text>It was so windy, but still able to enjoy the place. The picnic area is beautiful looking at the lake. We did not do any hiking because of the snow. The Resort, is also nice, all the cabins look great. Campground was empty, out of season maybe. But it will be a good place for us to stay next time we visit.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Crystal clear (and cold) waters. Some rental boats but otherwise calm and relaxing. There's a public trail all around the lake and spots every 100 feet or so that go down to the water where you can hangout/picnic/etc. Nearby are bathrooms and parking lots as well as campgrounds. Dogs welcome on leash. Show up early (before 10am) if you want the "best" spots and parking. I've seen some people pull some massive trout from this lake right from shore.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<name>Monica Sierra</name><date>1552836286927<//date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>This is one of my favorite places in the world.  This lake is as clear as glass, full of fish and has exceptionally stunning beauty!  All of the lakes in Mammoth are pristine but Convict Lake has amazing beauty.  The water has that turquoise color that comes from the minerals of melting glaciers and it is super clear.  My favorite time there is fall as I LOVE the magnificent colors.  It is great for hiking, fishing, boat rentals are avaliable, there is a restaurant about 3 minutes away from the water, small cabins to rent and horses for rent at certa8n times of the year.  My photos are from fall and my favorites.  I plan to visit every year.< /Review>< pictures>

If you want to enjoy camping and fishing, convict Lake is one the best place. Lake has trail and you can walk around it. It has beautiful view and you can stop in many points and enjoy. I walked around the lake and took these three photos from end of the lake where trees with beautiful leaves located. Also, you can rent boat over there.<//text>

This high altitude lake is stunningly beautiful with mountains surrounding on three sides.  It is a great spot for walking, trail running, and fishing!  The restaurant is great as well for fine dining.</review>

<Text>Great place for family fishing.  Shore fishing is supreme.  If you come early, you can park and walk to premium spots.  Walking around the lake will reward you to bigger trout near the mouth of the lake.  We come here every year, and it never disappoints us.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Convict lake is easily one of the jewels of the Eastern Sierra. It's beauty is some stunning.
There are walk ways restrooms and places for picnicing.  We typically go up in late September and the last 4-5 yrs fishing has been awful. Sadly, this isn't just Convict but the whole Eastern Sierra.< /Text>

The cabin was great, we were able to take our pup, and the trails around the lake were awesome with the best scenery. Saw deer everyday walking around the cabin and the little food truck serving breakfast was delicious. The staff were all so friendly. We definitely want to come back here.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Very easy to access lake along the highway 395. The leaves turn to yellow later than bishop so it's a good place to go if you miss the bishop red leaves. Mid-October is usually a good time to go. It's near Mammoth lakes so you can live in Mammoth and then stop by here when you're back from the trip.< /Review>

< Review>
My husband and I stumbled upon Convict Lake a few years ago driving from Yosemite to San Diego. After discovering convict lake, we were hooked on its beauty. A few years later, my boo and I camped here at the lovely campgrounds. During our visit this week, My hubs caught a trout on his tenkara fly fishing pole, and I went on a wonderful horse back riding trip. Pro tips: don’t forget to tip Randy the ranger, and buy your wood before 8pm!  This place is truly heaven.</Review>

<review>Rented a boat here with 3 friends and 5 dogs and had a real hoot sailing around the lake. You can pull up to the shore on the other side and get out and hike. We brought a Bluetooth speaker and some beverages and lunch and spent a very fun half day eating, singing and dancing out on the lake.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>My father used to bring me here as a child. A lot of things to do like hiking, fishing, and camping. We stayed in tents and in the cabins. The restaurant was very good. Lots of great memories here, and a very cool orgin story for this lake. If nature and being outdoors is your thing this is the place to be.<//text><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Convict Lake is one of the jewels of the eastern Sierra. The lake was carved by a glacier, and is one of the deepest in the area. A great place to hike and fish, especially with the enjoyable trail which rims the lake. Check out the magnificent Sevehah Cliff with its folded face of metamorphic rocks rising from the lake.</Text>< pictures>

With that being said, it's been several years since I have been here and it was way more crowded than I remembered. There were people everywhere taking advantage of the Majestic beauty of this place.
We were still able to find a little nook to hide away and enjoy a snack while looking at the view<//review>< Pictures>

I’ve been going to convict for around 25yrs and have always loved the place. This time it was way different than it ever has been. The campground was super nice and very clean like it has always been. That was great. First morning of fishing I decided to hike back to the inlet and try my luck. I get there get my spot on the shore and am enjoying the piece and quiet waiting for my first bite of the day. Out of nowhere comes a guy in the WATER with a full wetsuit snorkel and mask! I was like what the hell is this! Since when are people allowed to snorkel in the lake? Well that just ruined my fishing in that spot! I sit there for 3 more hours with not a single bite! So I changed locations to hangman’s tree (also a great spot to catch fish.) lm there for about 30 min and here comes 3 people on paddle boards about 15ft from shore. I had to yell at the so they didn’t get caught up in my line. At that time I was so upset with people having no respect for people fishing I just packed up and headed back to my campsite. I went back out later in the evening to the south shore only to get there and people had their dogs swimming in the lake! At that point I just said forget it and went back to camp! Second day was just as bad! People on rented pontoon boat had their kids jumping off the boat and swimming in the lake! Same problem with paddle boarders! Same problem with the dogs In the water! What I would like to know is when did convict lake become a  recreation lake and not one of the top  trout fishing lakes in the Sierra????. Sorry to say I probably will never go back!! Seems like it’s all about the money for them and not  preserving the natural beauty of the lake. Sorry to say but if you are looking at convict lake for a pure fishing trip. Pick another lake to go to! I should have stayed home and just put $1,000 in my fireplace and burned it!!!  And that is a sad thing to say about a place you love to go!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>my first visit was a big success. i had been trying out different dental practices in my area since the pandemic hit and they were fails until now. SM Family Dentistry got me in same day for x-rays, cleaning, and examine (a nice surprise as a first visit often has to be scheduled months in advance). Dr. Rubenstein had a great sense of humor and my hygienist, Chantal, was thorough yet gentle (another nice surprise since it had been 7-months since my last cleaning). i am very happy with this practice.< /review>< Pics>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>I’ve gone to SM Family Dentistry twice now and each time it’s been nothing, but a pleasant experience. I am terrified of dentist visits thus been prolonging needed procedures. Here is what to expect at this place: no long and painful wait time. Every technician is super friendly and extremely time efficient. I was so happy to discover that I did not have to lay in the chair drooling with my mouth open for half an hour. Seriously! Deep teeth cleaning was not the usual torture either. Looking forward to more. If you want to have a painless and pleasant experience with no waiting time, this is definitely a place for you. Can’t recommend it enough!< /review><Time>1625254081944< /Time>< username>

Santa Monica Family Dentistry is by far one of the best dental offices I have ever been to!

Dr. Rubenstein is extremely professional, friendly and knows what he’s doing. I have been there multiple times for cleanings and cavities and have never felt any heavy sales pressure to get more work done like I have with other dentists.

The office is extremely clean and feels safe. Every receptionist I have interacted with in person or on the phone has been extremely helpful, patient and shown great customer service.

I have had only great experiences at this office and I highly recommend!< /Text>

Their attention to detail and cleanliness cannot be matched. Every appointment has been a pleasant experience. Prices are fair. And the quality of the work is excellent.  The ability to include periodontal and implant services (which has been my primary need) provided superbly by Dr Mark Cohen, has been great!  Thank you!< /Review>< Rate>

Arrived from NY a year ago, I have been trying to find a good dentist.  I finally found one.  The staff here is wonderful, polite, and accommodating , my hygienists always do a great job and always speaking at length how to keep my teeth healthy. I am very very happy with Santa Monica Dentistry.. I have been several times and plan to visit this office !<//text>

< Review>
ALERT TO ALL CHICKENS!!

I am a grown man and still feel like a child when I have to go to the dentist.   I read all the positive reviews on SMFD and deiced to roll the dice.  Boy was I thrilled.   They are all so kind from the moment you walk in.  I told them about my anxiety and they understood and never judged me.  They went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and came up with some really creative solutions to help me through my visit.   OH and they are really good and doing the dental stuff too. All of my teeth work perfectly.  They explained all of the charges before the work was done and helped me with the payment options.
PLEASE fire your current dentist, who probably doesn't care about you and make an appointment at Santa Monica Family Dentistry right now.</Review>

<Review>Dr Rubenstein and his team make me feel like family.  I am greeted with a warm welcome. The service is professional and thorough.  They make room for me even in emergencies!  It’s only been four years but it seems like I’m a long timer.  I only wish I had this kind of service years ago!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Dr. Rubinstein is amazing, I came in for the first time today with a few concerns (pain on a tooth/ my teeth moving/possibly needing a crown) he answered all my questions and was so knowledgeable, I like him so much I decided he’s my new dentist. Also had a tooth cleaning with Jennifer and she was also so knowledgeable she found me a new dental floss that I love and made my teeth look and feel so clean. I decided to make her my new hygienist !! Love this place hands down best dental practice in LA.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I've been a patient at SM Family Dentistry for over a decade. Dr. Rubenstein is great, and takes his time with patients.  The hygienists are consistently good, and the front office staff keeps things running smoothly and efficiently. No long waits here because they do not overbook.< /Review>

Dr. Alan Rubenstein and his entire staff are extremely friendly and all are exceptional at their work. I have been going there for close to 20 years and they have always treated kindly and fairly.
I highly recommend them for your dental needs.< /review>

I moved to Santa Monica earlier this year, and found Santa Monica Family Dentistry after doing a search online for a nearby dentist who takes my insurance. So glad I found them. Dr. Rubenstein and his staff were friendly and welcoming right from the get-go, and the atmosphere in the office is very relaxed. I hadn't been to the dentist for a while due to COVID but I didn't give it a second thought once I got there. They were careful about screening and following protocols, and I felt very safe. I had a checkup with X-rays and a cleaning, and went back a few weeks later to get a crown. My experience thus far has honestly one of the best I've had when going to see a dentist. There's no doubt in my mind that I am now a permanent patient of this practice.<//Review>

I can only say excellent things about my dentist Dr Rubenstein, and my dental hygienist Dan. They are the most pain-free and professional individuals to ever treat my dental needs. I used to hate going to the dentist offices, now I have no fear and I actually look forward to it! They have helped restore my health which is more important than anything in the world.< /Review>

I’ve been coming here for 7 years. What I most appreciate is how efficient they are. The wait is rarely over 5m, and for a standard cleaning I’m usually out within a half hour.

Dr. Rubenstein’s pretty funny, and Ermy and Claudia at the front desk are so nice!< /text>

I have been going to Dr. Rubenstein’s dental practice for almost 10 years now and I will not go anywhere else as long as I keep living on the west side of LA. Not only are they a group of very professional and friendly dental practitioners but they are extremely efficient (never had to wait more than 5 mins) and are extremely knowledgeable when it comes to anything having to do with your teeth and gums. The front of house staff is always helpful and hospitable with any of your needs! I have recommended this dentist to my entire family and now we all are patients! Thanks Dr. Rubenstein and team!</Text>

<Review>I went in with a tooth ache and Dr. Rubenstein told me I needed a root canal.  I was completely freaked out due to all the horror stories my friends told me about their root canal.  Dr. Rubinstein was amazing.  He was calming and assured me it would be ok.  He talked to me throughout the procedure and explained each thing he was doing.  In no time it was done and I had no discomfort at all.  It was no worse than getting a filling.  It was amazing!!! During another visit he filled a small cavity without the need for numbing.  I felt nothing.  I am referring all my friends to Dr. Rubenstein.  He is a true professional in his field.  I have since moved out of the area but will continue to drive the 2 hours to continue going to him.<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate><user_id>114278853143306633722<//user_id><time>1625883195650<//time><gmap_id>0x80c2a4cab5f0a177:0x1e2446b1fa342cf3<//gmap_id><Name>Darian Salisbury< /Name><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

Dr. Rubenstein and the people in his office are the best.  He has been my entire family's dentist for over 20 years.  Dr. Rubenstein is conservative in his recommendations and none of us have ever had a situation where he has recommended a treatment or procedure that wasn't really needed.  He is highly skilled as are his technicians and hygienists. The condition of my teeth and my family's have never been better.  As an added bonus, everyone in the office is so nice and pleasant.< /review>

<review>I was referred to Dr.Rubenstein by Keyvan Rahmanian who obviously cares about his teeth and I was BLOWN AWAY by his intelligence, straight forwardedness, and his kindness and positive attitude. I have seen many dentists and I had very arrogant ones in the past close to the beach who just wanted my business and me to spend money, but Dr. Rubenstein has INTEGRITY and I will be coming back to him to work on my teeth because I trust his staff and him. I even recommended my mom to come here and will continue to refer other family and friends because it is seriously difficult to find a great dentist who is also very nice and honest. I love Santa Monica Dentistry and it is nice to know your oral health is in good hands!<//review>< Rating>

The entire team over at Dr. Rubenstein’s office really felt like family! Given all of the changes that this year has brought everyone, they were very warm and welcoming and all seemed to be in incredibly high spirits. I felt extremely safe and comfortable throughout my appointment, and what I loved the most was that they thoroughly explained what they were doing as they went and made sure that I was doing OK as well. You can tell they care for each other and their patients!

I left with a cleaner, brighter smile and look forward to my next appointment!<//text>

Amazing dentist!!!
I’ve always been scared when it comes to my teeth because I’ve had painful experiences before...
BUT I’ve gotten 4 wisdom teeth taken out here and recently got my teeth deep cleaned.
Excellent work, and little to no pain.
The dentist and staff are so nice and helpful too! Definitely recommend 👍🏽❤️</review>

<review>Salutations. From the minute I walked into dr Rubinsteins office I got the feeling I had found a good dentist. I found the good doctor a week after an old crown fell out while flossing. I didn’t want to go back to my old dentist because I doubted his competence after my last few visits. I am so happy to have found such a competent dentist. Cheerful office and friendly staff and more than competent assistants. Five stars for sure. Money well spent. Thank you Dr. Rubinstein and thank you Rolls and Abel. I no longer have a gaping hole in one of my molars which I thought irreparable.</review><Time>1596738740450<//Time><gmapID>0x80c2a4cab5f0a177:0x1e2446b1fa342cf3< /gmapID><response>None</response>< Pics>

I’ve been a patient of Dr. Rubenstein for over 10 years.  They’ve taken great measures to ensure the office is  safe for employees and patients during Covid. All staff wear gloves, masks and face shields. Patients get a temperature check and oxygen level reading prior to entering the office. The waiting room is set up to adhere to social distancing and appointments are spread out, so there’s not a lot of people lingering in the waiting room. I’ve always had a positive experience at Dr. Rubenstein’s and I feel extremely safe with all the precautions. 👍👍<//review>

<review>Santa Monica family dentistry is a unique experience! You are welcomed and personally walked to your chair with a “How are you doing today?”  along with eye contact that makes you think they mean it. The quality of the work is top 10%.  And they make sure repeatedly that you’re comfortable doing the procedure.  If you are not,   they adjust.  This is consistent no matter which hygienist or dentist you get.  You are a part of a community when you walk through the door. You a part of a community when you walk through the door And the best stress reducer of all is the financial part.  The front desk will run your numbers any way you like.  Urgently need $5000 of treatment now and don’t have the cash?  No problem!  They connect you up to get an interest free loan for a a year - to do the work now. Dental doesn’t get any better than this!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

The Covid-sterilization protocol is so thorough and impeccable I think I might feel even more safe in the SaMo Family Dentistry office than I do at home!
Doctors and staff are capable and pleasant,

This is my go-to dental office, even after moving away to Newport Beach. I keep coming back because this is the most quality, professional, and caring dental group I have ever encountered. Each and every person involved is the best in the business. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Rubenstein and his team for your dental needs.< /review>

<review>Great atmosphere and excellent service. I had gotten a 10 month job out of town last minute and needed my crown put in before I left, but it was at least another week until it was ready. They pulled some strings with the lab to do a rush job and I was able to get everything done the next day before I left. This is a top notch dentist office and I would recommend them to anyone.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp>< pics>

< Review>
I was impressed with both the adherence to Covid-19 protocols and the quality of the dental work.  Dr Rubenstein himself reviewed my x-rays and discussed corresponding issues, satisfying my questions and leaving me with a reasonable treatment plan.  The front desk was up-front about cost and had already determined exactly what my insurance would cover.

In addition, his office was able to immediately move me into a follow-on appointment for a deep cleaning.  Chantal, the hygenist, was a superstar.  Anyone with some dental "experience" can quickly tell the difference between a professional who truly cares about the patient and someone who may do a decent but less thorough job.  I commend Chantal for her dedication to her trade and her patient.

Overall, I would strongly recommend this office for anyone in Santa Monica -- or even on the Westside -- with dental needs.</Review>

One of the most comforting things that I have found to be really essential is to know that I have the finest dentist possible and that person is Dr. Alan Rubenstein.
It all begins the moment that I step into his office, where I am warmly & sincerely greeted by all of his staff to the very thorough, detailed and meticulous examination that follows and whatever subsequent treatments are needed.
Nothing is overlooked, every detail is attended to, and when I leave I go with full confidence that I have received the best possible care.
He really is that good, as is his staff.</review>

When I went in for my checkup, the whole staff commended me for no cavities. I felt like a kid. More importantly when work needs done they take the time to make sure I understand procedures and costs. Kind staff and doctors who explain everything patiently and clearly.

I feel I am in very good hands and it really does seem like family.<//review>

<review>I hate going to the dentist...I literally stop breathing when I walk in and hold my breath the whole time.  But Dr. Rubenstein was friendly, professional and personable and made it easier for me to relax. The office staff are great.  Even though I had to have a deep cleaning, everyone involved was compassionate and did their best to put me at ease.  All costs and relevant insurance coverage were clearly explained to me prior to getting services.  The office uses up-to-date technology, so you can see pictures of your x-rays in real time.  And the office is very clean and comfortable.  Happy to have found our new dentist!<//review>< pics>

My husband found this office from an ad offering big discounts. I was skeptical but he got great service so I thought I’d give it a try. I was so impressed. Clearly Dr Rubenstein understands that bringing a customer in for a consult can result in a long term relationship. I was given a full set of xrays and a consult and written estimate of work at no cost. Then I had a discounted cleaning. It was the best cleaning experience I’ve ever had. With both the dentist and the hygienist I felt listened to and thoughtfully dealt with.
The office staff are lovely and professional. The office is immaculate and modern.

I am so delighted with my new dentist office. I feel the costs for future work are appropriate and fair. It reassures me that I’m in good hands. Phew!<//text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Rubinstein and his team for about 19 years now. I don’t even live as close as I used to, but I keep going there. I always feel welcome. Everyone is very knowledgeable and skilled, and they all have a great attitude. They are proactive about the health of my teeth and gums;  they actually helped reduce the inflammation of my gums that had been there for years.  And they have helped me take better care of my teeth on my own. Glad I found this office so long ago.</Review>

Absolutely fabulous Doctor!  I haven’t been to the dentist for a long time and instead of making me feel bad he discussed how we need to fix the problems now. He was very honest with the prognosis and provided additional recommendations that were needed but allowed me to feel I have the opportunity to choose if I wanted proceed. He has my highest recommendation.< /Text>

<Text>I recently had my first appointment (routine cleaning) and a second appointment for routine dental work with Dr. Rubenstein and I cannot recommend him or his practice enough!  The staff and doctors are very friendly and really take the time to make sure their patients understand what is being recommended and done.  The very first time I met Dr. Rubenstein he made sure to let me know that he values open communication and that he wanted me to ask any and all questions I may have.  This alone made me feel really comfortable and I feel comfortable asking and discussing anything related to my care.  Again, I cannot recommend this practice enough.  They are amazing!</Text>< pics>

<text>I had a good experience for my teeth cleaning and gum follow up. Very nice staff and great dentist & periodontist that are very friendly and make me feel comfortable at every visit. I highly recommend them. The only bad thing is that it can be hard to find street parking by there.<//text>< pics>

"Enjoy" and "Dentistry" in the same review? Yes! Faced with an emergency situation, I turned to the team at Santa Monica Family Dentistry and was duly impressed by their professionalism and kindness... as well as their engaging personalities. Outstanding!</Text>

<Text>Fabulous and Fair dentist. Always greeted by first name as soon as I enter. Always on time. Easy metered parking and if you go over one of the dentist actually runs and fills your meter for you so you're never worried. I've had a few crowns a year and they work with my work schedule and always seem to have the times I want. Online scheduling is very easy. Every time I need a receipt they send to my email within 5 min of calling.  My cleanings are 3 times a year and they actually feel good. They never hurt me and I look forward to them. The bonus is great location with awesome views. Friendly staff.</Text>< pics>

<text>I have been with Santa Monica Family Dentistry for more than a year, and never been disappointed. Friendly, super attentive, staff and dentists that knows what they are doing and not trying to talk you into anything. Right in touch with insurance and let me know costs and options. Reminders by email, text or phone a day ahead make it easy for me to not forget appointments. Can only recommend this place. Been trying several places in Santa Monica before I found them via recommendation. Never want to go anywhere else again.<//text><user_name>Monika G</user_name>< Gmap_id>

<Review>My first time visiting Dr.Rubenstein office was a very pleasant experience!
The office is nicely located with plenty of parking. The view is beautiful.
I was very impressed from the first time I called to set up an appointment. The receptionist was very nice and personable.
Once I got there , I really felt  at home . The hygienist did a great job with cleaning my teeth. She was very smoothly.
The doctor 👨‍⚕️ was very friendly and not pushy at all. He went straight to the point in what he thought I should do next in terms  of next treatment.
I also loved the music 🎶 very nice selection 😀<//Review><pics>None<//pics><time>1558201460053<//time>< UserId.>

< Review>
I've gone through a number of dentists over the years in hopes of finding one  that truly cared about the health of my teeth and not just about how to make them look good. I managed to find adequate dental care in NY but was completely surprised and blown away by the treatment I received at Santa Monica Family Dentistry. The staff from the dentists to the receptionists are always friendly & knowledgeable. They answer all your questions, walk you through a treatment plan, make sure you are comfortable and well informed during the procedure and make sure you are up-to-date on any post visit care. They make the experience of visiting the dentist as pleasant as possible. You may not arrive with a smile but you'll certainly leave with one.< /Review>

<Review>This was my first visit and I cannot tell you how pleased I am with the whole experience!

The office was clean and lovely. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Claudia the front desk receptionist is so kind and helpful. Jennifer, who is a Gumm specialist was so charming and even made me laugh several times while she cleaned my teeth. Not what you’d expect to happen at a dentist visit!

Bonus! No cavities! Woo hoo!

I highly recommend this dental practice to everyone who’s looking for exceptional customer service and professional dental services!

You will not be disappointed!</Review>< Rate>

Fabulous dentist. I have been going to him for almost 2 yrs now. He really knows his stuff! He is great at explaining procedures, providing options and treatment in general. I love his staff and I am not dreadful about going back, which is my usual reaction to dentists. Very flexible with scheduling and good about keeping me on track with my care.</review>

As much as I hate going to the dentist, I love Dr Rubenstein and his staff. They are always warm, friendly and most importantly, careful not to hurt me while being very thorough and professional. Dr. Rubenstein always has the latest in dental technology  and makes exams and procedures the best they can be in any dental office. I highly recommend them.<//Text>

It's always a pleasant experience, thorough, careful and focused on making me comfortable. When I have had more extensive work done, they've explained it thoroughly and the fees were reasonable.

<Review>I just transferred to this office, and I have a complicated dental history. I was welcomed and treated with kindness, care, and professional expertise. The xray techniques were modern and painless (no cardboard digging uncomfortably into gums and floor of mouth--thank you, Ronnie!). All of the staff were polite and warm, yet professional. The hygienist, Dan, was careful and thorough, and Dr. Rubenstein was clear, knowledgable, and had a great chair-side manner. The experience exceeded my expectations.<//Review>< user_id>

The entire crew and staff at Santa Monica Family Dentistry is like family to me. They are so warm, personable and professional. I have been a patient of Alan Rubinstein and company since the early 80s, that's 1980. Could not recommend them more.<//text>

<Text>I have been a client of Santa Monica Family Dentistry for a good 10 years now. I appreciate that Dr Rubinstein is very good and swift at what he does. He does listen to his patients and is always readily available should any problem arise. Dr Cohen is equally good.  The office staff is very friendly and has been there forever. I highly recommend Santa Monica Family Dentistry.< /Text><rating>5<//rating><user_name>Yvon Chausseblanche</user_name><userid>112907103688940163824<//userid>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Had a thorough checkup and cleaning today. Have had several fillings in the past few years as well as two root canals done here.  Completely painless, quick and efficient. This is my typical experience here with all dental work i have had done. The assistants and dentists are very professional, friendly, thoughtful and perform great work.  Dr. Rubenstein always patiently and thoroughly answers my questions.<//Review>

It was by chance that I discovered the Doctors and staff at SM Family Dentistry. The name of the practice says it all. Each time I am in the office the entire team makes me feel as if I am in my own home. Today the "deck" was stacked against me, but Dr. Rubenstein and family rearranged things to accommodate my schedule. Impossible to believe that dental work can be this painless. Hats off to an above and beyond experience.

Thanks for the TLC,

J. G.<//Review>

<text>“Great” Dentist

Dr. A Rubenstein  has been my dentist since 2008 to present. The staff is well trained, educated, friendly and accommodating.  The office is always clean and comfortable. They have the latest equipment and you are out in a timely manner. I drive 53 miles to see Dr A Rubenstein, DDS (It is worth the drive😁.)<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Text>They give you a professional experience. Never have to wait more than 10 minutes. The staff are very kind and once I find a health care professional I tend to stay with them.

I  have been a patient of Dr. Rubenstein for 10 years now.  From the very beginning, I knew that I landed in the right place. Amazing service front desk staff to the hygienists, they make me feel comfortable with every visit. Dr. Rubenstein always gives me options and works with me to come up with the.best treatment plan within my budget. His work is excellent! I would not trust anyone else but him. Thank you for years of great service.<//review>

<review>Santa Monica Family Dentistry is hands down the cleanest most professional Dentist in Santa Monica area. The entire staff is awesome...its a very comforting environment. My daughter was terrified of Dentist when she was a little girl. After vist with Dr. Rubenstein...she looks forward to dental visits.

This is the most efficient, friendly medical office I’ve ever experienced. I have been going to Dr. Rubenstein for a while now and wouldn’t think of going to anyone else. The staff is a big factor in that - I would recommend them to anyone.</text>

I went in for a cleaning with no complaints and they insisted I needed to replace a filling. Over a year later and my tooth is now hypersensitive to temperature and contact. It hurts every day. Apparently this is common but usually goes away within a few weeks. If it doesn't go away, it indicates the dentist may have damaged the root. I have been back several times and they are recommending a root canal. Each time I visit, they find additional cavities to fill. Everyone is nice, but they are quite aggressive with recommending additional work and, well, you can see how much it helped me. I don't recommend this office and will not be returning.<//text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Rubenstein and Santa Monica Family Dentistry for years, and I wouldn't even consider going to a different dentist. Dr. Rubenstein and everybody on the staff have never been anything other than consistently and totally kind, friendly, and professional. The office is clean and modern, and I've always been extremely satisfied with the service I have received.  I give them the highest possible recommendation!</Review>

1. If you're worry-wart about pain, they gladly supply you with multiple anesthesia options.
2. My phone was dying, and someone on staff found a phone charger for me. totally didn't have to do it, but did. Still blown away. Obvs.
3. Most importantly, Dr. Rubinstein is an expert and has been able to successfully help me free my mouth from the aches & pains that came from the wear and tear of a candied life.

Thank you so much!</Review>< pictures>

So far so good!
Had a great consultation and cleaning with Dr. Rubenstein's team yesterday. After a fast and efficient x-ray session, Dr. Rubenstein laid out necessary fixes I would need to have in the weeks to come. He was professional and gave me a great breakdown of need vs. should. Dentists in the past have recommended procedures that I "should have" to just make a quick buck, where Dr. R told me what was necessary and thoroughly explained why. That right there is gold!
After meeting with Dr. R, I was onto my cleaning. The hygienist was fast, efficient and didn't flinch when an EARTHQUAKE happened mid-cleaning. She was a true QUEEN.
Excited to go back to the office to get my necessary procedures this upcoming week and spread the word!
Thanks Dr. R & Team!<//text>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2a4cab5f0a177:0x1e2446b1fa342cf3</Gmap_id><review>I’ve been coming to this office for a dozen years and can say that Drs. Rubinstein, Leland, and Saedi are truly professional, friendly, skilled and empathetic. The staff is great, office is clean, the views are nice, and pricing seems on par as well. I’m more satisfied here than I have been with other offices and it all works like a well oiled machine. I’ve referred family and friends here and they’ve always given me glowing reviews - my colleague needed an urgent dental surgery and they got her right in to a specialist the same day. High marks all around!</review>< response>

<review>I've been coming to S.M. Family Dentistry for over a decade and Dr. Rubenstein and his staff are always professional and strive to make my visit worry free.  Whether I'm getting a scheduled cleaning or a more involved procedure, the staff are dedicated to my well being checking on me throughout my time in the chair.  I feel like I have the best dental group in the city and always recommend them to friends and family.  Thank You Dr. Rubenstein and staff...keep up the great work!< /review>< pics>

Dr. Rubinstein is a true professional. The dental care I have received from him is the best I have ever had. He saved a tooth I was told would have to be extracted. The staff is friendly and courteous. Highly recommend.</review>

<review>I really Hate going to the Dentist's or to any doctor's for that matter. It was sort of an Emergency. They took care of me in really fast. I was never expecting that. They were Really Professional, Clean and it wasn't as painful as I thought. I even received a follow up call to make sure there wasn't any problems the following day.</review><gmap_id>0x80c2a4cab5f0a177:0x1e2446b1fa342cf3<//gmap_id><user>113083138862351917803< /user><Name>Moisés González< /Name><Resp>None<//Resp><Date>1443115198975</Date>< rate>

Dr. Rubenstein is really great. He's not a pushy dentist, like I've run into with others. He's kind, great at dentistry and keeps a we'll run office. I've been a patient for 2 years now and so has my boyfriend, we've never had anything but positive results!</Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>Dr. Rubenstein and his staff is absolutely the best!!! It’s not like other dental/doctor offices where you wait a long time just to be seen. I never wait long and everyone is always very personable and friendly. The place is always very clean too. I travel about 45 miles one way to have Dr. Rubenstein as my dentist, but it’s OK because he is the best. He is very knowledgeable and really cares about his patients which can easily be seen by the AMAZING work he does. I never leave disappointed.< /text>< pictures>

I was recommended to Dr. Rubenstein by a friend when my bonding on my front tooth chipped. I called the office and they were able to take me the very next day. When I got there they were fast, friendly, and worked with my insurance to get it figured out. I will be back for my annual check up!< /text>

Dr Rubinstein has been my dentist for several years now.

I was referred to him by my orthodontist when I was getting braces. He is also my orthodontists dentist so when I heard that I started using Dr Rubinstein.  It's now been 5 years that he's been my dentist and I have personally sent him between 5-8 new patients for various things.

It's nice that he always give me a fabulous gift card when I send a new client.

I'm also someone that is terrified of the dentist due to horrible experiences in the past but I now have lost all fears thanks to Dr Rubinstein.

10 star all the way.

👍🏻

Excellent service, never had to wait in the waiting room, why do they even have a waiting room? Dr. Rubenstein is amazing, so is his staff most of the staff has been there for years and know their customers by name, very professional and friendly.
We moved 13 miles further two years ago but still make the trip to see Dr. Rubenstein; the drive on the infamous 405 is worth it!</Review>

<time>1356027845036</time><Rating>2< /Rating><Text>I struggled with this review because I think the actual caliber of service is good/very good. What is difficult to rate is the office's bed-side manner, the other services that are pushed (mentioned by other reviewers), and the flat-out rudeness of the front office staff.

I actually had a case where some work came off from a few months prior. I had gone between Dr. R and a specialist so there was some confusion as to who needed to back the work and the billing girl actually asked me if I was questioning her accuracy. Coming from a medical family, I found the billing woman particularly confrontational, accusatory and completely inflexible (by flexible, I mean not working with insurance much).

My father always wanted to give people the best possible care and then would work around their insurance / financial constraints. Make no mistake - that's not the case with this office. It is more simply a yes/no - do you have money question. I understand the need to run a business and make a profit - but I think this is where bed-side manner could play a more helpful role.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Dr Rubenstein is supper professional, and very attentive to details. I just finished my Invisalign, which I started a while ago and which was a total fiasco, but Dr Rubenstein fixed it all and I am extremely happy with the result. The team is great too, everyone is very friendly and welcoming. I have a busy schedule and they can always fit me in their calendar. Definitely the right dentist for many many years.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>I was a former patient of Dr. Rubenstein and I am not happy with the services received. His chair side manner sucks.  He did a terrible job on a filling he said I needed which I do not think I  did and it hurts all the time. I had to find another dentist.  I asked about Invisaline and he said it would not help me I am too old...his staff some are nice some have the same personality as he does.  They also gave electric toothbrush that did not work. I brought it back and they had to give me another.  His office seems old.  I would not recommend him to anyone.  Three of my other co-workers once was his patient and all of us no longer want to go back...terrible.< /Text><Time>1458675171510< /Time><UserId.>107876623626681358755< /UserId.></record>

I went to see Dr Rubenstein, who my girlfriend had been going to and very happy with, and I had my teeth cleaned and a filling done. Dr Rubenstein did the filling himself and I couldn’t be happier with the job and the warmth of not only himself but the office personnel. My girlfriend is now my fiancé and our whole family goes to his office and are treated extremely well. The Covid protocol of the office is on point and it feels extremely safe, warm and accommodating.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>I had been going to dr Rubenstein for 3 yrs and every visit is great! Staff and dentists are extremely nice and well qualified. I had the pleasure of of investing in Invisalign which I was very pleased with. Unfortunately I had to move at the tail end of my treatment but it was a seemless transfer to another dentist to finish.

I’m sad to be leaving such a great dentist.</review>< gmap_id>

<text>Loved my experience today! It was my first time meeting Dr. Rubenstein and being a patient in his office. Everyone was super helpful, efficient and friendly. Dr.  Rubenstein is hilarious by the way. The service of all his staff was top notch. The office was busy when I entered, but they moved me through and I was out of there with clean teeth in no time. I am so excited to have been referred to Dr. Rubenstein through my boyfriend and look forward to my next visit.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

They are not very considerate of the patients time. Had an appointment confirmed for weeks and the same day I received a call followed by an email changing my appointment 30 mins later. I called back and confirmed my original time since I had other appointments. I arrived on time, waited, and was seeing 30 mins late!!! Even when I arrived and asked, they told me it was going to be 5 mins. In a previous occasion, I had a cleaning schedule for the last appointment and the doctor left before seeing me. I was asked if I could come back or wait for the doctor. Since their hours are not very flexible, I had to wait for the doctor to come back.< /review>

{'time': 1458693568786, 'text': 'What a timely review to respond to as both the Communicable Disease Center (CDC), and the American Dental Association are currently  working with the legislature to control the amount of pain medication which is being prescribed by doctors and dentists nationwide.\n\nThe amount of pills I prescribe for extractions is 10-12 tablets.  If you contact your pharmacist you will see that this is the standard most dentists prescribe..  The amount of tablets this patient was requesting is considered inappropriate.   If a patient still requires more pain medication we would want that patient to come back to the office to evaluate the extraction site and determine if the healing is impaired.'}<//Resp>
<Review>With out a doubt the WORST dentist in the history of Oral care! Zero bedside manner and after having my molar extracted (which hurt like hell) he gave 30 hours worth (a day and a half) of pain medication 10 pills. Proper procedure is 6-10 days worth. I asked for 5 days worth of medication and he read me the riot act. Saying he would lose his license to practice, the DEA would raid his office and then shooed me out of his office. Dr. Rubenstein is practice for one thing and one thing only, MONEY. DO NOT see this Dentist. Total fail!</Review>< username>

I have been a patient for decades!  Most people dread going to the dentist but I always say, "Not me!"  I love them all here.  Friendly, helpful, consistently kind, competent is how I would describe every staff member here.  Having come here for decades, it is so comforting to have them be one of my consistent "go tos" in my life despite life changes.  Thank you Drs. Rubenstein and Cohen and all the special staff there.< /review>

<review>HORRIBLE!! Got work done and thought it I was good to go. Flossed and brush regularly so I figured nothing major would happen. Turns out what he worked on wasn't done efficiently and my crown came off. I went back and he said I would have to pay for ANOTHER crown on the tooth that HE messed up on. RIDICULOUS! Especially because he knew the tooth wasn't done right. I would advise you to search for a better dentist.</review>< user_name>

I have been to many dentists over the years and I never felt relaxed at any of them until I found Dr. Rubenstein. Dr. Alan Rubenstein is truly a blessing and hands down the best dentist I've ever been to in my life. He makes going to the dentist pain free and there simply is nobody better at helping his patient than Dr. Rubenstein. I hope you can put your worries behind you and experience what a truly great professional Dr. Rubenstein and his team are.< /Text>

<date>1394757572735<//date><rating>5<//rating><review>Sitting in my back yard when suddenly at 4:30 on a random Thursday, a molar explodes. I call Dr. Rubenstein's office and they say "come on by immediately." Much to my sadness, the molar exploded due to a bunch of decay underneath an old filling (NOT by Dr. Rubenstein) and I have to have a root canal. My last root canal (again, NOT by Dr. Rubenstein) was a terrible painful long ordeal.

So imagine my surprise when the entire procedure was completed quickly and painlessly! I have now been a patient of Dr. Rubenstein's since July and I have to tell you, if you're in the area and you need a dentist, this is clearly the way to go.<//review>< Pics>

I first found Dr Rubenstein's office when I started working nearby and had an old veneer from a dentist back on the east coast pop off. The first place I called to fix it told me, emergency or not, the earliest they could see me was in a month! I called Dr Rubenstein and he said, "we can see you in a two hours. Is that ok?"

The customer service here is the best I've ever experienced. All the staff is super nice and the doctors all do top-notch work. I don't live or work anywhere near them anymore, but Santa Monica Family Dentristy is the only dental office I'll go to in LA.<//text>

<review>My experience was not good. In March 2015 I returned to Dr. Rubenstein's office after two years without dental work because of severe pain from a sudden cracked tooth which made it difficult to eat. Two hours later I left after Dr. Rubenstein and his staff completed xrays and insisted on a full planar cleaning of my teeth. Dr. R's staff did a good job of the plaque cleaning and resurfacing but they did NOTHING about the wobbly cracked tooth. A few weeks later I returned, complaining again about the cracked tooth and pain. I was referred to Dr. Cohen in the office who examined my cracked tooth, gave me a prescription for painkillers, and quoted me a nearly $6,000 price for a single dental implant, then simply waited for me to give him a thumb's up. Unhappily I left their office in pain and had the implant completed elsewhere for $2,000.<//review><gmap_id>0x80c2a4cab5f0a177:0x1e2446b1fa342cf3<//gmap_id><Rating>1</Rating></record>

<UserId.>113419314431432607076</UserId.><username>Scott Benton< /username><Date>1625261237159< /Date><Rating>5< /Rating><text>I’ve been a longtime patient at Dr. Rubenstein’s office for nearly 20 years now, and have had nothing but a positive experience with him during that entire run, as well as with the various hygienists I’ve seen there, dental assistants, and office team. In fact, the entire group as a whole has always consistently worked well for me to keep my teeth healthy, white, and strong over all the many years I’ve been going, and honestly, I couldn’t be happier with how my teeth currently look and feel.

Dr. Rubenstein’s group has always made it incredibly easy to visit their office even during more difficult and stressful appointments when the thought of going to the dentist traditionally keeps you up the night before an appointment. I have now had many experiences with them where I felt absolutely no pain whatsoever from start to finish during a procedure, largely because this group is always willing to go the extra distance, and do everything they can to help patients through the more traumatic aspects of dentistry—something that has kept me coming back to this one particular practice over and over again. And as I’m someone who is largely terrified of going to the dentist (I don’t want it to sound like it’s actually easy for me to go to the dentist), there’s a certain comfort I find I always have knowing I can get through anything with them that comes up. Because of the inherent safety level I get there, I have been consistent in visiting every six months, which not only maintains my teeth, but also helps to spot any potential problems long before they cause pain or damage. Overall, I really like this group, and have felt that way right from the beginning.

Like many of the other reviewers of this practice, I too have been asked by them many times about whether I wanted this service or that one—whether it’s a fluoride treatment or Invisalign, many of which I know I don’t need or want, and simply say no thank you. I’ve had braces three times, and don’t need or want Invisalign, and don’t need many of the services they offer, but I’m glad to know they are available in case at some point I do want them.

Whether it’s for general cleanings or repeated cosmetic onlays (which I have done, and don’t think I could have accomplished anywhere else quite as confidently), they have been accommodating, patient, understanding, and helpful. My own personal goal is to keep all of my teeth healthy, attractive, and functional for the rest of my life, and I know that with their attention to detail, with all the services they offer, and how easy they make it to go to the dentist, I will confidently reach that goal.

While I don’t have any complaints about this practice to offer, I do find parking somewhat difficult in that area in Santa Monica. Since you can’t park on the street anymore without a permit, you can either park in the building’s garage that you’ll then want to take the ticket and get it validated for. Or you can do what I do, and park in the lot near the corner of 14th and Wilshire. You can use cash or your ATM/credit card to pay for the parking, and it’s both cheap and conveniently right around the corner from the dental office.

And lastly, my one piece of advice to anyone going in for a cleaning, whether here or elsewhere, if you happen to have any “hot spots” or sensitive areas on your teeth where the ultrasound causes you any pain, take an Advil about thirty-minutes before your cleaning, and I can promise that you will have a far better experience during your appointment than you probably have in the past.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>
