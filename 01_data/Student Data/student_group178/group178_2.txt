<Text>Lived here for years, and it's a pleasant and quiet family park!

It's a very old place, and a mobile home park, so it's not perfection, but it's also a very unique place to be, with some worthwhile skylines thanks to the open views in the east, and the view between the mountains in the west.

The place is well kept, management does a great job trying to make sure everyone follows the rules accordingly. All have their own reasoning, so understanding and following park rules is fairly easy.

TLDR: Nice place, windy, clean, well managed, pretty skies!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtRsFx65QE7FMf2aI64S3ChepFVTn7vd9wznwa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp0DFZnYFTF-mw_czqRuhYL0itR7jz06N5S5tw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>Horrible place to live. Management is very unprofessional and if you raise a concern you are intimidated. Many residents have complain of being harassed and threatened. I come to visit family and we are followed by the manager’s husband. Feces has been overflowing from the septic tank and all they do is poor a bottle of bleach over it. Residents get charge sewage fees which doesn’t make sense if they can’t even shower without having feces ooze out from the shower drain. It’s disgusting and a health hazard. The residents asked for owner contact info and manager denies it. Manager Mercedes tells the residents to contact corporate. There is no contact info to be found other than the manager phone numbers. The city was called and when the professional was looking at the problem he was asked to leave the property by the manager.
Unfortunately this problem happens very often and residents are tired of being told it will be fixed with no progress.</review>< response>

The management is always around and very proactive to any incidences that happened at the park. There is wonderful security that keep the peace at the park and 24/7 security cameras. The community is also extremely clean. I hope you pick this place for your family no better place.< /Text>< pics>

Clean place and very attentive management. Management is very upfront of park rule enforcement prior to any agreements being signed. Management explains the most common enforced rules, no street parking, no visitors anywhere in the park without residents, children under 10 years have to be under parental supervision,  speed limit must be respected by Residents and visitors, do not alter anything in the unit exterior without prior written approval, ect. Simple stuff. We have lived here 18 years and we seen the place being cleaned up more and more. People that have made negative reviews are mostly people that do not live in the park that feel "entitled" to do as they please, where they do not live. People get emotional and post against management that they do not know. Management does actually enforce park rules and regulations. "Some Resident's" cross the line doing what they aren't suppose to, then they turn around and point the finger at management for doing their job. Management does question people they do not know walking through the park that do not live in the park, there are many no soliciting and no loitering signs through out the park, including signs that warn visitors to go to the space they are visiting, the Park Rules are clear, Residents have to be in company of visitors walking through the park. Then they get on here and make a bad review against management for what they did wrong. They dramatically exaggerate and put it into a bad review. Parents that let their children between ages of 4 years and 9 years old she calls their attention, they do not like it, but, it's their responsibility to keep after their children to make sure they aren't playing on the streets, between the units where the utilities are or being hit by passing cars. That's what those people making negative reviews do not mention. These reviews do not leave room to question those placing these negative reviews. Management is on top of management in the park, the place is well maintained. Quite, secure and a good place to raise a family!!</text>

Sadly this park has a horrible early history. My family has lived here around 11 years now and I can tell you this is a family park. The property manager and grounds keeper do their best to make sure the residents, the children, and the homes are safe. She knows who is going in and out. She makes sure we have no theft from outsiders. Yes there are horrible neighbors in the park who try to make her and this place look bad. But I can tell you since I moved into this park  and took over my parents home I have never felt safer in a place than I do here. Keep up the good work! Dont believe the lies if you are interested in this place. Give it a chance.< /Text>

All these people with their negative remarks dont take the time to consider exactly how much time and effort is spent to stay on top of an entire community. Reguardless of where you live, there will always be 'those neighbors' that never seem to be satisfied with anything, and complain about everything... but there will also be friendly neighbors that smile and say hello everyday! As for the comment about not seeing any children running around, open your eyes and look around because there are kids playing all the time... And as long as they follow the park rules they can play until their hearts are content! Managers here go above and beyond to make sure we can sleep in a safe neighborhood. I have seen management handling situations at 3am and they did not go home until everything was finished and secured. In my opinion they are doing magnificent tending to the job they are required to do!! I certainly doubt any of the negative people could do their job any better!!</Review><gmapID>0x80db18ecc4825339:0x7460b3d8d6df702f</gmapID>< Rating>

The management is very unprofessional and always harassing my family we were walking around minding our own businesses and she started to follow us. The kids got scared so we had to go inside. Very rude and disrespectful. The management needs to be addressed and changed this has been going on for a couple of months now</Review>

I live here, this park is pretty quiet and the manager is great she's always on top of everything. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is due to the wind, it's very strong here. Compared to places like corkill Park this place is heaven it seems to me the only people that don't like it are the ones wanting to cause problems or have a problem personally with the management all she does is try to keep the place safe and secure don't be so hard on the good manager learn to appreciate good management< /text>

I came to visit and the manager ran after me, I felt harassed. She made us feel extremely uncomfortable. She mentioned that she had to be notified when someone was visiting and that the tenant had not inform her. However, this is not a gated comunity its open and we were not here to visit her nor were we causing any problems. Why the need to inform her and not to mention she looks like a crackhead yelling at visitors for simply taking a walk around the park with children.< /text>

Car was keyed by neighbor who cause felony damages to my rental car for parking in her spot even though the Manager had told us anything in the open lot was guest parking. Manager then came yelling at me the next day because the women told her I had said she was going to pay for the damages. Management is constantly harassing and extremely unprofessional.<//Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Response>None< /Response><pics>None</pics><Text>(Translated by Google) In 2017 we moved to this mobile home park thinking about having something a safe place to live at the beginning it was nice, although with some problems with the maintenance of the trailer that we acquired with effort, the down payment requested by Manager Mercedes was given, which with very good attitude when starting the procedures because a profit for her but as time went by the payments were increasing too much she began to harass her for anything insignificant harassment and thus she was increasing the additional payments than security payments for the place and one of the occasions A homeless man was sleeping inside my truck outside my trailer I honestly could not refer to this place to live is a robbery and for my health and my peace of mind I decided to lose my trailer that with much sacrifice I tried to have but with bad management of the manager and their attitude a professional hopefully one day they can investigate the way they steal money.

En el 2017 nos mudamos a este móviles home park pensando tener algo un lugar seguro donde vivir al principo fue agradable aunque con algunos problemas con el mantenimiento de  la traila que adquirimos con esfuerzo se le dio el down payment que pedía la Manager Mercedes  que con muy buena actitud al.empezar los trámites pues una ganancia para ella pero al pasar el tiempo fueron incrementando demasiado los pagos empezó acosar a molestar por cualquier cosa insignificante acoso y así fue incrementando los pagos adicionales que pagos de seguridad  para el lugar  y una de las ocasiones un homeless  estaba durmiendo dentro de mi camioneta afuera de mi trailer Sinceramente no podría referir este lugar para vivir es un Robo y por mi salud y mi paz mental decidí perder mi traila que con mucho sacrificio trataba de tener pero con Mal manejo de la manager y su actitud un profesional ojalá algún día puedan investigar la manera que roban dinero.<//Text>< gmap_id>

I ordered: Spicy tuna crunch roll and Shrimp + chicken Pho. The sushi might have been ok if the crunch roll wasn't more chewy than crunchy, while the tuna didn't taste fresh or spicy at all. No soy sauce was provided.
The Pho. Zero flavoring in the broth from the jump. And if you know the basics of Pho, you understand this is absolutely the base of everything. The shrimp were, well shrimp, the chicken provided had such a strange odor and weird taste. I'd hoped put all together, everything would come together. NOPE. Worst Pho soup ever and being that I cannot find it in my heart to waste food, this was excruciatingly painful to finish. I couldn't do it.
DO NOT EAT HERE.
The generic name should be a fare warning to the generic and lacking taste of edible food.</text>< Name>

<Review>I cannot say that it is the best pho that I’ve had compared to other places that I’ve tried. This Pho had an odd taste and flavor.My wife enjoyed their Thai ice tea with boba though.
The fried rice was good but shrimp was still cold and rice was burned. I was upset and surprised on the good reviews this place has to be honest. lol</Review><user_id>106636391931295109670<//user_id><resp>None</resp></record>

<Review>I'm a regular at the place and I can't emphasize how much I love eating here. The food is Fresh and delicious. The owners are incredibly kind and generous. I recommend the Pho and Thai Iced Tea personality, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< UserId.>

<review>Incredibly efficient and fast service. Was in and out within 45 min but didn't necessarily feel rushed. I had the chicken pho and thought the broth was great - definitely mix in the hoisin and sriracha sauce on the tables to give it more flavor!</review></record></dataset><record>

My go-to Vietnamese restaurant in LA. The food is always consistent. Fresh, quality ingredients in a CLEAN restaurant (y'all know some of the ones in SGV and Westminster have questionable food handling and cleanliness).< /text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Vermicelli left something to be desired. The lettuce was iceberg, and there was very little else besides lettuce a noodles (a few cucumber slices, carrots, nuts, and green onion),  but no cilantro or bean sprouts, etc. As a result, the fish sauce was not enough to season it, but taking it to go means no hot or other sauces to help it along. The egg rolls that came with it were, however excellent, so I will try more of their hot food on another occasion.< /text>< Name>

Come here often for a quick bite. One of the few healthier alternatives in the ghetto. It's very affordable but lacks the "kick" or aroma that would've elevated it from merely a "decent" restaurant. Plenty of parking and safe. I've walked to it by myself late at night.< /Text>

We came to this restaurant by accident but we're glad we did! We chose this restaurant because it was convenient and "busy but not too busy." The wait and service were a little slow but the food was excellent. We had the basil chicken and the lemongrass chicken and both were excellent and came in large portions. It was pricy for lunch but very good.< /text>

First time eating at this restaurant. My family and I liked the food, definitely we're gonna come back. The food was great, no salty at all, and I guess they don't use msg which is a bonus because I'm sensitive to it. Place was clean and cozy, great price for the portions, the lady who was taking the order is friendly and give a good costumer service.</Text>

I try $8 pho special, and it is not vietnamese pho of any styles. But It is a disgrace to vietnamese communities to call your restaurant vietnamese pho.  As a vietnamese I am offend by been tricked to go to a restaurant with a Vietnames name that it is not vietnamese food... nothing here tasted vietnamese or even Chinese for that matter. Image going to a Mexican restaurant and they served you nothing but Chinese food dishes with Mexican  names on their menu. If I could, I would given a zero star rating. Again there are no vietnamese foods any styles....at this restaurant. If you want real vietnamese food please do not go here, i truely can't label what kind of food styles this restaurant is cooking.<//Review>

<Review>This was the first time using their ⛽ and it was a bit confusing 😕 but after trying 5 times I was able to filled up my tank.
Next time I will try to remember not to come here no one helps and there's not much options you can choose for the type of gas I always use the Supreme<//Review>< Time>

< Review>
Foodies suggest  that if you are within 5 hours of a foodie place you should divert. Follow this advice (generally)...if you are within 509 miles of this place, GO! If you have sworn off hot dogs too bad for you, you are making a huge mistake. Their buns by themselves are worth a three hour detour nevermind their dogs. Buns are sweet and tasty, hot dogs snap in that way that only NYC street dogs do. Get the dog with everything and prepare yourself for a heavenly meal. Again, if you think hot dogs can't be elevated to a gourmand level it's ok by me. The rest of us can only benefit by your conceit.</Review>

<Review>What a cute little station! The only place to get gas in Yountville.
Not your average gas station and convenience store you can buy wine here!
My coffee and espresso spot, drinks & snacks.
They made me a deli fresh hot dog  wow was it good (can’t eat healthily all the time what fun would that be!!)
This works for me!< /Review>< Pics>

Went to the French Laundry the night before coming here. Was somewhat hung over/amazed that I did not throw up after drinking so much wine. I was told that the hot dogs here are pretty good and given that I spent so much at dinner and managed to successfully enjoy my wine pairings, I figured this place would satisfy my hang over caloric intake and salt needs. Hot dog was reasonably priced and delicious. Ambiance was very cute as well.< /text>

A local told us to stop here for hot dogs. After a disappointment at Bouchon Bakery, we were thrilled by the quality of the dogs, including all the toppings and the amazing home-made rolls. This place is fantastic!< /Review>

<Text>Bad service counter help picks favorites

So we live in Yountville and we go there  for their ice cream we called before to make sure they had the ice cream and  no one answered so we went we ask the the counter people if  they had the ice cream and they said they did but but they didn’t since we walk from our house we were incredibly  disappointed that they did not have the ice cream  because the machine wasn’t working So we grabbed some gelato bars from their freezer but then we saw a little girl some how she was eating very appealing soft serve 🤔🤔🤔 so some how the machine was working ?  Nobody tried to inform us that the soft serve was ready they were very rude and not nice they didn’t even bother to ask us if we wanted soft serve after we Asked when it would be ready

Thank you for reading my review

<Text>Very friendly people here .but gas prices are high and merrchandise is sold at a.premium which means this establishment doesnt catet to the locals but it is the only gas ststion in the town of Yountville however they will purchase Gas here if it is a neccesity.  There are other gas stations within five miles off hwy 29 south of Yountville toward Napa.</Text>< Pics>

Great local business and the only gas in Yountville.  Support the little guy and grab some gourmet goods while the pump is running.</Review>

<Review>—So im giving it a 1 star because it was a nice clean atmosphere, i was there on a weekend and an older blonde hair lady was at the register, she was really nice to her customers in front of the me, but when I reached the front and told her which pump and handed her my money, she looked a me very rudely and said you know thats the premium side,  I asked her what's the difference, she said in a very in a rude tone, i dont know, so I asked her you work here and you don't know, she answered even more rude, No! I don't know, I just said ok , i got my gas and left. But couldn't help feeling upset, i consider my self to be a very respectful polite person,  but the way she talked and looked at me, made me feel so disrespected and belittled.  From my experience,  she needs to work on her customer service skills.<//Review><userid>111541258169769761764< /userid></record>

<text>I wouldn’t consider this a traditional poke place, it’s a little closer to sushi than poke. The toppings aren’t the same as you’ll find elsewhere but it is still a good bowl. Not my favorite but still good!<//text><Rating>4< /Rating>< GmapID>

My favorite poke place. They are consistently fresh and good. I've never gotten sick from eating here. People that work here are kind and helpful. I always get salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, sushi rice, spicy mayo, no ginger, no cucumber, no corn, with jalapenos, and extra white onion. Perfection. I eat here all the time.<//text>

Hands down, my go-to Poke place. They have a good selection of condiments and fish. Their spicy tuna has got to be THE BEST spicy tuna I've ever had. And I've had a lot from both Poke and Sushi spots. The staff is friendly and the food is always delicious. Take the time to have a conversation with the manager, she's a sweetheart! Highly recommend this place, for the price and amount of food you get, it can't be beat!</review>

<review>The poke was amazing! You can choose from a list of suggested bowls or you can create your own bowl by choosing fish type, other ingredients, and sauce. The food was served fast and the fish was fresh.<//review>< Resp>

Food tasted great.  Nice woman running the register.  And really fast service.  Highly recommend. Portions were excellent considering the price.   If you want more fish order the bowl with four items. It was plenty. There were also lots of extras in the bowl like imitation crab, dried seaweed, seaweed salad, ginger, corn, etc. I will come back.<//review>

The spicy tuna bowl with a salad base is delicious. The ingredients tasted fresh and the price was very fair. I don't eat poke too much but I've been here twice and it's great each time< /review>

Besides tommys sushi in tustin who started poki over 35 years ago ..mad props kinda far from my house but the fish quality destroys all the poki houses popping up everywhere. Pricing pretty good to..

Not used to a restaurant-service-style poke place, but service was great. I asked for dried onions and garlic, but they put a LOT on. A bit too much. Still, the flavor overall was good and the fish was fresh. Just please, ease up on the toppings.<//Text>

This poke shop is one of the few poke places that I frequent. Location is a kinda weird(Behind a red lobster) but their fish and veggies are very fresh,you can either make your own bowl or get one of their few pre-made bowls. My favorite bowl is the lovfish bowl. Inside is nice and clean staff is also very friendly< /review>

<text>The food is always fresh and delicious. They have a pretty good selection of toppings for your poké. Two of my favorite things are their albacore hand rolls (if you just want a snack) and the fact that they offer fresh squeezed grapefruit juice as a drink among with green tea and i think lemonade(?). My brother and I have made a tradition of picking up dinner there to go and eat it while watching UFC fights.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>This place is outstanding among Poke places. The food is above and beyond, consistently. The owner is kind and has a loving family way about her. The restaurant is always clean and the workers are happy. Vicki is a gift to the community and her talent is easy to see and taste. 💙 Her and Chef make poke an excellent experience at a reasonable price.<//text>< date>

Restaurant looks nice.
This is not the typical Hawaiian / Orange County style poke place.
I was tempted to give this place three stars however the portions are smaller than average, and you're not allowed to customize the bowl as you go.
I've been to a few other poke places like this and was aware of the style however my friend was not and the staff was not good at explaining the difference.
I feel if they have done a good job of explaining the differences between the style poke and what most people are familiar with I probably would have given them three stars.
If the portion size was up to par with the rest of the Poke places in the area I would have given them 4 stars.
And if I was allowed to customize my bowl as  they made it I might have even given them five stars.<//Text>

For the price this place offers so much food. Ussually you only have three selections of sides but here you are given them all. The fish is high quality and its filling. The staff is very warm and its atmosphere is great.
My only cons, which isnt a drawback, is how the small the place is, the rice is sometimes undercooked and how you cant see the poke being made<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Poke bowls were decent, but you have to pay for all the little extras that are usually included.  Also you cannot see your bowl being made which I don't like.  When you walk in it smells a little like a porta potty...  Not so appetizing.<//text>< Pics>

I love this place! My BFF and I came here on a whim and I'm so happy we did. Theybmske it super eater friendly and They were very patient with all of our questions. The price is very affordable for a delicious, healthy meal that you create yourself. It's sort of hidden in a shopping center, but once you find it, it's easy to come back to. I highly recommend this place to anyone.< /text>

<review>I went few times per month, i also bring there friends because the fish was fresh and the poke good but Last time, the salmon wasn't fresh anymore.
I told the person in charge, and instead of proposing me another bowl of tuna or other, the manager let me like that, without eating , she just said: ok you won't pay your bowl...
NO excuses or nothing else.
I took the first piece of Salmon in mouth and i have to go to the bathroom spit and rince my mouth, really not fresh at all...
This was the 1st time in one Year i came.
The manager didn't release that i come everytime with new costumers and friends... TO BAD...
Her reaction was so bad and rude.
I won't go there anymore !!!< /review><response>None</response></record>

<Review>I took one star off because they tend to go very light on sauces. I asked for extra spicy mayo this time and it was still as dry as the first time I got it. Other than that, the food is delicious and I would still recommend this place to friends.

< Review>
My first experience with a poke bowl and I loved it! Came back a second time during my visit to the area. Their poke bowls are ordered at the front and freshly packed behind the counter as you wait.< /Review>

Bummed I didn’t get to watch them put it together like most poke places but overall it was good enough. The fish didn’t taste funky or anything just the portions weren’t very generous, but the vide inside is cool.</review>

The food is great but the chopsticks they give you to eat it aren't so great.
The chopsticks feel really cheap and take away from the experience.</Text>

The good is GREAT, prices are reasonable (comparable to other poke joints), staff is very friendly, and there usually isn't a wait. We've only ever gotten food to go, but they do have some level of table service.</review>

It is very important for any place that customer service is the top priority and the staff here seems to excel in that, warm welcome faces working hard to prepare your food while maintaining an under control mellow environment, its no surprise that alot of foodies rave about this place, it is, put simply, great!<//review>

Great variety. Knowledgeable staff. Only downfall is the unwanted "professional" opinion forced on me every visit... I really don't care what you think, I just want you to point me in the direction of the requested item< /Review>

I freaking love this smoke shop, but I love the one that they own in Watsonville even more! The people that work there are just cool, prices are fair, and they're open late. Love it</review>

Good selection of vape accessories could juice but prices are a bit high even for brick and mortar when buying online is as much as 50 to 75% cheaper.  I know they got Bill's to pay to stay open but still prices are over the top< /Review>

He proceeded to show me about 6 different ones that were poorly made or cracked. The staffs additude seemed very rude when i was just trying to not by something not already broken. You could easily get something better even if you looked online. I ended up not getting anything and going to 'Irie Motivations' on Portola and had much better luck. Better prices, nicer staff, better glass (most made in house).

As a new member of the Institute for Luxury Home Marketing, I received a recommendation to use this company for some real estate brochures.  Very pleased with the results.  Super fast, great quality, ... I approved the final design on a Friday, and received the finished brochure in CANADA 4 days later, on Tuesday.
Highly recommended< /Text>

The quality of the marketing materials is exceptional. I'm very pleased with my investment! The customer service is great too, they're very responsive & they answer every single question I have. I don't have any ROI #s yet, as I've been using Real Marketing for 2 months. The lack of ROI at this point is the only reason I didn't give a 5 star review.< /Text>

<review>I started using Real Marketing two months ago. After my first mailing went out I received a call for a listing presentation on a home in my area of choice. I cannot express how thrilled I am to see that the marketing effort has worked. Also, the company is a total pleasure to work with. All of the staff from the sales agent, to the contact person, the graphic designers and the mailing department are a pleasure to deal with. Understanding that they know the market and they know what works puts me at great ease.  I believe they work to help agents achieve their goals. They are always there to help.  Their billing is superb with the attached invoices. I never feel like I have to check anything or make sure anything is correct. They are true professionals.  I hope to have a long and continued relationship with this amazing company.</review>< rating>

I just want to thank everyone at REALMarketing, but especially Holly Harris, for helping me get my real estate career off to a good start.  Working with Holly has been a real pleasure. From my first contact with Holly, I knew I was in for a treat. She had a short conversation with me and got to know me as a person. I think that her impression of me was used to design the perfect reflection of me into my Market Update. She absolutely nailed what I was looking for! I actually missed an early email that she had sent to me, that included several different styles to look through in order to choose a style direction. She is so intuitive that after simply talking to me on the phone, she used her ability to connect with me, to guide her design. When I did look through the designs, I was really glad that I did not choose one because I may have missed the opportunity to witness her untethered artistic style.

I also have to note how quickly and effectively Holly communicated with me in order to complete my project, in the shortest time possible. I had several questions about the wording of things and placement of things that Holly easily understood and quickly edited. For about three days, we went back and forth making improvements. I started by loving the design and after each change, I grew even more impressed with Holly's ability to understand exactly what I was looking for.

Holly has more than just artistic style; she is also a master wordsmith. There were several areas where I wanted to convey ideas I could barely express and Holly magically transformed those muddled comments into professional soundbites. The talking points that Holly so eloquently expressed for me are priceless! I will now be using her verbage to convey my ideas to my clients. I find that to be an exceptional added benefit of working with Holly! I feel like working with her has made me a better Realtor!

My experience working with REALMarketing already has me singing your praises.</text>

<Text>I started a Market Report direct mailing campaign last January.  I have received many compliments on my professional report that is sent out.  It is super easy for me as Real Marketing does all of the work.  If I ever have any changes to make there are never any problems.  I am very happy.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>My mailers went out last week and I just got a cold call yesterday just to say how beautiful and professional the monthly marketing reports look, and how much he appreciates the hard work that went into it.  I'm getting great feedback and Holly especially was very helpful in creating our absolutely gorgeous mailers.  Totally recommend.</review>< pics>

<Review>From start to finish, my experience with Real Marketing has been 5 Star.  The real standout is the marketing specialist who was assigned to me.  Marketing Specialist Kim Puentes not only does an excellent job on design, but she is always there when I have a question, whether or not it is regarding design.  She is a real asset to the Real Marketing Team.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<user_id>109025937512704469936< /user_id><text>Definitely would recommend! They are on top of it... for us, the hardest part of monthly mailing's are getting them out consistently and not micro-managing. The team at REAL Marketing does a great job staying on top of you, understanding your vision, and executing. I have never recommended another mailer/marketing company, however I would highly recommend REAL Marketing - feel free to contact me if you'd like more info on what they have done for our real estate team.<//text><date>1591972871206< /date>< rating>

I am very happy with their monthly mailer product. The material they use is very high quality and extremely cost effective. The design team is dedicated to making it personalized to reflect my business. I started with the monthly mailers at the beginning of the year and have had nothing but good feedback from my clients. Thank you!</Text>

I have just started to work with Real Marketing two months ago recommended by another RE/MAX agent. It was such a great experience with the team so far. Everyone got great taste on the design, and captured exactly what I wanted for my advertisement. Everyone responds very fast. And last but not the least, I have a few clients who have received my monthly newsletter in the buildings I advertised, they felt so impressed by the design and the content. I believe in the value Real Marketing has brought to me, and will continue working with them.</Review>

Working with Real Marketing has significantly improved my business! Their brochures and market reports are unbelievably crisp and eye catching, and they have made me stand out from the other Realtors in my area. My clients are always impressed. The staff is so nice and most importantly, they get the job done and your orders to you quickly!! Real Marketing will have my business for a long time and is highly recommended to anyone looking for exceptional marketing materials.</Text>

We have been extremely happy with REAL Marketing. We use them to design all of our brochures and postcards for our luxury real estate listings. Their turnaround time is extremely quick, they're very patient with edits/changes, and the quality of the work is very high-end. We work primarily with Samantha and she is fantastic. The mailing department is also great to work with. Overall, they make everything very easy and seamless. I highly recommend their services.<//text>

I am very happy with the design process for my marketing material. I was provided with great marketing ideas and at the same time, the staff listened to my concerns and ideas while providing great feedback. As a very busy Realtor I was happy that the whole process was not time consuming for me. The end result was an attractive & professional marketing mail-out that is steps above my competition. I am looking forward to a continued marketing relationship with Real Marketing.< /text>

I highly recommend Real Marketing for any of your real estate marketing needs.  They assisted me in becoming the neighborhood expert in my geographic farm, resulting in tripling the number of listings I've taken in a very short time.  Their expertise in knowing how to reach potential sellers, and the professional marketing tools they employ put you above the crowd.  If you are selling a luxury listing, this is the kind of company that you want  to handle the intricate and specific details that market demands.  Across the board,  Real Marketing has exceeded all of my expectations!< /Review>

The experience with working with Julia on two properties has been amazing. The quality of the materials created are luxurious and breathtaking. Julia helped me get everything I needed on time and we have trouble with my email. She went the extra mile to make sure we overcame that hurdle and get the materials complete and on time! Thank you!<//review>

< Review>
Just signed up and already have my first monthly mailing out the door. BTW - I've received more positive feedback on this one mailing than any mailing I've done in 20 years of business. The most common buzz word I hear when people tell me they received the piece is "QUALITY." They loved the quality of the information and the piece itself. It stands out from the other crap people send.

We received help at every step and all of our questions were answered quickly and correctly. Setup was a breeze and they gave us precise directions along the way. Basically you get an email and you follow the detailed instructions and it's super easy if you have the photos they need and ad copy. So far so good!</Review>

<Review>I have been using REAL Marketing for almost 3 years now and the results keep growing. I was able to break into a few different neighborhoods with no real previous track record of success and instantly become recognized as the neighborhood expert. I get calls all the time saying, "I know you sell a lot of houses in my neighborhood..." and the listing appointments I go on from these mailers are more "come list me" calls rather than "I'm interviewing a few agents". Wade & Sarah have been extremely helpful with getting the data on which neighborhoods to target and designing the perfect mailer every month. I just send in any info on any new listings I receive and they do all the work. I highly recommend them!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

For the past several years we have used REM to produce and mail our monthly newsletter to our luxury home farming area in Scottsdale, Arizona. The RESULTS are overwhelming and have brought us numerous million dollar listings. Hardly a month goes by without several recipients of our newsletter contacting us to express their praise for the content. Many of these recipients of the newsletter go on to list their homes for sale with us. Some have also referred us as Buyer agents to their family and friends. We could not ask for better RESULTS. We salute all REM company representatives for their efforts in contributing to our success.

This place is alright if your looking for some place to smash real quick, they have porn on tap, the beds aren't the most comfortable. The rates are sort of high for being a motel that rents by the hour...<//Review>

I celebrated my nomination earlier this evening in this gorgeous place. I am glad to say that we had a superb evening and the venue was absolutely one of the reasons for the successful meeting. The crew  cooperated in a very nice way, the meals were extremely good and my buddies were very  overjoyed. We shall no dout return for more celebrations. Thank you very much.< /Review>

<Text>Only one person behind the counter, after waiting behind three other customers, she told me she was out of the tub of the day. For chicken instead at the same price I said yes. After making the sandwich tried to charge me full price for the chicken, would you substitute for the sub of the day. Careful with the bait and switch< /Text>< pictures>

I often take my friends to this restaurant with my warmest recommendations. I visit this restaurant often. I get very good feedback from my friends. The meals are great and the stuff is generous and cooperative. Whenever we eat in this place we enjoy a cheerful time.  I warmly recommend this restaurant.< /Text>

Half the meat that other subways use. The toppings were all disgusting. Lettuce and spinach were nasty and changing colors. Subway is supposed to be fresh. This place was not even remotely close.< /Text>

They are not open till 9pm as this states. I was told they now close at 8pm by the gas station attendant.  That would have been fine for my needs, accept, tonight, they locked the doors by 7:50pm, I assume so they don't have to stay
late to clean the line. Very disappointed. This is a Subway at a Truck Stop. 9pm is convenient. 8pm is doable. But locking up early, very unexpected. Thankfully we wont stop here again.</text>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Came here for sandwiches with the family on our way back from LA. Doors were closed and locked and it was only 6:45pm. Hours posted on the front sign said open till 8pm. Workers inside were cleaning up and when I knocked on the door they motioned that the store was closed. When I pointed to the sign on the front door and looked at my watched they just turned around and continued to clean. Either they were trying to go home early today or their hours posted were not correct. Either way just a bad experience. Would give 0 stars if was an option.</text>< Pics>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Soooo much sugar! I tried the salted caramel macaron icecream sandwich the first time I went. Second time, I tried the blueberry crumble. Both times, I could harldly taste the flavor of the icecream. I think the macarons are too sweet for me, but hey, if a sugar rush is your thing, you'll love it.

I also tried a red velvet popper, which is a mini cupcake. I could taste the actual red velvet, and it wasn't too sweet for me.

Next time I think I'll just try the ice cream by itself and see if they're more flavorful.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1540786392217, 'text': 'I think you have the wrong store.  We don’t have any of the flavors that you mentioned !!'}</Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>The hours online and on the door states they close at 11pm on Saturdays. I drove in the rain tonight to get some yogurt and they decided to close an hour early cause they said it was “slow”. Call first before you waste your time going to this place. There was 4 other customers outside as irritated as I was.<//Review>< Pictures>

Store are super small. They have a variety of playing mat to select. They mainly focus on Magic the Gathering and then 2ndly Pokemon. But yes they do have a little bit Yugioh card sealed pack for sale too. The only displayed card they have a Magic.<//review>

Just went in today friendly atmosphere, customer service, and plenty of card products.

Even if its focused more on Magic products, as a Yugioh player the guy in front talked about Infernoids which was hella cool.

It was tempting to buy the box for Blazing Vortex. They play tournaments there so hopefully that comes back after this pandemic.< /Text>

I was pleasantly surprised at this store. Good prices, friendly atmosphere, and a large stock of cards/supplies. They even have a dedicated area upstairs to play.< /Review>

The Arcane Lab is a great place to find a game of Magic: The Gathering, Vanguard, YugiOh, Pokèmon and many other card/board games.

The event support is very good Standard (FNM), draft, sealed and commander being the big ones.

The sell mostly cards for standard and a bit of modern cards aswell. Sealed product can vary, but as far as Magic they always have the new sets, commander decks in stocks and sleeves. Aswell as DND stuff, vanguard sealed product and pokèmon. Binders for commander consists of mostly new stuff with a small variety old or rare* stuff.

I try to buy most of my cards here to support local buisness, but if you're on a tight budget and building budget or trying to find old cards you're probably better off buying it online.

Service: 5/5
Variety: 4/5
Events: 5/5
Price: 3/5</Text>

The best gaming shop locally. They run multiple Magic events regularly, EDH and modern for sure, new EDH league starting soon.
As a new player to magic it was really disarming when the shop owner offered to help us with a rules clarification and made it clear we were welcome.
The crowd that visits is really friendly, made new friends the first time we showed up.
Come play and support an extremely-deserving local business.

Thanks for the space you create guys, will definitely be back.</Review>

Our Spring Break stay at Marriott Napa Valley Hotel & Spa was wonderful! This was our first family trip in over a year, and the staff and property were all wonderful. Blossom at the front desk was very friendly, enthusiastic, and helpful and left a great first impression upon arrival. The pool was great and the kids had a blast roasting marshmellows at night. I can't wait to come back!<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Stayed with a few friends a month or so ago when we came up to tour some wineries. Great location, nice rooms, and the pool was so cool and relaxing. We were able to easily get picked up and dropped off by Lyft, and had short rides to the wineries and the downtown area for dinners/drinks. Very nice hotel!<//text>< Pics>

The Hotel itself is very beautiful and clean. Blossom at the front desk went above and beyond with my small requests. She really made me feel like a true guest. Emmerson in the bar handled us old ladies very professionally. The pool is chilly, but felt great  for the 88°day. King room was very spacious and clean. Will definitely be back to this property.< /text>

Lovely spot. Easy location to downtown. Pool is super! Rooms are renovated (but beware construction is happening). Staff is friendly. Lots of little extras which are nice.<//review>

As far as the staff most were ok but some were rude
But as far as the services  they were horrible  they walk into your room even though you have a do not disturb sign on the door talk about safety also they are doing construction and all the door slamming just unbearable
I would not recommend this hotel to no one. So many better places for less money
I choose the Marriott because of the standards but in the end I was totally disappointed never again<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< review>
When I was looking for a place to stay in Napa I found the Marriot Hotel and Spa. The front of the hotel has this nice waterfall but that’s it really everything else looked simple. I guess I expected more on the atmosphere and landscape since we were in Napa.

The interior was lovely though. The COVID-19 rules is mandated with masks, hand sanitizer and social distancing. As you walk through the lobby there is a bar at the center and across from was the courtyard which is where the pool is also located. There was a gym and spa but didn’t get to check it out because on the situation and I didn’t ask either of the services were available since we only stayed one night.

The rooms were cute. We asked for a queen bed but we got a double bed. As far as cleanliness... everything seems to be in order but it was dusty. All the furniture had dust. So before we could put out stuff down we had to dust the desks, nightstand, and TV area. I would’ve expected it to be spotless considering COVID at least we came prepared.

Note: we can hear the people on each of our sides. The people were very loud.<//review>

It was clean and the staff were friendly.  Due to Covid, many of the amenities were unavailable (gym, spa, pool, breakfast) but we were still charged the full resort fee.  The shower doors wouldn't stay shut for some reason.<//Review>

<Text>The staff and the hotel was great. Unfortunately the room next door had a party from 2 a.m. Until 5:15 a.m. needless to say after trying to call the front desk by pressing the front desk button on the phone. No one answered. That was the only downfall and made for a long miserable night. The following morning the staff said I should have pressed the 0 button. How was I supposed to know? Especially when there phone has 10 keys on the bottom for different services and one of them was front desk. Judging by the staffs tone they could care less.</Text>< gmapID>

Lovely and cost place... I was here for a conference....the service is excellent. Amenities well-stocked. However the noisy air conditioning is quite irritating  and was a sore point during.my stay. The spa has a large fitness center with all the machines for cardio.</Text>

Excellent stay. Lounging by the pool was awesome. Free pour at 5 pm was a nice touch. We had a first floor parking lot view, but we didn't hear a thing outside or from other rooms. The rooms were nice ans updated. No issues with the room.

The only con, the Preserve Spa was not open for phone calls after 5 pm on a Saturday, even the concierge couldn't get a hold of them.<//text>

A lovely hotel! There are some nice amenities you get that are part of the price and I really recommend doing at least a couple of the options. The snacks throughout the day are nice and the wine in the late afternoon was great. There is a little garden to the side of the hotel the restaurant manager will walk you through. Jerome took us through and he was so nice. The rooms are what you except from any other Marriott.< /Review>

This Marriott is in a great location for exploring Napa. It’s also convenient because there’s a Target, Trader Joe’s and other stores and restaurants nearby.

However, the bathroom has the barn door style door – which means no privacy. It doesn’t block sounds and if you close it too hard, it will slide back open. If you are by yourself, obviously this wouldn’t matter, but if you’re a couple, it might. 

There’s also no view to speak of which other Napa hotels might have. 

Other than that, nice hotel with updated rooms, full bar and a beautiful outside area.</text>

This was the perfect place for us to stay on a couples weekend in Napa Valley! We slept great in the amazing beds! And the rooms are so spacious and modern. We had a wonderful stay and it was so close to so many additional places to eat and grab coffee - but you won't need to leave the resort since they also have all of this here! And the evenings were fantastic on the patio with the fire tables and lounge chairs and live music! We loved our stay here and will definitely return here again!< /text>

< Review>
As a frequent traveling professional and a Marriott Rewards Platinum Elite guest, I was again impressed with level of accommodations and service I have come to expect with Marriott/Bonvoy name. 
When I encountered a minor, temporary inconvenience due to the  Vin Eleven restaurant's kitchen facilities being under construction, the staff was quick to resolve my misgivings and concerns about my evening meal. Despite the hectic schedule of the conferences I attended during my most recent stay, I was able relax and enjoy the ambiance of the Napa Valley wine country thanks to the professionalism of the staff and the comfort afforded by the property.< /Review>

<text>From start to finish we had a poor experience with this hotel. They canceled 2 nights of my 3 night reservation and tried to tell me that I did it and pretty much said sorry about your luck we are overbooked. I had to spend hours on the phone trying to resolve the issue the night before I was supposed to come stay. I was told I would get bonus points for the inconvenience and I still have not gotten them or a return phone call.

Great hotel. Even though Titanium level was placed on ground floor beside elevator....a little noisy.  Will have to second guess staff next time instead of relying on their good judgment. After 20+ years....still have to ensure they make smarter decisions. 🙄< /Review>

Updated with good amenities (modern restaurant, concierge lounge for Elite members, adequate fitness room). Biggest complaint is the resort fee ($20/night) for ridiculous items I didn't use such as local calls, wifi, bicycle use (it was January, no one is riding bikes), outdoor morning yoga (again, January), evening wine tasting (this would've been nice if I could have taken part, but I was at an offsite conference).</review>< pictures>

<text>All the employees were amazing! Super nice and thoughtful. The chef Francisco gave my mom and I a super fun and informative tour of the garden. Our room was spacious. The front desk was able to keep my secret that my sister was flying in to stay with us and surprise my mom on our second night. The concierge lounge was one of my top favorites out of all the Marriotts I’ve stayed at. They have a delicious breakfast selection and some amazing gluten free bread!!!! The only negative I can say was that mom’s bed was less than perfect; there was a stain on her comforter and the mattress was worn down on one side. Other than that, your hotel had a huge impact on the amazing trip I had with my family, and my mom and sister would both agree. Would love to return some day!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The updating on the Marriott was very nice.  Room spacious and comfortable. Great location.  The lobby was comfortable, the outdoor spaces and fire pits were very welcoming.  If you want a hot bath or shower, be prepared for disappointment, but if that is not that important, you won’t be disappointed with this hotel.  The housekeeping staff needs to stay on top of requests like hypoallergenic bedding at check in.  For asthma sufferers, that is an important detail.  I’d stay here again.< /review>

<pics>None</pics><Review>The room itself was fine and the hotel is actually in a pretty decent location for a visit to Napa.  Truthfully, it could be cleaner; for example the brass wall in the elevator was absolutely filthy and covered in dirt and smudges the entire time we were there!  It doesn’t take much for somebody to come in and just wipe it down.  On our final morning there we had to do not disturb sign hanging on our door when we got a loud knock. I got out of bed, tossed on a T-shirt and answered the door to find the maid standing there. When I pointed out to her that we had the do not disturb sign up she told me she saw it and then snipped at me “I just wanna make sure you’re checking out today” while glaring.  Never in my life if I had anything like that happen and I have traveled around the world. We certainly hadn’t  been any trouble to her, as we hadn't asked for anything and we always leave our room very clean. I honestly don’t know what that was about but it left a horrible taste in our mouth, and when we went to complain about it to the front desk they did say they were sorry but that was all they did. So I’m certain she’s still there and she still making guests feel terrible while waking them up.  There are plenty of hotel options in that area so be smart and take your money to someplace where you won’t be treated rudely and disrespected.</Review><Time>1583280000000</Time>< user>

< review>
We stayed at this property from 9/24 through 9/28 during our trip to the wine country. The property itself is what I would refer to as a standard Marriott hotel, which is to say good to very good. However, we just did not have much luck on our stay. The first night the air conditioning was not working, the room temperature was 80 degrees and was super uncomfortable. They did fix it and was fine after that but the AC was very noisy, which is common in many hotels in the US. We stayed in room 1143, which happened to be right across the hall from housekeeping, and every day starting at 6AM there was a ton of activity around our room, including an incessant slamming of doors. We brought this to their attention and the slamming, for the most part, stopped but there was still noise every morning. So if anyone is going to stay at this property, stay away from room 1143 and the vicinity. Also note that between rate, taxes and fees, the average nightly cost of this hotel was almost $500 per night.  Trust me and whether it’s peak season or not, this in no way resembles a $500 per night hotel.  On a positive note, I would say that he staff is courteous and responsive.</review>

This Hotel gets five stars and here's why: This is my first trip the Napa Valley, and I was prepared to "treat" the Boyfriend to a nice resort, with a fabulous pool and spa area, that was in our price range of course. The Napa Valley Marriott fits this bill spot on! After not much research, it's apparent the Napa Valley, and surrounding wine countries are expensive places in which to stay! Finding something I liked that was in our price range, without being TOO crazy, was SLIM pickings. I read the Marriott reviews, and had, like the reviews, a mixed response. From what I researched though, it seemed like a fabulous place that had what we were looking for, and it was SPOT ON! From the moment we arrived, the customer service was simply charming, and so very welcoming. The lobby bar and cozy fireplace area were brimming with happy people sipping wine. The outdoor patio areas with the stylish loungers, fire pits and nightly music was magical. The pool area was perfect after a day out exploring the region, and Marriott's location so close to downtown Napa and many vineyards, was ideal.
If you're headed to Napa Valley, acclimate to your region, accept you'll pay more for less, and appreciate what a magical little resort the Marriott is!<//Review>

Very clean and modern hotel. The staff was also very friendly from the front desk to the cleaning crew. Loved the afternoon wine tasting. Every time I go back to Napa I will be staying at this hotel. Business brought me here but their service will keep me coming back! Thanks< /review>

Staff is not helpful. Please note none of the rooms have queen beds. They are full beds. So forget about having more than 2 people in the room that says is capable of 4. They don’t upgrade for gold bonvoy members apparently. Hotel was empty but they would not accommodate< /Text>

<Text>The hotel itself is up to date and has a great concierge lounge with breakfast, appetizers, and desserts each day. The concierge staff was amazing. Housekeeping did a wonderful job. The gym has a few machines and free weights and is open 24/7, of note it is in the building next to the hotel.

I understand that a hotel can’t control its guests actions, however we had to keep avoiding a hallway due to the stench of cannabis for a few days. My understanding is that Marriott has a smoke free policy for rooms, so this was obnoxious.  Another night the fire alarm went off and it smelled like smoke and took awhile before it was sorted out. The next night someone was repeatedly trying to open a door and it sounded as if they were trying to shoulder into the door for over 5 minutes before I called the front desk. While the staff answered and sent someone up, it was a frustrating  stay due to the hiccups. Perhaps It would be a better experience when it is not busy around the holidays and there are less guests.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>We travel exclusively with Marriott and the associated SPG brands.  If you are expecting Marriott quality, you will be sadly let down. If you are unfortunate enough to be placed on the outside of the hotel you will have flash backs to the old motels of the 60's and 70's where cars shine their lights into your room windows.

Don't think your Marriott status will help you out.  We are titanium and got one of the worst rooms possible. Bottom outside room next the training fields.  They failed to inform us that the Oakland Raiders where having training camp when we booked.  The hallways were noisy until midnight and then we were woken up to Ozzy Osborne Crazy Train and the constant air horn from the football field.

The concierge lounge is a joke.  The Holiday inn Express is better stocked.  Save your money or points and book elsewhere.  We left and went to the Renaissance in Sonoma.  That is a quality lodge.<//text><UserId.>110838971988912093524</UserId.><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeQetTG1eXTJRHZsisWWsSc2Ss7MvJfmqcj1KL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN79TRYgN8vS6c95538u5oJr6hN0qw7jJDrLsYr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObPPKK9IR8UbBftHFFnwyvLrMTQJr71ktY4SB3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2kGrGV1rPkgCasJJ6R0vD7NiXQgw2PT4pc9sp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwVGJHV9UpnL8w7r1tr0CTlr4KWnj6iiK3sS_o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFqBF64G_XhDrPYKYNLQ93H72r0mA9UFT0JUVa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Name>Todd Martin<//Name><Date>1566491313298<//Date>< Resp>

Selected this hotel to use points.  It was a little further from the winery's we wanted to visit but the location was right off the interstate which made for easy access.  The lobby has a lively cocktail hour scene and the concierge room offered appetizers in the evening, a wine machine dispenser  - NEED ONE AT THE HOUSE :)  as well as a fabulous breakfast buffet with outside chef personalising omelets and eggs.  Alfresco dining with outdoor furnaces made this a wonderful start to our day!< /Review>

Full-featured, with large restaurant seating capacity and adjoining coffee alcove, plus outdoor seating with entertainment on selected nights.

<Text>Poor room which was too small. It did not have a mirror other than the bathroom. There was no closet. The patio outside the room was not  well kept with vines and debris. Would not even go out there.  Not enough parking. Had to walk around back with no access. My worst ever Marriott experience and I have stayed at many in my 40 years on the road for business.< /Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Sailing Dirty Martini< /user_name><Time>1571011964009</Time><rating>5</rating><text>This Hotel gets five stars and here's why:  This is my first trip the Napa Valley, and I was prepared to "treat" the Boyfriend to a nice resort, with a fabulous pool and spa area, that was in our price range of course. The Napa Valley Marriott fits this bill spot on! After not much research, it's apparent the Napa Valley, and surrounding wine countries are expensive places in which to stay! Finding something I liked that was in our price range, without being TOO crazy, was SLIM pickings. I read the Marriott reviews, and had, like the reviews, a mixed response.   From what I researched though, it seemed like a fabulous place that had what we were looking for, and it was SPOT ON!  From the moment we arrived, the customer service was simply charming, and so very welcoming.  The lobby bar and cozy fireplace area were brimming with happy people sipping wine. The outdoor patio areas with the stylish loungers, fire pits and nightly music was magical. The pool area was perfect after a day out exploring the region, and Marriott's location so close to downtown Napa and many vineyards, was ideal. <br/>If you're headed to Napa Valley, acclimate to your region, accept you'll pay more for less, and appreciate what a magical little resort the Marriott is!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

When I had called to reserve few days before arrival the response was slow and not appealing, we ended up using another spa and massage  in Napa.

Perfect location for touring Sonoma and Napa Valley‘s. Shedrick, the head bellhop, was the “straw that stirred a drink“. He made everything “go”! Our amenities and provisions were above average. The restaurant bar, VINeleven, was mediocre. Remembering that “you make your own good times“, this was an excellent location.< /text>

<Review>I was delighted to be in Napa for the first time and willing to pay a high price for this hotel, but I was very disappointed to find the small room had small beds, small bathroom and low-cost free water bottles. The hotel doesn't offer many activities or amenities for the nightly rate and resort fee. No outdoor jacuzzi near the pool, restaurant has limited menu and very tight tables and chairs...not warm or inviting.  I felt robbed.<//Review>< pics>

This hotel was so cute and just off the highway. After our wine adventures, we would come back to the hotel and relax by the fireplaces outside. The staff members were amazing and accommodating. One little hiccup we encountered was that we had reserved the 2 double beds with business lounge access and were not permitted to access the lounge. We paid extra for this service via Expedia, upon arrival the front desk explained that the rooms located near the business lounge were newly renovated and therefore were called "Business Lounge Access" but that didn't make any sense to us. We would appreciate if Expedia would update this on their website as it is very misleading (research with the hotel). We ended up overpaying for a service we did not receive.<//Text>

This stay was for my bachelorette trip, and I regret to say that this is probably one of the worst Marriott experience for me so far. Here are a few things that were certainly not up to the standard of the Marriott name: 
1. Upon check-in, the receptionist did not recognize my status, and did not mention anything about amenities or lounge access to me. We had to figure all of these out ourselves later (and wasn't able to enjoy the lounge breakfast the first day because we didn't know it existed). 
2. While the "garden view" room on the website shows a balcony, we got no balcony for our room. There was also no specific "balcony room" that I could have selected when booking. I noticed some other rooms next to us have balconies, and realized that maybe they were given to other guests as an upgrade. The website should reflect the accurate room and if balcony is not a default for garden view, it shouldn't appear under the room category. 
3. The fact that I chose the Marriott brand to celebrate my big day with girl friends and got not even one "congratulation" was disappointing. The hotel knows I was there for my Bachelorette trip because I reached out earlier for some simple decoration, which they declined.  
4. My friend was feeling sick one night and we requested a blanket through the Marriott app, the blanket never came. She woke up sick the next morning. (I will explain more below why we requested via the app and not the phone)
5. When trying to request a late check out, no one responded the massage through the app or picked up my phone. I was put on hold for 30 minutes in the morning and finally did not end up checking out late as we just gave up. 
6. The phone in the room was broken. We can't dial the front desk or room service and I had to dial via my personal phone. When using my personal phone, I continuously got placed on hold and wasn't able to speak with anyone several times. 
I booked Marriott because I used to travel for work and used the brand a lot. It's some of my girlfriends first few times with this brand, and they said they probably will consider booking with other brands after our experience this time.< /Text>

We were celebrating our 14 year anniversary. The hotel was just okay and would not return or recommend. I am a Titanium Marriott member and did not receive an upgrade even though the hotel was at half capacity. I asked one of the concierge and they even mentioned the hotel being half empty because of the coronavirus. So why did I not get an upgrade? The room we did get was noisy. Day and night it had some kind of loud equipment or machine near by that was very disturbing. The bathroom was very outdated. My wife also found a nickel size spider crawling on the ceiling. I don't understand why this hotel is considered a category 7. It should be a 5 or 6 at the most. The best thing about this hotel was the spa. Marriott let me down with this experience and made me highly think twice about only booking with Marriott just to maintain my loyalty membership.<//text>

<Review>Amazing stay in Napa!! Great hotel grounds with lots of amenities including daily happy hour in the evening and coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the mornings. Location is very central between downtown Napa and Yountville. Bed was a little hard for my taste, but not horrible. Had a small issue with the shower, but managment more than made up for it. Highly recommended.< /Review>< pics>

We had a really great time.  We were there during a giant AI convention, so the hotel felt a little crowded or overpacked at certain times during the day - breakfast was almost an hour and a half process one day.  But overall the hotel was still great.<//Text>

<Text>Rooms are modern, but dark. Terrible lighting in the bathroom. Bring your own magnifying mirror and light if you want to put on your makeup and not look like a first-time user. No bathtub/shower combos, (at least in standard rooms), and messy design of sink and soap holders. water goes everywhere and the soap dish doesn't hold soap from easily and frequently escaping. Not a problem for people who are not concerned with keeping the sink area dry and organized. Plenty of towels and the TV is attractively set on a wooden wall that helps to present a comfortable viewing experience. Room was fairly quiet and the beds were comfortable. Service was solid.< /Text>< Pics>

< review>
We went to Napa for a Holiday overnight. We were booked into a nice Garden view room & we had a great day’s experience. We sat near the pool, visited the Concierge lounge for dessert & breakfast & had an enjoyable night cap. 
It was just what I needed after a busy week at the office.< /review>

Check in was at 4. Most places are 3. After checking in at 430, it took them another 30 minutes to figure out what room we were supposed to be in. Makes sense though because we only reserved our rooms 6 months ago. The 2 rooms were supposed to be joining or on the same floor. Surprise surprise...different floors. Ordered French toast from room service...it was $18 and no, the French toast was not made of solid gold for that price...instead it was made of sand; or at least felt/tasted like it. The best part of my stay however, was not having hot water and having to take a frozen shower. When I complained about the hot water, the manager just shrugged it off and said too bad. Didn't realize napa is a 3rd world country. 0/10 would not ever stay here or waste my time or money again.< /Review>

Beautiful hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Stayed for a few nights for a work function and was able to visit some local vineyards and great restaurants. The staff was great and assisted us however we requested and the food was delicious and much better than your typical hotel catering. The rooms themselves were nice and spacious although nothing particularly special. Overall a great venue and hopefully I can come back soon!</Review>

<review>I had a great experience at the Marriott.  My room was quite, the bed comfortable, the pressure on the shower head was strong and having a smart tv was  a plus. the food was very good, with an attentive staff and the concierge really knows her surroundings well. Even thought it was cold outside and daylight, the fire pits were lit and it gave a nice touch to the resort.< /review>< pics>

Terrible customer service with a staff that can’t handle the simplest of tasks. Long story short, this hotel staff takes zero accountability or ownership for poor customer service. Different staff members including a manager have all told me for over a week that a refund has been issued to me and I have yet to receive it. Escalated this along with another to corporate and corporate also dropped the ball. Super frustrating and extremely abysmal experience overall from Marriott. I have zero faith in the customer service experience of Marriott properties and certainly will never stay at the Napa Valley location ever again. I also advise guests to stay elsewhere. The carpets are also musty and smell like mold :)</Text>

I am a SPG member and haven't stayed at Marriott properties much. I didn't realize that the state of Marriott hotels is that bad. Front desk staff was totally untrained and disappeared in the back for 7 minutes during check-in. There was trash everywhere in the courtyard that hasn't been cleaned. The room was small that left very little space because of the king bed. The toilet was installed crooked and the toilet seat even more askew.< /Review>

The hotel is close to downtown Napa as well as all of the Napa Wineries.  Ubers and Lyfts were readily available so you don't have to worry about sampling the wines and driving or paying for an expensive car service.  You could get pretty much anywhere in 20 minutes or less during our time there which was "off season".  They also offer bikes during your stay if you would rather bike the wine trail. The room was great and very comfortable, but there wasn't a bath tub (if that is important to you).  I assume it has to do with water conservation in California, but I could be wrong.  The staff is friendly and they have a great spa/work out facility.  In addition, there are table fireplaces out back to lounge around on a cool night with a glass of wine.<//Text>

<text>I travel extensively for business and I've tried to stay loyal to the Marriott brand throughout. This has given me the opportunity to frequent a number of different Marriott chains. This trip was for pleasure during a long weekend, the property was in a convenient location. Napa is beautiful and can be a great getaway. If you're going to explore wineries still expect the need to drive to those locations (possibly up to an hour away). 

Amenities at the hotel are standard but some basic expectations were lacking. First room we checked into had some abnormal noise coming from the HVAC, I never call to switch rooms I usually just deal with it but since I was traveling with my wife I wanted to make sure her experience was positive. The next room was quieter but the air conditioning wasn't very effective ended up sleeping hot the rest of the trip. Spa services were a bit overpriced but high quality for the massage package. We only ate dinner at the hotel one night and it was a positive experience along with very prompt wait staff. 

I don't necessarily care to have my status recognized or to be treated specially in any way, however I have noticed after the recent mergers and acquisitions of Marriott brands the consistency of elite experience seems to have declined.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>The area is central to Napa. The facilities are average and the public spaces as well as hotel rooms need an update. Resort fee is unacceptable, particularly for the amenities that are there. Marriott needs To get rid of these resort fees included in their stay. If they want to be five-star hotel, they shouldn’t be charging for what would be considered requisite facilities<//review></record>

The staff was very helpful and the food at the hotel restaurant is quite good.  In my opinion, the location leaves much to be desired, but my stay was more about convenience (proximity to the airport) more so than it was the perfect location.

I’ve stayed at many Marriotts and Hilton’s - to me, this hotel is overpriced for what it is.  That’s just my opinion.<//Review><userid>108211180180978041349</userid></record>

<Review>Hotel staff was always friendly and attentive. Hotel rooms are clean, updated and overall very comfortable but lighting could be better as the room did not get a ton of natural light. The common areas - hotel restaurant, outdoor seating, pool area - were all comfortable and well kept with good space for all guests. We stayed here for a wedding and it was the perfect location for large groups to be able to gather together and relax. We stayed here for the group rate, but come to Napa often and I would certainly stay here again because it's also convenient to other Napa towns - Yountville, St. Helena, Sonoma, etc.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80850720b5ae9e1f:0xe90d4170a8689308</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Spent the weekend in Napa for our anniversary. We really enjoyed the hotel and spa. Very beautiful and lively atmosphere. The bar area was a great. Room location was disappointing, very noisy and distracting.< /Text>

The facilities are clean and modern and rooms are comfortable.  Really enjoyed the lounge for a quick breakfast and the complimentary wine tasting from 5-6 in the bar area.  Lunch at the restaurant is always good.  Look forward to returning to the Napa Marriott on my next visit to Napa.<//text>< GmapID>

< review>
We’ve stayed at this hotel twice now. The first time (October 2018) was uneventful, although I called concierge before we arrived to ask them to do something nice to our room for my husbands birthday (a bottle of wine or something). They didn’t do anything. The second time we stayed here (August 2019) we were thoroughly disappointed. The first room we checked into was dirty and the front desk person was not apologetic at all. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are seriously hard to move around in. The carpet in the elevator and hallways is really old and kind of gross. The concierge lounge is nice but gets packed which can be frustrating. Also, the hot tub is part of the spa and closes super early... so we couldn’t use it to relax in after wine tasting all day. Our friends had an overflowing toilet and it took maintenance over 30 minutes to come to their room. Their smoke detector also went off on two different occasions which was really inconvenient. If we weren’t severely loyal Marriott members, we would not have stayed here. Even with the outdated amenities, the service you would expect to have at a hotel in a price point like this is seriously lacking.< /review>

Marriott at Napa Valley is a great place to stay.  Clean and comfortable rooms.  Restaurant on site is great - but there are also plenty of other stores and restaurants nearby for families to choose from.  Staff are all friendly and helpful.< /Review>

<review>Lovely hotel, mixed experience with service. Food was very good! Staff was helpful to appoint but some were ill informed. 
Billing and room size are the biggest problems here. Not appropriate for a group as the rooms are very very small. Queen beds are really full size.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The Marriott Hotel is located very well in the middle of many Vine yards at Napa. You are perfect located and close to downtown. The Food and Pool is great, the rooms are great and big. The Service is awesome. The "Spa" means the Pool - so could be much better/more. Good conference rooms and great for a convention. Food and drinks were excellent.< /Review>

When we arrived we could tell that it was a renovated old hotel that was on a very busy street and train tracks that trains were constantly going down. The fact that there was a $20 a day resort "amenity" fee was well hidden on the website and covered items that you probably don't want. Wifi that was spotty at best, coffee in the morning at the restaurant that you will either need to buy an overpriced breakfast or tip to get. We made a point of coming back to try the 5-6pm wine tasting that offered a splash of mediocre wine - disappointing after enjoying the great food and wines all day that Napa Valley offers. The rooms were OK but you could tell that the construction was not up to the usual Marriott standards. There are much better options in teh Napa Valley to stay at - we'll be choosing them on our next visit.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80850720b5ae9e1f:0xe90d4170a8689308< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

this was probably our 5th or 6th stay here and we have always been pleased.  The staff is warm and receptive, always ready to handle any request quickly and efficiently.  I attended a conference on the property and had time for wine tasting and two mornings in the spa. The hotel offers free wine tasting each evening.  Rooms are comfortable and spacious.  Looking forward to returning again.< /review>

<Review>The property itself is a little more on the basic side, but everything is very nice and the rooms are good. The food and outdoor space was average. What made this perfect for us was the location. Being at the south end of the valley, we could go easily go north into the country, or quickly head over to Carneros or Sonoma.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1570059611089, 'text': 'Thank you for your positive feedback.

My wife and I planned a vacation in California to celebrate our anniversary, and decided to go with the Napa Valley Marriott Rails and Relaxation package. We booked through the Bonvoy App a month before the event. 
We checked in for our 2-night stay and immediately requested to have more information on the Wine Train package (e.g. where do we get tickets? was there a shuttle to the Wine train? were there upgrade options available? etc.). We were informed by the associate checking us in that we were all set and all we needed to do was show up at the train station and inform them we were with the hotel; If we required more information the concierge would be available the next morning to assist. This turned out to be a complete misinformation.
The next morning, after much back and forth with the concierge, it was finally revealed that additional booking was required, which had not been done. She then called the Wine Train and informed us during the conversation that the lunch package was sold out, and if we wanted to partake in the dinner option for that day we would have to pay full price (over $300 each!). Our only option was to take the tour the next day, which we finally acquiesced to. 
Overall, we felt there was just a serious lack of knowledge regarding the Rails and Relaxation package amongst the staff. Case in point: we later found out that the package we had booked through the hotel was actually the dinner package.
On a positive note, the manager did help quite a bit by offering ways to compensate us for our troubles. Otherwise the rating for this review would definitely have been "Poor".<//review>

I stayed at the Napa Valley Marriott Hotel & Spa during an educators' conference and had a great experience. The front desk clerks who checked us in late at night were friendly and efficient. The staff at the in-house bar were very knowledgeable about their offerings, as were the staff who served at conference receptions. The food served for breakfast and lunch at the conference was delicious.

I am a nursing mother and was worried about pumping and transporting milk while away from my child. The staff was very helpful in storing milk for me so that it could be frozen for my plane trip home and an employee named Shedrick was especially helpful, going above and beyond by finding me a room to use to make sure I was ready to travel after I had already checked out of the hotel.</review>

<review>Just had a great stay at the Napa Valley Marriott Hotel & Spa. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern (with lots of places to plug in your devices). The front-desk staff are friendly and helpful. The concierge had lots of great ideas for wine tasting, and was able to make last-minute arrangements for a private tasting at a wonderful nearby vineyard (Caldwell) as well as reservations at the top-rated steakhouse in the area (but if you're from NYC, don't bother with the steakhouse--you're sure to be disappointed). The hotel is convenient to a host of Napa wineries and vineyards--both the world-renowned, and the lesser-known.

The morning yoga sessions were the perfect way to work out the kinks from a seven-hour flight. And the spa was convenient, relaxing and reasonably priced (though they could benefit from adding a dry sauna, in addition to the whirlpool and steam room that they offer).

Next time, we'll come in the summer so that we can enjoy the private patio by our room, outdoor yoga and the pool.

My thanks to management and staff for a wonderful vacation!<//review>< pics>

At check-in, we were warmly welcomed. It was an anniversary get-away and the woman who checked us in recognized our anniversary. She offered us a bottle of wine and either a cheese plate or a fruit plate. (we chose the cheese plate) We talked about the type of wine we'd like since I am a wine maker. The check-in was a pleasant experience, however, neither the wine nor the cheese ever made it to our room.
The room was nicely decorated however there was no privacy. Cars parked immediately outside the window caused us to keep the blinds closed all of the time. A very "motel" experience.
On the second night, we decided to eat at the hotel's dining room. No one came to our table until I went up to the bar to ask if they were still serving dinner. Being told they were, someone finally came by. The couple at the table next to us had to cancel their order because it took too long to arrive. The waiter told us that there was a $20 corkage fee on the wine I brought and asked if it was ok. I told him no. There was a magazine in our room that listed the corkage fee at this restaurant as $0, and we had an appetizer the day before with no fee. He said he would check with the manager. He never came back.
Lastly, I was awoken in the middle of the night by the sound of water dripping. It was actually coming out of the ceiling in the bath room. Reporting it to the front desk got us relocated to another room. We were offered mimosas and breakfast for our trouble. Never happened.
My experience was not what I expect from a Marriott. Very disappointed.<//Text>

Looking for a central spot to enjoy the Valley and relax too? This is the place. The spa services were amazing and the wine was wonderful. Take the garden tour with a glass of wine and enjoy learning about the vegatables the hotels uses.<//text>

The NAPA Marriott is centrally located, the parking and access to the rooms is great, but most of all the people at this hotel are awesome! Very helpful, very friendly always willing to help- I highly recommend this hotel for wine country visits< /Text>

<text>It's been 5 years since my last visit to the hotel. Room is newly renovated. Checkin was smooth through the Elite line. It was my birthday so I got several greetings and wishes to my birthday from the hotel staff. The wine delivered to my room was really good! Sorry I forgot the gentleman's name who was at the front desk Elite line on 6/16 afternoon. It's always been good staying with Marriott hotels. I always see customer obsession from details. I'll definitely come back again next time. 

One thing on the downside though, the body lotion in my room seemed to be a used one. The lid looked opened before, and the top line of the lotion was not a clean straight line. Although it might still be a new one just looking like a used one, I'd suggest housekeeping pay extra attentions to avoid this type of concerns.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>A nice Hotel for a vacation in Napa Valley.
The staff is super friendly and helpful.
My room was very clean, quiet and had a good size.
I enjoyed the outside seating arrangements.
The location of the hotel is great for you to explore the area.< /Review><response>{'time': 1535414324026, 'text': 'Great Marc, hope to see you in the future for a return visit!'}</response>< rating>

I commend this hotel for providing exceptional service, updated property and guest rooms, and attention to detail. From check-in to check-out, the process was smooth and enjoyable. The concierge, Karina was incredibly helpful and nice -- even sending a birthday surprise to my room while I was out. Check in agents were awesome and wished me a happy birthday. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Don't bother looking for other hotels, just book this one. You will not be disappointed. Keep up the great job!<//text>

Two free cups of coffee as well as a free wine pouring every evening and you can go back up and get as many glasses of wine as you wish. Staff was very pleasant. They also have free parking although the parking lot gets crowded very early and sometimes you have to look for a spot in the back of the building but there are plenty of spots. This hotel is very close to many places to eat. They also have free bike rentals which is cool if you're in the mood to take a ride on a bike and if you are the amenities that I didn't partake of overall it's a pretty good stay for the price.</review></record>

We are currently staying as guests through a  company that is sponsoring the nascar event and so far have been unimpressed. The tiny cooler in our smallish room is not functioning; the room is adequate, but cannot be referred to as "nice" by any stretch; and the toilet is either dirty, even after being serviced by the hospitality crew, or just stained a weird, brownish color. I would definitely have expected much more and would not purposefully choose these accommodations in the future.< /Text>

The property is beautiful and well maintained. Rooms are beautiful and comfortable. Food and bar service are excellent. Bell staff very friendly and efficient. Front desk staff and Concierge need ALOT of work, as such it takes awhile to appreciate the property and its positive attributes after a horrible check in experience.</Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>I have stayed in many different hotels across the country and I believe this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. From a customer service standpoint as well as room satisfaction. I booked my reservation months prior over the phone. The reservation specialist who helped me never specified double or king beds over the phone and to be quite honest I didn't really think about it at the time. When we arrived to check in and were given a room I realized that we had been booked for 2 doubles instead of a King and I asked the front desk to please move us to another room with a king. "so sorry we cannot help you all rooms are booked" I told them I would pay more money for an upgraded room, it did not matter just to please get me and my husband into a room with King. "So sorry nothing we can do" Out first trip just the two of us in over two years and we were sleeping in separate beds....Beyond upset. I told the gentleman at the front desk to please let me know if anything opened up the next day as we were there for 3 nights. I checked back every day and nothing. Friends of ours checking in the next day were shown to their room, had to go back to the front desk as the room they were given had not yet been cleaned and the front desk person was very apologetic and upgraded them to a suite...ON THE SPOT. When I had been begging the past 2 days and was assured if anything opened up they would give me the room. I offered to PAY THE EXTRA MONEY and I watched our friends get upgraded in front of my very eyes for FREE. We had tasting reservations so I had no time to stay and fight nor did I want to cause a scene in the middle of the hotel lobby and let this ruin yet another day. I called the hotel to try and get through to a manager and after being on hold for almost 30 minutes I gave up. I have never been so mad and so dissatisfied from a customer service standpoint. Not to mention our room that we did get stuck with was nowhere near our standards. The shower did not drain correctly so we were standing in about a foot of our own filthy water every time we showered, and the room was just small. I wanted to move beyond this horrible experience but have been getting flooded with emails to leave a review so here it is. I will never stay at a Marriott ever again. And now that I have written this review it will be going up on multiple sites. Thank you for 100% neglecting me during my stay.< /review>< userid>

<Text>We had delightful stay in this hotel.  We liked its location.  Close to some local dining spots.  A short drive to downtown Napa.  As a runner, there were nearby bike trails to take advantage of.  We enjoyed the free coffee in the morning and people watching in the lobby or the courtyard.  The rooms were nice and clean.  Very convenient to attend my meeting and rest in the hotel room a short walk away.  Would consider staying here again!< /Text><Date>1521504000000<//Date><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80850720b5ae9e1f:0xe90d4170a8689308< /gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

Another excellent stay at the Napa Valley Marriott. Always friendly staff that even comped me access to the Concierge Lounge though my Marriott status doesn't include it. The staff also did a great job considering half the hotel was occupied by the Oakland Raiders during their training camp. My only regret is not taking advantage of some of the other amenities they offer.</review>

4th***UPDATE***

The dishes I had in room last night are STILL outside of the door.....WOW!!! I  left here at 8 am (with the dishes in room) and returned to the room at 8:06 PM to find dishes outside of the door. Again, goes to show and prove that's it's not me!

3rd ****UPDATE****(Spoiler Alert: GM never contacted me after I emailed him , sic'd two of his staff -Amber and Cheryl- on me when I went to the front desk and requested to speak to him after not receiving a response from him)

Good evening Mr. (Chad) Cuddy:

Thank you for sending Cheryl and Amber out to speak with me. The ladies mdae it abundantly clear that the hotels obligation to me was to solely and only remove the hair from the shower and not completely clean the shower. Ms. Amber stated that she did know what else she was supposed to do (with a very unpleasant and unprofessional facial expression). Obviously at the point both ladies came out and the body language exhibited that there would be NO assistance provided. So, I decided to walk away because well, I'm an adult and will not be / or will not allow any one to attempt to intimidate me. (Good try though). I did mention that it was time for me to contact my credit card issuer to see if they can communicate better with you. And, as always I filed another complaint with Marriott Corp. Hopefully, they will have someone who will take this seriously.

The Napa Marriott has not held up its end of its contract with me as: (a) a Platinum Elite Member, (b) a paying customer / human being.

2nd ****UPDATE**** (Spoiler Alert: There's STILL hair in shower)

Okay, so I returned to my room after a long day at my worksite and (drum roll, please) there was still hair in the shower - one more additional hair than what was there this morning (yeah!) After posting, I did call the Platinum Elite 800 number and they informed me that all they would do is call into the hotel and ask to have the shower cleaned. So, the representative told me I would be better off going down to the front desk- with the first two pictures - and alerting the front desk. Which I did. I was assured that the shower would be cleaned. And to the credit of housekeeping,  it does appear to have been cleaned with regard to the grout. However, there is still hair in the shower. If it were mine, I would not complain.  But, and alas, it is not my hair. I've added three more pictures to support my claim.

Additionally,  before I came to my room, I did stop at the front desk and appraised Rob of what happened. He did some checking and told me the issue had been taken care of. Unfortunately,  it was not. So, this will be my last stay at the location. And, I explained to housekeeping that I would be putting a towel down in the shower in order to shower from here on out. Nobody wants to smell stinky especially when having business meeting, right?
-----------
Here now and I went to take a shower this morning and found hair in the shower. To point out the obvious,  it is not my hair. Additionally, the shower itself does not appear to have been fully cleaned, with an actual cleaner in quite awhile. So, I was reduced to having to wash up in the sink. EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED and DISAPPOINTED. Will be contact the Platinum Elite 800 customer service line for assistance.</text>

<Review>The Napa Marriott is a signature property in a fabulous location. Its central location in downtown Napa makes for a very convenient access to the entire Napa Valley. The hotel staff was outstanding especially the Housekeeping Staff. A heartfelt thank you to the Housekeeping staff for making out stay memorable.

<username>kazuki nakamura< /username><pics>None</pics><text>I think the hotel would have higher ratings if they didn't call themselves a Marriott or a Spa. It's neither. Altho the service was excellent the property is not. IMO they should be renamed to Courtside by Marriott. Anyway if you are a light sleeper this place is not for you. You can hear the doors closing. And housekeeping kept trying to enter the room when I had late checkout and a privacy sign up.</text></record></dataset><record>

Very nice room EXCEPT for a bathroom door that wouldn’t shut, no hooks or towel racks in the bathroom.   Impossible to sleep in because of the noise from a soccer field behind the hotel.   Restaurant ran out of Club Soda!!!  How does that happen?  Don’t order The Caesar Salad, it had no flavor.  Don’t waste your money on the Concierge Rooms.  The lounge was packed, noisy and unless you’re in love with deep fried food, inedible.  They also we’re constantly out of bottled water.  The hallways to the rooms had food service items and wine bottles littering the hallways.  We stayed here in 2014 and it was wonderful.  What happened???< /Review>

<Review>Overall, another good stay at Marriott. I was in town for work and didn't take advantage of any of the wine related events or opportunities, although they did have that available daily.

Check-in was easy and thank you to Rob for the extra consideration for the gold level membership. It's unusual to receive something without specifically asking for it and that was a nice start to the stay. That said, I had to park on the opposite side of the hotel just to find parking. There was a convention of some sort going on so parking was somewhat competitive at times.

I stayed in an ADA room so the pictures posted may vary from what you see. The far glass doors open onto a small patio area surrounded by foliage instead of a fence, which was different but nice. I saw other reviews mentioning dated decor or condition but I didn't have any complaints for my room. The only issue I had was with what I think was an educator's convention who had some rowdy participants.

The concierge lounge was ok, nothing amazing. They have fairly low volume through there so manage your expectations accordingly. Some of the evening appetizers were delicious though. I had dinner at the restaurant one night and also visited the coffee bar once. Both were good but nothing amazing.

Overall, this was another solidly good stay. My only complaint was with the convention goers and there's not much the property can do about that.<//Review><userid>116638948986269775718<//userid><Rating>4<//Rating><gmapID>0x80850720b5ae9e1f:0xe90d4170a8689308< /gmapID><Name>Jordan Elder</Name><Pics>None</Pics><date>1542918314306<//date></record>

<Review>Recently, one of the nation's largest conservation organizations held its board of director's meeting at this hotel.
From the warm greeting and load-in assistance from Shedrick at the front door, to the entire  food and beverage staff, we were impressed by the quality and thoughtfulness of the Marriott Team.
Truly some of the finest hotel food our group has experienced. The daily wine tasting in the lobby at 5:00 p.m. was a great touch.
The recent upgrades at the hotel are outstanding. Free parking was much appreciated.< /Review>< pics>

We kept getting lost (maybe color coding halls or the parking lot would help?).

Napa Marriott is set on a busy street but once inside you know you are in a Marriott resort. There is plenty of convenient parking, the staff is outstanding as are the amenities. Centrally located in Napa with a concierge who can help you enjoy the areas many wineries, it is an excellent place which I plan to continue to use as a base when visiting Napa. Do not overlook the the complementary bike usage. High end cross over bikes provided with bike bags, locks, and helmets. There are outstanding places to ride once you travel a few short miles away from the hotel's busy street. The restaurant is also excellent although the options are fairly standard. My second stay and still one of my two favorite Marriott's.</text>

When this Marriott is finished being upgraded it will be great, but it is undergoing renovations and there is lots of construction. The location is convenient to downtown and wineries but it may be noisy until renovations are complete.<//review>

We stayed here for a bachelorette party and it was great! Everything was very clean and the staff was all helpful and nice. Everything was busy because the college football championship was in town and even though the place was packed,  the staff was great and handled it like professionals. I would highly suggest stating here<//Review>

This is a high quality hotel, excellent for a short visit to   Napa and Sonoma valleys.
We stayed only one night and were sorry that could stay longer. We had a room overlooking the inside garden, so it was very quiet, but a bit dark. The staff was very attentive and responsive to all our requests. Overall we enjoyed very mych our stay at Napa Marriott.<//text>

Very disappointed.  We stay at Marriotts all over the country and this might have been the worst.  The bed was so hard it felt like sleeping on a table.  We asked about getting moved to a different room and told we could get points.  Points don’t correct the issue.  Instead, we were provided a foam topper that had black marks up and down it.

We were told this is the new mattress for the company.  We sincerely hope that is not true.  I can’t believe that because we stayed at a Westin in SFO, significantly cheaper, and it was amazing.

Next trip to Napa, we will find a different place to stay.</Text>

We spent the weekend here while we toured the surrounding Napa wineries and restaurants. The hotel's design with an interior garden and pool area was really pleasant - our ground floor room had sliding doors leading to a patio with comfortable chairs that overlooked the beautiful shady garden and pool. You really did not need to leave the hotel to have a lovely relaxing stay - it has everything you need, but the temptations of Napa and its wineries and restaurants did pull us away. The location is perfect.  Very comfortable rooms plus they have internet TV which makes it easy to relax and watch your favorite Netflix show or listen to Pandora.  Loved our stay.< /Review>

<text>I love staying at Marriott's and the Napa location was no exeception. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff was great. The bar area was more than I expected, the food and drinks were good. The pool area was lovely and we used the hot tub which was very nice. They have firepits by the pool which was wonderful after a long day of wine tasting, we were able to come back the hotel and relax without having to be in our room. This property is great and within about 10 miles of some really great wineries.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I loved the modern design and style of the inside of the hotel.  I was shocked after being unimpressed by the outside to see how nice it was on the inside.  The room had stylish decor, was comfortable, clean and a great size (I upgraded to a larger room).  The bar had great energy and the wine happy hour was both informative and entertaining.  The concierge lounge also offered wine tasting and had snacks and drinks.  All of the staff members were friendly and helpful.  The hotel is centrally located to restaurants and shopping.</Text>

The renovations to the hotel room are amazing.  I was on the first floor and it was very comfortable to sit outside in the morning in comfortable seating and enjoy my coffee.  The grounds are beautifully groomed, peaceful and enjoyable.   The use of the Marriott mobile app makes it a snap to check-into the hotel.  I was able to provide a time that I was arriving and my room was ready for me.   This feature definitely beats the "standard" check-in time restrictions at most hotels.</Text>

Redwood Grove was very nice area for dinner, but the front desk should learn where it is so guests don't have to wander around looking... Meeting rooms are adequate but screen was small and projector was not well calibrated. Room was great and resort looks nice.< /Review>

Very odd layout, had to walk far to room, you may get luckier than I did. The walls are thin, thin enough to hear a couple next door having intercourse. Hotel itself was clean and offers nice amenities: spa, fitness center, lounge with live music and happy hour. The crowd here is older couples and family. Obviously prime location for visiting the vineyards in Napa. Price was fairly expensive for a place that was lacking in a few categories, but you pay for the location. Next time I'll be trying a different place to see if I could get more value for my money.<//Review>

Hotel staff was very nice. Two bars of soap instead of one bar in the bathroom would be helpfull. One at the sink and one in the shower. The hotel room was somwhat beat up and needed some repairs. Lighting in the room was fair and could have definitely been better.</text>

The Napa valley Marriott is awesome! The staff is friendly and the location is very close to wine country and downtown. It does not feel like a behemoth hotel, and the staff and service are both excellent. The property is well maintained and the people actually seem like they want to be at work: they own the service they provide. I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a getaway.
Give the restaurant a try - it looks out of place, but the food was amazing!</review>

A good hotel, recently renewed. Rooms are nice and comfortable. Only disadvantage is that half of the rooms look into the parking spot, making it difficult to leave curtains open.< /review>

I again had the opportunity to stay at the Napa Valley Marriott and Spa. I am a Marriott Rewards Member and as always, was treated as if I were a VIP or dignitary. Although, due to scheduling constraints, I did not have the opportunity to enjoy all the amenities offered by this premier property as in past visits, the experience was once again a superlative experience. 

The staff was most accommodating, everyone greeting me with a smile. Because of my compressed schedule, I did not have time to enjoy the spa this visit. Again, because of time constraints precluding my customary visiting of downtown Napa, I had the opportunity to dine in the VINeleven restaurant and bar. I was most pleasantly surprised by the outstanding food and service. The wine tasting buffet in the evening was befitting the Napa Valley. My meal there was an awesome experience. The food preparation and presentation was excellent. My palate was greeted with piquant savor and the staff's suggested wine pairing was perfect. 
I would highly recommend this property to anyone or group visiting the Napa Valley.</text>

We enjoyed our first visit in Napa at this Marriott.  The bar area was very nice, beautiful pool and patio.  Our upgraded room was lovely and first rate bathroom.  The bed was WONDERFUL along with the staff.  

We took advantage of the bike rentals (included with our stay) and LOVED that it was on the bike path across the street.

Inquire about shuttle service to downtown.  We had a rental car and it is needed to get to the downtown area for restaurants and shopping.  

Very pleased and everyone should consider this location on their visit to Napa.<//Review>

<text>Hotel was very nice but be sure the check-in person tells you about all of the facilities and perks available.  For instance, every night in the lobby they have FREE wine tasting, with snacks, apparently from a different vineyard each night.  I was never told about this and got back to the hotel after they stopped serving each night.  Never found out about it until I was checking out. Staff was great. Place looked great.  Room was large and bed was very comfortable.  Had some firm pillows on the bed.  (Many Marriotts have these super soft pillows that offer your head no support.  If you sleep on your side you feel like your mouth will soon be eating the pillow; as your head sinks down to the level of the bed and the pillow engulfs your face.)  Internet was not always available but was fast when it worked.   I'd rate the hotel a perfect 10 if I knew about the free wine tasting.<//text>< Rating>

Visited on a Sunday afternoon recently. Nice looking place with nice bar and patio to relax and converse without all the noise and distractions of other packed bars. The appetizers were very good and the service was perfect. Exec. Chef Brian has established and maintained a really good team. Enjoy!< /text>

Old dog, new decore does not fix an ancient facility with substandard rooms.  Needs complete tear down. Stay at the springhill suites instead.  SPA facilities close at 6 pm.  Minimal spa service menu.  Services performed well.  Fitness facilities roomy include shower, hot tub, and steam room excellent and working.<//Text>

I came two years to a conference at the hotel and coming back again, it has been an even more enjoyable experience. It seems as if they have gone through a pretty extensive renovation to a more modern decor. The staff and atmosphere are very pleasant and I look forward to the rest of my time here and returning in the future.< /Text>

We had a great time celebrating our 20th anniversary.   The location was great for wineries during the day and a shuttle to downtown restaurants for dinner.  We utilized the fitness center and spa to replenish in the mornings.  We ate dinner one night at the lobby bar which was great.  They had a wine tasting in the lobby each night before Dinner from some great wineries.< /Text>

This Napa Marriott hotel is well located. The sheets and bed gave me the best sleep. Parking was limited but ok. I would recommend this hotel.</text>

< Review>
The Napa Valley Marriott is conveniently located for vineyards in both Napa and Sonoma Valleys. The staff was outstanding. The pool is a bit small but nice. The town of Napa as well as several very nice vineyards are within biking distance of the hotel. The concierge lounge provided a lovely breakfast as well as snacks, drinks and appetizers throughout the day. The hotel had also organized some lovely wine tastings each evening so we could sample wine and make decisions as to which vineyards we wanted to visit the next day. The rooms were clean. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Napa Valley Marriott and would definitely return in the future.</Review>

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Marriott in Napa during our Weekend to Remember conference. It was wonderful not have everything needed in house so that we didn't need to leave the facility. The food at the restaurant was wonderful but priced a bit to high, we thought. The room was clean and spacious - very relaxing in every way.< /Text>

< Review>
The staff at the Marriott Napa Valley were a cut above the rest in terms of friendliness, attention to detail, and insight into the needs of the customer. I had a very long travel day getting out to Napa due to airline travel delays and wasn't in too cheerful of a mood by the time I made it to the property. However, the welcome I received at the desk and the great service I received the entire trip is something i will remember the next time I come to the area. I found the overall property to be modern and inviting. The lobby and bar area are open, and conducive to getting into the mood of the area. The exterior areas of the hotel are well maintained and are in line with the Napa Valley area. Minutes from other good restaurants in the area and convenient to the many wineries which the area is known for. I highly recommend this property.</Review>

Marriott member and this is generally the only hotel we stay at. This vacation we stayed at 3 Marriott's in a row.  This was the best run, cleanest and friendliest of them all.  Rooms are large and we had a balcony over the garden with a pool view.  Gym is nice, has a good amount of cardio equipment with free weights and weighted machines.  The grow their own produce from the on-site garden and use it in the restaurant. Great selection of wines.  Located in a perfect place. About 10 minutes to downtown Napa and 15 min or less to the beginning of the Napa vineyards/wineries.  It is very quiet and safe.  Best sleep we had all vacation was here...<//text>

<time>1490745600000</time><Rate>None<//Rate><Text>Upon booking, I called the hotel and requested an upgrade seeing as I am a platinum elite member, but more importantly because I was spending my birthday at the hotel. Having spent a few previous birthdays at both Marriott and non-Marriott hotels, I was hoping for *some* kind of special treatment or upgrade and the person who took my call said that they'd be happy to do so and specifically told me that my visit would be memorable.
Upon checking in, I got pretty much the same room I had booked, no upgrade, no special treatment and no mention of any birthday at all. If the person whom I spoke with earlier had indeed made a note about it being my birthday, then the person who checked us in didn't even bother to wish me a happy birthday. On top of that, the heated pool - which my wife had specifically enquired about prior to us booking - wasn't very heated so our kids had a less than stellar stay.
That being said, we didn't make any fuss about it during our stay and figured that next year we'd chose another hotel brand at another location. But upon checking out, I was asked how our stay had been and I told the lady at the front desk the above story - and she then surprised me by telling me that she would reimburse the points I had paid the hotel room with. I was stunned and told her that it had not been my intention to ask for such a thing, when telling her about how we felt about our stay. But she insisted and also took the time to wish me a happy birthday, although belated, and I left the hotel feeling a bit better about the whole thing. Now, a week later those reimbursed points have yet to show up on my account, so I guess that I shouldn't have been so quick to reinvest any confidence in the hotel. The semi-good feeling I had efter the checkout is pretty much gone and this is reflected in my feedback and any reviews posted online regarding my stay. I feel like I have been fooled twice by the hotel - first with regard to any special treatment for my birthday and second with regard to the promise of a points refund. Very poorly handled by the hotel and reflects very negatively on the Marriott brand.< /Text>< username>

We left stranded by another local hotel that over booked their rooms. That hotel contacted the Marriott and together they got us a great room and turned a bad experience into a good experience. The Marriott turned out to be a nicer property than the other hotel so it worked out great in the end.< /review>

Great hotel with a good location in Napa Valley. There was a lot of parking around the hotel, but it may not be close to your room. Free Wi-Fi, gym access is 24 hours, spa facilities are separated by sex and are clean. Very pretty outdoor seating area (with fire pits) and an outdoor swimming pool (which closes at dark). Rooms were a good size, but the bathroom doors didn't lock. Overall, would definitely go back and stay again.<//review>

Concierge lounge was fantastic and the wine tastings were most enjoyable.  I wish we had the time to extend our stay and utilize the spa facilities.<//text>

<Review>Stayed at the Spa wing, with access to the concierge lounge.  The usual great standards which you would expect from the Marriott.  Great finishing, great amenities.  Nice feature was the wine tasting event and bicycles for rent.  

Overall a very pleasant experience.  Hotel seemed busy and under-staffed on the downside.  Not enough attention from the staff in general, ranging from check-in to concierge.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The hotel can be a bit sprawling, with some rooms located a good distance from the front desk / bar area. My room was newly done and looked very fresh and modern with sliding doors out to, what will be, a garden area and onto the pool. Location was decent. Not worth the headache. I would definitely choose this property again for future stays.</review>

<Text>We stayed at the Napa Valley Marriott for 6 days and 5 nights and from the second we checked in to the second we left it was perfection. The entire staff, from our wonderful Brandy at the front desk, to Domique concierge to Tim in the restaurant and even Shedrick the bellman was excellent and went above and beyond for our every need. They were all very knowledgable about all the wineries and restaurants in the area as well as very accomodating for our needs at the hotel. They mentioned an upcoming renovation and once that is accomplished I can't see how they could get any better. They were the first Marriott, and we have stayed in many, we are platinum elite memebers, who totally fullfilled the platinum "perks" with no questions asked. Not only did they treat us well but from talking with other guests, they were treated the same way whether they were platinum or not. The concierge lounge was open every day and the food was great as well as the service. We loved the evening wine tasting at the hotel and the Vin 11 resturant had delicious food. I will definately be staying again next year. Use the concierge service because they really know there stuff.< /Text><Rating>None</Rating>< username>

<Review>Upon entering the Marriot Hotel and Spa we were greeted by the wonderfully friendly Shedrick. Angel, who had our rooms at the ready (even though we were two (2) hours early) was friendly, knowledgeable, and an absolute doll!! She lived up to her name!! The only recommendation I would make is to schedule your spa necessities as soon as you arrive for the hours are extremely limited and fill up quickly.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<date>1518998400000< /date><Rating>None<//Rating><text>Hotel was beautifully updated, rooms were clean and comfortable.  Staff was very helpful, friendly and pleasant.  Two drawbacks for us personally were:  No ability to grab a quick snack or coffee during evening breaks from the conference.  The little market onsite was closed and the bar became inundated as we all lined up desperate for some coffee to keep us going.  Second drawback was our room.  We were given a handicap accessible room even though it wasn’t requested or needed.  It was fine with the exception of the lack of hanging space for clothing and the accessible shower sprayed water all over the bathroom floor, despite a closed shower curtain.  This made for a very slippery floor and required lots of mopping up after each shower.  Minor flaws in our stay for sure, but just something to be aware of.<//text>< Pics>

The lobby and room were great.  The bar was lively and booming each night.  The service at the restaurant needs a lot of work.  Our breakfast took over a half hour to be served only for my entire meal to be cold, yet over cooked???  Took them 5 minutes to get me a new meal and it was cooked perfectly and was very good.  Later that night we met our friends at the bar for a few drinks. Again, they took forever and were not very good for the price.

The internet was annoying. I kept getting booted out and had to log in multiple times.</Text>

We enjoyed our stay at the Napa Valley Marriott and Spa. I would certainly want to come back and stay there during my next visit to Napa. The staff was friendly and their service was superior. My personal favorite was Shedrick. As if Napa weren't enjoyable enough, it was lovely to come back to our room and the services of this hotel after a hard day of drinking wine and going to 5 star restaurants. So, when can I come back?<//text>

Normally I stay at the NVMH&S for pleasure, using built up Marriott Rewards points for a nice vacation with family. This time, I was attending a meeting, so I stayed for business. As always, the hotel lobby and grounds are beautiful. The staff was exceptional and went out of their way to make my stay great. Of special note was that my company sent me a 30 page document that required 9 hard copies to be distributed at the meeting. I asked the front desk where there was a FedEx Office location nearby to print them since the hotel does not have a business office. The front desk clerk offered to print all 9 copies for me, double sided and collated, for no cost. That saved me time and money! Excellent customer service.

My only slight disappointment was that I stayed on the side of the hotel where the rooms had not been upgraded yet. The new rooms are great, as I have stayed in them before. The old rooms are very nice and very clean, but once you have stayed in the new rooms, staying in the older rooms is a let down. Hoping the hotel will complete their room upgrades soon.</Text>

Stayed one night with my wife and kids while visiting wine country. Hotel was clean and staff was pleasant. We stayed in a "concierge" level Garden view room, which included some bonuses like free coffee and snacks in the lobby and spa access (which we didn't have time to use). Price was right and I would definitely stay again in the future.< /text>

This is THE PLACE to stay while exploring the Napa & Sonoma Valleys.  Was working all week for a client in Calistoga and every night we arrived back at the hotel greeted with great wine-tastings in the lobby.  There's a modern health club/gym on the premises with the latest technology available to cater to any type of exercise regimen.  Very friendly front desk and concierge simplify and streamline all aspects of your stay..top accommodations with just a short walk to a superb shopping district with all of the top stores within every genre : )< /Review>

We enjoyed our stay in Napa - the hotel is typically high-quality as expected at Marriott. The rooms were clean and odor free, and everything was in working order. The staff were friendly and made our night carefree. The pool was fairly warm despite the almost-freezing temperatures outdoors.  The spa is 18 and over, so the kids were not able to attend.<//Review>

<Text>This is a beautiful hotel, the restaurant and pool area is great!!! The staff is very accommodating.  The concierge is very knowledgeable. She set us up on a wine tour, which took us to 4 small vineyards, with a delicious picnic lunch at one of the vineyards, we learned a lot and bought lots of wine!!!! The restaurants in downtown Napa were great!! Can't wait to go back!!!< /Text>< pics>

A surprisingly wonderful little hotel they even have a wine & garden tour. The garden is in a sectioned off area the parking lot however I guess it's been there for a very long time and they grow a few things that they use and some of the dishes in the restaurant. It was a fun experience when they offered us some wine and the opportunity to learn about the history of the hotel and the parking lot Garden. The hotel has a pool inside the courtyard. A very nice heated seating area. And some well-groomed Landscaping that includes some AstroTurf the size of large putting green. I had a good experience at this hotel.<//Text>

This hotel is a great escape from the Bay. Centrally located in Napa Valley, in addition to the on-prem dining options, several excellent restaurants are nearby. The hotel has a great fitness center after all the indulging. The rooms are nice, large, and clean, which provides the perfect accommodations for a family or romantic getaway. The hotel provides plenty of quiet spaces on property, including firepits and small gardens.</review>

The price goes with the service you receive. Worth staying. We are family of 4. Kids enjoyed the pool, the yard. We enjoyed the complimentary culinary garden tour with champaigne for adults and juice for kids, free yoga class in the morning. Internet was strong. Breakfast was good. Not so much for the dessert in the lounge but appetizer was great, Overall, we were happy we picked this hotel.<//review>

I stayed at this hotel for the second time due to convention being here.

I should have contacted Housekeeping, but truthfully, it wasn't worth it.  There has still hair on the floor of my bathroom, and a cotton ball.. eeee...

Worse was that despite a resort fee, that includes waters to your room, my room never got cleaned at all... not once, I was there for 2 nights.  So really, they should have come in once, on day 2.  NOPE NOTHING.  I had enough towels, as it was only me... but I'm pretty sure I'm paying for housekeeping to give me new towels, make my bed, waters, etc.

SO next time... I'll go next door for half the price, or drive to another hotel close by.  There are plenty to choose from.</text>

Sufficient. The word "resort" brought images of actual beach resorts to mind so I was a little disappointed when I arrived and it was basically just a hotel with a massage place in it. The location is pretty convenient to the wineries which is nice.  I'd stay again and if I had the right expectations would be perfectly satisfied with it.< /Review>

<Text>Traveled to Napa Valley for a first ever get-away with my two sisters and we were treated like royalty. Upon arrival we were offered an upgrade to a suite. When we returned from dinner the first night we found a bottle of sparkling wine in our room to celebrate our trip. The staff went above and beyond to make us all feel welcome and like family.

The room was incredibly clean, the lounge well stocked and the evening wine tastings in the lobby an added bonus.</Text><gmap_id>0x80850720b5ae9e1f:0xe90d4170a8689308<//gmap_id>< userid>

Had Christmas dinner here. First two selections were sold out. The third option they were out of the accompanying side so subbed something else. Ordered the salad and they took 45 minutes to tell me they were out of kale and had to harvest more in the garden... Service was super slow and they were not that busy. The food was good will have to try once more on a non holiday.</text>

< Review>
The first time staying at Napa Marriott and there were good points and bad ones.  Rooms 2002 and 2074 aren't next to each other.  My room was the longest walk to the lobby you could have, that's the way you treat platinum members?  The bed was the best I have ever slept in at Marriott.  The restaurant was a welcome surprise, very good!  The conceriege had great coffee, would be nice to have a meat with eggs! Also when you have wine tasting event, choose a wine from Napa, I blog wines and the two selections were terrible!!</Review>

<Date>1518134400000<//Date><Rate>None< /Rate><Review>The first time staying at Napa Marriott and there were good points and bad ones.  Rooms 2002 and 2074 aren't next to each other.  My room was the longest walk to the lobby you could have, that's the way you treat platinum members?  The bed was the best I have ever slept in at Marriott.  The restaurant was a welcome surprise, very good!  The conceriege had great coffee, would be nice to have a meat with eggs! Also when you have wine tasting event, choose a wine from Napa, I blog wines and the two selections were terrible!!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>Attended a business meeting -room was pleasant (although I was given two doubles instead of the requested king and was told they were unable to accommodate the original request). Meeting room was perfect except they asked for $600 for the use of a projector for one day and we had to request extension cords and coffee once we arrived instead of them waiting for us. The patio however is AMAZING and worth staying again for - the second day we just stayed outside all morning and it was glorious.< /Review><rating>4< /rating><Date>1499056613532< /Date>< username>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>I experienced an awesome time in Napa Valley with a group of friends while staying at the Napa Valley Marriott Hotel & Spa. We arrived exhausted and were greeted with friendly and accomodating staff. The food at the restaurant was superb! The chef maintains a garden on the premises to ensure the freshest and most flavorful dishes. The acoustic music in the lobby was first class and an enjoyable welcome every evening, along with wine tasting from local wineries. The housekeeping services were wonderful and everything was very clean. The conceirge service was knowledgable, friendly and accomodating, even before our arrival. The Spa services and staff were incredible!! The staff was very helpful, friendly and accomodating to orchestrate a group of 7 ladies with spa services all simultaniously. The Spa Technicians are experienced and do a first class job...very relaxing and enjoyable!! Everyone at the Napa Valley Marriott Hotel & Spa did an awesome job covering every detail for an enjoyable stay and all the services were outstanding!! I look forward to returning again soon!</Text><Rate>None</Rate><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_name>

The rooms are modern and the bathrooms are updated, staff is very nice and attentive, the overall feel of the hotel is relaxing and inviting. Free hotel parking was an added perk I love. The property is located in between downtown and local wineries, it's perfect if you're making multiple plans for the weekend and don't want to be stuck in a specific area.</Text>

The renovated hotel was a welcome surprise -- we especially enjoyed the patio room with porch and Pergola. The hotel location is convenient for trips to Yountville by car/bus or bike on the Vine Trail  and walking distance to Whole Foods, Peet's and Trader Joe's.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This property is stellar in all respects.  

The F&B from banquets to the restaurant/lounge was fabulous.

Service by the staff is impeccable.

The rooms are well appointed, inviting and warm.

You cannot go wrong with this hotel whether for business or pleasure.<//Text>

Very nice newly remodeled rooms with Internet TV's. I was able to watch YouTube directly on the TV. Location is right off the highway and convenient. The concierge lounge has great breakfast, appetizers, and dessert!  Oh, and free wine tastings nightly. Staff are attentive and courteous. I would have stayed here many times before and would happily stay again in the future.</review>

The location is good on the way to Napa chateaus. It is very quick and easy to check in and check out. The room is clean and bed is very comfortbale. There are enough parking space in front of hotel. The staff was very nice to lead us to the room when we were looking for it at first night. I have a good rest at there.< /review>

<Review>Very nice hotel in the heart of wine country. Hotel is updated and the lobby is chic and inviting. Rooms are on the smaller side and there is no outdoor Jacuzzi, there is one in the spa. Overall I would recommend this hotel due to location and it's proximity to all the wineries.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>The hotel has a good location. The staff are friendly and fulfill the Marriott expectation. Our room was on the concierge level, which we only paid $10 extra, but was a bit small. This did give us access to the concierge lounge for breakfast, afternoon snacks with wine, and evening dessert. There was also a free wine tasting in the lobby each evening. The room was clean and hotel was easy to navigate. We would stay here again.< /text><userid>None</userid><Time>1405555200000</Time></record>

Loved that the hotel offered a free shuttle that departed every 30 min after 6pm.  1st night we had our free wine in the lobby while we waited for the shuttle.  The concierge helped us make dinner reservations and even gave us a free appetizer!  After our night out we called the driver and he picked us up around midnight.  The concierge the 2nd night wasnt very helpful.  Perhaps that was because the 1st one set the bar pretty high.  I would def stay here again.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<user_id>None</user_id><Review>Overall a great hotel, but 2 areas to be wary of

1. It's used for a lot of training/conferences which means it is bury and the bar area particularly can get busy.
2. The room for us was not quiet, we were on the ground floor overlooking a car park, and very close to an external entry/exit. The walls are very thin, and the door to the room lets in a LOT of noise. Therefore choose the room carefully.

if you can get a good room location, then you will have a great stay.

The staff are amazing, very helpful and friendly and will do anything for you. Food in the restaurant is excellent</Review><Rating>None</Rating>< Time>

Went to spend weekend with my son in lieu of spring break. Staff was incredibly friendly, location to die for. We enjoyed biking through the valley and having lunch along the way. Check-in/ check-out was a breeze. Lot's of help with fun things to do. Staff anticipated our needs and was extremely friendly. Would stay again without hesitation.< /text>

Great location and easy access to ***y great wineries and restaurants. We enjoyed an assortment of appetizers on the patio near the fire pit. As a rewards member with gold status, I'm familiar with the Marriotts and I usually get exceptional service. Last trip we stayed in Yountville which was more convenient to the wineries.<//Text>

Nice rooms and great location! The customer service was the only issue with this hotel. At check in I was asked for my ID, never had to do this before and none of the other guests checking in were asked for their ID's. Also, the other guests were provided a run down of all the amenities including spa services, breakfast location and hours etc. not sure why I was treated differently but it definitely affected my experience.</Review>

<text>I am Platinum for my lifetime with Marriott and it is irrelevant at this place. The Napa Marriott serves as a cheap crash pad in Napa. At best. What a joke. The staff is oblivious to differentiated service levels. No clue. I went through the ridiculous trouble to accept an upgrade to a suite on the second night of my stay. “Just pack your things, m’am, and we’ll move them to your new room.” Not!!   — after a 25 min wait at the front desk, watching the staff try to find their way out of a paper bag, we were taken to our “suite.”  I mean, please. Not worth the wait. Only stay here if you have Marriott points to burn.  Bottom of the barrel, even in a suite.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80850720b5ae9e1f:0xe90d4170a8689308</Gmap_id><UserId.>107206391931262118334</UserId.>< time>

<text>I absolutely love this place, it is beautiful and very fashion forward. However, I honestly wish someone would have told us the Raiders were staying at the hotel that weekend too. Raider nation filled the lobby, restaurant, and pool area. It was honestly ridiculous and overly crowed. The front desk was amazing, sweet, helpful, and knowledgeable. The waiters in the pool area, oh wait there were none. They came and went! We were in the pool area (which is a beautiful area) for over 5 hours and they came out maybe two times and the pool was packed. Everyone in the pool area had to get out the water and go inside to get themselves a drink. Finally, I called front desk and told them, they said they will have someone out there right now. Well right now turned into 30 mins. The waiters here make this business ratings come down. I understand it was busy with Raider nation consuming the entire building, however, they should not forget about the pool area.< /text><gmap_id>0x80850720b5ae9e1f:0xe90d4170a8689308< /gmap_id>< userid>

While I did not get the room I requested overlooking the pool, they did give me a slightly smoke smelling room overlooking the parking lot.  The Spa was outstanding as well!  Deep tissue massage that only took 2 days to book at the time I wanted.  I recommend you complain but it would not get you anywhere and you would still be happy.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

This Marriott charges a hefty premium for its location, which provides quick and easy access to various Napa wineries. However, the facilities aren't up to the prices. Room are small and have numerous problems (no real door on the bathroom, instead a sliding cover from the closet moves over?) On site food is so so. Parking is shared and inadequate for hotel guests. Central patio with open fireplace is nice on a foggy morning (photo)< /review>

Spent 5 nights on June 2015 family trip. The location is excellent, the staff is very friendly, but the rooms need to be renovated. Showers are quite outdated.  I was expecting something much better from Marriott. If the rooms would be nicely renovated I would rate it 5 stars.<//Text>

<review>I really enjoyed this Hotel and the use of the Spa. The Spa Plus the room provide a very peaceful visit to NAPA.
Its located in a perfect area near the main highway where everything is 10m away.
Finally the TV has netflix and youtube that connect to your accounts.
Really great place.< /review></record>

<Rate>None< /Rate><Review>Marriott Napa Valley did not live up to Marriott standard. Front Desk staff too rushed to check-in us in properly; gave 1 of 2 rooms when we booked for 2 rooms. Key cards were not keyed properly requiring us to return a dozen times to have it re-keyed. During all the trip back & forth (for reals - a least a dozen times, the Front Desk did not even acknowledged the inconveniences they posed upon us. Bathroom faucet literally fell off the wall (it wasn't even caulked - just fitted into pipe). Bed box spring was broken, so bed would crack whenever you sit on the bed, don't even get us starting on sleeping. The rollaway bed requested for child was a joke, the mattress was torn and worn down to point where you can feel the springs by running your hands over it. Refrigerator did not work, it was warm. And the clincher, we had garden/pool side view ground level with patio door to garden. Maintenance comes at 7am with lawn blower to wake you up.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

While the location for the Napa Valley Marriott Hotel & Spa was ideal, my stay there left me underwhelmed and disappointed. My room was far from being clean and when I addressed the issue, the front desk staff seemed annoyed with me. After a long day of travel, my friend and I did not want to switch rooms to another floor so we asked to have our breakfast comped instead. I was on hold with them on and off for over 10 minutes while they tried to handle my request, definitely not the level of service I have come to expect at a Marriott. I was so annoyed at that point that I took pictures of how dirty the room was to send to my mom who also prefers to stay at Marriotts. Luckily our bedding and the towels appeared clean. The only positives to our stay there were that the concierge was knowledgeable about which vineyards we might like, the grounds were pretty, and the food in the restaurant was good.< /Review>

Very nice and pleasant hotel. The rooms seem newly furnished and remodeled. When walking in you don't smell that musty old hotel smell instead you smell new rugs, paint and everything you hope to smell when walking into your hotel room. The site says no complementary breakfast but we found that the room behind the bar area serves free breakfast in the morning. They have a 24 hour gym that's well equipped for a travelers fitness needs and a beautiful pool with fire pit seating nearby. The front desk people are so nice and helpful as well. We definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Napa. It's 20 minutes from so good winery's up north.<//review>

<review>Update - marriott management is ignoring the theft problem when something is taken from your room without consent its theft. The outdoor area and pool are perfect for relaxing on a summer day. Love the proximity to the wineries. It's a shame the housekeeping staff decided to take our personal wine glasses that were made special for an event.  They were heavily branded and could not have been mistaken in anyway...Marriott did not compensate us at all for the loss. Real lackluster effort.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1535413014148, 'text': 'Cam, thank you for your feedback and making us aware of your glasses.

The staff was all very friendly and helpful. Hotel was very clean. The location near downtown Napa is very convenient if that is where you want to be. The price comes out to be very reasonable when you split it up. I recommend for anyone coming to napa to stay here.</Review>

This resort speaks wine country from the minute you walk up to the lobby while being greeted by grape vines. From the comfortable rooms to the complimentary wine tasting to the complimentary bicycles, this resort and spa has it all. It is not a large property which adds to the conveniences throughout. The bicycle ride through the wine county was a added surprise. We will definitely be back.<//Review>

<Review>The location of the hotel is very central to all wineries and other attractions in Napa.  The food was excellent and the chefs homemade salads dressings are superb.  The staff is the star at this hotel. You will feel pampered by each and every one.

The lobby, bar, restaurant and outdoor area are beautiful.  They have a wine tasting at the hotel every evening.</Review><username>HappyVisitor</username>< Pics>

< review>
The property itself was great, the rooms were comfortable and spacious, and the location was also fantastic. Where there is room for improvement is the SERVICE. Considering it was a holiday weekend, the staff seemed VERY unprepared and understaffed.

Example 1 - the hair dryer in the room was broken and I called for a replacement. I had to make 3 calls and waited a total of 45 minutes before a new dryer was finally brought up.

Example 2 - there were very limited lounge chairs in the pool area, both days we went we ended up sitting on the ground near the pool and just waiting for someone to leave, and when that happened, it was like a competition with other guests to get to the chair first.

Example 3 - towels. Completely out of towels (both days at the pool) and we had to wait over an hour for towels to be restocked.

Example 4 - Breakfast. We sat outside for nearly 25 minutes and asked multiple times for someone to come take our order. Or even bring menus and place settings. It seemed like there was ONE person managing all the tables outside and in the pool area, which is obsurd!!

Again considering it was a holiday weekend and the property was almost fully booked, you would think you would have ample staff and coverage to provide quality service for the extremely costly price we paid.<//review>

entire hotel was a giant construction site. I was not told of this in advance.
I redeemed 120,000 points for this stay... countless nights in Marriott hotels away from my children.

As a show of their appreciation, Marriott thought it was necessary to have a gentleman use a jackhammer literally 12 inches from my room's window at 8am. The view from my room wasn't a lovely pool or landscaped patio , but rather excavated earth, exposed cinderblocks, pipes, backhoes, dozens of men in hard hats, and red and yellow caution tape.

It was the most absurd hotel experience of my life. I am furious and embarrassed to have brought my wife there.

If by the end of the day the 120,000 points that I redeemed are not credited back to my account I will consider it a major insult.</review>

The Napa Marriott is ideally located, central to good wineries and excellent restaurants. The staff is very professional and outgoing to accommodate their customers. The staff always exceeds our expectations and our first class. This was our 2nd time staying in the last couple of years even though we live in the bay area. We'll definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and book future stays in Napa with them.</review>

Jessica at concierge is awesome! Staff do their best. Marriott value missing slightly, but a good nights sleep was still had.< /review>

<rating>None</rating><Review>This resort just finished a large renovation and the public areas and rooms are very nicely updated.  The pool area is new; I think they missed the mark when they did not put in a hot tub though.  If I'm at a resort, I look forward to an evening soak.

The staff was outstanding and extremely helpful.  The location was great for traveling around wine country.  

The only issue we had, and it was so bad that we will not be going back, was the quality of the AC units in the rooms.  They are old units and one of the loudest ones that I have ever experienced.  Even though the bed was very comfortable, my sleep was so broken up by the noise coming in and out.  I wish they would have used some of the reno money on updating these units.<//Review>< pictures>

<Date>1483576412759</Date><rating>1< /rating><Text>I would give zero stars if possible. We are looking to have a small family event at the location and made initial contact in November through the hotel's website. Received a response saying that someone would contact us within the week. No response, no contact.

Called in last month and talked to someone who said that they did see the email, but blamed the "internet" for the non response. Said that he would get someone to contact us within the next few days.  No response, no contact.

Called in again today, got forwarded to a person who might be able to help us...but no. We were told that a big conference is in town and has booked the facilities for our chosen weekend.  So, either the "big conference" was just booked, (very doubtful), or they just don't care about a small group gathering. Either way, the incompetence shown by the Banquet and meeting people was just inexcusable.

Here's an idea...answer your emails and phone calls in a timely fashion and let the "little people" know that your facility is booked.  This would have allowed us to move on to the next facility and not lost two months of planning time.  Being "very sorry" is no help.  Following through with good communication goes a long way towards good customer service.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1483657597462, 'text': 'Hi Brian,\n\nThank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

A reservation was made by one of my children as a surprise to me for Mother's Day in order to spend our day exploring the Napa Valley region of California.  We were supposed to check in our hotel and then hire a vehicle to drive us around the area.  Unfortunately, our weekend was soured by the lack of service and poor accommodations experience we had to go through at the Marriott Napa Valley.  Although a conversation took place directly with a staff member of the facility regarding the accommodations, this was not to be so.  A denial was made by a front desk trainee and a more experienced front desk persona was less than friendly or accommodating.  Not only that the restaurant's service was slow and poor.  I would never waste my time or money at this facility in the future.<//review>

The rooms are nicely appointed and comfortable. It was a fine place for a conference.
We understood that the hotel was under renovation. We did not understand why they still added a daily surcharge for "benefits" that they could not provide due to this construction, such as the whirlpools, the "free Starbucks coffee", the spa services, the swimming pool, etc.<//review>< pictures>

I've stayed here twice... The first time I had a wonderful room and enjoyed my stay and the cost (which is steep) was worth it. The second visit, the location of the room was horrible and the boatload of cash spent on the room was anything but worth it.... If they are over booked stay somewhere else. The hotel is in a convenient location, but for half the price you can stay at a springhill marriott just a few miles away, that is just as nice or nicer cause the rooms are larger than standard rooms.<//review>

The title says it all.  I have been a business and leisure traveler for 30 years and Marriott knocked this one out of the park. I highly recommend staying at the Napa Valley Marriott Hotel and Spa. Make sure you take a bike ride to Yountville and  experience the sensational restaurants and of course stop by the Chandon for a glass of champagne.</Text>

<review>Rooms and hotel were nicely updated, but a Spa without a heated outdoor pool or outdoor whirlpool, VERY disappointing. Then the staff, front desk and concierge were nice, but the concierge club team, not so much. In fact, this was the MOST DISAPPOINTING lounge I've ever stayed with Marriott. What a joke, no evening cocktails or honor bar at all, everything was out of stock. Waters, soda.... Empty. The daily snack was goldfish, REALLY, I'm spending my anniversary in a Marriott Resort and Spa, and this is the joke of access and service you give us.  Definitely WON'T recommend this hotel, just keep driving and stay up the road in the more legit resort spas.</review><resp>None<//resp>< userid>

Our recent visit to the Napa Valley Marriott was a pleasant surprise. The hotel lobby has been renovated since our last visit with a very inviting new Bar/Restaurant, a big improvement from the previous cafeteria like bar in the rear. The hotel had been closed for a week due to the recent earth quake but they were up & running on by our stay with no interruption of service.< /text>

This hotel is in a decent location, has friendly staff and has very comfortable beds, but outside those things, I wouldn't recommend this if you are used to staying in Marriott properties. The property looks more like a motel and seems to be very old. The walls are pretty thin, so that makes for a difficult nigh sleep when you can hear every door down the hall open and close. It wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't stay there again.</review>

No value, frustrating stay, embarrassing that I picked this hotel and suggested to friends and family that felt the same way with their stay. Not Marriott standards. The customer should be treated fairly and staff should at least try and make an effort to accommodate. Worst experience I have and for the money I spent I felt that it was a complete rip off.</Text>

This was my second time ever in Napa and first time staying at this hotel. I loved the location so much. It was right in the middle of everything, but still ticked away in it's own resort-style fashion. The Napa Marriott is not only a hotel, but it also has a beautiful fitness center and spa facility. The amenities are great. They have a beautiful pool with food and beverage service, an indoor and outdoor restaurant on site as well as a café and gift shop. For Elite members, they also offer a concierge lounge that offers breakfast each morning and cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, and dessert each evening, with the exception of some weekend nights. My check in and check out experience was lovely. They welcomed me, explained the amenities, told me I had been upgraded to a corner king room, and had me on my way. My room was beautiful. It was so big it had a hallway as you entered. To my pleasant surprise, I was greeted by a welcome letter with two complimentary wine tasting tickets for the lobby and candy with a bottle of wine. I was so happy! I felt very welcomed and taken care of. If ever in the area, I would definitely stay here again. Thank you NAPA Marriott!</Text>

<review>Check with your front desk with customer's requests when they check out. Go to that extra mile to make sure their stay was excellent and you'll get repeat customers. If there's a group like we had, it's important for management to understand who the appropriate parties are...especially the decision makers of the group. Good luck to you as your hotel's appearance has improved dramatically, I for one probably won't be coming back.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

My husband I spent a quick few nights in the hotel. Nice decor throughout. Complimentary outdoor parking allows you to park near your room, regardless of where you room is located. The location of the restaurant is on the way to all the wineries and very convenient to town.</text>

The event was well organized. The luncheon provided was stellar, the staff was friendly and helpful. The facilites were immaculate.

I would look to have my own event there and i would readily stay there as a quest.

They certainly do not pride themselves with customer service or follow-up.
They just want your Money! Oh let me repeat it from the Managers words-My Goal here is t make sure that the hotel stays full.
Also, no correspondence about your booking. I would never use them again.
In fact, I'm not planning to use any Marriott at all. Customer Care is the worst.<//text>

We have been staying at the Napa Valley Marriott 2 - 3 times a year for the past 10 - 12 years and have always had an excellent experience. The staff is the epitome of professionalism and have always exceeded our expectations. Can't wait till our next visit.<//review>

<Rating>None<//Rating><review>My husband and I stayed at the Napa Valley Marriott Hotel & Spa before a marathon I ran. It was a very nice, comfortable property. We ate several meals there, all of which were delicious (three room service orders, a pasta dinner and continental breakfast for runners on marathon day). All the staff people we encountered were friendly and helpful.
A minor gripe - I thought it was a bit ridiculous to have to pay for Internet considering how much we were paying for the room on the first night (before the marathon, so I'm sure there was a high demand).<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

The accommodations were very nice. All of the amenities we needed were there and the bed was very comfortable. The internet functioned well in our room. So, what went wrong? We arrived at 3:00pm and our room wasn't ready. We were told we'd have one in an hour at most. We waited in the lobby a full hour, and had to go back to the desk to finally get into a room (not the one we were supposed to have) with barely enough time to make it to the rehearsal dinner. Water leaked into our bathroom from the bathroom above, and although the problem was fixed, our bathroom floor remained covered in water later that day. Housekeeping cleaned it up well and supplied us with all new towels to replace the ones we had to use to mop up the water. Breakfast in the restaurant was served very promptly and efficiently by friendly, well-trained servers. The food was excellent and the portions were generous. The price was appropriate for an upscale hotel restaurant. We liked the flavored water in the lobby, but on the second day it ran out in the late afternoon and wasn't refilled. We didn't report that, and maybe it was refilled after we left for the evening. Overall, the hotel and grounds were lovely, but we didn't get much time to enjoy them because we were very busy the entire weekend. Without these problems I probably would give the Marriott a higher rating.</text>

We loved the Marriott Napa. (55357)(56846) The staff was wonderful, the food great and the atmosphere relaxing and very comfortable. We had 12 in our party and we all loved staying there. Would highly recommend the them to anyone.</Review>

<text>I was part of a group of three couples that stayed at this hotel from 9/22/2016-9/24/2016.  Overall, the hotel is very nice, but dated.  Our room was in the Concierge area and farthest away from the front desk.  We had absolutely no wifi service in our room the entire time which was extremely disappointing.  A call to the front desk promised that a service technician would call and the call never came.  A subsequent call to the front desk informed us that we would have to come to the lobby to connect and then the service would be fine in the room. This was not the case either.  This Marriott property was not up to the standards that I am accustomed to with the Marriott brand.  I would not stay here again on another trip to Napa.<//text>< Pictures>

They have bikes you can ride into the town area a few blocks away. Theres a wonderful air in the early morning hours that feels like a chilly ocean breeze. The hotel is shaped like a very large square with a small pool area and even smaller putting green in the center.

My stay started out poorly. We were very disappointed that our request to have connecting rooms was not honored after3 phone calls including the day before to the front desk. After expressing our disappointment, Cheri came out and did a very good job of apologizing and offering to move us to new rooms the next day so the remainder of our stay would have connecting rooms. She was genuine and did everything she could to make up for the mistake. Our stay ended up being very enjoyable. The food in the concierge lounge was better than any other hotel where I’ve stayed.< /text>

< review>
Very convenient location in Napa right off CA. For a hotel that is $300 a night this is just terrible service. The hotel is situated in Napa close to wonderful vineyards and tasting rooms as well as to a plethora of choices for fine dining. Would easily return to this property.</review>

<Review>Your staff at the front desk is great. Your ability to have a room ready for a gold elite member isn't. Asked for an early check-in of 130, got there at 240 and the room wasn't ready. The front staff called cleaning and it was still being cleaned. Checked back with them multiple times and room wasn't ready at 315 still. The staff was nice enough to let us get ready at the spa for an event we had to be at by 4. Not sure I will stay here again and really questioning my commitment to Marriott and my SPG luxury card. That isn't worth $450 a year.<//Review>< pictures>

<rate>2</rate><text>We are Marriott members and recently stayed here.  Was disappointed in our room.- low popcorn ceilings and faced parking lot. Also our air conditioner was extremely loud. Cleanliness in room was ok, but at pool and spa no one seemed to be cleaning.  Our spa massage was a 1 out of 5 and super disappointing for my husband and I.  We should of walked out of spa on seeing condition of serenity room and locker room.  I wanted so bad to have a great time.  This hotel is I where near our previous Marriott standard.<//text>< pics>

<text>Stayed for 2 nights over the weekend for Valentine's day. Place is clean but is currently under construction and renovation. When the place is finished it should look great. Rooms are comfortable to stay in but they are not large.  Nice comfortable place to stay in Napa Valley right in the middle of a lot of the places you want to go to in this area. It is also conveniently located just minutes away from shopping like Whole Foods, Target, Trader Joes, and simple places to grab a bite to eat. -2 stars for being under construction and renovation and having no pool.< /text>< user>

<text>Try as the staff might - and they are great folks - they are fighting a losing battle with an older property that doesn't justify the prices they are trying to charge, especially in the summer and fall. I have stayed here multiple times and I always wonder why I keep coming back to here - and the answer is that it's the only decent Marriott property in the valley. The rooms are average, internet is AWFUL, the pool and jacuzzi are older and undersized for the population staying at the hotel. A bright spot of this property, other than its people, is the Concierge Lounge. I wish them luck in recovering from the recent earthquake as well, but I wish Marriott would start fresh with a new property in the area.<//text>< user>

Easy to find and park, while the exterior isn't much to look at, you'll rest comfortably in the room,  tastefully redone. Those with lounge access can sit inside or outside but there is no view, but good options for food and concierge help - once you figure out where it is. Wished the concierge lounge would add fans or something to move the air on a hot day.

Pool opened while there and is nice, umbrella stands are super heavy and awkward to move. 

Fitness room fills up quickly given its size. 

It's just a few miles from st Napa - so grab a bus or bike, your car or a tour.<//review>

Upon are arrival we were greeted with a glass of sparkling wine before we checked-in. The front desk associate was very friendly and informative. We enjoyed hanging out on the property the night we checked-in and took a dip in the jacuzzi and later sat out on the patio by the fire pits. I would stay at the property again.<//review>

I had a good overall experience at this hotel. It is conveniently located and has friendly staff. I thought that the concierge lounge could have stayed open longer, as I was disappointed to find it empty with no offerings out at 10 am. 

Other than that, I thought that parking was a little tight, but I had a very pleasant stay.<//Text>

<text>A great choice compared to the other high end resorts.  Hilton is right beside this place if you find it your choice.

The pool is new but it was cold in March.  The resort fee is worth it I think.

Nice staff and extras.  Music downstairs and free drinks at night.

<review>The location of the hotel is great.  There is a Starbucks one block away, and Whole Foods and Target are across the street.  Each evening we headed over to the Whole Foods to get cheese and fresh bread to go w/our wine.  Location of hotel was also close to several wineries and restaurants.  The hotel offers free HH/Wine tasting each evening.  We did this one night and it was ok.  We also took advantage of the fitness center each morning, but found you need to get there at 8:00AM or before to have your choice of machine.</review><Resp>None</Resp><username>Travelocity reviewer</username><rate>None</rate>< pictures>

Nice hotel and they've done a good job in keeping it fresh. What is outstanding is the service provided by a very competent staff. We grabbed a bite to eat at the restaurant inside the hotel which was pretty tasty, and then we went to inquire about wine tastings.<//Review>

The Marriott Hotel and Spa in Napa is THE PLACE to stay for Bottlerock.  The newly renovated rooms are super comfy and offer a great place to relax after a full day of Bottlerocking!  And the SPA is a great place to rejuvenate before heading back to see your favorite act!<//text>

<Review>This hotel is in a good location not too far from Yountville. We loved that it was right off a bike trail where you can ride into downtown Yountville directly. Staff was so nice and helpful as well. Would highly recommend this hotel as the price was also much cheaper than some of the other big chains.</Review>< user_name>

I am a Marriott rewards member. I used points to stay at this location. It was a perfect place to venture out into the wine country for the day, which we did. Clean property. Friendly staff, allowed early check in and upgraded us to a room facing the pool (most others face a busy highway). I probably wouldn't consider this a "luxury spa", but I knew this going in as I read many Trip Advisor reviews. Nonetheless, it is a nice, clean property with accommodating staff. We did not eat here, or use the bar or Spa services so I can't comment on those topics. Enjoy Napa! It's beautiful!< /text>

This hotel had a few rough edges, but was clean and well laid out. The location does not make it worth the premium they get for this hotel's room rate. If you have money to spare I could see it being nice for a romantic weekend. Loved the area, but I'll stay elsewhere next time.< /Review>

After a busy day visiting the Napa area wineries, stores and restaurants, my husband and I sat outside in the courtyard with a glass of wine watching a fire in the fire pit. It was perfect temperature( around 60 degrees). The moon was out and almost full. There was a slight breeze every once in a while which was perfect!<//text>

The staff, from reservationist, check-in, waiters to concierge service was exceptional. Our celebration anniversary was made even better with the professional staff at the Napa Valley Marriott Hotel & Spa. They truly made us feel special with the excellent service extended during our stay.< /text>

< Review>
if you are looking for a Napa Valley Wine Country Experience, this may not be the place for you.  If you are looking more for  just a clean, nice place to stay at, and the location is not of the most importance, then it definitely gets the job done.  Facility is very clean, staff is very helpful, food is great, courtyard is lovely.</Review>

This hotel and the rooms look nice but the rooms are noisy and are small. Even some outlets in our room did not work. I would give this hotel 2 stars as a hotel but the spa here is nice and the people were very nice so it gets 3 stars.</review>

My wife and I wanted to find a quick get away not too far from where we live . . . and come across this Hotel in Napa, California. The price is very reasonable, and upon check-in, you receive a bottle of wine as a welcome gift.Helpful front desk staff help us to find a room close to the Spa facility, and give us a free upgrade. Great PR, will return for our next Napa visit.</Review>

The staff were pleasant and helpful but parts of the property were lacking.  I took several pictures of the sliding door to balcony, the filthy vents in the room and bathroom, the badly repaired tile in the shower, etc.  The bed also did not seem as good as other Marriott properties (Ritz Carlton & Marriott) we have stayed at in Guangzhou/Shanghai, China, Hawaii, St. Thomas and dozens of other Marriott properties around the US.  I never do surveys or reviews but this property was worth the time as it needs some tender loving care in areas.  Water pressure adjusted drastically down to a trickle at times while taking showers and engineering "SUPPOSEDLY FIXED" it.  We kept having the issue off and on and just gave up asking after two times.  They also cleaned the room late (after 4) the first two days.  We had to call and ask what was going on.  They did remedy it and give us some points for the delay, but I would rather not have to deal with it.</review>

Expensive, but great staff. Upgrade to Concierge service. Room was fine, but not really exceptional. Go for the service. We have stayed twice for a week, so we really like the place.

Oh, don't forget to go for a hot air balloon ride while you are there.< /review>

Other than our initial problem we had during check-in, where you allowed members of our party to check in with the wrong reservation numbers we had a nice time and the service was good.  Your rooms could use more light in them though, very dark.</review>

<Review>Check in was a nightmare, gave us a room that was already occupied. Almost made us stay in it because "it looked clean enough". 0 out of 4 keys would not work all 3 days we were staying. Had to get a new set of keys each night. Information given at check in of "free" services (breakfast, glasses of wine) not detailed at check in and ended up not being true or free. Would not recommend!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Lovely place to stay. You could not fit all the amenities into one nights stay. My favorites were the garden and the lounge outside. Complimentary shuttle services came in handy as well for a nearby venture.</review>

<Text>The Marriott is convenient to almost everything in Napa. It is easy to access to the property. It does seem to draw quite a consistent crowd and on occasion the parking which is quite large can be a challenge. But would stay there again without hesitation.<//Text><user>None</user>< Rating>

<text>This hotel is very overrated as a Category 8 hotel in the Marriott system.  It is a very ordinary Marriott and you wouldn't know if it was in Wichita, Milwaukee, or Napa if it weren't for the address.  

I cannot believe the price of rooms - cash price or Rewards points.  Marriott needs to either improve the condition of this hotel, or adjust the pricing.

I would never stay there again!!  

Please keep in mind that I am a loyal Marriott customer with over $1M points and I own 6 Marriott Vacation Club properties besides Marriott Destination points.  Please take my comments to be constructive criticism as this hotel will not effect my decision to book future Marriott properties.</text>< Pictures>

Situated in Napa Valley, this Marriott property has many perks. Beautiful location /excellent staff/ great spa. As far as price to comfort ratio, it's a swing and a miss. The bed was wildly uncomfortable in my room and to be honest with you I used Marriott rewards points for the room, and it felt like a waste. I feel like if you're a middle class person going to the area, you could probably find places that were a lot cheaper and your comfort would match the amount that you paid. In this case I don't feel like that's the case and I'm not likely to return to this Marriott property. .< /Text>

<Review>I feel in the service this hotel is similar to most in the Marriott family but there is a much higher expectation for the area that was not met. The little things made all the difference,ie lack in the offerings with food, lack of restroom facilities at the pool, parking lot views, lack of over all energy at the facility etc. I was not WOWed and felt the is a basic quality to the service.</Review>< pics>

<response>None< /response><rate>None</rate><Text>We were in town for Memorial Day/Bottle Rock weekend. Hotel was busier than normal but we expected that.  They were just completing their recent renovation/enhancement.  The look and aesthetic is nice but the details are lacking.  Bed was very hard and uncomfortable. I was convinced the spa chose this to encourage more business maybe?  

Rooms are noisy. Large gap under door let's in all outside hallway noise and when you have the pleasure of getting the room across from the ice machine by the elevator near the exit door overlooking the parking lot that means a lot of noise and foot traffic.  (I suppose someone has to get that room so why not an Elite member right?).  Share with door between rooms has a similar issue so you get to hear all their activity as well (shower, hairdryer, late night fun, etc).  Between that and the bed it is difficult to get a decent nights rest.  

Parking was difficult with the increased weekend traffic and parking lot still being taken up by renovation related trailers, equipment, etc it was less than ideal.  It is a stretch to have the Marriott flag on this property.  Was looking forward to a great stay in a newly renovated property. Unfortunately we got a mediocre stay in a renovation that did not cover all the bases.  Would not recommend at the the Napa prices they charge. Feels more like an Airport hotel than a luxury Napa Spa Resort.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

This hotel is out dated and the rooms are small. Being Titanium level, got me nothing so don't expect an upgrade. The hotel is about a 5 - 10 min Uber to downtown.<//review>

<Review>I was disappointed to learn of the mandatory 20$ daily "resort fee" that was charged.  The woman at the front desk explained that it was disclosed upon purchasing the room; however I have yet to find that explanation in my reservation.

The fee included classes that I was not interested in, and daily water replenishment that never happened.  This is the main reason I would not recommend this hotel to friends or business associates: the hidden daily fees that were not disclosed upon reservation, nor pertinent to my stay.< /Review>< Name>

Very disappointed! The hotel is under construction and is in complete dismay. The pool isn't openned and there's little to no parking. There are men working on the roof and all over the hotel. Very loud and not relaxing. I woukdnt recommend staying here. They overbooked our party and had to move us to a different hotel.</Text>

Our stay at the Napa Valley Hotel and Spa was very pleasurable. The hotel and grounds are in top notch shape, and is well situated in an area for sightseeing or just a night out in a beautiful town. I look forward to future stays.</Text>

<text>This Marriott is average in all decor aspects roomwise.

Just came for drinks. The bar is generally quiet and comfortable. Drinks are too expensive though, just a bit higher than is the norm in Napa. If I'm reviewing the spa alone I give it 5 stars.<//Text>

This Marriott at one time was nice, but it is showing it's age in design and a room quality. Furniture was dated. TV not working and was fixed, but room was not ready for guests. The bed was great and redeeming factor of this hotel..</review>

<rating>None< /rating><Text>Overall the attention to detail from service to functionality is sorely lacking. The Restaurant/Bar is poorly managed, if at all.
The front desk (at critical times at check-in) seems overwhelmed and insecure. The "computer station" for guest use is not user friendly and is not printer accessible. The Concierge Desk seemed to be staffed that was a combination of unorganized/overwhelmed and lacked appropriate and professional work space. The Bell Staff was courteous and cordial.
The guest hallways were littered with room service items and even a stained twin mattress leaning on the wall at check-on Friday through the better part of Saturday into Sunday morning. As a Silver Elite Member, I have never been so disappointed as I was with this particular stay, as I have stayed in this hotel at least once every 18 months for the last 20 years.< /Text>< pictures>

As previously stated, the property was very nice and staff very friendly.  My room, however, had a mildewy smell.  I did alert the staff, who was receptive but the oder was not resolved during my stay.</Review>

It's nice as per usual with Marriott's but the elevator makes grinds, clicks, and jerks suddenly. Be nice if they spent the money they make on a new elevator that didn't scare guests.< /Review>

Nice location, decent size rooms with extremely comfy beds. Fast wifi, good showers, concierge breakfast leaves something to be desired and super crowded but to be expected during busy season.<//text>

2. The outdoor spa was occupied with parents with small children for hours on Friday evening. Very disappointing. We never got to use it.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Had Christmas dinner at the VINeleven. The staff were extremely friendly and the food was excellent. We ordered the Thai curry mussels and spiced chicken lettuce cups - great flavors, highly recommended. This place is also kid-friendly, they provided our kids crayons and drawing paper.< /review>< date>

The employees were nice enough, but their service was slow and by the time the food came out IT WAS COLD. We two were the only customers in the restaurant at the time...

From check in to check out you are well looked after. The public areas of this hotel are nice and welcoming, many areas to sit outside with heaters for cooler temps. The pool is kept warm.<//text>

I truly enjoy staying at this resort. The amenities, pool, concierge lounge and staffing are exceptional. My only negative comments would be the drink prices are ridiculously high, but I guess that’s Napa for year. I travel for work and stay her whenever I can get the rate that fits my budget.< /Text>

I would like to express that the hotel staff, exemplified customer services to new levels.   They where caring, helpful, and devoted, something which has been lost in the hospitality industry. Lately, hospitality is more you get what you pay for, but not at the Napa Valley Marriott Hotel.< /text>

< Review>
Great place to stay in Napa. Has amble lot of parking, rooms are really well kept and new. Has a good bar -- and a decent size conference room for team offsites.

Located only 3 mi away from Napa downtown makes it an ideal place for a short weekend stay. Has a nice outdoor sitting area by the pool, serves starbucks coffee on demand.

Housekeeping services could be slow, especially if a large group is staying on the days you visit. But overall a good experience for the price they charge. I would encourage you to look for rooms on second and third levels vs the first level -- especially if you like your privacy. The gym is good, but the pool is strictly okay.</Review>

The hotel was ok.  I noticed that most hotels in Napa Valley are old.  Perhaps they need to build new hotels.  The price they charge is as high as the tastings at the wineries in Napa Valley.  Way too High!</Review>

Generally the hotel is good. The parking I didn't care for, it's maybe because we always arrived late in the evening that the parking had always been hard to find. I don't know what the turn around for housekeeping but our room wasn't done and it was already pass noon. Don't know how the rest of the grounds look like as we didn't have any time to look around< /Text>

You really owe it to yourself to check out the Napa Valley Marriott Hotel & Spa. Their outside lounge area provides all the ambience and comfort with couches and fire pits. The food is divine and the service superb.< /review>

<Text>This hotel is overpriced.  The rooms are small and bathrooms are nothing special, especially for a "spa."  The only positive it has going for its location.  I would not stay here in the future.< /Text>< gmap_id>

The Napa Valley Marriott is the go-to place to stay for the Marathon. I feel like they roll out the red carpet for the runners during this weekend - hospitality, ease of check-in/out, and the courtesy late check out made for a wonderful stay. I'm checking in every year indefinitely!</Text>

The two story building and long corridors reminds you of the classic style hotels, probably to keep in line with local residential plans.

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Vacation from Hell!! Take this as a warning.. DO NOT STAY HERE...How can a place so awful be a part of such a beautiful town like Napa? We booked a Garden view room & called to confirm they can accommodate 2 Double beds. Upon arrival, there was no Garden view or Double bed availible- So we went  with it.. They promised to bring a roll away.. As soon as we walked into the room it smelled like dirty mop water.. & there were tiny drain flies flying  everywhere.. We called down to the desk & they said they would send someone to spray. We left for dinner upon returning at 11:30 there was no roll away & no one sprayed.. We were on NY time, so we were exhausted & wanted to call it a night.. one of us jumped in the shower & we quickly noticed water pouring from under the bathroom door- , the toilet was EXPLOADING- there was a water main break there was 3 inches of sewage water pouring into the room, Saturating my $500 luggage & even crossing over to the connection room . We again called the front desk who came down & was just as shocked as we were to see the water everywhere.. Mind you this was close to 1am in the morning- They were completely sold out so getting another room was not an option.. The front end manager promised she would cover the total of our nights stay & try to negotioate the price down at another area hotel.. Well, Guess what?! She sent us off in a taxi & has completly avoided our calls since them.. They did not cover our room fee, did not help us get a new place to stay for the remainder of our trip & on top of it kept the $1000 hold charge  on my card. I have never seen such unprofessionalism in a hotel in my life- We called the property back at least 10 times & the general Manager avoided our calls every time- A Multi-billion dollar corporation such as Marriott should be ashamed in how they displaced us & are not blatantly ignoring this issue- We even called the office of Mr. Marriott himself Who ensured us the property would be calling us back. & Still nothing... A company such a Marriott should be over compensating when an issue as such occurs instead they are adding "insult to injury" by their blatant disrespect for the situation. AVOID THIS PROPERTY AT ALL COST- Trust me, you will thank me for it.. We planned this trip for over a year & it was a vacation from HELL!  Marriott; you should be ashamed.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>As I mentioned before the TV Satellite issue has happened to me so many times I have given up reporting it to anyone at the hotel. Most of the time there is nothing they can do to resolve the issue, they just say sorry but we are having a temporary problem with the reception. what is strange in this case, it was a clear day outside, no rain. As for the Air Conditioning it's a bother to have to call at midnight, knowing what else would you be prepared to do?, Would you move a guest to a new room, try to fix it at that late hour of the night? My thought it that something as simple as Air Conditioning needs to work? Are you inspecting the rooms before the guest show up? Do you have a regular maintenance program to avoid these issues?</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Went for the Napa Valley Marathon. All of the discount rooms sold out. Best price we could get was $422 for one nitght (this was the final bill). Check in was 4 and check out was 11. Although I knew the price going into it, I would say that the service and the room did not justify the cost. Felt like I got screwed over while hundreds of other marathoners likely paid half the cost that I did. People at the front were not helpful in trying to provide a further discount. I wont pay that much to stay here again.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>When I reserved the room, I was put in a room that has a structure that blocked the view from the window. When I spoke to the first front desk person, this front desk staff member was rude and did not take the time to understand my situation or offered an alternate solution. But the second front desk person was nice, customer oriented and completely corrected the problem in a satisfying manner.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>Was a bit hesitant with all the negative reviews but glad I took a chance. Overall the hotel was clean and staff was friendly. During our time here there was also a convention going on so there was quite a bit of traffic and congestion.

The check in process was a bit painful as they had a live band playing about 30 feet away. Once pass the check in process, we had a bit of trouble finding a space as the parking lot was filled. Overall the room was clean and didn't notice anything dirty. The refrigerator (even though it's behind a door) was grumbling the whole time and the we had one missing glass. A quick call to the front desk and housekeeping brought another one up to us. One suggestion I would make is don't be cheap on the Kleenex. If it looks like it's almost going to run out, save yourself the hassle and just put another box there as that's what happened; we had to call and ask for another box but staff was friendly and quick to bring another one up.

Room service here was very good. The person who brought up the food was friendly. I asked about the spa next door and he admittedly said he didn't know but will find out. Sure enough he did and came back to our room with the information. The room service breakfast (as expected) is on the pricier side but the food is quite good.

For their so called "Resort fee" you do get quite a few benefits for the $20 you pay. You can go downstairs and get 2 free cups of coffee in the morning (this is in addition to what they have in the room), yoga class, fitness center access, and early morning (8:30 to noon) to the spa and sauna. The spa and sauna is next door and it's a must try. Clothing is optional. You can also use their bicycles (there may be a charge but it's nominal).<//Text>< pics>

My sisters and I spent a few days at the Napa Valley Marriott, we had joining rooms and a single and we were treated very well and had a very good stay. I would recommend this hotel in the future.<//review>

The room and bed were as expected for a Marriott.  I slept very well, had plenty of space, enjoyed the casual friendly atmosphere, but wish the food service at the bar and restaurant was faster and had better selections of food at better prices.</review>

Four day stay during the remodeling at this hotel. Either should've closed the hotel during the remodel or dropped the price accordingly as much of the resort was mud. Staff overwhelmed by the process. Very noisy air systems in what seemed like nice rooms.</Text>

The heater-fan in the room was so loud that I couldn't get a sleep. When I turned off the heater, the room got cold quickly. My bill was over-charged for "destination" fee. I would not go back to this place ever.< /review>

<Review>Highly disappointed to say the least. Out for a business trip so we took a couple of extra days before hand to relax. So much for that!!! Our "upgraded" garden side room had the pool under construction and patio full of plants. The tub wouldn't hold water and there was a 3/4 empty bottle of wine left in the fridge. Went down and girl was accomadating to switch rooms for us which just led into another very unpleasant experience. Needless to say not a relaxing vacation so far!!! Thanks Marriott!!!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>The hotel is more for retired people. the building is pretty dull looking, outside and inside. Horrible experience in the steam room. Discolored our bathing suites and they didn't do anything about it. Requested for more towels and body wash but never received it. For the rate we paid, not worth it at all.< /Review><name>MarriottNapa</name>< pics>

<Name>J Abelar</Name><Date>1487781589701< /Date><Rate>3</Rate><text>The hotel has a bit of a split personality due to the fact that they seem to have rennovated all the common areas so that the lobby, lounge, spa, patio and conference rooms are quite nice; however, the guest rooms and hallways have seen much better days -- they smell musty, have problems with the temperature control, and the rooms have several annoyances. For example, the bathroom door was one that slides but didn't seem to have any way to lock it. Worse, you could greatly hurt your finger (break it, which I almost did) because the sliding door was pretty heavy and is shared with the closet (if bathroom is shut then closet is open and vice versa) so if someone exits the bathroom in a hurry while someone else is rummaging in the closet the latter is going to get hurt. The desk chair did not roll so had to scoot it. Just a number of things like that. Overall I wouldn't specifically seek to stay there again. If they renovate the guest rooms then it could be quite a nice place to stay.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80850720b5ae9e1f:0xe90d4170a8689308< /Gmap_id></record>

Location is right off of the freeway in Napa, so the access is convenient.  It is not as huge as it seems, since there are conference rooms and the spa.  The pool is nice and open all the time, and their outdoor patio area is incredible.

Staff wasn't nearly as great.  We booked using priceline and ended up with 2 double beds.  The staff worked hard to convince us that we actually had 2 queens, not doubles.  It was a busy weekend and they were booked solid, but it shows that priceline purchases aren't as prioritized as high as if you book elsewhere.< /Review>

<Review>Place is dirty.  Hostess didn't allow us to check-in until after 4pm.  Another person who came in after us complained about it and got a room before us.  We didn't feel like complaining because we are on a weekend getaway.  I won't come back.< /Review>< pics>

Rarely do I write a negative review however, our experience at this particular Marriott was by far the most poorly managed Marriott I have ever stayed in.

1)  Concierge: Friday, 9/20/13 - Guests directed to see a concierge, yet no concierge available (4pm in the afternoon) after 25 minutes waiting & a long line of guests waiting, we went to the front desk & they finally sent someone over.

2) Housekeeping:  Friday, 9/20/13 - A guest of the hotel spilled red wine in the middle of the side entrance door where we entered the hotel.  24 hours later the red wine was still there, nobody had cleaned it up.

3) Housekeeping: Saturday, 9/21/13 -  Departed our room early in the morning, came back at 3pm to get ready for a dinner event and the room still hadn't been cleaned.

4)  Housekeeping / Front Desk:  Sunday 9/22/13 - at 6:55AM Housekeeping comes into our room...yes, folks, 6:55AM !!   We called front desk to ask why the intrusion and they responded that someone on staff had errored in checking us out of the room.  So much for early morning romance.

Don't waste paying top dollar Money/Points staying here....was not at all reflective of the Marriott brand I've been accustomed too.< /Text>

The staff was wonderful, friendly and very helpful. Based on the age of the property and the cost/nite the rooms are very outdated...the cooling system and noise level is very loud.

I would not recommend this property to anyone until they upgrade the cooling systems all the rooms.< /text>

Overpriced and under delivered.  Staff was tired and not interested in serving the customer.
Room Service was terrible
They placed Elite Marriott members in the smallest room....even with advanced reservation.  Don't ever use points for a stay at this Marriott unless you plan to sleep in the "closet"< /Text>

Most Marriott hotels are fine. Skip this one unless you enjoy hidden charges, toilets that overflow and unfriendly and unhelpful staff. If you like these things you'll love this property.<//text>

In July 2012 my family and 65 of our closest friends and family traveled 3000 miles to the Napa Valley Marriott to celebrate the marriage of my son and new daughter in law.  The actual wedding was held at another venue, but the Marriott was our home base for seven days. All of the staff from managers to housekeepers made us feel welcome.  Whether it was getting rental cars, sending faxes, getting wine openers, or meeting all of our guest in the lobby with wine and olives.  If I start writing about the food in the restaurant, I will run out of space so I will just say "AMAZING"  We could not have asked for a better experience.  If other Marriotts are half as good as Napa Valley, I wil never stay at any other hotel.

Overpriced because tourists will pay anything! Good facilities, plush health club and spa, 10 minutes to most wineries, good bar and average restaurant. Around 200 rooms, all pretty nice. Lots of conference or entertainment space.< /Review>

I've already provided the feedback. The staff did not warn me about a feather comforter after already asking about and getting the feather pillow replaced. It resulted in a poor night of sleeping.< /Review>

<review>Extremely friendly staff. Excellent location for any Napa Valley area events or excursions. And good food and wine for reasonable prices. The room and amenities were not what I would have expected for a Marriott hotel. Upon check in I noticed that a light bulb was out in the first entry way to the room. I immediately told the housekeeping staff who were next door. They said they'd alert maintenance.  3 days later I am checking out and it's still not been replaced. The shower/tub is very small and very basic. Also the TV would turn off at random times. You have to download an app to run it. There is no current program guidde so you have to guess what might br on a network. Also the wifi in the rooms and conference room was almost completely useless very slow and constant logged you out. I would have expected more from a high end resort which by the way you pay an extra $20 per night resort fee for.  Would I stay here again probably but it is because of the location and friendly staff Not the Marriott name.<//review></record>

<text>For the price of the room I would not stay at this property again.  We were not given the room we paid for. We encourage several issues with this hotel including : housekeeping left dirty cleaning supplies in our room, the location of the room was terrible (noisey), breakfast was undercooked, tried ordering room service one night and they messed the order up twice.</text><Time>1487030400000< /Time>< GmapID>

Honestly, I was not impressed.  The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  But the rooms were average at best, with no amenities at all.  This is NOT a resort hotel.  I wish we would have stayed at one of the places in Yountville instead.  Also, be prepared to be nickel and dimed to death here.  But what put them down to 2 stars with me was the restaurant.  They have decent food, but the service is terrible.  It takes forever to get a server, then forever to get a drink, then forever to get food.  The worst part, don't even try to open a bottle of wine from one the various beautiful vineyards that make this area the place to visit.  The restaurant staff flip out on you, even if you are in the courtyard and not at the restaurant, and then charge $15 dollars simply to sit there.  I have never, ever had to pay a corking fee in a common patio area at a resort before.  Ridiculous, especially for the cost of the place.  Use your money at a real resort instead and be treated the way you should, instead of like they are doing you a favor by staying with them.< /text>
