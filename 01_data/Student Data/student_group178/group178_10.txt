<Review>This is a really great, LOCAL place to support! There are a couple outdoor tables, but right now it is mostly take out or delivery. Pastries,  breads, sandwiches,  ALL made on site and very tasty. Good fair prices. Easy parking, front, back, and on street. You can join a text notifification for discount %. Wear your masks, and social distance, please. The owners are nice people too. Located in the Harvard Street District, just off Florida, near State.< /Review>< Time>

< Review>
if I could give more than 5 ☆ I would...my husband and I were in the area earlier in the week and we were hungry. I had a hankering for bakery items so I looked up *bakery near me* and Harvard Street bakery and cafe came up...they had 4.9 ☆ so of course I was sold! hubs and I tried a couple of their pastries and homemade soup. okay so this is going to sound strange but I swear the heavens opened up and I heard the angels!! this place IS A MUST!!! we ended up ordering our daughter's birthday cake here and it was literally THE BEST cake I've ever eaten. I cannot say enough about this place...never will I order a grocery store cake again! The owners are also very happy to accommodate and Laura is an absolute GEM! 😍<//Review>

GREAT pastries and baked goods.  Although the selection of available cup cakes, cakes, etc. varies daily; pretty much ANYTHING you want can be ordered a couple of days in advance.  We just enjoyed a dozen delicious cup cakes of various types we'd ordered that way.
While their prices are a bit higher than some, this IS a quality French style bakery and you definitely get your money's worth.<//review>

Super cute and cozy dining room, an absolutely lovely woman running the place, and a mouthwatering bakery case. Easy parking, great service, excellent prices.

I was shocked that we only spent $16 and change! We got a slice of Carrot Cake, a Chocolate Dipped Cheesecake, a Cannoli, 2 Chocolate Chip Cookies, a Brownie, and a Honey Bran Muffin that we split into small bites to share among 6 people. Definitely a good value for the price! ☺☺

It was all delicious, we'll definitely be back to visit again!</text>< pictures>

Who would have thought that among Temecula, Menifee and Hemet, Hemet would beat hands down the best bakery challenge? Tried them all, at least once, and yesterday after reading somewhere of the Harvard St Bakery and Cafe, I decided to go out of my comfort zone to Hemet to try the place. Yes, it took about 17 minutes each way, but the end results was well worth it.
In what appeared a downtown area resides this bakery. Grace took my order, and later Rose?, the owner, and apparently the one with the magic touch, appeared as well. Both extremely pleasant ladies, making the first time shopping experience a very nice one.
Bought a couple of breads, since at 2 in the afternoon on a Saturday, were the last to be found, no baguettes to be had. Also purchased several pastries, including a very delicious Banana Bread Pudding, with probably the best icing to put on top, given on the side. Very creamy, not too sweet, which kind of told the story of this place. If the icing is made with so much pride, then definitely this bakery, like good cream, rises to the top. The owner said that she could, and would prepare, most special requests, as I mentioned Dulce de Leche creations. I am also thinking about a German Apple Strudel with thin crust, and fresh apples.
One would think that I was a spring chicken, with unlimited capacity for good sweets, but that certainly is not the case, for we all, as a family do crave superior baked items, and when we are lucky to find a decent bakery we love it! Hard to find good quality, and we really enjoyed most of the selected pastries. Better than a Donut Shop, that’s for sure, since the products are not saturated with sugars to the point of no return. 4.5 Stars.</Text>

I was bummed out but decided to get the Victorian cake slice which I'm so glad i did it was soo good not to sweet or heavy, she did place an order for me for 2 pot pies which I picked up today. They were so delicious and flaky. I'm so glad I did decide to come back from the pot pies. Everyone is so nice and sweet.< /Review>< pics>

Fabulous bakery, exquisite treats, exceptional service! I ordered a couple dozen various treats for a small gathering at my home. Laura was so helpful and generous with her time and expertise, to guide me to just the perfect variety for all my guests! Everything I ordered was delicious as well as beautiful and my guests enjoyed every bite!< /review>

<Review>Amazing! Fantastic! Delicious! Cannot wait to go back and try new things! The cheesecake and danishes are to die for. The croissant breakfast sandwich is not only good, but big too. Everything is so reasonably priced. Wish I had gone here sooner, can't wait to go back!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Today was our second visit. Everything I’ve tried there so far was delicious. I just got the carrot cake and told them it’d be hard to beat my wife’s recipe, and... it was amazing! I’ll definitely be back to try a sandwich and/or quiche as well.<//Text>

I ordered a few cannolis, an almond crossiant, a chocolate crossiant, a cup of coffee with milk in it and a hot chocolate.
The almond and chocolate crossiants were still warm and flakey..delicious!  The cannoli was perfect! Delicious coffee and hit chocolate as well. Im very picky and they nailed it! I highly recommend them.
20 out of 5 stars! 😋🥰</Text>

The best chocolate cake I’ve had for a long time.  It is very moist and flavorful.  The chicken salad sandwich is definitely a do again. This little bakery is clean and cute, the owner is
welcoming and friendly.</review>

For the butter tart lover they make one that is above average with a flakey and buttery crust with a filling that is delicious and traditional.

I really don't know where to start, Laura is a sweet Beautiful lady who knows her way around the desserts hands down. She is my go to for all the sweets! We have 5 birthday's a year here in my house and good ole Laura comes to my rescue with cakes and cupcakes every year. There's not a year that goes by were everyone is asking where did I get the cake and or cupcakes, she's very creative and detail oriented - she has the ability to see your vision.  I recommend any and everyone to try her bakery... Also, if your a macaroon lover like myself... you won't be able to stay away! Hands down the best you'll ever have. Thank you Laura for my daughter's beautiful unicorn cupcakes you always #Rock<//review>

Picked up a special order Black Forest cake yesterday.  We will be tasting it shortly.

Update to the above.  That was one Delicious cake. The magic of a light chocolate cake lnfused with cherries and cherry schnapps was loved by all of my relatives, grandkids too, after Thanksgiving dinner.  We are going to have to repeat this again.<//Text>

I called several bakeries, in Hemet. I needed an excellent birthday cake and delivered, a.s.a.p, very next morning, 8am. I mean, I was looking for 5 star service and I got it! I'm over 300 miles from Hemet, this place rocked it! 5 stars to the Owner, Baker, and staff!!!<//text>

Great place. Clean, friendly and quaint. I eat their sandwiches often. You can't find any restaurants or sandwich shops nearby that roast their own turkey and slice it themselves. The chicken salad is home made fresh and delicious. They bake all their own breads not many can say that. You can taste the home made in everything.<//Review>

I was not feeling well and I got the dehydration drip with minerals and vitamins.  It was easy and quick.  Hailey was wonderful.   She is an RN so she knows her stuff.  I really liked Hailey.    A few hours later I felt brand new.</Review>

Beatrix continues to be the most amazing hydration nurse. She is prompt, great company, knowledgeable and really cares about her patients. I have a chronic illness and need the fluids weekly so when I can’t make it into the lab, she comes the same day! I fully recommend Drip to everyone!< /Text>

<Text>Beatrice was awesome. She was prompt, professional, and fun to hang out with. She met my co-worker and I up at work and hooked us up (pun intended). Would definitely use drip hydration in the future for on the go IVs needs.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2b8afe05d0615:0x3dacefcb7d12b90f</GmapID></record>

I've been looking for this type of service in Bay Area for a long time. Finally found Drip Hydration. Very good service, booked in the middle of the night, nurse arrived 9am. Everyone is very professional, friendly. Sure helps with hangover. Highly recommended.</text>

Quick, easy, friendly. Worked very well for recovery from severe dehydration. Doctor recommended an IV at urgent care but this option was much simpler and faster.<//text>

I caught a bad stomach bug and was vomiting nonstop for 14+ hrs.... I got the stomach flu hydration drip and didn’t vomit again after! I’m a nurse and I knew exactly what I needed, and they did not disappoint, plus I didn’t have to leave my couch! The only reason I didn’t give them 5 stars is the price - an extra bag of fluid cost $100 extra .... but all in all, I got better & couldn’t be more thankful for the convenience!<//review>

Incredibly easy and fast service.
I booked a time less than an hour in advance and low and behold the very kind practitioner was here within the hour.
Wonderful service and professionalism.< /Text>

I was very sick but would rather die alone in a hotel room than go to Downtown Los Angeles’ emergency room. It was honestly a bit scary being as sick as I was while traveling alone for work. The nurse was AMAZING and kind. I felt relief very quickly after the zofran and could actually talk and update my friends and family after the hydration. I was so happy to have this service and be taken care of. They were prompt and professional but most of all very caring!< /text>

This was a great experience. I was waiting at the ER for more than 3 hours to be seen for dehydration from a travel flu/virus. Within 45 minutes, they had a wonderful nurse at my apartment to give me an IV with extra meds to help with nausea. She even stayed another hour so that I could get an extra IV bag. 10/10 would recommend this company if you need a caring and informative person to ease your dehydration-related suffering< /Text>

Day was great and would recommend their service.  My wife would typically have to go to the ER that would have taken a long time not to mention sitting in a room of a bunch sick people.   Day showed up 1.5 hours after I called their service.  She was professional and knew what she was doing.<//Review>

Flexibility of coming to our location, the quality of the service, great customer service, and overall outsmarting experience. Above all, the IV helped me bounce back from a full day of drinking.

<text>I came down with the stomach flu on the day of my sister's wedding. Couldn't stand for more than 20 mins without vomiting. It's not cheep, but they got me on my feet; feeling well enough to participate in the whole wedding. I stood with my sister during the ceremony, took photos, ate a little dinner, delivered my speech, and even put forth a good effort on the dance floor before I felt the chills coming back. 2 pm - midnight. This is not a cure, it treats the symptoms; I spent the whole next day in bed.

They were professional, kind, and efficient. This is the kind of thing America does best. If you can pay, then they will be there with bows on and you'll be dancing with your sister while the wedding band covers 🤴 prince.<//text><Name>John Tedham<//Name>< rate>

<Text>I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy and increase my overall health. I've been hearing that IV drips can be great for that, so I just had to try it! I went with Drip Hydration because they actually comes to your house which is so convenient and set me at ease. It was such an easy process with no pain. They said day one you tend to feel relaxed and then day two get a boost of energy. I definitely felt awesome on day 2. Didn't need my typical coffee to get me going. I'll definitely be using them again. If you've ever been curious definitely give them a ring their prices are awesome!<//Text><date>1523551656257</date>< UserId.>

Drip Hydration has to be one of the best mobile IV services I’ve  tried. I have tried multiple services in Vegas and a few mobile services in the LA area.  The only reason I can say this is cause the RN that was assigned by the name of Angeline treated our bachelor party with the best experience I’ve ever enjoyed from a mobile IV service. She was kind, professional, funny, and made every single one of my friends first experience a rememberable one. We enjoyed her service so much we would go to her every time we come into LA. Thanx again Angeline !!!!<//Text>

<Text>A friend referred me to Drip Hydration when I was in town battling a raging cold.  I submitted a same-day appointment request online and received a call a few minutes later confirming my appointment and package.  The nurse Zoryana arrive promptly was clearly an expert at performing home IV treatments.  She made me feel very comfortable, and about 40 minutes later the treatment was done and I was feeling better already.  I couldn't have imagined trying to drink that much fluid on my own and would highly recommend this service for anyone in LA!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1494957987310, 'text': 'So glad our IV Hydration Vitamin Drip Cold remedy worked for you!'}< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2b8afe05d0615:0x3dacefcb7d12b90f<//gmap_id></record>

I went out for a weekend to Coachella, a well known music festival and I had partied pretty hard....  When I came back to reality the next week, I was working long hours, fatigued, and quite dehydrated. So I booked an appointment with LIVE Hydration and the response time was awesome.  Being a 1st time user I was curious on how well my response would be.... the Next day I was feeling energetic and back to my normal self!  Definitely worth the service when you can skip a weeks worth of recovery.</review>

I used to take vitamin pills and eat lots of fruits but I would still get sick every 2 or 3 months. I tried Drip Hydration’s immune boost 4 months ago and have gone all that time without a cold!</Text>

The 7/11 is convenient you if you need to pick up something or if you have to wait for your pizza order.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Ordered online ahead of time and got there and it still took 20 extra minutes for it to be done "hot and ready" not even close this location is always garbage. Workers were in the back not even checking in on the 5 plus people waiting for orders and assistance. I rather drive further because it will still be ready quicker than this location< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c295891161a8bf:0x42ae4a8667e5c558<//gmap_id></record>

< Review>
I wish there was a 1/2 rating because this place seems to always be closed. I am not sure if it has to do anything with Covid-19 hours, but every time I have walked over to this location there's a sign on their door that says "Sorry Closed for Maintenance". How much does it need? I have walked over about 5 times in the last two weeks and it has been closed. I finally call before I head over and no one ever picks up the phone.</Review>

<review>If you order a pizza online it should be ready at the time they promise you. I get there. I am told to wait. 30 minutes after the time my pizza is suppose to be ready, it’s not. On top of all this. I don’t even get the pizza that I paid for. Not such a good experience at this location.</review>< pics>

Who ever prepared the pizza tonight did an awesome job!! I wish it could always be this way. The perfect amount of tomato sauce, cheese and Pepperoni. Even the cheese pizza was perfect tonight. Most of the time it's either dry, or not enough cheese or only half of the slice of the pizza has sauce,cheese and pepperoni  and the other half is plain crust. It's never consistent.<//review>

Sometimes there is a wait if a pizza is not immediately available, but it's usually short and the plus side is your pizza will be super fresh. On the downside this particular NH location doesn't seem to have sufficient parking (the tight space is shared with a 7-11, Thai rest, and a cell phone store). However if you can find a spot and are patient, it's a super deal.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>HORRIBLE. Ordered by phone and was told 15 minutes. Gave them extra time to prep the food, drove ALL THE WAY there which too 20 minutes, stood in line, and when I got to the counter the guy said he forgot to put the order in, they didn't offer an apology or anything. These people are idiots - they had 1 job and couldn't even do it right. Not to mention the store had a horrible smell and was very dirty when I got there.

Horrible expierence here the cashier at this location wouldn't give a lady who was waiting in line for a very long time her refund!  The lines were getting longer and even one of the people ordering told the cashier to go ahead and assist the lady for her refund and he said no it takes a little longer frustrated the lady and everyone waiting for their order cahsier then went back and got busy and didn't come back, sorry i walked out! I felt bad for the lady waiting for her refund and she was upset i dont know why the cashier was making it hard and didn't just give her money back so people could get going! So weird! No pizza for me tonight! 😒 this location needs a revamp on employees or needs to train better or someone else needs to manage this place better something has to give can't have a pizza place known for pizzas made and ready to go be empty and behind on help or whatever excuse there might be! You would also think the customer is first because without us customers you wouldn't be in business!< /review>

Awesome this is a good pizza place! But, they can make mistakes. At least they lower the price. They are nice to other customers. I only rated 5 so you can see this. I would rate 4 because its not exactly hot n ready you have to wait 20 mins or 10 mins sometimes ( only for special pizza's: DEEP! DEEP! DISH, Meat Lovers, ect; ) .If you call say it clearly and make it so they can understand what your saying.<//Text>

<Review>Really amazing little place! It's filled with all sorts of cured meats that they butchered. It has a lot of unique types of meats and flavors. The staff is very knowledgeable about the meats and happy to answer any questions. The meats are well priced and Very yummy! They also have some meat pies you can buy for a quick meal on the go.< /Review><user>100022159400084386784</user>< Rating>

The best! I don't buy my meat anywhere else. So friendly, and fresh tasty product every time. I had a specialty ask today - making my own beef jerky - and had a bunch of questions. They were very knowledgeable and patient. I've never been disappointed, even during the heart of Covid last summer when they were running low. They were kind enough to let us know to prepare for shortages around July 4, when BBQing is typically at its highest. That is a level of customer service you just don't get everywhere. Big ups!</Text>

Have bought short ribs, eye of round for jerky, brisket, and much  more. They will do a custom cut and weight on anything there. They do not charge an arm or leg for any custom cuts, unless you are buying an arm or leg!!!!
LOL
My place forever for meats.
Highly recommended.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Good tri tip prices and carne asada. I got the marinated skirt steak recently and it was very good. Previously got marinated tri tip and it was very salty, over-marinated, but generally, I love this little store, good selection.< /Review>< userid>

Jennifer was extremely nice and helpful. I felt very comfortable with her and her knowledge of the different plans and cell. phones. Jennifer is definitely a pleasant person to go to US Cellular for anything you need regarding you cell phone needs. I highly recommend her any promotions that US Cellular may have for their employees. Thank you again Jennifer.

I stopped into the store needing some accessories for my phone. Jennifer Banner was AWESOME and the most knowledgeable sales associate I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. She made sure to explain all of the accessories I was looking at and helped make the best choices for me. She is now my go to for anything cell phone related! Thank you so much Jennifer, they are lucky to have you!</review>

My Dad and I were having some issues with our phone and bill. We spoke to a gentleman named Chris at this location. He was super friendly and greeted us with a smile. I explained that our bill was high and didn't understand why. He noticed that we were on an old plan with old phones and looked at how much data we actually use. He got us both new phones and a better plan and Im saving money!!! I highly recommend Chris for fast friendly amazing service!!!<//text>

I am not very tech savvy but the people @ US Cellular in Willits are always so pleasant and helpful. I especially like Jennifer Banner for going out of her way to help me. However whether it is her, Chris or Jose I know they will help me figure it out with a smile. It is because of this store I will continue to keep and recommend US Cellular New Trend Wireless.<//Text>

Wow...I'm blown away by how knowledgeable representative Jennifer Banner is when it comes to technology and cellular networks in general. Not the usual as far as cell phone sales reps I've dealt with in the past and far beyond the customer service I've received in the Ukiah store! You can tell that she loves her job...which makes me love being a customer.

Thank you, US Cellular, for hiring someone as great as Jennifer Banner!!</review>

I’ve purchased 2 models of iPhones over the years at Willits US Cellular and both times Jose Garcia has educated me on the operation of the phones. He is extremely knowledgeable regarding the workings of the phones and the technicalities that haunt us older folks. His friendliness and patience are beyond compare and I’ve been back in for his help when I don’t have a clue!!! My hat’s off to you Jose!!
Thanks for all the help and understanding!!</text>

I just got my new phone. Jennifer Banner was so helpful. Not only did I get the perfect phone, I can use my phone when I go visit family in the mountains and when I work out of town. I’m very thankful to have a place like U.S. Cellular in Willits.< /Text>

<Text>Find it funny that like the review that states "it isn't truly unlimited" well neither is the service provider you mentioned. News flash no provider has TRUE unlimited. These guys are down to earth and will help you if you are a real person. Don't expect great customer service when you treat employees like dirt.</Text>< username>

I paid my bill today and my phone has not restored service. Not cool. Plus the unlimited plan is not actually unlimited. I've gone half this month without any internet service. Don't use us cellular. Use Verizon and you get better service.< /review>

Willits us cellular is awesome, it’s the only contract cell phone place in Willits and it has a top of the line selection of phones, the employees are also top of the line, I really was delighted to be helped out by Jennifer Banner when buying two new iPhones for the first time, she helped me to make a quick and good decision. I hope everyone has an enjoyable experience like I did at willits new trend wireless<//review>

The service is good. Sometimes they don't have all the desals the official us cellular stores have but this place helps you fix problems. They take the time to help. The store itself is well kept and has a good selection of accessories.<//Review>

I paid my cell phone at this location on Friday and have a receipt to prove it. Apparently it was not recorded right and now my phone service is cut off! It's Sunday after 5pm and I cannot get anyone to help me and when I call 611 they say they cannot turn it on until there financial department is open which is not until Monday morning. I've been on hold with the US cellular operator for over 45 minutes & counting waiting to talk to a supervisor!!!!<//review>

First time coming in with my husband today, and I was absolutely amazed by the quality of the food! I had the fried fish, pasta, rice, tuna salad, salad, carrots, burger and all of it was fantastic! My favorite dish was the pineapple pizza! Oh and the cookies 🙂<//Text>

Terrible time fluctuations. The website says they open at 5:30 so I woke up early over my 72 to walk there and the door was open so I walked in. Some lady then told me that they were closed and won’t be opening until 6:30. This has happened on multiple occasions even some resulting in me completely missing the chow hall in general. Please update your times on google.!!< /Review>

Never any parking. Always packed. Parking lot has no lights. other chow halls seem to never have any problems like this. I’ve been stationed here for 2 years and it never gets any better... definitely would NOT recommend.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc6f9bd67103cf:0xc2dbdeba132b29b7< /Gmap_id></record>

My first experience in a USMC mess hall. The company they contracted knows how to take care of them. Well kept, clean, and seemingly fresh food. Employees were cordial.</Text>

Lazy, incompetent staff, especially the cooks, who either undercook chicken or dont make enough. Frequently have seen mice/bugs while eating. Undoubtedly they violate health code violations🤗< /Review>

This is a great mess hall.  It's not fancy, but the food is good.  The servers are nice and always have a smile.  Theré are windoes that are opened to let the ocean air in.  This is my favorite chow hall!

The only bad thing (and this is only recently) is their grilled chicken breast. It has been very dry and tough.  Im not sure why the change.  They must have a new cook for the chicken breast.  It's pretty awful.</review>

Dry Khadavi saved my skin! I’ve had systemic adult acne for over 10 years. I always always embarrassed by my hyperpigmentation and hormonal breakouts. I got a chemical peel and a few microdermabrasions along with prescription meds and my skin has done a 180! No breakouts and my dark marks are starting to fade. I highly recommend coming to this office. This staff is really nice and helpful.< /review>

<Text>I visited his office in Thousand Oaks early in March for Botox injection.  I have gone to him few times and each visit I noticed that the injections are not less effective than the prior time and not sure if the med was   diluted not!  He is always 30-45 minutes late to his appointment.  Rudely he doesn’t apologize and down talks to the patient. NO BEDSIDE MANNERS.
On my last visit I asked him to inject shots under my eyebrow for a better lift. He completely disregarded my ask and injected more shot on my forehead which equaled to more money. I paid $360 , $12 a unit which was the most I have ever injected!!

Few days later my eyelids started drooping and I looked puffy and tired. The wrinkles on my forehead were still there!  I did contact his office and expressed my concern and dissatisfaction and was given an appointment an hour from the time I called. I had to leave work hoping he will correct the mess he did on my face.  Again after waiting 45 minutes for him to see me, he abruptly entered the room and start talking rudely to me stating that nothing is wrong!!! Then he yelled at his nurse why my prior to injection shots were not handed to him. Then he stormed out of the room and nurse followed him and shut the door on my face. At the time I was shocked of his unprofessional and rude behavior.  So I peaked my head out and asked the nurse what is going on. The dr screamed from across the hall way saying” GET BACK IN THE TOOM AND SHUT THE DOOR. CANT YOU UNDERSTAND WE ATE GETTING THE PHOTOS. GET BACK IN A THERE.   This was the final draw for me. I left the office and complained to front desk of Dr behavior and unprofessional staff. I have disputed the payment and going to post my experience and review hoping no other patient go through the same horrible experience and disrespect.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Dr Khadavi is very honest, which i really appreciate. He gives his recommendations, but does not try to push or upsell any treatments. I see him for both medical (rosacea) and aesthetic reasons. Abida is really great as well, very skilled with the laser procedures. I highly recommend this office.</Review>

I’ve been going to Encino dermatology for years. Dr K has me on a skin regimen that leaves my skin glowing & in check for hopefully preventing skin cancer! The aestheticians & front desk staff are top notch.< /review>

Dr. Khadavi is a true artist and great doctor. He has injected me with fillers and even treated my thinning hair. He really knows his stuff. He erased years off my face and gave me hope about having a full head of hair. I am a treatment plan and am excited about the future. I always feel like he has my best interests at heart and wants me to be the best version of me possible. He is a one of a kind.<//Text>

< Review>
I’ve only gone to them twice so far- once for an initial dermatology exam and once for microdermabrasion - so this review may be altered at some point. The receptionists told me multiple times that my appointments would be covered by my insurance and that the only thing I had to pay out of pocket would be the copay. This is the case with my primary care doctor, so it didn’t seem out of the ordinary. They had my insurance information at this point, and I specifically asked (multiple times) because I didn’t want any surprises bills. Well, I got surprise bills. Make sure you check THROUGH YOUR INSURANCE about your coverage at this office. Do not trust their receptionists, they have no idea what they’re talking about. Also, be wary of parking! The street parking is very limited and I got a parking ticket on my second visit that I am contesting due to misplaced and unclear signage. Several other cars had these tickets on them as well when I came out, so if you are unsure about the signs, I suggest opting for safety and parking elsewhere.</Review>

<Text>My family and I have been with Dr. Khadavi forever. He’s a great doctor, very knowledgeable and has always gone out of his way to help, how often do you find that?
His office is always up on the latest technology, nothing old and dusty here. His offices are always clean and his staff professional and kind.
My only sort of complaint in the past has been the long waits, but he listened to his patients and has added more staff and increased his hours to see patients. For example, I had an appointment today and planned on being there at least 1.5 hrs, but my appt was on time and I was out in 30 mins. and never felt rushed!
Thank you Dr. Khadavi for your dedication and top notch care!< /Text>< userid>

<Date>1568914684717< /Date><Rate>4< /Rate><review>I entered this procedure not knowing anything. I was not given a consultation before the receptionist handed me numbing cream to put all over my face. I did it, avoiding my eyes but putting it on my forehead not knowing juvederm would not be used on my forehead, and not knowing where the injections would be administered. That would have been helpful to know ahead of the numbing. The rest of the day my eyelids were numb and my eyes stung like crazy.

I asked that my lips be given a little boost and ended up with an entire syringe of juvederm. I was not expecting the result.

The nurse was good and tried hard not to hurt me. It was not bad at all. The next day i was black and blue on one side and of course needle marks all over my lips and in certain places on my face; nasal labial and cheek. Day 2 and I still look a mess. I'm assured all will be well. Stay tuned. :)<//review>< pics>

Very Unorganized and surprised that a physician would actually hire them. I had asked if a certain procedure was covered under insurance, and repeatedly was told yes.  Multiple times.  Even at the office.  Only to find out after the procedure was done that nothing was covered.  What kind of mickey mouse doctor's office is this? When it came to actual dermatology practice, even worse.  Horrible treatment, and even worse bedside manner. Do yourself a favor, go ahead and find a better doctor! There are tons that will take the time and have a bedside manner that will allow for you to get treated diligently.  Don't bother with this place! WORST WORST SERVICE AND CARE I HAVE EVER SEEN! I only gave them 1 star because Google won't allow less. They deserve Negative stars. These people are idiots. As mentioned in the other review, I'd be surprised if Mcdonald's even hired this staff.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I love Dr Khadavi! He is extremely knowledgeable and does a wonderful job.  The nurses in his office are the greatest, especially Laura. My only criticism is  that I would like to know the costs of the procedures beforehand — also, the receipts are very vague and unreadable.</Review>

My wife had a basic appointment here, was told over the phone that it was covered under our insurance 100%. When she went in for the appointment, she asked again if everything was covered 100% and they told her yes. She just moved here from England, where seeing the doctor is always free, so of course wanted to make sure before being charged anything. We just now got a massive bill (months later) that we were not expecting at all. In the process of inquiring at the number at the top of the bill, my wife spoke to the manager of accounts there and she laughed at my wife on the phone, saying sarcastically “oh, now that’s a good one,” referring to her believing that the visit was covered 100% based on what she was told before and during the visit. My wife then in tears after that conversation, I called back and spoke to Susan there who said “oh yeah, my manager just spoke to her” and proceeded to argue with me that it was our responsibility to see what was covered by our insurance before booking the appointment, and was also very rude to me, and threatened to hurt my wife’s credit that she’s barely even started here if we don’t pay. We canceled all future appointments here, we feel conned, and had the worst customer service experience ever.< /review>

<review>Alex Khadavi is an amazing doctor!!!! He can miraculously fix anything with your skin -- taking away blemishes, freckles, moles, lumps or any imperfection that other dermatologists refuse to treat. What a great experience seeing Dr Khadavi for the past 7 yrs or so :-)).. (And he was always super helpful in using my insurance for most procedures) Now that I live in S Fco I still come to LA to see him when I need an excellent skin doctor.<//review></record>

I’m not sure where or who to start with.  My experience was ah-mazing!!!!
Unfortunately I’ve had more than my fair share of doctors & clinics due to a rare disease, infertility & orthopedic surgeries.  Hands down this is the best medical experience I’ve ever had.  I wish every patient could be treated this well from every doctor’s office.
Dr K is so sweet, informative, caring & compassionate.  He has a lot of celebrity clientele.  I’m just an average person, but I was treated like a VIP.  He’s a great listener & remembered things about our previous visit.  I think he’s a fantastic dr & would recommend him to anyone & everyone.
His staff is so friendly & sweet.  I just looooove Dolph.  He is such a great ambassador for the clinic.  He answered every question & addressed my concerns as well.  Dolph is so accessible too.  You can tell he loves his job & helping others.
Nicole in the clinic deserves to be acknowledged for her kindness too!  She is so super helpful & fun to be around.
I can’t say enough great things about my experience.  I wish they were in my state!  Luckily they’re just a short trip away.

The service I receieved was fillers.  It’s so soon after my service but I think I will be happy with my results.

You will be super happy you went with Dr Khadavi & his clinic!</Text>

The receptionists are the most incompetent, unorganized & deviod of common since people I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with in 45 years! They failed to tell me to bring coins for parking; or that parking is limited to only 2 hrs; or that I needed to call them upon arrival to be let into the bld. I stood outside for 15 mins in the HEAT waiting to be let in. Further, they never bothered to check ( at the time I scheduled my appointment over the phone) to make sure I had an up-to-date referral for my "Worker's Comp'" case. So, I traveled 45 mi's round trip, & 120 mins drive FOR NOTHING!!! I only gave them 1 star because Google won't allow less. They deserve -5 stars. These people are idiots. Some people should be restricted to working at Mc Donald's!!!</Text>

I suffered for 7 long years the bumps and the unpleasant look of my lips, until one date I visited Doctor Khadavi’s practice in Encino.  Doctor Alex Khadavi assured me that he can ‘touch my face’ to have a  joyful look  ( with injectable) and re-do my lips.  I saw the intelligent look in his eyes and the experience of his professional life to use the needdle. I  also recognized the pride that he puts in his work to make you look beautiful.

I was referred to Dr. Khadavi by a good friend who has had several services for him.  I had been wanting to try Voluma in my cheeks but was nervous as I have only had shorter term filler in my face and wanted to be sure I was going to someone who I could trust to give me the results I wanted.  After meeting him and having seen the work he'd done for my friend I felt confident in the procedures and also inquired about a botox brow lift and a touch up on my lips.  Dr. Khadavi was so knowledgeable in everything and his assistants had me nicely numbed up and with his gentle technique I surprisingly had no pain and unbelievably no bruising!  I ended up receiving cheek and chin work with Voluma as well as lips, dysport, and also have started using his Revivogen Hair Care line (shampoo, conditioner, and hair regrowth drops so far) and love everything!! Highly recommend him for injectables and hair regrowth ...will update review soon with photos from before and after and to expand review after I have returned for skincare services and mesotherapy!!!< /Text>

I have never encountered any doctor with such horrible bedside manners, or manners in general. He was short, beyond rude and even aggressive. Please save yourself the time and money and go to another derm/med spa in the area.<//Text>

Dry Khadavi saved my skin! I’ve had systemic adult acne for over 10 years. I always always embarrassed by my hyperpigmentation and hormonal breakouts. I got a chemical peel and a few microdermabrasions along with prescription meds and my skin has done a 180! No breakouts and my dark marks are starting to fade. I highly recommend coming to this office. This staff is really nice and helpful.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I visited his office in Thousand Oaks early in March for Botox injection.  I have gone to him few times and each visit I noticed that the injections are not less effective than the prior time and not sure if the med was   diluted not!  He is always 30-45 minutes late to his appointment.  Rudely he doesn’t apologize and down talks to the patient. NO BEDSIDE MANNERS.
On my last visit I asked him to inject shots under my eyebrow for a better lift. He completely disregarded my ask and injected more shot on my forehead which equaled to more money. I paid $360 , $12 a unit which was the most I have ever injected!!

Few days later my eyelids started drooping and I looked puffy and tired. The wrinkles on my forehead were still there!  I did contact his office and expressed my concern and dissatisfaction and was given an appointment an hour from the time I called. I had to leave work hoping he will correct the mess he did on my face.  Again after waiting 45 minutes for him to see me, he abruptly entered the room and start talking rudely to me stating that nothing is wrong!!! Then he yelled at his nurse why my prior to injection shots were not handed to him. Then he stormed out of the room and nurse followed him and shut the door on my face. At the time I was shocked of his unprofessional and rude behavior.  So I peaked my head out and asked the nurse what is going on. The dr screamed from across the hall way saying” GET BACK IN THE TOOM AND SHUT THE DOOR. CANT YOU UNDERSTAND WE ATE GETTING THE PHOTOS. GET BACK IN A THERE.   This was the final draw for me. I left the office and complained to front desk of Dr behavior and unprofessional staff. I have disputed the payment and going to post my experience and review hoping no other patient go through the same horrible experience and disrespect.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Dr Khadavi is very honest, which i really appreciate. He gives his recommendations, but does not try to push or upsell any treatments. I see him for both medical (rosacea) and aesthetic reasons. Abida is really great as well, very skilled with the laser procedures. I highly recommend this office.< /Review><rating>5<//rating><time>1628115953893<//time><Name>Kristin Traynor< /Name><pictures>None< /pictures><GmapID>0x80c298276cf4f991:0xb668455a514e875< /GmapID>< user_id>

<review>Do not get close in any way, this doctor causes damage to the face, if you had something that bothers you in the facial area, he will make it worse and then worse and then if you come in complaint he will shout at you and throw you in disgrace!  If I could give 0 stars I would give one star it is too much!!!!!< /review>< Pics>

Dr. Khadavi is a true artist and great doctor. He has injected me with fillers and even treated my thinning hair. He really knows his stuff. He erased years off my face and gave me hope about having a full head of hair. I am a treatment plan and am excited about the future. I always feel like he has my best interests at heart and wants me to be the best version of me possible. He is a one of a kind.< /Review>

I’ve only gone to them twice so far- once for an initial dermatology exam and once for microdermabrasion - so this review may be altered at some point. The receptionists told me multiple times that my appointments would be covered by my insurance and that the only thing I had to pay out of pocket would be the copay. This is the case with my primary care doctor, so it didn’t seem out of the ordinary. They had my insurance information at this point, and I specifically asked (multiple times) because I didn’t want any surprises bills. Well, I got surprise bills. Make sure you check THROUGH YOUR INSURANCE about your coverage at this office. Do not trust their receptionists, they have no idea what they’re talking about. Also, be wary of parking! The street parking is very limited and I got a parking ticket on my second visit that I am contesting due to misplaced and unclear signage. Several other cars had these tickets on them as well when I came out, so if you are unsure about the signs, I suggest opting for safety and parking elsewhere.</review>

<text>My family and I have been with Dr. Khadavi forever. He’s a great doctor, very knowledgeable and has always gone out of his way to help, how often do you find that?
His office is always up on the latest technology, nothing old and dusty here. His offices are always clean and his staff professional and kind.
My only sort of complaint in the past has been the long waits, but he listened to his patients and has added more staff and increased his hours to see patients. For example, I had an appointment today and planned on being there at least 1.5 hrs, but my appt was on time and I was out in 30 mins. and never felt rushed!
Thank you Dr. Khadavi for your dedication and top notch care!<//text>< pictures>

I entered this procedure not knowing anything. I was not given a consultation before the receptionist handed me numbing cream to put all over my face. I did it, avoiding my eyes but putting it on my forehead not knowing juvederm would not be used on my forehead, and not knowing where the injections would be administered. That would have been helpful to know ahead of the numbing. The rest of the day my eyelids were numb and my eyes stung like crazy.

I asked that my lips be given a little boost and ended up with an entire syringe of juvederm. I was not expecting the result.

The nurse was good and tried hard not to hurt me. It was not bad at all. The next day i was black and blue on one side and of course needle marks all over my lips and in certain places on my face; nasal labial and cheek. Day 2 and I still look a mess. I'm assured all will be well. Stay tuned. :)<//Review>

< review>
The secretaries are complete imbeciles. Very Unorganized and surprised that a physician would actually hire them. I had asked if a certain procedure was covered under insurance, and repeatedly was told yes.  Multiple times.  Even at the office.  Only to find out after the procedure was done that nothing was covered.  What kind of mickey mouse doctor's office is this? When it came to actual dermatology practice, even worse.  Horrible treatment, and even worse bedside manner. Do yourself a favor, go ahead and find a better doctor! There are tons that will take the time and have a bedside manner that will allow for you to get treated diligently.  Don't bother with this place! WORST WORST SERVICE AND CARE I HAVE EVER SEEN! I only gave them 1 star because Google won't allow less. They deserve Negative stars. These people are idiots. As mentioned in the other review, I'd be surprised if Mcdonald's even hired this staff.<//review>

I love Dr Khadavi! He is extremely knowledgeable and does a wonderful job.  The nurses in his office are the greatest, especially Laura. My only criticism is  that I would like to know the costs of the procedures beforehand — also, the receipts are very vague and unreadable.< /text>

<text>My wife had a basic appointment here, was told over the phone that it was covered under our insurance 100%. When she went in for the appointment, she asked again if everything was covered 100% and they told her yes. She just moved here from England, where seeing the doctor is always free, so of course wanted to make sure before being charged anything. We just now got a massive bill (months later) that we were not expecting at all. In the process of inquiring at the number at the top of the bill, my wife spoke to the manager of accounts there and she laughed at my wife on the phone, saying sarcastically “oh, now that’s a good one,” referring to her believing that the visit was covered 100% based on what she was told before and during the visit. My wife then in tears after that conversation, I called back and spoke to Susan there who said “oh yeah, my manager just spoke to her” and proceeded to argue with me that it was our responsibility to see what was covered by our insurance before booking the appointment, and was also very rude to me, and threatened to hurt my wife’s credit that she’s barely even started here if we don’t pay. We canceled all future appointments here, we feel conned, and had the worst customer service experience ever.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Alex Khadavi is an amazing doctor!!!! He can miraculously fix anything with your skin -- taking away blemishes, freckles, moles, lumps or any imperfection that other dermatologists refuse to treat. What a great experience seeing Dr Khadavi for the past 7 yrs or so :-)).. (And he was always super helpful in using my insurance for most procedures) Now that I live in S Fco I still come to LA to see him when I need an excellent skin doctor.</text><username>Natalia Folcini</username><date>1479493459572</date><Rate>5<//Rate>< pictures>

Unfortunately I’ve had more than my fair share of doctors & clinics due to a rare disease, infertility & orthopedic surgeries.  Hands down this is the best medical experience I’ve ever had.  I wish every patient could be treated this well from every doctor’s office.
Dr K is so sweet, informative, caring & compassionate.  He has a lot of celebrity clientele.  I’m just an average person, but I was treated like a VIP.  He’s a great listener & remembered things about our previous visit.  I think he’s a fantastic dr & would recommend him to anyone & everyone.
His staff is so friendly & sweet.  I just looooove Dolph.  He is such a great ambassador for the clinic.  He answered every question & addressed my concerns as well.  Dolph is so accessible too.  You can tell he loves his job & helping others.
Nicole in the clinic deserves to be acknowledged for her kindness too!  She is so super helpful & fun to be around.
I can’t say enough great things about my experience.  I wish they were in my state!  Luckily they’re just a short trip away.

The service I receieved was fillers.  It’s so soon after my service but I think I will be happy with my results.

You will be super happy you went with Dr Khadavi & his clinic!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c298276cf4f991:0xb668455a514e875<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The receptionists are the most incompetent, unorganized & deviod of common since people I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with in 45 years! They failed to tell me to bring coins for parking; or that parking is limited to only 2 hrs; or that I needed to call them upon arrival to be let into the bld. I stood outside for 15 mins in the HEAT waiting to be let in. Further, they never bothered to check ( at the time I scheduled my appointment over the phone) to make sure I had an up-to-date referral for my "Worker's Comp'" case. So, I traveled 45 mi's round trip, & 120 mins drive FOR NOTHING!!! I only gave them 1 star because Google won't allow less. They deserve -5 stars. These people are idiots. Some people should be restricted to working at Mc Donald's!!!<//Text>< pictures>

I don’t have enough words to express my gratitude to Doctor Alex Khadavi for fixing my lips. I suffered for 7 long years the bumps and the unpleasant look of my lips, until one date I visited Doctor Khadavi’s practice in Encino.  Doctor Alex Khadavi assured me that he can ‘touch my face’ to have a  joyful look  ( with injectable) and re-do my lips.  I saw the intelligent look in his eyes and the experience of his professional life to use the needdle. I  also recognized the pride that he puts in his work to make you look beautiful.  You can trust and have confidence with this Doctor.<//text>

After meeting him and having seen the work he'd done for my friend I felt confident in the procedures and also inquired about a botox brow lift and a touch up on my lips.  Dr. Khadavi was so knowledgeable in everything and his assistants had me nicely numbed up and with his gentle technique I surprisingly had no pain and unbelievably no bruising!  I ended up receiving cheek and chin work with Voluma as well as lips, dysport, and also have started using his Revivogen Hair Care line (shampoo, conditioner, and hair regrowth drops so far) and love everything!! Highly recommend him for injectables and hair regrowth ...will update review soon with photos from before and after and to expand review after I have returned for skincare services and mesotherapy!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>This was our staging and starting point for a 4x4 run call Empire miners that ended around Chalk Bluff staging area.  Really nice run.  Also a great place for area hikers, place gets full about 9am.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8gi_lAEiP3GtaPqjLGq-ZtOUaG9SxEvxp9eYQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvMKbFMUCNVaBU8useopUBeqZwM5G_c9LvDoeQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

This trail is a little less marked than some of the others in this area but a pleasant walk regardless of the direction you choose. You just might need to turn around or avoid vehicles depending on your choice.</review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>An absolute beautiful day out on the trail. The smells of the flowers were incredible. And it was the perfect temperature around 9:00 a.m..  The trail as perfect for strollers walkers playing your dog or ride your horse. It's big enough and well maintained for everyone.<//Text><username>Misha Herrera<//username><GmapID>0x809b7035ec9734a1:0x9a8a839442302fec<//GmapID><user>114316502168296613926</user><date>1560102732714</date>< Resp>

Amazingly convenient access point to the trails of Empire Mine State Park.  Note that this is not the main entrance, so there are no services available, but parking is free.</review>

Walk this trail daily. People are always friendly! That's what I love about this area. Could use a little more brush clearing now and then but then again it's a State Park. The trails are easy for anyone to walk, run or use for horses... Or the occasional alpaca!< /Review>

<Text>Amazing. Seems urban from the trail parking lots but you'll quickly forget about the streets and cars a few minutes into your walk. Lots of deer paths and side trails to explore which makes return visits feel like your first time again.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Text>Lots of dogs, people and horses today.  The park has miles of trails, at least 6 mining ruins, a seasonal Creek and lots of wild flowers in the spring.  Parking and trails are free and maps are available from the Empire Mine visitor center.  The pictures show what is left of the hand rivited 22 inch diameter water pipe that was built in the 1880s to take  water from the reservoir below the club house at the Empire Mine to the North Star Mine.  The water was used to power both mines replacing steam engines.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<response>None< /response><Review>Awesome hole in the wall restaurant.   Food is excellent.  Menu changes so does their pastries so call in or check their website.   They have bakery with desserts, its delicious too.  The flan and other cakes are good.  If you like cakes that are dense then buy some.  Cakes are good with flavor 😋👌 just a bit dense for me.  Oh the Ube (taro) hochata and calamansi juice are bomb. See pics.</Review>< rate>

<Text>I had lunch with some of my colleagues last weekend here and the experience was great! They have the best tasting Wedge Salad, and it was very delicious! We enjoyed a glass of wine after lunch. The place is so welcoming and entertaining. Highly recommended restaurant in the city! Try them now and taste their delectable dishes.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>I have come here several times already and will continue doing so. The chicken is fried to a perfect crisp on the outside while being quite tender and moist on the inside. The brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes and honey biscuits went well with the chicken. The bread pudding was good and very sweet (for those who don't enjoy something too sweet, you may not enjoy this).</text><UserId.>103038453037846048163<//UserId.>< name>

This is easily one of the best local restaurants I have ever been to. The food is a great twist on authentic Filipino dishes. Their desserts are absolutely out of this world. Like you can literally order any of them and be happy. The staff is so friendly and treat you like you're part of the family. I try to visit at least once a week!</Review>

Good food, had the steak and fries and the garlic shrimp tapas. Portions are big enough to split. GREAT Sangria!!!  And the outdoor patio? Perfect for a date. Really pretty at night.<//review>

In short, the food is great if you like Filipino food with a twist. I recommend getting the fusion dishes and not the typical Filipino food. The service is very positive (it's a family business).
I went with my parents (both Filipino) for the first time. I ordered the adobo fries, my mom got the adobo bowl, and my dad got the MK combo. I was worried the adobo fries (carne asada fries but with chicken adobo instead) wouldn't work taste-wise but I was wrong. The adobo fries were delicious. My mom said her adobo bowl was okay and my dad said the food was good but not authentic Filipino. For dessert, we got the putoflan, ube cupcake, and a whole fruit pizza. The putoflan was very good, the ube cupcake was good, and the fruit pizza (with a cookie base) was very sweet (I liked it).<//review>

I was looking for Chinese food in the foothills with a full bar, and found Mestiza Kitchen.  They have great lunch specials which change daily, and are all outstanding!  Definitely try and make it over and give it try.  It is calm ambiance with super friendly staff, I usually will see someone that I know, which is always nice as well!</Review>

The combo plate had 2 sliders, 2 chicken skewers, noodles, and 4 lumpias (filipino egg rolls). Plenty of food for the 2 of us.

The ube cake was amazing! Not too sweet, but clear ube flavor and super moist.

Overall I strongly recommend checking this place out.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Wow, finally a authentic Philipino restaurant.  We all (family of four) decided on the MK Combo,  Pancit, chicken skewers, Adobe slider, and two lumpia. So so good. Good on you guys for bringing this to us.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp><pics>None< /pics>< user_name>

Tried out this place for the first time. It was mediocre. I’ve had better Filipino food. I ordered the adobo over rice and chicken skewer. The adobo had that usual sour taste from the vinegar but there was a weird, sweet taste, like sugar added to it. I can’t place it but it just didn’t work with the dish. I think they were going for the fusion but it just didn’t work for me. If it worked for others, that’s great! The chicken was ok, maybe a bit raw (on the inside). Maybe a few more minutes on the grill and it would’ve been a super awesome dish! The lady working may be the owner. She seemed very nice but very quiet. I’ll be back again to try some of the other dishes and desserts though!<//Review>

Had the MK combo. The adobo slider is unbelievably good. I could make a meal of those any time of day or night. Chicken skewer also excellent. Noodles and lumpia very good too. It's counter serve like Presto Pasta, order and they bring it to you. No soda fountain so it's the house juices or canned/bottled drinks. It's different and worth trying.</review>

I ask for Haley every time I make a visit to the salon.  For once, the colorist understood my concerns and personality, gave me the most fun and beautiful color I have ever had!  Sombre, was what Haley did for me and it turned out phenomenal.  It is easy to maintain.  No more getting frustrated about roots showing in a couple of weeks.  Best of all, it looks so much fun for the summer!  It shimmers in the sun and shows layers when the wind blows.  I love it!  Thanks Haley!  I'll see you again and have you think of something awesome for me :)< /review>

<text>I like the place but the lady changed the shape of my nails and shortened the length which I didn't want. I've been getting alot of complements those. I paid $27 for a gel polish fill that I requested ombre, but the lady said I could only get obmre color if I got a new set which would have been $10 more.< /text>< gmapID>

I told her I had an appointment with her for 2pm . She looks at me all Surprised and said your  appointment  was for yesterday. I said no !!! It’s for today . Then she says . Well your going to half to wait for 2 hrs until I can take you . I’m like I have a appointment with you now lady !!!!!!I never made a nail appointment . Where I have to wait for 2 1/2 hours . very disappointed , will never ever return to this establishment. Waste of time .........</Text>

This salon is full of talented amazing artists. You will get nothing but the best from every single one. Veronica has been doing my hair and she basically saved it from all the damage ( i did to it myself) and got it back to LIFEEEEE let me tell you no need to look anywhere else. if you want fabulous , amazing hair and non stop compliments this is the place to go. Great vibe in the salon and overall amazing experience !!< /review>

VIP is the absolute business.  Cathy, Re and the rest of the ladied are the most professional Nailologist in the business. Eyelashes, eyebrows and hair removal done by Cathy or Na Na can not be compared to any one from Los Angeles to Palm Springs!  You sell yourself short by not stopping by to checking them out!</text>

<Review>They rushed and majority of our nails look horrible. Didn't clean nails before putting new nails on so dirt is visible, white tips and not straight horrible service overall would not recommend for anyone. Sloppy and liars will never go here again.</Review>< pics>

The fig burger??!!!? SO GOOD. The charcoal lemonade is also fun; tastes like normal lemonade but it looks cool. But for real, the fig burger is to die for. Also, I believe the tip is calculated into your bill european style, so if it seems like your bill is wrong, it might be because they already charged you for a tip!<//Review>

<text>Sit inside or outside and seat yourself. Everything is open &  spaced out appropriately. You can QR Code the menu and place your order by phone or a server can also help you. Lots of great beers on tap as well as top shelf cocktail selections. I ordered the Eureka Burger with herbs to cheese and sweet potato fries. Medium rare was perfect. A mouthwatering ample patty with all the fixings. The sweet potato fries were fluffy and had a light drizzle of honey. Nothing fancy, casual and relaxed, comfortable with top notch service!</text>< Pics>

The fig jam plus goat cheese plus arugula was an excellent combo. My husband got the spicy chicken sandwich and fries mac and cheese balls, and he was unimpressed. It was good, but not special. The service was good except at the end when we had to wait a long time to pay. We had to snag a hostess to take out payment. But all the employees were very nice.< /review>< userid>

Eureka has the best Burgers in SB  amazing drink specials and a great atmosphere. I would normally give it 5 stars but at this point they are making you order online, even when you are sitting down at the restaurant. I was there last night with my buddy and having to order online was a distraction from our conversation. The food and staff were great so I hope they go away from the online ordering system soon.<//text>

Definitely a place I recommend to friends when they come and visit. The burgers are on point and the staff is very nice and has always provided great customer service. Their happy hour is also a great addition to what they have to offer.< /Review>

<Text>Burgers are delicious, but a bit pricey. I get the feeling this is a place based more upon their happy hour drink specials. They have MANY beers on tap and an expansive collection of spirits. Their happy hour lasts most of the night, except highest traffic times. Outdoor heated seating available.</Text>< user_id>

I recommend to try Osso Buco Riblets (sherry braised pork). My husband said the burger was good too.<//Text>

This is one of the first places we came to when we first got to Santa Barbara. It is top notch, even though you still have to eat outside, the food is great and service is friendly. Prices have gone up because of COVID and less customers, but it's well worth it.</text>

<review>Great unique burgers and a nice selection of craft beer. Great atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. In the downtown mall so it's near shopping and not far from the beach.< /review>< userid>

Good food. Cozy. Lively. Family. Single

Excellent place to unwind and dine.

Food choices are plentiful - something for everyone.

Fish tacos are healthy - every bite is a rainbow of flavors 🌈

Burgers - juicy delicious and filling

Beers - IPA's are excellent.<//text>

<Review>Located in the heart of downtown, this place has some good background music and an option to seat inside or outside by the street. The food was good, $$ price tag and ample variety of mocktails. Servants were welcoming and kind.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>No manager on duty.... aside from the terrible service, indifferent attitude, weak drinks, and dirty tables, the burger was good -ish. Dry, under seasoned a little over cooked. fries were cold and limp. Upon arriving we saw three dirty booths and our waiter, after we interrupted, said he clean the table, promptly left and didn’t return. A young lady then offers us a table next to a wide open window at 11pm and we again asked for a booth to be cleaned. Finally as someone cleaned one booth, a couple of 16year old privileged kids slide in and no one says a thing and three of us were still at a table with an open window. Finally we get a table and order drinks. The waitress returned 5 minutes later and took our order offering to leave us with drink menus. Another 5 minutes and we see our drinks at the bar sitting. Had to rouse the waitress who was engaged with her social life to bring us the drinks- which she did, sans apology.
The Manhattan was 1/2 a drink and when I questioned that... I was told the ice cube was small and that’s why the drink wasn’t even 1/2 a glass tall!
Overall it’s clear there are only a bunch of twenty somethings trying to run this place- and doing so pretty much like... a bunch of kids would- poorly!<//Text>< username>

Burgers are amazing and you really cannot go wrong with any of them. I really enjoyed the 28 day dry aged beef on the bed of greens.

They have a great selection of beers, local, and widespread. They also have a lot of great whisky's. I did a flight to broaden my whisky knowledge, and they all were pretty good!

I highly recommend this place as the service is always great, prices are fair, and they have some specials on beers and brunches on weekends. Check them out!</review>< username>

<text>This is a great family friendly restaurant with full bar.,Their meals are very unique including our favorites the mac and cheese bites, and of course the truffle Fries!  On the weekend they serve a good brunch with $5 bloody Marys or mimosas. Parking is easy down below in the shopping center, definitely a place you want to visit!</text><userid>115140718082754420630<//userid>< response>

< Review>
Love the "hoppy hour" here. 2-6pm and 9pm-close every day is tough to beat. Beyond that, the food is very tasty (especially the brussels sprouts) , and they always have solid service. Prices are in the moderate range, the beer selection is quite good, and the burgers are on point. It is a kind of upscale sports bar though, so it can get kind of loud and there are TVs all over the restaurant. They do have outside seating and they allow dogs on the patio.< /Review>

Looked dark inside, and was very empty at 5pm on a Tuesday, but excellent food and very attentive service. Happy (or rather, hoppy) hour runs till 6pm so drinks and appetizers were all a little cheaper. Love that naked (bun-free) burgers are listed as an option.< /review>

My burger was practically charcoal and I told the server who told her manager. I just wanted to let them know, maybe give a heads up to the kitchen, I had no expectation of compensation. And yet the manager comped the burger. That more than anything else makes me willing to give this place another chance. It seems if people were constantly complaining, the manager wouldn't be so free with the compensation.
Also, the fries were excellent and all the produce for the burger was fresh and delicious.
Will try again.</text>

I come on a regular basis, and the food has always been excellent. The vibe is always good with the music selection, and they always have the sports games on at the bar.< /review>

All the burgers are very tasty. Love their "hoppy hour" too - a pretty decent selection of appetizers, plus $2 off their regular beers, including the Golden Monkey Tripel.< /text>

<Text>Absolutely love the “Eureka!” In San Luis Obispo but this one did NOT deliver. 3 stars due to great, prompt service, but if that wasn’t included, it might as well be a 1.5-2 stars. Both burgers tasted terrible and were BURNED when we asked for medium. Also the sauce wasn’t on the burger (we usually love this specific burger) and the toppings were charred. It might as well have been a charcoal burger... maybe it was a bad day for them, but it happened to be when we arrived...<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

This was an excellent experience.  I had the American burger that was dripping with juice and yummy toppings.  Our waiter Erin cheerfully took all my husband's requests and variations like he knew and understood him.  Sat outside with heaters or umbrellas, whatever we needed.  My husband loved his chile and fish tacos.  It all lived up to the high bar of Santa Barbara eateries.< /Review>

Love this place. I order here all the time. I have some strict dietary restrictions so I love that they have a vegan option and can make the curries with coconut milk instead!!!! They have a good portions for take out (the biggest I've seen in my studio city area).<//Review>

Got no service for about 15 minutes after being seated had to go find a server and let them know; Afterwards, service was good. Food is a bit pricey for quality vs quantity; Therefore overpriced.  Overall a mediocre restaurant/bar.< /Review>

Eurekas food and manager Sid are both fabulous.  I ordered through Grub Hub lastnight and two items were missing.  The food we received was cooked to order and amazing.  Grub Hub never went back for missed items even after promising to. Sid at Eureka even offered to deliver it himself which speaks volumes for his care for the restaurant and his customers.  We love Eurekas food and will definitely be dining with them again.  A BIG SHOUT OUT TO SID FOR GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!<//text>

I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed this chain restaurant. It’s hard to find good chains sometimes. There are obviously some items that are a miss but mostly it’s pretty good.<//review>

The food is great. I like the cowboy burger and the truffle sauce for the fries. But you can't beat their $3 Hoppy Poppy Pints!</Review>

<text>I'm from out of my town.  This is my first time there.  I had the ribletts and the blackend fish tacos. The blackend fish tacos were really good.  They were stuffed with a lot of fish.  They waiters are very knowledgeable about the menu and the ingredients.  I'm severe dairy allergy and the waiter worked with me.< /text>< Time>

Good place but not consistent. Food is reliably good but the service seems to vary. Hope they notch up the service consistency so they can get a four star rating. Great burgers, falafel appetizer, and chicken nachos.< /text>

I've been to Santa Barbara twice and both times have come here for a meal. Service has always been friendly, the food very good, prompt, and priced fairly. The Marrow Burger is great- I was a bit worried about the horseradish aioli, but it's not too spicy. The fries could be a little bit crisper, but overall good. The ranch and ketchup are made in house I think and both very good. Beer selection is on point.< /Review>

Hostess wouldn't make eye contact to help us. No one stopped by after we received our food to see if everything was okay. Our order was missing an item and our drinks were empty and never refilled. Felt like we were held hostage waiting for someone to come by to give us our check so we had to go up and request our check. Initially they were busy but towards the end of our meal there was plenty of open tables. No excuse for this type of service. This shouldn't be that difficult. Food was good otherwise.</text>

I have a hard time deciding if it's worth the extra money or you're better off paying half and going to the habit.  More creative and gourmet options but pretty pricey for a burger.  They have lots of good whiskey</review>

<review>Worst service. 9 waiters in service for maybe 10 guests and they didn’t manage to do anything else than standing around and talk to each other.

Ordered a double burger and a single patty burger came. We waited another 20min. until they managed to bring the second patty.

Can’t recommend at all.< /review>< user_id>

<name>Pamela Papillon< /name><Text>They specialize in burgers, and the quality of the meat, along with the creative preparations (for example, the jalapeno egg burger, which was great) cement their place as the best burger place in town. But they don't stop at burgers. The varied menu includes chicken, vegetable dishes, even a falafel appetizer that will make you want to order seconds. Top it off with a huge variety of craft beers, a fun and comfortable ambience, outdoor seating (still somewhat unusual in Santa Barbara), and excellent service, and you have my new favorite restaurant.<//Text>< rate>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I have been here at least once a month since they opened. You cannot beat the $3 Hoppy Poppy happy hour prices ($4 for non happy hour, still great!) anywhere else in town. The beat burgers are amazing. Unfortunately, the buns are not vegan (come on Eureka!) so vegans will need to replace the bun with an arugula salad (it's pretty good, but sometimes you just want a real burger). The protein salad is delicious and cheap. The happy hour is every day before 6pm and after 9pm. They sometimes have Brussels sprouts with a balasic glaze which are amazing. The staff is generally very friendly but it seems like there is a lot of turn over in the staff. Anyway, if you're a cool person, go here. Great beer, good prices, great location.</Text>< userid>

<review>Went in for lunch yesterday, I should have known own from the start it was going to be a bad experience. Asked for a glass of water and noticed it had floating particles and food stuck to the inside of the glass. I didn't make a big deal out of it, I simply asked for a different cup and was brought another dirty cup. After our food was delivered our waiter disappeared. Literally no where to be found. No other waiter came by to ask if I needed anything. I never got a refill on my drink or got to order an adult beverage I wanted. I had to flag down another waiter to bring my check and then flag another for them to pick up the check. Such a disappointment because the food was amazing but the service was so bad.<//review></record>

The place is really nice: post-industrial style. The service is impeccable, the staff is truly cool and friendly. And the food is excellent!< /review>

<Review>This place has a good atmosphere, interest menu, and beer good burgers. I enjoyed their cowboy burger with some amazingly fresh coleslaw on the side that worked perfectly together. The burger was perfectly cooked to order, had fresh ingredients and tasted  amazing.

My wife ordered the chicken sandwich with their honey cinnamon sweet potato fries. She loved the sandwich. The fries were your typical sweet potato fries, but just tasted like they'd be lightly drizzled with honey. Nothing special, but not bad.

I would certainly recommend the place, along with getting there early, as the wait can get somewhat long.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

It wasn't busy to use as an excuse on lack of attention, waiters and waitresses were hanging around the computers talking and laughing.

One of my favorite spots in SB. Whether you want to stop by for a quick drink, or sit down and enjoy a meal, it's a great place for either. They always have a great selection of beers on tap that change. So, there's a good chance you'll be able to try something new every time you visit. If you're not a beer person, don't worry, they have a full bar and wine. You will also not be disappointed in the food. Their specialty is burgers, and all of them are delicious. However, they also have a great starters selection. I recommend the mussels. I've never had mussels with pancetta and jalapeños before. Made for a great combination.</Text>

<Text>Great food, but it's a hit or miss on whether you're going to get good service or bad service. If you're looking for a good burger, definitely don't turn your nose up at it, but be warned that their service varies.< /Text><userid>115088258599010017565</userid>< username>

There's a lot of variety in sides, burgers, beers, and whiskeys. Plenty to keep coming back and trying something completely new!

The place can get pretty crowded/loud, so plan accordingly! It's worth the wait!</text>< Date>

I do not write reviews often, but this place took me back. The food was fenominal, hands down the best Bison burger Inhave ever had. The staff, atmosphere, and all around vibe of this restaraunt are top notch. I will go out of my way to make sure I can come back again. Fantastic!</Review>

<Text>If I could give this place 4.5 stars, I would. The beer selection is phenomenal and there is one thing on the menu that I HAVE to order on the menu every time --- tempura friend green beans. I was skeptical my first time, but I am SO glad I got them because now I get them every time. The mac and cheese appetizer is also delicious and they can add crispy bacon and sage in there which makes it even better. The burgers are also delicious -- I get turkey and it is super juicy for turkey! I could go on and on, but I will stop myself now! Go check out Eureka!<//Text>< pics>

My wife, 17 month old and I were served by Joel. My wife and child were exhausted from a day downtown and I had just gotten off of work. I felt like Joel sought us out the perfect amount of times to check on us throughout our experience. Never did I feel like he was invasive or unavailable. My daughter started fussing with the crayons and children's menu, so Joel brought her avocados and watermelon. He didn't realize that avocados are her favorite. He was patient with the change in our orders, and was available whenever we asked for something else. Totally looking forward to our next visit here, and hoping to get someone with as much focus on customer service.<//text>

Usually i have a great experience here..it could have been just a bad night..never the less tonight's experience may be my last..the place was full of drunks crowding the door and knocking people around, despite the mild crowding our server was very sweet, unfortunately the wait for service was rough. We had to actually request salt and it took them 15 minutes and us asking 3 different servers for us to get one cup ranch dressing. However, the main issue I have overall is when me and my Pregnant fiancé asked for a cowboy burger and bison burger medium rare and took one bite and tasted something off. We decided to go straight  home after that taking the burgers home were my fiancé and i both threw up. Upon inspection of the burgers we saw that they were both not medium rare but raw.<//text>

<review>This place is awesome. Great beer list, and they have a local beer for just $3. But the burgers are the real attraction, my girlfriend loved the veggie patty and the catalina bison burger was incredible. Great fries and huge onion rings. See also Brewco in Manhattan Beach.<//review>< pics>

The best burgers in town, craft beers and booze in a college/beach town atmosphere. Always reasonably crowded with beautiful younger people.<//Text>

<Text>Food can be nice here and there are  reasons to go here. But the service is definitely  a step below. I think they get so many people there is a certain amount of cool and aloofness associated with "tourists" and the problem I have is they reminded me of it by the lack of warmth. I won't return to this place if I am in the neighborhood even if the food is ok to many other great choices.<//Text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Good, customary food. The service is very nice and attentive. When my friend's coke was half empty, he - just like that - refilled it again & said that you should still have enough to drink when you eat. I've never seen a gesture like this - really great!
The food was also very tasty :)

(Original)
Gutes, landesübliche Essen. Die Bedienung ist sehr nett & aufmerksam. Als die Coke von meiner Freundin halb leer war, hat er diese - einfach so - nochmal aufgefüllt & meinte, dass du beim Essen noch genügend zu trinken haben sollst. So eine Geste habe ich noch nie erlebt - wirklich toll!
Das Essen war nebenbei auch sehr lecker :)< /review>
