First I ordered food from GrubHub however they never showed up. I called and they informed me after a certain time they do not make the meal I ordered. Wow this is after an hour wait. I ordered another meal and waited. I was only five minutes away. After 45 min I called and was told the driver came up to door knocking and nobody answered. That is not true. There is a gate so he could not get in and I was next to the door waiting. Finally owner delivered the food and it was excellent however I will never order food from them again< /text>

< Review>
Took 3 hours to get my food. I ordered on grubhub and called the restaurant when my food wasn't delivered at the time it said it would. The guy who answered lied and said it left already and would be here in 10 minutes. It took another 2 hours for it to be delivered. Which the incompetent driver couldn't use his GPS I had to drive and meet him somewhere to get my food. If I wanted to drive to get my food I wouldn't have ordered from grubhub. The food was poorly packaged and was not even good. Will never go here again and will recommend everyone stay away from this business.<//Review>

<Review>1 Large extra cheese pizza and garlic bread came to $25; seemed steep but we thought the pizza would be good.
The pizza was small and looks / tastes like Pizza Hut. Was charged $3.50 for extra cheese and it looked like a normal amount.
$3.50 for delivery charge (plus our $5 tip) and it still took an hour to get to us.

Other pizza places around this area have better pizza at a much lower price.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
Delicious food, a very friendly and warm staff, I eat here weekly, and they are primarily responsible for my weight gain of some 40 lbs in the last year.  I'd give them two thumbs up but I'm too busy tonight eating my delicious veggie lasagna garlic bread and crisp garden salad salad with both hands. All they need to add to be perfect is a liquor license and some Chianti<//Review>

Im leaving the area so I wanted to leave this they've always been courteous and welcome customer service they've never gotten my order wrong and the delivery driver always keeps me posted if he's running late or not. Not many places deliver on the Naval Base, but Im glad this place does please give it a try.</Text>

<review>The delivery service is very slow, they probably need to hire more drivers. However I ordered right after a Chargers game ended so that was most likely the reason for the delay. The driver apologized for being late and was nice enough. The food was actually pretty good for a mom and pop restaurant. I would say eat at the location rather than delivery definately. They have good sandwiches but the pizza is similar to Little Caesar's....<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80d9535f5650c447:0xe6f9786afeac17b9<//GmapID></record>

In 2016 to pass along a credit card service and still have overpriced food, really!?  Your drive is lucky she got a tip.  Furthermore, if I had noticed the service I would have sent her back without taking the food or paying.  Get with the program and you might have a decent establishment.  Piss poor management.<//Text>

1st time: food arrived 30 minutes after GrubHub estimated (1.5hrs total).  2nd time: food never showed.  I called them after 2.5hrs had passed, and the manager told me the food had been delivered.  I had been home all along, only a few feet from my door.  There was never a knock or a call.

I don't know how they are still in business.<//text>

Should have checked reviews before ordering via UberEATS. Terrible customer service, cancelled order after 45 MINUTES OF WAITING. I called the store and they were rude and unhelpful, told me to call Uber, which I already had. After that, they told me I must have the wrong number.

Incredibly rude and incompetent staff, skip this place, you will be far better off ordering from dominos or even making a frozen pizza. Seriously anything is better than this place.<//review>

<Review>Ordered a lasagna and an Italian sub. One of the places that delivers to Naval Base San Diego. Figured I would give it a shot. What can I say really the lasagna tasted like fish.. there is no other way to describe it. Lasagna should never taste even remotely of fish. On to the sub it had more mayo on it than actual meat or vegetables.

Would not eat here again and if you're ordering from base stick with brew house or romas.< /Review>< Pictures>

Ordered based on hotel recommendation.The online menu is outdated. I was told items I ordered were no longer available and the person that took my order wasn't very nice about it. They took 45 minutes to deliver and the pizza was cold when I finally got it. Whoever said it was like little Caesars is not giving Caesars enough credit. Disappointed and don't recommend it.<//Text>

<Text>My visit to this dentist office was great. Dr.Peritore and staff made me very comfortable and explained everything that was going to be done. I had a root canal and I now refer to the Dr. as Dr Painless. I would definitely recommend this office to my friends. Thanks for taking the FEAR out of going to the dentist.<//Text></record>

Terrific customer service from the first call. Front end staff professional and friendly. Offices clean and comfortable.  But the best part. Dr. M and his assistant were so kind and comforting; explained everything thoroughly and made me feel like I had been a patient of theirs for years and not my first time. If you must get a root canal this is the place to go!< /text>

I had a great experience during my first visit for a root canal. Dr Michaelian was super nice and very easy to talk to. And I apologize but I forgot the dental hygenists name but she has blonde hair and she was just the sweetest ever. I was also happy because the first numbing injections didn’t fully numb me and they made sure to get me more. I get so scared of feeling anything at the dentist. But i felt nothing! So thank you to the whole team! The receptionist Wendy was also amazing :)< /Review>

Ok I’ll be the first to admit I HATE dentist and I usually have some sort of panic attack during my visit. However, my experience here was quite different. The front staff is friendly and welcoming (even though I had attitude...sorry again). Dr. Kory preformed a root canal and was very gentle yet thorough when cleaning out any infection. His assistant did an excellent job ensuring that I was comfortable and calm throughout my visit.< /review>

Dr. M is a true professional that understands those of us that fear dental pain. He is gentle, listens carefully, observant and is amazing in his field. I did not experience any pain during the procedure! Afterwards, his assistant Cathy fully explained what Dr. M did and later he himself came in to show me some of the tools he used. Having a root canal sounded extremely painful and long! It only took him about an hour and there was NO pain! Great place, great doctor. I recommend completely!< /Text>

Office is so very professional kind and caring. Dr. Kory took his time to make sure that I was completely numb before starting the procedure. Jennie, his assistant was very helpful and comforting. Wendy's at the front desk was also very helpful present.
I would highly recommend anyone needing a root canal to go here<//Review>

Today on May 25/21, I arrived at the clinic with terrible pain, with a swollen face due to an infection in the tooth.
The front desk assistant greeted us very warmly, (she looks like a Kelly Rowland) and the doctor's assistant were very communicative.
Dr. Radhika Tandon is a professional in her field, she was able to save my tooth instead of removing it, for which I am very grateful to her. Feel myself wonderful. Thank you🌹</review>

Let me start off by saying that Dr. Michaelian is absolutely fantastic!
I went and saw many different dental professionals in regards to my missing teeth that were pulled about 10 years ago, and nobody was able to help me. I just continued to get referred out to other specialists. Those of whom all made the idea of dental implants seem like an impossible task to perform, due to bone loss after too many years passing since the teeth were extracted. But when I came to see Dr. Michaelian there was no hesitation. He is very confident in what he does. As he should be, because he is extremely good at what he does. I was impressed. It was so quick for something that everyone else made seem like such a hassle. He is SO amazing in this profession!
Everybody else in the office makes you feel so comfortable also. Sort of long time friends or family kind of feel. They're all so nice, professional, and very clean/sanitary in all that they do. Best Dental experience (Dr., Assistant, and staff) by far!
I just got my new teeth and I am so happy to be able to eat again! And they look so beautiful. No more black holes for almonds, and pretzels to get wedged down in.
What a great experience! I am truly thankful, and couldn't be happier, Dr. Michaelian and his staff are all amazing! Thank you all! 🤗< /Text>

Dr. Michaelian has helped me many times with everything from a root canal to implants. I have a hard time with dentists because I have a lot of pain when I have to hold my mouth open for any length of time, so Dr. Michaelian also offers different types of sedation... thank goodness. He is kind and really listens to you. I highly recommend him to anyone that wants quality service and/or needs a little extra help being comfortable.</Text>

Saw Dr. Corey. I explained when he first met me, I had a lot of anxiety and do not do well with getting numbing medications. I told him he would need to go slow and gentle. I knew from past experiences that the epinephrine makes my heart race and I have uncontrollable shakiness. He proceeded to numb me and it was the most painful experience, fearful and traumatic. I was in tears under those glasses. I finally insisted and told him I needed 5 minutes to relax and let the numbing medication get to work. He came back and proceeded to drill into my crown and clean out the infection in my tooth. He explained what treatment he performed and gave me the treatment options for my tooth. I shouldn't have been so uncomfortable, his bedside manner wasn't great  Definitely not going back to see him due to my experience with Dr. Corey.<//Text>

Came here for my first root canal and needless to say I was having some anxiety for the procedure.  The doctors and assistant had a very calm and easy going demeanor and walked me through the process, which made things more relaxing for me.  The RC itself was 100% painless and quick (about 45min).  Definitely recommend them! Thanks</text>

<Review>This is the best dental experience I’ve ever had!
From the way my tooth was numbed to the end.
It was a totally comfortable experience!
I wish they were my regular dentist!
These guys are the best!<//Review>< rate>

I booked same day appointment for root canal treatment. I was welcomed by very friendy stuff and saw doctor couple minutes after.  Procedure was quick, painless and successful. On my way home, I completely forgot that I just had root canal treatment.

Will I come back? Hopefully not, but in case I need it I definitely will!
Will I recommend to the others? I just did :)

Thank you very much for helping me today!< /text>

I had to get a root canal done and my experience with Dr Tandon and her staff was outstanding. The office was clean and everyone was professional. A root canal had me feeling anxious and I put a lot of trust and faith on Dr Tandon and she made sure that I was comfortable. She explained the procedure every step of the way and was thorough. I would recommend Dr Tandon if you ever need a root canal done.<//Review>

As always when I have to visit a dentist, I become very anxious as some of my previous dental experiences were not good at all! But the staff at Bay Area Endodontists were friendly and courteous and Doctor Peritore's explanation for my forthcoming procedures put me at ease, all my questions and concerns were answered and I look forward to having my 2 root canals done there as I know I will be in very good hands! Very clean and professional looking office too! I am glad I have to go back there (San Mateo) for my treatments! Thanks again guys!!
UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW 06/03/21
I have since had both my root canal filings done and Stephanie, Mona and Dr Peritore made me feel at ease and were such good sports! Made my fear and anxiety about going to dentists in general go away! They are the best and I hope to see them again soon! I will highly recommend them to anyone looking to have root canals done by a good and courteous, professional team! Thanks again guys!!< /text>

I was referred to Bay Area Endodontics because I was in need of a root canal on tooth#3 and the dentist I saw felt that I needed to be referred to a Specialist to have the procedure done because it was not going to be an easy RCT.  I referred to another practice first but found out after I spoke with them that they were not in my insurance network.  My dentist office called me back and advised that I can go to Bay Area Endodontics.  I first want to say that I had never had a root canal before so the only thing I knew about them is what I had heard from other people who had one done and I heard nothing but horror stories.  I was a little hesitant when I called in to schedule my appointment because I cannot handle tooth pain AT ALL.  I called in and originally scheduled my appointment for 6/1 in their San Mateo location.  I had asked if they had an opening sooner if they could let me know.  Well literally 10 minutes after I scheduled for 6/1, I received a call that they just had a cancellation so I could come in the very same day later on at 12:45pm.  It was 9am when I was on the phone with them.  They emailed me the paperwork I needed to fill out, called me before my appointment to let me know how much my out of pocket amount would be.  They also advised that if I needed to make payment arrangements I would be able to talk to them about it when I came in.  Now on to the BEST part of this review....I arrived right at 1pm and was called back within 10 minutes of me arriving.  They took X-rays and explained everything they were doing IN DETAIL and the lovely part of this was the fact that I DID NOT FEEL ANY PAIN AT ALL.  I heard the drilling and whatever else was going on but I didn't feel a single thing.  It was AMAZING.  In addition to not feeling a single thing, I was back home by 2:25pm.   The numbness was gone by 4pm and I did not need to take Tylenol or Ibuprophen because I didn't feel any pain at all.  I  just want to THANK everyone at Bay Area Endodontics for being AWESOME!  I will be referring anyone I know who is in need of a root canal to them.  They were  absolutely WONDERFUL!  From the scheduler, to the girl at the front desk to the actual Endodontist and the Hygenist Nancy.  I believe she is a Hygenist but not sure.  Anyways, they are absolutely AMAZING!!!  If I could give them 10 stars I would.<//review>

First time getting a root canal worked on. Not gonna lie, I was super nervous before my appointment but Dr. Tandon and her assistant Nancy made the whole process so easy and calming. Dr. Tandon’s hands are so delicate. The procedure went by smoothly, and I’m no longer afraid to get a root canal anymore. Hopefully this one will be my only and last one! I would give them more than 5 stars! ⭐️< /Review>

Dr. Tandon took time to explain to me the condition of my tooth, how it is different, and the procedure. The entire procedure was painless and the pain that was bothering me for 3 days (started during the weekend when everything was close) was now manageable without pain medication.</Text>< time>

Very comfortable in the environment.  The doctor explained what they were seeing on the Scans which I appreciated.  I stopped the procedure after novocaine was applied due to claustrophobia when seeing the dental dam they had to use with the root canal.  In the past, I had never seen this used in a root canal.  My old style dentist did everything, he was in Fremont.  I should have been shown what was going to happen during the procedure before the anesthesia was applied. Recommendation now is to be put to sleep during the procedure.  New appointment farther away and requiring someone to drive me.  Brought CD with prior scans but they were unable to read them (?).  New scans at no cost, which was also appreciated.< /Text>

The Doctor and the support staff where great; I appreciate all the professionalism.and all the work done. The front desk person was rude and disrespectful. He even added more info to my bill after I signed instead of putting it up front and letting me agree then sign. I’m sure there are clients that give trouble with paying. I just would rather be given the benefit of this thought he shared and not feel attacked by his words and lack of professionalism. Again the Doctor and others did a fantastic job.< /Text>

Dr Michelin is great for doing root canals. I did not feel any pain at all after the root canal treatment was done and hence no medication was needed. I also happened to do wisdom tooth extraction at this place i would not recommend doing tooth extractions here at all.< /Review>

<Review>I have received two root canals and both times they were not done properly. Then after the third root canal.  He wanted to charge me 1000 for the same root canal.  After I explained to him. This is is goin to be the third time. And why do I have to pay again after you did both my root canal after both they were not done right. I am not happy with the customer service. The receptionist called me and was very rude and told me I had to pay upfront because I canceled because I didn’t have the money to pay the thousand dollars.</Review>< rate>

The office staff and clinicians were friendly and competent. The endodontist was calm and thorough. It did give me the heebies to be in the room with the CT machine while other people were getting scanned. I don’t know if the machine leaks radiation, but it was concerning.
They recommended 600 mg of NSAIDs every few hours from the time I had my root canal  to going back to the dentist. That was seven days. I was painfully constipated by the end of day 1 and stopped taking medication. There should be a warning given about that.

On the whole, they were competent and professional and I would recommend them.< /review>

I went for a repeat root canal with Dr. MJ. The entire process took about an hour, went super smooth. He clearly is master at this! I also loved the conversations I had with the assistants, it made me feel very welcome. Definitely recommend it !<//Text>

This was my second root canal with Dr. Peritore. He’s really professional, patient and kind. My English listening skill isn’t good. He tried to explain the process easily and told me again and again. He really took care of me asking frequently during the treatment if I was ok. I was so comfortable and even sleepy.
He also checked out my teeth that got root canal last year even though I didn’t ask to check it. I really appreciate him and the staff.</Text>< time>

<Date>1610556772634<//Date><rate>5< /rate><Text>I take great care of my teeth...but I unfortunately required a visit due to escalating pain. My experience with Dr Tandon in the Los Gatos office was excellent!  From the first phone call (getting in earlier than scheduled by dentist) to exiting after procedure was professional and friendly. (Push hard, the door sticks going in/out!)

I was quickly scanned and the Dr listened to a full account of my symptoms.  She took great care to validate I did indeed need a full root canal. She was patient to answer all of my questions, and explained the process in detail before she did anything.

I felt SO much better so quickly!  Oral surgery was all new to me...and I found it actually easier to tolerate than having a regular filling done at my dentist. I really appreciate the prompt, kind, professionalism of the entire office staff.  Dr Tandon is experienced, informative, and sympathetic. I highly recommend her, and her assistant!< /Text>< Pictures>

Prompt professional care. The doctor saved me hundreds of dollars by re-diagnosing my supposed root canal, and told me it was not necessary. Apparently the dentist that sent me had not gotten the block in the correct spot during her assessment. Thank you so much Doc!< /review>

<Review>TL;DR: Dr. Tandon is great. She explains her approach and her treatment plan in detail while keeping it simple and makes sure I'm completely comfortable. I went in for a root canal I felt involved in my treatment, and had complete confidence that I was getting the best care. Thanks Dr. Tandon!

I went to see Dr. Tandon after having issues a few months after getting a root canal elsewhere.

Dr. Tandon explained that I should consider reaching out to the endodontist who performed the treatment, since I would likely get retreatment for free. Since I wasn't happy with the outcome of my last treatment and she was very thorough and thoughtful, I decided to do the treatment with her.

I've since had no issues, and I'm glad to have been her patient.< /Review>< rate>

<Text>I reccomend Bay Area Endodontics. I recently had a root canal and the procedure went smooth as butter.  Bay Area  Endodontics kept my Dentist in the loop as I need crown work done by  my Dentist after another root canal.

The Sunnvale Office had 3D imaging equipment that was able map a 3D image of my mouth.  I could see exactly what was happening to each tooth as far as cavities, bone loss, receeding gums, etc.  I felt super comfortable that my Doc could see exactly what treatment was required from the 3D images.

Bay Area Endodontics was able to accommodate me on short notice since the root canal needs to be completed prior to the crown work.

Bay Area Endodontics is on top of their game, I reccomend the Sunnyvale office because that's where I went.<//Text><response>{'time': 1611964603052, 'text': 'Thank you very much for your positive feedback.

<Text>My name is Jennifer is I am a dental assistant in which I have lots of experience with root canals. However, it was my turn to sit on the chair and have the root canal procedure done on tooth #8. This is my front upper tooth. I was so nervous because I have only ever been numbed with local anesthesia on my lower morals and upper molars. Thank God, I was cared for by one of the sweetest dental assistants at Bay Area Endodontics, her name is Mona! She was so caring and mindful of my little anxiousness and extended her grace to me by holding my hand during the shot. Now, if there’s a great assistant there is a great Dr. Dr. Michaelian (MJ) is so pleasing humorous and very precise in his explanations about his findings on the 3D-CT Scan and explained what needed to be done and the pros and cons of the specific Endo treatment! His technique with the loca anesthetic i je toons was so smooth that i felt foolish for having had made him load up on the numbing gel prior to the injection. In all, from start to begin, now looking back at my time in the chair as a patient, I had a blast! Mona and MJ work so well together it was almost like synchronized flow! The Root canal was painless and It felt great to experience the service that we as dental assistants always aim to give ! Can’t wait for my next root canals !< /Text><resp>{'time': 1611959989750, 'text': 'Thank you very much for your positive feedback. We are overjoyed to hear you experienced great care with us.

would mos def reccomend this place HANDS DOWN. nothing but ALL positive things to say about this practice. 2 things that stuck out to me was the customer service/professionalism and the welcoming/friendly environment. let's not forget WORK done there though. Dr Victor was very knowledgeable. explained what he was going to do AND on top of that, during the procedure, went easy on me. i felt very LITTLE to no pain. the work he did, i couldnt be any more pleased. oh n Ms Nancy the assistant, a job well done too. anybody i came in contact with, the receptionist n whoever there, all pleasant to interact with. the staff there...one of THE best i've ever dealt with.

Bay Area Endodontics DC (BA Endo DC) * hope that catches on =)
if i ever need work done...i will mos def RUN back to u guys.
THANKS AGAIN!!!<//Text>

I was dealing with AGONIZING pain for a week before coming in for a root canal. I chose this place based on the reviews and, LET ME TELL YOU, I was not disappointed whatsoever! Dr. Peritore made the whole experience so easy. He was very calming and checked on me to ask how I was doing throughout the entire procedure. He made me feel very relaxed (which is very hard for me to do during any type of dental work). Also, I barely felt anything during the numbing injections!! And I’m a giant baby when it comes to that. Dr. Peritore absolutely knows what he’s doing and I would recommend him to anyone in need of a root canal! I was a nervous wreck going in and came out with completely alleviated pain. Thank you Dr. Peritore and Bay Area Endodontics!!</Text>

Did a great job. This was my first root canal. Dr. Perotori asked frequently during the procedure if I was having any pain, and injected more anesthetic as needed, so it was very comfortable. He also took the time to explain everything well.</Review>

<Text>I went through over 1year @ western dental trying to get my root canal done,and all they did was waist my time and didn't do anything for me. Then I was referred to another dental office called gental dental and for another 6 months with them nothing was done
due to my high blood pressure, but yet they're supposed to be specialist that knows what to do with people that have  high blood pressure. so after all that I picked Bay Area Endodontics and for me it was God sent Dr Tandon is great. she knows what she's doing she's very considerate to her patients and she got my root canal done she's a very brave woman she's like let's do this . thank you so much.

Very professional and efficient work. No pain, no problems afterwards. I appreciated seeing xrays at every stage of the work. They got me in and fixed up with an emergency root canal on the same day I called in.
Great response with lots of compassion for the emergency. Thanks for taking my dental insurance!!< /text>

I had a root canal with Dr. Tandon.  She discussed a few options before starting, which I appreciated.  She was very reassuring and made sure I was very comfortable during the whole procedure.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Tandon.  The office was great to work with also!< /Text>

I was in excruciating pain with a gum infection at the base of a tooth that was causing a previous root canal to fail or something like that. It hurt. A lot. Dr. Peritore saw me on short notice and by the time he was done I had so little pain that I didn't even need to take pain medicine anymore.< /Review>

<review>Recently moved to the Bay area and was referred to Dr Michaelian for a root canal.  Office staff was great.  The procedure was quick and painless after the numbing of course. Would definitely recommend him.< /review></record>

O my god the best Endodontics  ever they was very friendly, clean and took time to explain my procedure  to me over and over until I understood exactly what they were going to do. The aftermath of my root canal on my front tooth at the top no pain after the numbness went away didn’t have to take any meds for swelling nor pain it feels like nothing ever happened. I would give him a TEN and wood recommend this Dentist to any and everyone.< /review>

<name>Irene Ortiz</name><Review>I had the best experience getting  a root canal. It was actually pain free. The staff is very professional and friendly. The doctor’s assistant made sure I was comfortable. Dr. Radhika Tandon took time to experience each procedure and make I had no pain or discomfort. They deserve 10 stars in my book. I recommend this good who is looking for an Endodontics. Thank you so much.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>Zen Fu< /user_name><date>1573854476096< /date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>I think Dr. Michaelian is very unprofessional. Here was my experience: My dentist referred me to get some teeth checked. After several X-ray were taken, Dr. Michaelian started working on one tooth. I asked if the tooth could be saved. He said yes. After he finished, three more X-ray were taken for this tooth. He informed me that the tooth could not be saved. It had to be pulled-out. I knew the condition of that tooth so I was not totally surprised. But what happened afterwards were very unpleasant
--I said I would like choose denture, not implant or bridge. He said several times that I had to do either implant or bridge. He was so sure that I had to ask my insurance later whether denture was an option. My insurance confirmed to me that I could choose denture.
--Then he left and asked the assistant to finish up. After everything’s done, the assistant wanted to take another Xray. Even such radiation is small, it is still risk to patient. I asked why, she said it was just the procedure. I told her I already took 5 xrays today for this tooth, and since it’s going to be pull out by my general dentist, I was not going to do another xray here. She went to tell Dr. Michaelian. Dr. Michaelian stormed in and said “you have to take that xray”! I asked why, he said it was to show his finished work so he could send everything to my general dentist. I said my general dentist could take xray for her procedure, but I was not going to take another xray here today. He yelled: “you are LEGALLY required to take this xray!” LEGALLY? What a scare technique! I said you could not force me to take a xray and hurried out of the chair. I thought if I stayed in that chair, he may physically force me to take it. He then said something that it may put his profession in risk. I told him that I could sign a form saying that I voluntarily declined to take that xray.
--then I asked about the second tooth that was he was supposed to evaluate, which I never had the chance to ask questions. I said “my dentist said that tooth was fragile and may not be able to experience a root canal. What do you think?” He said: “if you did not trust me, then go to find someone else.” I hope he would not charge my insurance for this evaluation since he did not provide.
A good doctor should care about patient instead of just himself; a good doctor should not TRY to scare the patient but to be patient. This is definitely not my experience with Dr. Michaelian
The one star is for the assistant and the receptionist. They were quite nice<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I needed a root canal on a tooth that couldn't be numbed, at least by conventional methods, and Bay Area Endodontics offered IV sedation, which I what I wanted. I am not kidding, it felt like I had just closed my eyes, when I felt them taking the "stuff" out of my mouth and raising the chair. No pain (not even sensation) and no memory of the procedure itself. I went back to my dentist for the crown, the the tooth has been perfect ever since. Dr. Michaelian did a splendid job on the root canal, and made me comfortable doing it. IV sedation IS expensive, but if you have a tooth that can't be numbed, or are just to anxiety ridden about getting a root canal, see Dr. Michaelian at Bay Area Endodontics.<//Text><userid>118122732224439075186<//userid>< Time>

They added a 7% service fee to my bill. I didn't see that posted anywhere. I saw that on my receipt that I had to request from the cashier. I probably won't be back.</Text>< pictures>

The food was great with the service to match. I do prefer a bit more snap in my hot dogs but this is about as close to home as I can get. I also had the curly fries which were awesome! Nice and thick cut. Great stuff!<//Text>

<text>So this place is supposed to be based off Chicago style offerings and the menu looks delightful as far as Chicago food staples. I love Chicago and the food there is amazing but one of my all time favorites is the Italian beef sandwich.

I ordered the "Hella Big Beef" and when it came out, it resembles an authentic Chicago style beef sammy. Unfortunately, it did not taste like Chicago's. It was decent but nothing beats the real deal.

My wife ordered the "Chicago Authentic" hot dog and I must say, it tasted like those in Chicago. Right down to the bright green pickle relish. A hot is a hot dog though.

The sides however were great. We ordered the truffle fries and the fried zucchini. The fries were thick cut and not the shoestring style and it is a large serving. The zucchini is cut into french fry style and fried to crispy perfection.

I will not be frequenting this place or raving about it but it is a cool lil spot for a quick bite.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Go to McDonalds for a better burger but you won't find a better Hot Dog.

Maybe it was just a miss, but i've had hockey pucks that tasted better than this.  Bun was stale, burger tasted very funky, and 1 very old tomato.  Not worth $11, heck, not worth $3.

Otherwise, the staff looks burnt out, place is clean and well..over priced.< /Review>

<resp>None< /resp><text>Love this place! As an ex-Chicago native I'm always on the lookout for great Chicago style beef sandwiches. I was able to actually order a "Chessy beef, giardiniera peppers on the side, dipped" and they knew exactly what I was asking for...no huh? What do you want? The actual chef/owner is onsite and he really cares/wants to make sure you're satisfied. Awesome patio and outdoor seating. Great staff and did I mention the fries? Lot's of fries options with great dipping sauces. The fries are crispy and fresh. You owe it to yourself to check this place out...just not on Saturday at 2PM because that's when I plan on being there...lol.< /text><user_name>Dale PARKER< /user_name>< user>

<Text>Everything is delicious.  Their beef, chicken burgers are so fresh it's ridiculous. The salads are very generously portioned it will fill you up for days, and the fries are soooo good. Chef Andrew is attentive to detail and willing to give you suggestions on any food item and pairing with other items.<//Text>< pictures>

Classy grill with unique menu of exotic burgers, hot dogs and chicken sandwiches, beautiful meat creations with salads and comfort side dishes.  Compete with  actual Cheese Cake Factory - cheese cake. Plus,  Country Rock, playing this is a great place to take a date before an event or movie. Friendly and fast service.<//Review>

Food is fine. What annoys is 7% service charge. I asked what it was about and the manager spouted a well rehearsed “it’s to provide employees a working wage”. That’s lame! I say Pay them more and charge more for your food. This to enable ownership to maintain their required profit margin. My bbq beef sandwich (their basic sandwich) of $13.00 and soda of $2.50 was $15.50. 9.25% tax ( $1.43) and 7% service charge ($1.09) made a grand total of $18.
Food was fine. Value is a BIG NO.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Just ordered takeout for the first time...wife and I each had the Classic Beef sandwhich with sweet & hot peppers with au jus on the side for dipping (AWESOME!!!). Hold the peppers if you don't like spicy but if you do, it's very tasty. Wife couldn't finish hers and gave some to our 11 year old son, nice size portion. Ordered corn dogs and fries for the kids (they loved them), need to order more than one next time for my 11 year old, 9 year old was fine with one. Wife had a side salad (basic - will skip next time) and I had an order of onion rings (best I've had in the area). I've been wanting to come to this place ages ago, sorry it took so long - we will be adding this place to our regular local spots. For those concerned about covid, every employee had a mask on, the place is spotless inside and social distancing is in practice while waiting for your order. Overall, loved our first takeout experience!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Beware - 7% service fee included to bill without warning!  I wasn't even served, I did a takeout order. 🤔
I got an overpriced ruben sandwich - $13 before tax. Flavor is good but amount is too little for that price. I'd probably give it $9-11 value at most. If I were really hungry, it wouldn't have filled me.
I won't be back.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I had the bbq burger and thought it was a bit on the pricey side that doesn't come with a side. The flavour was okay. It's hard to compete with other fast casual spots out there.< /Text>

< review>
Had their Italian Beef today.  It's close to the ones I used to get from Chicago, but these are a little bland.  Nevertheless, it's the best we found so far at the bay area.< /review>

Finally a beef from Chicago. Similar to AL’s but more pepper. To much spice cuts the authentic Chicago flavor. I’d cut down on the peppery spice and go closer to Pizanos on Wabash recipe. All in all good to be able to finally get an Italian Beef. Hot dog worked out well, they snap and squeak when you chew them, flavor excellent, bun exactly what it should be. Fries excellent. Sticker shock on Price for one pup, fries and small drink, should be more affordable but it’s Bay Area I suppose. Price makes it something other than comfort food. Young woman taking order had excellent customer service. Will return. What about an authentic pizza like , Pizanos, Malnatis, maybe Gino’s, Nancy’s, nothing around here comes even close, nothing,  they are all wannabes.< /Review>

<Text>It is a great pizza parlor! I have eaten here several times, while living in Olive Ridge apartments, and going to Cal Poly Pomona. The meals were delicious, I cannot complain about that. Place was spacious to sit down and enjoy  the meal, furthermore, they would allow take out orders. The establishment was clean. Of course, my description can be outdated, since I have been in 2015. However, I have good memories dealing with this business, and for that reason, I am leaving five star rating!< /Text>< Pictures>

Very good food, they always give plenty of toppings.
They will even customize a pizza for you, just ask.  I brought them raw shrimp and they put it on a pizza, came out great! Can't beat the prices.  Get their huge square pizza.  Family owned.<//Review>

Planet motorsports is a great place to go for tires and wheels, and even lift kits. Talked with Omar and he was able to get me the exact tire and rim I needed in less than a week of purchase. Great prices and will work with you.< /Review>

Great customer service! I was able to shop online and have Omar helped price match American Tire Co. I was in and out with new wheels and tires in an hour and a half. Smooth and easy transaction without the pressure of buying too much. I will definitely recommend this place. Also beware that there is no large curb sign for the shop. Go slow on Capitol and you can't miss it.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I met Omar totally by chance on offerup. I asked a couple questions, to feel him out, and his responses were fast and helpful. He had a tire in a size I found ideal and the price was the same if not cheaper than if I bought the tires online plus installation was free! You can not ask for better, if you buy online at a minimum you can expect to pay $100 or more for installation plus having to wait for them to arrive...it becomes a hassle. I am old school when I pay for something I expect to get that something right then and there.

So long story short very satisfied more than satisfied actually. There is a golden rule in bodyshops you can get it cheap fast or good, pick two but never get the third. I got all three and that is really saying something. Also the tires are tough to get on I have 265 35 18s on 18x8 rims. The fitment is a dream come true. I wasnt sure it was possible but in my mind I had an idea of the perfect look and Omars magician tech in the back brought it to life. Five stars! Shop here confidently.< /Review>< pics>

Great prices and amazing selection of rims and tires. They were able to fit me in right away mount balance and put four new tires on my truck and all this was done on a lunch break. I was able to return back to work on time and take care of something I have been putting off. They are guaranteed to have the best prices in town!</Review>

<text>Came to get new tires and lift kit for my Tundra.  I came on scheduled date and store wasn't opened till10:40am giving me excuse of traffic.  Started working on my truck and got done at 7:30pm.  I can clearly see these guys are struggling to put the lift kit. And tells me his taking time to do it correctly. After they got done, the steering wheel was off about 20 degrees.  So I came back to correct it.  Spend 2hrs and when I left the truck started to away left.  So I come back again and owner gives me BS about how expensive the equipment was and this was expected.  I lost complete competence and disgust how the owner treats his client.  Before I raced my voice all I asked was to get the job done right.  Very very disappointed.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
Planet motor sport is a great place to go. Went to get get a quote for tires. The manager was extremely helpful showed me different options on the tires that they had and could get. My tire size was not a regular tire size so they had to ship the tires to their store. It came fairly quickly. Also needed alignment for my vehicle and they where very accommodating. Fast foward 4 days when the tires got to the shop they called me and said the tires where there and I asked them could I come now since my tires where pretty much down to the belts so I couldn't wait any longer. They said yes that's fine. Went down waited for a couple of minutes handed them my keys. Watched them take it to the garage. They put it on the alignment rack changed the tires and did the alignment. Very friendly and honest people. Got my keys back drove the car fairly sporty on a back road and got more grip than before. A+++ shop definitely will recommend.< /Review>

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Went in for new rims and tires, I took the suggestion of the salesman and was completely unhappy with the results. They wouldn’t give me a refund or an exchange. If you’re looking for new rims and tires I suggest you find a different spot.< /review>

<text>We came in and ordered tires, rims, and leveling kit. The man here was very honest when working with financing through Snap which we appreciated after another company down the street tried to swindle my husband and I out of $400 for taxes, which we knew was wrong and dishonest. We asked him if he was sure he was suppose to charge us the $400 thinking maybe his company was new working Snap & he said yes we do it on every sell. We had just closed out an account with Snap so we knew that's not how it works. So we left. Coming to this tire shop the man was straight forward, professional, and honest & that's exactly the type of people we like to work with. I would highly recommend this place.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Got 2 of my tires replaced at Planet Motorsport and my car has been shaking ever since at highway speed, making it unsafe. They're not even willing to do anything to get it right. Now i am just stuck with 2 brand new garbage tires we paid for and they wont take back. Do yourself a favor and go to a place like America's tires that stand by their customer satisfaction. You wont be sorry like I am. Oh, and they also managed to scratch my rims while swapping the tires too. Wish i could give them negative stars. Ugh!</Text>

These guys are top rate in my view. Bought tires and rims for my Suburban. Great price but the service was better. No funny business, nothing remotely shady, just a few guys working hard and taking care of business. I would highly recommend this tire shop to anyone who's looking for that type of service.<//Review>

Good fast service, they have the best prices in San José, I did a research before purchasing 4 new tires
And they had the best price, I’m happy with their services, definitely I’ll recommend them.<//text>

When someone asks you a price for tires installed, you should give them out the door price not half as price and then start adding disposal fee and taxes.

——-

Reply - say that over the phone before hand not when people drive all the way to you and then you tell them a different price..... ! That’s annoying and deceiving ! You did the same thing to the other guy in there as well. Quoted him $1300 then $1500 20 mins later then $1600. Rookie behaviour !</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The owner is not a loyal deal man and had the nerve to show zero respect after scammed me.  My contract was at $1970.00 and shot up $500 after 5 months of payments of $360.  He uses WestCreek Financial and claims he knows nothing.  Purchasing my tires and rims from his shop was the biggest mistake.< /Review>

If you are looking for a good coffee and impeccable service, this place is the best to go. The chairs and couch were very comfortable. And also, the restroom is well designed and maintained. Everything about this coffee shop is excellent. I really love to go back here together with my friends, family members, and loved ones. Thank you very much!<//Text>

This is the cutest, most humble place I've been too in a very long time. They serve diabetic friendly foods, and are very attentive to your dietary needs. The food is fresh, delicious, and made to order. If you have no idea what you're about to order, they gladly and pleasantly make suggestions. Everyone should visit this place at least once! I know I will be a regular.< /text>

My husband and I walked in to order a drink. Unfortunately, we saw one of the employees without a mask go right into the kitchen. After touching a couple of things, he put his mask on.

We walked right out.

It seems nice and family owned, but that's a big health violation.</Review>

< Review>
I stopped in here as I was making my way back from the farmer's market. They had lots if goodies to purchase, and even have a kitchen with many choices of food. I only stopped to get something sweet, like a dessert, so I opted for a cookie they had. It was a Luscious Lemon Poppyseed cookie. So I can't say much about any if their food items on the menu, as I have not tried any. But realizing how much they did have, I will have to try some if their items in the next visit.

Their seating area is fairly big, as you wouldn't expect that from the outside looks of it. But to the left there is a large seating area. Place looks clean and well organized. Staff was friendly. I wish I would have stayed longer to leave a more detailed review, but so far so good guys, keep up the good work.</Review>

My favorite place to eat breakfast. Awesome portions and delicious food. Best coffee I have ever had (technical had a dirty green tea - had a shot of espresso). The staff is super friendly and I love supporting our small business. Super cozy.< /Text>

Great place for comfort food and just downright delicious food. The girl that helped us in the front was amazing! Super helpful. Once she knew that it was our first time she walked us through everything we needed to know. Food was delicious! We purchased a 5150 (pastrami sandwich), a sausage and egg croissant, and fruity pebble French toast. Everything was great! Wish I could go everyday, but not possible lol< /Text>

The food and prices here are the best in downtown Riverside. It is a cozy place to pull in for a coffee drink, good breakfast or lunch. The staff are really nice and genuinely friendly too. I love this place only 2 blocks from my office.< /Text>

<text>This place is cute and cozy. The workers here were amazing and the food was good! They charge extra if you split your food, i loved the coffee on my first visit and i did not care for it the second time i went. They have lots of lunch options!!</text><UserId.>112606713747923883233</UserId.>< Date>

Not only are the portions and quality amazing for the price, but everyone who works there is always smiling and welcoming. The owners really set the tone for good customer service and it shows in the personality of everyone there. Highly recommend this place as a regular breakfast/lunch stop if you work locally.<//review>

The food is great. Don't go there if you're counting calories. The customer service is off the charts. And its a place to chill and hangout.. Oh btw if you love coffee...drink up... Its definitely the place to be...</text>

<Review>We went to The Pines Steakhouse around 2pm last Sunday to treat my wife for a good quality steak for Mother’s Day.

They told us that they don’t do reservations and they will re-open at 5pm (First come first serve according to them) we went up at 4pm to make sure we are first in line. But when they opened their doors at 5pm, we were told that they’re fully book!

I was obviously upset and wanted to leave but then they told me that we can eat at the bar.

What I find so unfair and misleading is that at first they said that they don’t do reservations and once they opened, all of a sudden they’re fully booked?? So much for me treating my wife for a romantic meal… we ended up eating at the bar is not romantic at all…

The reason I gave 3 star is because in fairness, their steaks are really good except for their mash potatoes sides which taste average. But I was definitely not happy with them making me and my wife looked stupid and had to wait for an hour and was eventually told that they’re fully booked all of a sudden after opening their doors? And kinda disappointed that that special day we ended up in a bar instead of a table.< /Review>< response>
{'time': 1620865647673, 'text': "Hi Alexander -\nSorry for the confusion. We are open every day from 5-10pm and have reservations available on our Website >>> https://sanmanuel.com/venue/pines. We were sold out for Mother's Day, but have bar seating on a first-come, first served basis. Apologies on the confusion. Hope you had a wonderful Mother's Day and would love to have you and your wife back in the future.\n-San Manuel Casino"}</response>

Food is delicious, would recommend the prime rib and duck (although duck is small, it's filling for me). The raspberry cheesecake was very good.</Text>

I went there for my birthday.   It was not my first visit.  Food and live music along with a very nice ambiance make it a great place for any special occasion.  The service was very good, not excellent. However, everyone was professional and manager checked in on guest experience.  Who knows, maybe I'll celebrate another birthday there.<//Review>

<review>Pictured from the bottom, you see a bread basket which was served warm and with a herb butter, then some small fresh and delicious bite which I forgot what it was exactly but enjoyed it, then shrimp cocktail, 2 aged new York's, one with mushrooms and onion, and a shared baked potato plus dessert of creme brulee and a fruit tart.  The service was excellent and each part of the meal was top notch.  The bread basket had a couple of different types of bread and they all tasted freshly baked, the shrimp cocktail was perfectly chilled and the steaks were tender, prepared perfectly as requested and good to the last bite.  The desserts were equally as good and it was an all around awesome dinner with great service and nice ambiance.  We enjoyed. Recommend.</review>< Pictures>

Last week was the first time we came to that fine restaurant. But It is absolutely not the last time. We enjoyed the evening very much with the efficient service, with the fine  dishes and fine drinks and with the decent price. We will no doubt return there soon.< /Review>

We always enjoy coming here. It is our anniversary today and they were kind enough to give us free dessert. Also, the appetizers were a little late in coming out, so they tell us, and they comped our appetizers😊 Truly great customer service! They go above and beyond! You are never without drink or someone checking on you! Love the staff! Food is Amazing! Will be back! Thanks to Frank, Alex, Karina and Monte!</Text>

I absolutely love a good steakhouse and I can say that I truly enjoyed my dining experience here. When they say modern in the name, they truly do mean it. The decor is quite modern and I think that truly adds to the experience. My server was wonderfully friendly and provided a level of service you expect at a place that charges this much. I ordered a ribeye and I can say it was superb. It was cooked exactly the way I wanted it.I also added the brie with bacon topping that truly made for a wonderful meal. I had a great experience from start to finish.< /text>

The ambiance is quite wonderful. The menu is one of the best from the Sea Food to the all different types of Steaks made to perfection. No where else have I even tried to compare to the Pines. Always a great pleasure and ohhhhhh, the Tomahawk steak!!!!!!! Must try!< /text>

It was during peak dinner hour and we didn't realize we should have gotten reservations; however, they very graciously offered a two person table.  Every single person who helped us was fantastic, and not just to us, we observed the excellent service for every table, ( even the rude customers). Our waiter was brand new but still great, the person training him treated my husband and I like royalty and we were very appreciative.  The food was absolutely delicious and portions were generous.  I really loved the calamari, it had the perfect texture and not rubbery like most restaurants. We would love to come back for our anniversary!</text>< pics>

Its really nice if you have the budget... If your a normal person looking for a steak dinner this is a normal Saturday night joint. Plane on spending about 30 to 50 a plate average. So with those kind of numbers it's not a family place. Its aimed towards adults who want fancy. The steak was however extremely good!! Good size cuts, warm bread to start, and clean modern display. Service is however on the slower side compared to other restaurants... But maybe that's a fancy thing? Anyways its a high end joint located inside a casino on the second floor that has an impressive set-up aimed towards adults who don't mind spending a hundred or two on a steak meal in a fancy place.< /Text>

The restuarant is inside the casino. Convenient place for fine dining if you're already there. Excellent service from Molly! Very nice atmosphere with live singers. The menu lacks the inspiration I would expect. The was food was not bad or great, just okay. Food wise, there are better places to spend that kind of money.< /review>

<Text>The Pines! You won't be disappointed with the food quality. The food is fantastic, and the atmosphere is very relaxing considering the restaurant is in a casino.

The taste is as good as the pictures look. Every dish has a distinct and delicious taste... it's a great place for family or couple dining!
The steaks are great! The french onion soup is amazingly flavorful!

The Sunday brunch is amazing! Its $40 but well worth the price. They have thick cut prime rib, shrimp, and crab legs as well!
The staff is amazing and very attentive to customers needs.< /Text><resp>{'time': 1537714180283, 'text': 'Sunny-\nThanks for the five stars! Please follow us @SanManuelCasino. Glad you enjoyed all aspects of your meal.\n\nSee you again soon.\n-San Manuel Casino'}< /resp></record></dataset><record>

2 friends and myself went there yesterday to try the signature seafood tower that was recommended to my friend. She also had received a $50 credit from the casino that we used. We thought it cost $80 but it turns out it was actually market price and was $100 for the small and $165 for the large. We opted for the small but were surprised by how much seafood was on it. It was really, really good and had lobster tails, very large crab legs and huge claws already cut open and easy to get the meat out of, big shrimp and oysters. They provided fresh breads with this delicious butter with apricots and jalepenos. Absolutely delicious! Well worth the price, we all left very full.< /Text>

<Time>1561564007586<//Time><rate>2< /rate><Review>The food here is good but the atmosphere falls well below expectations for such an expensive restaurant. It seems as though most of the customers are sent in straight from the casino floor and no one is concerned with a dress code. The ambience was just far more casual than we were hoping for and wasn't worth the huge markup for the food. For a particularly special occasion (and a very high bill), The Pines was a disappointment.</Review>< pics>

The food and ambiance are amazing! Live, soft rock music being played, separate dining rooms, all with her own personality... My friend had the prime rib, and I had the pork chop with blackberry sauce and broccolini 😍... Ten stars!!! Our waiter, Robert, was well versed and knowledgeable in the areas of fine wines and champagnes...  We enjoyed a bottle of Ferghettina with our meal! OMG! Everything was excellent! 😍💞😋< /review>

Visited The Pines restaurant last evening for a company function.

I ordered the Japanese Wagyu A5 steak. Price was $100/5 oz. I was surprised! Not because of the tiny sized portion but then again it was listed as 5 oz.

My surprise was due to the complete lack of flavor. The steak was tender but what good is steak without flavor. I'm not talking about saving the meal by masking it with seasoning and so called steak sauce.

In addition, one of our guest ordered an over priced side of green beans that never arrived to the table until we were ready to leave.

All-in-all, it was a great evening. I recommend you visit at you're own risk.<//text>

This is such a beautiful restaurant. Love the atmosphere, Such a quiet relaxing place. I wish i remembered our waitress name, very sweet and helpful. I couldn't decide which meat i wanted, she described all the different choices of the cuts. I went with filet mignon which was so delicious. Cooked perfectly so tender. I also chose the mashed potatoes which were so Creamy n delicious. I am definitely coming back here again.< /text>

<Review>Here’s the thing about steakhouses in Las Vegas: every major hotel and casino has one... and most of ‘em are really, really good. (And that’s not to mention all the ones that aren’t in a hotel or casino.) Deciding on the perfect place to sink your teeth into a tender piece of meat can be tough. If somebody would just put together a complete guide to Sin City’s best steak spots... oh, wait! My bad ....
We are in Pines Modern Steakhouse at the San Manuel Casino.
Savor the flavors and freshness of delicious and unprecedented cuisine in the modern sophistication and elegance of this remodeled Venue.

Dine from a revamped and updated dinner menu featuring cutting-edge flavors and dishes. The menu features organic and locally sourced produce with an exclusive brand of some of the most sought after WAGYU BEEF on the planet. and the freshest and finest seafood delivered daily. The Pines Steakhouse will create a delectable dining experience unparalleled in the Inland Empire.

An extensive wine list housing some of the world’s most magnificent wines has been crafted to complement the flavors and excitement of the extraordinary new menu.

This energetic fine dining spot could be the best reason to visit Southern California just for the STEAKS!
What sets it apart: You might be getting the best-prepared steaks in the World never mind the good ole USA. Snow Beef? Are you kidding me ?  No I am not actually for those of you do not know about Snow Beef here is some great information.
The Japanese Black Wagyu cattle are raised at Chateau Uenae Lake Farm, a private reserve in Hokkaido, which is the northernmost part of Japan where it gets very cold. The cold climate is what creates the unique meat quality and allows the beef to become as delicate as a snowflake, thus the name Snow Beef.

With only one to two cattle per month qualifying for Chateau Uenae's top designation, Hokkaido "Snow Beef" is the rarest steak on the planet. Its also happens to be the best steak we've ever have tasted prepared with precise perfection.
With robust yet incredibly delicate marbling, this is Special, Chic, Majestic and a Graceful Cut of Beef.
As an avid foodie I have never ever seen this jewel on any menu including Japan..
The Service is impeccable, The Ambiance is Warm, The Food is Outrageous and there WAGYU BEEF is a mouth watering experience.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I'm not happy with this place. Where do I start?

Service overall is slow. Had to consistently flag down my server for help as well as remind them that my bread does need butter too. Once food was ordered the wait was extensive and ultimately had to send waiter to the kitchen to find out what was going on.

Quality of the food is definitely lacking. We ordered a beet salad and while the beets were cooked well, the rest of the salad was bland. Also ordered shrimp marinara pasta and the pasta itself was completely tasteless and needed more cheese and seasoning.. like really bad.

Lastly, ordered a ribeye steak MEDIUM.. steak initially tasted good but slightly over salted but cooked perfectly on the OUTTER edges. As we got more towards the center of the steak we noticed that the meat was completely undercooked on the rare side. Our server clearly saw how rare it was but did nothing.

Plates piled and piled and nobody took initiative to remove our plates. Very annoying and shows a lack of basic fundamental service here. No need to return.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

She gave good suggestions for our drink orders and checked in on us occassionally to make sure everything was alright. The atmosphere was also decent and semi-upscale, considering the location. That aside, I was just not blown away by the food. The bone-in ribeye steak I received was decent but nothing to write home about. If I were judging solely based on the taste of the steak and the overall ambience, I would probably rate my experience at 4 stars. Sadly, the sides ordered by my party were all disappointing to say the least. The mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were bland and basic, and the baked potato ordered at our table was undercooked. If sides are important to your dining experience, you might want to go somewhere else. I realize most people only visit a steakhouse for the steak, in which case I would argue that there are still better alternatives elsewhere, particularly for the price.</Text><time>1529358681187</time>< rate>

We finally found a day to celebrate  our Anniversary which was about a couple of weeks ago. I loved the experience, the food was delicious and our servers were very tentative eventhough it was very busy. The live music was GREAT! and before we left we got a card with hand written messages from the staff, that sure brought a tear down my cheek,  it made us feel special. Defenetly made our night memorable. Thank you!</Text>

The service was SLOW and the servers appeared to be a little disorganized. Also to my surprise, my waitress was a Vegan!?!? She couldn't even give me a recommendation on some of the food I was ordering! After all those issues, the food turned out to be very average.  The drinks were very well made but overall very pricey. This is more a casual dinning spot and NOT a high end steak house.</Review>

We went to the pines steakhouse at San Manuel yesterday evening April 30th it was horrible we got there a little bit before 7 we did not get our food until about 8:35 8:40 wasn't even hot I asked for filet mignon medium and it was well done no pink very overcooked mashed potatoes were lukewarm didn't even melt the butter my husband got the special which was a 16 oz steak and steak potatoes with a BBQ Chipotle the potatoes were dry and cold l the steak was like leather of course management came over and apologized and apologized and offered us a desert and and wanted to pay for the meal the problem is we didn't go there to have our meal pay for or to get a free dessert we went there to get a good meal and pay for it and unfortunately this is not the first time this has happened at the steakhouse andwe're overbooked we're overcrowded when we left there was a line almost out the door and there continuously trying to see people and even our waiter said that they were overbooked and allowing too many people to come inw for the type of service we were getting<//Text>

Very good customer service. Cory was great, my husband had the American wagyu and Japanese waygu A5. He would go with the American wagyu if we go back. Japanese waygu, to much hype about it and wasn't that good. I also tryed it.</review>

<username>Maria Sanchez< /username><text>I agree with many. I used to be a Fri regular, Latin night. Now, I have to say it is the worst place I've been to. The music sucks because the dj clearly does not know how to listen to her crowd. She would finally play a good song and everyone would run to the dance floor, 3 seconds later, she would switch it... extremely annoying!!! They seriously need to talk to the DJ, because we, the crowd, are the business!!!  Latin night NEEDS to come back!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c354f88d44c1af:0x746de4c268eba5f</Gmap_id><Date>1466138702971< /Date>< Rating>

<review>Wow! Where to begin. We had a reservation for six a couple of weeks back on a Saturday night. Three couples with kids....and babysitters - Parents' Night Out! We had a round of cocktails - me with my Manhattan (delicious), Monica with her wine, and Len had his first Old Fashioned - apparently he LOVES them now. I may have created a monster here. The manager Frank came and visited us and made sure we were having a great time...we were. I did the 32oz Longbone Ribeye - I felt like it was the Flintstone's! Or the Great Outdoors. And yes I enjoyed every ounce...we did reference the Great Outdoors and did yet another toast - this time to the late great John Candy. :( Also had a side a of asparagus and a delicious Wedge Salad. We also shared a few deserts that were also fantastic! It was a great time. We will be back!<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Had a Great time with My husband last night!! I never take the time to write reviews, but we promised our server Jack that we would because we had such a great time.

The Pines is a beautiful restaurant with modern twist and elegant decor. The only complaint I have is the fact that they don't have a restroom in house!! So you are forced to go back out onto the casino floor into a cloud of second hand smoke and unpleasant loud noises.

When we entered the Pines the nice hostesses greeted us courteously however we would have rather sat at a booth instead of a small table for 2 where one of us had to sit with our back facing the live band that they had to offer. The menus were extremely fancy all of their menus were made of an extravagant wood finish.But we were greeted warmly by our server Jack, an extremely charming and professional(very good looking as well) young man that made up for it. He was able to offer me my favorite Cakebread Chardonnay at a discounted price ($70 for an entire bottle!!!what a bargain) he walked us through the menu and set us up with a 3 course meal that complimented the wine wonderfully. The food was fantastic, both my husbands ribeye and my burger were cooked to perfection, hats off to the chef.  He stopped by to check on us often,  and made sure that we tried their house made steak sauces, and had everything we needed through the entire meal.  Even though we could see he had several other tables and was quite busy. I especially loved the way he served out wine, the way her poured each glass was SUPER CLASSY.

If you ever find yourself around the Highland area looking for a great dining experience I Would definitely recommend making your way over to the pines. The place is a bit pricy but, definitely worth it, if you want to  spoil you and your hubby with. And make sure you ask for Jack!!</Review>

The new pines is terrible! I was a regular every Friday. Latino night was the best and now they dont have it anymore. The atmosphere sucks. Too much light and the music sucks too. Fyi, a lot of business is going to be lost. Im sure i speak for everyone.< /review>

Your dinner starts with a bread service of cheesy herb pull-apart rolls served in a cast-iron skillet. Get your hands on one before they disappear! Your dining mate may fight you for them. They are so good! Rating: 4.9/5

Hurricane ($12) features their own blend of fresh fruits and Zaya Rum and is served in a frosted tiki glass. If you have ever been to Pat O’Briens in New Orleans, you will absolutely love The Pines version. It is tropical in flavor yet packs a punch with the Zaya Rum. Rating: 5/5

Crab Cakes ($18) are made with jumbo lump crab and roasted red pepper, and served with a creole remoulade and mango foam. The crab cakes are amazing! Lots of crab meat and not a lot of filler. The only thing that doesn’t really match is the mango foam. The flavor is too sweet and seemed to overpower the delicate, succulent flavor of the crab. Sample a little first before utilizing it on the crab cakes. Rating: 4.7/5

Veal Meatballs ($12) are served with organic Pomodoro, parmigiana reggiano, and basil. The sauce has an excellent balance of sweet and savory. But the veal may be a little too delicate of a flavor for the bold sauce. Maybe a mix of veal and beef or pork and beef might be better to lend its flavor to the mix. Rating: 4.3/5

Farmer’s Market Salad made with certified 100% organic kales, California oranges, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), and sherry. This is a refreshing salad for summer, but instead of grapefruit, blood orange might be a better citrus fruit to use. It will provide contrast with the deep green kale in both presentation and flavor. The bitterness in the grapefruit enhanced too much of the bitterness of the kale. Rating: 4/5

Longbone Ribeye ($80) is a 32 oz. bone-in steak that will inspire “oohs” and “ahhs” not only from the table, but from the entire restaurant as it carried through the dining room from the kitchen. An extra length of frenched bone is served with this ribeye. The steak is tender, juicy, flavorful, and perfectly grilled to your liking. It could use a tad more salt on the grill. Rating: 4.7/5

Prime Rib ($32 for 12 oz. or $38 for 16 oz.) is traditionally served with au jus and creamed horseradish. It is tender, juicy, and seasoned to perfection. The perfect temperature cut is selected just for you. The au jus is full of rich beef flavor. The horseradish is well-balanced with a creamy and spicy kick. Rating: 4.8/5

Cold Water Lobster Tail (market price) can be served either steamed or broiled. If you choose broiled option, a garlic butter is added to the lobster. It is broiled to perfection with succulent buttery flavor. The garlic works really well with the sweet lobster. Rating: 5/5

Red King Crab Legs (market price) can be served steamed or garlic roasted. If you choose the steamed option, the crab meat is perfectly steamed and served in sections for easy removal. The meat comes out cleanly indicating the crab is very fresh. Rating: 4.7/5

Signature Mashed Potatoes ($10) are like a twice-baked potato without the skin and mixed with bacon, cheese, and chives. The cheesy bacon flavor pairs well with the mash. The potatoes are very dense. It might be better whipped to provide a lighter consistency. Rating: 4.3/5

Cannoli ($8) is artfully filled and the ends are dipped in chocolate. Pistachio and mocha almond fillings were served. The ends are dotted with almonds and pistachios and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  The cannoli shells are perfectly crisp. The fillings are creamy and rich with flavors of pistachio, chocolate, and coffee. Mama mia! Rating: 5/5

Pines Chocolate “Peak” ($8) is an amazing dessert to share, especially if you are celebrating birthday or anniversary. The inside is a wedge of chocolate layered cake flipped up to make a “mountain peak”. It is encased in a chocolate shell and the “peak” is sprinkled with powdered sugar to emulate snow. It will pull at the heartstrings of any chocoholic! Rating: 5/5< /review>

Had a free smog and they wouldn't honor it. He said it was expired after a year. Since you can only smog your vehicle every two years that made no sense.. plus said he would give  us the coupon deal but yet it was the same price on the wall. Very very frustrated with this, I made a call to GS Smog & repair  with no appointment needed and for 60.00 we got our paperwork back and went there. The staff at GS smog were excellent and funny new smog place for sure!!!!</review>

<Review>Couldn't ask more from a smog shop. Affordable price, get you in and out really quickly, techs were friendly enough. I don't think you could ask for a better smog shop. Just be aware they are cash or check only.< /Review>< Pics>

These guys are great. Reasonable prices for smog checks with the coupon on their website. Only issue is they don't take credit/debit cards, and parking is insufficient and awkward.</Review>

I had a HORRIBLE experience with Automotive Excellence in Placerville and these guys made it all better. They charged me a TOTAL $200 to evaluate the problem with my car enough to make a decision on what to do with it. While Automotive Excellence wanted me on the hook for $500 of DIAGNOSTICS ALONE with ZERO guarantee they would figure out what was wrong with it and without doing a single repair (and they had my car for a whole week)... something this place did in one day and only charged me $200 which was extremely kind since he had already done some legwork in finding the old parts. Thank you so much for being honest. I would trust this place with any vehicle I own.</Review>< Pics>

Without a doubt, the very best of the best in automotive repair, plus the only establishment to trust when it comes to smog certification. The mechanics are some of the best in the county and they'll take the stress out of the smog certification process. Let's face it, the whole process of getting ones car smogged can be a sheer nightmare. Not with AUTOTECH,  you'll be glad you went there.<//Review>

<text>This is a nice, small spot for some popcorn chicken and shrimp. I think the chicken is called "karate chicken" lol? Anyways this is definitely more of a snack-type spot, nothing really stands out as far as what you'd call a complete meal. I say that but the shrimp has nearly gotten me full! We also ordered the chamango drink and while it's not my cup of tea (no pun intended) wifey enjoyed it.<//text>< Pictures>

I love Tastea, it's been awhile since I've been able to get in. Obviously because of the current situation. However, if they have some kind of contactless pickup system, I would highly recommend this place. My favorite drink here is the Kryptonite matcha green tea smoothie. I first tried it with regular boba, but then I tried thier honey boba. It's fantastic!!🤓I can't get enough of it!!👍👍< /text>

They messed up my order which wasn’t a big deal they just didn’t give me my boba I asked for. When I went in there the lady was super rude with a bad attitude. I asked her kindly why there was no boba in my drink and she said it was my fault I didn’t ask and if I wanted it then I would have to go pay for it . I checked my recipe they had already charged me for the boba. Not only were they rude and messed up my order the tea wasn’t even good.< /Review>

Clean and cozy, well-equipped for COVID-19 precautions,  a great place for an exotic smoothie-type drink or snack. I enjoyed trying something new and different. There is an Asian influence in the menu.<//review>

Their quality has really gone spectacularly downhill. Today I had the displeasure of ordering the worst jasmine milk tea I’ve ever had in my life. The tea tasted bitter, verging on soapy, and I could count the number of boba they added on my fingers. Atrocious.

On the upside, the taro was at least barely mediocre.< /review>

I was just there, I asked for 4 Taro tea, blended with boba, but didn’t get the boba. I even paid extra for one to have extra boba and I didn’t even get that. I repeated the order twice to the girl working there, and she got my order wrong.</text>

< Review>
This is a gluten free review.

Gluten free menu: No, but GF items clearly marked

What I ordered: Karate Chicken with Buttload’a Fries (this is a funny item to order. Feels weird to say it lol)

Gluten free options: 5/5
The whole menu is gluten free

Food: 3/5
The chicken and fries are HOT and fresh. I’m not a huge fan of the Tastea dust. This seasoning is very strong. I wish it was a little less overwhelming. Both the fries and nuggets are very “heavy”. I can usually only eat about half of it before I feel like I need a salad or something healthy. There’s not a lot of places where you can have gluten free chicken nuggets in Orange County (I know of two places).

The smoothies and teas are awesome. So much variety. I especially love the summer flavors.

Service: 4/5
Chicken and fries took about 15 mins to come out, but it was very fresh. Usually takes 5 mins for a drink order.

Location: 4/5
This center can get pretty busy, but fortunately Tastea is in a less crowded part of the center. Parking isn’t difficult to find.

Ambiance: 2/5
Comfortable seating. Nothing special about the space.

Price: 4/5
Prices are reasonable.

Overall score: 4/5< /Review>

Will totally give a 5/5 for boba because it’s super unique. Got the lychee freeze and it came with rainbow jelly and little bits of actually lychee, which I’ve never had anywhere else. And the boba is green. I thought they were giving me green peas🍏 lol. However, the service is rather poor. My drink never came out and it was never even on their board of drinks to make so I waited extra and had to retell the lady what I ordered. To make matters worse, my friend was #1 on the drink board but she waited 12 minutes 😱for them to make her drink. And people after her had their drinks served before her. And she only ordered one simple thing. The ladies working there at night are extremely noob and we saw a few other people waiting extra long and talking to her for extra drinks. Tisk tisk. 👎< /Text>

<review>In the crossroad shopping center, can be a bit tricky to found parking. I order a Thai iced tea, Boba was extra charge. For $6 a bit pricy for a large, a bit to sweet but the Boba was nice and soft. I've had Boba that were hard and rubbery. Staff can be a bit impatient if you don't know what to order. Busy on hot days.</review>< Pics>

Tastea is tasty indeed! I have been waiting for this location to open and it's finally open!  My personal favorites are the Lychee Peachee and the Bootea Shaker. Always in 32oz and always with an order of Karate Chicken at spice level 2 (out of 5). Very clean location and friendly staff.< /review>

Every time that i’ve gone to In N Out tires it’s always been a good experience. From the guys working on the cars to the people inside and even the owner are always helpful. Prices are very affordable, i’ve been going for a couple years now and will continue.</Text>

I had a nail in my tire and the tire shop that I usually go too was closed (Sunday)! My mom recommended me this shop, and when I drove in they were reallllyyy busy (which is always a good sign). The shop is large and has plenty of workers. The worker was able to patch up my tire in literally less than 15 minutes and it cost only 10$</review>

They did a horrible alignment on my car, went back to let them know and started blaming other things like my rack and pinion. i’ve got several opinions after in & out tire & nothing wrong with my car. everyone has said i got a bad alignment. worse experience ever.</Review>

If I could give zero stars I would. I worked for this company and never got my paycheck I contacted every manager, the owner himself and anyone I can possibly contact and they refuse to pay me I would go on saying so much about this company but I rather them see this and send me the money they owe rather than say what a lot of customers deal with with this company.
(By the way a lot of this reviews are actually made by workers and friends of people that work there)</Review>

Best local tire service, if you aren't looking to spend all day only to get new tires.  These guys  provided a much needed alignment service and new tires in no time, very nice & clean waiting area.  Can't beat hygiene now in days, (Covid-19) keep up the good work and great customer service!  📓🖋</review>

Honestly it was worth the wait, They’re we’re many rims that caught my attention , the styles they have here are really good, the tires are great as well. I also got my brakes replace for a great price. Got everything done in a reasonable time , came out with some clean 24” inch rims which made my Chevy Tahoe look one hundred aka the way I wanted it.

I was very satisfied  with my services. The mechanic tells you exactly what's wrong with your car and what I liked was that he also showed me what was wrong with my car before doing anything to it.

Horrible service. Took my car for an alignment they told me to buy 2 parts that were old and required replacement. Bought the parts, installed them no problem. 1 day later I was driving stuck in traffic when my my whole wheel pops out and I was stuck in traffic for 4 hours. I had damage to my car panels and they were not responsible for it. The new part I took for them to install wasn't even installed. They simply put in my old part and returned my car to me. Horrible service 1/10 I would not reccomend this place to nobody.</Review>

THE place to be when you need to groom your tires and wheels. All the staffs were good and honest.. The office was clean  and got humongous selections of tires and wheels. Just ask for Steve and considered it done...< /Review>

Poor customer service, they don’t acknowledge you right away and false advertising. At least that’s what happened today with me on my first visit. I came in to simply remove old tires on some wheels that I had on my trunk. Reading over Yelp that they service any type of car from Lambs to Honda’s so I figured why not come in? I gave it a shot then the representative that helped me ‘Hispanic lady’ refused to help me even if I offered to pay double. She gave me several excuses that did not make any sense and told me, Sorry we don’t do those wheels here. My wheels where not fancy or even 3pc or starched they are simple I told her. I pointed out all the fancy wheels they had on display and asked her why not work on mine? Anyway I guess it wasn’t enough commission for her to attend me.. hope she understands how upset I’ll just take my business elsewhere..</Review>

This is the best tire place I've ever did business with . All the staff was courteous and the manager Manuel was very helpful in making sure I got the best deal for my money when it came to getting my front end rebuilt and some new rims and tires .... they're the best .</Review>

Purchased a rim and tire package and was set to come in the next day to get it installed. While doing some research online, I found a better rim with a better offset for my vehicle and was willing to pay the difference to get these rims instead. I assumed it wouldn't be a problem since the shop is a distributor for the same company of the rim. Called the next day and they said they only are distributors for the tires of the brand, not the rims. I said no problem, I will order the rims and still get the tires since they are the same brand and I wanted them to match. They no longer wanted my business because they weren't profiting from me sourcing the rims myself and they wouldn't assist in helping me get them, only offered a refund since I paid in advance. Even said to get the tires somewhere else too, and that's exactly what I did. Took my business elsewhere. If I'm spending almost 2 G's, I have every right to change my mind on what I want, just like you have the right to refuse my business because you got mad I wanted a different rim and it was going to eat into your profit margin. I went to STW in La Habra and they made some calls and sourced the rims for me next day. People can make there own conclusion from this review.</Review>

I’ve never taken time out of my day to rate a tire shop BUT THIS SPOT REALLY BLEW ME AWAY. I came in for alignment & while another place was charging me $90 this place charged me only $50. The customer service is Amazing! They have a very clean office with toys for the kids to play with & really comfortable chairs & sofas. I ended up needing two new tires & insead of just telling me, the mechanic made me put on gloves & showed me WHY i needed them. There was a huge bump on them! If I would’ve gotten an alignment only the wheels could’ve bursted at any time. The total was $180 but the owner lowered it to $160 for everything. The tires came with a 40k warranty. They are really honest. This will be the only place i will be coming to for any tire needs from now on.

Side note: while i was in the waiting room i over heard that another customer’s service was going to take 3 hours & the owner offered to take them home!</Text>

<Review>October 30 buy set of tires and wheels air pressure sensors the next day my car is not reading rear sensor due to lack of time I could not go that day but I return on November 6 that I checked everything is fine until there happened that the person who was checking it did not know what he was doing to reprogram and left all that time the lights of my car on drain my new battery then says that those sensors are old which are supposed to be new that they put my car is a land rover lr3 thing that that car will not start if I do not have the right voltage that happened I went for something so simple this young man deprogrammed my car completely they say that it can not happen but if it happened now they do not take care of the problem that my truck call the dealer they charge expensive that kind of problem I do not recommend that they take their cars to this place bad experience with those mechanics who do not know how to work that type of programming and bad attitude that night of those peopleI felt like discrimination when you buy are sweet you have problems do not help you<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

AMAZING Prices!!

I needed 4 new tires and In and Out was on the way into my office in downtown. I stopped by for a quote and the prices were absolutely unbelievable!! I got all 4 tires changed in 20 minutes and was on my way  to the office with a fresh new look. If you are looking for quality tires for a good price then this is the place to go.<//Review>

Decided to try this place out and never been so impressed in my life!

I needed  tires for my daughters car and was a bit worried at first because  New tires get pricey. Not at In N Out Tires!

I got the best deal ever! Steve took very good care of me, sold me New tires and gave me a free alignment. The Staff was amazing, they got me on my own within 15 minutes.

I Highly recommend this place! (:<//text>

I can't express how much I hate going to a mechanic and feeling like I'm told things are wrong with my car just to get money from me. Here at In and Out tire they understood my situation and fixed all my car problems within two days. Thank you In and Out Tire for great service and experience. I know your my go to mechanic now!< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>2 thumbs up! First of all they are very professional and they answer your question and concerns with honesty. My car needed an allignment so I called to see if they had availability and to inquire about the price. After being told that they were immediately available I was there soon after.  To make it short I was in and out with my car alligned within 1 hour.  Impeccable service! BTW they have a nice seating area with a huge 4k tv and offer complimentary coffee or water! Amazing! They accept cash or card payment.</text>< Pics>

<text>Bad experience here. Went asking for a price on wheels, which they didn't carry. When Steve I believe he's is name. Came in and asked rudely if I was just purchasing one rim. I told him he didn't have to be disrespectful in asking with such a negative tone. I personally don't recommend this place at all.< /text>< gmap_id>

I called ahead of time to check out the prices. They gave me a price and when I took my car in they charged me way more. Be sure to record all your calls if you call them.</review>

(Translated by Google) But I didn't like it because my husband wanted to tip. The worker who did the tire thing and the one who charges said no because if they didn't run it and that's because I asked him his boy's name so that my husband could give the tip

(Original)
Pero no me gustó por que mi esposo quiso dar propina. Al trabajador que hizo lo de la llanta y el que cobra dijo que no porque si no lo corrían y eso por que le pregunté su nombre del muchacho para que me esposo diera la propina<//review>

I came here and Ingrid immediately greeted me. She was very nice and answered all my questions no matter how dumb they were. Not only did she help me renew my registration, she got me a great insurance policy. She worked with my budget and she also helped me with title transfer. She does it all ! I'll be back Ingrid thank you so much< /review>

<Review>I needed it to get a new insurance policy but was SO confused on what to do and where to go. I did all the commercial car insurance websites and all I ended up with was a ton of spam email. Ingrid at Hammer Insurance walked me through each question I had with a detailed answer. She checked out all kinds of insurance companies and found me a rate at least half of what I thought I was going to pay. She called me back and told me she found ANOTHER less expensive policy and I took that. It was so easy and so worth the phone call!!

I have been using Hammer insurance for some time now and I’ve always had great service. I needed to make an upgrade on my policy and was looking to save a little bit of money as well.  I initially called the day before when they were closed. First thing in the morning I received a call back from Claudia Espinoza.
The transaction was quick, pleasant and was completed all over the phone. If you are looking for a place that can make things happen when you need it, call or visit Hammer Insurance. Claudia, and I’m sure all the rest of the staff will be there to take care of your needs in the time you need it in.

Thanks again Claudia for your outstanding service !<//review>

Kastely was amazing! She was very helpful and informative on providing my husband and I insurance. We are both young drivers and she understood how expensive insurance can get so she helped us out a bunch. I recommend going to her, she was very patient with us and answered any questions we had. She also had a great attitude while helping us the entire time 😊< /Review>

<review>Claudia from hammer insurance is the friendliest sales agent I’ve inquired within any insurance company. Very polite always willing to help and is also always willing to have a talk with you about your day to make you feel better! She’s truly a joy of a sales agent and I could see why she has abundant amount of awards. Truly the best of the best!< /review></record></dataset><record>

I've been with different insurance companies but no one made me feel as comfortable and at home as Hammer insurance. Everyone in the office communicates so when you call after dealing with one of their agents they automatically know your name and treat you like family. They look for the lowest rates with the best possible outcome for both you and the insurance company you're working with. I would recommend this company to anyone anywhere in any state. Hammer insurance is Top Shelf.....< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The best insurance company there is ! Hands down ! With the best representative by the name of Jennifer ! She’s the best ! She help me get the cheapest full coverage I could find despite my not so best driving record and on top of that I got a very very very reasonable down payment to start it all. So truly indeed if your looking for top flight insurance come here and ask for Jennifer<//Review>

Not only that. she went out of her way to  help me with some dmv issues i had. if you are looking to get insurance or maybe even interested in seeing if you can save a few bucks on another policy,  id definitely recommend claudia.</review><gmap_id>0x80c3548ed1f5c37f:0x5f37bc3444b0da1<//gmap_id></record>

Hammer Insurance was an good and fast Experience they were very fast answering the phone in an  professional  matter. I was greeted by an customers service agent by the name of  Kastely, she was very helpful and patient with me answering all my questions and demands how I wanted my insurance will be, So far I will recommend to other.</Review>

WOW!!  Well today i came in and immediately i was attended by Claudia Espinoza. I was quickly seated at her desk. After my info was taken down she quickly found an affordable insurance despite my tickets and my driving record! I really appreciate the effort she put into helping me. The rest of the staff was also very friendly and even assisted in finding a policy for me! I'm proud to say that I'm insured through hammer insurance. I recommend you call or come in and get help from any of the professionally trained staff. If i could I'd give 10 stars out of 5.< /Review>

<text>I have had GREAT experience with Hammer insurance. We have been with Hammer insurance for over 2 years and we love. Albert is excellent at his job. I recommend Albert to anyone who is interested in looking for car insurance he goes beyond your expectations and always finds  the best rates. He has helped my family in many different ways such as canceling a policy, finding a better rate and much more. When something incorrect came up in the driver record he disputed with the insurance to get it taken off.</text>< user>

I want to thank Claudia Espinoza for giving me such a better plan, I’m literally saving myself just about $75 monthly now. All I did was try to make a payment and she went above and beyond to getting me a lower one with much more benefits. Thank you Claudia.</Review>

I came into Hammer to find some insurance for my new vehicle. Susana was beyond courteous and provided me with all the answers I was seeking. Susana explained to me the differences in the policies and helped me find the most efficient rate. I have recommended that my family and friends to go and see Susana if you are in the market for Insurance.< /Review>

Two Words, One name. CLAUDIA ESPINOZA! The only reason why I still use Hammer Insurance is because of this lady. In fact I've been using Hammer since 2010! And Claudia has been like a personal assistant for me! I just call in and shes all about service. Sometimes when I call and she's not there (rarely) I just say ill call back later. She is someone I wish I had in other places dealing with my money and protection. I own my own businesses and she is a great example for me to tell my employees of how to give great customer service. Thank you Hammer for this person.< /Text>

Came in to Hammer Insurance and was greeted as soon as I walked in. The service was great and got exactly the coverage I needed. Chelsea Lehr was very helpful and professional. It was a smooth process and she did everything she could to save me money. I would recommend this office to everyone for their insurance needs.< /review>

<review>Very friendly great place of business. The only down side I experienced was waiting while I was already being helped for the representative to take a phone call after we already started with what I need d help with. Then she forgot to put information on some forms that needed to be sent to my finance company.< /review><rate>4<//rate><user_id>115307233826200758916</user_id>< response>

<Text>Chelsea Lehr is a wonderful insurance agent. She was very helpful, answered all my questions and was extremely friendly. She made it incredibly easy to get my insurance switched over, she went over my policy in depth, offered alternatives and services that could definitely come in handy in strenuous circumstances. I will definitely stay with hammer with her as my insurance broker.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Hammer insurance was able to insure my vehicle with a reasonable monthly payment and provided helpful customer service. Chelsea was very patient with me being indisicive and very skeptical about this insurance at first. Hopefully this insurance comes in handy when I really need it.</text>

Yvette was quick and courteous.. interacts well with her customers...for the exception that she didn't ask what I wanted my deductable to be. Nor what we were covered for..until I asked..didnt explain clearly on what customer was expected to do..assumption is the lowest form of communication..👌< /review>

<Text>I can honestly say hands down the best insurance company ever ! They are super friendly and very attentive. I’ve had the honor of speaking and working with the manager of the office and she’s the best representative of great customer service! Vanessa really makes you feel at home and feel like you joined their family. It’s to the point where I recommended my family to get Hamner insurance and I will definetly recommend you all to be apart of the Hamner insurance family ! 5 out 5 !!< /Text><Date>1533678610805< /Date><user_name>Xavier Echeverria< /user_name><rate>5< /rate>< gmapID>

Edit 10/30/2018
5 star to 1 star
Because of the agent's(jennifer) mistake I have to pay an extra 188$ to the insurance company. She gave me a new insurance policy saying the old insurance policy is cancelled but later I found out that both are active and ended up paying premiums for both of them. She told me 3 weeks back that she will give me callback regarding this but never heard from her till now. These people don't stand on their word. very bad service. time to call GEICO.

==========================
The people here are very good and welcoming. We were here to get our car insured and Susan Rubio helped us to get the best price. Thank you guys.< /text>
