I wanted to give a shout out to Jordan, who towed my daughter’s vehicle this past week. My daughter’s car was parked on a tiny mountain road crowded with other cars and houses within cm’s of the road. The car was parked on a ledge leading down to a river and on a slight curve. Moreover, the steering wheel was locked, so Jordan had no way of turning the wheels to get the angle he needed. He did an amazing job of maneuvering to get the car in the right position to get it onto the truck. We were amazed! Thanks for not giving up!<//text>

Cops call and they come and follow orders whether it is legal or not or whether it is morally ethic or not. These guy are operating without any consciousness and are thus far not even capable of thinking for themselves.
You guys want a good review. How bout you start telling the cops no and telling your paying customers that you have their backs</Review><Gmap_id>0x808e351d47896339:0x799bb933c3da71de< /Gmap_id></record>

The first driver was very rude and unprofessional (mike), we had to call the manager to send another driver, and he was very polite and helped to tow the car to the mechanic shop. If you see Mike's name as a driver, cancel the ride or call to make sure you’ll get a different driver.<//review>

I have gotten some great cars here. But be careful. They will pull some shady moves if you don't pay attention. Be sure not to take there word and only accept information backed by proof. If they say the tags are good. Don't believe until you see the registration. Or you might get pulled over leaving there yard and get harassed about stolen tags. True story.< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>This was the worst nightmare ever, after waiting almost 3 hours for a simple battery jump the driver was incompetent and not helpful, he seemed to be more worried about how I was going to pay if I needed a battery than really trying to get my car started.  I am really upset that AAA uses such a poor company to contract with.  I am not able to walk far and felt abandoned and alone on a dark street without any updates for over an hour and a half after the original time frame given for service.  I would never recommend this company for any service.  If you call AAA for service, make sure it is not Dick's automotive.<//review>< Pics>

It didn’t happen to me but my sisters car broke down and Sergio handled the situation 100/100. The way my sister described it it was like he was a gps system himself. Knew street by street where she was and where she was trying to go. He said he would be there in 25 minutes and he was there in 24. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, that is in this line of work that services people in distress should be trained just like this man. Thank you Sergio for assisting my sister.< /Text>

This was a great experience I had Mario come and service me and he was able to help jump my car instead of towing it. I’m glad he was of good assistance and helpful in recommending a tire shop close by with deals. Glad to have him come out and help me even though I was running late to the location

<rate>5</rate><review>Mario Aguayo, your towing technician was fabulous.  We called triple AAA and we are so happy they assigned you to our time of need. Our car literally shut down at a stop sign this morning. Within 10 minutes Dick's Automotive was there.  Mario was one of the most helpful, professional tow truck drivers I have ever met.  He went the extra mile and figured out that the alternator needed to be replaced. We handed him our keys to the car knowing it was in safe hands and he towed it to the place of repair.  What a pleasure to work with such a nice person during a stressful time.  We know Dick's has been around many years as Dick and I did business together years ago.  Now his sons run the shop and it is so nice to see a great group of people are still giving that special above and beyond customer service.

Excellent & Fast Service. Saturday afternoon my COSTCO BFGoodrich tire came apart on the San Thomas Expressway. AAA sent Dick's Automotive Transport (City of Campbell), driver Colin, and a flatbed tow truck. CHP arrived and provided Traffic Control Safety. Colin is very helpful, offered me drinking water, and let me use his smart phone to find a local tire shop, Calderon Tires, and away we went. I definitely recommend Dick's Automotive Transport and their great Customer Service. Special thanks to driver Colin. Thumbs way UP!</Review>

They are the AAA  contractor in my area. They were unable to solve a problem they caused, so left and also refused to tow my car, even though I am a paid AAA member. Had to call AAA and beg for another tow  service. 0 stars<//text>

<text>I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!
I ORDERED THE CHICKEN NACHOS AND I LITERALLY NO I DID GET BOILED SHREDDED CHICKEN WITH NO FLAVOR PLAIN AS ALL!  IT WAS SMOTHERED OVER SOME PLAIN BEANS AND OLD BROWN CHUNKS OF AVOCADO! OOH AND I DID I MENTION THAT THEY HAD A PICTURE OF WHAT MY NACHOS WERE SUPPOSE TO LOOK LIKE THE CHICKEN WAS GRILLED CUT INTO SLICES.. MINE WAS BOILED SHREDDED !!!PLAIN!!!. CHIPS WERE STAIL CHEESE TASTED A LIL TO MUSTY!!!
MY HUSBAND ORDERED A BURRITO AND IT WAS FILLED WITH WHO KNOWS WHAT BECAUSE WHEN WE RECEIVED IT IT WAS FILLED. WITH RICE AND BEANS RAW ONIONS LOADED WITH CILANTRO YUK AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS SLIMY AND NOT SATISFYING( IT WASNT SALSA)  Plus THE MEAT INSIDE WAS HARD AS A ROCK AND THEN ODDLY ENOUGH SOME PIECES OF MEAT WERE PINK! NO WE DIDNT FINISH OUR MEAL AND MADE A COMPLAINT TO GRUB HUB!  ALSO THE OWNER OF THIS RESTAURANT SHOULD BE TASTING THESE DISHES AND NOT BE POSTING FAKE PICTURES OF WHAT THESE DISHES LOOK LIKE!! ALSO OUR GRUBHUB DRIVER YORDAN WAS VERY RUDE!< /text><time>1616221674195<//time><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>I can't say enough amazing things about this restaurant. My wife and I have had just about everything on their menu and Poncho's out do themselves on every order. There are no bad dishes at Poncho's. In my opinion this is the best Mexican restaurant in the valley hands down, especially their breakfast burrito! Keep it up Poncho's!<//review>< Pics>

<review>It’s a typical hole in the wall Mexican spot with amazing food. Street tacos with rice was perfect! Everything i wanted and more.

Benches in the place are torn up and need to be replaced but i know what to expect when i come to places like this. Definitely will be coming back many more times.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Good food but horrible service. We decided to give them a second chance after delivering food took them two hours. This time they almost took three hours. Called them to inquire about food they claimed that driver was minutes away...food arrived late again. This guys are minutes away we could have driven there to pick it up instead of waiting again. Be aware that their delivery is the worse.< /Review><user_name>oscar olivares< /user_name><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Best eats on Grubhub. Freshest meats and best sauces. Best enjoyed in the restaurant so you don't wait 3 hours for an order.< /text>

Poncho's has a nice extensive menu offering excellent Mexican food..both lunch/dinner and breakfast all day. The ingredients are good quality and fresh. Their salsa is made in house and is reason enough to come here and eat. Delicious Carne Asada and fresh, good tacos de pollo among many other items.

Thankfully, Poncho's has gone through some much needed renovation since my last visit: gone are torn, worn booths and some windows with bullet holes..in are decent tables with chairs. The walls have new paint. The place looks cleaner.

The girl who works the counter, brings out food and cleans is friendly, hard working and just plain excellent.

While not a fine dining establishment, if you're looking for good solid Mexican food (and beyond delicious salsa) it's a great place to come. BTW.. Parking is easier in the street than the tiny lot.< /Text>

Great home style flavor of cooking, and I emphasis flavor. Odd to eat in, torn bench seating, dirty, and only 1 waitress/cashier/busser. Will return for to go or delivery orders.<//Text>

< Review>
I have been looking for a good Mexican Restaurant since returning to the San Fernando Valley in August. I have not been pleased with any of the places where I shopped over a year ago.
I used to have food from Poncho's delivered. But today I went there in person to get my tacos on National Taco Day. The counter person did not know this and had no clue there was even such a thing!! She claimed the salsa was very hot and spicy, and it was!
I ordered the three hard shell tacos combo. I was very disappointed that ground beef meat was not an option. Neither was shredded beef. So, I had 'steak' tacos. (Carne Asada) The tacos we're just OK, as I had asked for extra tomatoes. Mostly the steak was not too tough, And my dog got the tough, stringy pieces. Rice and beans were acceptable. I will continue my search for the 'perfect' hard shell tacos! I am muched grieved over the loss of Casa de Carlos, where I always had a great taco!!</Review>

I am new to the valley. I searched many places to get the best pozole and this place by far the best. The only problem is parking and the wait is extremely long. But it’s worth it once you get your pozole.<//review>

<Text>I had a hearty order of Huevos Rancheros, with three tortillas on the side. (I hope I offended no one by using them to make soft tacos of my meal.)
Coffee was good, and the company pleasant. Service was good, and they made sure I had enough coffee.
I would eat here again, but most a place for a romantic date.</Text>< Response>

Great "little hole in the wall". This place has amazing food. Always fresh, always delish, and true authentic Mexifare. Yes, their delivery serv. could be improved but they just launched it and are acclimating to the demand. Want great food, you gotta wait. They get super busy.</review>

I walked in and the cook was the only person here, she said the cashier was late and she was unable to charge me. my food was waiting on the counter for about 20 minutes and i was just sitting here waiting for the cashier to show up so i could be charged and be on my way.. not a good look for the place and the management.</review>

The people are nice and the food is good I recommend the asada nachos and chicken flautas are delicious. I really don't come here as often because I can never find parking.< /review>

Small gym, lots I mean lots of people, the equipment is literally crammed in. They have 3 sets of stairs and only 1 works. It’s been over a month and they have not fixed these machines. I’d recommend looking for a different gym unless you like racing people to use certain equipment!< /text>

<Text>My work schedule recently changed and I go to the gym right after I get off but it’s so frustrating because it’s always at capacity and you have to wait a little. I used to love coming to this gym but now it’s a hassle. Probably going to have to just cancel membership till my work schedule changes again or the gym expands.. hopefully the latter because I know a lot of other people are also affected by the small capacity.< /Text>< Rating>

The gym is clean with a friendly, professional staff.  Parking is excellent compared to most gyms.  Equipment is clean and well maintained.  It's very easy to recommend the gym to anyone.   Nice mix of young and older clients who all seem to be having a good time.  Grady, the manager, gets a lot of credit for the atmosphere.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>It's decently equiped. It can get a little busy it seems but it also doesn't stay that way long. They check your temp at sign in, recommend masks while working out ( and as far as my time there everyone does),  sanitizer and paper towels to clean equipment before and after using( and every one does), staff members also cleaning . No locker rooms ( they have 2 changing rooms, and lockers along the walls). The price is great! I mean really really great!  Staff is friendly , and remember your name! Can say anything bad about this place .<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Rating it for what it is. Cheap, generally clean, friendly staff, etc. It can get a little bit too busy to do much sometimes, due to the relatively small space, but they can't really do much about that, given the location. Not so much a strike against the staff as merely something to bear in mind. The remodel has been a welcome change and influenced my return here as a member. Simple, cheap, and well laid out, with some downsides related to a relatively small space. Overall would recommend.<//text><name>Aaron Dilts< /name><rate>4</rate><UserId.>109575566834028966462</UserId.>< GmapID>

<rate>3< /rate><Text>There are pros and cons for this gym. I have a membership for three years for around $9 per month, so it isn't a bad price. This also includes another person coming with me for free every time, and there are no other fees that I need to pay. It was also easy for me to signup and I could pay the entire amount up-front, unlike similarly priced gyms.

Along with the pros above, there are cons: this place tends to lack cleaning supplies, so I've had to begin bringing my own with me every time now. The bathrooms are also filthy, but I've just come to accept that it's a common occurrence at most gyms nowadays--especially in California. Half the time, nobody is at the front desk, so people sneak in a lot. I've seen it happen three times already, and was stunned that they weren't seen. It also can sometimes be extremely hot and stuffy downstairs, so it'd be nice if they invested in some large, industrial fans for the rooms. One last thing that may not matter to others as much as it does to me: this place closes way too early and opens way too late on weekends. I like to get my workouts done throughout the week and the weekends, and I'm usually working late on studies into the night. I wish they opened at 5 A.M. on weekends like they do during the weekdays.</Text>< pics>

Don't go here or at least don't purchase training sessions. Paid 300$ to get a personal trainer and all they did was cancel on me. And now they're dragging their feet In giving me back my refund. The manager Grady is the biggest joke.</Review>

I really enjoy this gym and most of its staff. It's my teams go to gym. However, I had some billing issues and questions that took over 3 months to fix. Some associates passed me along to others because of little knowledge. Finally when I spoke with the manager I took his attitude personal. I felt like I was being spoken to in a condescending manner along with not really caring about the situation. He made me feel like the issue was my fault. Fortunately I'll continue to attend this gym but I'll be sure to steer clear of the manager.< /Text>

< review>
The gym is cool but I had a negative experience today at 9:00 am at the Zumba's class.
I got into the room just to watch the class because I was curious about the dance class, more than curious I really had the intention in do that and see if I will be able to fallow the class. At that moment... when I got into the room the teacher stopped the class  and told me to leave. She was very rude, completely unpolite and unprofessional with me.

For this reason I don’t want to do this class anymore and I will keep on with my basic plan!</review>

<Text>Pros:
1) Price seems fair for what this gym offers

Cons:
1) Employees are rude, they will call/text you incessantly with marketing and payment requests.
2) Cancelling is a hassle and they'll keep texting you trying to get you to come back for months.

I would not recommend this gym to a friend.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Worst customer service. I keep getting told that there is no upper management to complain to.. But there is!! If I didn't just pay an annual fee 3 months in I would cancel.< /Review>

They do not explain anything about your membership. once you sign up they will just take money from you and does not explain anything else.  And when you cancel it, be surprised on what kind of ridiculous charges you'll get. I was informed that I can cancel my membership any time "no problem" but guess what, they're giving me problems right now. They will and trust me they will charge you for something that you wont be using. They charge me and took my membership ID.  Hate this place!!!</Text></record>

My school had our prom at this venue and it was very elegant and big. It had stairs and an elevator. A big ballroom floor, rooms off to the side, it had an area for dining and taking a break. However I feel as though they should put more bathroom stalls in for the bathrooms because there were only 2 and we had over 300 prom goers. The bathroom was spacious though for the girls... Idk about the guys obviously. But an overall 4/5 because I really enjoyed myself.< /review>

Thankyou Phil and staff there. Glad I found this venue. If you are planning your wedding with the help of family this is the place to go. Very affordable and all the family came together too make my day amazing you do not need license bar tenders or caterers, bring it all yourself. I love this venue very spacious and upscale defiantly a classy place for the right budget I definitely recommend Masonic temple for any celebration</review>

<review>Been here a second time, the venue is nice. Be careful with restoring the room to the original condition. The temple is nice, but they took a $150 deposit away because it was not returned to the original condition, hence, not clean. I made a walk through around the temple and it was almost the same as the way I left it in. There was some candle wax on a single piece of table cloth and some chairs were slightly out of place. They claimed that the damage and cleaning will cost $150 since the table cloth had candle wax and it was not clean when I left.There is no way all of that costs $150.<//review></record>

My husband and I decided to stop by O Sole Mio for dinner before we made our way to the airport for our flight back home. Being big fans of Italian food, we were excited for our experience after reading the reviews. The food was AMAZING. It you’re looking for a cozy nook with authentic Italian cuisine, this is the place to go! Both our meals were delicious, our waitress was very friendly, and the whole place welcomed you in with open arms. If we ever find ourselves back in the San Francisco area, we’ll be sure to stop in again!<//Text>

Great atmosphere, friendly and attentive service, and of course, delicious Italian food.

They bring out crispy and warm sourdough bread, which you can dip in the traditional olive oil and balsamic at your table. The house salad was fresh and visually pleasing with all the vibrant colors. As for the chicken marsala, I actually expected more portions, but it was good nevertheless. The bill came with a little Andes mint chocolate piece. I left very full and satisfied.<//Text><rate>5< /rate></record>

Authentic. Delicious. Italian. This is a place for family meals with a lovely owner and a great atmosphere. They have some of the best takeout packaging I've seen this pandemic. Do yourself a favor and enjoy some Italian classics here. You won't be disappointed.</Text>

Great food and great services. I never know it's this good. Should have try earlier. Everything from the complimentary bread to the entree is excellent. Everything is fresh and hot, burn your mouth hot. I would definitely come back and try other menu items.<//Text>

It's ok.  Listened to a woman on speaker phone for several minutes.... friend speaking of bank complaints.  Politely challenged her.  She shut it down.  Good.   Got no encouragement or appreciation from waiters.  Am I wrong?
Dont understand $4 upcharge for anchovies in a caesar salad. Clam in wine sauce not rich enough</Text>

Surprisingly good place. Had the linguine with fresh clams, and they were great. The clams were fresh; the pasta was previously dry (didn't have the same bounce as freshly made pasta). The atmosphere was warm and inviting. We were there when the accordion player and singer was there (Michael?) And he was very entertaining.< /text>

Pretty good service here. The food is good and it comes quick. The only downside of my visit is that my Hot Chocolate was a little cold when it came. Otherwise, everything else was good.< /Review>

Chicken pesto pizza was amazing... especially the crust.

Also ordered plain pasta which was equally satisfying.

10/10 would recommend!</Text>

<Review>Absolutely great service and an overall great place to eat. I absolutely loved their garlic bread, and Cesar salad. And I would love to come back and try some of their speciality pasta, gnocchi dishes, and pizza.

<review>A storied Italian gem that's popular with the locals. Their pasta is to die for and if you can eat it in house you'll be served by the nicest people. The decor is something out of an Italian stereotype, but it has its charms.

I really enjoy their sizable dessert menu. It helps nail in the whole experience with a satisfying sugary finish.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7igno9KgUygh6jtY8AuoJNrl632T70fGKTaEr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Great little Italian Restaurant that feels very old school! Amazing service with very reasonable prices! I had an incredible lasagna for dinner that completely filled me up and it was only $14! Great value for a wonderful home cooked meal!< /Review>

During the COVID 19 pandemic John and staff are super nice. I ordered the food by phone and it was ready for pick up in 25 minutes. Of course we would love to dine in, but when you place their food on your own china and silverware, it is still really good. The food is perfectly cooked, portion sizes are generous and you feel completely satisfied. Thank for running and operating such a great family style country Italian restaurant!<//Review>

I absolutely love coming here with my grandma. We always enjoy the homemade, hearty minestrone with fresh grated Parmesan. Althea and Luna are always so courteous and take great care of us. Mario and John are great hosts and are like watching a sitcom.....so funny! This place is great; anyone who says otherwise is nuts!</Review>

<text>Beautiful atmosphere, I loved the decorations, and the way they designed the interior makes it feel cozy without feeling cramped.

The food was excellent, the garlic bread is a must order! They also serve large salads for the whole table to share, something I haven't seen in a long time.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>Let me start by saying, O solo Mio is one of those neighborhood restaurants that's been around for years. It's cute and, quaint at the same time. The food is really not that special. It's something that you could make it home, if you have the time. I paid over a hundred plus dollars, not including tip.
Keep in mind, it was only myself and two teenage girls. It's been said, you get what you pay for. Not in this case. You pay more for what you get. The quality of the food could be a great deal better. The staff is always friendly ,polite ,and courteous.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><username>Michael Cato</username>< Resp>

Filled with 1950s era pictures lining the walls and not many places make their ceiling presentable, sky blue with grape vines found all around. I like that stuff and the chocolate mints with the check was the icing on the cake.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ3WIbuyumd6lxmFhVGjAQulqwgV1uhGstd7Pi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

This pizza was on their menu and the only thing we added was sausage and salami.  Instead of making this right, management pretty much blamed me for ordering their pizza.  What a cheap and horrible way to be treated.  Never have the veggies on a pizza made the crust wet right out of the oven.  What was this manager thinking?? We will NEVER RETURN.< /Review>< pics>

Made a last minute reservation for a group of 7 and they had a table ready for us with waters and menus. They took a little while to come take our drink orders but after that it was a great experience! Fast water refills and clearing plates away quickly. All of us really enjoyed our food and desserts as well. I wouldn’t recommend this place if you’re in a hurry but otherwise I plan on coming back again.<//review>

One of the best old school Italian family style restraunts I've ever been to in the bay. Atmosphere is fun, warm, and cozy, with vintage decor mixed in with classic Italian touches. Plaid tablecloths, crystal candle holders, and hanging grapevines set the mood. Then the friendliest staff brings a basket of warm fresh baked bread, soft and chewy- with butter, or olive oil and balsamic.
There's a large menu with all the classics- calamari, salads, pasta specialties, seafood, pizza. Even a dessert menu, as well as beer and wine. I had the linguine with salmon and shrimp, it did not disappoint, the pasta was great. We also had a pizza, and the chewy crust is on the thinner side with a nice puffy crust on the edge. Sauces are flavorful and fresh tasting, and portions are grand. I have to come back for more. We even walked in to a singer on the accordion on a Sunday eve. Service is very friendly and attentive.< /Review>

Had been there about a year ago, and frankly had no strong recollection, good or bad. So this week we were looking for a nearby Italian Restaurant and decided to try O Sole Mio again. It was a mild disappointment.

The restaurant is spread across two store fronts, making it a bit bigger than it seems when first looking in. There's a quirky charm about it. Slightly over the top. Jukeboxes at every table contrast with Italy-inspired decor. The ambiance is not fabulous, but for a low-key neighborhood restaurant it's cute.

The service is the other positive aspect. They are friendly and attentive.

But the food just wasn't good. My pizza was tasteless. The dough was like cardboard and there was hardly any sauce on it, though strangely the toppings were plentiful. My wife's  eggplant parmigiana was also bland. In retrospect we wished we had cooked at home.

I feel for local businesses that have to absorb ever higher cost for rent and labor, and whose ability to pass these increases on to customers is limited. But to me, an Italian restaurant lives and dies by the quality of its food. And a great, flavorful tomato sauce really does not cost that much to make.< /Review>

Great food and service, always busy but I never wait for a table.  Some italian places only offer a small menu filled with "exotic' combinations...if you're looking for classical Italian (e.g. pasta, parmigian, etc.) and lots of options, this is your place!< /review>

What a hidden gem. John, the owner is a wonderful host and takes great pride in his restorante!  This place is right out of tuscany and the food was great. Prices, were much less than I was expecting after being in the city all week. You don't have to donate a kidney to afford a glass of wine here. Enjoy folks, great spot and enjoy the Italian music whilst dining.</Review>

<review>Had a to-go order. Got 2 different things. Both were bland, had very simple ingredients, and were not tasty at all. For the price we paid, this is just not worth going here. Unless they significantly improve their menu and use ingredients that don’t cost 2 dollars, we won’t be coming back.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Rating>2< /Rating><userid>112265679237111312612< /userid>< Date>

We left the Bay Area. Restaurant moved to Millbrae unbeknownst to me until I wandered across it's new home on Google Maps. Several dinners there coming from Nevada with lasagna on my mind have not been disappointing. Though it's a long drive/ ride, for dinner John and staff are worth the trip.<//text>< time>

<text>The pizzas are delicious. So good. You eat one and remember how delicious it was for days afterward. Specifically my group had the meatball pizza pie and o sole mio pizza pie. O Sole Mio also does doordash for when you want Italian, but are feeling too lazy to leave home. :) 10/10 will be back!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Time>

< Review>
Excellent food and service for a decent price.

Good: food, service, portions
Bad: a little slow, only standard veg Italian options

Service:
Initial drop off of water/bread was inattentive, both for us and for a table next to us. Simply dropped off the items and walked away. The lady at the table next to us wanted to ask a question, but the man dropping off the water just turned his back and walked away. One of the servers had no idea which table was which, and our waitress was shaking her head in amusement as he wandered from table to table trying to deliver a salad to its owner.

Our waitress, however, was quite good. Friendly, attentive, and perhaps extra generous with the wine; 1/2 litre ordered, supposedly 3 glasses worth in it... easily 4+ glasses out of it, though. Didn't catch her name, otherwise I'd toss it up here so people know who to look for.

Food:
My mom ordered prawns with spaghetti and was generally pleased, except for wanted more/bigger prawns. My dad ordered lasagna and, while he was originally wondering why they would include ham inside it, he was also generally pleased. His only complaint was that there was too much cheese; I think specifically too much ricotta inside. I ordered linguini alla marinara and thought it was excellent. Very simple, very tasty. The house pinot grigio was fairly crisp and delightful as well.

My only complaint, and this is a general one with Italian restaurants, is the number of available vegetarian options. This restaurant was a tad worse because there weren't any veg ravioli options; most restaurants I've been to have at least one. I'd really like to see a novel vegetarian Italian option one of these days.

Atmosphere:
Very simple, nice environment; could work for a quiet, romantic night out. Nothing special, but no overly negative characteristics either.< /Review>

The fun of discovering a "find" can only be experienced, not described. Kids and adults alike will find something to enjoy at one of the three book sale rooms. My daughter looks forward to going there and plans how she is going to spend her allowance on the books. I feel it has contributed to improving the variety in her reading.</Review>< UserId.>

Probably the best used book sale (and used book store) in the area! I have their monthly sales on my calendar. Well-organized book sale in a large (air conditioned) building with books sorted/shelved by topic / genre. Prices are very low / reasonable.<//Review>

I like spending time here browsing and reading.
The new, well thought-out environmentally friendly building provides pleasant atmosphere and reading areas.
The catalogue isn't as expansive as Mountain View library, for example,  but still decent.<//review>

Ok I really like what they do and I have always been donating and buying. However if you are standing inside with your arms full of books at 3:30 pm (open2-4) and they tell you to go and return Monday, then that is it! I will have to find somewhere else where the donation is appreciated< /text>

You can buy books at the Middlefield Monthly sales or at the Library stores. I especially like the Middlefield Monthly Sales, held on the second Saturday, Sunday and Monday of each month - and books I saw were almost all between 25-50 cents in paper, and $1-3 hardbound . On the first day, Saturday, there is the biggest selection, on the second day. Sunday, prices go down as low as $5 a bag, later in the day. On the third day, Monday, after 6pm, in the Bargain Room, ALL BOOKS ARE FREE, ON MONDAYS ONCE A MONTH - the second Monday of the month in the Bargain Room. There are thousands of books. It's an advantage of living in a well-to-do district - people can afford to make lots of donations, and there are fewer people shopping for them. I found the all-volunteer staff to be wonderfully helpful and friendly. And buying here is for a good cause, it supports the Palo Alto Public Library.< /Text>

<Review>Great venue to get good quality books at a very cheap price. They hold a big sale once a month and the remaining books that are not sold during the weekend are offered for free the next Monday after the sale.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Considering that their books are just donated, they have the most expensive selling price of used books. Senior volunteers are not friendly.  They act as if they own the bookstore, very impolite, and very "racist"!  You might want to think twice before you support them.  There are plenty of Friends of the Library organization and I have not seen one as worse as this one.<//text>< Pictures>

Donations are easy, just drop them off at the main book sale area in the back.</review>

This place is awesome, and we had a great experience on our 2 hour visit.  We bowled, each lane has modern computer scoring, and enjoyed their extensive beer  menu (they have a full bar, staffed by an excellent bartender).  The whole place is very clean and well kept with reasonable prices ($15 an hour or $2.50 per person per game).  There is also an attached taco place that we didn't try.  If we are ever again in the area, I'm sure we'll be back.<//review>

<text>Bowling, Bar and Chow (Get Some)!

Bowling - All the gear you need at low prices.
Chow - Street taco joint  with good food also at low prices.
Bar - Sports bar with many TVs (one is 90"), again with low prices ($1.50 frosty  12oz mugs of beer during happy hours Mon-Sat 3-6).< /text>< user_id>

Fun location with 16 lanes. They have a full bar that has pool tables and an onsite Mexican food place. I believe they also have karaoke some nights.< /text>

<Review>Everyone at Bowladium Bowling Alley and in the bar have always been superior with their work ethic and hospitality.  Mexican Street Taco's is now open in their new location where Louisiana Fried Chicken used to be.  Patrons can order and eat their food inside the bar if they are 21 or older and children are welcome inside the restaurant and bowling alley.</Review></record>

At last one of 29 Palms crown jeweles has come out to shine!  The 29 Palms Street Tacos restaurant puts out amazing food.  It's a great way to begin or end a family night,  and bowling fits the fun family and friends gathering.</Review>

I believe its the owner of the bar, he makes the best drinks, and reasonably priced. Bowling ally was modern, had shoes in good condition, and a wide variety of bowling balls to use, had a great time overall<//review>

< Review>
I thought the presentation was great but the food was not as flavorful and delicious. The chicken liver mousse and the crab spaghettini were decent but other dishes were misses for me.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Truly excellent and innovative seafood

The Nori Spaghettini and the seafood charcuterie (especially the preserved octopus) were outstanding. The English muffins really are crazy good. - should have gotten seconds for desert. Still a bit of work to do on operations/seating but will absolutely go back.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxomUArN0kQztVx8QpTeL5pYzSd7xH9v6ZQjYN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1TeVvWDSfkT4Nb-7b5DaAMa7aINMkIzfIyBwT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Surprising delicious seafood place in union square area. Shocked it wasn’t more crowded. Great martini and crab pasta< /text>

Food was extremely disappointing given the reviews. The seafood platter was minuscule and meh at best. The chippoino was one of the worst I ever had. The artichoke came dried with the inedible skin with almost no centre. The only redeeming part of dinner was the wine. Which thankfully was made by a talented winemaker and not their woeful kitchen. But they had to spoil it by charging us more for the wine in the bill then it was listed the menu. So us$211 later before tip. We were hungry, annoyed and leaving with an empty pocket.</review><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Great food, I came here looking for something new and refined in the dishes. Guess I founded it here. I came in with a friend and took seating based on my wait time. The host was gracious and escorted us to our seats. Afterwards, I ordered food and the dishes looked amazing.

Best part is the the food tasted clean and no off taste. I can imagine comming back here for a holiday dinner.

The prices were also reasonable as I didn't expect a place like this to charge any less.<//text>

This is a great find!  It's right off Union Square, but only a block away.  Service was great, the food was amazing and not as expensive as you would expect.  I'm really surprised that with drinks, we got away with spending $150.  I had  the split pea ravioli - called essence of spring by the chef - yeah super corny, but delicious!  The other dish was the seafood platter.  That was awesome.  If you ever want a not too strong, but good alcoholic drink, try the French 75.  It's a mix of lemons, something like triple sec and sparkling wine.</review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Went to Ayala as part of a company off-site where they rented out the whole place. We had various small plates, all very good. This is a seafood only restaurant so those with certain dietary restriction may have a harder time. The space itself is quite pretty. Restrooms are in the hotel next door.</text>< Resp>

Food was a solid meh. Expected much more considering the ratings. The only decent thing was the red snapper. I ordered the crab pasta but the crab was tough and the pasta was so sour all I tasted was lemon. I'm pretty sure it was meant to taste like crab.< /Review>

Delicious seafood, very kind wait staff, and a bar seating area so it's possible to get in even without a reservation if there's just one or two of you. Recommended.</review>

Food was good and fresh but it took almost 15 minutes for them to come over and take our drink order.  We ate around 7:30 and it was not even half full and the whole service was slow and frustrating.< /text>

Portions tilted to the smaller end and it was an alright meal. I feel like you can get better in SF for this price point.< /Text>< Pics>

While some dishes are pretty pricey, the food is outstanding, presentation is lovely, and taste combinations are clever and really work (except for the olive oil on the panna cotta). We did 3 shared plates, each better than the one before, and the first was delicious. 1. Salad Louie, 2. Grilled Snap Peas (over olive oil drenched pureed tuna, which tastes way better than it sounds). 3. Nori Spaghettini. Dessert was the Panna Cotta, which was good, not as amazing as what came before. Blueberys Targaryen cocktail was worthy of its name. Great dining experience at a leisurely pace.</review>

A little on the pricey side considering their menu. I would opt for another place. The chairs are also uncomfortable.< /review>

Ok... So, seafood platter and Alaska cocktail. Great start. Uni with shiso, cucumber and yuzu tobiko? Perfect bite (thanks Melissa!).
Nori spaghettini with dungeness crab was fantastic! Baba rhum to finish. Great birthday meal and wonderful introduction to Ayala! Thanks to Melissa, Essam, Jackson & crew.... Folks, y’all need to get in here!<//review>

OUTSTANDING!! These guys made my car look brand new! Dealing with the insurance company was such a hassle but JR and Nate helped me through the entire process. My insurance was trying to force me to go to a different shop because it would be cheaper for them but I wanted to make sure dealer parts would be used to make my car as good as new. These guys helped make that happen! They happily fought for me every step of the way and I’m beyond impressed with the outcome! The work they did is amazing, you’d never be able to tell it had been hit!
I definitely recommend them 100%!< /review>

<text>Needed serious detailing on my Mercedes, due to somehow running over a container of expanding insulation. Their professionalism, attention to detail on what I needed, was great to see. They started working it right on time and had it ready when promised. The car looked fantastic, like new in and out and also the underbody. They worked quickly with my insurance company, leaving me little to do, also great. Highly recommend them if you want it done it right the first time.< /text>< Pictures>

Having grown up in the body & paint industry I am super beyond hard to please!  My dad did paint & body work on a lot of hot rods and roadsters a couple in the Oakland roadster show.  So I definitely know what to look for and 9 times out of 10 can point out where a car has had worked done.   I have had a few bad experiences in town at body shops because i'm girl so i was very apprehensive about getting a quote.  A car parked next to ours ( white ford explorer White platinum met tri coat)  the wind took their door and hit ours, leaving a big dent down to the metal. Jr was amazing very professional and promised me I would not being to see where the dent was.   They did an amazing job and not matter the time of day or lighting you can not see where our door was fixed. I can not say enough good things about Rick's Body & Paint! THANK YOU!!!!</Text>

My insurance company (AAA) referred me to Rick’s Body and Paint to have my vehicle repaired after I was rear ended.  Rick’s took excellent care of me and helped me through the entire process. I never had to think twice about this place. JR and Nate are great to work with, they communicated with me the entire time! They do amazing work! Will recommend to friends and family!< /Text>

This is hands down the best body shop in Vacaville. JR and Nathan were extremely professional and helpful. Everything was explained and the work on my Porsche was outstanding. I would recommend them to anyone looking for excellent work and customer service.< /text>

I was very nervous and anxious after my first ever wreck this past May. I was worried about the idea of losing my factory ordered 2006 Porsche 911.  Needless to say, I was very skeptical about which body shop to trust in looking after my garage queen. After doing some research online, I decided to take my car to Ricks Body and Paint over the few shops that State Farm was trying to send me to. Great decision. I want to thank the guys at Ricks for one, getting my baby back on the road (looking like new!) and two, making my experience painless and efficient. JR and Nate were super helpful and knowledgeable. The paint job was flawless and the car looks better than it did before the accident. They’ve earned a customer and referral source for life.<//Review>

<Review>Amazing customer service from the appointment set up phone call to picking up my car after repairs. Nathan & JR were very helpful and welcoming to work with - they kept me well informed during the whole process and when I'd expect my car to be done and they delivered! Nathan secured a rental for me at the last minute due to a possible safety issue from a collision and ensured the rental process was effortless for me, so grateful for that!

<Text>I brought my dads car here for two claims thus far, JR and Nate did an exceptional job not only taking care of us but on the quality of workmanship offered by them in unmatched. We live over 50 miles away In Vineyard and drove by hundreds of auto body shops to get our vehicle here, no one does a great job like they do here.<//Text>< pics>

I have taken multiple vehicles here, and every time they do an amazing job.  Every time the work is done professionally, and if there is ever the smallest blemish on work they do, they take full responsibility to make sure you get what you want.

I will continue to take all my cars here.

Thanks again.</Review>

JR worked with me from start to finish after my Honda had been rear ended and then pushed into another vehicle. The process was painless and I was even able to just text over some of the photos and information to speed up the process. They also used actual Honda parts which is just a bonus. The customer service, body work, and timing was excellent. I will definitely take my car/future cars there again</text>

Brought in my car for collision damage and everyone was very helpful. Turns out my bumper and fender had to be replaced but they didn't charge me an arm and a leg. Cant even tell it's a new bumper. Very pleased with how it came out. I even brought my other car back for more repairs and of course they did a good job with that<//Review>

I'm always hesitant to give good reviews of places because there's the off-chance that everyone will start going there and it'd be harder for me to schedule an appointment the next time I'm in need of the service.

However... Rick's Auto Body Shop is the truth.

Jr not only helped do a fantastic repair job on my car itself (and even defogged my headlights without asking!), he helped me through the process of dealing with my unruly insurance company and was an absolutely professional in his approach as well as execution.

They treat you so well here, I felt like I was part of the family -- and I truly mean that.

If you need auto body work done -- this is the place.<//text>

I brought my Nissan Altima in for front end repairs and I cannot tell you how happy I am with JR and the rest of the crew at Ricks. Their customer service is amazing and the work they did on my car looks great. They even fixed my hood latch when they found out that there was a recall on it. If I ever need body work done again I'll be going back to them<//text>

They did a great job repairing my wife's car after an accident and also restored my headlights. It didn't even take an hour for them to help me! I work at night so I'm always driving in the dark and it really makes a difference.

As for pricing, I'm not going to anyone else from now on. Highly recommend.</review>

I stopped by the body shop after getting my tires exchanged. I was just driving through CA on my way to MS. I stopped at ricks to get my side skirt fixed. They took a look at it for free and then we're very candid and said I should get my car fixed in Mississippi. They said it would be much cheaper. I was very impressed with their honesty and the integrity they had to send me to another business.</review>

<Text>Honestly speechless to how excellent this business was with ricks body and paint shop. No funny business and very straight forward! The customer service was funny and entertaining, lol great people there. I’m very happy on how everything came out with my car, someone had keyed the side of my car and Ricks made it look like nothing had happened to it before! They were very fast, had my car back within 3 days anddd they did an amazing job at that!  Couldn’t ask for a better body shop :)< /Text>< pictures>

This was my first time using a body shop in town and I couldn't have gone to a better place...They are all wonderful, helpful and friendly!!!
They did a great job on my car and made sure I inspected it and
was happy with it before I left the shop.
They treated me as if I've known them for years...Thank you JR, Rocky, and Rachel!!!! : )</Review>

< Review>
It is with great pleasure that I recommend RIck's Body and Paint to any individual looking for experienced and conscientious staff to handle your automotive repair and paint needs.  I first came to know of Rick's Body and Paint in 2016 when I needed to have the paint redone on my car bumper when my car got sideswiped. I dealt specifically with JR Faquiryan who was always very attentive and responsive to my concerns/questions. I was very satisfied with the paint job in the end.
Unfortunately, in February of this year, I was involved in a 3-car collision and my vehicle suffered extensive front- and back-end damage. I felt comfortable enough to return my vehicle back to Rick's Body and Paint for their help based on my previous experience, and I'm glad that I did so.  JR and the rest of the staff did a great job yet again! JR was great in keeping me updated as much as possible about the repair and I appreciated his frequent contact and back and forth with my insurance company and adjuster.  Although getting my vehicle back took slightly longer than either the staff or myself anticipated, I was willing to wait to ensure my vehicle was just right. My vehicle looked absolutely brand new and ran well! A complete auto detail and promise for a follow-up exterior wax in a few months were also thrown in by JR as further commitment to their great customer service.  The last thing anyone involved in a car accident needs is horrible service for his/her automotive repair.  Thankfully, I experienced absolutely none of that!
Therefore, I would enthusiastically recommend this shop to anyone seeking outstanding and professional staff dedicated to providing their clients with the best customer service and results possible.  You are in good hands with Rick's Body and Paint!<//Review>

< Review>
Rick's Body and Paint in Vaccaville is a 5 star facility due to their customer service and the quality of their repairs. After a hit and run incident I was prospected by a young adult couple in the Walmart parking lot in Rohnert Park asking to fix my car. They told me they were a mobile auto body businesses and after I watched her husband get dents and scratches out of the car I had been trying to get out for years, they told me they had 4 kids. I took their number and told him I would call them about the rest of the work. I also gave them my number and her husband called me relentlessly for weeks telling me he could fix the car for $800 which was much less than my insurance deductible. After about the third phone call I told him I wouldn't let him near my car unless he was going to paint it when he was done fixing it he promised me he would paint the car and repair it for $800 total. I had him come over on a Sunday he was 4 hours late and the sun went down. I asked him not to come to my property, asking how he could repair the car in the dark. He showed up anyways. He brought his wife and father and after they repaired the dents and panel work with Bondo. They told me they needed $100 upfront to go get paint from the auto body shop at this point it was 9:30pm at night and I was skeptical that a paint shop was even open. They came back with grey spray paint from the hardware store and told me it was Primer. They then told me I only have to pay them $600 and I could go to Maaco and have the paint job done for less than $300. I believe them only to discover that Maaco would only paint over the job for another $1000 and I would not have a car for 5 days. This was not an option for me since I am a one-car person and I do not live with my family or have roommates so of course I flipped out. I tried to take it to other shops but everybody told me they would have to dig the workout and not paint over it. The couple blocked my number and refused to take my phone calls. I finally had to turn to JR and Rocky of Rick's Body and Paint to help me access my insurance so I could have rental car coverage while they un did the work. They were friendly and did not judge me because I was conned by obvious drug addicts. I was grateful that they helped me in the pinch and their work was beautiful. I'm so excited to have my car back and feel lucky to have friends in the auto body business. They did not make me feel stupid for being a single women who bought a sob story from losers and not wanting to go through my insurance in the beginning of something that really should have been nipped in the butt. Please remember to take your car to professionals when accidents happen. Do not listen to people who say they can fix your car when they do not work at a shop take it to Rick's you'll be grateful you did!<//Review>

<Review>This place is horrible !!! The employee who is taking the payments by the name of Christian has no shame and should be fired. He literally pocketed the $30 I paid. He first placed the bills under a sheet of paper and then placed it in his left back pocket .. This place is unethical and should have cameras installed!!!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2cb8c06cc14b7:0x5d0fef61e42a5d8f</Gmap_id>< pics>

I had the pork belly Benedict,  their Bourbon, coffee and cream beverage and the donuts with butterscotch. Really flavorful, very friendly staff as well as prompt service! I would definitely return!< /Text>

Excellent place. I live in the senior building next to the restaurant. Food and service is great. Don't let the surrounding area detour you. The people outside are dunks and drug addicts. No reflextion on the great food and great atmosphere</Text>

< review>
I’m not sure what new Oakland we have going on here to have rated this place so highly, my experience was totally different....

My roommate and I hosted a few friends for a small celebration. Because we have a few neighbors who speak highly of this place and it’s reviews he decided to buy their party pack. Online it reads it should serve 3-5 people. We received 8 pieces of chicken, a side salad enough for one maybe two if portioned small, a side of vegetables enough for one maybe two if portioned small and cornbread enough for two. To top it all off, the chicken was more bone than meat.

When I called to ask about what we received the woman who answered the phone told me the meal had been portioned correctly and they’ve sold over “5000 meals that way” and here I am thinking..... he just spent $70 on this. The problem isn’t the money but the portion and the quality both of their product and service. This was poor on all accounts. To make matters worse when he reached out to them on various social media outlets they blocked him rather than address the issue or to explain their service, another poor response. This review was set to be two stars as at least there food was flavorful and cooked well, but for such poor service it’s inexcusable.

When compared to various other eateries in the area I’d say take your money to Gus’, Cater to U, hell even Krispy Kruncy is better than this. For $70 the caliber of what we received should have been top of the line.

Inappropriate on all accounts.</review>

<Text>This would be a hard place to find if it had not been recommended. It is truly wonderful: the friendly staff, the amazing cocktails, and truly terrific food. I would characterize Hopscotch as a bistro. The patrons were truly a mix of all kinds or folks, and the entire place had a great vibe of secret, but unpretentious, destination. My Brussels sprouts, oysters, fried chicken and donuts--yes, donuts for dessert, accompanied by a butterscotch creme for dipping!--all were absolutely wonderful. I'll be to Oakland soon again, and I hate to forego other dining opportunities, but I've got to come back to Hopscotch again. Thanks!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>This is a cute spot. It seems some of the old fashioned coffee shop elements are still in tact. The house special is the fried chicken . It was very good. Actually everything was really good. We had tubs Ap, salad chicken and a beignet with a delish custard dipping sauce. I'd eat here again in a heartbeat</text>< Pics>

< Review>
The chips were still so crispy and well salted. The burger bun was a bit soggy but the meat was cooked well and the lengua was so tender. The donuts were so delicate and the cream was perfect, not too sweet. The maple old fashioned was just the right amount of sweetness, I wish we had ordered more than one order.<//Review>

<text>I did not enjoy eating here. Their sides are awkward how do you serve fried chicken and not have sides like mashed potatoes or mac & cheese ? The service was very cold not a very inviting vibe. Had a side of broccoli and bacon and it was really cold like it came out of the refrigerator I guess that’s how they serve it. It just was nothing special. I honestly could’ve save $25 and ate at McDonald’s and been happier<//text>< Pictures>

The location is conveniently close to the freeway and had plenty of street parking too. We made a reservation so there wasnt a wait.

Great service, food, and drinks. I don't eat oysters so it downed me for a few hours but it looked cool and my dog got to try a bite of the caviar garnish.</text>

<Text>What a charming spot. Sat outside on a sunny day and ate the Kimchi Fried Rice. Staff were friendly and swift amidst the line of people awaiting food.  The couple beside me were having coffees and cocktails and said they were all excellent.< /Text></record></dataset><record>
< review>
This restaurant was very cute, the service hospitable.

I came to have dinner before a show and had to take my entree to go. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it better had I ate it there. I had ordered fish and the entree was all messy by the time I got to it later. It was good though...but I would have preferred the experience the short time I actually was at Hopscotch

There I had the oysters, pickles, and sparkling wine. It was all wonderful. Again I wish I could have enjoyed everything there. I did not want to leave.< /review>

<Review>Came here on a Sunday with my friend for brunch. The place is packed as usual, but fortunately for us there was one table open, so we got it. I ordered the French toast with a side of scrambled eggs. It was delicious and just the right amount of food for me. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict that was equally delicious. Service was good and we left totally full and satisfied! If you haven't been here, now is the time to try. I think you will like it for sure!<//Review><Time>1495535469881< /Time><gmap_id>0x808f80ae5ae98e41:0x77d349a4ec94a7e3<//gmap_id></record>

Cozy and contemporary diner feel to this spot!

Besides the carafe size that was disappointing for 3 people, the food was delicious and service was great!

Scrambled eggs and biscuits was comfort to the soul. Buttermilk chicken is a must get!  Their fried batter was so bomb, lightly crisp and treasurable to the taste buds.  Chicken meat was superbly tender and went well with the sesame dresses salad!  Kimchi fried rice with soft boiled egg was on point.

I loved the fluffy cinnamon donuts at the end with the creamy dip that they provided along with it.  It made it a hop to my step and a smile of pure delight when I was done!</text>

Foods were nice. Salmon is a bit small compared to chicken or burger but it's tasty. Nice cocktails too.< /Text>

Arrived at almost 3PM on a Saturday to a full house. Grab a seat at the bar and was told we can still order brunch item. Also caught the last couple days of Oakland Restaurant Week. The brunch menu for Restaurant Week is a solid deal, 1 donut + coffee or tea (jade green was some really good green tea!), 1 cocktail, and 1 main entree (came in huge portion).
We tried the fried chicken with biscuit and pork sausage gravy (awesome fried chicken, crispy, juicy and flavorful) the kimchi fried rice with shoyu egg (4 halves 😮)

Tip:
1) Get the fried chicken and try with the orange hot sauce
2) Happy hour daily from 3-5PM (see picture for menu)</Review>

A small place that you could miss walking by if it weren't for the line outside of people wanting to come in and eat. Its kind of a confusing place...old school diner feel for Japanese fusion food. Fried chicken was done well. Pork chop was decent but would maybe recommend something else. Whiskey selection was good. Recommend reservations!<//review>

Retro dinner with full bar. The burger was great; big and juicy. The bar highlights Japanese whiskey. Clean and crisp decor. The service was ok, not fast. Not an excellent value.</Text>

Handicap accessible. Beer and wine available. I’d say it’s kid (family) friendly but be prepared to sit very close to next table. One restroom available. They said they are known for the fried chicken. It was really super!  My only complaint is that the chicken served with a side of slaw was $24.00 plus.</text>< Pictures>

Always great food and drink. Menu is not overwhelming, and that's a good thing because they can focus on what they do best. Staff is friendly, and somehow coping with the constraints of the times!</Text>

I take my family to this great spot quite often! This is my favorite restaurant to grab a bite.  I go there regularly. The cooking is just great, the crew is welcoming and the prices are fair. I enjoy going in this restaurant over a good meal.<//review>

<response>{'time': 1522813694166, 'text': "Hi Matt,\nI rarely reply individually, but I wanted to personally apologize for your experience on Easter Sunday Brunch.  As you can imagine, it is one of our busiest brunches of the year.  Unfortunately one of our team members had a death in the family and I had to jump in at the last moment to bartend for the day.  I'm a seasoned bartender, but as the owner, I don't spend much time slinging drinks anymore, so my ticket times were slow.  And I was unable to be on the floor supporting the staff amidst the rush. The dessert cocktail you ordered is one I haven't made in a while and it definitely took too long. I am so sorry. Generally we are known for our congeniality, but I think the day had been really waring on us all at that point.  I'm sorry that you bore the results.  If you give us another chance, please let me know you are coming in so I can try to make it up to you.\nSincerely,\nJenny Schwarz\nOwner, Hopscotch\njenny@hopscotchoakland.com"}<//response>< user>

Very overpriced (pork ragu was 24, doughnuts were 10) but the food was solid. Nothing mind blowing, but the depth of flavor was very well done. I recommend getting the ragu with a little hot sauce, as that breaks up the flavor of the ragu a bit more.</text>

<review>Really enjoyed this restaurant - good food and a lovely setting in Oakland. The oysters with salmon roe and cawaki were choice. As the name suggests, an eclectic range of beers and whiskies too.

I didn’t have a cocktail but my friends did and they all enjoyed them. The Norteño comes to mind as a particularly good one with green pepper vodka (perhaps from St. George’s?). Nice selection of wine that is reasonably priced. As for the food, Restaurant Week for our group size was a set menu, family style.

A few key items: started off with a kale salad (👍🏽), Kakiage - tempura veggie/bamboo shoots which was great, and burrata with squash (best of the bunch).

For the mains, the spatzel with brats was fine but nothing unique about it. Same with the buttermilk fried chicken which seems to be their most popular dish (not as much flavor as expected and ours were a bit dried out). The soba malfadine carbonara was great! I added some salt to bring out the flavors after breaking the yolk but I liked the fusion between Japanese + Italian.

Dessert was awesome. Loved the donut and mud pie combo. Donut could’ve been hotter but I imagine it’s because of our large party + the extra 45 seconds of the HBD song 😆

Overall, I didn’t think it was worth the $40 price tag, mostly because the quantities weren’t on par. Now, this might be due to the group/family style/restaurant week factor but none of us left full. One note about their service: they graciously comped one meal as my gluten-free guest was mostly neglected throughout the meal. I had to ask several times what she could eat and what she couldn’t eat despite stating in advance and getting confirmation days before) her dietary restrictions. That bit was disappointing but this stuff happens and I appreciated their manager apologizing profusely and making amends. Would I return? Possibly but perhaps with a smaller group.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrtRi4Mpx-TOcNaUM3H1m8YrnJbMWK9JvKMZ0j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPczzrmgKs-JcEbOGn0awT-uhRz2_RN3qIBM0lc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8OpMoV3F6MiJyZAd2tyHwU4bdGsDOkCrd8_ZG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuk3ScnXTzE_MJ6YGlm6uFL5NUc1ZFgW8hP-Ut=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNswfzCXkjb2C8HdoyjggXKVZgU8l6Obdkrjna6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
We had a 10:30 am brunch reservation were the first guests to arrive.  The hostess asked us to wait and than asked if we had reservation I said yes and provided the name of reservation.
She proceeded to walk us out the door of the main dining to the overflow annex a cold less comfortable environment.  I thought it was extremely odd, trying not to assume the worst.
My party was disappointed started looking for new restaurant for brunch. The waitress was kind & closed the door the temperature of the room became acceptable and we stayed.

The food arrived  some was excellent and other items not so much the chicken appeared to be pre fried and fried again.

There was a lack of coffee choices no alternative milk.

They began seating people in our area 35 minutes later overheard party stating they did not have reservations.

I would not recommend this restaurant<//Review>

Yum! This was a delicious night out. The three of us ordered starters and mains, and shared a dessert. Everything was excellent, including the service.
I don't get to this area often but I'll definitely be back here the next time I am.</Text>

< Review>
I'm not usually one to write reviews when stuff isn't the best but all parts of this experience was a huge bummer. I ordered off of caviar, and I live a few blocks away so it shouldn't have been an ordeal. I placed the order, and waited an hour before calling Hopscotch to see what the status was. After calling twice and being hung up on as soon as someone picked up the phone, I finally got through. They said the order was on the way. I waited another hour and called again. Still on the way. After two hours I get my meal and it's completely burnt. Really bad communication and terrible quality.<//Review>

<review>I had the kimchee with pork belly. The pork belly addition was not worth it as it was mostly fat. The Meal lacked much flavor and needed salt and pepper. However the Pimms cup cocktail was very tasty. The prices here average around $15-20.

I wish I had a video of the experience because it was just SO sweet. But first and foremost let me tell you the meal was scrumptious. Eggs Benedict salmon style: Perfect poached eggs with very yummy hollandaise on thick fresh lovely egg bread - a hunk of smoked salmon - juicy and house made - and the best brunch potatoes I ever ate - made in their own little individual caste iron pan. Delish green salad or fruit salad also part of the game. The server was a guy so kind so thoughtful and professional it brought out my Cheshire Cat smile! I’ve now gone several times with family and friends and Hopscotch has that kind of discipline and consistency I really do love. Bartender is also a sweetheart. I do happen to like their red leather bistro diner look. I’m the spoiled one so trust me. Top notch effort and cuisine. Go uptown for this one!</text>< Rate>

< Review>
I went for brunch and got the kimchi fried rice with pork belly. It sounded great in the beginning but when it finally arrived, the fried rice was overly salty, the pork belly tasted really flat. It's pretty to look at (when adorned with so many onsen eggs) but when you eat it, it ends up being a burden to eat it all.

I did get the doughnut as an appetizer (it should be treated like a dessert). It tastes like what you can get at Doughnut Dolly's, so you should just go there instead.< /Review>

The waitress charged 20% for the tip. We were seated in the other part of restaurant that didn't have ac. It was super hot and they gave me not so cold water. They had a great sirloin steak though. Although the steak was well done, they were still very moist and soft.</review>

Hands down the best restaurant in Oakland.  Their pork chop is my favorite thing to eat when it is on the menu.  Last time I had braised Lamb neck which sounds a little adventurous, but blew everyone in the group away.  Wine list and service are on point too.  Fried chicken is awesome, but I feel like there are too many other good items on the menu to warrant ordering it unless you are in a big group.  Should be everyone's go to restaurant recommendation if anyone asks because they are always consistent and won't let you down.</Text>

We've been coming here for a few years now and I'm never disappointed. The food is excellent and the service is great. The only downsides is that we live far from it and that it's in a marginally shady area. But hey, it's a risk I'm willing to take to come here.< /text>

<review>Hopscotch is a tastefully laid out American Japanese fusion food affaire. Small restaurant with seating for maybe 30 inside, a few tables outside.

Our food was pretty stellar. Fried chicken, biscuits and gravy, country potatoes, all great. Drinks were good as well (gin fizz). We did have to wait over 30 minutes for our order to be retaken because our bartender forgot to put it in, so I have to detract a star for that; realistically, I don't see service being an issue at all normally.

Also a great selection of unique scotches which I can't wait to try next time. Be aware the prices are not cheap but the food portions are pretty generous. This place is worth a try, you won't regret it.< /review>< pictures>

This place was recommended and came for lunch.  I tried the Tonkatsu sandwich, breaded pork and slaw.  It was DELICIOUS; especially with the hot sauce. I got it with the chips and it was a great compliment.Also shared a side salad that was fresh and very well made.< /Review>

Simple, well - executed dishes with an excellent combination of flavors. We came here during 'restaurant week' and they had an odd menu combination where some things had to be ordered as a package deal, which was unnecessary. The waitress was great about explaining it and finding solutions though. Generally very good service. The restaurant itself is small and loud, which can be good or bad depending on what kind of night you are looking for. Felt a bit cramped but the food made up for it. Overall a good experience.<//Review>

Great "upscale diner" food. Would have been 5 stars except our waitress seemed alternately engaged in providing good service and indifferent. So, the service seemed slightly"off" for lack of a better term.< /Review>

<Text>Excellent food and service. This is a bit of a hole-in-the-wall with four tables outside and maybe ten inside. You can also eat at the bar. Their mixed drinks are excellent and unusual. Our shared starter of tempura-fried vegetables was very tasty, but a bit on the greasy side. Two of us had the buttermilk fried chicken and one the halibut. All the mains were great. We shared one dessert, the doughnuts. Don't be put off by the name. Try it. Overall I would give Hopscotch five stars except I think it is overpriced. Three of us with drinks, a bottle of wine, one starter, one dessert and three mains racked up a bill of $270 with tip. That is very expensive for what and where it is.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f80ae5ae98e41:0x77d349a4ec94a7e3<//gmapID></record>

You must eat the fried chicken here, if only to wonder at the art of the person who broke it down. Lots to love, exactly the type of opinionated idiosyncratic place you want for a neighborhood joint. Get the fried chicken tho.</Review>

Hopscotch got in touch and pointed out, quite rightly, that my initial review was not helpful. So I am elaborating a bit. I have heard a lot about this restaurant and was simply disappointed.  Getting served initially took some time. Our party was served after a party of the same size who arrived and was seated well after us, which is always a bit disappointing. However once service began the wait staff was very kind and attentive throughout the remainder of the meal. I had the fried chicken. The salad accompanying it was great, flavorful and fresh. The chicken was rather bland, and not evenly cooked throughout.<//text>

Cute little place for some simple but good food. The food portion of the menu is small - 5 or 6 entrees and another 5 or 6 appetizers. The wine selection is quite big and the prices are pretty reasonable. They also have 4 or 5 draft beers to choose from. The food is good quality and done with care and creativity. There is bit of Japanese/Asian influence but overall result is very good. The service is very good. The staff is courteous and attentive without being intrusive. This will be my go-to place if I am in the Oakland area.</review>

Overpriced for portion size and flavor (everything was fine, but not exciting). But service was good and the place had a great vibe. Although, as someone with vision impairments, I HATE dark restaurants...I needed a flashlight to read the menu...</text>

Nice place for a light meal. Came here with a group of five for dinner and we were able to be seated outside right away which was great. We had cocktails which were pricey but they were delicious, too. The waitstaff were very attentive and patient with us as we took forever to decide what we wanted. In the end, three of us got the hamburger because it was the cheapest entree option and the other entrees seemed very overpriced, but the appetizers were smaller. One person in our party got the soba noodles which she did not recommend and did not finish. The burgers were good (comes with beef tongue on top which was very tasty!). Overall, we were happy with our choice of coming here, especially because it was a beautiful day and we were sitting outside.</text>

A great spot to sit and stay late with friends.  Friendly staff, and they even allow you to taste a wine if you have a question.  Our table had the oysters—nice and fresh.  I enjoyed my pork, and the tri-tip was very tasty, as was the trout.  Try the dessert menu—small but fun.  Finally, we had takeaway friend chicken.< /text>

Some things on the menu change, some stay the same. Asian inspired modern California cuisine. The fried chicken is amazing, the burger is great. Other than that, I recommend getting a bunch of the small plates and sharing a big one or two. Pretty good beer selection, all the cocktails I've gotten there were great.<//review>

I love their food, they have a great selection of Japanese whiskeys and great cocktails like "Sizzle it", but the bartenders are dry and unapproachable. I like Aubrey and Nomi, the place is chilled but again If I'm going to spend $80-100 on a meal with 2 cocktails the least I expect is a smile or some type of interaction from the bartender otherwise I'm just giving my money to a light pole.<//review>

<Review>We had the fried chicken with gravy, the donuts, and the hopscotch burger. The fried chicken was phenomenal, one of the best I've had in the East bay. The burger was tender and juicy, and I'd say on the top 5 burgers I've had though perhaps a little too drippy. The donuts were small portion for the price but they include a delicious butterscotch cream that is really good. Brunch is definitely the best time to go but seating is limited so be prepared to wait.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808f80ae5ae98e41:0x77d349a4ec94a7e3<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nice ambience, but fried chicken was far from stellar. Seasoning on skin was too strong and distracting, with the whole fried chicken piece being difficult to eat. Strongly recommend trying a different dish.< /Review>

<Review>Interesting spot with a curious admixture of California Nouveaux and Asian influences.

I love the superbly prepared and presented dishes.
Always excellent fresh oysters and ice cold beer.</Review>< pictures>

If you find yourself in Oakland, unsure about where to get food,go to Hopscotch. This place will make your food dreams come true. I ordered the Lotus fritters (delicious) as my starter, and the Pork chop‎ (amazing) as my main course. Those were the two best choices I had made in a while. The fritters were perfect. The right combination  of crunch and acidity. The pork chop was the star. It is a very thick cut of meat. But unlike more expensive restaurants I have visited, this pork chops was perfectly cooked. It was juicy and full of flavor... Magical. The sides were just as good. ‎My advice, hop over as soon as you can.<//review>

Cool little unique spot, but just not for me. If you're introducing yourself to this place, try out the burger. I had never had cow tongue before this and it was actually a nice touch. My waitress Atalya was quite nice as well.<//Review>

I went here with a group of about 10 for our holiday lunch. The food was all really good. I had the first base burger with bacon and cheese and a few of the appetizers. It was a little weird that we were seated in a different space two doors down from the main restaurant. It also took quite a while to have our meal. While I appreciate a good leisurely meal, 2.5 hours was a long time for a lunch.<//text>

< Review>
I love this kind of upscale Japanese-American fusion food. I haven't seen that much Japanese-American fusion, so I thought that this place was pretty cool and unique. I really enjoyed the food here and the interesting flavors that come from combining Japanese cuisine with American cuisine. I came here for the brunch and got the Braised Pork Belly Benedict. It was very nontraditional and different from a regular eggs benedict. The pork belly had a soy sauce asian flavor which was very interesting in combination with the hollandaise. It was also very tender and fatty which added more richness to the dish. The dish as a whole was almost too rich and I'm glad it came with a side salad.<//Review>

The waiter (who coincidentally asked if a vodka soda was on the rocks or not) didn’t appear concerned or apologetic about the chiefs inability to cook a pork chop.

If a dish is not to a guests liking, we are happy to fix it or get something else out as soon as possible.

Delicious, delicious, delicious!! Four people, 3 different plates and everyone was super satisfied! I had the buttermilk chicken sandwich, someone else had the pulled pork sandwich and lastly the hamburger with french fries and a delicious dipping sauce. Perfect for lunch, it's close to the courthouse so parking was not a problem and there's outdoor seating too. Do try!!</text>

We ordered the uni ravioli, the asparagus, and the fried chicken. The uni ravioli is a magic trick invented to allow you to imagine a sashimi scallop wrapped around uni is a ravioli, supported by shoshito oil and herbs. OMG. The asparagus, perfectly firm without any woodiness, had a lovely mayo sauce, flakes of parmesan, and the platonic ideal of anchovy slivers (silver skin, a gentle salty smoky flavor). The buttermilk fried chicken was slightly hot, and a confusing anatomy of white meat (even on the drumstick) and wonderfully crunchy crust. A house-made chili sauce, thin, clear, hot and still with flavor, was provide in a cruet. You must get yourself here.<//Review>

<Review>Went for drinks and was not impressed. I sent mine back thinking it was made incorrectly, but they assured me that is how it was intended. They brought me a different drink and it was fine. The guys next to us were losing their minds over the fried chicken. I'll come back to try that, but stick to water.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>We order out from Zacharys at least once a month. The restaurant is small and crowded at night so we always do take out! Best deep dish - spinach and mushroom and good health chicken. Now we also order gluten- free but can't get in deep dish - still delicious but flat!

Hopscotch is supposedly a "trendy" restaurant in the  Alameda/Oakland area that my wife and I visited on our Honeymoon. It has way too limited seating which is not ADA friendly what so ever. And while the food is eclectic, the taste is lacking. It is certainly not worth the price.<//Review>

Everything was solid. Managed to catch it for Restaurant Week. Our server Felicia gave great recommendations and, Jordan whips up a killer cocktail. Personally I'm not generally a coffee drinker. So I tend to sweeten things up and lighten them as well. Not in this case. Coffee needed nothing except to be enjoyed. Don't hesitate.</review>

This restaurants flavor profile and food combinations are terrible! That cannot be a true chef creating that menu. Cod is a soft fish great for stews or battering. They served it with cooked spinach and miso. It was an extremely mushy dish. No texture. The fried chicken came in a bed of cabbage. It was fried hard and had thin and dry batter. The sunchokes were tasty, but needed an aioli or some type of Sauce. The chicken could use some dipping sauce also. They served cold mozzarella on top of cooked veggies. And gave us tiny, cold, uncooked tofu cubes with what tasted like the sweet red sauce you get from the Chinese restaurant. Absolutely nothing about anything on that menu was worth our $150 meal. Fortunately the company paid for it, but we could've went ANYWHERE cheaper and had quality options. The idea is high end, but the food is not.</Review>

If there's a better place for brunch in Oakland, I don't know what it is. I can't seem to stop coming here. The bartenders - Aubrey and Cody - make excellent cocktails. But then, Hopscotch has a compelling list of Japanese whiskeys in addition to Scotch, bourbon whiskeys and Irish whiskeys. Then there's the food - the buttermilk fried chicken and biscuit with sausage gravy is superb. So too are the benedicts - they should just bottle their hollandaise sauce. Oysters - outstanding. The Thistle Meat bacon - outstanding. The wine list.... I could go on and on. Just go!!</Review>

Great cocktails but our service was comically slow. They were in between shifts for part of it and was presumably our order was lost along the way. I'll plan to go back but not for the chip on the waitresses shoulder.<//text>

<review>I tried the chicken and biscuits and the eggs benedict with pork belly. The pork belly seems like more of an afterthought, nothing really special about them. The fried chicken is really good though, very moist and flavorful throughout. They have a house made hot sauce that is not really hot at all, but it does add a nice layer of acid to the chicken, which will help to cut through the rich gravy.</review><user_name>Michael Lee<//user_name>< Pictures>

We had to wait for several parties to be seated before us, eventhough we had a reservation. Service was slow and unfriendly. What earns the two star rating though more than anything is that the waiter asked us 'what do think about the menu?' but when I expressed that I thought there weren't re enough vegeterian friendly brunch options he got super defensive. Food was only meh.< /text>

Yummy!   The French toast, the fried chicken & biscuits (oh those stick-to-your-ribs bisquits!), not to mention the au gratin potatoes in the adorable little skillet!  The coffee was a bit light & blue-borrle-esque for my tastes, but the rest was amazing, with fantastic friendly service.<//review>

The music was old skool awesome, the retro atmosphere was fun and the food was delicious!!! I don't eat pork but my family said the pork belly bacon was the highlight of their meals. My fried chicken was light, flaky and seasoned amazingly😉 I will be back on my next visit!< /Review>

probably the best cocktails in east bay.  the food is really good too.  the price is higher than what you're getting though.  can get crowded with cramped seating - main reason I stopped going there.</review>

<text>Make sure to schedule a reservation. We didn't, went before a concert at the Fox last minute, and got stuck in the weird side building they have for spillover. Prepared to drop some dough on tasty food. They burger and fries chicken were fantastic! So were the sunchokes (my new favorite veggie).  The tequila drink was strong and perfect for some concert pre gaming. I'll be back here, but I'll make a reservation ahead of time and come back for more special occasions. My boyfriend and I super loud people, so this place might just be a little more formal than we are prepared to handle lol< /text>< pictures>

A local gem. Their fried chicken is delicious, as are their occasional pork tenderloins. The space is cosy and cute. Excellent cocktails to boot!<//Review>

<Review>Uni (sea urchin) & Salmon Roe, served on an Oyster. This is easily the most decadent seafood dish I've ever had. If you're still reading this hurry up and make a reso.

The menu is simple, but the flavours are complex, a lot of thought has gone I to the profiles of each dish.  If you're still reading this hurry up and make a reso.

These guys get a lunch crowd so If you're still reading this hurry up and make a reso.<//Review>< Time>

The small restaurant was full so they took us doen a couple of doors to a separate room. While it was nice not to have the noise of the main dining room, it was cold and somewhat strange to be there by ourselves.

Service was efficient. The selections came out after an exceptionally long time. The food was good but not amazingly so. The waitress would not split the check so we ended up scrambling for eho paid for what,  which was unnecessary.

Doubt I'll come back with similar offerings all around the area and more pleasant staff and environments.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

A casual dining venue with a bar in an up and coming neighborhood. The fried chicken is a must try, something about the coating that makes it crispy and juicy. The oysters and fish were good too.</Review>

I got the Salmon. It was delicious, and tiny. I also got the chocolate mousse for dessert, and it was one of the more amazing things I've had. Haven't tried the wine selection, but their whiskey selection covered some very delicious names (Lagavulin, for one).<//Review>

I will drive across town (when I could be sleeping in) to ensure I get a table for brunch at Hopscotch. Or, I could simply make a reservation. It's worth it. Everything we've had here is worthwhile. First base burger,  fried chicken, hash, tonkatsu sandwich... for me, the standout is the kimchee fried rice with pork belly and jidoku eggs. Servers are quick and friendly; bartender is amazingly talented and just the right amount of chatty, ingredients are stellar and it all adds up to the pot o' gold experience. Post-brunch satisfaction has reached its zenith, thanks to Hopscotch.</review>

Wow, what a satisfying meal. We started with an avocado and seaweed salad featuring a perfectly ripe avocado, next had an amazing burger with beef tongue on top, and finished up with housemade sorbet. Great selection of wines and scotches too, along with pleasant peeps taking care of you. Top pick!< /review>

We were excited to come here. It went downhill the moment we arrived. The hostess quoted a 2 hour wait, with only 2 parties of 2 ahead of us. We decided to wait and were sitting at a table less than 20 minutes later. We ordered. The food finally arrived and was lackluster. Nothing too memorable. I would pass with so many other great spots in the area.<//review>

The wait staff was pretty nice.  The food on the other hand was bland if not bad. I mean I make a better chicken and biscuits at home. Also, way too pricey $25 are you kidding me I can go to any chicken place a get Food for a family of 5 for that amount and I barely got enough for myself.  And if you are going to scramble eggs add salt and pepper or at least give me the option to do so. The greens tasted like foot and horseradish. The potato were OK I guess but they were served in a cast iron pan which would be ok except as we all know cast iron can not be washed the one I had been served had been the potato did have rusty after taste. Such a waste of money.< /text>

<review>This is a well-established white-tablecloth Italian fixture in the Rockridge restaurant zone, featuring fresh local ingredients. It's classy in terms of ambiance, service, and menu; the offerings are reasonably comprehensive, and just about everything is very good though not spectacular. The pasta dishes (primi) recommended.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The food here is pretty bad... the burger meat was not well put together and we asked for medium and we got extra rare. It was really gross. They forgot our drink order, but they were apologetic and service was really nice. 1 star for the food, 4 stars for the service.</text>

Decent but small draft list and a great selection of mixed drinks. Their HopScotch (beer + a shot of scotch) is a bit pricey but it has a great presentation and is a nice treat.< /Review>

The staff was attentive, friendly and worked well as a team. I wish the food worked well. Our party was 3 and not one of us gave the food high marks.

The uni in the Yonsei Oysters were undetectable. The oyster and salmon roe overpowered the Uni.

I couldn't taste the tongue in the 1st Base Burger. Luckily it was served cut in half and I picked out the tongue to eat it plain.

Happy hour beer was served in smaller glasses, so not a real happy hour price.

I did enjoy the desserts: Mochi Cake and Butterscotch Pudding.

I had high hopes as the ingredients were intriguing. I probably won't be going back as my try list for the Bay Area is pretty long, but I would give it a try again if someone asked me to go - only because the staff was great and the menu looked great. The food wasn't bad, just didn't the high price.</Text>

<Text>It's wonderful to dine in a restaurant where there are no strangers. In Hopscotch, a less than 40 seat bistro meets diner mid-priced Japanese‑inspired restaurant in "Uptown Oakland", no one is a stranger. It's steps aways from the Fox Theater and, with a few more steps, the Paramount Theater. A new "stranger" is greeted by Jenny and feed by Kyle (co-owners) only to be most welcomed by Jason the mixologist behind the oversized blue white marbled counter. And there was no "bottom two" ingredients deleted from his complex cocktails. Of which are enough to fill several menus; check it out: our two menus didn't match when it came to the cocktail list. And that kind of says it about Hopscotch. Worth checking out.</Text>< pictures>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>Awesome little spot. I tried the oyster with uni and roe and it was delicious and refreshing. I thought that the uni would overpower every flavor but it was not the case: I was able to test and appreciate every ingredient. For entree I opted for the pork belly benedicts on challah bread. Very tasty! The yusu hollandaise was something else and the eggs very fresh. The side salad was great. Not a big fan of their potatoes.

My friend loved their wasabi Virgin Mary.

I'll definitely come back!< /Text>< pics>

I finally got to try this Oakland resto that everyone raves about. I went for lunch at got the fried chicken. I generally prefer white meat, but they served it dark, and it was delicious! :D I also love the white beans they serve on the side. I just wish they had more of them. I got the Duck Fat chips with aioli, but those were just okay. I'd definitely come back and try dinner.< /Text>

<rating>2</rating><text>I was out working my 2nd job for my family and wife who was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and was directed pick up an order for the 1st time . I was informed that there was some discrepancy in payment and the credit card paid all except $0.45 and as the waitress begin to tell me politely the manager jumps in and immediately starts attacking the company I work for and me. He was very rude, he cut me off before I could even begin to talk. I couldn't even get half of one letter out of my mouth before I was met with such a harsh and angry attitude . I felt very uncomfortable. I just paid the money out of my pocket so that I continue having a great day .  This being my first time at this place I was excited about coming back as a customer as I sat there enjoying the music and look of this bar until I was met with very biased, angry, and what felt like some sort of secret Prejudice from management only . The staff there seem pretty nice but I would not patronize this place nor will I tell my friends about it and we have a large social media network and at least 40% live here in the bay area.  The prices are not worth the service from the Management Staff.< /text>< pictures>

It's awesome.  Japanese, Southern, who knows really what it is.  But, it's awesome. All well executed, including the cocktails.<//Review>

Great meal with an A+ pork chop. The lighting was a little darker than I'd prefer, though.< /Review>

<review>A charming quaint local Oakland spot with wonderful food.  We sat at the bar and ordered what the bartender recommended which included beer steamed clams, kanpachi sashimi, and the duck liver pate and opted for the fried chicken for dinner.  All were quite good and wonderfully prepared.  The service was attentive and good.  The decor is that of a friendly neighborhood bistro.  I called a half an hour before we arrived asking if there was availability at the bar.  We had to wait about five minutes when we got there but then a spot cleared up for us.  It's nice that they have a few chairs outside and it's a pleasant place to wait and take in the city on a warm night.

We will definitely be back.<//review><user_id>104987932455782713675<//user_id>< username>

<text>Pros:
- trendy atmosphere
- decently fast service

Cons:
- food was average and rather forgettable
- I couldn't really find the "Asian" influence in the dishes
- extremely crowded and cramped
- over-hyped on Yelp

Bottom line: I won't be returning. But other diners seem to have good experiences, so maybe I was just unlucky.</text>< Pics>

<Date>1417714536157<//Date><Rate>3</Rate><Text>Hopscotch can be a very conflicting experience.  Brunch is great; dinner is lackluster.  Service is great; then it sucks.  One dish can be amazing; the next dish can be a dud.  I've been here a few times, and always leave scratching my head, wondering how I should feel.  Here are some takeaways:

First of all, the place is TINY.  I think maybe eight tables and a bar with eight stools.  It can be very crowded, so factor that into your plans.

Brunch is very solid.  The fried chicken is out of this world, maybe the best I've had in California.  The Bloody Mary is fantastic.  They'll even do a solid French 75, which isn't always the best experience if the bartender doesn't know their stuff.  If you sit at the bar, the bartenders are always pleasant and your service (and your cocktails) will be great.  Get the donuts, you won't regret it.

A few days ago we went in for a Christmas special "whole lamb platter," which consisted of a few different cuts of lamb, broccoli romanesco, cauliflower puree, and cornbread.  It sounded good in the e-mail, but the dinner was just... underwhelming.  For $65 we got a "portion for two" that was generously made for one, and immediately regretted not ordering something else.  All of the food was fine, but none of it was special.

The service was also pretty bad.  When we asked for cocktail pairings instead of wine pairings, the waitress basically said, "Um, well, the wine is really good. Are you sure you don't want wine?" and then offered no help when it came to cocktails.  In a place that actually has a great bar, you'd think they would be more willing to talk cocktails.  We felt like we were being pushed hard towards the wine pairings in a gross, upselly-type way, and it was a bummer.

I keep thinking I should go back to Hopscotch and give them another try, because for every negative point, there's a positive point.  Really and truly, I've had some great bites and drinks here.  But it's just not solid enough to stay in my thoughts or stomach for long, especially with so many great restaurants in the Oakland/Berkeley area.

Hopscotch needs to up its game.  There are some ballers around here.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Review>I enjoyed the Unagi (eel) & Cucumber starter, the Greens & Shrooms starter, and the Chika Chika Slang (or something) cocktail. Everything tasted great, unique, and high quality. Portions were small for their price but probably still worthy. I would have loved some carbs on the side; I wanted potatoes at the end... hah! The bartender was cool and the vibes were good. I found that the food overall was pricey yet yummy and a great experience for those certain occasions.</Review>< Pics>

<name>Sonya Li<//name><user_id>114907595278616299758<//user_id><Resp>None< /Resp><Pics>None</Pics><review>My partner and I started with the Yonsei Oyster and the fries. The oyster came with uni, salmon roe, and citrus soy. I didn’t taste a citrus element, the soy was light like a dashi, but it was surprisingly really good in a decadent way and it felt refreshing in the Oakland heat. If I had known how delicious they were, I would have ordered a dozen of these!

The fries were crispy and it came with a Frenso chili aioli that was creamy, a touch spicy, and it’s something every fatty like me would enjoy.

I ordered the First Base Burger and it came with a house ground chuck, griddled beef tongue, pickled onions, and sesame aioli with a side of Kennebec chips. You can also add bacon or cheddar and I opted for the latter. It’s not a homerun, but still exciting in its own way. I asked for medium rare and received a rare patty but I found it to tender and juicy. The aioli was sparse so I can’t tell you what it tasted like, but the pickled onion added a nice contrast to the beef and the sweet bun.

My partner ordered the chicken club and it came with lettuce, cabbage, bacon, tomato, and fried chicken. It was simple but the fried chicken took it up a notch. I only had a bite but have to get it the next time we visit.

Items do not appear as described but we had a good meal here.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Came here with a friend for brunch on a Sunday morning around 10:45. Since it was still early, we were seated right away, outside on the patio per our request. Service was wonderful and quick, and they made some nice suggestions for brunch, although their menu is really limited and very much Asian-inspired.

We started our meal with a carafe of Mimosas for $15, which equates to about 1.5 drinks per person. My friend had the kimchi fried rice with miso marinated jidori eggs. We hadn't expected her rice to be so moist and wet, more on the side of risotto than fried rice, though still good. I had the pork belly eggs benedict, which came with a side salad and skillet potatoes. The Benedict was good, though really rich with the creaminess of the egg yolk, hollandaise sauce, and pork belly fat. The side frisee salad had a nice tart vinegrette. The skillet potatoes came out pipping hot on a small cast iron skillet, though it was rather creamy and cheesy, more like potatoes au gratin than the skillet homefries I was expecting for brunch. Since the pork belly eggs benedict was already so rich, the potatoes seemed like excess. I wish I had gotten fruit as a side instead to even the meal out!

Street parking was easy to find. We found out afterwards that their is also a second half to the restaurant two doors down, so there's definitely more seating than the main location shows.< /review>< Rating>

<Time>1571689013377<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Their brunch is amazingly sweet and they even have a unique way of preparing their food. There are seats inside and out. The quiet environment is lovely. I recommend that resto to all, especially at brunch hours!

(Original)
Brunch zao ni ya maajabu yani tamu sana na hata wana mtindo ya kipekee ya kuandaa chakula chao.  Kuna viti ndani na nje.  Mazingira tulivu ni ya kupendeza.  Napendekeza hiyo resto kwa wote, hasa saa za brunch!<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxRjfPtyGrbWcvV47D_ju-tSPC5Zg_zvaXlYPq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>
