Not high quality food at all. Not worth the price. Ordered sushi delivery and got no wasabi and no ginger and nothing no condiments and no tempura sauce fir shrimp. Horrible to have to eat it plain. It’s like ordering a hot fudge sundae and receiving no Fudge or whip cream.<//review>

Some nice topping choices for the poke bowl, but didn't seem super fresh.  Definitely better poke bowls in town.  The pad Thai was ok and was a lot of food for the price.  The spring rolls we're really good.  No bathroom in the restaurant so you need to walk to Safeway, loses a star for that.<//Text>< rate>

Lots of customizing options for your poke bowl here. Great pricing! Everything always tastes fresh. Love the ability to order online, pre pay & just walk in and grab my order from the counter all ready to go. Place looks clean and employees always masked.<//text>

Been here twice and hated the rolls! Dont know about the poke bowl but every time i had a roll from here, its just poorly made. Shrimp inside the roll was cold and not even crispy. The rolls fell apart every time i tried to grab with my chopsticks. The tai iced tea was good however. But i think they should hire a new sushi chef or lower their sushi price. Couldnt believe i paid 27$ for 2 poorly made rolls<//text>

This is the first time I ordered my own poke bowl.  I would have liked a little more help choosing what to get.  The amount of sauce to rice was way off.  It was good but not as good as my friend got me somewhere else.   The California roll was delicious!< /Review>

I go here often enough that I feel obligated to leave it five stars. I've actually never had their poke (it's never been my thing) but all of their Thai dishes are great. The Tom Kha, the Yellow Noodles, fried rice, all awesome. Special shout out to Fried Chicken Over Rice, a huge slab of fried chicken katsu of a bed of simple egg fried rice. Probably the best hangover meal I could ever ask for.</review>

This place was amazing at everything up until 2/28 when they re-opened the kitchen with a new Chef.Specifically the Curry. The issue is reducing the size of portions by more than 3/4  while charging the same price and then when asked we were lied to about it being the same size in a different container. The new amount inside of its new packaging literally fits inside of the old portion container with room to spare. The Curry itself is still tasty, no longer has bamboo shoots and instead has lots of other veggies but much, MUCH less curry itself. Probably wont be eating there anymore, very disappointed in place I loved.</review>

On 6/8/2020 my wife and I bought food (for take-out) for the first time at I Fish Poke Bar. My Pad Thai was great. My wife’s Poke Bowl was soooo spicey she couldn’t eat it all. She actually rinsed it off with tap water! I Fish Poke Bar would do well to warn folks about spicey-burn dressings, or added burning spices.<//Text>

Lucky Poke is my favorite poke place, but this place is really good too. I really like sushi burritos so I was excited to find another place that has them! The food tasted great, their hours are pretty good, and the staff was super friendly and courteous.

I definitely recommend checking it out!</Text>

I love their poké! Not only do they have ahi tuna but it's one of the few places I've been to that properly washes their rice and also uses sushi rice. One of the few poké places that's good as leftovers as the rice doesnt become a huge inedible mass after cooling.<//Review>

This is literally the ONLY place I go to for a poke bowl. I grew up in Hawaii and this place seriously reminds me of home. I can't rave enough about the great service too! If you don't get the spicy mayo sauce then you haven't really lived yet. Five stars forever!<//review>

Quality is pretty good and convenience of the online order tab is very easy to use. They also provide the Grubhub option which was the way I knew about this restaurant at the first time. Like I said the quality is fine but it is a bit priceyyyyy that is the downside, but I am going to use this anyway because this is the only one affordable sushi burrito place in this area :p<//Review>

<text>I know people who swear by this place, but unfortunately I have been 3 or 4 times and never had a positive experience. The poke bar does have a lot of options, but it didnt taste fresh to me at all. The sushi is lower quality than premade sushi youd find at a Safeway or Raleys in my opinion. The time I ordered a thai soup there was a long hair in it which I found a couple bites deep. The people are very very nice, but the food is just not up to par with the cleaner, more conveniently located poke options in town. Also if you order pickup online there is a convenience fee.<//text>< pictures>

<UserId.>116954688836177264602<//UserId.><Name>Christina Marie<//Name><Review>This is not authentic thai food. I ordered a green curry which is supposed to be made with coconut milk. This was made with dairy instead. It doesn’t have much thai or curry spice and other options ask what type of meat you want. Curry and rice does not say it includes meat on their menu. If you’re reading this and it does they updated it. The only animal products ever used in thai curry is usually fish sauce. Dairy is an allergen and if your food includes me that needs to be in the description like all the other menu products.</Review></record>

I thought it was great. Fresh with lots of choices and very generous portions. I got the bowl, friendly staff & I will be back!
P.S. bring a sweater, I think it's cold so things will stay fresh.<//review>

Ordered pad thai, cheese wontons, and a thai iced tee. Pad Thai was really lackluster, couldn't finish it. Cheese wontons were straight gross, like the cream cheese had gone bad. Last but not least, the thai iced tea, which was apparently cheap black tea with milk. Not great all around.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Went for a second visit tonight.  It was very delicious! The avocado spring roll was fresh, well made, and came with a tasty sweet chile sauce. The veggie bowl and veggie deluxe were both well made, but the veggie bowl, like all their bowls, is customizable to match your palate.  As before, the staff bent over backwards to be as helpful as they could.<//text>

<Review>Went here 2 days after they opened. and compared to the poke place that I usually go to, there were quite a few issues with this poke bar.
Pros:
-The scoops of fish were large.
Cons:
-Not all the toppings and sauces that they have are listed on the menu so if you don't know what something is called and its not labelled then you are out of luck.
-The slices of cucumber that they had were huge/ way too thick.
-The crab salad was overall dry. as if it had no mayo in it at all.
I'll probably try this location again soon-ish. but for now this is not my top choice for poke in Chico.< /Review>< Date>

Better than ever! This restaurant is truly the best when it comes to its pizza and pasta. The taste of it is truly heavenly, and I must say that they have the best service in the area. I could not ask for more from these guys because everything was so tasty and delightful. Kudos for the amazing job! Thank you so much!<//Text>

Honestly the food was worth the price ! The fresh made ingredients and made to order pizza was so delicious! I would definitely recommend give this place a try if you haven’t. The staff was super friendly and the food wasn’t a long wait at all .< /Review>

<text>We had the best pizza of our lives last night! We went to this pizza parlor and ordered Pepperoni and beer, their best-sellers, great! We've been having so much fun.

You must have a slice of pizza at this Pizza Restaurant! This is where you go to get one. Their slice is thin, crispy, and one of the best I've ever had! You can tell they use high-quality cheese because it never burns your tongue. Plain fresh mozzarella or any other toppings here are delicious. A must visit place!< /Review>

Yummy Pizza Ever! Surely, I'll come back to this restaurant! The waiters/waitresses were very accommodating to the clients, nice, and respectful. In addition, their place was lovely and nice to visit, because it was clean, stylish, and comfortable. Overall, I enjoyed visiting and eating at your restaurant very much. Uh, thanks!

There was a really nice pizza. Excellent operation. For girls, it is appropriate. Inside or out, you should eat. It's been very busy. Some were locals, I believe. If you are in the city, it is so convenient.</text>

We ordered their pizza and asked to bring it to us. Their pizza was the best, and every day they made their dough new. Even though it was on delivery, the pizza was still hot and the crust was still crisp when it arrived. It was the best pizza parlor in town. They even have a physical store where you can dine at any time.< /text>

I haven’t regretted the fact that I ordered lots of pizzas on their restaurant because all of the flavors were delicious and yummy. It made me crave more. Also, I’d like to acknowledge how accommodating and presentable their crews were. All of them were doing their roles and tasks accurately. Lastly, the place was all clean and tidy. See you soon!</text>

I tried POV for this first time yesterday and was so impressed by the quality and taste of all my food. I ordered the 5 Cheese pizza special on Fridays for $10, the Big Kahuna, and the Altadena salad. Everything was terrific and the pizza toppings were legit! The Big Kahuna had house baked ham, red onion, chives, and dehydrated pineapple on top. It was so good! You can taste the quality of the ingredients and every bite was amazing. The 5 Cheese pizza had their house smoked mozzarella, parmesan cheese, provolone, brie, and more mozzarella. Both pizzas were fantastic and I cannot wait to go back to try their others. I also ordered the Altadena salad which tasted like they got all of their ingredients from their backyard. It was so fresh and I thought it was cool how they used dried stone fruit in their salad. Not sure if they make it in house, but it sure tasted like it. Overall, POV gets 4 stars for me. Great service and delicious food, can't go wrong with that.<//text>

<Response>None< /Response><text>Yum. Solid deep dish pizza! Ordered the deep dish half BBQ chicken and Classic (Additional $1 for half/half). Wait time for the deep dish pizza is 30mins. Very flavorful and overall a lot of stuff in even one slice. I loved the cilantro on the BBQ chicken. A tad bit salty (but very flavorful), so would definitely recommend ordering a drink on the side. Will be back to try the thin crust BBQ chicken!<//text>< pics>

So good & super friendly! My family & I happen to stumble into this place completely unexpected & im so happy we did because it did not disappoint at all. I ordered the clucking bowl which has fries with coleslaw and chicken tender pieces & their sauce on top. They were not stingy at all with the chicken tender pieces. My family got sandwiches. The chicken is so soft & good, it isn't dry at all like other chicken places. I'm super happy this place is a short walk away from me, I'll definitely be a regular.< /review>

Amazing Deep dish pizzas at this joint.  We ordered one deep dish and one thin crust pie for 6 of us.  The deep dish was by far better and next time I would probably opt for only that.  Once you go deep dish you'll never go back.<//review>

They feature a few regular pizzas but change up their offerings based on seasonality, availability of ingredients and whim.

I've tried their PEPPERONI which they warn is not your average pepperoni. It's uncured and baked with the texture of meatloaf sausage. There's also no crispiness and just a bit of spice. It's interesting, but I just I prefer the average kind.

On Mondays, their MARGHERITA is $5 so that's a good day to go. I love that pizza and the deal.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The most amazing deep dish pizza I've ever had. I've only ever gotten the take out and even having to take a somewhat long bus ride there and back, the pizza was the best tasting deep dish ever to enter my mouth. The crust is an amazing cornmeal crust which you really wouldn't mind eating, and the toppings/sauce are exquisite. Sometimes it does take a couple of tries to get through to the store when you're calling during the busy hours, but the pizza is always ready at the quoted time. I can't wait for my next visit!!</review>

These pizzas are incredible.

We had the Lamb pizza which was probably the best pizza I've eaten in years.

That same day, we tried a few other flavors and they were all great, but size maxes out at the size of a normal dinner plate. Disappointing as you want more from a pizza, especially when you have guests.

I'd give these guys a 4 in a heartbeat, but, I marked them down because $16 for a pizza the size of a dinner plate is a bit ridiculous.

Please make larger pizzas for that price. Or just make larger pizzas please! Your toppings and crust are great.</Review>

Ahhh deep dish! Firenza Pizza Los Angeles, CA has brought the deep dish from Chicago and somehow made it better!!! I love the roasted garlic bread, spreads like butter! The veggie comes with the roasted garlic and zucchini, amazing! I love a saucy pizza with plenty of crust and garlic, little star makes my day :)</Text>

<Review>I really liked this place but recently they changed their curry chicken pizza. It doesn't really taste like curry anymore, more of a spiced pesto or something. But it's excessively spicy now and the flavor is just sort of off-putting. In addition, I'm not sure if I'm a fan of their crackery, crispy crust. I've come to this spot for about a year now and I just wasn't impressed with it this last time. Both pizzas I ordered were kinda lackluster. Not sure if I'll be back. ‍<//Review></record>

Loved the fried mozzarella and authentic Italian pizza. Crust was chewy and perfect. Super high quality and flavorful ingredients, from the cheese to the prosciutto to the olives. Very friendly service. We will be back!</Review>

Ordered the Firenza Pizza Los Angeles, CA classic. Perfect lunch for two. Delicious, and really satisfied my craving for deep dish. I'll be coming back soon.</text>

I swing by and grab a small meat lovers when ever I'm in the area. DELICIOUS pizza. Definitely top quality stuff. Would even go as far as ranking it amongst the top I've had. Keep up the great quality!<//Text>

Besides, the waiters and the waitresses out there were very accommodating and nice. Their place also was very good, nice, and new. It was my third time here and would visit again and again to eat delicious pizzas. Thank you!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The deep dish, Chicago-style pizza draws me here, the bar keeps me.  Order the classic to get a sense of the pie and get whatever IPA they have.  That's a Tuesday night in the can.<//Review>

Ate pizza and garlic balls and drank beer last night at this place. All food was good as usual. Only complaint is that beer should be colder. Admittedly, it was happy hour, but even more reason it should be ice cold. Will continue to eat here and recommend to others.< /Review>

This place is A-MAZING. Pizza so good you'll think you're in Chicago! Only drawback is their cash-only policy. But the pizza's good enough to merit a stop at the atm -- oh, and the $2 PBRs are worth it, too.. make sure you ask for a glass to pour it in (they'll give you a frosty one straight from the freezer).</Text>

I've been longing to write a review for this place but keep forgetting to! I've been here about 3-4 times now and never cease to get tired of this place. The dough they use are fresh thin chewy. The first thing you notice is the line out the door and the loud music. The ambiance of this place is ridiculously cool! Great atmosphere! They have a live oak tree in there with lights! They have out door seating with a fireplace.. the place is beautiful at night because they have everything lit up. They have quite the variety of toppings to choose from. The last time I went, I got the prisoners pizza which crust was stuffed with ricotta. Super friendly, I'd recommend guest to try this place if they get the chance!</review>

Definitely the best pizza in Los Angeles, CA  It's not as good as Zachary's in Berkeley, but I live in Los Angeles, CA, so I guess Little Star is my new go to joint (except not really because I don't live in the neighborhood, and you know how Los Angeles, CA are, if it's more than an 8 block walk away, it's kiiind of farrrrr) .... I would totally get fat from pizza if I lived within 8 blocks though, delicious.<//text>

<Review>One of my fav pizza places in LA.
You are always greeted with smile when you get in the shop. Their pizza crust is always thin and crispy as it should be.

<Text>The pizza was delish! Pretty BIG slices and all the toppings were tasty! They have a nice selection of beers on tap from a light cider to a deeper cherry stout. The service was fast and friendly! Would definitely dine in again!< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Stopped by for lunch today to try a new place out, and I was in the mood for pizza. There are a lot of these types of chains around (pizza studio, 800 degrees, piology, etc) and they're usually pretty similar. This one definitely had some different pies, like the brisket bbq or the Monterey I think it was. Not "traditional" per se but good. Quality was alright, I've had better quality at some places, this seemed a little more "fast food" than others. Service was slow and a little mixed up/confused but it worked out alright. Still new, so might just be that. I'd still come back.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNs4sy-Qq1GVcLG0cZZeW133RBgIGGqus7IpjYA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1519140757796, 'text': 'Hi Chris -\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave us a review.

I go here because a friend of mine likes to go. I have the same thing every time and maybe I should change. I have an individual pizza with pepperoni on it. It's unusually greasy and honestly not very good. Is it edible yes but when you're spending $14 for a small pizza and a soda it should be more than just edible.< /Review>

This is a pizza place that allows you to create your own pizza. They have a variety of sauces, and meat, vegetables you can add or you can just pick one of the pizza's off the board. This definitely a place I would recommend to others. They also have salads. Sandwiches, etc.</text>

<text>Really good pizza and anti-pasti in Little Italy. Dining room is small so you may have to wait, but it's worth it. The spicy cauliflower appetizer is excellent. We actually bought a bottle of the Calabria oil afterward to try to recreate it at home. Pizzas are big enough to share but we each ate our own anyway. Service was great. And right across the street is the Baked Bear for your ice cream sandwich dessert.<//text>< gmapID>

Why an authentic Margarita pizza is difficult in so much of the US, I don’t understand. But they get it here. The three colors of the Italian flag, delicious red tomato sauce, excellent mozzarella and basil. And, a nice cracker crust. Bravo.<//text>

I went to the new location on grand across the street from my apartment complex they had a special for a 10inch 2 topping pizza one per person per coupon I thought that was great for me and my son so I Order and as I'm Checking  out the guy next to the lovely lady that was handling my order tells her next time it's one per person...(I'd mention names but no one had on name tags) I pointed out that my son is a person! I feel that was rude my son is a person and has a right to his own pizza as well.. anyway other than that our two topping pizza for two dollars was good my son enjoyed his pizza.... won't be coming back for a while<//Review>

<review>This place was delicious and the service was friendly. My boss was craving pizza and I didn't even see this place! We walked in and the baking pizza smells - oh my!! I knew I found a winner. I'm picky with my pizza and let me just say it was fabulous! I took leftovers to my staff and they texted me after they ate that it was heavenly. I'm only upset that my team has gone back twice without me.....< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Called at 4p sharp on Friday and got a half plain, half peppers and mushrooms.  Got there at 6p for the arranged time, and he made it right away.  While sitting, about 5 people came up and were turned away due to the long wait time.  I think you could honestly make a side business just buying pizzas and reselling slices outside.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. They make your pizza right in front of you and place it in the oven.  Soon they will be serving alcohol they just opened not too long ago.  They have the hundred flavor Coca-Cola  machine which is a Fav for us customers who love choices.<//text>

The food is amazing but today I noticed one of the pizza prepares grabbed his ass and smell his fingers and just put gloves to continue to prepare food, I told some one and they told him but he didn't wash his hands until the 3rd pizza grosh... Wash out who prepares your pizza<//Text>

<review>What a fun event!! I felt like I was back in Florence making pizza again. From the moment I walked in armen greeted us with drinks and guided us to the area where we should sit. Ok the tables there were already so much fun yelp merch: a pizza cutter, yelp button (duhhh), $100 Postmates card, along with a Firenza Pizza coupon for one free 10” pizza. Then Stacy greeted us, who by the way flew all the way from DC to do this event for us, and told us all about how the pizzeria started, the backstory and all about the fresh ingredients such as the dough, tomatoes and cheese. Minutes later we were presented with their signature Margherita pizza. It was so delicious!! So crispy on the outside and very flavorful. Then came out the wings, first plate was chipotle wings and second plate was Cajun flavored wings. Both very tender and very juicy, a lot of meat to it. Both were delicious but chipotle definitely was a winner for me.
Then the fun began! We started to make our own pizza. Katie told us that there would be winners based on the creativity of the pizza and also the creativity of the name.
So right away I decided to think outside of the box and change the shape of my dough into a heart shape. I also decided to call it “A Pizza My Heart” .. get it?! :)
As promised by the staff, exactly 150 seconds later my pizza was on my table!! And boy did it look amazing!! I absolutely loved the flavors especially the freshness of the marinara sauce and the flavorful cheese.
It was such an amazing event and a great way to get us all fall in love with the place and actually want to go back very soon. Thank you Katie for yet another amazing event!!<//review>< pictures>

The staff at Minuteman Press Sand Creek Rd location were magnificent! I strongly recommend their services!

I am a new business owner. I opted to use Minuteman Press after an array of online print shops provided confusing and misleading pricing information, garbled my orders, and/or provided proofs of products that were incorrect or inadequate to address my needs.

The staff at Minuteman Press, Sand Creek Rd, Brentwood instantly swept away the new business owner chaos I was feeling and were attentive as they  listened to my uncertain explanations of the products I required to launch my company. The whole staff brainstormed ideas with me and made suggestions. And then they allowed me countless revisions and proofs of their work prior to printing my order. Most importantly, they made the whole process fun and enjoyable!

The combined cost of the products I received from M.M. Press was far less than the total price the online retailers were trying to charge me; and I received a far higher quality product in which every detail was perfected before it was printed. I wholeheartedly recommend Minuteman Press on Sand Creek Rd in Brentwood, CA. !!! Their employees embody the small town spirit of the community and breath new life into the idea of service with a smile!< /Review>

Antonio is very good at what he does and puts care into his profession.
I can also rely on Terry to do a great job with cutting my my smaller prints.

Love the staff at Minuteman Press.   I had to make a “memorial board” for an upcoming high school reunion which included copying part of my 30 year old high school yearbook.   I was unsure on where to start.    They gave me some great ideas, copied the pictures I needed and I was well on my way!   I will definitely be using their store time and time again.< /Review>

<review>This company would not honor their original quote sent to me that said good for 30 days. After I already PAID IN FULL and approved the proof, the called me back asking for MORE than double the amount!
One kept blaming the other, Jean, Bob, and Jeremy kept shooting me different quotes and asking for more money and refused to do the work for the agreed upon price. I’m very disappointed because I like their products but they can’t seem to get their internal workings right. A company should take more responsibility in ensuring accuracy and honoring their prices.< /review><user>108784850909685465886</user>< Date>

<text>I was married this past April and had trouble finding exactly what I wanted for my wedding invitations. I spent a few months looking everywhere you could imagine- online, in bridal stores, etc. and could not find something simple enough but with the romantic and elegant feel. I had heard of Minuteman for business cards and more corporate products but never heard anything about wedding invitations. They are right around the corner from my house so I decided to walk in and see if they could work with me to make what I had in mind. I am so happy I decided to walk in as I had my invitations made here and they were exactly what I wanted and for half the price of anything else compared online. Natasha was very easy to work with and took the time (overnight) to run a mock-up of what I described to make sure I loved what I was buying. It was such a great experience and I received numerous compliments about the invitations. My sister's wedding was 5 months after mine and she also went to try Minuteman and loved what they did for her too. Mine invitations were more simple with an elegant feel and my sisters where actually created into fans for guests to cool themselves while sitting outside. Minuteman and Natasha did an outstanding job working with my sister and I and we are both extremely happy with how our invitations came out. Thank you, Minuteman! I will definitely be back for more as events come my way.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Excellent service and pricing. They have done business cards, flyers, counter displays, and header tags for me. They have designed my magazine ads and always delivered on time.
Their graphics team is the best.
Working with them have kept my business profitable for years.
Bob and his staff are always friendly and professional.
Great to do business with a local home town business.</Review>

For many years Minuteman Press has handled my printing needs for:
* my Downtown high-end retail business
* the Downtown Brentwood Coalition
* public affairs events and media needs for a large regional church

And as I have referred countless other businesses, organizations and persons to Minuteman Press, Bob has always taken extra care with them and provided them with the same timely, professional and effective product and service that he has provided for my needs.  He is a RockStar!< /review>

<username>Coachpowell42 Fitness & Personal Training< /username><rating>3</rating><Review>My first service from this company was great (Posters printed for an event I held in 2017); however, this last experience (business cards) was a little discouraging.  My order took too long to process, and once I received it, my card design was incorrect.  But I took them home anyway, because I needed them.< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1521135386705, 'text': "Hi Dion, we're sorry that you had a bad experience, if you had a problem with the delivery, you should've mentioned it at the time of pick up.

They were not ready so I came back mid day the next day still we’re not ready. Woman gave attitude again.

My husband and I put our names down for a table. We were told it would be a 30min wait and they would call us when it was ready. So we wait for 40mins and no call. So we went back in to ask about the table. A party of three, who just got there, got a table and another couple cut in front of us in line got a table as well. I told the employee we had been waiting and she said they tried calling, which is a lie. We received no call. The employee who took down our number and recognized us didn't even acknowledge us to correct the situation. Terrible customer service.<//Text>

<Text>Stopped in for a Covid night out once outdoor seating was allowed. We were craving veggie sushi and boy were we in for a treat. All the food was fresh and service was great. We ordered a Vegetable Roll, Vegetable Tempura roll and a Vegetable hand roll. On the side we had their miso soup (souper good) and edamame. The rolls were delicious and the price was right! All Covid precautions were being taken. 👍🏼< /Text><userid>116923417257225089322< /userid>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Nice little sushi place tucked away between Foothill and Euclid. We got there right at opening time. The restaurant was clean and the layout was beautiful. We got to choose wherever we wanted to sit, and our waitress Andrea was very nice and helpful. The service was quick and the product was amazing. Maru Sushi surpassed all my expectations for a good sushi restaurant. I will definatley be returning here in the future.</Review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Small place. Not too loud. Clean. Nice menus- I appreciate that there was a photo by almost every item. Only complaint is that they forgot part of an order but they apologized and fixed it immediately. Food took a little long to get, especially since there weren’t many other customers. Good food, about average for sushi restaurants in the area.< /Review>

The food options were pretty good for me. I like baked/tempura sushi, so they definitely had a lot more options here for those than some of the other ones I have been to.

However, the service was horrible. We told the server we were out of water a couple times, no one ever came by with water. One of us had to eventually get up to the front to ask them for some water. They also messed up our check with someone else's. We understand having a busy night, and we have been to multiple restaurants on busy nights. However, we never had to wait as long as we have waited here to just get some water.

On top of that, they have an hour and a half limit. If they expect us to leave in an hour and a half. We expect a quick service. Food was good. However the service was a total disappointment.< /text>

Worst customer service. I put my name on the waiting list went out side and waited with everyone else. Went in and checked on my name the server that saw me put my name on the list told me they are not seating anyone else it was 730pm and they close at 9pm. And theu sent me on my way. Also they was only 3 tablets taken plenty of room.</Review>

<Text>Worst customer service ever, they listed their lunch price for all you can eat 21.99 we ordered the check and we were surprised that they charged us 29.99 and when we asked the owner " Sarah" she said that some of the employees were not working, that's why they have to change their price without notifying us, I told her that other places are not doing that, her answer was " NEXT TIME GO TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT ", that was my first and last visit to this place and I will never go back again.< /Text><Resp>None</Resp></record>

There were 2 Sushi Chefs. I felt that one gave a little something extra to his creations, which made a huge difference (adding oba leaf to the squid, thinly sliced lemon to the tako, and seasoning the rice with a dot of flavor). These small touches make me want to drive out of the way for something more. Thank you for caring about your craft Sushi Chef, it shows and is much appreciated.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Price was average all you can eat sushi place. But do have discounted rates on lunch time. I only eat the fresh cut and man was this place delicious with high quality taste. The place was not busy when I came which was on a Sunday early evening. My server was very nice and took care of us well. Definitely recommend this place!!!< /Review>

Have been here a few times. Always great service and great sushi. Quality of fish is never disappointing and the staff always has a smile on their faces. Recently went with a party of 13 and it went great and my family loved it. If you arent sure reading this... Please stop in and give them a shot! You wont be disappointed.</Review>

<text>One of my hobbies I do with my buddy is finding good sushi buffets. We've been to just about every sushi buffet in the Rancho / Upland area and this is by far one of the best. This is our new go to since our other one closed.

Great food
Friendly staff
Good prices
The rolls come mostly in 4 piece so you can try everything without getting full off one roll.

If you had a bad experience give it one more try.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>Best local restaurant that I know of for AYCE sushi. Maru has an excellent selection of rolls, sushi, and appetizers. For a price of $24 per person after a Yelp coupon or paper coupon from one of the coupon books from the mail, Maru is priced extremely competitively, and the food is excellent overall.

I do advise avoiding the Honeymoon roll through, unless you want to double your blood pressure within seconds.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c33148c75ac653:0xc4476bbf68e2ecc0<//gmap_id></record>

<text>The food was AWESOME! Our sushi chef was Mike and we got the all you can eat during happy hour. 99 cent beers were great. Service was wonderful. The sushi was amazing! Our chef made these delicious popcorn scallops that were unbelievable. He also recommended the Jen Jen which was delicious! We reordered those because they were just sooo good. Everything we had was delicious and fresh. Nice atmosphere, friendly service, reasonable prices, and wonderful food. I highly recommend:) definitely going back!<//text>< Pictures>

Went here because it was highly recommended by family.  They have given a few good recommendations so we went.  Not a good experience.  We had a large group of approx 30 people.  Made reservations 2 days in advance to allow for them to get an extra chef and servers to accommodate a large group.  They did not.  I was in the restaurant for almost an hour before I had to ask for a glass of water.  My wife had put in an order before I got there and 1.5 hrs later we had not received a single roll. When the rolls were brought out they were not what we ordered.  We brought that to our servers attention and we're told they would not have made it and we would have to eat it or be charged.  I could over look all of that if it had been good sushi, but the rolls I had none of them, except one, would I order again.  The fried rolls were still greasy, the rolls were not rolled tight and fell apart as I picked them up.  Overall, this was the worst AYCE sushi experience I have every had.< /Review>

If I could rate 0 I would, the service was abysmal and it took the one waitress over 15 minutes to come out from behind the counter to hand us the menus with only one other table being serviced ( restaurant was nearly empty). My family and I ordered one roll we didn’t particularly like and asked them if they could take it because it did not taste good at all, the manager came and told us that they could and we could not longer order since we did that, on top of that part of the all you can eat deal is ice cream after that, which they didn’t even offer to us. Even though they didn’t offer us this, they offered the only other group in the restaurant ice cream seeing as they had the all you can eat as well.

If you didn’t read the long review, in all they had horrendous service, pretty much ignored my group entirely and didn’t fulfill the stuff we had ordered< /Text>

I'm so disappointed. My first visit and I was so excited, then I was let down. They served my husband while I sat there watching. Then comes by and says last call. For all you can eat  (25.99) and I hadn't even received my food. I didn't even bother eating. I will never go here again.<//Text>

< Review>
The servers were great!  They were attentive, helpful & friendly.
AYCE: I only like shrimp & imitation crab but my husband likes everything & he tried a great variety of the food items & he liked every single one of them.  We will be coming back.</Review>

This place is my new favorite place for sushi.  The staff seem very friendly and the sushi I have tried so far taste fresh and delicious. Their Canadian and spicy yellowtail rolls are my favorite.<//text>

Good food and friendly staff. Was a little slower than I was expecting for lunch, but I got my fill in the all you can eat time limit, so no issue there.  Portion size is at the discretion of the chef, as is the case with sushi. This can be annoying when trying to plan all you can eat when you expect a second order to be the same size.<//review>

<text>Great sushi!

I am a big fan of sweet sushi so I ordered the pop corn roll which was great, then they recommended me the caterpillar roll with eel which was also sweet and great, although my personal favorite is the philadelphia roll that had cheese in it!

The service was top notch and the staff was very friendly!</text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Highly disappointed. We always go to sushi with our very large family. However, this was our first time at Maru and definitely our last. The food was ok, but they’re not equipped for large parties. They were lost and confused constantly. I came 45 min late and waited over an additional hour for any of my order to come out. I was told I ordered something that I didn’t and that I needed to eat it. I have no doubt someone ordered it, but it wasn’t me. My husband and 2 of my kids didn’t get water. It was just a constant fluster. We only went 1 round and we always go 3. My tip alone was $25. I am always polite and understanding to staff and generously tip, tonight I wouldn’t have tipped at all. $170 for one round of sushi that was just a nitemare. Never again!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The all you can eat is good. My favorite roll is maru roll. and can't go wrong with .99c beer and saki bombs. Service is always attentive here.< /Text>

I'm going to have to avoid any and all businesses that utilize fedex for their shipping. My deliveries have disappeared, been delivered to the wrong addresses, left in warehouses for half a year or marked as tbd for weeks without delivery. This fedex center is awful with customer service and getting packages shipped through this service is the equivalent amount of pain and suffering has getting a tooth pulled out. I will never buy anything that is shipped through fedex again. I am still waiting for items to be delivered that are sitting in their warehouses. Calling associates doesn't work and asking for pickup doesn't work. Please avoid fed ex like the plague.<//text>

Absolute worst delivery service out there. I literally avoid buying from any shop I know ships through fedex. I wish company's gave the option to choose your delivery service or stated which service they used. I ordered 2 weeks ago for my husband's birthday and paid for faster shipping my package went PAST me twice sat for 4 days and just now has an expected delivery date the entire time it just said no scheduled delivery. Been in transit for 12 days now and it's already late for his birthday. Such a joke.< /review>

<rating>1</rating><review>For 3 days in a row, fedex has not even attempted to complete the delivery, I simply receive an email that the delivery could not be completed. I've called customer service twice, and each time, they only say they'll schedule a new delivery for the next day. I've left the signed release notice on my door while I'm away at work, and I come home to see the same notice there. Further, I'm not being provided with a location to even retrieve the package, I'm only being told that the package is in a facility that is not even in the town where I live. Fedex is the absolute worst delivery service, and at a time of increased online shopping and delivery demand<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I was there around 3pm. There was just one person ahead of me. I had to wait awhile because they only allow 3 people in at a time. I just had to drop off something, so I was done in less than a minute.<//review>

FedEx has not been the best at delivery for me. Recently, every package has been around 3 days late due to the "smart post". I noticed from checking my tracking that packages routinely go past my address in Stockton to go to Sacramento, then past Stockton again to go to Tracy, then back to finally be delivered in Stockton. I called to ask why and I was told "that's just how Smart Post works" doesnt sound very "smart" to me.

A package I am waiting for now has been delayed due to "rerouting to correct address". They had the correct address, not sure what happened there.

Last delivery, the driver left my front gate open. Wasnt big deal, but it could have been if my dog was in the yard to run off. Just annoying and sloppy.

There is no way to contact customer service by email, just to call and wait on hold. And complaints don't seem to matter to anyone anyway.

If I have a choice at checkout, I would NOT choose FedEx. Get it together, FedEx! Be more efficient!< /Review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Simply awful. A simple delivery of currency asks you to stay in your house from 8:00am in the morning until 8:00 pm. This is totally absurd. No one is able to locate the truck, narrow down time. A total lovefest of incompetency. Stay away from this option. Simply ask the money to wait for you in the the nearest bank branch.< /text>< Pics>

Oh man. This place looks like an airport entrance inside now. You know like where you get your bags check and what not. I like it. Looks way better then before. Great job! Service was good.

I am waiting for Fedex truck to come as I work from home and my window is facing the road.
The truck came yesterday and the driver didn’t get down from the truck, and leave after looking at my parcel, noting attempt unsuccessful. So I request Fedex to come again the next day on 3/6/20. I started waiting in front of the door since 9am today and no delivery truck came; then I was surprised to see the status updated at 10:24am it was attempted and unsuccessful again. Tell me why should I use Fedex again with this type of service? None of the delivery truck came by, and attempt was unsuccessful?? And just force me to pick up myself even though we paid for you to delivered to door on priority over night?
If I had the choice, I won't even be giving a 1-star, Fedex you deserve no star at all.< /text>

<Review>Driver can't find our mobile home address first day, or second day. With my second call on day 2, I am told I had better pick up the package on day three or it's going back. So on day three, I am in the office at 12:45 pm and they look for the package.  Can't  find it and a supervisor comes out to say it was delivered at 12:50 pm and didn't I see it on my porch? Hello, in your office since  12:45 pm to pick up a package that not only told would definitely be there, I had called to verify before I drove down, so how was I supposed to "see" that it had been delivered?< /Review>< rate>

<Review>I requested a timeframe for them to ship me my package, but instead they deliver at random times, ex 2pm, then 11am today. I wish they could understand I can't just leave work early to sign a damn piece of paper. I requested after 3pm, and even left my number for the driver, and no response, just an even earlier delivery attempt.

I paid for priority overnight delivery. The package was to be delivered by noon the following day. At 8:20am it was loaded onto the delivery truck, and now at 4:45pm it has still not been delivered. I called customer service at 3:30pm to inquire about the missed delivery deadline, but they were no help.<//Review>

<Review>I’m having a bad experience here to get my package. After I make a phone call and talk the representative to ask her to change the drop off location to Tracy FEDEX store in grant line. I expected to get my package on the next day morning. Guess? What the representative I talk too that day wasn’t change the destination of my package. Now I have to drove my car from Tracy to 935 Performance drive STOCKTON just to get my package. These is a simple instruction that most of the customer representatives are not giving action. Shame! All of you guys. Get to work because the FEDEX company are one of the biggest company around the globe when it comes to delivering packages. But because of you guys laziness why other people move to other shipping company. Your performance job is not acceptable. If there will be less than one star rating. That’s the rate you deserved it.</Review></record>

It's okay. Dont be in a hurry. One guy in front of me and he was being helped but she was slow. Then the other employe took her sweetAZZ time to fill out a label, never said anything to me  or even I will be right with you but finished her lable and walked out. Then the other girl said she could help me and then took forever to get my package. Horrible customer experience!</review>

Fedex delievery is a JOKE. No knock, no ring, and refusing to come back and deliever after i am legitmately watching the truck leave my court. I have to wait a extra 4 days AND sign for a 35 dollar car part? Never shipping with Fedex again.</review>

I paid for over night shipping, to arrive on Friday AM. There was an error on the zip code, done by the person who typed the invoice. They claim my son over looked it so therefore it's not thier fault.  Zip code was corrected but package will be delivered on Monday because they didn't have a driving until then. Unbelievable!!! I have to personally drive over an hour to pick it up.  Oh if that isn't enough, I asked the representative to hang up so I can be transferred to the automatic survey. As I type they have not hung up 20 min has passed.  Bad customers service.</review>

The worst location ever. I ship every week from this location overnight to Chicago and it gets lost 3 times a month / maybe one package a month comes on time. Fedex is not doing anything about it !</Review>

<review>Fed up with Fed Ex. I live 2 towns away from the main facility. I wasn't home to accept my package delivery so I had to drive there to pick it up. To top it off, they wanted my ID which was in my other purse at home. Needless to say I threw a fit.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I've waited all day and paid extra to make sure it came early just to find out the package was postponed until the next day.< /Review>< pics>

Poor customer service if your package shows that it's at their facility but not due to the following day they will tell you that it's still packed so they don't have to be bothered with you and make you wait until due date!!< /Text>

The place is small but cute. The waitress is a sweet young lady. Was very courteous and helpful. My sister and I enjoyed our vegetarian soups very much. I suggest you to use Groupon to get a good deal. I definitely will go back!< /Text>

Stepped into the store for 10 minutes and no one talked to me at all until I tried to call the waitress for 3 times. It seems like there are a couple boss and one waitress only. Wife seems like she has her own attitude. Not even smile at all. Waited another 15 minutes to get seated. 10 minutes to order and 5 minutes to get food. Shabu was so so, very simple soup base. Meat and vegetable portion is small, half full only.</review>

< review>
First off I love Shabu Shabu; grew up eating it and grew to love the food more and more as I try different toppings and flavors! This place first hand is neat and clean very freindly place and nice servers! Even though they asked me if it was my first time being there they were happy enough to guide me again and show us how to properly eat and add toppings for more enjoyable experience!

The food was great! Very delicious and flavorful! The fact that they suggest what goes with what and adding those tiny flavors add more taste to the food! I'd definitely comeback here l! It's well worth it!!

This is a great place for lunch.  They give you a big meal of some meat and also noodes to eat with your broth when you're finished cooking the meat (to make sure none of the meal goes to waste--what a great idea!).  The lady who is normally there is very nice and always remember her customers.  Each of the staff is always helpful when cooking your meal.<//review>

I love the different varieties of broths they offer. I have been to other Shabu Shabu places and thought they will be all the same. I always end up comparing it to this place and Regretting not coming here instead.</Text>

Food was expensive, they skimp on the meat and broth was subpar. They charge for everything including $6 for sharing even though there is no difference in the amount of food and other places dont charge for that and additional $2 for different broth which wasn't that great and lady was snooty with me when I asked her questions about menu being that it was my first time there.</text>

I'm a big fan of shabu shabu and this place is just OK. ($20- $17 for a large order) When you come in you choose the kind of broth you want, the meat you want and size.  Pretty standard. The amount and variety of veggies they offer leave alot to be desired. Cabbage, bok choy, 2 small pieces of carrot and 2 small broccoli florets... THATS IT?! No mushrooms? Which you normally get shiitake and enokitake. No nori or green onions for flavor.  You do get noodles and 2 pieces of tofu but again the serving is significantly smaller than in other places.
Overall shabu shabu is a fun experience so the visit was fine. The service wad really nice and the place is spotless and we'll kept. As far as flavor and quality you're better off going down the street to shabu shabu house (also on convoy) way more flavorful and better veggie servings and variety (also a bit cheaper)< /review>

We’ve been eating at Anajak Thai for over 34 years! Ricky’s recipes are authentic with  a homemade flavor. Highly recommend their family restaurant!  Cindy, Ricky and now their son Justin are the best hosts serving the most delicious Thai food.< /Text>

<Review>I have to give 2 stars, which is rare. I don't like being mean but this was not good. The food isn't the worst but the drunken noodles are definitely to be avoided. I don't know why it's thought of as ok to serve greasy noodles here in LA but Thai noodles are light. They use peanut and coconut oils, not greasy canola. Corner cutting. Made me sick, I'm up at 6am writing this cause I couldn't sleep. My stomach...

The garden rolls were also very very greasy. So much grease. Why? And who, I mean who charges $20 for a curry and didn't give you a side of .50 cents worth of rice?! With a curry? I mean.... As a the owner of a food truck I'd never risk my quality to save a buck.< /Review>< Name>

<text>This place is so delicious and FUN! It's not meant for a quiet date night but the food is amazing! And expect a wait.I've tried a few different things but my absolute favorites are the Tamarind Chicken and the 24 Hour Beef Noodle Soup!The chicken is crunchy, full of flavor and filling! It's the perfect amount of sweetness. The Noodle Soup will run you about $28 bucks but it's so worth it! It's rich, flavorful, filling and comforting. I love it so much I have it delivered on cold nights.< /text>< pictures>

TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE customer service!!! I call this place 3 times in 15 minutes in order to place a “pickup order”, no one picked up the phone despite being marked as “open”. I drive 30 minutes to place my order onsite, to be told “it’s 1hr waiting time!” I told them to go pound dirt! Don’t waste your time there!!< /review>

<Review>Rating based on only one visit. I'm no expert on Thai food but I really liked the chicken pad Thai which had egg and fresh lime/cilantro/sprouts on top. The flavors seemed natural and the texture not too sticky. I asked for some jalapeños because I like things a bit spicy. I ate by myself and there were three other single customers who also came in to eat alone. It seemed like they had an established base of returning customers; one was known by name and another knew right away what he wanted to order. Portion size was not your typical big American plate, so I was left wanting a little more (but that's probably a good thing since we're almost all overeating). Customer service was good.</Review><UserId.>100222102113352054014</UserId.><Name>Co Coreanita<//Name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5kuutHQb1UiZao-BO9BacdOangFHL9_NOq9CA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Time>1499287754977< /Time></record></dataset><record>

For example, I was told that they could not leave out the fish sauce in the pad Thai to make it vegan. So if you are a vegan foodie like myself you may want to skip this place.

<review>My girlfriend and I are picky when it comes to thai restaurants. We have been long time fans of Night+Market and only went there for thai until we moved and were just as close to Anajak. ANAJAK IS GREAT! Now we only have 2 places we will go for thai food. We never have any doubts about this place always being above exceptional and amazing. The staff is extremely friendly too which puts them at the top of our list.</review>< user>

Justin (not sure his role at the restaurant, but I'm thinking he comes up w/ the menu) was so friendly & the 6 hr braised beef was out of this world.  No seriously, my boyfriend is rarely impressed by anything, but he was blown away by this dish & the pork satay.  Definitely going back!< /Text></record>

Anjak is on the GREATEST places to eat in the San Fernando Valley, for several reasons that I will be happy to explain...
1.) The food is always fresh and delicious
2.) The family that runs this restaurant cooks with their heart and soul and you can taste it in the food.
3.)They are willing and able to modify almost any dish to serve the needs of the customer without compromising the quality of the food.
4.) Their catering is amazing! They have catered at least 4 giant events for my family and every time, people are blown away by what they taste.
5.) The staff is warm and generous and you feel like to have come home when you enter the restaurant.
Do yourself a favor and eat at Anjak Thai! We love the owners and their whole family!!!!</text>

No. Just no. The decor is great, but the food is AWFUL. The most bland Pad Thai I have ever had in my life. No spice, and some sad little tofu strips to compliment the lukewarm food. My friend had the curry, which came with soggy tofu that fell apart before even touching it. No veggies with the curry and it costs $3 extra for rice. You can’t eat a curry without rice, so I don’t know who they think is eating curry with no rice. And the service is terrible. They don’t bother to check on your meal until the check. Don’t listen to the reviews. Any other place is better.</Review>

TLDR; Food: Some good some bad. Service: An embarrassed server tried really hard to make up for moderately rude hostess. Ambiance: Meh.

Showed up early on a weekend, found the restaurant about half full. Had no reservations, and were curtly told that we couldn't be seated without one.  It should be noted that a couple of the tables had a "reserved" plackard on them, but most empty tables did NOT. After pressing about the number of empty tables, the hostess said she would check, walked away and proceeded to ignore us.  A couple minutes later, a server came by and asked if we had a reservation (!?!?).  We explained that the hostess, who was standing at the bar looking at her phone, was supposed to be checking if we could be seated.  He walked over to her and "asked" but came back very quickly and reiterated that they couldn't seat us without a reservation. While he was checking, we whipped out the phone and found MULTIPLE reservation periods available as soon as 30 minutes in the future (minimum amount of time that Open Table will show).  30 minutes later, we were seated WITH our reservation.

We ordered a few dishes, none of them were stunning, and one was half inedible. Half? Yes, half.  We ordered the braised beef which came with two small pieces of beef.  One was nice, tender, and beautifully cooked.  The other was dry, and over-cooked and not edible.

The ambiance was ok.  It was unremarkable, neither beautiful nor unappetizing.</Text>

<text>This is a very nice Thai restaurant in the heart of Sherman Oaks.  We would frequent this for lunch and every once in a while dinner.  I liked that it was more of a sit down restaurant than a take out place.

Their food is flavorful and they have been around forever so you know that they are a solid restaurant given the typical turn over for this area.< /text><rate>4< /rate><gmap_id>0x80c297c5baa1e89f:0x83a04faba786ac13<//gmap_id><user_id>100206180131731784292<//user_id><user_name>Dawn Martin< /user_name><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

{'time': 1483389399243, 'text': "Hi Steve, thanks for your review. My name is Justin, I'm the son of the original owner Ricky, who you may have met during your lunch. Our apologies that you didn't have a great experience at our restaurant. If my pad thai or garlic beef was just okay, I'd be upset too. My father, who is the chef is half Chinese half Thai, which seems like you picked up on through the food- would like for you to come try us again.\n\nIf you'd be comfortable giving us your address, we'd love to send you a gift card in the amount of your last lunch meal. Just let us know how much that is, if you wouldn't mind giving us another chance :)\n\nFor dinner, try our Green papaya salad, our Tamarind-glazed wings, our pork satay, Masamman Brisket, or our Chili-soft shell crab. These are the more authentic dishes I'm proud to serve.\n\nHave a happy new year and send us your info!\n-Justin from Anajak"}</resp>

<UserId.>113669553636359461479< /UserId.><review>I went here two times for lunch. The first time I had their house special chicken. The second time I tried the garlic beef with pad thai noodles, which came with an appetizer egg drop-like soup. Overall, the food is nothing spectacular. Like Talesai in Studio City, Anajak Thai's food is pretty Americanized, thus it's not really authentic tasting like Krua Thai, Sanumluang and Hollywood Thai. At times, the food even has that sense of a typical Americanized Chinese restaurant taste and vibe. Their house special chicken was pretty good, although their pad thai was a bit bland, their garlic beef was okay, and their soup a bit on the bland side as well.

In conclusion, this is an edible place to eat if you're in the area looking for a quick lunch bite. But don't drive out of your way to come here. There are so many other better Thai restaurants in LA. Unfortunately, Ventura Boulevard doesn't have too many great Thai restaurants.</review></record></dataset><record>

I was hungry for some Thai food and was in the neighborhood. This place came up on Google search as 5 star joint. Let me tell you it is far from it. As i walked in to this place first thing came to my attantion is dirty stained carpet. An older man came out to seat me at my table. I ordered soup and brown rice. As he was geting my order ready, he cought my attantion by continues  coughing. As he was bringing my order he continued on coughing over my food without turnig away or covering his mouth. I could not accept this kind of service. I had to get up and leave this place. This is not a 5 star joint.  I can not rate the food there only because I would not eat contaminated food.  I would never recomend this restaurant to anyone.<//text>

<Text>This is the BEST Thai food, I have ever eaten! The owner and his wife are gems, and this place has become a special treat for my husband, Dan, and I. We love the following dishes the BEST:
1) To start the Potstickers and the Shrimp Supreme are favs! That special sauce that is prepared for the Shrimp Supreme, is amazing!
2) Entrees, the Anajak Thai Chicken gives you an amazing combination of cashews with chilis and you can ask for only white meat (fore a mere $2 extra), worth it if you like chicken breast.
The Panang Curry with Shrimp and Roti, is just amazing. Chef Ricky really know the balance between the sauce shrimp, and dipping the roti into the sauce is a treat.
Dan loves the Summer Noodles, and the Lad Na, and alternates between the two every time we go. Both are mouth-watering, and sometimes, we opt for the Summer Noodles, or the Pad Thai, really, they are all amazing.
3) Dessert - Lychee fruit with pineapple. Very light, cleanses the palate, and sets you up for the rest of the night.
Hope you go by and enjoy, you won't regret it!</Text><UserId.>115774122136280374218<//UserId.>< user_name>

(Translated by Google) Salty chicken fried with water batter on sticky sticky rice!!
The chicken is moist and the chicken parts are evenly distributed one by one.
It is a simple mechanism, but the combination is the best!!
The two sauces that are served together here give you a new taste in between.
At the moment when you want to give up because you are dominated by the greasiness of chicken
Makes me forget my memories!!

(Original)
쫀득한 찹쌀밥에 물반죽으로 튀긴 짭짤한 치킨!!
치킨은 촉촉하고 닭에 부위도 하나씩 골고루 들어있다.
단순한 메구성이지만 서로간에 조합은 최고다!!
여기에 같이 제공되는 2가지 소스는 중간중간 새로운 맛을
제공하여 치킨에 느끼함에 지배되어 포기하려는 그 순간에
기억을 잊게 만들어 준다!!<//Review>

Luckily, there are some chairs and tables located outside for you to sit in.  If there are a couple of people in front of you while you wait in line, there is a good chance that you are either at the door or holding the door open.  However, as is with all Jamba Juice's, they have good tasting smoothies - but I don't recommend anything from their "light" section since it tastes nothing like their regular ones.</review><Resp>None<//Resp><Rate>3< /Rate><name>Jorge Trujillo</name>< Time>

It takes a lot for me to leave a 1 star review on a business, but I feel it is warranted in this case. Jamba Juice advertises fresh pressed juice and charges an arm and a leg for it. Understandable, as pressed juice requires a lot of material to produce even a 16oz cups worth. I paid almost $8 for 16oz. The girl began by pressing some apples, good start... but then to that added scoops of what appeared to be canned, crushed pineapple and a small handful of spinach to it and then blended it... like in a blender. It was served to me like that, and I only got about 3 sips out of it before it all turned to thick pulp i couldn't get through the straw. I can go to Blender in the Grass and pay less for actual pressed juice. I don't know if this is common practice for all Jamba Juice locations, but it's false advertising and shows that this is a company that doesn't really care about quality as long as they save a few bucks.< /review>

<Text>Very rude staff, I stood there for about 10 mins. listening to some young girl with colored eyes talking to another girl trying to work about all the drama in her life, only for her to look at me ask if i was ready and then continue to talk before i could even respond to her question and give her my order. Rude, loud and obnoxious. Thank you Jenny for the horrid service.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>all of my experiences here have been so good until today when the girl had to make my smoothies 2 times and still didn’t get it right. i ordered two peanut butter moods and the first ones were runny and had all chocolate no peanut butter and the second round was not runny but still had no peanut butter.</Text>< response>

<text>I brought my mother to this clinic for blood tests a couple weeks ago & came back to see the results. Unfortunetly, I couldn't get off work early enough to go with her but would pick her up after. My mother had the appointment scheduled at 7pm & arrived at 630pm. From our previous experience they denied to see her because she was a couple of minutes late so she made sure she got there 30 minutes early. They did not assist her until 730pm. Which I thought was unfair since the previous time she was only 15 mins late & they denied to see her. Nonetheless she got seen by the doctor & was charged another doctor's visit only for the doctor to read the results of the blood test off a piece of paper. Which I thought was completely unfair, I could've easily just asked for her records & had my doctor read it or research what it was. But anyways after they read her results they tell her she needs 3 shots. One of them being for the flu. I was so upset when I found out they told her to get one & pay for it when flu season is over. On top of that she got extremely sick the next day with the flu. So she basically paid just to get sick. But my biggest complaint is probably the three receptionists behind the counter. I arrived at 730pm and waited for my mother until 830pm. I was sitting with another gentlemen in the lobby waiting for my mother & he was waiting for a family member. One of the receptionists comes in & asks us are we waiting for someone. We both responded "yes". 30 minutes pass & I am now the only one waiting in the lobby. The 1st receptionists is sitting at the front desk on a computer & then another one comes in. She talks to the girl on the computer and I hear them talking about me. Then she asks me the question again, "are you waiting for someone?" I look at the receptionist on the computer in the eyes & say, "yes, she already asked me that." Then they look at each other & both sit down. One of them leaves & comes back with I believe the supervisor & she looks at me & asks me again, "hi are you waiting for someone? Do you want to go inside & sit with your mom?" At this point I am annoyed & realize that it is their closing time but don't understand why they keep pressing me when I told them at least twice that I am waiting for someone. So I responded in a very sassy manner, "yes I already told all of you I am waiting for someone and is there a problem with me sitting here? Like what's the problem? Can i not sit here?" They all looked shocked & said, "oh no no it's fine." Then sit down & start whispering amongst themselves. At this point I am getting irritated because they're making such a big deal about me sitting in the lobby. I couldn't hear what they were saying but it was making me very uncomfortable. Finally my mother comes out & I hear her bickering with the supervisor saying that the supervisor was attempting to write her a referral for an exam that the doctor never recommended. I could hear them from the other side of the lobby & she spent at least 15 minutes trying to give her this referral when she didn't need. My mother kept telling her that it's not what the doctor said but she refused to listen & said since the doctor left that she would call her back to let her know. Till this day we have still not received any communication about what the doctor said. My mom instead of arguing with her left with me & we could hear them laughing as we were leaving. I am never taking my mother to this establishment again & I advise that if you do come here please be assertive & ask a lot of questions. Off of this interaction I could tell there was no communication between the doctors & his nurses/receptionists. Medical visits are expensive & for the doctor to say she doesn't need it but then the nurse/receptionists to say she does, is confusing & can be a waste of money. Not only that but the service here was trash, why were they so concerned with me sitting in the lobby? Is that not what it is for? & if it is because they were trying to go home & close they really need to work on their customer service.</text>< date>

Clinicas Del Camino Real Inc, on Clara Street in Oxnard is an outstanding clinic. Dr Khatib is the best pediatrician in California, and his nurses and staff are excellent. They work hard to keep children (my child in my case) in good health, and Clinicas is always available to take good care of medical needs. Dr Khatib and his staff put their heart into their work, and they are very intelligent and practical and caring. Clinicas deserves the praise of parents, and Clinicas definitely has my appreciation. And my family has been a customer at Clinicas for 6 years now and ongoing. Thanks Clinicas on Clara Street in Oxnard! Today is Tuesday, July 16, 2019. :-)</review>

This company has a lot of clinics.  The one I like a lot is Clinica Maravilla which is located on Clara St., in Port Hueneme, Ca. This clinic does not have a problem checking various ailments you might have.  They don't have you make an appointment for every single thing that bothers you.  Secondly they will call you to reschedule if you missed your appointment.  The reason I didn't give them five stars because they have this habit of checking your address and phone number every time you call or they call.  So if you call, visit or they call they ask over and over. This gets annoying when you go in once a week. Another thing, they used to remind you of your upcoming appointment via text message and they removed it. So I am not happy about those two things.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service every time I make an appointment for physical check-up of my daughters the day before the appointment I was tired because the doctor will not be a single doctor for the entire clinic.

(Original)
Muy pesimo servicio cada que pongo cita para chequeo físico de mis hijas un dia antes de la cita me canselaron porque el doctor no estara sera un solo doctor para toda la clinica  pesimo servicio.<//review>

<review>Cute small park for pre schoolers with a small parking lot for a few cars. Small skateboarding area were I've seen mostly adults skate. Great classes offered for the community at fair and low prices. They also offer a wonderful preschool program for 3-5year olds, free health fair in September, music classes and dance. Nice teachers who care about the students. I would highly recommend this preschool, my son loved it! The director is sooo nice too :) I also love that you can sign up for emails for up coming events.<//review><GmapID>0x80c29733d2c01433:0x6c331a819e924e72< /GmapID><UserId.>112294777080438789604< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>I want to start off by saying, I am very happy that I was even able to get my son seen by a dentist.... So I understand the pandemic is in effect, however, it took me a whole hour to be called 😤 by that time my son was getting pretty fed up. When we finally got called in, the RDA did not introduce himself, but was VERY NICE. My son was very well behaved ( which is shocking) for the RDA and then a random woman came into the cubicle and told me no video taping is allowed (because I had my phone on my hands she just assumed I was taping when I wasn't and I told her that) and looked very briefly at his teeth and left. She NEVER said hello to my son yet not even introduce HERSELF either!! I'm not happy with that at all. No manners at all!! I understand it's very busy, but be professionals! I'm not too sure if I will be returning</text>< pictures>

The receptionist who checked us in at the front was extremely polite. (The one allowing patients to come in and out of the facility) Prior to checking us in, she kindly noted that one only parent allowed due to covid precautions, and what I thought was appropriate was asking if she may take our temperature even though it was protocol.

Moving on in.. the front desk who verified our insurance was quick and efficient! Upon being brought back to be examine by the dentist.

That dental assistant who had us signed papers for consent and who was assisting the doctor was horrible in the first exam room. She was rude, and invaded my privacy. She asked my son not to take any photos (which he didn’t, he was playing games) than proceeded to look over his shoulders and touched our personal belongings swiping left to right as if the phone was hers assuming he had taken photos. Red flag.  After touching our phone she proceeded to say no pictures of staff when she didn’t find anything. No apologies no nothing. Rude!!!!!!!

DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING THAT DOESNT BELONG YOU OR PERTAIN TO YOUR JOB . any patients belonging, do not put your fingers and better yet swipe our phones for us. I thought that was extremely unethical . Assuming she was trying to blame him for photographing staff which clearly wasn’t the issue .

The 1 year old slipped out of the chair so I had ask my son to help me grab the baby, and she directed my son to have a seat with fingers pointing, awful , at this time she should thank him for making her job easier. Again some people should not be in a kids /pediatric facility if they do not have any patience’s or tolerance for the young ones. (Yes we can see you rolling your eyes)

The doctor was very pleasant! He was quick efficient and got the ball rolling. He referred the baby over to get a quick procedure done and from there every one was pleasant! The next physician who gave her a fill did it in less than 10 mins along with the dental hygienists who was his sidekick ! Over all pleasant experience besides that one assistant who was having a rough day.</Text></record>

My daughter had to have 3 cavities filled  and he did an amazing job, beyond my expectations. My daughter has experienced trauma from about her office he understood and took a second to make her feel comfortable and listened to her. They also allow the parents to be in the office while the procedure is being done .< /Review>< GmapID>

As soon as getting their I was greeted and seated right away. Also they were calling people in very quickly and very nice caring staff. I was so scared to try a new dentist for my son because I know he's terrified of the dentist but they made him feel so comfortable and very welcoming .

<Review>Always a great experience and Children's Dental Fun Zone. My 8 year old got treatment today and they did a fantastic job. She cried a little bit because of the shot to numb her but they were very compassionate and understanding. They really know how to deal with the children. I highly recommend this place especially for the younger ages.<//Review>< Rating>

I don’t want to be negative but the past couple of visits were not the greatest. I didn’t have a problem with the staff. They were all nice. The problem is the checking in. They send the forms to you over the phone. That would be ok but it kept disappearing. Then I had to start over.  I was not allowed in until the forms were completed. That took a half hour.  Maybe it would be so bad but I have problems standing for to long. Last time it was over 100 degrees. I was told if I sat in my car I would lose my appointment. I end up in so much pain and feeling angry because I’m in pain.</Text>

My daughters absolutely love this place! They never cry when we go in and Dr. Chan and his team are the greatest at making sure my child is feeling confortable at all times during the procedure. I honestly, love the staff and girls who work in the front. I had to go in as an emergency appointment and Victoria was kind enough to assist and answer all of my questions and get me the assistance I needed. It feels good to get that type of customer service, it makes anyone want to come back. Thanks again</text>

<Review>The staff was nice , however i didnt appreciate the way they kept referring to the “added costs” or how “expensive” certain procedures cost..... my son was in pain and i Didn’t want or expect his care to be hindered because of what assumptions they made when it came to my pocketbook. Other than that our experience wasnt pretty good .</Review>< Pictures>

I had the worst experience! They treated my daughter like a dog! The front staff was nice but, it went down hill from there. When it was time to extract a tooth they had no patience with my 6year old! She was terrified and doctor didn’t comfort her at all. They held her down and extracted the tooth. They didn’t talk her through it or try to make her feel better. My daughter was traumatized to go back to any dentist after that! Worst place to take your kids! !</text>

< Review>
I'd usual give dental fun zone a five star rating but I had some concerns with their covid practices today. on all for safety but there were certain things that they did that did not add up.
Honestly they are great with my kids and very helpful. They do good dental work. I just think they need to reconsider their covid practices. For instance what about single mothers/father's who cannot leave their children with anyone? Are they supposed to leave their children  outside or in a car unsupervised to take one child to the dentist? Finding childcare is not easy. No paper and pencil forms. What about those who do not have smart phones or do not have emails? I know that those are very few but if I can't fill out a form online or in my phone how do I get into your office? You told one person that you could not hand them poem and paper due to covid but then you asked the same person to hand you their phone to take a picture of a link which just nabs that you're passing from phone to phone. Little inconsistencies with covid protocol can cause an outbreak.
Again great dental service but poor covid protocol..<//Review>

The service is absolutely excellent, from the initial phone call from Cathy, explaining the online forms to be filled out & greet at the door, to check our temperature before entering. She also kept all seating clean for everyone. No matter how many patients came, everyone didn’t have to wait long before getting called in. Definitely complete online forms, before coming so that you have everything ready to go at the time of your appointment. Social distancing spaces available for parent & kids. My grandson loved the fish tank. X-Ray technician was very attentive, he made my grandson feel at ease & exam went pretty smoothly. Sam was really nice, & another gentleman that was going around checking patients adjusted my grandsons seat. I thought that was really nice. Thank you! Valerie for explaining everything to me in detail. World class service for kids. I’d definitely recommend bringing your children here. Although I didn’t get everyone’s names, Thank you for making this a good experience for my grandson. Will see you soon for his appointment. Looking forward to it.<//review>

<Text>Everyone was very caring, polite, and professional. My child had a lot of treatment, the Doctor and her assistants were very fast and talk to my child the whole way through, making sure he was okay. I definitely recommend this Dentistry for small children. Office is clean and although it is a very busy, I didn’t have to wait a long to be called in the back.< /Text>< pictures>

I never like leaving bad reviews on businesses. I always believe and do my very best to be kind to any businesses but today wasn't one of them. Today my 4 year old had her first silver crowns put in. I didn't take her to her appointment. I asked my husband take my daughter because he has a more calm energy. I was scared and I didn't want my daughter to feed of my energy. A week before today's appointment I signed paperwork that I DO NOT WANT MY DAUGHTER TO BE STRAPPED DOWN. I was told that they will give her some laughing gas to relax her than they will numb her gum. BUT WHEN MY HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER WALKED INTO THE PRIVATE ROOM THEY HAVE THE STRAP LAID OUT THE MOMENT MY DAUGHTER SAY IT SHE STARTED CRYING AND DID NOT WANT TO LET GO OF MY HUSBAND.
There is also some BLOOD on my daughter's dress. I DIDN'T WANT MY DAUGHTER TO HAVE A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH DENTIST BECAUSE GOING TO SEE A DENTIST IS A LIFE TIME THING. THE LAST THING I WANT IS FOR MY DAUGHTER TO BE AFRAID OF THE DENTIST.
The Indian dentist that generally see all the patients aren't that friendly. She doesn't take the time to talk or try to get to know us. She always makes me feel like I am bad mother for my daughter's oral hygiene. We brush her teeth twice a day.
I will looking for a different children dentist.</Review>

<text>My son is on the spectrum and the staff was very good with him. He actually came come quite confident about his teeth. His brother also enjoyed the dentist. The Dr let me ask as many questions as I wanted and I didn't feel rushed even though they were busy. We wore a mask the whole time. The staff cleaned A LOT and were very professional. See y'all in 6 months</text><GmapID>0x80c3284b2203c767:0xc06f85dd04a3082e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Awesome my son got all his dental treatments done in one visit, when at other dental office he would not sit still for X-rays or cleaning! The dentist and his assistant was great they were patient and made my son at ease! My son didn’t want to leave the dental chair........thanks for making our visit stress free for both of us!!!!!</Text>

First time visiting this dentist office!! I had an amazing experience!! My kids are not fans of going to the dentist and this was the first time they actually let them do x-rays and procedure. The staff were so amazing with my kids. My kids finally found the perfect dentist office!!< /Text>

I could not be more happier with this office and staff. I actually came here last minute because my son had pending dental work done at Happy Teeth in La Mirada.  I was already kinda uncomfortable with happy teeth due to them almost losing my sons tooth during a procedure and strapping the nose thing so tight on my son it left a horrible indention, even though my son was complaining about being uncomfortable.I called Happy Teeth to see if they could help me before my sons procedure because financially its been hard due to my job loss due to COVID.  Happy teeth did not want to help me and even cancelled my appointment because of it!
I was so upset because my son was getting an infection. And they staff did not want to help me at all!! Not even the management! I called Children's Dental fun zone last min because I didn't know what to do. They set me up with an immediate appointment and my son was so happy when it was over because he said they were nice and not mean like the last doctor in Happy teeths office. Thank you Dental fun zone. I wish I could rate a 10 star!!! Thank you to everyone trying to keep my son calm throughout the process.< /text>

Their office was extremely clean and staff wiped everything down before and after to ensure sterility. I was more nervous than my son was and the dentist was amazingly reassuring to us both. He was able to get laughing gas to calm him down. He did not even realize they gave him a shot or pulled his tooth.

The only thing I would change at this dental office is the volume on the television/DVDs they are playing in the waiting room and at each individual cubicle where all the patients are being seen. The parent / Guardians stool where they sit while their child is being worked on is right underneath the television and it is so loud you cannot even understand the hygienist/ dentist as far as what theyre saying under their masks. I have to ask them to continually repeat that are saying.
Other than at a very good experience today's visit was very efficient, nice and cool in there and everybody following covid procedures!</text>

<review>I Haven’t got my sons treatment yet so I can’t speak on that but everyone was really nice and super informative about our treatment plan.
My son is obsessed with the little toy that the woman gave him. My son is two and he’s never been to the dentist, this location made being there tolerable especially with COVID safety measures. I’m hoping it’s smooth sailing for when he gets his work done but I’m sure the staff is used to kids not being cooperative. Im scared and a little excited for the outcome. :) pray for us.</review>< user_id>

I took my daughter here for treatment and the dental assistants were aggressive and rude and just plain mean. My daughter of course was scared to get in the chair and refusing and they yanked her and ended up leaving bruises on her arm. If you feel the need to hurt a child then you’re in the wrong line of business. When a child is not complacent to the point that you want to hold them down then you need to offer to reschedule not try to “win”. They have no patience they just want to get you in and out and move onto the next patient to traumatize.

I am disgusted with these monsters and will be taking further actions to right this wrong.< /text><time>1592496725694< /time></record>

Today was both my kids first time there thanks to our friend who works there for referring us. Facility is big and very clean. The set up is extremely kid friendly, and the staff is very nice! They treat the children as their own, and make them feel very comfortable. The doctors are very informative and they make the entire process so smooth but most importantly they make the kids feel at ease. Definitely found our new family dentist.<//review>

<Review>While the staff was courteous, some of the new Covid-19 precaution kinks need to be worked out. My daughter’s temp was checked at the door. She waited more than an hour to find out that they were skipping her because they didn’t have her temperature recorded. Hopefully this will be a learning opportunity for the staff. She just turned 18 last week. She was trying to fly solo with this appointment. I know she definitely learned how to handle a situation such as this with decorum.<//Review><Date>1592141357030<//Date><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

<Text>Overall it was good and they made my son calm down. One particular receptionist charged Me because she said the insurance only covered cleaning and regular check ups.

The only bad thing I experienced at  the visit was that the instructions given when appointment was made they do not follow them. I was asked to text them when I arrived and wait for them to direct me to go in if a family was inside I had to wait inside my car. I texted but no answer then i saw families lining up like 5-10 mins before my appointment they let them in before me who had been waiting for their response. Other than the above stated staff are nice and quick with their services</text>

I loved the friendliness of some of the staff. The only thing is my daughter has Autism and they told me they would have a private room for her and they didnt even acknowledge that she had Autism. I put it on the paperwork and told the girl I spoke with. I was a little discouraged about that.< /text>

<Text>They have people waiting outside the building. Its ridiculous its supper hot i tried to go in but they kicked me out. They should have somone helping the guest outside asap. Its too hot for us to wait out waited for about 10 mn. They weren't busy at this time. Last time I came  I waited  about 1.5 hour to actually be brought inside. The xray room. At this time there's  about 2 other parents also waiting after me with their childre . I would think everything would be easier since there's less people and less crowded.   Back office  staff vb is always the best!!!  They make my children feel comfortable<//Text>< pictures>

I walked in without an appointment. I waited approx 20min and was informed what the assistant and dentist were doing every step of the way. My son had to get his tooth extracted because his permanent teeth were coming out. I waited another 30min but was warned of the wait time. The doctor was very friendly and was attentive to my son. He was so comfortable that he didn’t even cry! Thanks doctors and dental assistants!<//Text>

So scare, my son was crying because the doctor were doing a treatment, but they were so hurry to finish the treatment that didn't stop and give time to my son to relax and continue doing the job, Even tough he was crying they didn't stop a minute. I feel bad, really miserable with myself after that, but I tought to myself it will be more painful if I come back another day to continue with the treatment. I shouldn't let then do that to my son. I keeped telling them why he was crying and they say because he can't breathe, but even that they didn't stop, and my son told me after the treatment that why it was to hard. That he dont want to come back again. because it was painful to him, they did to much pressure in the treatment. ... really bad experience he cried in my car and told me, mom why that hard treatment I don't want to come here anymore.he is barely 6, and I think that was a torture...I suggest you guys should be more careful when doing treatment to litle ones, treat then as a humans not like robots or machines..I really will think double next time to see if I will do another treatment for my son. Sorry fun zone I wish I would do a better review that I know you guys want honest reviews and I can't say the opposite because didn't happened...and honestly Dr Chaw and nurses are very nice and kind. but maybe they are under pressure  to help another kids.., but their system here is not good. If  is cleaning is fine but treatments I dont reccomended, his filling felt off that's why I brought him back to do another treatment..but too bad ..no no no..I regreat.</text>

I definitely recommend this dentistry for your children. They are very thorough with you and great with the kids. Especially Jennifer! She did an excellent job in helping us set up my sons procedure and even gave my son some toys! Thank you guys for being so helpful and dealing with my crazy kid ! Lol<//text>

I really like the hygienists and dentists here. They are gentle with my kids and speak to them with care. They have movies playing at each chair so kids feel relaxed and can get through their cleanings quickly. On our last visit my 8 yr old had several small cavities (1st time) in between his baby molars and the dentist was very patient with me since I wanted the fillings to be white. We returned for the fillings another day and was very pleased when the doctor said she would attempt the fillings in white as long as my son was cooperative since white fillings are a little more complicated and sensitive to moisture while bonding. He did great and I was very appreciative to this dentist for giving it a try. In the past, I have been denied the opportunity for white fillings for my two other kids at a different dentistal office, simply because it was more complicated and risky because they are young.</text>

<text>Definitely I won't come back at this place. I took my son who is 6 years old and they said he has a cavity and give an appointment.  When I get there for the treatment it was the most terrible experience seen how they torture my kid, they put the anesthesia and not even waiting a minute. They started doing the procedure and my son was screaming like he was feeling a lot of pain.  I ask them to stop and they didn't. Even the gas doesn't work because the mask keeps moving and they don't care about it.  Before I went there I went to another place with my daughter when she was at the same age and I like it better. They wait until the anesthesia and medicines works before they start and was so easy , I ask my daughter if she was feeling pain during the process and she said that she only feel uncomfortable but not pain.  Now I ask my son and he cry when I ask and the answer is yes he feel pain all the time and he says please mom dont let them to hurt me again.  I prefer going back where I feel comfortable taking my kids doesn't matter is far away from me.<//text><user_id>103087024826950788643< /user_id><user_name>Isabel Cardoza< /user_name><Pics>None< /Pics><rate>1<//rate><Gmap_id>0x80c3284b2203c767:0xc06f85dd04a3082e< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Doctor was.so adamant about removing my child tooth, did not specify due to COVID19 they would be only doing certain procedures  seemed like he was not that OK with me not allowing her tooth to be removed. Said somethings  directly to my 8 year old child that I don't deem appropriate.foirst time seeing this dentist there and now will no longer be taking my kids there.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Horrible service during a pandemic. The waiting room was filled as if there was no pandemic going on. They won’t check and treat the same visit so be ready for multiple trips. I will not be returning here with my kids. I should have walked out when I saw the waiting area full.<//review>< user_id>

I like that you are allowed to stay with your kids at all times. They have a theater, big fish tank, and tablets for the kids to play while you are waiting. Wait time is pretty accurate. They also have TVs on the ceiling so your child can watch his or her favorite movie while get work done. They try there hardest to make your child as comfortable as they can.</Review><gmapID>0x80c3284b2203c767:0xc06f85dd04a3082e</gmapID><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

My review is for the dental hygienist Maribel. I cannot rave enough about her. My son was traumatized after he had dental work done on his last visit.  Maribel was extremely patient and placed him at ease by explaining her every step as she worked on him. She is a professional. I'm saddened to hear she is leaving because she is moving out-of-state. She is an amazing hygienist and I am thankful for her patience with my son.<//Review>

<text>Not very happy with services. I've been bringing my children here for a couple of years now but have noticed lots of discrepancies in their billing and misdiagnosis of treatment. I decided to take my son to get a second opinion after I was told he had 3 cavities,  we went today and the new doc found his teeth DID NOT need to filled but found a front tooth may have nerve damage. Beware and make sure you check all paperwork. They almost chatged me 400 for his cavities and he didnt need any of that work.< /text><rating>1< /rating><userid>116935664731414875760< /userid>< date>

Everyone is very nice, I just dont think everything gets cleaned the way it is supposed to.   I just saw an assistant put her visor back on the wall after only wiping it with water and a paper towel. Then wiping the counter with the same paper towel.  These are supposed to be wiped with antiseptic wipes or spray to remove the germs. The shields will have saliva splattered from a patients mouths on them.< /Text>

<review>Why would you pay or allow your Insurance to be billed by these selfless, careless people? Children scream & cry for a reason. It should not be like that don't you see it? My son had an enormous work & bill for something that was not Really needed. Now 3 yes later we're paying for there Ambition. Stay away find a Real Dentist. I wish I knew what I know now. Believe me they'd be Shut down.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I've been coming here for years now and I never have a bad experience! The nurses are great and easy to talk to. The dentists are really good at reassuring you. I recently had my wisdom teeth removed here as well. The oral surgeon seemed really experienced. I wasn't scared at all.< /Review><time>1483582206070< /time>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Terrible.  Waited over 2 hours while chairs and dentists were both available.  They faked a cavity and did unnecessary procedures.
We have stopped going to this dentist.  They unnecessarily did x-rays every appointment and were not happy when I said no to the x-rays.  They also told me that my daughter had a cavity but could not show it to me.  Later I took her to a different dentist and the new dentist said there was no cavity.  To top it off, they made me wait over two hours (after I complained about the fake cavity) while dentist and chairs were both available.  The dentists just stood there chatting.  If I could give zero stars, I would.</Review>

I love taking my kids here. The staff and Doctors are so patient, friendly, kind to my children and myself. The staff makes sure that I understand any treatment that needs to be done. They also talk to my kids and explain what's going to happen, so they aren't blind sided. I feel as if they treat my kids as their own. I have definitely preferred this place to my friends and family.<//Review>

I would not give any star on them.  My child was in excruciating pain and was crying in pain and it seems like they did not put enough anesthesia on him.  They put a crown on my son on the four corners of his mouth.  They tie him down like a roast pig and would not stuff working on his teeth even if my son was crying in deep pain.  i should have sue them for the pain that my son went through.  I will never come back to this place.  My son was traumatize after the dental visit for life.  They butcher my sons mouth!  :,(  :,(  :,(<//Text>

This dental office is amazing.! They have fun games for the kids to play and a theater room for them to watch movies.! The staff members always greet you nicely and very professionally. The doctors are very nice to the children and spoil them with toys and stickers. My kids enjoy coming in for their check ups. Thank you so much Children's Dental Funzone Team.!< /review>

Love the staff. Everyone is very nice and greets you. Kept clean and the entertainment for the kids is awesome. When my child first went, she was scared but they eased her and helped her not to be scared. Very satisfied with them.</Review>

We have been bringing our daughter to Children's Dental Funzone since she was about 3years old and she has never had a bad experience. She is now 15 1/2 yrs and  had braces here as well. She loves it here and now her little brother comes here too!! He has been coming since he turned 1 and now he is 5years old.
Love the way they treat the kids!!
My kids are never afraid to go to the dentist!!<//review>

First experience with different dentist was horrible.
On a separate visit with a different dentist:
Wonderful staff and dental surgeon, truly cares for her patients and the integrity of work being performed. Dental surgeon practices with highest enthical standards and is completely transparent in procedures and expected outcome. She made sure my daughter was completely comfortable at all times, so patient. My daughter was happy with outcome and procedure following today's visit.<//Review>

I love this dental office for my kids! My child was traumatized with my old office, but with all the toys and games, my child completely forgot he was at a dental office. He got all his work done quick and easy. The staff was nice and informative regarding my childs treatment. I definitely recommend this place. Its big too!<//Review>

DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS HERE.
Very unprofessional, they will bait and switch you, they are for profit not care... And they will torture your children while laughing and talking amongst themselves. My they told me my daughter would be put to sleep and did not then waited till they procedure would begin to tell me it was not covered, the. Proceed to tell me it's an extra $650. Why wasn't I told before we went into the room? Why did they not give the gas a chance to work before they began?? Why were they letting her scream and cry without stopping to make sure she is okay??? Please do not take your children here if you love them and care for their innocence. Please!! Find a different place that accually cares for children.<//Review>

<text>I just love this place. Staff is always nice, my youngest was always scared of the dentist and would never ever let them take a look at her without giving a hard time. Ever since the first time I brought her in to this place, she loved it. They were very patient and caring with her. Place is clean, plus they have ipads, and an activities table at the waiting area for kids to entertain with. There are different kids movies playing throughout the facility and the flat screens are even set up on the roof for children to watch while getting work done. I have nothing but positive things to say about this place.</text>< gmapID>

<Text>It was very bad experience with this dental office...I drove there for nothing...the front office turned us away by saying it was not time for my daughter cleaning yet...she has to wait for 6 months. The first time they said the same and they checked and said 6 months gonna be on 03/13. They offered to make another appointment for next time..I am sorry I WONT GO TO YOUR DENTIST AGAIN EVER. HOW CAN PPL GIVE 5 STARS? UNBELIEVABLE FOR SUCH BAD SERVICE.<//Text>< pics>

My kids are the hardest kids to get to the Dr and or Dentist, But Dental Fun Zone has made them comfortable at the Dentist so now I have no problems with my boys. The wait is never long at all, and they try their best to take care of each and every patient in a timely matter.< /review>

Horrible experience. My child is so fearful of the dentist because of this place. He was scared and was strapped down so they can do the work. We were told he NEEDED the work done on his teeth. (Simple cavity). Never returning again< /Text>

It was my son's first visit.  I was a bit disappointed with some of the staff on how "routinely" his experience was.  I was hoping a child's first visit would have been a bit more special.  The check up was in a large room which was filled with 2 big islands that hold computers (in which case I was not able to see my son's x-rays), and with about 6 dental chairs.  The room was chaotic filled with patients, parents, dental assistants, and dentists.  It was a lot of traffic.  Again, being a first visit I would have hoped for a private room, an option to see my son's x-rays up close, and just a less noisier room.  Now comes the part were I was alarmed.  I paid my $52 copayment, PPO insurance, which I was told included the exam, x-rays, and cleaning.  At the end of the visit I was told my son, may or may not, need two baby root canals and 2 or maybe 3 silver caps on his molars.  Which sounds a bit strange since he is not experiencing any pain, and with that degree of work, I would think he would have problems eating, or bigger problems that would have been brought to our attention.  After reviewing the total costs, I was told I had a balance due from today's visit due to x-rays.  I am now alarmed with the billing at Children's Dental FunZone.  I was told my copayment included the x-rays.  When I questioned why there were additional fees, I was told sometimes Dentist request additional x-rays to get a better view.  In this case, in my son's case, this was not accurate.  My son's x-rays were taken PRIOR to seeing the dentist, and was never asked to retake any. Our visit was simple, pay copayment, x-rays taken, dental exam with dentist.  We did not have two visits to the x-ray room.  At this point, I'm not sure if I feel confident with how they will try to bill us for any other procedures or if any future exams.  The fancy aquarium, theatre room, and free toy didn't impress with the possible extra fees.</review>

I've been taking my son to children's dental fun zone since he was 4 he is now 9 and I've got to say he's not afraid to go to the dentist. My son is now 11 and this is the first time we've had an issue with appointments and procedures< /Review>

The lack of sympathy and patience was extremely disappointing.  I had to remove my son before any work was actually done and yet I was still asked to pay for the anesthesia that the had to use on my son.  It was a complete waste of my time and money and such a traumatizing experience for my poor son.  I would highly recommend for parents to seek elsewhere to bring their children.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Been taking my 3 kids for the past 3 years. Yesterday we got there 10 mins before our appt time and we still had to wait 40 mins just for the x ray! When asked what's the holdup, said only had 1 technician since other was on lunch! I also only saw 1 dentist. It was a very busy afternoon, have so many other staff just sitting/standing around, while the actual people we need working are very limited. I was 15 mins late picking up my other daughter from school, thankfully my sister was able to get her.
I do like how dentist & hygienist are very nice and gentle w my kids.<//Review>

<text>Employees are rude and the environment has changed the last few years. Not the sevice it use to be. After 10 years we ain’t coming back. Doctors are very professional. It’s the new staff that is to busy having conversations instead of taking care of the families coming. Very unfriendly new staff. They suck<//text>< Pics>

I absolutely love Children's Dental Funzone in West Covina. Each visit is pleasant and the staff are so tentative to my daughter's needs, reassuring them that everything is fine. They speak to them and include them with all the work that needs to be done. I really like how clean the facility is as well, and just how friendly the entire staff is. I would highly recommend Children's Dental Funzone to anyone with young children!!!!!< /Review>

I pay for my insurance and when you go here expect to be around a bunch of medi cal patients. Too many workers are not all on the same page ... they tried to charge me 300 dollars for a filling on my sons baby tooth.... got it donw for 140 elsewhere. Do your research here they dont seem to be out for you. Soo many chairs in a big room no privacy and it seems more like a school. Dr sees kids for maybe two minutes then tells you they need it done to thier baby teeth. They hand you off to everyone first you check in then you see someone who seats you then someone takes your xray them someone seats you again then dr sees you then someone else cleans up then someone else tells you how much you owe and more or less attempts to milk you. Requested they provide my childs records and had to go throught the whole chain of command again supervisor was Viri sp be careful id you newd copies get them right away they seem challenged in the simplest tasks like emailing and faxing. You deserve better and i found it.< /text>

WOW very surprized on comments, my daughter has been going to this dentist since she was 3 yrs old. I had never had a problum with them. My daughter is a little question bug and they always answer her question when it come to her, "will this hurt", "how long you been doing this" one thing I like about them is that they take there time with the kids, the waiting area is fun, games and video game to keep there mind off whats coming. The staff I have not had a problum with.
11/2012 my daughter had to have teeth pulled and the Dr. said lets wait till after hoilydays and told her she sould try to losin them herself so he does not have to pull them out, that's what I like about them. They are not about the money and INS claims. So our next appt. 1/2013 saw the Dr. he said OK they are not lose enought we will have to extract, so made an appt for two weeks out, 2/2013, my daughter was very scared at first cause this was major to her, four teeth have to come out,
the staff was very well aware of her needs, they claim her down told her everything that was going to happen, show her the tools and the told her what flavor she would like to smell to help her with the fear. Just to say the visit was a success.
My daughter is 9 yrs old very smart and if she is does not like someting she will let you know, If I don't like something I will let you know, there are very few places I trust my daughter too, and this is one that I can say the comments are maybe people that had a bad day, or just looking for something to complain about.
I will always refer kids here!</Review>

Before coming here i took my 5yo and 2yo to the dental playground in covina and they had a traumatizing experience. it was screaming and crying for help the entire time so i wanted to at lest try and find a more compassionate and friendly dentist. after coming here i found exactly what i was looking for. the waiting area put my kids in wonderful moods. there was a huge aquarium, balloons everywhere, video games, disney movies playing, i was shocked. when it was time to get x-rays and see the dentist both of my kids were so laid back and happy that they didnt care that they had to open their mouths, close them, hold still. they just obeyed without a word of protest. my daughter needed work done and i found the dentist to be warm and friendly. she discussed all my options and told me to call back when i made a decision and they could arrange an appointment from there. she didnt pressure me into making decisions. when it came time to have the work done the dentist and assistant talked to my daughter the entire time to try and put her at ease, and they did the best job i couldve ever hoped for. i highly recommend this place and my children will be going here from now on.</review>

Poor service at front. Reception desk not keeping patients informed if the appointment was changed, we wait for 4 hours to finally seeing the doctor.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The worst place and the most informal.
They make you sign as an emergency even if it is not and they send you to fill out a form by message you arrive at the office and again to fill out papers that the secretary had already done very rude.
How is it already paid to have to put up with it because the money is not returned.
They don't let you comment on their treatment.

(Original)
El peor lugar y el más informal.
Te hacen firmar como emergencia aun que no sea y te mandan llenar una forma por mensaje llegas ala oficina y otra vez a llenar papeles que ya habías hecho la secretaria muy groseras.
Cómo ya esta pagado tener que aguantarla por que el dinero no lo regresan.
No te dejan poner comentarios sobre su trato .</text>

(Translated by Google) I give it 5 stars because they deserve it they do an excellent job though! Sometimes it is not like that one day I had a bad experience when they told my son that !! You do not speak English  ? I do not think
If the person who attended me spoke Spanish
and to finish was the manager O.M.G
What example do you give to the workers saying they attend them well if she does not do her part
The other ladies are a love with the children 😘 and I congratulate them continue like this

y para terminar era la manager O.M.G
Que ejemplo le da a los trabajadores  diciendo atiendanlos bien si ella no pone de su parte
