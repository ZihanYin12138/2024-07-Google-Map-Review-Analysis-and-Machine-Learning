<review>Ordered over the phone to minimize Covid contact and it seemed like they took the order. When I got there they told me I had to wait in line to actually place my order so I left to protect against Covid exposure. There were around 7 customers in the store (and it’s a pretty small store) at that time, so I don’t think they controlled the safety and line into the store very well. Their bagels are decent though.</review>< Pics>

Bagels were perfect as always. Service was standard. NOT a great place to visit if you are COVID-19 afraid or immunocompromised. You have to open the front door, then hand exchange credit cards, customers not wearing masks, ungloved hands touching cup lids, then pour your own coffee. A lot of customer touching.<//Review>

Very rude manager. Bagels were not fresh. Coffee is stale and poorly prepared. But still better than Starbucks next door. Spend the extra mins and miles and go to coffee bean.</Review>

Hated it! They discontinued the garlic bagel... Who does that? So instead i got a soggy plain bagel with what they called "garlic smear," redish gray in color and barely enough to cover over half of the circle.</Review>

I love this place. I have been coming here for over 10 years and have seen it change many times. Even though sometimes there is a wait, the service is always friendly, and the staff is always working hard. I think they get a lot of catering orders which back them up. My favorite is the sesame bagel, it's always soft and fresh. Probably my favorite bagel in town, since they are hard to find!<//Text>

Good bagel sandwiches and the avocado toast is delicious. Of course, Noah is known for their shmears of many flavors. Worth a stop by, there is a Jamba Juice and a Starbucks right next door.

There is a private parking lot with access from Moorpark and the little road behind that comes out from the Janss Mall plaza.<//Text>

Excellent, always fresh bagels and cream cheese. The dozen (your choice) bagels and 2 cream cheeses are a good value at $15.99.</text>

She began to behave pretty nervous and like she was trying to get rid of me and pissed off. Asked for the small coffee at the 1st order station (I double checked on the screen), but at the 2nd pay station they changed it on middle size and charged for middle size, but in fact I got small cup. I didn't check it again before payment. Terrible service and bagels are so so.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I'll never purchase a bagel from here again.  I called in a phone order because I was in a hurry.  Every local competitor (Starbucks & Jamba Juice) not only encourages phone orders to save a wait in line but even has an app to pay for the foods in advance.  Not here.  Despite my calling in advance and speaking to Luis to give him my phone order, the woman at the register said I had to wait in line behind a bunch of other people who had NOT ALREADY placed orders.  THE SERVICE HERE IS TERRIBLE AND NOT VERY FRIENDLY.< /review>

Breakfast like Mom would make it; absolutely delicious. Food is fresh, made to order, and very very tasty. They also serve a fantastic lunch. Service is quick and precise and staff are awesome!! I eat here almost everyday & as long as they're around I will continue to do so. Love this place!<//Review>

The neighborhood loves Tiffany's! I come in here for the smiles and the food. They play the standard dinner dishes so well, and always have the coffee brewing.</review>

This pandora is a mess. Try to avoid at all cost. Went to purchase a valentine gift for my wife. They Made me wait one and a half hours in line with only 5 people in front of me.I would of left but my wife was super adamant in a specific piece she wanted. If possible just order from online store because this Staff is incompetent. I understand that with Covid there's different protocols but it seems like some customers were getting special treatment while others tossed aside. I definitely will not be back. Corporate should really look into rehiring new staff and I'm not the only one that thinks this. Look at recent reviews. Save your self the headache and frustrating find another store or order online.<//review>

<review>My daughter and husband were headed over there for Mother’s Day. I kept calling and calling to try and get a question answered but nope. I never got through. So I sent them to another mall. They lost a $300.00 sale just for not answering their phone. SMH<//review>< Name>

I’ve been a loyal customer of pandora for years now, and I’ll never ever go again after this incident, worst service ever, she wouldn’t give me her name, but a chubby lady was extremely rude, wouldn’t process my return and was yelling at me making me wait outside when she allowed another caucasian woman to step in with her plus one, even though she had made me leave and threatened to call security supposedly because of the 1:1 person ratio, yet allowed a caucasian woman and her daughter in, in front of my face while humiliating me and my daughter, NEVER WILL I EVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM PANDORA AGAIN. They need to reevaluate who they hire.<//Text>

Waited in line for 10 min on black Friday deal.  Employee came out and ask if I knew what I wanted I said no but I wanted to get someone today.  She said that I can't come in and look around at anything due to covid  But than tried hand me a book to look though.  Made no sense that book has probably been touch by so many people SMH.< /text>

Busy have to get on wait list for service. Could use more staff during the holiday rush. Speaking of rush felt rushed when it was our turn. These little trinkets costs too much to wait around for our turn.</text>

<Text>I was very happy with our visit! The pancakes were delicious. They are offering outdoor dining, two tables available. And it seems their is 1 guy doing it all by himself (maybe the owner)! Which is amazing and shows how much they need our support. So please, be patient if you're waiting :) we will definitely be back!< /Text>< pictures>

The pancakes were amazingly fluffy, soft, but not crumbly and topped with fresh strawberries!   Entree portions were very generous. I had the EVERYTHING breakfast which was satiating and healthy. I wish I lived here just to have breakfast every weekend. If you’re visiting, don’t pass this cafe by!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2db37fed3e3b1:0xe728e05bc2a474bc< /Gmap_id></record>

It's amazing the food is delicious the service is great 10/10 would recommend Albert is the best very friendly they have outside dining now.  The smoked salmon salad with avocado and their special honey mustard sauce, French toast and marinara pasta with meatball were all delicious!<//Review>

Came for lunch and we were very happy with the food. They serve breakfast all day and we enjoyed the cheeseburger and the breakfast plate. The presentation of the food matched the great taste. Fries and burger patty with eggs were served with no salt which was perfect for me to add what I like.  The service was very friendly and the location is quaint and clean on the south side of Huntington. We'll be back!< /text>

We stopped in in the middle of an errand, first of all it’s a one man show so please do help out and be considerate!

I ordered a breakfast burrito which was the best I’ve had!!!!! I’d definitely come back for it! My husband ordered the French toast and it was not the greatest and we would’ve appreciated some creamer for coffee.

Definitely willing to come back and try something else< /Review>

This aging institution on Huntington still serves a satisfying breakfast. Those that embrace carbs and gluten will enjoy the crispy french toast with strawberries that's served on Sundays. A little pricey for what you get, but hey, that's San Marino for you. Cash only joint.</Text>

< Review>
Great little restaurant, great service, great new york steak cooked just right at medium  rare. wish it was in my neighborhood. Owner, if you're viewing, will you  be open this year for Christmas? Two of us bachelors ate there for Thanksgiving and we're hoping you're open for Christmas. Any Chance of this if even early or late in the day? please reply asap. Thanks for keeping the place, as you have. Not many coffee shops left anymore which have American food and not just Hispanic or Asian. Voted complete 5 star rating but only shows 4.4. NO, IT'S FIVE STAR!!<//Review>

<text>Great place, as I was having breakfast somebody brought a dog on the tables outside. Was like a border collie mix, extremely educated he begged for food so discreetly, then another dog (a pretentious puddle) was being walk and they say hello.
Border collies were originally breed to herd livestock and they are extremely obedient and intelligent, there was even one who was able to recognize about 200 objects by name, just incredible.
Food was good.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Pricey which I don't mind if I'm getting a great meal. It was OK but not very accommodating.
My wife wanted to substitute a pancake for her hash Browns and pay the difference, but it wasn't possible? Great service and nice environment though. Will I be back yeah? probably give it another chance.< /Text></record>

This is one of the most adorable coffee shops I have ever seen in my life. The owner of this cozy little place, Albert, has always been attentive and friendly towards me. I love the ambience there and the various breakfast dishes I have tried over the course of last few months have been consistently delicious. Personally, I consider this wonderful place a hidden gem in San Marino.<//Text>

<text>This place is way over priced and the service was of disregard!  There was literally more waitresses then patrons and I still didn't get attended to once during my meal or asked if I wanted a refill.   $17+ dollars for some corn beef hash and a coke.  The bill was not line idem so I asked and the waitress said they had a tax increase. Tax increase? What does this mean--are you your own Government?!   All cash restaurant-do you even pay taxes?  San Marino Grill-NEVER AGAIN!!!  ZERO STARS!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Family owned old school American diner, kind of a rare find in the San Gabriel Valley. Ok food, good service and ok prices get a B, mediocre coffee and Sunny Delight-type OJ get a F.
I expected more from a 50+ years old "institution" in upscale San Marino. I will give them another try though, hopefully the beverages are better next time.
so; B + F = 2 stars only (can't give them 2-1/2)</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>First and foremost you get the fifth star for your review responses! Love the honest feedback you give! Anywho, I thought the coffee here was superb, I got their house Brew and it was to perfection! Also got a breakfast sandwich and a almond croissant which went well with the coffee. The staff here was super friendly and when I asked what coffee she would recommend since it was my first time here she didn't hesitate. Love the islander shack feeling this place gives you. I would highly recommend trying this place out, it's also locally owned and locally ran! Can't wait to be back</Review>< Pictures>

We are extremely picky coffee snobs and THIS is amazing coffee! Their thrift store is open during Covid (wear your mask). Social distancing encouraged in patio areas.< /text>

<time>1565625797534< /time><rate>1<//rate><Review>My daughter and I stopped for coffee here yesterday, I had a mocha and my daughter an iced coffee. Both drinks were disgusting. My mocha was made with hot chocolate powder that was stirred in and floating in chunks at the top of the drink. It as lukewarm as well. Really gross.  My daughter asked for sugar free vanilla syrup and was given full sugar syrup. How do we know? She's a Type 1 diabetic and it spiked her blood glucose. That is dangerous! Waste of $8.00. Yucky.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Ordered a drink from here and also from Revolution roasters. We weren’t allowed to sit at “their tables” outside even though we were paying customers the staff especially Olivia was confrontational,  rude and basically were kicking us out so their friends could sit down. We love SouthO and also live here in Oceanside. this is Not neighborly place anymore. Guess were not cool enough 😂< /text>

But, its worth it their coffee is great and taste excellent, always hits the spot and never taste funky with any of their coffee's and expressos. Black coffee even taste good, people watching is fun here too + captain's helm.<//review><Time>1529263761688< /Time></record></dataset><record>

<resp>{'time': 1589324041330, 'text': 'I\'m sorry you see it that way.  I never mean to come across as rude.  I am merely responding with genuine responses to reviews people leave.  We don\'t even have a star wars bathroom. They were confused.  If someone hates their order, it happens, we\'d give a refund.  No problem. But to call something "disgusting" and "really gross" is an opinion.  To have possibly accidentally used the real sugar syrup instead of sugar free is an accident, not a horrible thing to do.  Those kinds of reviews help no one and it\'s people like them that are confident behind a keyboard, yet never would have said it to my face that distort the whole reason for reviews.  You\'re the kind of person that won\'t try a place because of this exact reason.  Not based on a helpful review, or quite frankly the large amount of good reviews we have.   Because you don\'t like how I respond to reviews?  What does that have to do with anything?  (Genuinely wanting to know, not being rude.) I think you should try us.  Then leave a review based on your actual experience.  Not leave a review to a place you\'ve never been.  That\'s rude.'}<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Wasn't sure how to rate this place, 2 stars rates it as "Meh, Experienced Better" seems a little harsh but I have experienced better and 3 stars rates it as A-ok but I didn't think the food was A-ok, it was just Ok. I'm all for supporting local businesses but why claim that it's Estilo Mexico City, when it taste nothing like the street tacos in Mexico City? I should know,  I lived there for a while. Could be more flavorful , that's all.</Text><gmapID>0x54ce47155a9f8167:0xe29b030d40cc6a1b<//gmapID>< Pictures>

Lived there for a year and had to move out. I love my carport apartment. I just had some concerns about safety. I came home one day and my door was open and saw a letter from the office inside my door and my door was open. I left the apartment spic and span just like when i moved in. I didn't get my security deposit and they put me on collection. Some of the people in the leasing office are unfriendly and it was actually rude to open my front door throw the letter and not close it. How crazy is that.<//review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>We have been Lewis Property residents for 3 years. But in the last 2 years, the cost vs. quality has dropped and we had to go, the rent was just too high end for us to continue living there.

In the last 2 years we have lived in the gated community of Homecoming. In this gated community we had a few security concerns. People digging through trash, packages stolen, patio items stolen, cars broken into, and a few friendly skunks (which we actually didn't mind). But nothing life threatening.

If you need to live in the area and can afford it, it's not bad. We just would not move back.

EDIT:
Lewis Management has reached out to us about issues posted in the original review. Though it wasn't the ideal resolution from our point of view, they did work with us to come to a compromise. So I'm editing the review. Thank you for looking into our issues, we do appreciate the extra time spent on the matters.<//text><rate>3< /rate><user>103946830323507395306< /user><Gmap_id>0x80dcca7f007b4c3b:0x8ca79321c66f602b</Gmap_id>< resp>

Save your money! Rent from a complex who’s property management will take the time to call you back, a team who will take your safety and the safety of your children seriously. There is a HUGE rodent issue here. Good luck trying to go on a walk once the sun goes down. Skunks and raccoons are everywhere. Not to mention the insane amount of stray cats and kittens that roam the complex. We definitely will not be renewing our lease here, we can’t wait till it’s up so we can move.</text>

<GmapID>0x80dcca7f007b4c3b:0x8ca79321c66f602b</GmapID><Text>I was extremely disappointed in the way Homecoming at Eastvale does business. When checking out the apartment complex before moving in it seemed really nice, well taken care of, and secure. However while we lived there the mailboxes got broken into, multiple cars/garages were broken into, and people going through the trash dumpsters. The gates are left wide open probably approximately 50% of the time so they really don’t do any good. There was multiple times they got behind on the yard maintenance to the point rose bushes were growing over the entryway to our apartment. We also had our smoke detector go out of service for being outdated and requested new ones. They picked up our old ones but it took a month to get new smoke detectors and the whole time we were without a single smoke detector. For the high price paid on the apartments you would expect better security and service. Also be aware when you move out they will nickel and dime you for carpet cleaning, painting, and general house cleaning so be prepared to not get your security deposit back and possibly owe more. When were moving out we also got about $1,000 charge because we were a few days short of a 30 day notice even though when we were asked at 30 days if we would be renewing for a 4th year we told them we were waiting for escrow to close before we made a final decision and we were told “okay no problem just let us know” but they did not mention the fine print in the contract that if we didn’t give exactly a 30 day notice we would be charged half a month’s rent for being a few days past 30 days.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<time>1544652542223<//time><Text>I have never left a negative review but I feel like this is necessary. This is the worst experience I have ever had in any apartment I’ve lived in. Roach infested, loud music late at night, unprofessional staff, etc. Was lied to from the initial lease signing on a personal matter. Beyond impossible to get a call back or an email response regarding any matter.  They towed my car when my car was registered (registered before I even moved in) with them and someone from the night service staff told me I had nothing to worry about after a ticket I received. I recently moved out and received $1200 in charges. I’ve never seen charges like that from anywhere I have lived so I thought this must be an error. I called, left messages with staff, emailed the manager (Bret) multiple times and I finally got a response back nearly 2 weeks later claiming it was mostly due to pet damages. It took 2 weeks to come up with that? I have never owned a pet, no pet has ever stepped foot inside of my unit and according to the email I received they are unable to adjust the charges. Not to mention, my request for an inspection prior to move out was ignored. Ridiculous that normal wear and tear after living there for only a year is labeled as “pet damages” but they will scam you any way they can.<//Text><Rating>1</Rating><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<Name>M Peacock<//Name><date>1557515881460</date><Rate>1</Rate><review>I cant believe how RUDE these people are at this property! A leasing agent at the homecoming at terra vista called this property told Josh We’d be coming over to view a unit. We get here and he is the nastiest person i have ever dealt with! He tells us he has an appointment coming in, in 15 minutes and he wont show us anything. We explained we only need 5 minutes to view the unit. The other agent explain to him we aren't trying to move in into this specific property, we just want to see the unit. So it would have taken all of 5 minutes to see the unit and he would have another 10 minutes for his appointment to get there. He tells us i am not arguing with you and i cant show you the unit. As he briskly walks away i asked for his name and he doesn't even look at me and mumbled Josh. I follow him to his desk as he’s walking away to get his card so he can be identified. If he is treating a potential residents like this he treats everyone like this and manager obviously allows it! This is incredible unprofessional and he has the absolutely worst customer service ive ever witnessed. From my experience this is a tell, tale sign of how you will be treated if you move in this property.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
Lived in this location for 8yr. It was a great place to live for a while. As time went on the quality of the people selected to live there went down hill. The community started getting a bit “GHETTO” people driving crazy in a 5mph community. Loud music being BLASTED and staffing being very rude.so I  Decided to purchase a home. It was hard moving away because I just rescently got my Drake apartment remodeled with granite counter tops new carpet and wood flooring. But the rent was going up to 2700+. So I jumped ship. Well I just hit my bill and noticed that I was charged for EVERYTHING. When my wife and I left apartment we cleaned it and everything was in a good shape. But I was charged for a brand new carpet and a bunch of cleaning fees. Not only did they take my deposit I also have to oh 500 bucks for their new carpet which wasn’t in bad shape AT ALL when I moved out. I hate doing business this way considering my family made sure we were very careful on any stains on the carpet. I find it unprofessional and damn right crooked what they are doing to us. Obviously I will pay because I need to take care of my credit. But those of you considering to move in, please enjoy the carpet. Because the the previous tenants paid for it for you and it will soon be your turn to do the same.

Recap-
I received an update from the manager Bret. The same manager who kept passing me off to his assistant Toni. It looks good on google review when you reply. Good job covering up your business. But looks can be very deceiving. I called back a couple times and each time neither Bret or Toni were available to take my call. I left behind messages with my number asking for a call back however I never received it. At this point, I have already counted my losses. I did want to point out the message below had no real intention on resolving my issues with homecoming.< /Review>

<name>Teri Hoffman<//name><time>1559487326595</time><rate>1< /rate><Review>While living there was fine, leaving was NOT.  Per our conversation with representative on staff we needed to give a 30 notice upon moving.  It had come up kind of sudden and we were on the last day.  It was asked if we could utilize the night drop box because all parties needed to sign the document that was provided to us. Which we did.  During the month, there was additional verbal communication regarding how we needed to clean the apartment.  We were told we did not need to clean, since upon vacancy the apartment would be slated for remodel.  This was in Nov 2016 and they were changing out carpet to wood floor, new cabinets and countertops.  So we did not clean.
When the keys were being dropped off, the person on staff who looked up our account she seemed surprised and said that we needed to provide a 30 day notice.  We informed her that we did, but this person said there was no record.  Next day we called back and spoke with the manager, he said he would look into it.
Well we were charged for cleaning, as they did not remodel our unit and they had a new tenant within 2 weeks.
After several months of back and forth and several corporate calls, then no return calls from anyone either at the corporate level or local level we heard nothing, either my mail or phone nor return emails.
Now 2 1/2 years later we get a letter from a collection attorney wanting to collect over $1800 in cleaning charges, Pet Scan (we didn't even have any pets) cement cleaning for the patio and lost rent!
BEWARE...get everything in writing and get receipts!  Hard lesson learned.<//Review>< pics>

Horrible design who ever built these and designed the setup of addresses was truly on a good one. Drove around for 25 minutes trying to find an address. None of the addresses are in sequence the place was built by a scatter brain. I would never live in such an unorganized setup.< /Review>

I really like Homecoming at Eastvale Apartments the only complaint I have is the pool & spa close at 10pm & doesn't open until 9am other then that the gym is pretty awesome. Staff is very helpful when it comes to repairs & fixes. Lots of perks & fun stuff to do @ homecoming.

Update 6/22/13 : I have lived here for 2+ years and cant complain safe neighborhood great people club house is great! pools are always clean and maintained! you honestly cant ask for more!< /Text>

<Review>I never really bother with negative reviews but in this case I could help someone not get stuck in a lease they don't want. Let me start off by saying this place is nice as in the housing & amenities but it's the people & management that make this place not worth living in. First of crime here is an ongoing issue that seems to be pushed under the rug so you'll never hear about it so they can keep this place occupied & rent high. Parking here is a big issue people don't follow the rules & they only get enforced one night out of the month & they even announce when they are going to do it so people can follow the rules one night. Residents are only allowed to park their cars inside their garage & one outside unless they pay for another garage or another outside permit sticker. Nobody follows the rules they're people that sublet, bring work vehicles home, or have multiple cars that all park outside without the permit all the time on top of the residents that don't work there's no parking in the afternoon & you'll have to park in far back lots or outside the gated community prone to crime with no eyes in sight. In the back lots people from swan lake jump over & break into cars & even steal gas out of them. The gate doesn't mean anything people that don't have a right to be in the community just wait in the nearby lot or even park right in front of the gate until a resident tries to come in & has to open it sometimes even has to get out of their vehicle so the sensor can detect it. There's rules that don't get enforced so this place is just free for all, they mention all the rules when you're looking to move here so you'd think it's a good place but not when the rules mean nothing. There's no security, swan lake has better security than this place will ever have. There's other communities I'd suggest such as the Lewis property in Chino hills or the new townhomes in Ontario ranch road that have mortgages the same price as it is to rent here. I thought this place was amazing at first but as soon as I moved in you notice the problems & all the residents here say the same thing.

I'd look up the homecoming neighborhood watch page so you can see all the daily crime & issues that don't get resolved.

There is pros to this place which are great if you completely ignore everything else that's going on around you. The maintenance is great & the upkeep of the parks & grass is great. There's parks in a resonareas distance here in the community so they're a little cleaner than outside. There's gas grills everywhere that even get cleaned regularly. The gym has the necessities available 24/7. The homecoming main office has plenty of activities to stay busy. You only really need to leave home to get groceries.

I've heard this place used to be good by residents that have been here for years & they say the new management is a big issue, I'd suggest thinking about this place a year or two from now & maybe things have improved.</Review>< rating>

<user>117560124326030287591<//user><review>DO NOT RECCOMMEND!!

The last two times I visited my mom, a crazy guy was walking around the neighbor hood high on meth following kids around until the cops came 2 hours later.

This morning someone broke into her car infront of her house and not one person said anything.

-No security
-No Cameras
-No freindly neighbors
-KIDS ARE NOT SAFE
- High rent
-Hidden Charges (they wont notify you)
- Tow your car while unloading grocerys infront of you own HOME.

But the managers will confront you if you have to many visitors... implying (holiday family gatherings) and most positive he/she wont reply to this but to the other reviews that are hired bloggers.

Inconsistent, unprofessional, unorganized, and completely useless.

I know what you can do...give my mom back her deposit because shes moving out today! Aug 1st.

DOO NOT MOVE HERE!!</review><Time>1564597213230<//Time>< pics>

If there are 3 to 4 names on the lease they only expect you to use your 2 CAR GARAGE and no other parking which is ridiculous. I understand parking is limited but my family members that live here have 3 cars and my uncles car got towed recently and HIS NAME is on the lease! They do not inform you of this when you are signing the lease. They barely have any lights at night, its basically pitch black and dangerous. For all the money you pay here you would think you could be able to park your car in the parking spots that are provided lol your better off paying WAY LESS somewhere else. Its not worth it</text>< Pics>

<review>I recommend NOONE to live in this place. It constantly smells like cow poop because of the cow pastured's that swarm the outsides of this place. There are cockroaches and bugs horrible. Flies are everywhere. The management is absolutely awful and they towed my own car when I live here!!!!  This place is all around gross. It comes off as a nice upkept environment, but the contact smell of poop and bugs is just too much. Its awful. I will not be renewing my lease.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I have lived at the Eastvale location for 3 months. I have not had a pleasant experience at all. The resident service is no help at all and have lied on multiple of my documents about providing services that they have not given. This company has no regard for how to communicate with their residents in a professional and proper manner. As a new resident I expected to have received more communication on the policy changes that they had rolled out. Here with the Lewis Management it is your responsibility to find the new policy changes and find the information yourself. When I initially signed the lease I was even the information by lessening agent Thalia, that since I will have two cars and a garage that my roommate and my self could switch out the cars in the garage to share the garage rather than purchase another garage that is on the outskirts of the campus. Now I am being given a ticket for parking in the parking lot rather than the garage because my parking pass is green not orange. I do NOT trust this company and would NOT recommend spending your time or money with the deception and inconsistency of the Lewis Apartment Brand.<//text>

Growing up in the city since 04, I thought this place would be a dream to live in, moved in when I was the age to and saw how crappy this place was after seeing how bad staff was, how slow their maintenance was, and how their prices were. Truthfully was a terrible experience here< /Text>

Purchased single item, asked if I could hold it while he scanned the bar code. Dude behind the counter instantly unloaded all his anti pandemic bs on me. I wish I hadn't shopped here. Even with sanatizer and a mask I was nervous for weeks after going here. Clear disregard for safety, sanitation, and customer satisfaction.</Review>

Was not impressed.  Mediocre selection of ipa and stout beers, nothing in the cider or kombucha arena.  Place was empty like a ghost town... and for having such a Primo Pismo spot it's just sad.  Would recommend Vons over this place any day.</text>

The bald older guy that works at night that takes his family to go eat his stinky food there is the worst. If this is the owner he has no respect for his customers. Even though I stay close to him I go to the blue liquor store where they are nice and have great customer service<//Text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>For six years we are there and thought the pad Thai was the best in town.  Something changed recently.  The pad Thai looks and taste like bad pasta dish with no pad Thai resembles.  Sauce is watery/runny as my daughter who lived their food said.  So disappointed as the pad Thai and two small ice Thai tea cost over $31 !!  The Thai ice tea, not only smaller than any other Thai restaurant, was watered down and not good.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
When you're craving Thai and your coworkers are down to buy lunch too! Curry craving was satisfied with the yellow curry and chicken. Beef rib was so tender in fell apart. The papaya salad had just the spice I was looking for. This fed 5 people and we still had food to take home.< /Review>

The extra drive out of the way and the $40+ spent on 2 entrees and an extra rice have now been deemed extremely not worth it.<//Review>< pics>

< review>
Very authentic kosher thai food in the middle of Beverly Hills! Food came out very quick. Small little place, maybe seating for 30 people. Staff was very helpful and they even threw in some speciality drinks free of cost! They have alot of options if you like your food spicy, but they have the option to make it regular if you like!</review>

Expensive but WORTH IT. I ordered Pad Kee Mao & the noodles were definitely house made. Very thick, and almost in pieces, not really long and noodle like, but very good! And the sauce!!! All around amazing.<//review>

<Review>I mean I know that there are fewer options when you are considering eating out when you are kosher. And we came here because my grandmother keeps kosher. But the size or the portions compared to the price was unexpected. Maybe I am just not used to the up charge for having something be kosher... But I didn't expect it to taste so bland either... I expected better tasting Thai that was kosher for that price and if I am being honest maybe a slightly bigger portion.

On another note... The staff is excellent... I mean they are very great.</Review><rating>4</rating><name>B T< /name><Date>1547205086006</Date><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>***NEED TO WORK ON THEIR SERVICE***
Just left this place. 05/02/2019 @ 12:30 pm. Permit parking only or meter parking on the street. The place is small. There were enough tables available for two people to sit at. We ask to eat at a 4 person table seeing that there were two guys also sitting at a 4 person table already eating. The waiter didn't have any problems sitting us at a 4 person table. Then a rude Asian women came out from the back and said, loud enough for us to hear, that the table was for 4 people. We looked at each other and then sat at the table for 2. Instead of giving us menus right away the same waiter SITS DOWN at another table and begins a conversation with the people sitting/eating there. My husband had to ask him for menus after 5 minutes. This place went through different business names and we've eaten at this location many times. We thought we'd try it with the current name...Beverly Hills Thai Kosher . We will never go there again. There are MANY OTHER Thai restaurants that we dine at with superior service...NOT BEVERLY HILLS THAI KOSHER !!! POOR SERVICE. Too bad, we like to support the local small businesses.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b954cf487c07:0xf3c3553b59937ade<//gmap_id>< Resp>

<text>Are negative stars a thing...? The waitress was SO RUDE. Walked in with a party of 5 who were hungry and ready to spend $$$.. however the waitress had an ATTITUDE FROM THE START. She threw our menus in the table. Literally threw them! Didn’t serve us water we asked for.. just put it on the side of the table without saying anything and left. TERRIBLE SERVICE! We left promptly after this. The DISRESPECTFUL ATTITUDE of this restaurant is NOT A PLACE ANYONE SHOULD SPEND A PENNY AT. I’m very disappointed to see this kind of behavior and treatment especially in this part of town. ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE. Would definitely NOT RECOMMEND.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Great Thai food highly recommend it. Try the drunken noodles with chicken! While the restaurant doesn't  serve alcohol, they let you bring your own wine assuming it's mevushal. Fair warning, parking is a pain but that's not the restaurants fault.< /Text>

<user>114954925129440943399</user><Resp>None</Resp><text>WOW! Three words: crying. tiger. beef.
Try it and you won't regret it!

This place has a nicer ambiance than most kosher eateries on Pico, and the service is great. The place is tiny -- it probably fits  less than 40 people at most, so if you come with a group, have a reservation or be prepared to wait a while.

I came with a group of 5 girls and we had the chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce to start, 2 entrees of the crying tiger beef with sticky white rice, pad see ew (pictured), and the thai basil with chicken and rice (pictured). Pad see ew is one of my ultimate favorite thai dishes, or any cuisine for that matter, and this place just didn't do it for me. The noodles were short and thick, almost home-made looking, but not as satisfying. The crying beef was so tender and delicious; there's this citrusy spicy tangy clear sauce that goes on top mmmm mmm mmmmm. That made the dish in my opinion. The thai basil chicken was also very good.

I'll be back!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x80c2b954cf487c07:0xf3c3553b59937ade<//gmapID><Rating>5</Rating><name>Nicole Kohan</name></record></dataset><record>

I went there last week, the food was awful, they let the fat in the meat and the chicken! You don't even see it with the ton of sauce that cover it.
I had more fat than real meat.
I asked to make a new on but it was like I was asking for the moon.
Actually then gave me a new on but it was the same S...!!! Very not professional staff!
Worst thai food ever.
Don't go waste time and money...unless you like junk food !!!!<//Text>

< Review>
The service is pretty slow. I ordered a pizza with estimated time of 15-30 minutes, only to be extended to 45 minutes within 2 minutes after the order was placed.
For a 12" pizza, it was about $25.
The flavor was reasonable, but not worth the 45 minute wait and $25 price tag.</Review>

<Date>1587222960192</Date><text>Our family has dined in once and gotten delivery 5-6 times (over $250 spent patronizing) with Extreme Pizza Hercules and while the pizza tastes great! the menu options are very poor and the corporate and franchise customer service is 1-Star with lots of room for improvement.

Where to begin with the faults of getting delivery and the poor customer service!?:::
•You cannot use coupon codes when ordering online (they’ve been “fixing” this issue for over a year or more!),
•I am missing rewards for several orders over $40-50+ and no customer service exists (corporate or franchise) to resolve this problem,
•I was always receiving email offers, but when I call to place an order they do not see the coupon in their system, and when I asked if the manager can help, the manager has left for the day 🖕🙄

It’s very unfortunate that this place is managed so poorly because, overall, I really like their pizza 💔 now i just feel disgust when i get their emails or see their advertisements 🥴👎

And now, to make matters worse, they are deleting customer’s honest comments from their social media posts (Facebook, etc), and will even block you from leaving any comments at all! The folks here clearly can’t handle the TRUTH! 😮😮😮< /text>< rate>

They give high quality dishes, their menu is rich, The chief cook in that restaurant is a professional, I enjoy very much trying all their food. The food is consistently fresh and tasty, the service towards the clients  is nice. I often go to  this restaurant and I was never discontended. I recommend it to all my friends.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Great service from the owners. 5 stars - Perfect amount of sauce. The sauce tastes excellent! 5 stars - Perfect amount of cheese. Excellent, creamy taste. 5 stars - Perfect! The crust is neither too soft nor too crunchy. It is burnt at the top but not all over the bottom.< /review>

I've tried gluten free pizzas before and it didn't taste good. Yesterday was my first and definitely will not be my last time trying gluten free pizza at extreme pizza. Not only was the service great but the environment was very friendly best part is you can build your pie to your best desire</review>

The calzone was delicious. Ask for the sauce on the side and your crust will stay crispy.<//review>

<Text>This place is great. They more than just  pizza.the have great salads ,sandwiches, and good selection of beers on tap.

I most use delivery which has always on time.but the few time I have been inside the restuarant is clean and the staff is friendly.

I recomend the Wobbs salad or the meatball sub.< /Text><Time>1560238735180</Time>< resp>

<user_id>105531917136416439458< /user_id><Review>I will start off by saying I believe they changed ownership. It was my go to spot for dinner on work nights now they lost me...I would spend approx $50 each time I ordered so you think they would value a regular customer. After change in ownership, we received our pizza over cooked to the point my kids were having difficulty biting the bread so they just scooped the toppings. Next visit I expressed concern about my last order and so they undercooked it...I thought ok at least they tried to accommodate me. So I gave them another chance, this order was gross without flavor, undercooked dough. I love extreme signature sauce so I always order extra sauce...it had no flavor!!!! My husband co-signed regarding the flavor. My conclusion I will take my hard earned money where it’s appreciated< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< username>

I've never eaten there but order delivery all the time.  Love the pizza and it always arrives quickly and hot.

I can't say much about  their decor but if you have plans to stay home and watch a good movie, their Pizza goes good with romantic comedies and action films.</Review>

Ordered 3 personal pizzas and 2 orders of twists at 5:45 tonight. Order was supposed to be delivered around 6:30. Called at 6:45 was told they would be at my door any minute. Called again at 7:00 waaaas told they would call the driver and call me back. Called again at 7:15 and the manager said she would call the driver.... as he showed up. Everything was tepid. Called and spoke to the manager mentioning that no one seemed interested in customer service, she offered nothing, not even an apology. Sad. Used to be my favorite pizza, won't be back.</Review>

Love this place. Clean and a great place for family activities. Football, baseball, basketball, tennis, playgrounds, skate park & walking/ jogging trails. Lots of area to have a picnic or BBQ pits & tables available also. Lots of parking.</Text>

Park has nice amenities, unfortunately there are a lot of dog owners that don't pick up the poop from their dogs!</Text>

The park has a big parking lot and a good amount of space for picnics. There's a skate park a good distance away from the kids play area. There's also two tennis courts and basketball courts here. I even enjoy taking a stroll through the whole park, it's very peaceful and the greenery helps calm my mind. It's close to a residential street so it's fairly safe except for the far end of the parking lot. But definitely recommend coming here.</text>

<Review>Great place for a run, a single lap on the path is .25 mile.  The 2 playgrounds are nice, they have a foam ground so it's not as dirty as most, and they have a little skate park
Ohh but the bathrooms don't have doors on their stalls so there's no privacy 😒< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgIlY5N59eKO7BNwlwgry59O6iEFg3wPAEj-8L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4pyYfhe-R4n4Ze-zF5sbzO73af6AlRVyMP7Fv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSRTstv-4jOwNzZqs28CjdJoIV3CnYl2yOSnWe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< GmapID>

<Text>Rialto needs to touch up this skatepark a little. Someone defaced one of the ramps with puck you. It looks as though they used to have a nice cover to give some shade on the skatepark that no one has replaced. There's a shoe hanging on one of the lines to the non existent cover. Can't say the best of crowd hangs out here when you have elementary kids that frequent the park.

< review>
This is a nice park with a lot of trees, grass, playground suited for older kids, basketball courts,  and tennis courts.  There is a skate park adjacent to the park and 99% of the time its just kids who want to skate,  every now and then you someone smoking pot close to the playground. I took off one star because there was a small playground for little kids that they removed and doesn't seem like they're planning on replacing itat this time.< /review>

< Review>
This park is clean, it has a field for soccer, picnic, or whatever you choose to bring, and a softball field, it has a skate section for practicing tricks and light in that area, it has 2 gazebo section for gatherings or parties, 2 basketball courts, 2 tennis courts, 2 medium playgrounds, a medium walking trail and about 2-4 grills on the premises. Usually the people there are respectful and descent.</Review>

This is a nice park with a lot of trees, grass, playground suited for older kids, basketball courts,  and tennis courts.  There is a skate park adjacent to the park and 99% of the time its just kids who want to skate,  every now and then you someone smoking pot close to the playground. I took off one star because there was a small playground for little kids that they removed and doesn't seem like they're planning on replacing itat this time.</text>

I saw the cops searching someone in the further section of the parking lot.

The skatepark here is top notch, it has just enough of everything, good flow, all around fun. There was a welcoming vibe which was super nice, some parks are super territorial like skateboarding is a gang activity or something... Fergusson gets 5 stars.< /Review>

Fergusson Park to Kulim Park, via a scenic walkway along Tauranga Harbour is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours walking whilst in theTauranga area. Great views of Mount Maunganui all along the way, with its majestic 230m high volcanic cone, and of the Port of Tauranga. Lots of benches scattered here and there for a rest.<//Text>

Overall a nice neighborhood park.  It's well maintained most of the time; weekends get trashy due to the people there that don't pick up after themselves--Like many public facilities, I guess.  Our group walks mornings/evenings past this park; watch out for "rif-raf" that have nothing better to do than hang out--Again, like many public facilities.<//review>
