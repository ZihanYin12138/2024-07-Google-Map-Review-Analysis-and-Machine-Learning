< Review>
It’s pretty ridiculous to be waiting 20+ minutes for any given machine or equipment… this gym is way too packed, no matter what time of day or week you’re guaranteed to wait long periods of time to use something. Not enough equipment to use and way too many people here for that to be acceptable. Cleanliness is not a priority either- especially during a pandemic, there is not enough cleaning staff.</Review>

<Review>Their not doing anything to keep people safe by checking that every person at the gym is wearing their face mask. I tried contacting them because I don’t think it’s fair that others have to pay more $ than others and can’t use all the equipment in their plan. Not enough equipment and too dirty. As soonest my contract ends I will cancel it and find a better gym.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I came here after 24hour was forced to close, and I'm glad that I did. The staff are genuinely nice and are eager to help, unlike my old gym these people seem to care. Its also cheaper, which is great. They have done a great job with the outdoor gym, its clean and everyone seems chill. It also feels great getting your pump in while the breeze cools you off, keep it up Golds Gym!<//Text>< pictures>

Cancelling membership, they decided to unfreeze my account during the pandemic because apparently for them it's is not longer of importance. They did not even try to make it right so I'm done with them, paying the cancellation fee in order to no longer deal with these ridiculous people. They didn't even enforce pandemic guidelines when I was there, did not offer any sense of security from this pandemic. This place is a joke.< /review>

< Review>
Gym is not doing their part to keep members safe and protect our community. I noted my concern on a survey the manager. Joseph reached out and  gave me a generic response. The gym is not being cleaned as it should and hopes that each member will clean after themselves. While at the gym I recorded a video of 7 different members using the same machine. Not until the last member was the machine cleaned. 7 different exposures then went on to use the rest of the gym. Not once did an employee come out to clean or check if masks were being worn in the 2 hours spent there. When I email back with my concerns in detail the manager Joseph didn't bother to respond. When I asked to freeze my account and wait for this to clear up they agreed. I was told to contact the manager which I did and still no response. This entire process starting in July and still no response. To make matters worse the same situation was happening to my elderly mother who can not risk her life to go to a gym who does not care about their members or the community.In a time where vaccines are not available for everyone. It's unfortunate to think how many people who might have died due to the gross negligence of this company and manager. I leave this review in hopes that it will save some people from getting sick.<//Review>

Not the best it can be, but not their fault either. I've tried coming in late, early, and evenings as well, but its always packed! Early is probably the best but not by a long shot still. Everything is modern looking and clean, but it is heavily reduced in size and amount of machines due to covid-19 being a present issue to us all. That is the only problem with this setup currently. 5 stars overall once the place can be back to normal, which I can't wait for since I am new to this gym and never got to experience the whole thing. Work with what you got for now and it is better than not having any options.</review>

Only had a membership since November 2020 at $20/month. That only equals roughly $100 to this day. Then they Literally stole two payments of $229 out of my bank account. Plus an additional 38.54, and have made no attempt to right the situation. If I stole $500 from someone I’d be in jail.

5/10 to update this. Joseph agreed to return half of my money. This never happened. Avoid this place and the scumbag who runs it.< /Text>

I wish I could give 0 stars. I had such a bad experience with this gym as a result of the COVID pandemic. It is so difficult to get out of your contract and they were even sued for that very reason by the Ventura County DA in 2013. I moved out of Oxnard because of the pandemic and the Gold's gym near my new home (Long Beach) was closed even though the gym in Oxnard was open. I signed up for one of the more expensive plans so I could have access to all gyms because I move around alot. Gold's gym Oxnard continued to charge me the same amount even though I wasn't getting the full benefits I paid for and I couldn't even use the gym! Then they made it nearly impossible to transfer my account to someone else. I drove up all the way to Oxnard after I was told over the phone I could make a transfer in person and when I got to the Oxnard location they told me I couldn't because I had to wait for my next payment or something. This was such a nightmare and I went through it from August to January. Not only was I given wrong information multiple times but the team members were so rude, had poor attitudes, and unhelpful. Yes Gold's gym is cheaper than 24hr fit but I guess you get what you pay for. It's not worse getting a cheaper membership because they will screw you over.</Review>

<review>Careful if you get your membership here the management staff is unresponsive. I tried to freeze my membership as well as my mother's due to the pandemic but unfortunately have not been able to get in contact with anyone in management even after numerous emails and screenshots.

Update

Don't bother contacting their retention team it's a big waste of time. Not only do they take weeks at a time to respond but are unlikely to help with a resolution. This gym definitely does not deserve anyone's patronage.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1611261240987, 'text': "We are sorry that your experience didn’t quite match your expectations.

<Text>Miscommunication on ALL levels . Membership agreements are separate even if theres a primary person that gets billed. Separate cancelation fees . Nonstop robo phone calls asking for updated billing no follow up email.  Gold gym handles membership but financial is ABC financial so if u have an issue with either one they will just send you calling to both coz neither one will admit one's mistake and just put the blame on each other.</Text>< rate>

<Text>Worst customer service I have ever received. I am never one to post or comment on a business because being a small business owner myself I understand the struggles one can be going through. However I also understand the value of service and I can guarantee this place is not it. I have had various gym memberships and I have never been treated poorly as I did at Golds Gym in Oxnard. Janeka is one of the managers and my first impression was of her on her phone texting as I was entering the facility. Not only did she not greet me but she also didn’t answer my questions or concerns. Instead she gave me attitude and spoke to me as I had no idea what was going on. I believe leaders should lead by example so hopefully Golds takes this into consideration when selecting their leadership team. The quality of customer service comes a long way, this industry isn’t for anyone and perhaps they should find a replacement for Janeka to better improve their service.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I canceled because it was always packed no matter what time of day and overall just super crowded. I went in person to cancel only to find out they can’t cancel my membership in person so they redirected me to a website I could do it through. I HAD TO PAY $200 TO CANCEL??? FOR WHAT? Especially during COVID?? Outrageous. It was super easy for them to sign me up and get my banking info but to cancel I had to go through such a hassle. Im going back to 24.</review>

What's more annoying than packing 100+ people in a makeshift outdoor gym like a can of sardines?

...Charging a member an extra month while  canceling, due to moving.  It's covid...I paid for march and gave notice to moving.  Smh, can't even use golds as there isn't one in my new location and they won't cancel it til Apr 30.< /Text>

Love the place , switched from LAF, love the equipment, the space , the layout , how well they did in making the outside gym look like a real gym and not just a parking lot to work out of , and the staff is  always pleasant every time i have needed anything, I also love that I haven’t struggled for parking at all either even in the busy evening hours  . On the improvements I wish to see , is  that I wish there were consequences for the members who don’t comply w the mask requirement . I have witnessed and appreciate the staff walking around to remind everyone to wear the mask, everyone I know hates wearing the mask, and I’m sure the staff hates enforcing or having to remind people to wear it. But,  it’s for everyone’s best interests to protect ourselves .   Many times , there are too many wearing the mask wrong ( nose out ) and some w no mask at all. True during the evening hours ( 6:45 pm and later , weekdays) I want the gym to remain open and people who don’t comply will ruin it for everyone who does.< /Text>

I’ve been a member of numerous gyms around the area. The old Golds, 24 hour fitness and others. By far the best gym I’ve been to. The morning staff is always on time and very pleasant. Can’t say that about all the others. There is plenty of squad racks and different work out stations to please everyone. The price is also a steal!! Me and my son currently attend for the price of myself at the 24. No longer a 24 member. Thanks Golds keep up the good work<//Text>

Honestly since covid they closed down and I am struggling financially and I guess one day they started charging again and I called to cancel and was told I needed to go through all these loops in order to do so and pay $50 to cancel I just wish they were more supportive during these times</review>

The gym is okay. But the customer service is horrible.you have to call a special
Number to cancel your membership and you have to pay $200 to cancel if your contract is not expired yet. And once my contract expired and I canceled and they still charged me. Very disorganized and I don’t recommend this gym.< /Text>

How about you enforce your own rules with regard to bags on the gym floor.  One day I saw 4 people almost fall on their face because of gym bags on the floor.  I had one person leave a bag right in between the Incline Bench Press' and I "accidentally" kicked it in order for me to adjust my weights.< /Text>

<Text>I give it a three star rating because it's a brand new gym and equipment is already breaking and the turn around time to get the brand New piece of equipment fix takes awhile. Girlfriend tried to use the Sauna (steam room) was broken and it would take a week to fix. Plus, you need to be wearing a bathing suit or a towel to utilize the steam room. Which wasn't presented during the soft opening tour of the gym. I will give it a few more months and re-evaluate. If unplease, back to 24hrs.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1582748031462, 'text': "Kapono,\nThank you and your girlfriend for being Gold's Gym members.

There are still some relics there that indicate this (stickers on equipment and doors.) Anyways I just want to give the community a warning as back when Gold's Gym was around they engaged in extremely illegal and sketchy practices. Like automatically renewing your membership unless you mailed them a letter saying otherwise, through snail mail by the way, and with tracking otherwise they'd deny you ever sent it. Luckily I heard about other's experiences and was able to dodge such bullets but it was awful. Just a warning from a local Oxnard resident.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

These hours are very limiting.
....Early bird gets the worm......
These hours to me dont meet Golds Gym criteria to be known as an elite gym. Maybe this is incorrect (HOPING) But 9am- 9pm does not play into a role of someone tryin to get a great work out and cardio in at 5 6 in the morning to start there proactive busy schedule for the rest of the day....<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I loved how this gym will look! I give it 5 stars because it offers much more than the others in Oxnard at a more comfortable price, I chose the best membership that has everything included for me and my family and they gave me the second year for free because I referred 3 friends !!! I am delighted with the service and guidance they gave me. God bless you.

This no-frills hot dog counter serves up a wonderful dog! I always forget how much I like a good hot dog, and I'm so thankful that I found Jimbo's to remind me! The owner was very nice and quick to help me. He just celebrated his 30th anniversary of business, and I see why he's been around so long. Top quality lunch on the cheap, I got a hot link with cheese the way I wanted it for less than $5! A new favorite lunch spot!< /Review>< pictures>

I discovered Jimbo's Hot Dogs after they were reviewed in the local paper.
I was thrilled with the quality of their hot dogs.
The staff was very nice and professional.
Willing to answer all of my questions.
The menu is pretty simple and straightforward.
All the usual hot dog toppings.
Plus they have hot links and sausages.
A great little place.
I will definitely be back.</review>

I left the Bay Area in 1987, returned to the East Bay in 1996, and FINALLY got back to Jimbo's in 2016, since I now work in Marin again as I did in 1982. The best! I am going today.

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Jimbos is a local secret. Me and my buddies cone here AT LEAST twice a week on our lunch break. The regular hotdog (Jimbo dog) is probably the best hotdog I've ever had. I know that doesnt sound like much, but don't knock it until you try it! The Polish dog is to die for and the Hot links are actually spicy! There are a variety of toppings and they will make your dog EXACTLY how you want it. Super friendly staff that always remembers your name. Definitly worth checking out if you haven't!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I've been going there for some time now, and I thought it was high time I shared  my humble opinion....JIMBO'S HOT DOG RESTAURANT is simply the perfect place to get a hot dog or other sandwich anywhere in the area ...all the meats, buns, condiments, and extras are prepared to perfection...even the drinks are as cold as you can find...if you've never been there.  GO!!!.....BONUS: The price is right...</Text>< Pics>

Like the food and Latvian owners very much, but am completely turned off by them being closed all weekend. Unacceptable for a food establishment this country, particularly California, to be closed all weekend. I will look elsewhere for my hot dogs.< /Review>

I was ready for a day of waiting by my front door after the lock gave out for the services of a smith. I’m glad I called this man. He was courteous, fast, and professional.  He was in and out within 20min. I only wish there was more stars to give. Thank you!< /Review>

You never think it's going to happen to you, until it does. Keep this number handy! Erick answered right away, quoted me 25 minutes, but was there a bit faster. Within 3 minutes that he arrived, I was able to get back inside my house and out to work. Highly recommend| quick & efficient.</text>

Our family is a local business owner. We bought a van for the business and Eric recommended, ordered , re keyed abs provided us with back up locks. He’s dependable, on time, a great value and overall very professional. Trust is a major factor when keys and locks are involved. we trust Eric and value his service. He’s the one to call for company or household/auto needs! He’s highly recommended by our family!</Text>

<Text>Erick Hartman, the owner, makes sure you feel safe and secure.  We had to get our home rekeyed late one night and he personally came out and took care of us.  His company is dependable, reliable, quick, cost effective and he is so kind and personable.  I highly recommend him for keying your home and security.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Erick just left my home and helped change all of my door locks. Erick was fast and gave me a quick lesson on how key locks work. I was a bit shy on dollars and Erick put in a much needed new door handle even though I was short on my funds.
Thank you so much for your kindness and efficient help.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Erick came by this morning to re-key my home. When I was calling around to find a locksmith he was the only one I called that actually answered his phone. I'm still waiting on a call back from one of his competitors that I left a message with. He arrived at 9 and was driving away by 10. He did a fantastic job and I will recommend him to anyone.</Review>

The recommendation for this company is outstanding… I called the company to do an unlock on my running vehicle 8am. (Needless to say, school day, in a rush, while the car was warming up, someone closed the door with the doors were locked) He gave me an estimated arrival time of 35 minutes, and showed up in 20. Very prompt, very professional, and  very helpful. When most companies we’re 1 to 2 hour waiting times, I am very grateful for your service sir... I will be recommending you to everyone I know, and though I hope it doesn’t happen again, your card will stay in my wallet just in case...To a great New Year, to you, and your whole company.</Text>

<review>Didn’t even know this location existed, always went to the J Street location (the girls there are sweet and professional). Had my first visit today and I love it here. Super spacious, clean, orderly AND the staff...just wow. My dental assistant Sherone (not sure that’s how it’s spelled) had the best bedside manner of any one I’ve had to interact with. Ever. You can tell she knows her stuff and is confident in her work. Also, Mr. Rody is superb at his position. He took time to explain everything in detail, make sure I understood and didn’t rush through any of my silly questions. Added bonus for amazing personality and humor. Def making this my home office. Thanks to all the great staff at Halyard location.</review><pics>None< /pics>< GmapID>

Had appt with Oksana Rutkevich, their Nutritionist/Dietician.  Facilities were very clean and staff was very nice,  professional and efficient.  I didn't have a long wait at all. Oksana is very knowledgeable,  explains things very well an answered all of my questions. She even answered questions I didn't know I had!  She was able to shed light and support in areas that I needed and reinforcing in areas I need to work on.  A very positive experience!  I would definitely recommend her to anyone seeking assistance with their nutritional needs.<//Text>

<Review>This place is a joke. I have one appointment scheduled and I come in for them to tell me my Dr. left early, no call in advance or nothing. Then they say they can’t reschedule me because she is leaving the practice the following week so they make me an appointment the following week. I just come in for the clerk to tell me Dr. Fosset isn’t in today. You guys have terrible time management and scheduling and unreliable doctors in that office. Your clerks are always chatting with a line of people waiting to be checked in. I will not be coming back<//Review></record></dataset><record>

BEWARE ALL POTENTIAL AND CURRENT PATIENTS! This Elica Health facility will not acknowledge the mistakes that they make. Do not trust any of the staff here as they see you as a number rather than a patient. They are incompetent! This facility will only see and hear your concerns when you are paying for a visit. There is no respects given to the patient at all.

I only needed to obtain my copy of additional medical documents required by my school. However, this Elica Health facility is not adequately trained to carry out this simple request.

My calls to reach this facility resulted in the call to be hung up on twice! The third attempt went straight to voicemail. When I confronted their clinic manager about this unprofessionalism, there was no apology and she told me it was an accident by her staff that happened to hang up my call TWICE.

The staff will fabricate their own story to cover up their mistakes and their clinic manager will support those fabrications. And the clinic had the audacity to escalate the situation called the police when I confronted them about their negligence. I was not made aware that police would be on their way to the clinic in efforts to get rid of me. There was no warning given by the manager or security to me that my presence and my concerns for a resolution that we could both agree on, was a threat. But thankfully, I left when I did because the discussion went nowhere. As soon as I walked out of the doors, the police were there in their vehicle. As soon as I drove off, the police drove off as well. This clinic called the police and tried to have me arrested due to the fact that they did not like me discussing about their wrongdoings. This entire clinic thought I was a threat by me pointing out the facts that they purposely mistreated me and not wanting to find a resolution with me together. The clinic manager did not offer a resolution to my complaints.

I was denied access to my medical documents. I couldn't even see the status of them as their workers are not trained to upload medical documents unto their patient portal.
I feel racially targeted and denied as an Asian male by this facility. I left unsatisfied and unreassured as the staff was unable to produce any kind of copy of my documents. And I hope that no other patient goes through this experience.

12/28/20, Notice how my comment has not received any response from Elica Health. No response means they're refusing to acknowledge that my situation ever happened.</text>

I do not recommend anyone to use the services of a dentist, I made a root canal, but the tooth still feels cold and hot.  They said that I could come without an appointment, but when I arrived, it turned out that only with an appointment.  Appointed for another day and I waited more than an hour and I was never accepted.</review>

I waited a half hour in the room for a staple removal that took less than 2 minutes, I felt disregarded based on my age having been the last treated. Granted I was at the threshold of being late I did not feel like my procedure was important< /text>

Alan kristensen is the absolute worst doctor or nurse or whatever he is. He is the absolute worst. I have been suffering from chronic pain, I have been to the hospital, I have been to cancer doctors, I have multiple fractured and out of place ribs and this doctor wants to put me on antidepressants instead of helping me with my pain. He must get paid to sell antidepressants because that’s all he wants to do he does not want to help me. I had to beg for an appointment with another doctor After I’ve already waited weeks to get help with my pain. Now I have to wait longer.do not see Alan Christiansen he will not help you. All he cares about is selling antidepressants he probably gets paid to do that. This man is definitely in the wrong field he should work for a pharmaceutical company, he should not be a doctor in charge of helping people. He told me since I didn’t want to go on antidepressants that I should find another provider.
The girls at the front desk are really nice and actually got me an appointment with a different doctor in A couple of days. Hopefully he actually helps me this time instead of me having to go home in tears again< /Text>

I had a decent doctor but my appointments always seemed to be cancled. I did basic blood work that they are refusing to re code to my insurance so i am stuck with a 2k bill. Also if you want therapy you can forget about this place. 30 minute session 1x per month. Woman said that was plenty for most of her patients...I struggle with severe anxiety and depression and personaility disorder and was asked what i was doing there if i can speak so well. Ummm.....</Review>

<review>I saw Dr Fossett once, and he took me off of an opioid I'd been on for a long time for cervical dystonia, a neck condition following a broken neck and several surgeries. We talked about it and this was all fine and understood.
He also made a choice that was medically dangerous and knowingly gave me a 30% chance of having a seizure. That's medical malpractice and patients should be very aware of his temper.
What he didn't tell me is that he was also cutting my dosage of Diazapam, and when I continued to take the same dose I'd been taking for the last 5 years, I ran out 10 days early. This had never happened before. I wondered what on earth happened. Only then did I realize he'd changed my dose, without telling me or knowing anything about my medical history or speaking to the neurologists who originally prescribed the medication.
I asked for an explanation, and it was to punish me for not taking the medication as prescribed, and his office deflected blame to my pharmacy for not telling me. He knew I'd been taking my previous dose and wanted me to completely detox from a very dangerous level of benzos without medical care, which I've asked for and his office tells me to go to the ER "if you feel it's necessary". This is the exact opposite of the advice every medical website is giving me...What's happening???
The fact that he's willing to take a 30% chance of a seizure in my case just to punish me for a misunderstanding is astounding and something I have never seen in my life.</review>< Pictures>

I’m very pleased with the services that doctors provide there. I took my elder brother who is in his 70s and is morbidly obesed and have not stepped on a scale in 6 years!! He is on a wheelchair due to various medical reasons. And he is very stubborn and denies to step on the scale for years. But the twist here, a medical assistant her name was Neha, she convinced him to do so, her way of explaining to him as he is older and is very impatient was so great! My brother’s wife is very thankful to her because so many specalists doctors asked to weigh him but he always denies but her magic trick worked!!! She took almost 5 minutes by the scale talking to him so he should not feel bad about his weight! HE FINALLY STEPPED ON A SCALE after 6 years!
Thank you so much Neha for being so helpful, you are a blessing and “sunshine of medicine” as my brother stated. God bless you and thank you</text>

I went into the store to get a phone issue taken care of earlier today. It was some thing I had been trying to deal with for a couple of months Over the phone. I could never get anybody on the customer service line to help me because I didn’t have a second device for them to be able to call me on so it could be troubleshooted. I explain to them when I originally bought the phone that within a week I was having issues using it. I had a trip planned out and when I left I had no service I have no data I could not contact anybody at boost mobile. When I logged into my account I had multiple phone calls and text messages with phone numbers that I had and had no knowledge of. When I explained everything to both of the workers in the store they then told me that they couldn’t do too much more because I didn’t pay my phone bill. I had paid over $200 in the past two months trying to get my service changing my plan calling over and over. I was not happy with the management due to the fact that I have been a loyal customer for years and refuse to pay my phone bill this month because I’m tired of not being able to access it. I got a new Sim card and they told me that if it doesn’t fix the problem maybe I should just go to Metro. I don’t think I’ve ever been to a store and then so appalled with the service that was given. This is ridiculous I don’t understand how you can go ahead and point to a different competitor and send me their way I will definitely be making another phone call to the customer service line and try to get some decent help. I don’t recommend going here for anybody. They made me feel out of place because the phone bill wasn’t paid most uncomfortable customer service experience I’ve ever had. Zero stars< /Review>

<rate>4<//rate><Text>I was very impressed with the customer service experience I had. Joe went above and beyond my expectations and was able to answer all of my questions about promotions and about switching companies. I was at a crossroads about a couple of phones and he found out all of the information I wanted to know to help me make the best decision for me. The rest of his staff was awesome at keeping up with the demands of the store as it was a very busy day as well.

Only 4 stars because I would only improve upon selection of phone cases available. Otherwise it was a smooth, easy, stressless experience.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

My name is Elizabeth Mena and I have been a Boost Mobile customer for the past 8-9 years now or maybe more. Time flies!! Anyways I was having trouble retrieving my emails. Could not figure out what the problem was. I have had a lot on my plate lately and this just added more stress to my daily routine,
because I do all my business correspondence through my emails... So I decided to take my phone to Boost Mobile today 10/10/19 on Chicago Ave in Riverside, California. The customer service representative who helped me out was named Joe. He was very kind and knowledgeable to take care of my problem... ☺☺ Prior to walking into the store I was stressing, however when Joe was done helping me retrieve my emails I was happy again!! ☺ So I just want to thank you Boost Mobile for hiring kind and knowledgeable employees....

Warm Regards, ☺

I didn't hate the place but, all boost stores are scamming people out of money, they charge u for the phone and they charge you to activate it, a $50 phone came up to $80 and I qualified for an upgrade that was supposed to give me a discount. Go to Best Buy, the phones cost what the price tag says, and if u don't know how to activate it, they'll do it for free, save a few bucks</Text>

<time>1538771125686< /time><rating>1< /rating><Text>This company is wrong and I reccommend staying far away. The other companies offer superior flexibility and prices. This location robbed us for 90 dollars. They took 90 dollars from us and in return we literally got nothing. That definitely equates to a 1 star experience. If someone robs you for 90 dollars with a smile, they are still a nasty crook.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1593890770490, 'text': "We appreciate your review.

<Response>None<//Response><username>Marcus Jackson< /username><Review>Eddie isVery helpful and informative. Took time to explain everything to me. Got a good phone. I wanted to get a high end phone and was willing to pay but all three guys really pushed the free Stylo 4. Never been sold down before so that was weird.. the Stylo 4 is slow with jenky video quality and has no native network texting. Your forced to use the free messages app from Google play which is awful! Longer text get split into smaller out of order text that may or may not send and receive even within the hour. The Stylo 4 also has lo ROM so it's more frustrating then my lk20 I intended to upgrade from in the first place.</Review><Rate>4<//Rate><pictures>None< /pictures><UserId.>102878209800981673996</UserId.>< gmap_id>

This store is great I love the customer service first of all because they make you feel welcomed. I am not phone literate and the help they gave me was amazing because they helped me transfer my information and always welcomed me with a smile.
La mejor tienda que te atienden bien y me ayudaron mucho con mis contactos.< /text>

I got an LG Stylo 3 there and the Bluetooth doesn't work. It also can't connect to the internet half the time even though there is plenty of signal strength. Went in and asked the clerk about warranty service. She acted like it was the first time she ever even heard the word warranty. I don't know if it's the phone, the service, or both, but it sucks as much as their no-existent customer service.</Text>

<Time>1590816312892< /Time><Response>None< /Response><review>I've been working out at Harbor Fitness for a little over 3 years now, and I really enjoy the facility. Always a friendly atmosphere, never a wait on the machines, and it's clean. I recently started personal training with Jack Marshall--and while it's only been a little under a month, I'm already seeing a change! He is always punctual (I have little free time--so that's important), friendly, and most importantly, creates fun and motivating workouts for me that result in change!< /review>< GmapID>

<Review>Lot of peeps get hung up on the hours, which I totally get. But in all fairness it is in a food court that's underground for some weird reason, so it could well be out of their control.
Gym is decent, older equipment but I didn't encounter a single malfunction. Old school dungeon gym vibe. Locker room is okay. Front desk peeps are friendly enough. This is clearly an Active location that's being called a Sport for no real reason, but oh well. Unless you wanna swim or steam you'll be able to get everything you want done.< /Review>< pictures>

It's locked on regular business hour. Called Corporate office and heard no phone number even they could reach out. A lot of people are waiting outside for over an hour due to parking validation and also for shower for work. Here in this building the parking rate is $32 per hour. At least the manager phone number is to place on window. No System at all for emergency.</Text>

Worst club ever.  They tried multiple times to cancel my membership only to "renew" it as a much higher rate.  I would give them negative stars if it was possible.< /Review>

<Review>I've had classes with Mike, Bea and Roly and they were are all GREAT and they encourage the members to do the most they can!  If you are looking for a change and new challenge, I recommend it.  Btw, it's also fun in a hard as hell, kind of way!< /Review>< rating>

It’s a decent gym.. if u are the king of person who likes a good 2.5 hour workout this gym ain’t the place to visit.. two hour 1.50 parking after that is 24 bucks plus after that...  I won’t be here again...</Review>

Nice gym for Early Birds. Clean facilities. Updated equipment. Everything is on one floor, and the facility itself is subterranean. Also, they open on Time every day, even though they're actually not open for 24 hours.< /text>

I just went to this gym for the first time. It is so much nicer now. They got some new equipment, new paint and new cool clothes for sale for the gym. I really like the changes they made and I look forward to going there more often. Nice changes! Keep it up.< /review>

<review>When I moved to Los Angeles, I thought I wouldn't need a gym membership, because I'd be so outdoorsy, hiking all day on the weekends and running through the park at 6:30am during the week. Yeaaaah, guess what, that didn't happen. At least not to an extent that could justify repeated trips to b Patisserie and Salt & Straw.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7b3b03af0f3:0xe29d7bf7982a55c1<//Gmap_id></record>

This particular  locale closes at 12 mid night and opens at 5am.  However, the one on Wilshire & Serrano is open 24.  So, when I decide that I want to do an after midnight exercise, there is a other locale I can use.  What I also like about this company, is that w/ your account, U can visit ANY fitness center and enjoy a good workout.</review>< Pictures>

<Response>None<//Response><review>switched from chute to crunch been to 3 this one is by far the best gym. It has more features like spa, pool, jacuzzi, day care, mma room and by far the cleanest.

<Text>Convenient location. Gym locker room is pretty consistently dirty. The showers and toilet areas are gross. And they cut short the hours because they said there's not a lot of late night traffic, but that's because it's located underground. They need to open a new one somewhere in South Park where most of the DTLA residents are now.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I wanted to try this gym since I bought a membership and works at any 24 hour fitness. Coming in, I had high expectations. However, it’s much smaller than it looks in pictures, it smells and feels filthy. Machines are old, and so are the locker rooms. The restroom is disgusting and there’s only 3 so I couldn’t use it. I wouldn’t recommend this gym, atmosphere isn’t as great as other 24 hour fitness gyms. It’s also underground so there’s no service. It was very hard to find this gym.</Text>

Very dirty..... No-one cleans the showers or bathrooms.  There's mold every where. Stream room is usually broken. It is now a sports club from active when nothing was upgraded, not the equipment, conditions or spatial quality. Instructors have been fired and cut out. They have been replaced by digital Fitness😂😂😂what a joke!!! DTLA has many gyms. 24 is just disappointing!!!<//Review>

<text>Its your typical 24hr sport gym, you're not going to get the variety of equipment you would get at a supersport, no towel service or steam room, sauna, jacuzzi or pool, locker rooms could be a bit cleaner and updated, there's always an out of order sink or bathroom stall when I go there, but then again, it's a sport and you're getting sport service. If you're just looking for a simple work out with none of the extra amenities then go for it, very convenient location.< /text><user_name>Pilar Singleton<//user_name><Time>1551222885708<//Time><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c2c7b3b03af0f3:0xe29d7bf7982a55c1</GmapID><pics>None<//pics><rate>3</rate>< userid>

It's kind of hard to find the gym but the place look descent. The paking garage at 400 Flower St. but you have to push call button to tell them that you are going to the gym to get in. They won't give you parking ticket. When you return, just pay $1.50 at parking office on the 7th floor.< /text>

Avoid this socialist establishment.  The general manager is forcing her agenda on club patrons.  Extremely unprofessional general manager.  Unfortunately my last post was removed.  It must have been flagged by you know who.  Seems she feels, as evident in previous complaints, to be more important than 24 hour fitness member retention.  District and regional management show no attempt to resolve complaints.  Cancelled my membership and won't ever go back.<//Text>

Very okay. It's about as clean as other 24's in downtown areas. The bathrooms are an embarrassment, and I'll leave them at that. There is an incredibly limited amount of weight plates. You'll likely have to ask someone when they will be done with a set of 25's. Staff was friendly. Overall lacking a significant amount of the qualities most 24 have.<//text>

Parking garage is located across the street and one block north at the 444 Flower parking garage. It was $1.50 for an hour with validation. It has all the essentials you need for a good workout. Overall appearance of the facility is a little worn.</Text>

We came to her gym for the Neon Zumba party. The staffs decorate the group classroom and prepare glow sticks necklaces and bracelets for us. How fun!!

Two thumbs up to the Zumba instructor, Hana Hall~ She totally rocks the dance floor! Everyone is having so much fun. We dance, we laugh & we sweat like a pig!!!

The Gym: Very clean and well maintained. It is located at 505 underground plaza, tons of retails and restaurants. Great location for the people working in DTLA.<//review>< Pics>

Good: None.

Bad: The place is too small. Mondays are always PACKED. Lots of people who stay there just to mingle and are not focused on their workouts. No swimming pool or sauna. Showers are too small. Trainers are unhelpful and uninviting. I would not recommend this gym to anyone.< /text>

<text>No, no, no. They will take your money while you sleep. They told me I was on a 6 month hold which was a lie. They are still charging me to this day. Devils of money manipulation. The gym is small underground and depressing. It's not even 24hours. Do not go there I warn you fellow Christians and human beings, for you must be an alien out of your natural mind to sign up with these ppl. You might as well hit a couple lines of white and you would still save more money losing weight. Real life. ☝️👎</text><date>1449924803136< /date>< resp>

<Review>Kind of a hidden location but it's in the basement of the city national Bank building. It's a nice place, there are tons of restaurants and Starbucks in the basement. It's like a hidden large food court and the gym down there. It doesnt get too crowded. My biggest problem is the parking. They do validate but the parking it like 2 blocks away and it's a pain. Other than that it's nice location.< /Review>< gmapID>

The name '24 Hr Fitness" seems incompatible with a 6pm close time. They should maybe consider renaming this particular franchise.

Misrepresentation aside, how do you run a gym in the densest part of the LA region and not find a way to keep it open during early evening hours? This location probably shouldn't exist in its current form.</text>

One of the worst gyms I've ever been to. many of the machines are ancient or broken altogether. The bathrooms are *always* a mess- at least one of the four toilets are always broken, half of the stalls are out of soap or missing shower curtains, there are no towels available for showering (hell- there aren't even paper towels available in the restrooms).  It's an awful experience, especially for a place that I'd assume most people go right before work like myself. Seriously, the gym is being near the point of needing not just renovation, but demolition.

Raising issues (politely) to management does nothing.

Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other gyms in the area- LA fitness down the street also doesn't have towel service, but at least it's clean and well maintained.< /review>

Cuts work out short considering a round trip walk from the parking structure to the gym is about 20mins. And $1.50 a day for parking adds up, it costed me about 30$ a month on just parking on top of the 35$ a month membership that's 65$ a month for a gym membership seems really steep especially for such a small gym with a big inconvenience.< /Review>< rate>

Is a very small gym most of the equipment looks worn out I'll surprise when I saw that just because they're in the center downtown in the heart of LA and they have crappy equipment another thing sucks you have to pay for parking if my much but the ads to what you're paying for a membership already I never see someone behind the desk when I get there they're mostly chitchatting in the table I go there around 9pm-1030 and I don't see that much people in there probably oh yeah before I forget this place kind of difficult to find it took me a good 20 minutes then I realize it'sunder ground and the entrance is kind of hidden in a way as well< /text>

I come to the gym and the managers says: "your account is suspended because you do not have your credit card on file". I am like, fine, I will bring it to you once I receive a new one, my dues are paid a month in advance anyway. She gives me this smirk and replies: "Sorry, no one is allowed without a credit card on file, so come back when you have it". How's that for client retention? You think I will ever go back there?

<time>1476855519206<//time><rate>2<//rate><text>So I'm currently a member and this particular location is convenient enough to grind out the remainder of my membership. Where do I start... the bathrooms are atrocious. The only two urinals in the men's room have been broken for about a month, and the SMELL. The gym offers access to "executive" restrooms for an additional $20 a month. Damaged and unusable equipment that seem to never get fixed are spread all over the gym cluttered, disorganized and frankly pretty dangerous. I've had two encounters with the general manager, neither of which were at all pleasant. She, along with the rest of the staff, seem generally indifferent to the various goings on regarding customer dissatisfaction. The gym is located in the basement of the building with no wifi and no cell service. I gave them two stars instead of one because they happen to be located next door to a Mrs. Fields bakery.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

This is called 24 Hour Fitness. THEY ARE NOT OPEN FOR 24 HOURS. They aren't even open past 6pm on Saturdays. This is super limiting and really misleading for a gym that prides itself on being open all hours in order to be accessible for all people of all jobs.</review>

The fact that this gym closes at 6 on Saturday is why I’m giving this rating. I have to go out of my way to another location that I despise. When I first started going there that wasn’t the case. Like most, I joined 24 hr fitness due to it being open when I need it to be.  Gym is typically clean though</review>

This Location Is Hideous:

- Bathrooms Are Too Disgusting To Use.

- Toilets Are Sitting With The Same Pee Stains From Previous Days.

- Most Mornings There's No Toilet Papers Nor Seat Covers.

- Showers Are Broken With Holes In The Curtains.

- Toilets Are Broken With Broken Doors.

- Some Exercise Machines Are Broken.

- (new) They Turn The Lights Off Permanently In The Locker Rooms, Bathrooms, Showers Everyday While Customers Are Still Using The Facilities Before Gathering Their Items During Closing, Which Is A Big Safety Hazard.

My Recent Complaint To Corporate Was:
Once I Walked In Around 5:30pm On A Saturday, There Was No One At The Front Desk To Let Me Know They Closed At 6pm On A Saturday, So My Workout Was Interrupted, Due To No One At The Front Desk To Greet Me Nor Notify Me About The Closing Hours.

I Told An Employee That There Hours Of Operation Differs From What's On Google And She Said..."Well You Shouldn't Rely On Google."

NOT KNOWING THAT GOOGLE IS THEE TOP SEARCH ENGINE IN THE WORLD...It's Not Google's Fault That This Location Hours Differ From Online Than What This Location Operates By, It's The Lazy Nitwit Manager's / Employees Fault For Not Updating Their Business Information On Google...Which Is Very Vital For The Modern Day Customers Who Uses The Internet.

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION (wish i could rate this with a negative star, because they dont deserve one)< /text>

This is the only "Sport" level 24 Hr. Fitness Center I have found that does not have a swimming pool, hot tub, or free parking.  Parking costs $1.25/ hr., and they are not even open 24 hours as their name states---they close at 6pm tonight, which is nutsy.<//Text>

This is “The worst gym in the 24 hr network! The staff is horrible and rude and it appears that the staff have allowed the gym to be emptied of most of he free weights! Although it would have to be an inside job for all the free weights to come up missing the staff would rather blame the paying members for the missing free weights.

<Text>I use to go to this gym 5 days out the week. I stoped going here because it gets expensive going here. ill pay my membership plus the parking. that's more than $70 a month. not to mention the parking staff are really rude!!! if you don't have a nice car they make u park all the way towards the back. the excuse they always gave me is (this whole area is valet parking only and its $10 a night). this place is really hard to find if u don't know your way around downtown l.a and once u get to the gym you loose all your signal from your phone so you can't play radio stations on your phone. sometimes the staff aren't in the front and anyone can walk in.

other than those reasons the place is always clean and its pretty empty after 10p.m so you won't have trouble useing what you want. never been here in the day so I cannot comment on that BUT IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF MONEY TO THROW AWAY A MONTH THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU...< /Text></record>

I really didn't enjoy working out that gym. Please update the classes online their outdated. Staff really sucks their. People walk around thinking their tough. I think they should shut it down and open a better facility makes 24 hour fitness look bad. My high school looks better.</Text>

<text>another one of my yelp reviews that for mysterious reasons has disappeared.  OK...lets try this again.

This place can be a pain to find, as you have to maze your way around a bunch of strip mall-like restaurants, or actually, a dining courtyard for one of the skyscrapers.  Before you even get there, you'll have to find parking if you're not in the mood to walk a few miles to get here.  There's free parking after 6pm someplace, you can call them and ask...I always do because I always forget.

Once you get past all that, you have yourself a decent sized gym with a good atmosphere. It's not too crowded at all any time I've been there and when it was a bit crowded, there was no issue waiting for equipment.</text><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

So I wanted to check out this particular location before I sign up/get a membership and assign this club to be my 1st preference since it is close to where I work, and therefore I printed out a 3 -day pass which stated that it is valid for customers who are not a member within the last 6 months. When I take my 3-day pass to the club, this female employee who is wearing a red T-shirt claiming that she is the "Manager" of the club is going to "help" me with my pass. Once she found out that I was a 24 fitness member until 2008, she immediately told me that the best thing she could do is give me a 1 day pass. I explicitly told her "twice" that the 3-day pass is valid for customers who are not member within the last 6 months, then she immediately bring out the "corporate regulation fake crap" talk and persuade me to sign up for a monthly membership with a corporate discount code which my company gave me. Then she ditched me completely because of "code blue" (Within that 2 minutes I thought of taking my things and just leave). She came back after 2 minutes and gave me a 1 day pass while making me believe that she did something nice to me. After that, I told her that I will sign up my membership using costco's certificate, then she told me that I cannot do that because I was a returning member since 2008 (and this and that). Overall, this employee pretended to be the manager (who is not as I last checked), then lied to my face twice and hoping to get me sign up for a membership (because I can cancel anytime and implicitly she can get a commission if I sign up with her). This is total BS, and I do not believe her 1 bit. I submitted a complain online weeks ago, and I had not receive any feedback, and I am about to file this with BBB if I have to. For those of you out there, if you have a costco membership and not an existing member with an active membership, try signing up yourself online with corporate discount code or costco $369.99 2-yr-cert. I have a Master degree and I do my math, and I shop around to get the best deal while not believing this kind of inferior class deceitful sales.<//review>

The only reason to go there is that I can go any time I can and my personal instructor, who take care of my healthy workout. Nevertheless it is always crowded and not very clean and maintained. The last time even bathrooms disappointed me. I would not recommend it.< /text>

<Text>This 24 Hour Fitness is located in the underground mall below the City National Bank building. Since it's only 5 blocks from where I live, I cannot comment on parking, but since this is Downtown, expect to pay. Compared to other 24 Hour Fitnesses, it's not the best, but it's also not the worse. My biggest woe is that this place is not truly 24 hours and closes early on nights where I may have a late work out. This place is only 24 hours Mon through Thur. On Fri Sat Sun, this place will closed at around 6 or 7pm. Sure, it's probably for business and staffing reasons, but that's a big reason why I'm a 24 Hour Fitness member and not a Ballys or LA Fitness. Other than that, this underground gym has a nice and spacious group x room alongside the cardio equipment which fills a good half of this spot.<//Text><UserId.>113803940814573041855</UserId.>< response>

<Text>I have been a member of the 24hr fitness for about ten years. The type of membership I purchased gives me access to many of the gyms in the country. Of ALL of the 24hr gyms I have been to, this branch is the absolute worst in catering to anyone who wants to appreciably increase his strength. The manager at the time of this writing, matt, has this ridiculous notion that extra weight placed on top of weight stacks is dangerous. Never mind that I remove the extra weight when away from the station and never mind that I use perfect technique. Never mind that the reason his cable station gets damaged is from others who just sling the weight around (creating more shock load to the attachments).

No, this silly excuse of a manager has designs to turn this location into a castrated version of a real gym. He informed me that what I was doing was against 24hr policy. That's funny, in the all the years I've been to various 24hr clubs, I've NEVER seen anyone get this treatment for adding extra weight on a stack.

I asked him to email me the EXACT rules which prohibit this practice. I have yet to hear a peep from him. Make no mistake, this branch is run by a pathetic fool who thinks he knows strength and conditioning. The reality is, he's just another weasel that kissed the right behinds. And now that he's the club manager, he will dictate to others, at his whim, his "rules for the club" so that he has the illusion of power.

Keep playing your sad little games, matt. The end result will be that more and more members will just ridicule you while you yourself make no progress in your own physique transformation.

Or - you can wake the hell up and realize that people who are stronger than average, know proper exercise techniques and kinesiology, are NOT the ones you should go around lecturing in your impotent attempt to feel good about yourself.< /Text>< UserId.>

<date>1416693031109</date><rate>1</rate><Text>Well this has been the worst 24 hour fitness i have ever been too. I had such a hard time finding the place, i called before arriving to make sure there was free parking and Rep said YES! 2 hours. NOW why would they say that..(I had to pay) i get there n had trouble actually looking for the place itself, called again and Rep. was inpatient with me, so i just told him that i don't need his help n i will find it myself n i finally did. I get there and the place itself was not what i expected it to be. Small, not clean, and no phone reception:(.  Ugh i will never ever again go to this place. The only two 24 hour fitness i have been really happy with are ARCADIA, and LADERA AREA. This Place really needs to make some changes to most of their locations because after my membership ends i am actually thinking of changing gym's..I think the only good thing about it was the Newer machines they have at this DTWN Place other then that it SUCKS WITH A BIG "S"..</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b3b03af0f3:0xe29d7bf7982a55c1< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Im doing bodybuilding program so i just come to get my work outs done then go home, but sometimes its a drag because after work 6-7 pm lockers are filled, tons of people in the locker rooms and on the floor. I have to wait for machines too. "sauna room" smells like urine maybe because we share it with men 0.o or its the smell that comes from their bathroom. I have not explored the entire gym in the back. The parking, you must pay 1.25 after 6 in their structure. In the morning, If u go accross the street to the other structure , good luck finding the machine to pay! Other than that, I LOVE MY GYM! Clean machines..has to do with people who use them. Silly winnies, whipe your sweat off! & those guys, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, if you know you sweat a lot, and soak your shirt, bring another one so that you can change! Its gross, unsanitary, and inconsiderate. We come to work out, not to smell body odors that are not ours, literally. Staff is super friendly. Machines are broken but fixed ASAP. no one gawks at you. No one is loud and disrespectful. Everyone has their towels, just hope they use them. Very clean on the floor. Only bad thing is not 24 hrs.. I had to go to wilshire, no parking. Sunset closes at 11.. Monterey park is beautiful too! Free parking, 24 hr! Crowded though. Haaa good luck. Hope i was helpful.< /Review>< Response>

To be fair I did not even get to go in,  if you want to pay$4 for every 10 minutes you need to park underground which hard to find if you have not been here before, otherwise go down 2 blocks and park for a few bucks for 3 hours.</Review>

This gym is not well equipped, all the machines are taken and camped around, there's 2 bench presses, 2 squat racks and only 1 hole line of free weights, worst 24hr i have been too.</text>

Nan has been excellent since the very first day I came in. She explained EVERYTHING to me, even showed me 3 different spaces and I still managed to pick the wrong size. I then had the pleasure of getting a bigger size with jasmine, both ladies are very nice and very great at what they do. The app is very helpful and Nan helped me today with updating it so I could sign on with my new space. Thank you to both ladies they deserve way more than 5 stars< /Text>

I've always had a good experience at this public storage. I was at another one beforehand, and they were nice too, but I find that this public storage is a lot cleaner. The staff has always been nice, even though I've only spoke with them a few times, but the building itself looks really really nice and new, and the facilities are clean, which is the reason why I decided to choose this location. 👍<//review>

<review>Nan is amazing. She took her time, answered all my questions and made sure I was 100 percent satisfied. She walked me to my unit, the area is nice and clean I heard great things about the property manager Jasmine. Nan set me up on the app, and she never got frustrated or anything possibly the nicest person I've met, she even helped me to my car and googled the nearest CVS for me. Thank you Nan and Public Storage and I look forward to meeting Jasmine.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2b9998302cb21:0x17d9839a6248e366</GmapID></record>

Nan was so awesome a couple of days ago, she gave such great customer service. She made sure I had the right size, explained everything to me without making me feel rushed even though it was an hour before closing. The facility is big but very nice and clean, it smelled really good for a storage place lol. I got all my packing needs, and all my questions and concerns were addressed. That's just awesome, I don't know if you give out bonuses or something for this but she deserves something for making me feel so excited about something as small as renting a storage.<//Text>

Walked in scared that I wasn’t going to get a good unit but walked out a happy customer! Nan was amazing! She was kind and very patient with any questions I had. She took the time to tell me more information about the app for contactless entry to my unit. Honestly, we need more awesome customer service like hers. Thank you, Nan, for all of your help!<//text>

What a relief!! I had a emergency and needed to move my parents belongings. I called and spoke to Jasmine. She was a absolute delight despite my rambling lol. She answered all of the questions and reassured me that this will be a speedy and easy process. My parents and I came down and she made the move in very smooth. The facility is clean and we were in and out. Thanks Jasmin!!<//text>

She also has the best taste in music. We took a tour. Loved the unit. Matched the best price for me and that was that. Minor technical issues due to wack technology at check out but JASMAINE came and saved the day. Both these girls are phenomenal. I will be recommending this spot.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I went to tske some things out of my storage  unit that required the use of the carts. I went into the office to ask to use the cart which I saw 2 had been taken and 2 of them where still chained up. I was told they couldn't find the key. I waited for like 20 min to see if a cart would be returned and none where so I had to carry things by hand all the way from the second floor to vehicle all while seeing a woman having to drag heavy boxes from the same floor down to her car as well. I will be closing my account this month not worth it for how much I pay.</Review>< Pics>

But consistently over the past 6 months, I've been blown away by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff at this location. In particular, Jasmaine was incredibly helpful when I was moving out, going above and beyond to help me find takers for a desk and some filing cabinets that I couldn't fit in my car.

Bottom line: if this location is convenient for you, I highly recommend storing your goods here.< /review>< pics>

There were 3 lovely ladies today, they were cleaning and helping everyone in a timely manner. The one girl Nann helped me at my unit I asked for the other names which were Jasmine and Mya (I hope I spelled all their names correctly). This is by far the best experience with Public Storage I've ever had.<//Text>

Great team at this location Jasmaine, Marquetta, and Kenneth are awesome! I'm always greeted with a smile and the team is always eager to take care and help us with any issue! It's been about three years as a customer at this location and I'm definitely staying here! It's a delight to stop by this location, not only for the comfort of having a decent parking lot, but there a multiple elevators, and air conditioned units. Also, you know if you need help you will have it in a heartbeat .<//Text>

I needed a storage space so I could move back home to Texas for a while. The place is well run and the units are clean. The manager Jasmaine  is so friendly and helpful. She had me into my new space and completed all the paperwork in about 15 minutes, which was so great for me.< /Review>

I've had my fair sure of experiences with storage facilities being a mover/hauler for the last 10 years. Most employee at these places just sit around and are not ready to help or engage. The staff at this location are extremely friendly, polite and they never fail to put a smile on my face. Thank you Jasmaine and team!< /Text>

I am new to this facility on National in Culver City.  I am a renter as of yesterday and here are a few of my observations so far:  (1) It was much more affordable than I thought it would be, esp with the online deal. (2) Staff was responsive, well-informed, and friendly.  And (3) the facility was very, very clean.  So far so good!!!<//text>

<review>I came in to rent and Angel was such a wonderful help. He answered all of my questions and made the process smooth and simple. This is first time I've rented a storage unit so I had a lot of questions. Angel took the time to show me the different unit sizes and explained my options thoroughly. Celeste, and Ashlie were also helpful the whole experience.
Thank you!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This location totally rocks and Jasmaine and Celeste are so friendly and personable, it’s refreshing! They are very quick to resolve any situation that comes along and always make sure I’m happy! The property and units are always extremely clean, and with the 24/7 monitoring system, I know my items are safely being stored! They also offer preventative measures for pest control, which is the great! Would recommend this company to anyone, can only imagine how awesome their other locations are!</Review>

<Text>I came here and worked with Celeste who is just a gem! She was so helpful, thoughtful, carefully helped me determine what storage option was best for my needs. Through it all, she was patient, kind, and has a wonderful sense of warmth. I have never had a better experience with storage facility staff in my life! Highly recommend this facility! Great staff, great (newly renovated) office, and more affordable than other options nearby!<//Text>< Rating>

If you can help it do not store your items here. So many people have had there units broken into at this facility, and take a close look at my photos this how professionally Public storage fixes my unit after someone tried to cut through..🤔very sloppy job of fixing it...<//Review>

<Review>I came in a few weeks ago to rent a unit and was helped by Celeste. She was super patient and showed me multiple units. She also took me back to units I had already seen to make sure I was sure on the space I needed. She also gave me advice on how to maximize the space as well as explained the insurance. She was super helpful and made the whole process very easy.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b9998302cb21:0x17d9839a6248e366</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Jasmaine was very helpful and friendly. Upon arriving she greeted us and took us to see the storage unit we were inquiring about. This is our first time renting a storage unit and everything went smoothly from the time we arrived to the time we signed paperwork for rental. This location is very convenient -- they have boxes, locks, etc .. Everything to make moving fast & easy. I highly recommend this storage location ! :)< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

My husband and I LOVE the employees here..Jasmaine, Celeste, and Angel are a great team. We've had our unit for almost a year now and we've never had any issues. They are wonderful to work with! The units are very clean, love the security and gate codes used for entry. We absolutely recommend this place!<//review>

Jasmaine has always been friendly and treated us like gold.  The facility is impeccably clean and maintained, and we appreciated being able to make payments online so we didn’t have to worry about it when we were out of town. We have had storage units at other facilities in the past that were ridden with rodents and insects, it was hard to get a hold of someone if there was an issue, and we were forced to pay by check or cash. Not at this location though, also new comer to the team Celeste is  very pleasant and I love interacting with her when necessary.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

The staff here is extremely nice and I can say that I had a great time here at this public storage location.

Celeste was extremely helpful and took me through the whole process and I feel that everything was explained clearly and succinctly.

I highly recommend others to come here for their storage needs.<//review>

<review>Phone call  to the place. You can get access to the balance of the account and when is the next payment as well as paying. Go through the system and ask to talk to a normal person and not an automated system to understand whether the balance is due now or on the 1st of March. The place is rented by a former employee of us and I am trying to avoid a non-payment, just need confirmation that the balance is negative to date that I can pay the due amount. The answer I received is so weird, policy is not enabling the employee of the storage company to give me information (I got his point) but I could get so much information via the automated system and I was asking a confirmation (I have given the account number of course). Am I the only one thinking that it is weird a machine can give the information but not the human???? Looking forward to what the policy will say to this comment.</review>< Pictures>

Great Service! Fast, easy, and most importantly, CLEAN! Rented unit and received THE BEST customer service from the ladies in the office, Ashley and Jasmine. Friendly and convenient! They listened to my needs and recommended a space. They were very professional and thorough regarding what I was signing and even went above and beyond to accommodate some specific requests. I felt like they were very determined to earn my business. I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a secured facility, reasonable rates, and a great team of people who make you feel appreciated as a customer. Couldn't recommend them enough.

Five stars*****!< /Review>

The office representatives Jasmaine and Celeste  at Public Storage are amazing! They're super helpful and they didn't try to add in hidden charges or fees. The facility is very secure and very clean as well.  I got a pretty good deal on my moving boxes also.< /text>

<text>The employees usually don't seem too interested in their jobs or helping customers. It's a good location. The front door sometimes has problems opening and even though we've reported it, it doesn't seem to matter. We did have a break in in one of our storage units. When we stumbled upon our lock, the staff acted ho hum about it and said that they were just about to call us. Highly doubtful since the breakin happened a couple days before.< /text><Time>1579642494514</Time><username>H Day (HappyDayProductions)</username><Rating>1< /Rating><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp></record>

How do you not have later hours? It’s an automated access facility. Why make it so hard for customers to access outside of work hours? It’s terribly bad customer experience for such a high margin business.</text>

The manager Jasmaine, was as helpful and polite as I could have hoped for. She took me around to the unit I was interested in and showed a total understanding of how to fit my items from my house into the unit. I could not have asked for anything more than the service I received at Public Storage. I will recommend this facility to anyone who asks me about where I stored my house. Definitely the best place for self storage.<//review>

I did the express check in online, and when I got to the place the whole process took maybe 15 minutes to be out the door. Super easy. Quetta assisted me and she was knowledgable and friendly. So was her co-worker, but I didn't catch her name. Thank you!<//Text>

The employees at this location are amazing! They are always willing to help, and provide great customer service. I had the pleasure of renting with the manager Jasmaine. She was great, very knowledgeable of all policies and procedures, polite, and respectful. I’ll continue to store with Public Storage and be a valuable customer as long the employees appreciate their customers like they do here!! Stop by check out their storage spaces, you won’t be disappointed.<//Review>

We had a great experience on a difficult day! This storage facility is clean, well run, helpful and has great parking. Kevin was our check in representative and did a fantastic job. Imani showed us everything we needed to know and was super positive. Storage isn't fun, but this was super easy and really pleasant :)<//review>

Ok, so getting a storage unit is supposed to suck, right? Not here if you get Celeste! She was super helpful, patient, accommodating, efficient, and generally, fun and nice to chat with. Celeste, thank you for making this such a seamless and even enjoyable experience!< /review>

This has been the most pleasant visit working with storage units...last month I was at ExtraSpace and they just treated me like a number, unlike when I came here; Celeste made it feel like I was moving into "Home".< /review>< userid>

My experience at this location has been nothing but the best customer service.  The manager here is so full of knowledge and is very attentive.  I would recommend this place.  Always clean and great customer service.<//Text>

<Text>A nice clean facility located in a quiet part of Culver City (Hayden Tract). The staff is always very helpful and friendly. It is climate controlled which is important to me. Not perfect, the elevators can be clunky, access keypad has got stuck, and I've only seen two carts to borrow.< /Text>< Date>

Thank you Kye, for  exceptional service. This  is why I was happy to refer a friend to use their service.  They are honest about their prices,  take the time to show you units, and discuss pricing options.  The storage is clean with a location ,big enough access from your cars to access to unit. I have used many other facilities, consistent non aggressive service is peace of mind. Thanks again Kye.</Review>

I always have trouble remembering my code and I am always assisted by Brianna, who is always very patient with me. She also had no problem answering questions for me about the moving out process.

Good price and friendly, helpful customer service. Jackie and James M were very kind and helpful while I waited for my movers, letting me plug in my phone and sit in their office. The location is convenient and the process to rent the unit is smooth. I have a 10x10 climate controlled unit that was a better price than I found for smaller units at other nearby storage places.<//text>

<review>We just got back from renting a 10x15 ground floor space. After checking with 4 other locations in the area, this was by far the best staffed and cleanest one by far. Kenyon helped us and she was so kind and patient with us, she is the best. Honest and friendly she showed my wife several spaces and was always so helpful. I would recommend this location by far over the other spots in the area. Make sure you ask for Kenyon.........she really cares.</review>< Pictures>

Kye and Jasmaine are OUTSTANDING!!! Best customer service I have had in quite some time. My experience at this location was beyond what I expected. The facility itself was clean and easy to access. There was a ton of room to park and move around. Rates are satisfying as well.<//Review>

Above and beyond customer service. Very helpful staff Jasmine and Ashley are awesome! Stellar help with my moving and storage issues and went WAY out of their way to help me. Employees like them aren’t valued enough. Clean facility but the staff makes it. Would give 10 stars if I could!<//Review>

My family just relocated from Texas and the staff here was so helpful, they helped to make our storage transition was smooth. We worked with Jasmaine, Nyshell, and Jenica today all three ladies were very friendly and professional, you can tell they care about their customers. I will recommend this location to anyone.< /Text>

I went to this location specifically because it always has such great people working there and yesterday when I went to buy some boxes, I was not disappointed as I knew I wouldn't be. Shanice helped me out and even carried my boxes to the car for me. Always such great customer service here which makes me keep coming back.<//Review>

<text>Public Storage is clean, secure and has very spacious storage units. The representatives Jasmaine and Kye were very helpful. They explained in detail how to use the storage and was patient with me despite the fact that I walked in close to closing on Saturday. They have cameras and security codes. I feel safe when I come here, especially in the evenings after work. I would definitely recommend this location for your storage needs. Also, the new girls Jenica and Nyshell was very friendly.<//text>< pictures>

I went to this location specifically because it always has such great people working there and yesterday when I went to buy some boxes, I was not disappointed as I knew I wouldn't be. Shanice helped me out and even carried my boxes to the car for me. Always such great customer service here which makes me keep coming back.< /text>

Public Storage is clean, secure and has very spacious storage units. The representatives Jasmaine and Kye were very helpful. They explained in detail how to use the storage and was patient with me despite the fact that I walked in close to closing on Saturday. They have cameras and security codes. I feel safe when I come here, especially in the evenings after work. I would definitely recommend this location for your storage needs. Also, the new girls Jenica and Nyshell was very friendly.< /Review>

The manager Jasmaine was very friendly and easy to work with.  I let her know I only needed storage for a month or two and she was very accommodating.  I was not expecting to get such a great space at an affordable price, but Jasmaine was able to help me out.</text>

Today I went in to pay on my mothers account and I was assisted by Brianna and Tre. Really awesome service! Brianna was very helpful in providing me with different ways to pay the rent instead of having to drive down here from the Valley. The property was also very clean and well-Kept. I really appreciate their kindness.<//Review>

<Text>We got a storage unit here with a lock and no more than 1 month later it was broken into. We were told that they do daily lock checks but we received a call about a fraudulent charge 4 days after the unit was broken into. Public Storage did not notify us that our unit was broken into, and so the unit was left unlocked for several days. When we went to investigate what happened, they informed us that they only have cameras in the front of the building, no where else. When we had questions about procedure and how to continue, we were told to call the district manager in a few days. I was very unsatisfied with how Public Storage handled this unfortunate event. And beware of break ins at this location!</Text><UserId.>104323331872354504179</UserId.>< date>

From the first phone call for info to moving in was a very pleasant experience.
Jasmaine was very helpful and explained everything in detail.
She was extremely friendly and even made a follow up call to see if there were any problems and said she would be available to contact if there were.
I wish all businesses had an employee like her.< /review>

Sadly but true this location has went extremely down hill! There has been small fires and break ins and because my unit wasn’t compromised I wasn’t made aware- which is extremely unfair when you pay a monthly fee for safety and access to unit and you have no communication from staff on events taken place! An email or letter would work just for feeling of safety and security of knowing- yes these events have taken place but public storage has control or do they not have control??? While visiting several times my partner and I have walked into homeless in building or parked outside living life as if this was not a building renters have access to even after business hours! One guy went as far as trying to get on elevator with my partner I which we became extremely uncomfortable and forced to leave! Just a week ago the doors again we’re not opening properly causing serval of us to wait outside until staff member arrived- who were also late! With all these events and serval more why would it be smart to increase the rate of your renters? I have no trust and safety is a huge concern. If hours are posted we should be available to access our units and not have to wait for staff- this has become very upsetting for me!<//text>

Customer service is still great!!

I want to take time out of my day to thank Jasmaine the manager there. I forgot to put my lock on my storage space because I was in a such a hurry to pick up my niece from school.  She called me within an hour of me leaving to notify me that she put a lock on the space and that my belongings were secure until I came back to the property. Without her doing that I don't know what would've happened to my stuff. I appreciate that fast acting customer service. Thanks again Jasmaine!</Text>

I went in to pay my sisters bill for another property and I was kindly helped by Jasmine and Brayon. They both were very awesome characters and very outgoing. I am actually interested my self in getting a storage since I am moving place, I need extra room to store things I don't want at home. Jasmine was very helpful in showing me some units and pricing. She also helped in deciding what moving packs ima need to store my things properly and neatly. I am definitely going back for the unit and packing supplies I am going to need.<//Text>

This was my first time needing storage so ive also thought it would be a hassel and tons of paper work, however the Ladies @ this Facility Kye and Jasmaine made everything so easy, this public storage is clean and well lit, not spooky like I assumed.....Thanks ladies for all your help! I will be recommending this public storage to everyone!</review>

<review>I must say that I was treated REAL NICE, by a Professional Receptionist name Nailah, and she took me the unit and was quick, knowledgeable, courteous, and she KNOWS the LIGHTING of the Hallways in the storage Facility. I recommend  this place as it is clean, and again talk to Nailah about renting or leasing a unit,, and great price,,,, Thank You</review>< gmap_id>

Went in to inquire about storage units and was pleasantly assisted by a pretty young lady by the name of Kimberly. Not only was she professional and lovely, but she was efficient and answered all of my questions with full knowledge of what she had available. I will definitely recommend this location to people I know.</text>

<review>The staff here are AWESOME!  From the very fist visit with Trey, my communication with Jasmine the manager, and my interaction with Camisha.  They have all been so helpful and professional.  I was really nervous about changing storage facilities.  I had a great relationship with the staff at my old facility.  I like the idea of seeing familiar faces every time I go.  I have fond from my visits that Camisha is an extremely professional and helpful representative.  She is always there when I visit and always greets me with a smile.  She is always very eager to assist and always takes the time to see how my day/week has been.  I really appreciate this service because it makes me feel appreciated and gives me the extra confidence that my property is in safe storage.< /review>< Pics>

<text>Today we received EXCELLENT service from employees Jasmaine and Denise.  Jasmaine processed our rental.  She was pleasant, efficient, and complete.  Denise beautifully came to our assistance when she volunteered to return to the storage unit to place the key on; my sister who had just gotten out of the hospital was extremely fatigued.  This was very kind of her--no hesitation what so ever.  Both ladies were very friendly and helpful.  Excellent service with a smile!  The facility was very clean also.  Thank you!<//text></record>

Having to move soon, I was stressed about what to do with all of our stuff while we are in transit.  Luckily, I stopped by public storage and met two very friendly and helpful staff (Kenyon and Wendy).  The were very patient and answered all of my questions and even took me on a tour to show me units.  My random stop turned into a solid plan and I am now and much less stressed.

It was really refreshing to have such great customer service, especially right before closing on a Sunday.

Now I can't wait to move!

Thanks PS!<//Review>

<text>Ken'yon was really helpful.  I was transferring units and she helped me find a unit on the same floor as my existing unit.  She was friendly throughout the time I was there in trying to figure out what size unit I wanted to get.  Very patient and a great disposition.< /text><user_id>109744318577419644080</user_id>< date>

Long story short James and Kim were the perfect team to help me and my mom! I means from the time we walked up until we left they were more than helpful. We were very satisfied here, the place was so clean and it smelled good. James stated helping us and Kim finished up with us so James could help someone else. My mom wants to give more stars lol but I told her only 5 are available. Thank you thank you thank you because at a time like this we as renters need people like James and Kim to help us through it. Y'all are super dope and my mom says " y'all the bomb" Hahahaha< /review>

This location gets five stars solely because of Jasmaine's excellent and consistent service. I've had three units here and she is always helpful, informative & friendly. This location has a clean climate controlled building (hot on the 4th floor). I've rented units on the 1st & 2nd floors.  I upgraded to a larger space when my monthly 5x5 price increased close to the 10x5 price; literally the next unit over.  However, after 6 months the fee increased an additional $50/month so I moved units to the 2nd floor for a lower price.  I've paid three admin fees total during each move due to the price bumps. It's difficult to reach the regional manager/director.

My grievances are:
1. there's only 1 day in the month in which a customer is able to move without being double charged, for two entire months (bad new policy for customers - absolutely no pro-rate)
2.  there's admin fees associated for changing units
3. every 6 months rent increases for customers
4. no access to moving carts after 6pm (threw out my back because of the additional lifting & carrying).

Best notes about this facility (random order):
1. Clean building
2. Climate controlled
3. Jasmaine< /text>

I just started working in the nearby area so having a storage unit takes a lot of responsibility on my end. Today was my first time actually stopping by the front desk for help and although I felt that I had a lot of questions, thankfully people like Jasmaine, Imani, and Ashley were patient enough to assist me. Im now on my way to get some storage shelves with wheels due to their help to make my unit more convenient. Appreciate all of the help.<//review>

<name>Rebekah Brown<//name><date>1470781851204< /date><review>Clearing out of this place was a HUGE problem. Turns out there were break-ins, including my unit and the unit next to mine. Too bad I didn't find that out until right now because the way this business is run is shady and incompetent.

I came to my storage unit to pick up my bike. One front desk clerk told me that Public Storage had cut my lock because I was late on a payment. It seemed weird to me at the time, because when I had paid the month before, the woman on the phone told me that we weren't close to the timeframe of a lien. Anyway, the clerk told me that replacing the lock would be a $19 charge. Since it was cheaper for me to pro-rate my balance for the month and move out, I decided to do that. I was already pretty over this place at this point. I asked her if I needed to turn in my keys. She told me that I didn't need to, since the lock had been cut, and I could just throw them away. I paid my balance and came back two days later to move.

Well, it turns out that my lock hadn't been cut. Another lock had just been placed over it. Once they took the outer lock off, my original lock was underneath, except now I had no keys to open it. The clerk apologized and told me they'd cut my lock that night and I could come back the following day to clear out. She said she'd call me with a confirmation, which she never did.

I returned the next day anyway. My lock hadn't been cut. The clerk I'd spoken to the day before wasn't there, so a different person tried to reach the manager in charge of cutting the lock while I waited. After an hour, I gave up and asked if I could come back the next day. They assured me I could. They called me an hour later to tell me the lock had just been cut and I could return the next morning.

When I arrived, however, a third time, the lock still had not been cut. At this point, I was angry and my boyfriend was angry, because we'd been driving over an hour from where we live to come clear out of the unit. The clerk again called the manager to come cut the lock. Again, we waited. The manager arrived. My boyfriend, who was irate by this point, gets into screaming match with her.  She threatens to call the police and refuses to cut the lock, telling us to call a locksmith. I take him outside to calm down, and go back inside to offer a genuine apology to the manager and the clerk for the argument.

The manager agreed to cut my lock as long as my boyfriend wasn't present. We cut the lock, and I begin clearing out my unit. But...It looks funny. Things are thrown all over the place and all of the boxes have been opened. Stuff is definitely missing. At this point, I don't want to deal with another confrontation, and I'm really eager to get out of there. After I load everything into a cart, I notice that the fencing that normally covers the ceiling has been cut and bent back on the entire back side of the unit. Looks like a break in to me!

I go back downstairs and talk to yet another front desk clerk, explaining to him that it looks like my unit was broken into. He comes upstairs with me to verify and agrees. He explains that a month or so earlier, a man was caught breaking into the units on my floor. The unit next to mine had its front lock broken and he probably climbed over through the ceiling into mine. Insurance MIGHT cover my missing items, but also maybe not since THEY CANCELLED my insurance after my late payment (never mind the fact that when I paid the balance in full, they also charged extra for the late payment).

So, the clerk verifies my move-out (finally!), he gives me some insurance info for the break-in, and I go home. Pretty sucky situation. I already wish I'd never used Public Storage and am just so glad I never have to go back. Well, I get a phone call about an hour after I get home from the front desk. The clerk asks if I want him to close out my account. In order to do so, he says, I need to pay the balance on my unit. Ugh. I tell him that three different people have told me I don't owe any money for the days I waited. I have to drive again back for the receipt. THE WORST.<//review>< UserId.>

Update: Jasmaine is still here and she is just as kind as she was before! Thank you for the great customer service.

I came in on the 30th looking for storage because my other storage company is going out of business. I was greeted by the manager Jasmaine, she was so kind and knowledgable. She made sure she went over everything in detail and explained this new facility to me and my husband. We look forward to storing here for a couple years, thanks Jasmaine.</Review>

The manager said he never talked to me about the prorated, and he mad at me, keep telling me verbal agreement is illegal. They don't care about their customer at all. This business is such a liar.

<review>THEFT!!!

This storage facility has been broken into 3x in the last year. They pried open my 5x10 unit and stole 2x electric guitars, 1x mac book pro, and 1x suitcase. The employees did not seem to care. They told me to call the police. No compensation and no apologies. Moved out as soon as possible.

Note: They do not have dollies or carts available before the office opens at 9:30am and after the office closes at 6pm. They make you buy there locks which is not returnable.<//review><name>Erik Pedtke</name>< response>

I always come here and never had a problem until now. Customer service was bad. just right now I came to full my gas tank and then I asked for air and the guy with the glasses said no that I need to put coins. When other gas stations give you free air when you full your tank. I always come here but this is the last time I come here. Not only that but the worker was rude as well. Bad customer service. This time I really needed the air and I was rejected and I don’t think is fair. Last time I come here. Not even Arco says no and that’s one of the cheapest gas station. Smh< /Review>

(Translated by Google) They should have a security guard because there are always homeless brunettes asking for money and you don't know when one of them is going to go crazy and attack you, this makes me feel insecure when I'm pouring gas.

Deberían de tener un guardia de seguridad por que siempre hay morenos sin hogar pidiendo dinero y no sabes cuándo uno de ellos se va poner loco y te ataque, esto me hace sentir inseguro cuando estoy echando gasolina.<//Review>

Not sure what going on, but I love this place. I hope they get back on their feet soon I will definitely be back to support them. The owner Gina is a great person I wish her and the business the best!< /text>

I used to love this place, but they are currently going through a partner split. As a result, they currently have no alcohol. They were also out of crawdads, king crab, and red snapper. I visited Friday at noon, so I'm not sure why they weren't stocked for the weekend.
The service was fantastic and the food was excellent, except some of the shrimp we're mushy.</text>

<Review>Food was excellent.  Try the gumbo if you're there.  Also, their wings were good, both the lemon pepper and the Cajun ones.  Finally, the staff was super helpful and gave us samples of their sauces (made fresh to order).  Go with the garlic sauce, you won't regret it!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c367e8e838dd6d:0xe3b39a5ee053cba2<//Gmap_id></record>

<date>1440283422369<//date><Resp>None</Resp><Text>First time trying it today. I will never go again. I'm used to going  to the Boiling Crab, down the hill in Garden Grove, where the serviceand food are great.
The food tasted old and the service was horrible. My son's food finally came after asking three times for it and everyone in the group was about done with their food. One waitress was to busy talking to a group of people that were the same nationality as she was. Just absolutely rude. Anyways, never again!

There are two stores in the high desert. Gumbo, shrimp and crab legs.  Place directly on the wax like paper. Great place for the gang to meet. Some seafood are subject to market pricing.</review>

<text>The food was amazing! Fresh and very flavorful. I've never had that style of food so I was pleasantly surprised. Restaurant atmosphere was great, clean, well decorated, HD tv's to watch games and staff was hard working & helpful.  Beer selection was excellent, especially since they had one of my favorite beers on tap; red trolley from Carl Strauss.<//text>< Pictures>

I ordered the shrimp PO boy, it came with coleslaw and Cajun fries, the fries were the best part. The sandwich had a total of 4 shrimp on it, just enough to call it a shrimp PO boy. the top layer of the sandwich was slathered in coleslaw which was heavy on dressing and light in cabbage, I had to take it off. Their menu is convoluted in its layout and just about nothing has a set price. Which is fine But what's the point of your menu if I have to check the giant blackboard anyways?
The fried pickles are amazing and netted them 1/2 another star, the atmosphere is pretty nice too. 1/2 star,  this rating is based on the po boy sandwich. If you can't deliver a good po boy, don't offer it.<//text>

After waiting 10 minutes for them to find us seats. (With 80% of the restaurant open) After 20 minutes of sitting we were then served watered down iced tea and flat soda by the barback. Another 20 minutes passed and our waiter showed up. (The bartender) Food was great but nothing even close to our first visit there. Don't know if I'll be back again.<//Review>

Had over boiled shrimp, got the spiciest flavor and had to flag down a lady(not our server because our server ignored us) who tried to ignore me as well, for more water. Then our daughter left her new books she had gotten for her birthday and somehow they disappeared when we returned to get them. The servers are a joke. I won't be coming back here and im really upset my daughters books went mis sing.< /text>

Food temperature was not warm. We received our gumbo after we finished our meal. $120 Bill for 3 not worth the value. Overpriced too.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
Consistently the best food and service ever experienced.
20 piece Ranch Lemon Pepper is a personal reminder that life can be a beautiful and delicious!
Highly recommended!
Order prepared by Rosie. Nothing better.<//Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Extremely friendly staff. Any staff will greet you with a hello and a smile and they do compensate you for their mistakes. I do recommend ordering ahead of time as I've noticed that the mobile pick-ups are in and out. Literally. I've just received my order within such a lunch rush! Erwin, Rosie, Ryan, and Ed not only kept their composure, focus, and warm welcoming during but they killed that rush hour! While tending to us walk-ins, they still sent the mobile orders out on time. While waiting indoors, at a max capacity of ten (pandemic capacity), they provide sweet tunes. Plus, if you have kids that could use a distraction, there's a beautiful fish pond right outside.<//Review><rating>5< /rating><name>baby girl<//name>< Time>

Great place, for really good wings! I would have rated this five stars, however if you place your order online or over the phone, when picking up there is no separate line for those that are picking up, and for those that are currently trying to place their order. This is a problem because some people who have already placed an order stand in the line to place an order. Also, for those that are picking up, no real line is formed, you just wait around until someone acknowledges you. Other than this, I highly recommend!< /Review>

The two front desk girls were awesome. I ordered the 10 piece bone in and boneless wings for my office  and the girls give me great customer service. 10 out of 10. I will be back, but most importantly I recommend everyone to drive to this location. They treat you like family.</Review>

<Review>I don’t know why they stop taking order at 9pm when the store hours say 10pm. They don’t even have a sign announcing that last order is at 9pm. You should update that info on all your platforms. (Google,Yelp, etc...)</Review>< pictures>

Update 3/12/2021
I see workers not wearing their face mask properly.  Especially the guy at the register, and he keeps touching his mask to pull it up but does not sanitize his hands.  If you must touch your mask to adjust, then you must sanitize your hands after!  Also. invest in a mask that fits.  Disappointed on this visit.  As far as the food, what I normally order usually tastes good.  But because of seeing this, I have to give a lower score.</Review>

<review>Who doesn't love hot wings? Well, even if you don't like em' hot you have plenty of other options flavor wise to choose from. I'd call ahead or order through the app unless you don't mind a 10min wait. And I recommend you ask if they have any deals or offers going on to get the most of your money. Id also say the Original hot, Hickory Smoked BBQ, and Cajun flavors are the best in my opinion.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Ordered lemon pepper chicken combo and neither chicken or fries had seasoning on it. What a big disappointment and turn off. I will just wait to continue to travel and purchase from Wingstop in City of Gardena off Rosecrans. Employees there know how to savor the food. I’m never disappointed when buying from that location.</Text>

🚫🚫!TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!🚫🚫
IF YOU CANT WORK WELL IN CUSTOMER SERVICE GET OUT OF THE POSITION.
NO communication, terrible lack of multi tasking by front(lacking customer reassurance of concern ect), could have offered ppl to get drinks as they make u wait 52 min for a 20 min order, no manager in sight to mitigate frustration when they know ppl are waiting longer than told, no updates to visually frustrated customers from the woman up front giving out very late orders, with an attitude when asked for the drink as if this certain "she" was doing somebody a favor by giving drink already prepaid for while waiting for very late order, the "we're backed up excuse is old"  MORE BODIES, and more efficiency, better skilled people in the proper* places.  I should have read reveiws first.  Rather go way to the banning-beumont store. Other customers mumbled about the lack of concern, interaction, and efficiency.  Redlands is growing and there are too many other worthy options these days to settle for the terrible customer service, and the inaccurate wait times posted online need to change and give more candid service time. Was the last straw, WONT EVER return. Great job(NOT)</text>

Took a while to order and get our food  The wings were pretty decent, but the mild buffalo wings had absolutely no spice whatsoever. The garlic parmesan were kinda oily towards the end. Not a bad price and I'll try it again. I'll try something a little spicier next time.</review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>This is the best WingStop I've ever been to. Note this is a little bit of a late review, by a couple months. Let me preface this by saying I'm from San Diego and we have several locations but they aren't in the best of areas and/or have staffing with the worst attitudes and terrible customer service skills.

With all that said, this location had some friendly staff who were very accommodating from the moment that I arrived to the moment I left.

The food was fresh... Now I know in all locations the food is always "made fresh".. but for some reason the wings and tenders at this location were more satisfying. The chicken was juicier and the sauces didn't taste watered down. The buffalo tenders were super sauced up and the lemon pepper/ parmesan wings had that heavy rub action. In fact, it reminded me of our first Wing Stop when it originally opened in San Diego. Even the fries took me back to my original experience.

They even had their drink supply fully loaded which is hard to come by in San Diego. When I order a combo they don't have anything yo drink other than sparkling water.

Last but not least the prices at this location are a little bit lower than what I'm used to paying. Which was just a bonus.

All in all, I couldn't find anything wrong on my visit. Thank you!<//Text>< time>

I am extremely upset with this place, cause I ordered right after they opened so I could have fresh wings for a watch party I was having. Only to be disappointed for never receiving my order!! Called them and was told they gave it to doordash and wasn't responsible for the order. So I'll never order from here again period.... VERY ANGRY CUSTOMER 😠</text>

Food is good but very Poor customer service.
This lady kayla was mean and lazy. Told me to wait for 18mins, after 18mins i ask her if my order was ready, she told me just wait and somebody will call you. So i waited for another 15mins and ask her again, my order was already done the first time i ask her and it was just sitting there. It was not busy and she was doing nothing while The other lady was working very hard, cooking and preparing some order.< /text>

<Text>The food is great and the flavors are pretty nice too, although most aren't that spicy. The prices for the amount of food that you'll get are great in my opinion. It's great to see such friendly and helpful staff. I will be coming back here to eat again!< /Text>< Pictures>

Placed a carry out order. boneless wings were great but Fries were soggy and whole wings were skimpy/odd shaped(added picture) and soo greasy. Took them home and put them in the broiler, added some salt to the fries and they were a little better.<//Text>

<review>Everyone was very nice and professional. The ultasound tech was willing to check me even though she was not sure if I had waited long enough.  I was lucky and was still able to do the test.  Trust me when you have to have a bladder ultrasound, you really do not want to reschedule and torture yourself twice.<//review><UserId.>116609652813675179893</UserId.><date>1617046373784</date></record></dataset><record>

<time>1611166810826</time><rating>5</rating><text>They went above and beyond for me today. I was seen in Barstow which is far for me. Nonetheless I enjoyed my early morning drive. I was off from work and my doctor wrote my request form wrong. However, the young lady at the front desk was amazing. She called my doctor's office and got a verbal okay to change it. The young lady who did my screening was amazing too. I would definitely budget visit or go there again to get any screening done. They were very polite and professional 😄👍!!<//text>< Pictures>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Horrible experience! Went in for X-rays of multiple body parts so could not schedule an appointment. Walked into office with every seat full and several patients waiting outside. There was no sign in sheet. Then the printer was not printing. Then the computers were freezing. By the time my paperwork came up the  lady not so kindly informed me of the 1 X-ray I was there for. I politely informed her that I was there for multiple X-rays and she said no you’re not just the 1. I didn’t argue with her as it had been well over an hour. I called my dr office to confirm the X-ray order and was informed of the multiple X-rays they requested. The lady at the desk then said oh I see them now, somebody must’ve put them in wrong. A patient who arrived after me for X-rays was seen before me. And I had to subsequently call my dr office again to have them fax the initial request in again because the lady didn’t see 1 of the body parts that I named. Next time I’ll just make the 20 minute drive to Apple Valley/Victorville and will still be done and back in less than the 2 hours this appointment took. 😡</text><Rate>1< /Rate><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Today I had a stressful situation.  I let the Nice Man Know My concerns. He handed me papers to fill out. Assuring me it would be fine. He looked over my papers. Going out of his way to help me with phone # and what to Ask for. I was able to settle all my Concerns. Both Men in the Office were professional, and really went off the scales will 101% Excellent Service. Its not enough to just satisfy customers. You need to impress them, & I Was Impressed.

<review>Much better than the last time I was there. There were two young men there before who were totally unprofessional. But this time was great. Not only was there no waiting but the people were great. They willfully sent my results to two doctors my general practitioner and my specialist. I can recommend this place easily.</review><time>1558135472387< /time>< user>

Very disappointed that they didn't care about The uncomfortable situation we have to indure.< /Text>< Pics>

Wish it had been noted on website that the facility is upstairs, daughter is in a wheel chair and of course the building has no elevator, so we had to load her back up into the car, and drive around to the upper level to Park.

Office is clean, front desk guy wasn’t the friendliest.

Tech was rude, tried saying that we probably couldn’t do the X-rays there and may need to see a special facility, because of the X-rays she needed, when I explained she was fine to do the X-rays there, he then said “Well she shouldn’t have X-rays like this (due to the movement of her legs) until a month or two after surgery ( she’s 5 weeks post op.) I then argued that she moves her legs like that for PT, he tried to reiterate his previous statement, it wasn’t until I told him “I don’t think her Orthopedic Surgeon would have requested these specific X-rays, if he didn’t think she could do them”, the tech finally stopped arguing with me, and took her back, it took 7 minutes and her legs moved just fine for the X-rays needed, I understand being cautious, but this isn’t our first time having trouble with this company (not just in Barstow)

I feel like some of their employees are absolutely amazing and well, others are lazy and just incompetent, and some of the companies policies are absolutely ridiculous, and make it hard for people who live in a small town, to get the accurate images and care that are needed.< /text>

Very friendly and quick service. Very efficient! Just had a renal ultrasound .. the trainee and the lead tech were both extremely efficient and kind. And everything is so clean and professional ❣‼‼‼
Update:  just went for a Pre-op chest xray and they are so professional and super clean!! And yet you feel welcome and confident in your care. ❤<//Text>

It was a great atomsphere to be at. I felt very comfortable doing the ultrasound that I almost fell asleep by how relaxed I was. The lady was very nice and helpful to receive information from. I’d recommend coming to this place to receive an ultrasound.< /Text>

I showed up unannounced and there was a 25-minute wait and was told to come back when they open and there would be no wait. I did that the following day and everyone was very nice to me and took care of the x-rays on both of my knees. Very nice people.</review>

Main Street Advance#d Imaging in Barstow,.CA.   is very professional,  the workers are always polite,  I would use them again,  and they try to get you in and out very quickly.     I give them 10stars but they only offer 5 stars.  5 stars all the way< /review>

<Review>Went in today at 2:30 pm.  They are suppose to close at 5PM.  Well guess what?   They must have decided to start their weekend early.  The place was closed with a sign in the door saying they would be back at 8.   At the very least they should ask people to call before they come in just to make sure they are opened for business.<//Review>< pics>
