< Review>
I used SD Carpet Repair for carpet stretching. I also contacted another company for the same job and was told that the job could not be done because of the furniture in my room.
Jeff was very responsive in returning my calls and providing an estimate over the phone.  His team, Andy and Jerry did a great job stretching my carpet. Thank you for your professionalism, great service and fair price.<//Review>

SD Carpet cleaned the area rugs in our home, one of which I thought was unsalvageable. The quality of work was exceptional, laced with great communication topped with a sense of humor. Highly recommend!</Review>

Jeff ensured we were taken care of as quickly as his schedule allowed.  He even call me when an earlier appointment was cancelled and took care of us even faster than we expected.  He showed up when he said he would.  He found the best solution for our issue.  I'm sure he could have "snowed" us and done a much more expensive solution, but he kept the work efficient, effective, and within our budget.  I recommend San Diego Carpet to my friends and I will use them again.</Text>

<userid>104131526763051367136</userid><username>Jon Carey< /username><time>1503090555827<//time><rating>5< /rating><Review>After having two other companies with five star ratings make an attempt at cleaning my carpet I decided to give Jeff a shot at it before spending $3,000 to $4,000  for replacement. It was the opinion of everyone that I should just rip it out because it was beyond cleaning.
My wife and I inherited our Grandson and it didn't take long before it was
in really bad shape.
I spoke to Jeff on the phone and told him that I was pretty much reserved to the idea I was going to need to replace it.
He told me he was sure he could bring it a stage of looking much better than it did and I decided to go with it and I'm glad I did.
i will tell you here and now save yourself time and money go straight to Jeff do not pass go.This guy and his crew are the best of the best. I have used many companies prior to Jeff and one of them for 15 years. I also ran a handyman business for 10 years and referred that company to my clients. They were good but I now have discovered they weren't the best.
Although my carpet is not perfect it does look almost as good as new and certainly does not need replacement. One has to be looking hard to find any areas that show dirt stains. And I do mean hard.
Thanks Jeff for everything</Review>< pictures>

Outstanding work done by San Diego Carpet Repair and Cleaning.  I needed my carpets in three rooms stretched. as well as a deep cleaning in a number of other rooms.  I talked to a few providers, but no one could do both the stretching and cleaning for a reasonable price.   San Diego Carpet Repair & Cleaning met and exceeded expectations.   Pricing was fair and upfront.  Arrival was prompt.  Appearance was professional.  Attitude and work ethic was great!  Work was done in a timely manner.  Most of all...my carpets looked like they were new again.  I would highly recommend and use again San Diego Carpet Repair and Cleaning!<//text>

Like others have said - these guys are so courteous and do an efficient job cleaning. I had them come out to clean a sectional that smelled like dogs and they were in and out in an hour and arrived on time! It was $210 for my microfiber 90x90 'L' shape sectional and I'm thinking its going to be well worth it - the piece smells good (and has continued smelling good over the past couple weeks).<//review>

I called this company because i saw so many reviews and boy was i wrong! They show up an hour late! We had originally agreed on a price of $150 but when the tech arrived he stated that he would have to charge me extra for each of the stains on my carpet. Agreed and the job ended up costing me $250! talk about bait and switch!!! It has been 3 days now and my carpet is still WET! and now there is a bad odor in my home! The stains that i paid an extra $100 for also came back! I now have to contact another company to see if they can fix this problem!</Text>

I told Jeff he should change the name of his company to "Magic Carpet."
The response time from our first call was rapid and they were able to schedule the repairs within days. Good people. Good work. Use them.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Date>

There is no doubt this is a 5 star carpet repair, carpet and furniture cleaning. The best by far of any company we have used.  Top of the line equipment that also makes a big difference. Very fair pricing and all about customer service. If you use them once you will use them again.< /Review>

<review>Very happy. Arrived on time, replaced 2 stained areas of carpet with some remnants I had, then cleaned it. Excellent work! Hard to see where the repairs were done.

<Text>For the last 10 years Jeff (aka "Doctor K") has been my go-to carpet guy - for repair and cleaning. As a real estate professional, I need a small army of professional service providers at my disposal because clients are always asking me for reliable service providers. San Diego Carpet Repair is highly recommended. And I must say, it's great to have the option to REPAIR carpet, instead of just cleaning or replacing it. Typically, this saves $$$thousands! It's a great tool to have in your professional tool belt.

Jeff, the owner, is a top notch guy with character, integrity and a hard work ethic. He'll make sure the job is done right, and in my experience he under-promises and over-delivers, the reverse of what you normally experience. After using him, he'll be your go-to guy too!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Jeff at San Diego Carpet Repair did an amazing job repairing our carpet! We had a 4"x6" bleach stain in a high traffic area, and he was able to repair beautifully - it now looks good as new! Jeff's service was fast and friendly, and he is a real professional. I would highly recommend San Diego Carpet Repair.<//text>

<review>Jeff and his partner were fast, professional and productive. After 3 1/2 years of teenagers, dogs, a cat and people in and out my carpets were looking as if replacement was the only option. Jeff saw to it that restoration was the only way needed. After a short hour, maybe a little more my carpets looked amazing. Thanks San DIego Carpet Repair, you did great work!</review>< userid>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Yes, this guy is good.  I had some sort of discoloration/fading spots on my very expensive carpet.  Jeff came over, showed up on time, checked my carpet and said he would give one spot a try but told me not to expect a good result. Jeff worked on the spot with a custom dye mixture for about 15 minutes, told me to let it dry over night.  The next day the spot was completely gone and was to me a near perfect match. He returned and finished the other dozen spots and then completely cleaned the carpet.  The carpets are totally restored and look like new. Hire him, you won't be disappointed.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Jeff and his partner were very professional and got the job done right!  I had a previous problem with my berber carpet and had used someone else which resulted in a bad experience.  To this day I can still tell where the repair was done.   With that said, it takes a certain skill to repair berber and Jeff and his team definitely have that skill set!  You can't even tell that the carpet was torn in numerious places.

One last thing, as his partner was helping me move my couch back unfortunately the leg ruined anothe spot of my berber.  I didnt' even have to ask them, they just immediatly brought their equipment back in to repair it for no additional cost.

Thank you both!  I wil difinitely call on you guys again!</Text>

Rolled up to this winery at 9:59am. And they were super duper awesome. Got a tasting. Then an extra tasting. Then a small tour. Which was very informative. Who knew Zinfandel plants were so unruly. And from Croatia. A few bottles on tour. Nice, cool barrel room. Friendly folks. Some small food at the tasting room.< /text>

This was the perfect ending to our day in wine country. It was peaceful and beautiful. We sat on the patio and had a delicious platter paired with the best Moscato I have ever had. The staff were incredibly friendly and informative. Highly recommend</text>

I had a group of 5 girls and we did the 10:30AM tour.  I thought the tour was good and informative - they gave us 6 different tastings along the tour route.
After the tour ended we sat and had a glass of wine on their porch and enjoyed the view.  I thought the tour was interesting but the facility does not produce any longer so it is more just show barrels and equipment that is not actually used in any production.
Staff was friendly and the tour was a nice change of pace - do wear close toed shoes or no high heels on the tour because you do walk through the vineyards.</review>

Out of all the 16 wineries I have tried in Sonoma I feel like Ravenswood by far has been my least favorite. And I'm not talking about their wines which are actually very good. Only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is for the taste and the views.

When I first arrived No one greeted me or made me feel welcome at all. I finally got the attended of an older gentleman who assisted me in wine tasting.   When I started my first wine, which was delicious, when a couple show up this guy completely forgets about me and is chit chatting away with a couple next to me. He never came back to check on me! And I still had wines left to taste! Eventually after what seemed like forever another girl came to help me.

They seem to really cater to couple but lack in quality when it comes to single regular folk. I would have bought a bottle or even 2 and could consider their wine club but the service was really horrible. There's so many wonderful wineries that make you feel welcome but unfortunately even the delicious wines at Ravenswood do not make up for the terrible service I experienced. Thanks Uncle Joe.< /Text>

<review>We enjoyed the wine thoroughly! Beatiful winery. Staff was cordial but didn't go out of their way to engage our group of four in conversation or make us feel welcome like other places typically do. Still a good experience though. I should note that we're wine club members with Constellation too and they just weren't very friendly here today.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085abfea8a447fd:0x52c3e59ea562e2c5</Gmap_id></record>

<text>The $25 tasting was over as fast as they could do it. 1 ounce, one sentence...next! no discussion,  and nothing to cleanse the palette so everything tasted the same.  A clever way to make you pay $25 for 6 ounces of so-so wine.  And here is the kicker: the casual "would you like to top that of with a little muscato?" Is a cunning $25 upsell.

Excellent customer service. The staff was beyond polite and treated us as friends/family. I did wish the tasting included more than just the Zinfandels but it was interesting to see how different the wine tasted with the same grapes but from different regions. The prices are fantastic and the product is delicious.< /review>

<review>Ravenswood definitely feels smaller than other wineries in the area and has a more commercial feel, but is still a comfortable setting to learn as much as you can about the wines on the tasting menu. I enjoyed their reds over their whites and enjoyed the rustic feel.</review>< time>

This winery is worth the one and a half mile hike from downtown. The staff is friendly, and very generous with their tastings menu. They're very sociable and interesting to talk to with an interesting story of the name of the winery.  Most importantly the wine is excellent.<//text>

I hate to say it, but this place is corny. The wine is...ok. The service is quite poor. It felt borderline unwelcoming. The views are nice but that’s about all. Considering other places we have been that were so pleasent and had great wine, this stop is not worth your time. Also...who wrote those wine descriptions?! 😬<//review>

<Text>Summary: Lots of big, dry, taniny reds. Peter is an awesome pourer (very knowledgeable, generous, and friendly). Cute place, lots of parking, big cottony tree.

I came here on a Friday afternoon with my wife and her parents.  We managed to find some parking in the shade which was nice because it was extremely hot out.  There is a lot of parking in general.  We made our way up the stairs to the tasting room past a really crazy cotton tree thing and were met outside by Peter, who welcomed us inside.  He brought us to the tasting bar and explained the tasting options and asked us what we liked.  He then began pouring.

After each tasting he asked us what we thought and started changing his follow ups based on what we enjoyed.  We went through a good amount of tastings and has some really fun conversation with him about motorcycles, mountain biking, and the value of full face helmets (random sounding to you, probably, but it was fun).  It was a very pleasant tasting and a pretty good value, even if we didn't like all of the wines.<//Text>< Pics>

Nice little spot with patio overlooking vineyards in valley below. Great wines! Helpful staff. Enjoyed a bottle of sauv blanc on the patio and took home a great Zinfandel and cab sauv. They have good product and they are not stuffy.< /Text>

Decent wines, not the best in the valley by any means, but with unfortunately heavy pricing. A tasting is $25 bottles or not, for a narrow selection of ok Zinfandels. Staff was helpful but cold, I wouldn't go again but don't regret the trip out.</text>

Ravenswood Zinfandel has LONG been a staple in our home and one of our go-to wines. We have many great memories with them that we had to make the trek over the Mountains from Yountville to Sonoma. We did make the drive over the mountains between Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley, even though all the locals looked at us like we were insane. (Oakville Grade, to Dry Creek Rd, to Trinity). Don't take that route unless you are completely sober, and experienced driving on twisting 1-lane mountain roads. But it was a beautiful drive, and we saw some of the fire damage that sadly affected parts of the region in 2017. We arrived at Ravenswood after a nice drive out of downtown Sonoma and were blown away with the beautiful location. We were early for the Library Tasting we had scheduled, so we had some time just to wander around the property with a glass of Blanc. Mike was our sommelier and I'll be perfectly honest that at first I wasn't sure we were going to hit it off. However, after a few glasses of wine (for us, not him) he really opened up. In all seriousness he was amazing and after a few minutes he had us hooked with his knowledge of the valley, his stories, and his background which were unparalleled at any vineyard we visited. It was amazing to hear how so many people in Napa/Sonoma got there start by working with Robert Mondavi. Mike "educated" us on what a Library Tasting was. I am embarrassed to say that I thought I scheduled my wife and I for a nice tasting in a Library at the Vineyard. Only to find out that a "Library Tasting" was a tasting of the older aged wines that the Vineyard produced from the bottles they kept for themselves year by year. This mistake was perfect for us though because in Maryland we only get really 1 type of Ravenswood Zinfandel and it is the cheaper mass-produced version. However, the winery has so many other Zinfandels (and other varietals) than we have had before. So, the Library Tasting gave us a wonderful experience in to some of the aged versions of these better wines. Mike actually was very fond of the version we get in MD and said at $10 a bottle is was one of the best budget wines out there, and we agree with him on that. Now, neither of us had the pallet for this very strong, aged Zinfandel, but the experience was great. I don't know how many glasses we consumed in that tasting, but it was a good portion. We left there and purchased a cheese plate, grabbed two glasses of Zin, joined their wine club, and then sat outside in their VIP section overlooking the mountain views. Absolutely stunning. We actually tried 1-2 of their bottles inside which were around $35-40 and they were really good. One of the cheeses we tried on our plate was an aged Monterey Jack cheese from a local shop in Sonoma. We asked where to find it and went there IMMEDIATELY upon leaving to check it out. On our way out we also picked up a nice bottle of Zinfandel 2014 Teldeschi to take with us. The cheese shop was VELLA CHEESE CO and you simply must stop there while leaving Ravenswood. Again, Mike was the highlight of the trip even though the wines and winery were fantastic. Joel and Carolyn, Frederick Maryland</text>

A great place to relax on the Muskoka chairs and enjoy the hilltop view with a glass of wine. Know for their Zinfandels, this winery will not disappoint.  Friendly staff and an easygoing atmosphere. My wife and I make a point of going to Ravenswood whenever we are in town.</Text>

Scheduled a group outing for 17 at Ravenswood, and the service and wine couldn't have been better!  They gave us the back half of the vineyard with picnic tables in the sun and a dedicated server. Doesn't get much better than that!< /Text>

Ravenswood Winery is a beautiful spot nestled in the hillside close to Sonoma. The winemaker believes there is no room for wimpy wines, his wines are bold and delicious! I highly recommend the Lodi Zinfandel.</text>

Love going wine tasting. Ravenswood is off the beaten track hidden away on its own but its worth going for the peace and quiet compared to others. You get more attention from the tasting staff and can strike up some very interesting conversations. The wine? They specialize in Zinfandel and offer Pinot Noir and Moscato too.< /text>

<text>A mecca for Zin lovers, Ravenswood has a much broader range of wine than you may be used to seeing in supermarkets. The tasting is good value, the staff can enlighten you on Zin facts and the wine club is worth considering if you like big reds.< /text><resp>None< /resp><UserId.>102951244563603960635</UserId.><Time>1326827286069<//Time>< user_name>

<rating>5</rating><review>We usually don't frequent wineries owned by big corporations (Constellation) but we were in the area, and we love zin, so it made sense to stop by.  (We usually frequent places like A. Rafanelli, Benovia - small, family affairs)   The tasting room staff was extremely friendly.  The 'gift shop' experience is not right in your face, instead the gift items are along the outside of the tasting room - and they actually sell some fun items, mostly Ravenswood branded, so not the usual cheap, generic junk some wineries sell.  The wines are pretty outstanding.  We ended up joining their wine club (go figure!) since we will have access to the single vineyard wines and not have tons of the mass market stuff coming to our door.  I was pleasantly surprised by our visit and I highly recommend a stop.</review>< pictures>

<Review>Nice quiet tasting room just 5 minutes away from downtown Sonoma. Service was friendly and we got some extra pours off the menu - always nice. They're known for their zins and muscat. I don't have much of a taste for zin so I didn't really like the wine. But the chard and muscat were awesome. Dog friendly.< /Review>< pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>If you love Zins, this is definitely the go to place for Zins.  They have the most powerful but yet balanced Zins.

My wife and I just took a wine blending class at Ravenswood.  The instructor (Peter) is super knowledgeable and taught us how to taste differences in acid, sugar, tannic, and oak flavors.  We each brought home our own blended of Zins !!!  I can't wait to open them at our next special occasions!<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

< review>
FIRST REVIEW EVER.  I wish there was an option for 10 stars.  Here is what happened – our house was in escrow and the buyer’s inspector claimed that there was water in "all of the walls" in the house, which is ridiculous.  Nonetheless, the buyers were ready to walk in light of the inspector’s report.  I began to panic and the next day I somehow came across Abbotts.  I called at 7:00 a.m. and the owner, Jack Martin, answered the call.  Jack was at the house that afternoon and was able to explain exactly where the buyer’s inspector went wrong – and believe me, he was wrong.  While this is too complicated for me to explain, trust that my walls were not full of water, and that there was an inspector's equipment issue.

Jack was kind enough to meet with the buyers and agents at the house and he explained why the inspector believed there was water in the walls, and why the inspector was wrong, (Jack proved this with superior equipment).  The buyers and agents trusted Jack fully, and the deal was back on.  Jack did find some minor issues that needed repair.  He provided a very reasonable estimate for those repairs, the repairs were finished within a few days, and the house closed.  I honestly do not believe my house would have sold to these buyers if not for Jack and Abbotts.  While I have never given a review before, the service and professionalism compelled me to do so in this instance.  I cannot say enough about these guys.  Thank you Jack and Abbotts!<//review>

Jack, Preston and the team at Abbott's were angels on earth when my 2800 sq ft home was completely flooded. I called Abbott's on a Sunday within 90 minutes Jack and crew arrived ready to go to work! Jack scoped out the damage, provided a step by step plan for emergency mitigation through construction and everything in between.  Jack handled every detail, coordinated with the insurance company,  was fully transparent in communication and budgeting and literally took the burden off my shoulders and onto his. Jack and his team followed through on every commitment and finished the job within the expected time frame. Jack and team at Abbott's truly care about their customers and are all angels!!< /text>

<review>I had what I thought was a big mold problem inside and outside of my house.  I searched the BBB.org website and saw that this company had an A+ rating with a 5 star review, so decided to call.  Jack Martin answered the phone and we started to talk about my issue.  He told me to send him some pics of the mold and I did.  He responded that it was not a problem and that he could come over to take a look and then decide what course of action to take.  Jack came over took take a look and told me that I could take care it myself with problem.  Then gave me some good pointers on my gutters.  I mentioned that my wife could smell mold around the house.  He then said, he could take a look with his equipment to see if anything was alarming.  We walked around the house, the bathrooms and garage.  He found the issue of the smell, which was coming from one bathroom.  Jack told me that a plumber or handy man would do the job and everything should be fine.  Jack, for me, went above and beyond and if there’s any issue in the future, I will for sure give him a call. I urge you to call him if you have issues around your house.  He is very personable and professional.  Thank you Jack for your awesome service!!!<//review><Rating>5</Rating>< name>

After an HVAC catastrophe (water was leaking on three levels of our home) Jack and his crew quickly and efficiently came in and managed the clean up and restoration.  Jack was nothing short of professional and  a pleasure to work with.  It is so refreshing having a contractor you can trust and count on to do the job right and in a timely manner.< /text>

<Review>I had an issue with my toilet leaking. A diyer myself decided to start remodeling my bathroom. When I was starting demolition I noticed that my subflooring was rotting around the toilet and the tub. I haven't done this type of project removing and replacing rotted subfloor (I dont know how to proceed) my plumber friend recommended Mr. Jack's company. I got a call from him. I sent pictures of how it was, he was very understanding and knowledgeable about what I'm dealing with unfortunately their company deals with emergency situations like flooding and fires etc. He referred me to another company. But the kindness and compassion that he gave me says a lot about him and the company that he's with. There should be more businesses like this not all about the profit gains and more about compassion and kindness again Mr. Jack thank you.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I love everything about Abbots Fire and Flood San Diego! At a time when everything is caving in, Jack and Preston came through and saved the day for us! They had equipment available and out to the house within hours of our first call, and had expert advice about next steps when insurance refused to pay for damage. highly recommend you use Abbotts when you have the need. Jack and Preston will treat you like family and take care of your issues STAT! 5 stars all the way!<//Review>

I can’t say enough good things about Abbott’s Restoration & Cleaning Services. Jack and Preston are wonderful. Not only will they treat you like family, but they are professional and  thorough. They went the extra mile to put me at ease in my moment of distress. I am very happy with the service I received and would highly recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat!</text>

I love the service and personal touch Jack and his company help us with.  We had some crazy leak and could not figure out where it was coming from.  And we needed someone to clean up, tear out the mess from the leak.  Not only did they do a Phenomenal job, they also helped me figure out where the leak was coming from. They went way above and beyond.< /Text>

Sharing my experience with Abbotts fire & flood San Diego as a great experience regarding responsiveness & quality. We called Jack and told him about the problem we had with the sewer as we really needed a cleanup company promptly as it was a big problem & we wanted it to be fixed ASAP, he showed up the next day & we agreed on everything & the price was reasonable regarding the big problem we had & the high quality service they provided. He came back on the date we agreed on with his son Preston, and they fixed the whole issue in a couple hours, good as new & very professional, I highly recommend their work & I appreciate them coming & working during this hard time when it was really hard to find someone to accept to come & fix the problem. Thanks Jack & Preston, we appreciate your hard work & punctuality.</Text>

<review>Jack and Preston with Abbott’s fire and flood saved the day for me when I had a flood st my house. It wasn’t covered by insurance but I was able to get their expert advice and support at a time that I had no idea what to do. They had fans and a dehumidifier our to our house the same day I initially called, and we had frequent contact with FaceTime to assess the situation and our progress with drying everything up. We are still in the process of fixing things, and I am so happy to know that I can call Jack with any questions and get his expert advice at any time. Abbott’s really treats you like family. I would highly recommend Abbott’s Fore and Flood if you ever find yourself in the unfortunate circumstances of needing their services.< /review><Date>1588696707073< /Date><user_name>Sue Andrew</user_name><GmapID>0x80deabc14c128bfb:0xe0c262a707246e07< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Our late-night fire was caused by a defective Samsung flat-screen TV and resulted in smoke damage throughout the house and major damage to one of our bedrooms.  Smoke, soot, and heavy ash particles were everywhere, including the attic and furnace.

After researching and interviewing several restoration companies, we selected Abbotts Fire and Flood.  The owner, Jack Martin, met with us immediately and guided us through the insurance claim process and educated us on all the health-related matters that needed to be worked through.

We are grateful for Abbott’s prompt response, expertise, professionalism, and ease of communication which made our nightmare situation feel seamless and less stressful.  Their team was a pleasure to work with and you won’t be disappointed if you have a situation where you need a restoration contractor.

Jack, Preston, Karlo I just want to say thank you for everything you guys did and what a beautiful home we now have!< /Text>

Absolutely the best!!  Very  professional and definitely customer service oriented.  Our lives had just been turned upside down by a neighbor’s water leak and we were scrambling trying to figure out what to do.  Jack with Abbott’s responded immediately.  His calm demeanor and excellent customer service skills put us at ease as he explained everything he would be doing and how he was going to do it! He had all the right equipment to get the job done quickly and efficiently.  We are so SO thankful to have had Jack and his crew handle the mess!  He had great recommendations for getting the other clean up and repair aspects done and guided us in putting our home back in order.  Thank you Jack, for being there when we needed you!< /review>

We had flooding cause by the water company in our area, mu husband was uneasy with their repair contractor and we contacted Abbotts,  Jack Martin came to our house and explained the process to get the crawl space dry, he told us what to expect from the water company contractors, also told us what to demand from them, they  are very helpful and even thou we didn’t hire them to do the clean up, he was always available to give us information and guidance, he called on several occasions to check on how we were doing with the other company and kept us informed on what to ask from them.  Even thou we didn’t contract them I wouldn’t think twice to hire them in the future if we need to work on our home.
I appreciate all the help and concern we had with Jack Martin from Abbotts<//review>

Extremely professional.  This is the second time I needed Abbotts fire and flood.  Both times the service was on-time and thorough.  The first event was managed by Jack the father.  Since then Jack has taught his son the business.  Do not let his son's youthful looks deceive you.  His son is fantastic to deal with and his and the team's work should make his father proud< /text>

Our S.D. home failed it’s home inspection days before our closing, the home inspection on behalf on the buyers found a broken main drain beneath the shower on the opposite side of the house from the crawl space opening.  The bathroom drains had been draining directly into our crawl space, flooding half of it for some time. This I thought was going to postponed our move to Scottsdale with the moving truck packed and ready to out front of the house. I called Abbott’s on a Sunday, they were out at my house in less than an hour. We as a family, took to Jack and his son Preston right away. We were quickly disarmed of our anxiety and fears. When someone really knows what they are talking about, You can tell. They called State Farm after hours claims service with my husband, explained what had happened and got a claim number and the OK to start the job. I thought Jack and Preston were going to come back the next day. No, they went out the front and came back in the door with hoses and drying equipment and went to work, Amazing. All worries aside and needless to say, we handed them the keys and left our home one last time before starting the drive to our new home in Scottsdale. I just knew we were in good hands. I want to thank you both, so much for what you guys did for us.</text>

<Text>We had a fire in our house and worked closely with Jack Martin for our restoration needs. He and his team got the job done quickly and thoroughly! Furthermore, Jack was a terrific communicator with us throughout this whole process, and that was really most helpful for us in understanding and appreciating the progress (or challenges) of each step along the way. We could tell that Jack has much experience and skill from which to draw upon, and that was leveraged for us getting back in our home.

Here is the review I promised, and it's long overdue. We had the pleasure of working with Abbotts in April. I called them because, I needed a mold expert to remove the mold, the testing company had found and Abbott's had great reviews on yelp.  I'm so happy I did.  I'm giving you guys high Marks and Five Stars as well. I couldn't be happier with the mold removal / remediation they completed at my home . They were so friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. They kept my house spotless and more importantly they started the job within 2 days of giving us  the bid. Lastly, and most importantly the final air sampling the follow week came back clean. I was happy to write the check. Thank you, you guys are great, I highly recommend.<//Review>< Pics>

I wanted to take this opportunity to tell you how pleased I am to have had the privilege of working with the folks at Abbotts over the past years. There is a level of satisfaction amongst all of us here, everyone is family. I have seen first hand, what it is to be on an elite team of caring professional people. I have been apart of a lot of hard work and high standards that define being part of the Abbotts Fire and Flood Family.  This Team... My Team, has made a difference in hundreds of happy customers and that makes me proud to be part of this.</text>

<review>I rarely write reviews, but Barry and his crew showed up earlier than expected which was a pleasant change from many companies I've used in the past. I personally manage over 125 residential apartments. It was a saving grace to have a company like Abbott's Fire and Flood to call in an emergency, which is stressful especially when after hours. I appreciate both the quick response and quality of work they provide. They are truly second to none.<//review>< resp>

Jack, is an honest, straight shooter, knowledgeable, He knows his industry, he’s beyond passionate and he doesn't mind sharing what he knows, based on his experience and industry standards. We had three quotes, we chose Abbott’s, they quoted us a fair price on a  large fire at our home, they itemized everything in the estimate. They walked us through our site with our claims person and explained each cost, This gave us a complete understanding of each line item. Before they started and after we chose them, our insurance company said they sometimes recommend them, which was reassuring. The job is done and we are back in our home. Thanks, Team Abbotts</text>

Choose Abbot's because they're the kind of folks that will show up, do professional work for a reasonable price and be 100% transparent through the entire process. In one word, integrity. No games, no bait and switch, just honest work. Abbott's is the kind of business your grandfather would choose.<//text>< date>

I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with Jack Martin for a few years now and it has been a very rewarding relationship. Jack Martin is man of great character and if, god forbid, we were to experience a disaster, Jack at Abbotts Fire and Flood would be my first and only call, not only because of their extreme professionalism and expertise but because I know I can trust them, and that's a hard thing to find.</Text>

Jack and his team saved me and my client when we found out their property had mold. I needed someone to come out and take care of it immediately. Jack was able to get his crew out there and solve the problem within a few days.  He was efficient and we were able to get through escrow without any delays.  Thank you so much for your quick response and great service.  I will definitely use Abbotts again in the future!< /review>

<text>I am a real estate agent.  I’ve seen A LOT of houses.  I recently had a home in escrow that presented obvious signs moisture in the walls.  The source of the damage had stumped the general inspector as well as two other Restoration companies.  When I called Abbots I was feeling a little defeated.  Jack answered and he was awesome!  He was able to get out to the home quickly.  Not only was was INCREDIBLY knowledgeable, he brought in equipment that no other company had.  Jack was able to solve our mystery!  From here on out, Abbots will be my first phone call for any home I come across in need of Restoration/Remediation services!< /text>< Pictures>

I actively and highly recommend Abbotts Fire and Flood for your emergency needs.  I have used Abbotts for multiple issues (mold, flooding, odor issues)  as I am in property management.  Not only do I trust them to understand the problem fully from diagnosis to remediation but it is a pleasure working with Jack and his crew always.  They have all of the right knowledge and information to help me understand the scope of the issue and the best resolution and I just know I am always in the right hands.  Thank you Jack for having my back and my clients,.<//review>

Moving all my furniture around because of the flood wasn't easy, they spent a lot of extra time, taking care of my concerns, while vacuuming up all the water in my house. These guys are professional and do a great job for your company. Their attention to detail, expertise, and professionalism shows, everything went unbelievably great.

Best decision we ever made. Would recommend Abbotts Fire & Flood Restoration Company in San Diego, CA  to everyone over and over again!!!  Thank you for all your hard work and professionalism. We have 3 small children and when our basement backed up we were freaked out. Made and call and they came out in 1 hours and worked day and night. They took this very serious and made us feel safe knowing they knew exactly what they were doing THE RIGHT WAY !  Job well done. Better than expected.

Great company! Abbotts Fire and Flood Restoration is a very professional and knowledgeable company.  After a small house fire that left my home smelling of smoke.

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Last week we called Abbotts to cleanup a large amount of laundry detergent that spilled all over our mud room floor and carpet.  The concentrated detergent bounced off the top of our washing machine due to an oversize load from my 9 year old. Talk about a mess, it was terrible!  The more water we added, the worse the slippery "sudsy" problem became.  It was a cleanup nightmare!!!!

Abbotts came out immediately and applied a dry powdery material that soaked up all of the concentrated liquid laundry detergent.  Then Abbotts used a huge suction machine to make it all go away.  I was very impressed because they made a nightmare look easy to clean up.

I would highly recommend them to anyone. If you have a disaster call Abbotts. they were very professional, fast, and thorough.<//Review><rate>4</rate>< Time>

I wanted to thank Abbotts for helping come to my rescue. My house was flooded the other night with water damage. I called other restoration companies in San Diego, but not a one answered the phone at 2am. When I called Abbott's. They were at my house within an hour and worked through the night, moving furniture and pulling carpet to get the water out of my house and start drying. I was impressed by their efforts. They moisture checked my house daily, moved equipment to make sure that my house was dry. Thank you for all your hard work! ( Preston, Pete, Barry and Jack)< /Review>

Jack and his team have been great to work with.  I would recommend him for restoration work without hesitation.  They obviously have the equipment and the skills to clean and restore properties, but they add a personal touch in their communication with their clients, consultants, and the other parties.< /Review>

<Review>Abbott's wasn't my first call. They were the first to pick up the phone at 10pm on a Sunday though. They just did a fantastic job, these guys were at my home in 45 minutes, when everyone else said they would schedule me for the morning. I can't stress enough how much I appreciated that when my house was soaking wet. They sucked up all the water, pulled the carpet and pad and left me with lots of equipment.  Just nice guys. father and son.
I highly recommend them.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

The abbott's team came to our house to a huge mess after a sewage back-up and to pack out our home.  The basement was full of stuff and to anyone this job would have been overwhelming.  You took charge and showed exceptional leadership skills, communicated well with us and exhibited a strong work ethic.  As you can see, we are very impressed with the job you did.<//Review>

While I never wish catastrophe on anyone, if you live in San Diego and need professional help with your flood, fire or really anything that happens in your home or office in a construction form that gives you angst, you will find solace in Abbott's by your side. They have replicated their abilities in the San Diego area and you will not be disappointed.  I'm a former (demanding) customer.</review>

My daughter and I both heard water pouring through the ceiling in our showers. Someone 2 floors above had been smoking and the fire sprinklers were triggered, causing the floors below to become flooded. The fire department was already on their way, but thankfully Jack Martin of Abbott's Fire and Restoration lived in our building. As soon as Jack saw me he came running up the stairs to our apartment and dismantled the shower head and diminished the destruction. Although there was damage to the carpet, because of Jack's immediate response, the situation wasn't nearly as bad a sit could have been! Thank you Jack Martin!<//Text>< Pics>

Jack, the owner of Abbotts fire and flood was so incredibly helpful  when my neighboring townhouse had excessive mold that was creeping into my home and making me physically ill.   He provided immediate necessary air filtration along with other precautions.  Jack  did everything possible to keep me and my unit safe throughout... Even though the neighbors mitigation efforts were below par. Most importantly, Jack checked in with me regularly making sure i was OK.    He went above and beyond. Thanks Jack!< /Text>

As a manager of South Florida luxury condominium towers, I have experienced a range of storm and flood disasters over the past ten years.  The most recent was the worst,  but mitigation by Abbott’s led by Jack Martin was absolutely the best.  Top notch equipment, technicians, strategy, and follow through. There were continuing weather incidents causing re-wetting. Jack and team monitored constantly and were back on site at all hours of day and night with impeccable response, discipline and documentation so essential to a complex event and insurance claim.  We never called for extra service, they came, did what needed to be done and met us with timely reports.
For all of that, what really puts Jack and his team over the top is their respect, compassion and care for all the people affected. They themselves were working 12 plus hours a day, double bunked for weeks miles from home, but always had smiles, empathy and a helping hand going the extra mile before we could ask.
Bravo and a million thanks to Jack and the Abbott’s family team.  — M. Niemeier, LCAM<//text>

A month or so later, we started to feel the negative health effects of living with mold. We decided to research and hire our own unbiased team to test, sample the crawl and air in our home, only to find out, our home was unfit for human habitation.
Faced with live colonies of visible mold in the crawlspace and spores throughout our living areas. we hired Rarefied Air Environmental, who then referred us to the team at Abbott's. The guys at Abbott's did a great job working with Rarefied, providing containment of each area, until clean sampling came back clean from the lab. The idea of taking one room on at a time. Sampling, cleaning, sampling again until passing air sampling, reassured me that each area was free of mold. The very last day, the guys pulled the containments down in each clean and sampled area, like a giant gift of health for us. I want to sincerely thank, Rarefied Environmental & Abbott's Fire and Flood.< /Text><date>1465943285277<//date>< pics>

Thank you Yelp, for Abbotts Fire and Flood San Diego.

I had an emergency situation at my cafe in South Park at 5 pm on a Friday evening.  I had a major flood in the crawl space under my cafe from a broken pipe, leaving hundreds of gallons of sitting gray water.  After calling several flood and disaster specialists and getting the runaround, from other companies answering services and no returned call backs.  I luckily found locally owned and operated Abbotts.  After a few rings, a gentleman (the owner) answered and took a brief assessment of the situation. He promised to arrive in 45 mins and to my surprise he did. Abbott’s is operated by a father and son team.

They completed the job of removing the flood water and made sure that the surrounding area was clean and disinfected of any dirty gray water. Not only did they do a great job, but they were very courteous in having the professionalism of dealing with the surrounding tenants, who were concerned about the water residue.  This company went above and beyond to satisfy. To Preston and Jack. Thank you for taking care of me and my business, I don’t know what I would have done had, you both not come to my rescue. I fed them both afterward, and now they are regulars at my cafe.    They are the very best at what they do!!

My three-story townhouse flooded due to a faulty sprinkler head.  I had about a 1000 gallons of water go through 3 floors.  It was a disaster!  I called Abott's fire and flood after the fire department shut off the sprinkler system. They were there in less than an hour starting clean up and drying out my place.   Calling Abbott's made the difference a difficult and stressful situation.  They were professional efficient and knowledgeable.  I will keep their number on speed dial i just hope i don't have to use it!<//text>

In our dealings with Abbott's we have been amazed by their Professionalism and Attention to detail that is second to none in the Restoration Industry.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80deabc14c128bfb:0xe0c262a707246e07</GmapID></record>

Using Abbotts was a truly professional experience and got us back to normal as quick and comfortable possible given our disaster. Even the CEO, Jack Martin was on the job immediately and his team were super attentive to our situation. You cannot go wrong using Abbotts in the unofortunate event you have a fire, flood, natural disaster, etc.<//review>

<name>Cory Lane<//name><text>Had a huge water pipe burst from faulty plumbing while we were away for the weekend.  We came home to 8 inches of standing water in our basement that started in our new master bath and quickly spread through the house.  Our first call was to our insurance agent who suggested we call Abbott's. Within 45 minutes they had a team at our house and after a quick walk through and some paperwork to fill out, they got started.  My wife and I moved to a hotel and abbott's worked through the week to get our house dry and back to new.  A good amount of our belonging had to be inventoried and photographed, because they were ruined, fortunatley Abbotts was able to save and dry out a lot of family photos and other personal things in place.  We were very impressed with the work they did.  The professionalism of the employees and how well they worked with the insurance adjuster. You wouldn't be able to know we had a flood in our house, highly recommended.</text></record>

This is the first time I have ever written a review.  I live in Colorado and had an ugly sewage and plumbing disaster strike my rental property in California.  Jack of Abbotts F & F SD worked extremely well with not only me, from afar, but with my property manager and insurance adjustor as well!  My tenants were also very pleased with the quick results.  Jack also went out of his way to provide us with a reliable electrican and roofer.  I hope something like this doesn't happen to me again, but if it does, I now know who to call.  I highly recommend!<//Text>

<Review>We discovered lots of water coming from what seemed everywhere upon arriving home, a broken supply line to the toilet in our upper bathroom was the culprit. Water coming through the ceilings. Jack and his son came over and took complete control of the whole situation, these guys were quite amazing. Extracting water, moving furniture, cleaning up, installing equipment and drying out the my wet house. What a mess and what a job they had to deal with. I want to personally thank you both for your kindness and professionalism. I would highly recommend.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1515646839538, 'text': 'Thanks for your wonderful review, David.'}< /Response><GmapID>0x80deabc14c128bfb:0xe0c262a707246e07< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I just wanted to take a minute to thank all of you for your hard work. The fire sprinkler loss we suffered, well our offices were completely flooded and everything was just soaked and I was worried that we would be out of business for the foreseen future. Five plus days with your fans and heavy duty drying machines and normalcy is imminent . I want to thank Abbott's, I wanted to let you know I am very pleased and thankful for their assistance in working with the adjuster and the quality of professionalism of the your men who came in and fixed our problems. The flooded offices are just as they were before, ready for some small repairs. I appreciate not having to oversee the process. I will definitely recommend your services.
I am also directing a copy of this letter to Chubb and my agent who has had my coverage for the past 10 years to thank everyone at Chubb for their support in a time of crisis. Again, thanks<//Text>

<review>Our home flooded in San Diego while we were on vacation.  When we walked in there was mold everywhere and the house smelled awful.  IOne of the pipes had broken which we did not notice because we were gone.  We called two different companies including Abbotts Fire and Flood and they were able to come clean up early the next day.  They accepted our insurance which was great. They removed all the water and began drying the house with big fans that circulated air to dry everything out.  The fans were there for several days and when they were finished all the mold was gone and we could start installing our flooring. The entire staff was great including the owner Jack who was very helpful during a stressful time.  I would use them again if I ever need their service.</review>< pictures>

<name>Lisa Denton</name>< review>
Bit**'s! Not to sharp there....I asked for location of 501's and this young lady walks me to a rack of shredded&paper thin 505's....????? I said, "Oh ya, that's 501s eh?" She replied "Yes they are." I laughed and said you really were born yesterday, huh?" You should know the products of the most popular jean company, world wide. You are so fired! She nervously giggled....I found a cool pair of super skinny Levi's in my size on clearance rack for $20, so I went to cash register and there was my newborn......Long story long, she did not count back my change of a $100.00 bill.....I was so floored by her ability to remain employed with such a minimal work ethic. I will never shop there again.<//review>

Good deals in the clearance section.  Pants as low for 5 bucks.  Highly recommend to check monthly.  And they offer additional discounts<//text>

My kids hated it but I loved it I bought at least 1 item from the stores that I went to.  There are so many stores like adidas, nike,etc. I would highly recomend these outlets if  you are looking for something specific or just looking around.</text>

I'm a size too, but because I'm over 40 when I ask the young lady for skinny jeans, she took me to the control top section. Thanks. Nothing like being age and weight shamed by somebody younger and heavier than I.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) When you pay they ask you all right. It is very important this attention from the cashiers (OS)

<Text>(Translated by Google) Probably by the date we went (12/31) the store was quite outdated with the products. The prices, even with the discounts, were not as wonderful as they were in previous years. I don't think we got it right on the date.

(Original)
Provavelmente pela data que fomos (12/31) a loja estava bastante defasada em relação aos produtos. Já os preços, mesmo com os descontos,  não estavam maravilhosos como já foram em anos anteriores.

Amber helped me out, she was really cool. The clinic looks way better now than before. She helped me pick the right choice of bud. She also offered me a dab and top shelf pre roll. She was very helpful.</Text>

Used to come to the church before, not gonna lie they were starting to disappoint me after a while with lack of quality, but me oh my the reef and their flower quality is incredible! Not just their quality but their customer service is off the CHARTS! Seriously, the girls here were super polite and willing to help and teach. Thank you Olive!<//review>

This is becoming one of my favorite dispensary to come to, I get top notch service from the moment I walk in, I try to come in during their happy hours or daily deal but its hard not to come in just for some great service and great conversation, I literally never feel rushed or pressed in here and thats why I enjoy coming in here. I want to thank olive and all the ladies for continuing to be wonderful, they are honestly delightful.<//Text>

<Text>Heard of this new dispensary down off Newport Blvd! I had to go check it out myself! Turns out, its a great cannabis store front with high quality flower. They are stocked on product like vapes, edibles and even wax! They even have some of my fav brands like dime and plug & plays. I was surprised they even had edible drinks! they have stndrds, which are the bomb. What was really cool is the nice parking lot with plenty of parking space! I felt very welcomed when i went in and the girls were super nice and very attentive with helping me. I will definitely be coming back here ! I think it's gonna be my new favorite store!< /Text>< Pictures>

I just wanted to say thank you ! First time at this cannabis dispensary! All I can say top quality cannabis products ! This is probably the best cannabis shop in Costa Mesa ! It is worth the drive coming from Irvine. They have all the popular products like Stiiizy , Plug n Play and Dime ! They have a wide variety of cannabis flower like Skywalker OG and King Louie Og ! I also bought some Cbd for muscle soreness and also bought my dog some cbd dog treats! They also have a great rating on weedmaps, so if your looking for a dispensary near Costa Mesa come see this shop ! And the customer service is amazing ! See you soon !< /text>

Messed up my order, but made it right! This was the first time this location had messed up a order of mine, being that they said it was delivered, when no pizza driver ever showed up. After calling the store, they said they would send another order. I assumed they would lag it on the order, but it came within 20 min and they even hooked it up with a cookie dessert and drinks. Thanks for being #1 Papa.</Text>

<review>Pizza was not appealing and appeared to be rushed through. The pizza had one topping all in one spot of the pizza and not enough of another topping. Also, the restaurant had given my order to a different customer! Very disappointed in this food, expectations not met, paid a lot of money to receive poor quality of pizza.</review>< Gmap_id>

last night was the first time in this good restaurant. But It is absolutely not the last. We enjoyed the evening a lot with the efficient service, with the magnificent  meal and booze and with the friendly pay. We will definitely go back there again.<//Review>

< Review>
I just ordered from this location papa johns through doordash and it was a simple large pepperoni pizza and it was by far the worse pizza I’ve ever had. The cheese was very under cooked and the pizza was extremely oily. I couldn’t even pick up the pizza without it falling apart. Will never order from here again. If I could give negative stars I would.</Review>

<review>The owners are very nice and in fact all employees were quick with help and a smile.  Very clean establishment and the customer can see the whole operation and store from the front.  Excellent pizza, just as ordered, friendly people made the visit that much nicer.  Thanks!  Mike in Whittier.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><date>1562453127061<//date>< Resp>

I think it'll depend on the kind of pizza toppings you get, there are definitely flavorful options but overall it's fairly average. It's not like the dough is phenomenal or anything like that. It's acceptable.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2d355d6e86a53:0xe56c79d0d78cd3b0<//gmapID>< UserId.>

Fast, Fresh, Flavorful Food. I Love to order in store vs. over the phone or web because they make the pizza one by one right in front of you. Dough, Sauce, Toppings, to oven you see it all. They always quality check your food at the counter to make sure everything is perfect just the way you like. Definitely top of my list for pizza joints.</Text>

The pizza tastes like pizza. no complaint here, but the guy answered the phone, Completely mumbled, couldn't make out his name. and they send a woman who speaks broken english. the "gentleman" who answered the phone was also completely short with his speech. He wasn't  rude, but wasn't friendly. I called a papa johns that was farther away from my house and they helped me out.

i myself work for a chain of restaurants and this is a poor example of customer service.< /review>

<review>Eileen was very patient over the phone while she searched for my address since the Whittier location was closed. 99% of the time I do not drink soda, but today I decided to treat myself. I asked for whichever one they carried coke/Pepsi. And she kindly said they have Pepsi but offer a variety of other refreshments. Now my soda day is consisting of apple soda which is making my mouth water with the fact that my pizza will arrive in 30 minutes. Mmmm

Thank you Eileen. Pizza Hut charges $21 for medium pizzas, I saved money too!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d355d6e86a53:0xe56c79d0d78cd3b0< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>The pizza is always as expected from Papas. For our Super Bowl™ Party one of the 5 pizzas was not right, I called and they said we could go pick up a replacement or get one another time... I understand their problem with everyone getting pizza for the Super Bowl™ and we were not about to leave the party to go pick up a pizza. So they gave us a credit for a future pizza.

Frequently they do not bring the free garlic dipping sauce. I have taken to just ordering it for the $.59 or whatever, then subtracting that from the tip. You guys really piss me off when you do that. Of course, when I do order dipping sauce you always include the free one, so I have 2. Gee Thanks.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp><user_name>Brian Bergström</user_name>< Rate>

My pizza arrived promptly, however it appears as though my driver decided to go offroading on his way here. The pizza was all messed up, with the underside of some slices visible somehow. No way presentable. To top it all off (pun intended) I specifically ordered jalapenos to be added to my pizza, which were completely absent. Never ordering from here again.<//Text>

Their original crust, breadsticks and garlic sauce are all vegan!! However, loading the pizza with all available vegetables will make your pizza EXPENSIVE AF so be prepared to spend more than 40 bucks :S<//Review>

The beet poke is the real deal!! I'll order that every time I go there.
Neat ball Masala was very tasty. Meatballs were juicy. And the plate itself was really filling.
Green Forest pizza was dank. The mozzarella was rich and creamy.</Text>< Gmap_id>

I find some comments true some and some not. Nice girls are available depends on the day and time you go in. They dont have drinks inside but that doesnt mean i couldnt drink mine before going in. Anyway not a bad club around here. Will go there again and again.< /text>

<review>The cashiers are nice, and the car wash crew does a decent job, but one of the car detailers is very rude. The short guy has an attitude and that’s a problem because the customer is always correct. The other day I paid $20 for a detail and they left the back bumper of my truck dirty. And the short guy left to go take a break before they even finished cleaning my truck. Honestly that guy needs to get fired because the other 2 guys do a great job, and he’s ruining their image. He’s basically dead weight.< /review>< Pics>

Even though there is a bit of a smell inside of the mechanical car wash and the workers don’t speak fluent English I was impressed with the deluxe package for $28 including vacuuming and a hand wax.
I’ll definitely be back!<//Text>

I’m not normally the type to make a review—the only times I do are when the service is astounding or abysmal. Unfortunately, this is the latter. I cannot stress how rude and disrespectful the clerk was. If it wasn’t for the elderly man before me, I would have brushed this review/experience away and ended it at that.

I will definitely be sending my business to the Chevron next door. Rather, it was so abysmal that this experience has deterred me from ever giving my business to Shell ever again.<//review>

Worst possible cashier and manager. Unhelpful. Tried the service and xpress car wash. All the dirt and stains were still there. No makeup for the disservice, rudeness and unhelpful.< /Text>

The older guy with the beard and the Hispanic guy with the sunglasses have really bad attitudes. And this is not just once but consistently bad. Obviously they don't know where their paychecks really come from.</text>

Extremely unprofessional and rude staff. The car wash is a complete ripoff. The cleaner don’t speak English, you can’t ask them anything.</text>

<text>I've been coming to this location for about 10 yrs, (maybe even longer). Hugo & Mari are a great team. They are very professional,  they both have great customer service & above all are truly friendly. Whether u need a payday loan, money order, pay a bill or simply wire money, they make it quick & easy. Don't get me wrong sometimes it gets busy & there is a line outside (due to this pandemic) but honestly, I don't mind the wait, cause their service is great! Keep up the awesome work that u both do, we appreciate u!...</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1601360231638, 'text': 'At ACE, we work hard to make things easy for our consumers, and we’re happy to hear that you were pleased with our service.

This is the closest location to me and my favorite spot to go to. Hugo and Maria are always helpful and very informative when it comes to my account. They were actually the ones who helped me obtain a flare account. I also love that they helped me with the direct deposit and I get paid a day early now. Good job guys !</Review>

(Translated by Google) I like the good service that the people who work in that store give, Hugo and Mrs. María, every time I go to cash my check they are very efficient and serve well the customers that I see before me. They welcome you with great professionalism and the most important thing they speak my Spanish language. Just that money orders are very expensive. 🤔

Me gusta el buen servicio que dan las personas que trabajan en esa tienda, Hugo y la Sra.

Terrible school please do not enroll I know of multiple people who have been scammed please beware they will over charge you for equipment they should be providing and if you decide to drop out and file for a refund the owner will not give it to you they will hang up on you and be super disrespectful.

Two of my kids went to the school and did great.  I was very pleased with the culture of the school and the way they motivated and encouraged the students to succeed.  I was not able to get financial aid and the school was willing to work with me on a payment schedule for their tuition.  I am happy and they both are happy with this fine school.</review>

<review>Short wait. Long time sitting in chair. As I'm .typing this review my kid is dozing off in the chair getting a simple haircut. I understand the young man cutting hair is learning, but after a half hour is still using the hair clippers to trim the sides.
Not good.
I also wonder if all the five star ratings mentioning specific names are actual people of Frederico posting them.<//review>< pics>

<Text>I called the school recently asking about the new Make up course. I spoke with a young woman on the phone. She told me that she couldn't go over the schedule over the phone same with price. She invited me in to discuss the program and get my questions answered. I accepted the invite.

When I went in  she went over the entire programs requirements and what it takes to complete the class and get my license. We then went over scheduling. I'm super glad we didn't do it over the phone, it wouldn't have made sense. She laid out a schedule that she customized to work around my home and work schedules. When we got to the cost portion I found that it was very low. I've looked at a lot of schools and found them to be a lot more expensive. Add to it that they can help me even though I don't have a diploma and I'm totally sold.

I can't wait to get started in class and get into my new career. Thanks Federico College.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I've been going there for years, but they've gotten pretty lax and uncaring.  Trying to get through to them and they've been open for a while but no one answers the phone and their voicemail is full.  Seems they don't really care about business.<//Review>

<review>Teachers do not really teach . More of a self teaching program. No structure whatsoever. Also the school took part of my refund  for taking sick days with out a doctors note, even tho a ongoing medical letter was on file for a chronic disease i was battling  Switched to Milan and it has been a huge difference, there is actually structure in the class. It is not a free for all self teaching class like Federicos. Dont waste your money or time !Go to Milan the offer financial aid there as well.<//review>< pictures>

As a licensed professional, I have seen many beauty schools fail and go out of business, over the years. The Federico family has been in the industry for over 72 years! They must be doing something right.  For every success story, there are always going to be haters, saying negative things, yet this school remains trusted and enrollment is at its highest!  When is the last time that you went onto a business website and left a positive review? People tend to only want to leave reviews when they have had a negative experience, leaving the positive experiences to go under shadowed.
Having worked in multiple educational settings, I must say that this school offers the BEST State Board testing Prep! If you are searching for a trusted college to pursue your Barber/Cosmo career, Federico College is the best in the Beauty industry. They have been in business since 1946, that is over 72 years! Wether you are experienced or barely starting in the beauty career industry, Federico College will meet your needs and give you the training to pass the State Board and Licensing requirements. They have the most flexible schedules and can accommodate almost any work schedule. The instructors have a combined experience that far surpasses any other career colleges. Go into the school in person, and see for yourself. Don’t always believe what you read, there will always be critics that never have anything positive to say. If you are serious about a career in the industry, do your research, check it out for yourself, and maybe even get a $5 haircut and talk to a current student about their experience.
Do not always judge a book by its cover, I know that this sounds cliché, but it is true. The campus building has been around since the 80’s, and is currently undergoing new renovations, to accommodate the growing demands of student enrollment.<//text>

I have called for several days trying to make a facial appointment.  The mailbox is full and the one time someone answered I was transferred and my call dropped.  Either super busy or poor business practices. I've come to your college for years...I hate to loose the opportunity to come back.</Review>

I took the manicuring course and our kit was definitely not worth $200 like it states. we didn’t have a day instructor so I payed $100 to switch to the afternoon shift. The school only has one instructor who seems like she’s actually there for the students. She’ll sit there and explain to you and help you. If I didn’t keep track of my operations by taking pictures of my ops sheets before turning them in I probably would still be there and paying $15 per every hour I need because the lady in charge of doing that didn’t count right and said I was missing a lot of ops and hours. She also sent in the wrong paper and I didn’t know until the day of my stateboard, which delayed the board from giving me my results. And there’s a lot more negatives about this school. Only positive thing would be that they can work with your schedule but it has to be done during enrollment. If you know what you’re doing and aren’t new to nails or whatever your going for then I guess you could go here but no I don’t recommend.</Text>

Shady business practices, the owner is dishonest, the career counselor is rude, and why do you need my SSN when I'm just there for an interview? You guys have no idea what marketing is.</Text>

I went here back in the 90s and we didn't have a teacher in the freshman class we also never got our kits.. But we still had to pay for our kits even though we never got them. When I contacted the school about it they said we have them and idk why you never got it.. Well if you had them why didn't you pass them out to us? And why did you make us pay for something we never got! HORRIBLE!!< /Text>

If you're planning to sign up DONT!!!  I signed up and decided to dropout and they do not want to refund at all!!!! I have to constantly call them everyday.way pass the 45 days..hard to get a hold of someone..when I finally got a hold of someone..got my refund after many phone calls...they stole $250 from me!! They're saying thats application and processing fees, but even on the paper says if you haven't start class or receive equipments you will get full refund...they're just money hungry people...so easy to take money but when refunding don't wanna give it back...ridiculous!< /Text>

Terrible school please do not enroll I know of multiple people who have been scammed please beware they will over charge you for equipment they should be providing and if you decide to drop out and file for a refund the owner will not give it to you they will hang up on you and be super disrespectful. This place should be shut down .< /review>

Two of my kids went to the school and did great.  I was very pleased with the culture of the school and the way they motivated and encouraged the students to succeed.  I was not able to get financial aid and the school was willing to work with me on a payment schedule for their tuition.  I am happy and they both are happy with this fine school.< /Review>

The students are friendly and are passionate about their paths, making their services excellent! I especially like receiving services from the spa side. The students are super sweet, with a super sweet instructor, Marcella. Marcella engages the students with hands on learning, and makes the esthetics program super fun! Check out this school, great services!< /Review>

Short wait. Long time sitting in chair. As I'm .typing this review my kid is dozing off in the chair getting a simple haircut. I understand the young man cutting hair is learning, but after a half hour is still using the hair clippers to trim the sides.
Not good.
I also wonder if all the five star ratings mentioning specific names are actual people of Frederico posting them.< /text>

<review>I called the school recently asking about the new Make up course. I spoke with a young woman on the phone. She told me that she couldn't go over the schedule over the phone same with price. She invited me in to discuss the program and get my questions answered. I accepted the invite.

When I went in  she went over the entire programs requirements and what it takes to complete the class and get my license. We then went over scheduling. I'm super glad we didn't do it over the phone, it wouldn't have made sense. She laid out a schedule that she customized to work around my home and work schedules. When we got to the cost portion I found that it was very low. I've looked at a lot of schools and found them to be a lot more expensive. Add to it that they can help me even though I don't have a diploma and I'm totally sold.

I can't wait to get started in class and get into my new career. Thanks Federico College.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I've been going there for years, but they've gotten pretty lax and uncaring.  Trying to get through to them and they've been open for a while but no one answers the phone and their voicemail is full.  Seems they don't really care about business.</review>

<Review>Teachers do not really teach . More of a self teaching program. No structure whatsoever. Also the school took part of my refund  for taking sick days with out a doctors note, even tho a ongoing medical letter was on file for a chronic disease i was battling  Switched to Milan and it has been a huge difference, there is actually structure in the class. It is not a free for all self teaching class like Federicos. Dont waste your money or time !Go to Milan the offer financial aid there as well.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>As a licensed professional, I have seen many beauty schools fail and go out of business, over the years. The Federico family has been in the industry for over 72 years! They must be doing something right.  For every success story, there are always going to be haters, saying negative things, yet this school remains trusted and enrollment is at its highest!  When is the last time that you went onto a business website and left a positive review? People tend to only want to leave reviews when they have had a negative experience, leaving the positive experiences to go under shadowed.
Having worked in multiple educational settings, I must say that this school offers the BEST State Board testing Prep! If you are searching for a trusted college to pursue your Barber/Cosmo career, Federico College is the best in the Beauty industry. They have been in business since 1946, that is over 72 years! Wether you are experienced or barely starting in the beauty career industry, Federico College will meet your needs and give you the training to pass the State Board and Licensing requirements. They have the most flexible schedules and can accommodate almost any work schedule. The instructors have a combined experience that far surpasses any other career colleges. Go into the school in person, and see for yourself. Don’t always believe what you read, there will always be critics that never have anything positive to say. If you are serious about a career in the industry, do your research, check it out for yourself, and maybe even get a $5 haircut and talk to a current student about their experience.
Do not always judge a book by its cover, I know that this sounds cliché, but it is true. The campus building has been around since the 80’s, and is currently undergoing new renovations, to accommodate the growing demands of student enrollment.< /Review>< pictures>

<response>None</response><text>I took the manicuring course and our kit was definitely not worth $200 like it states. we didn’t have a day instructor so I payed $100 to switch to the afternoon shift. The school only has one instructor who seems like she’s actually there for the students. She’ll sit there and explain to you and help you. If I didn’t keep track of my operations by taking pictures of my ops sheets before turning them in I probably would still be there and paying $15 per every hour I need because the lady in charge of doing that didn’t count right and said I was missing a lot of ops and hours. She also sent in the wrong paper and I didn’t know until the day of my stateboard, which delayed the board from giving me my results. And there’s a lot more negatives about this school. Only positive thing would be that they can work with your schedule but it has to be done during enrollment. If you know what you’re doing and aren’t new to nails or whatever your going for then I guess you could go here but no I don’t recommend.<//text><Gmap_id>0x809467f61300f58f:0xb423682bc77f8bcb</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I went here back in the 90s and we didn't have a teacher in the freshman class we also never got our kits.. But we still had to pay for our kits even though we never got them. When I contacted the school about it they said we have them and idk why you never got it.. Well if you had them why didn't you pass them out to us? And why did you make us pay for something we never got! HORRIBLE!!<//Review><Response>None<//Response>< rate>

< Review>
I wanted to try a new place to eat Soul Food, so I came here with the expectations that this was an M and M affiliate. Soul food is cooked from the soul with care and compassion for those whom you are serving. I ordered the smothered chicken, blackeyed peas, potato salad and greens. Unfortunately I was served fried chicken with some brown gravy covering it, the blackeyed peas resembled some brown candied yams and the greens tasted unfamiliar to me. I changed my order to the smothered turkey wings. I got a partial fried turkey wing with some tan gravy covering it, at this point I was done. I paid for my meal and left. It was a disappointing adventure, but the indicator was the lack of customers. I drove to Dulans and waited in that long line for some Soul Food. Sorry this is not the place.< /Review>

<text>The food was really good. You can tell they cook it fresh and homestyle. The waitress was really nice as well as the greeter. We ordered the catfish plate with collard greens and mac and cheese and the short ribs and collard greens.  Both meals came with warm sweet cornbread and boy was it good.The fish was well seasoned and the mac and cheese was delicious and we typically dont like restaurants mac and cheese. Also we had candied yams which were also delicious and not from the can. The short ribs fell off the bone and was also well seasoned. The collard greens were very good as well. The only thing I didnt like was I was not able to tip the waiter with my bill. They had a sign at the cash register that it was cash only to tip the waiter but they didnt have an atm and honestly who keeps cash on hand nowadays days. Overall great experience and great food. Will definitely go back again but will make sure I have some cash to tip the waiter.< /text>< Pics>

The smothered chicken was this hard fried chicken with the worst gravy ever!  The sides of greens, yams and macaroni and cheese were just ok.  The corn bread muffins didn't even taste right!  I feel like this place changed hands and are running under the M&M banner.  Not the quality I'm accustomed to from them.  Will not return.</Review>

The food is good... But recently a waiter there (bearded fellow) completely messed up my order. I drove a LONGGGGGGGG way to eat their food, only to have a waiter not listen to me while ordering. His customer service was TERRIBLE. He offered no resolution to correct the situation. He ruined the appetite I had for the food I drove a LONGGGGGGGG way to get.< /review>

Honestly not to bad. I ordered the fried redsnapper (i don't think it was fried fresh to order may have been been out for a while,) but the flavor was good( just be sure to have your hot sauce and tartar sauce near.) The  Greens was good i like that they give you room to season it to your liking, Same with the Mac and cheese. I also ordered the potatoe salad which was neutral. Overall pretty good if you just want something diffrent to eat while you're out and have a craving for soul food. I would probably visit again in the furture.</Review>

There are so many things I want to say about MS. B and M&M's staff. The food was amazing and the staff feel like family. My mother, daughter and I ordered and ate, then we had issues with my car. MS. B stayed with us well after closing until our help finally arrived. She's such a beautiful person and a blessing in her own right. Her caring for others goes far beyond a transaction of money.  I'm going back for the wings, peach cobbler and a big hug.
Thank You Ms. B 💙 the lady with a💛 of Gold.....</review>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>A little disappointed with the manager not honoring the discount program their place of business participated. I read all the rules and restrictions before purchasing. It was an opportunity to try a new place in the neighborhood to increase business exposure. My sister was visiting from Washington State and really wanted soulfood; thus, the reason we went ahead and paid full price. The food was, okay. This would not be my first choice for soulfood. I don't appreciate paying $25 for $50 worth of food through the Dining discount program to have it not honored (just because they did not want to that day). Probably, never again.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1615482653903, 'text': "We're sorry about your experience, Tenisha.

Ughhh... i dont even know where to begin. First off, customer service is lacking. I dont know if its because of poor training or maybe the young age group that ran the shift that day. However, as i was eating, a rat ran past and went behind the fish tank. I told the waitor with the dreadlocks about it in passing and he called out for me to “just pack my food up and leave then”. Found that to be very rude and suprised that that would even be a thing to say to someone. Then when i asked for some lemon for my fish, to a lady waitress, she just stood there staring at me like i was crazy. Didnt know what that was about. But when she came back with the lemon, they were cut up into slices that were so thin, it was impossible for me to squeeze. So i got up to ask at the front desk for a better slised lemon to squeeze on my fish and they told me “they cant be giving me no lemons like that”. At this point im really turned off by the quality of customer service. To top it all off, by the time i get home, i have food poisoning, diahrrhea all night and nausea. I dont know what was worse, the service or the food. Worse experience and will not be recomending this place to anyone. The service is shameful! Food poisoning happens so i cant be mad. But customer service should be something the owner should focus on with the staff!!</review>

Was excited to try this spot... and was very disappointed. I wanted ox tails.  When she said there weren't any yet, at 12pm, we should've walked out. But I always try to support minority owned businesses so we stayed. Ordered salmon croquettes and overeasy eggs. First,  the eggs came scrambled,  and it didn't taste like salmon.  Hubby ordered catfish and some mac and cheese. It was cold. Coffee tasted burnt. Service was slow, and there was only 2 other couples in the place.  Maybe will give them another shot,  but I hope they get better. Wish them all the luck to get back to what I heard they used to be.</Text>

<review>DISCLAIMER:  Long post below

I’ve visited Ms.B’s on multiple occasions (at least 5 times) and waited to leave a review as I wanted a decent sample size and to be objective and fair.

Pros: Outstanding customer service!  Each and every time I frequent, every staff member is pleasant, attentive and professional.

I’ve tried the fried catfish, red snapper, fried and baked chicken. The fried meats were hot and fresh but all lacked flavor and tasted very bland. I’m not sure if the intent is to allow individual seasoning but there was no flavor and not what I expected from soul food meats. The baked chicken was dry and bland. I ordered the baked chicken once right before closing so maybe that was a factor.

Sides:  mac-n-cheese and yams. The Mac-n-cheese is a personal favorite. Seasoned, flavorful every time. The yams are hit and miss—mostly miss. The yams aren’t sweet enough (personal preference) and are sometimes watery. The cornbread muffins are pretty good.

Breakfast:  I’ve tried the grits, eggs, sausage and salmon croquettes. I prefer thick grits. Sometimes the grits were thick, other times watery. The eggs, sausage and salmon croquettes were prepared to my liking.

I’ve noticed the fried foods are fresh and hot. The sides are only luke warm and get cold fast if there’s a wait and the food is delayed when brought to the table.

I think the prices are too expensive even for this area. Including tip, I paid almost $27 for one piece of catfish (although good size) 2 sides, cornbread and a large drink.

The wait times are excessive. I understand and respect that quality food takes time to prepare. However, there’s a difference between that and long wait times due to inadequately staffed personnel. I once waited 50 minutes for a breakfast order.

Multiple items listed on the menu are never available. In my experience, this is consistent among soul food establishments. Maybe there’s a good reason why this happens often.

Would I visit again??  The answer is yes!!!!  Here’s why:  I presume, Ms. B’s is a Black owned business. Her establishment is clean and as I mentioned above, the customer service is outstanding!  Outstanding customer service alone is always a plus for me and will keep me coming back. Another factor is I believe in establishing patience in supporting Black owned businesses. Too often, Black owned businesses are not supported and quickly disregarded only to patronize other non-Black under-performing businesses.

Ms. B, if you read this review, please don’t be offended. I offer this review out of love and respect. I feel it’s important to have frank, honest dialogue—even if we disagree without being offended. At the same time, as a patronizing customer, I expect improvements to be made when/where possible.

I appreciate your willingness to serve your community and your family. Blessings to you.< /review>< Pictures>

We went to  Ms. B's today and the service was below standard. We placed our order over the phone for pick up and upon arriving found that the order was wrong. This was twice this occurred. When we ordered I had the rep. Repeat my order twice which was correct. However, to no avail order still wrong. Additionally we ordered the banana pudding which was horrible.  It was too thick, gritty, taste like a box mix, not homemade and it was not smooth and creamy at all. Unfortunately we ordered a large which was almost $12.00, money wasted.  Also, ordered barbecue ribs, which came with no sauce at all. This is our last visit here.<//Review>

<Text>Very disappointing, I wish I would’ve read the negative reviews before going. Being from the South and cooking and experiencing good ole soul food, I was also disappointed to realize the owner is from Mississippi. But maybe we just caught it on a bad day. Smothered pork chops were good, but all 3 sides and the peach cobbler wasn’t worth eating.
Customer service was also lacking.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Unexpected gem so close to El Segundo! My partner's family is from mississippi and Ms B's food and care in serving us was so gorgeous, it was like one of his Aunts was in the kitchen! Lunch portions were large enough that my take home box was plenty for dinner, and my cornmeal encrusted catfish stood up to the microwave! Definitely on my must visit list whenever i come out to this area!</Review>

I live in Oakland CA but I treat myself to a two or three day trip to the L.A. area two or three times each year.  I do some shopping and sight seeing but the  main reason I go down is to visit M&M.  Their smothered pork chops, red snapper, collard greens, are to die for.  I am an author so I also go down to do book signings and lectures, but I always squeeze in a visit to my favorite restaurant, even if I have to get a to go order and eat in the limo on the way to the airport.  Keep up the good work Ms. B and I will be a customer for life!

Ordered through DoorDash, received food smelled and looked great. Got ready to eat no eating utensils, napkins, salt pepper ketchup or straws. BOOM go to the store major inconvenience while calling M&Ms back to see if mabe they could send some over since we did spend 75.00 on two plates!! No, here’s the managers number call her!! Call manager no response!! Get back eat food greens no meat or seasoning in greens bland and nasty. Gravy was thick and tasted like it came out a can or bottle no seasoning just heavy on the pepper. Only got 3 small oxtails and they were not falling off the bone thy were tough and had no meat on them. Corn bread was good and hot. Peach cobbler was cold like it was in the refrigerator. The lemonade and berry mix drink were the best things at this place. Still waiting on my call back from the manager 😩< /Review>< pics>

Felt bad coming here 30 minutes to close, but was really craving some fried catfish. It was very worth it, best catfish I have had in LA so far. Seasoned perfectly, and tasted amazing. The tartar sauce was good as well. Very affordable dinner combos, and great customer service. The only thing I would is that the fries weren't the best, but I wasn't there for them anyway! Would go to again!< /Text>

This is my all-time favorite restaurant. It’s like hanging out with family. The food is off the chain. #letsguide< /Text>

This place use to be the Best soul food in LA. Once they started serving baby portions, I stopped going. Craving soul food. I was on my way to Dulan’s soul food but their line was wrapped around the corner in 100 degree weather. Well, to the food. HORRIBLE!!! I even tried giving it to my dog and he wouldn’t  eat it. It tasted like bug spray. The meat was tough, the macaroni and cheese was like soup with a strange taste. I end up putting it in the trash, I was afraid it would make me sick. Please hire a professional chef!! It’s doesn’t hurt to hire someone that knows how to make soul food. You’ll make more money in the end. Paying the price for good food is what everyone seeks. My review is for that Location on Imperial In California. I can speak on those in other state. If you’re not going to pay a qualified chef. Lower your prices. It’ll stick with Dulan’s soul food.</Text>

Food was delicious and the service was fast. Google still lists this restaurant at the old Manchester address, but they've moved to a much larger location on Imperial Hwy. Large private space in the rear for events. Mrs. B the owner is great and full of conversation. Check them out, you won't be disappointed.< /Review>

Very small portions for the price paid all the veggies except the greens taste and smell straight out of a can with no seasoning. The sides don’t have any seasoning either not even pepper or spices on the yams. Only received 3 pieces of yams and 2 Oxtails and they were tough. Very disappointing< /text>

Chicken is so bland no flavor what so ever the dressing is super sweet taste like pure sugar and I like my dressing sweet so that’s saying a lot the only thing good is the Mac and cheese but not worth the hour wait or 20$ spent< /Text>

< Review>
M&M’s is some of the BEST soul food I’ve had outside my grandmother’s kitchen table . We were told that Dulan’s down the street was better, so we went the next day to try it. HANDS DOWN M&M’s was far greater! M&m’s greens were delicious flavorful and full of meat. Their Mac n Cheese was to die for. As far as I’m concerned there’s no comparison. Anytime I’m in town again it will be first place I go to.< /Review>

<Review>I spoke with several people local and non local and they suggested coming here for good soul food! So we did.  I think the prices were right in par for being a popular location. The staff was friendly, and despite the poor ventilation I was going to stick to out. Everything changed when I went to the bathroom. It was absolutely gross. Not the gross where someone just went to the bathroom. Not even the gross where  the facilities were old. First they had jars that could've once been decor but now seem like they're dust catching apparatuses. There was dust creeping up the walls and other places. No soap either. The creepy, dirty bathroom was a complete turn-off for me. I still have the smell of fried food in my hair and we were there for under 15 minutes.<//Review>< Response>

I can't even begin to talk about this place. The food may seem to be pricey, but for the amount you receive, it's really not. It's not often you go to a restaurant and all the food is good. Plus(and this is a big plus) They don't put sugar in all of the vegetables. Easily a 10 out of 10. The staff is amazing also.</text>

<time>1577920198205< /time><Rate>2</Rate><Review>General- for the price of the food, I expected better quality, especially being located in the hood. I will grade this restaurant on presentation, cleanliness, customer service, food quality, and price.

Presentation (4 out of 5) - it was a standard looking restaurant with a few memorabilia of the past hung throughout the place. Nothing looked broken and it seems like the dining furniture had been kept up to code. Also, they really love that Apple Pay machine.

Cleanliness (5 out of 5) - I didn’t see any major issues that jumped out to me or anything else for that matter.

Customer service (1 out of 5)- there were to many acting Queen Bee’s instead of regular old honey bee’s. They need to get one manager and stick with it. The girl at the register look all sorts of confused and this other lady kept hollering throughout everyone’s transaction. Then there was another lady hollering and going back and forth with people on seating arrangements. It just became a bit to much.

Food Quality (2 out 5) - I was very disappointed and only went to this place because the more famous restaurant Duland’s was closed on New Years. The catfish needed a lot more seasoning and the cook should know better than that. The mac and cheese was my least favorite dish and someone put way to much sugar in that Mac and cheese. The rice and gravy was(smh)... and let’s not get started on the smothered pork chops that were warm on the outside and cold in the middle. The only decent side item was the collard greens. I am not happy with this level of food quality, especially driving 40 mins to get here. That brings me to my next topic

Price (1 out of 5) the price that they charge for these dinners don’t match the quality of what they are trying to offer. The pork chops are $16.99 and the Catfish is 19.99. However, the only item included in the meal worth mentioning was the greens, which were decent at best.

Overall- this business needs a serious upgrade and the cooks need to improve on their recipes. 2 out of 5 is being very generous coming from me.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Easy to locate. Parking in rear of the building. Outside seating. Wheelchair accessible. Cozy clean environment on the inside. Kind and polite staff. Arrived at about 3pm, not too busy. Ordering was easy. Wait time was about 15 min total. Order was correct. Portions were decent. A bit pricy honestly but service was excellent and the food was filling so they get 5 stars. Good place for late lunch.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<response>None</response><pictures>None</pictures><review>To OWNER’S Grandson was acting as Manager/Server. He brought our drinks and thought our order for “Table #12.” Btw, we never received refills for our beverages. Then, we got warm cornbread-n-butter. Shortly we received our fried catfish and smothered pork chops. Well, here’s where everything goes WRONG. Unfortunately, the female waitress mistakenly took our side dishes to another table, and my hubby and I waited 30 minutes. I had to ask another male server to request our server to come over to our table. When he returned, he said, “yeah!” I informed him that we never received our sides. He went to the back and asked the Cook what happened to our food? He and the female server began arguing. Obviously, she took our sides to another table. My husband asked “how is this going to work, when my sides are hot and my meat is cold? Jared(Owners Grand/Acting Manager), said, well, I don’t know, I can heat it in the MICROWAVE.” After the Cook remade our sides, my husband was DONE! I had to as Jared for our check. He returned and I asked, “how can we make our experience pleasant, he replied, I don’t know?” I asked for the Owner/Manager on duty, he said, this is my Grandmother’s and I’m the Manager tonight. I asked if he could take my husband’s meal off, he said, he couldn’t. So, suggested that clearly he’s doing his Grandmother’s establishment a disservice due to his lack of restaurant savvy and lack of customer service skills, and  basic professionalism. So, he said, what do you want me to do? I reiterated, removing my hubby’s food, he said, he’d GET IN TROUBLE. I said, why would you ask me “WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? Clearly, it was s no win, and I paid our food, and told Jared/Owner’s Grandsonacting Manager, WE’LL NEVER VISIT THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN! So, he gave me “QUARTERS “ for my change because he said he DIDN’T HAVE ANY ONE DOLLAR BILLS!!!! We try to support Black establishments, but we received horrible experiences. In the HOOD!</review><GmapID>0x80c2b65545e57b41:0xb827f7130c6b08b2</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is an amazing place to get great soul food in a friendly atmosphere. The family owned restaurant provides friendly service to everyone and the food was delicious. I would encourage anyone to dine here for some great home cooked food. Bonus is that they provide parking for events at the Fourm so great opportunity to park and dine before a concert. I will return for more great food<//review>

<text>Great service and awesome food. The owners have origins from Mississippi, so there's a southern flare about this place. Being from Texas I appreciated that. I had shrimp with green beans, Mac and cheese, and gravy over rice.

<review>I had a wonderful dinner 20 years ago at M and M Soul Food. The food was so good I never forgot it and the portions were so generous. I went there again 20 years later and the experience was amazing and the food Sublime. Take your family here you will not be sorry. I will be back soon and it won't take me 20 years to enjoy it again.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I phoned the restaurant and they denied that they were serving yams from the can. Will I go back? NO!!!<//review>< pics>

<rating>5</rating><review>At smaller restaurants or chains, it can easily be hit or miss with both service & quality of food.   Such is not the case with Ms. B's M & M!   The service is really good,  but the food is insanely good!    It's slow-cooked & marinated to the bone.   My favorite is the short ribs, which literally fall off the bone into a succulent gravy reminiscent of really old school Southern culinary delightfulness!    You'll feel right at home & leave full.....with leftovers.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b65545e57b41:0xb827f7130c6b08b2<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>Service was slow but friendly and 2 of our party of 4 got sick from the food. It was rated a B probably because it is not all that clean and poor service. NOTE: This review is for the M&M’s restaurant by the forum not in Inglewood. I thought the food was good but after 2 of my family members got sick from it...I won’t be eating my leftovers.

Came for the $10 lunch special, and I was pleasantly surprised. This was my second time coming here and the food was tastier and not as salty. Friendly customer service, and the dining room is different than other soul food restaurants with t.v.'s and tons of decorations from the south. I would go back for the lunch special. You can't beat the amount of food you get for the price!< /Text>

Clean Dining Room, Delicious Food, Courteous, Friendly and Helpful Staff and reasonable prices. My only complaint if any is they fry their fish and chicken a little too hard, but it tastes delicious.</review>

Loved the catfish and BBQ chicken. The Obama drink (it's a non-alcoholic drink) was refreshing and sweet. 😊</text>

<Text>I was happy to see that this one had a drive thru, I expected to wait no biggy, but waiting an entire hour is ridiculous. The car behind me received their food before me. I went in and they said that the chicken takes about 15-20 min, this is after I have been waiting for 30 min, turned around and waited another 30 min, finally got my food and when I got home about to throw down I was highly disappointed. I ordered a chicken lunch with Mac/cheese and Yams. The Yams and Mac  were on point! The Chicken was hard as hell and taste burnt. I will NOT be ordering from here again. I rather drive further out to get better service, better quality food and a lesser wait time, then to come back to this location which is literally 5 min from my house.< /Text>< userid>

I have to truly say, this is by far the best soul food I have ever tasted. I've tried others and I would easily give them a thumbs down 👎. Excellent taste. Thank you Miss B for doing it right.</Text>

Compared to the various Soul Food places within the community, this M&M's is real stingy with their portion sizes. Any other place, I would have been able to take food home for later. And their pricing was way too high for what you get. The wait staff were very pleasant and the food was good though. I just expect more than a scoop of greens when I'm paying $40 for 2 ppl and no drinks/appetizers were ordered.< /text>

Dear M&m, wanted a casual breakfast at 9:30 on a Saturday morning but you weren't open! Saturday. 9:30am. Clearly now a lunch place.  So I went right up the street to Flipit that opens every day at 6:00am.<//Text>

My family and I went to Mrs B’S for dinner we are from Charlotte Nc. This is not the first time we have been there. We started going to the other restaurant back in the 90’s but this was the first time at the new one. The food was the best. All family members enjoyed it. They are already talking about coming back next year. I was bless to take a picture with Mrs B. She was so sweet and we were there Feb 4th 2018. We went there with our church. Thanks for the great food and God bless you and your family.</Text>

<text>1st time customer..After they forgot to include my peach cobbler with my order. The owner or mgmt asked the server if it was on the ticket..she says no. So I guess I'm lying about peach cobbler. They check the ticket..of course it's on there. 1st impressions are everything. I don't care if this food is good or not. I'm good. I started to demand a refund. You don't treat people that way.. especially paying over $20 for 1 meal!!!< /text>< Resp>

<text>First I'd like to say Inglewood!! Well I was invited here by a friend and although place is cute and friendly atmosphere it's to small for the amount of service they get needs more employees I guess.friendly staff , the food was okaee I expected more being the Mississippi feel they give off . I got chicken and pancakes. Nothing to hop and holler about no flavor in chicken pancakes were okaee. Eggs were watery but I guess. The water they give you tasted like it was ran from a faucet and they added ice the orange juice was good tho . And there were flies everywhere 🤔Debating on returning but for lunch or dinner</text>< Rating>

Took my mom and grandmother there for Mother's Day dinner. The server informed us they were out of few items, so we ordered from what we informed they had. After sitting and waiting for our food for about 20 min our server comes and informs us they are out of 3/4 of the items we ordered are sold out. Needless to say we left.
BTW they have a "B" rating, if you are a out that sort of thing</text>

<text>"FRUSTRATED"
Went to Ms B's M & M restaurant yesterday. I ordered the BBQ short ribs dinner. After dealing with someone who is new and was not well informed with the menu; I was finally able to place my order. Well it turned out that I waited over 45 mins only to get the wrongly prepared meal. My ribs had NO BBQ Sauce on them. Hard to understand why that oversight was made after I was extremely clear that I wanted "BBQ RIBS" - NOT GOOD!!</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Name>

Genaro provided efficient, apparently caring and friendly service to my wife and me when we dined at this hotel restaurant on an early departure stay at the LAX Marriott. The meat quality of the flat iron steak sourced from a premiere supplier was exceptional and the presentation cooked rare was perfect.<//Review>

The good is good but the price is too high for the small portions of the food. Not a good deal at all. I more than likely won't be back.</review>

The greens and cornbread was the only thing that was fresh to me. The liver was low-grade tough and stringy. The yams was straight out the can with a dash of sugar yuck. The gravy was made with flour and quite a bit of water.</Text>

Soul food cooked to perfection! Macaoroni was on the sweetside but still yummy. The chocolate cake was mouth watering and very moist. I also orders two wings which were huge, but a little undercooked ill order them extracrispy next time. It was expensive but filling.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmapID>

Very slow, this restaurant caters more to the drive through after placing order it took a hour and a half before our meal came out
At which time the meal was missing the meat that was still being cooked. The food was not that good and the service was horrible.</review>

< Review>
The collard greens weren't bad and the yams were ok but the potato salad had too much mustard in it. The fried chicken was over cooked, the breast very tuff and dry. The deserts were horrible !  We couldn't  eat them they were both so bad! I ordered blackberry  cobbler  and my husband ordered  banana pudding.  We have never tasted anything that horrible  ever!</Review>

I oredered a  cat fish breakfast with grits and eggs, I also ordered salmon ,by phone. They didn't gave me a price until I arrived... $41.00. Wow! Are you kidding! I get home with this expensive order and never tasted catfish so bad in my life. I called them back to change my catfish to another type of fish and they said the order would be ready in 20 min. 20 min later they called me back and said the order wouldn't be cooked until I arrived. You know what! Never mind. I used to love this place but my last 2 experiences were less than favorable. You can keep your $4 kool-aid and poorly cooked food. In my opinion they are greedy and the cook need to be fired. You lost a good customer. Smh<//Text>

No flavor in the mac n cheese. Corn bread was weak. The white girl at a soul food spot doing the drive thru must be new because she couldnt explain the lunch menu and looked confused. Plenty of Other black owned with only black staff soul food spot in LA</Text>

Who told these people they could cook fish. I mean yes, I've had good seafood here but I have also had terrible, terrible seafood here. (Depending on cook I guess)

Once a restaurant messes up on the seafood with me, im done.</Text>

The veggies were straight nasty. Glad that's the only thing I bought. The restaurant itself needs a makeover. The bathrooms we're also disgusting with a half working lock. It's a hole in the wall for sure. I won't be back.</review>

< Review>
The food I ordered today was terrible.
I ordered the oxtails plate, greens, black eyed peas,  and yams...

Blackeyed peas were horribly over seasoned and absolutely way too much salt.
Greens were over salted as well

Oxtails oh my God how can you mess those up totally oversalted. Just from one bite you could taste only SALT.

I was soooo disappointed today.

I sent my entire order back and read a book while my mother continued to eat her meal.....

This will be my last time patronizing this location.</Review>

<Review>I wish I was able to give a half of the star. 1st the service was horrible. I Love, Love to eat and my people's was are working in that restaurant but, they where really short. I give there customer service a 👎. All the sides except the greens where horrible. And the red snapper looked old. I took a picture and I can't even add it on here. OMG!!!! The biscuits they had the nerve to sell tasted, looked and tasted like they where just warmed up in the microwave. DONOT, I Repeat DONOT eat their. Go to the M&M's in Carson. Food is off the Chain. We would have went there but, we where in a hurry to get home.</Review></record>

<review>The food was cold and the service was crap when I went there before Christmas, but the place is ghetto and the waitress was new that short changed me $5. When I brought it to her attention she displayed major attitude telling me that her tip was automatic. Beware of the light-skinned older lady with the crooked afro.<//review>< username>

< review>
The best thing about this restaurant was that the toilet was clean and there was tissue to wipe with and soap to wash my hands with
Otherwise the food was horrible and I was given a sample size water WITH LIPSTICK AROUND THE RIM OF THE GLASS

the banana pudding was dry the ox tails were tuff the Mac and chesse was dry I was given corn bread muffins that were too cold to melt the butter
On top of that I hate to wait to eat the nasty food that I ordered because I was never given silverware to eat with STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION< /review>

The service was bad, the waitress was rude, and to top it off the food was already made. It was warmed in the microwave. It wasn't even hot.</Review>
