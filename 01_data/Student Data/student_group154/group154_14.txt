I love hot chicken! This place doesn't disappoint. It's every bit as good as Dave's   They also have pizza which I haven't tried yet, but admire the creativity. What separates them a little from the rest is the sauce. It's similar to what you find at other Nashville hot chicken places but has more seasoning. Very nice people too.<//Review>

It was realllly good! Those double dredged fries were so amazing and I got the chicken bites. I have one complaint though! I ordered the Nashville hot burrito for my boyfriend. It said there was chicken, fries, cheese & special sauce. Except there was full chunks of potato which made up most of the burrito instead of the fries. Also onions & bell peppers? So that was very misleading. Wish it was what the menu stated.< /Text>

<Text>If you’re looking for some comfort food with a twist, this is your place! Everything on the menu has been thought through and is so much more than your average chicken sandwich or mozzarella sticks - my favorites were the Kentucky fried cauliflower (so delicious!!), and the hot Cheetoh mozzarella sticks!! But you really can’t go wrong with anything on the menu. Will be returning.<//Text><Name>Hannah Stombler-Levine< /Name>< gmapID>

< Review>
The food here is ridiculously delicious. We ordered a Nashville hot chicken sandwich, the 9-spice chicken sandwich, and an order of their fries - all of it was amazing. The 9-spice was the family favorite and even just writing about it is making me drool. It had a kick but also depth in flavor.. can't wait to go back!</Review>

<Review>Decided to finally try this place since they recently opened up in here. Delicious hot juicy chicken.The fries were nice and crispy . The French roll was was nice and soft . Only wish that my tender was big as the French roll it came in. I will be back to try their wings and tenders on its own. Overall very good chicken for the price.< /Review>< pics>

The fries were crunchy on the outside and soft inside. The wings were crunchy and spicy so that was perfect. The Nashville chicken sandwich was delicious just the right amount of crunch. The spice was very on point!!! The cheese and pickles enchanted the flavor.

Pros: spice level was on point, crunch was amazing, love the side options
Cons: wish they had a storefront :(<//review>

Being from Singapore, few would get my craving for Mcspicy burger(cannot be found anywhere else than in a Singapore Macdonalds). This is it though, the closest I'll get to my dreams! The Nashville burger and the Evil Ex are super, though still not as spicy as I'd hope. Fries and chicken nuggets are dope too. Everything is fried to perfect crispiness and I'm a huge fan of their tangy sauce. Just LOVE.< /text>< Pictures>

I got the Chicken as Cluck wings with 9 pepper. Clucking delicious. Listed 9 pepper as "medium" spicy but seemed much spicier than mid-level. Can't imagine how spicy the Nashville could be.<//Text>

As a fellow Brazilian, anytime I'm craving a coxinha or pao de queijo, this place always hits the spot! I mean I can't for sure say it's better than my moms, BUT it's pretty damn close. Everything I've had from here has been super tasty, plus the people who work here are soo friendly!< /Review>

Food was disappointing, I ordered honey chicken and buffalo the batter was falling off very soggy and undercooked I had to put it in my toaster oven smh... the chicken empanada filling was like pot pie filling the fries and fried avocado were the only I enjoyed waste of money never ordering from here and wouldn’t recommend‼️‼️ These good reviews are lies</text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>I have to admit, I always thought I was one who couldn't handle spice...even the chili dust from eating popcorn chicken would set my mouth ablaze. With that being said, I never really enjoyed hot chicken sandwiches to it's full potential; I always opted for 'non-spicy'. My life changed 180 when I decided to give Chicken as Cluck's Nashville hot chicken sandwich a try...with ACTUAL spice! Oh My Goodness, the sandwich was sooo good! Although it was mild-medium spicy, it was a just the right amount spice that just meets my threshold. The chicken meat was very moist and the brioche bun was the perfect carrier. I gobbled it up and enjoyed every bite. To accompany the sandwich, I ordered sweet potato fries, which have a panko batter coating. This is great as the fries are extra crispy. Who doesn't love a good crunch?!

I'm glad that Chicken as Cluck was my gateway sandwich to the Nashville hot chicken sandwich world.< /review>< user_name>

I'm so glad they're still available for delivery!  I don't think you can find better tasting chicken in Portrero Hill than here.  My go-to meal is always the Mother Clucker and a side of their delicious potato crisps.  Be careful with your wallet though because when you see their menu, you'll want to get everything they offer!</Text>

<text>This is a cloud kitchen restaurant, which you can order through various of food delivery apps: uber eats, grub hub and doordash.

The food here is amazing, we had our nashville burger and its pretty spicy and hot but we love it. We also order unique avocado fries and battered sweet fries.

The best part of this restaurant is that they use top quality ingredients such as organic chicken. Unlike other restaurant, their fried chicken is also extremely juicy.

For the sauce, the chipotle af and secret sauce af taste really good and spicy. They also have ranch sauce but taste super good compare to the other one.</text>< response>

This is a faceless kitchen that only prepares food for delivery. I don't support these "cloud kitchens" competing for revenue from actual restaurants that live within the community.</Review>

The Nashville hot was the most delicious sandwich I’ve ever had.  Every bite had the perfect amount of crunch, the sauce and seasoning were dynomite, and the bun was as fresh and delicious as ever.  My mouth is drooling again just by thinking about it.  And do yourself a favor and GET THE AVOCADO FRIES!!<//review>

First time here. Came here for dinner,  and it is a solid 4+.  great flavor and selection of various fusion tacos. Our group especially loved the "Drunken Chicken".  Start with the drinks and appetizers and stay for dessert.  It's dangerously close to home,  so I'm sure we'll be back to try out again.<//review>

<text>I always get top notch service at Mas Tacos.  The food comes quickly and delicious every time.  There are so many awesome flavors on the menu for any mood you're in, but I have to get at least one steak and egg taco when I'm there.  I recommend it.  They have happy hour specials also.  I was also impressed with their COVID control methods.  My first indoor dining in almost a year!</text>< name>

Amazing selection of tacos at great prices.  The drinks however are far overpriced with very little alcohol.  I recommend drinking prior to dinning here if your goal is to catch a buzz.<//review>

<text>Most amazing spot quick bite and a quick drink you know after work or if you just want to stop by and have a lovely nice small taco. My favorite tacos is the Vietnamese pork I just prefer without peanuts other than that it was so so good. Also I love their minty margarita so delicious.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPULdabkeLqvN_nh8OM99dXORJqWL3Az_ESNHa6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQMjX0kKpZXC4BiUNkrncUuXVUrnFItmwRnisx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3aRrFniCQvIK-HDUcfrpWUTiiAf-G3ONy2INl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809ae5938f574175:0x4e5f66c30609b6cc</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great addition to the Palladio! Tacos are the main attraction served with several meat and a couple of veggie options. I had the butternut squash, braised rib, and Vietnamese pork. All were good but the squash was my favorite. We also ordered margaritas and my Huckleberry lemon was very good. The place has two outdoor seating areas, a bar, and dining room. Pretty noisy but in a fun way. They also serve there tacos bowl style if your looking for that.<//Text>

<text>I was able to order the Chilequiles with impossible meat substitute which was nice. It was very good and the Mas Madre was spicy but delicious. Definitely suggest this spot.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMATcSxfiWBxafP5QxyO9_HWannQAwfCd_5gyBf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x809ae5938f574175:0x4e5f66c30609b6cc<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
First time at Mas Taco Bar. The staff was friendly and the food was fresh. I ordered the drunken chicken bowl with brown rice. I asked about the rice - no white or wild rice is offered. The chicken was tender and the food was hot without having the bowl heated to 1000 degrees as with most Mexican restaurants. It has a sports bar feel with many screens either showing football or the world series. Casual dress code. The music was modern pop sound track.< /Review>

Service was slow in the beginning. It made a speedy recovery though. I had fish taco with blackened salmon. The cold brew with horchata cream was awesome.
Update: I keep coming back to this place. Great food. Great ambience. Great service. Today, I had "impossible asada". It tastes so good, it's hard to believe it's not meat.< /Text>

Tacos and drinks are amazing. The sad part is the service. When you pay top dollar for food, you should also get amazing service. I have had extra tacos that no one ordered. paying extra for cheese that didn't get put on the item. I guess it's difficult to make a tacos special.</text>

Food/drinks: Got the drunken chicken, baja fish, and butter chicken tacos. Out of all of them the drunken chicken was my favorite. The butter chicken was a bit too sweet for my liking but had to give it a try. Also got the Cadillac and watermelon basil margaritas. Both were very tasty but watermelon basil had the best flavor.

Service: the hostess was kind and helpful when figuring out the new online menus. Server was knowable and attentive. Didn't wait long for any part of our meal. Gave us space but also made sure we never wanted for anything.

Overall: would highly recommend for a quick bite or an after work happy hour.< /review>< resp>

Service was great. Tacos were bland and not very tasty. Drinks were good. Appetizer was also just okay. Got Mas fries and it was just okay. 50/50 on if we will go back.</review>

Very nice, atmosphere, food is decent but I wouldn't go back. The service was ok. We we sat at our table and the server was trying to rush us to order. We tried a variety of street tacos. All the ingredients were fresh but the combination was not very tasty, it appears they are trying to have salsa be the primary flavor driver.<//text>

<Review>Great concept. Tapas style, non traditional tacos. They even have Asian and East Indian inspired tacos. Since I love fried oysters, I ordered the fried oyster taco. I really enjoyed it. My husband ordered two tacos and I ordered two different ones. We both enjoyed our tacos.<//Review>< pictures>

We arrived and were the only ones at the time.  The hostess said it would be about 5 minutes for a table.  About 20 minutes later,  she came to seat us all the time handing out to-go orders. Finally seated and about 10 minutes later,  the waitress shows up and took our drink orders.  Awhile later,  she comes back and sets 2 margaritas in front of us. Possibly the worst drink we've ever had.  Then a guy showed up with part of our dinner and a while longer came back with the appetizer. The rest of our dinner showed up.  The waitress came back and we ordered some food to go home with and a different drink while waiting.  The dragonberry mojito turned out so bad we left them on the table. Again,  we have to wait for the waitress to bring the tab to us. It appears she had too many tables for one person.  Not going back.<//text>

AMAZING. Food was absolutely delicious (secret taco and blackened salmon taco) and the service from Janelle (server), John (server/bartender), and Brandon (busser) were top notch. Give these employees a raise seriously.

I work in the service industry (Marriott Sales) and I am all about the delivery, service, taste and overall experience/vibe of an establishment and Mas Tacos in Folsom NAILED it. I want to work there now. Haha

This is a direct reflection of management and Colin delivered. Spoke with him briefly and he is a great guy. It seems as though he gives his employees the ability to let their unique and individualistic personalities show through their professional but excellent service.

Props to you guys! Price was right on point too. I would 100% go back. (I went for lunch and early dinner both in the same day) that should prove my point. They have something special going in Folsom. Early PM and late PM shifts were great. Thank you Mas Tacos. Y'all rock!<//Text>

Service was slow in the beginning. It made a speedy recovery though. I had fish taco with blackened salmon. The cold brew with horchata cream was awesome.
Update: I keep coming back to this place. Great food. Great ambience. Great service. Today, I had "impossible asada". It tastes so good, it's hard to believe it's not meat.</review>

First time visiting and was not disappointed!! My husband and I shared the giant margarita which was delicious. Together we tried 8 different tacos. The drunken chicken was very good, as well as the duck confit taco! The host this evening was extremely pleasant and quoted us an accurate wait time. Our server (didn't catch his name) was helpful when describing tacos and also recommended his favorite. We were very satisfied with our visit. We will definitely be back!<//text>

If I did have to make a few criticisms, it's that our cocktails were mediocre, and our chips and quacamole were slightly bland (but fresh!). I highly recommend this place on behalf of their tacos and service. We will be back.<//review>< Date>

Mas Taco Bar has so much variety and it is great quality. You write your order on a tally sheet, then your server enters what you would like on their handheld device at your table. I've tried most of the tacos, and it's really hard to pick a favorite. They also have a monthly secret taco you can look up online, or just ask your server about when you get there. Definitely a place you want to go again and again.<//text>

Good food and variety. Get ready to pay $3-4 for a Taco! The Ambiance is nice and the restaurant is designed well. Outdoor seating is fun! Parking can be an issue.< /review>

<Review>Great little spot for small street tacos. Lots of flavors and $2 tacos on Tuesdays. They also give you chips and salsa with giant tortillas you break apart to make your own chips. That's either fun or more work depending on how you feel about DIY chips.<//Review>< pictures>

Amazing experience at Mas Taco bar! The chips, salsa, and guac were fantastic and the service was speedy. Fresh small eats tapas style with lots of taco and other options to choose from.  A little expensive but absolutely worth the price once you finish your meal.  Give them a try!</text>

<Text>Trendy restaurant with a unique atmosphere. My wife and I were excited to try this place out. We ended up trying like 7 different tacos. We only really cared for 2 of those 7 (the braised short rib and pork belly). Good house margarita. Good churros for dessert. Overall a good spot for dinner at a reasonable price point.<//Text>< pictures>

What a fun addition to Folsom. I've already been back over 4 times and each time I bring new friends. Drinks are bomb and so are the tacos. Not your normal street tacos which makes it so unique from a normal Mexican restaurant. Whether you sit inside or outside the vibes are fun and inviting. HIGHLY recommend starting off with the MAS fries and a Dragonberry Mojito. And for the main course definitely the Drunken Chicken, Banh mi Shrimp, and Beer Batter Fish tacos. A big big recommendation from my boyfriend is the Steak and Egg taco. Whether you sit inside or outside the vibes are fun and inviting. Enjoy xx</text>

Ask about the secret tacos, you won't be disappointed 🤫

<Text>I’m so excited this is coming to Folsom! Construction
Is underway and the Palladio website says it will be opening soon. They are currently hiring for all positions. Mad Taco in Sacramento gets great reviews. We really needed a great taco bar in this area. There have been a couple other cantinas, but nothing of this caliber. I’ll be first in line when it opens and a full review is to follow.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Not good. Very pricey and meals don’t include chips. We ordered chips, and when we asked for a refill (because they only give you are very small amount) it took them 15 minutes to bring more. Tacos were just ok and VERY tiny, not at all worth the price. Slow service. Overall, poor experience.< /review>

Always delicious, decided to try the churros and they were amazing. The server didnt understand that I asked for a side of guacamole and charged me 8 dollars for chips and guacamole when I had already ordered chips and salsa. I dont understand how half of an avocado worth of guacamole costs 8 dollars.</Text>

Went there to try the place for the first time last Thursday and sat at the bar as I often do because service is usually better. Not at this place. I sat there and sat there and finally waved a bartender down to get a drink. In fact, I had to wave the bartenders down every time I wanted to order something. They were a little busy, but not bad and there were three bartenders working. When I got my drink, there was something floating in it. I waved the bartender down (again) and he quickly apologized and got me a new drink. The thing is, he asked me if I wanted a new straw.  Yes, of course. If you're replacing a drink because something gross happened in the preparation, I think a good bartender would start with a clean glass and new straw.

We tried several of the food items, starting with ceviche. Utterly tasteless. This did not bode well for any of the other items we tried. The tacos looked good, but were completely bland. It is like they use a Star Trek replicator to prepare the food. They know what it's supposed to look like, but have no idea how it should taste. Pretty bad for a place with "tacos" in the name.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>After a long day of moving, 4 adults were soooo hungry! But with gluten free and vegetarian among us, we had a hard time finding a place we could all enjoy.
Luckily, my husband remembered me saying months ago that I wanted to Mas Taco Bar. It also happened to be the birthday of one of our party, so we went in looking for a lively vibe, good food and cocktails.
We we NOT disappointed at all!! It was a Saturday night, and the place was poppin! We were able to get a seat right away, but I think a wait started just after us.
We had a great meal...the Mas Marguerita is awesome and we had many. The vibe was fun and loud with lots of laughter throughout the restaurant.
Meat, fish, chicken, vegan and vegetarian options and since their corm tortillas are DELISH it works for GF peeps too. Their corn shells totally changed my mind about I only liked flour tortillas btw.
All ingredients are FRESH and bright and did I mention delicious?
NOTE: Tacos are $3 each, but they are street tacos meaning tiny.
WARNING: This place can get costly. The tacos are addictive and an average adult male will eat anywhere from 6-10 to be filled. The drinks and oh yeah...the GUAC and CHIPS is INSANE so you will definitely want to have that (free chip refills...and when you try them you will definitely want refills)...and don't miss dessert...the price can sneak up on you.
That said, we had a great meal, great service, and a great time so well worth it.
TAKE AWAY: Awesome place for a family style, hang out, eat and drink for a couple hours night out< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x809ae5938f574175:0x4e5f66c30609b6cc< /Gmap_id></record>

<resp>None< /resp><Pics>None<//Pics><Text>It is a great place to sit outside on a nice day. The jalapeno margarita was on point.  I love that the tacos are a la carte and one per order so you can get a good variety and don't have to deal with all of the rice and beans. I was a bit disappointed though they don't offer a traditional grilled fish taco or shrimp taco. Just got back from Cabo and I've been craving them!</Text>< user_id>

<Text>First we were told in order to get happy hour prices we'd have to sit at the bar. There were no available seats. Or sit outside on front patio...its unbaringly hot outside. Slightly annoying but it's just a few dollars savings. We get seated and our waitress was really nice and explained everything  really well (probably should give two stars for this) But the food......quality is just not there, it was luke warm and lacked any real flavor. The corn tortillas taste like they are from the grocery store and kinda stale.. It's really just an over hyped place. Margaritas were pretty good but $10.00 for a glass that whiskey over ice is served in. Really small and mostly ice. I have no problem paying for craft cocktails but this was not a craft margarita.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x809ae5938f574175:0x4e5f66c30609b6cc< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Quite a confusing presentation with all tacos ordered were served "family" style on 2 serving plates in the middle of our table. It felt pretty spendy to us, 8 street tacos and 2 beers for $51.</review>

Didn’t like the food we tried every kind but they all didn’t have any taste and they came out very suggy. Sorry that we won’t go there anymore it was our first and last cause the place and atmosphere is very nice. The margaritas were ok I guess</text>

<Review>The online registration/appointment system is a joke. I registered around noon, the system gave me a spot at 5pm, then kept pushing it to 7pm. Turned out a girl at the front desk could not reach me (even though I was available) and removed me from the line. She was not very friendly overall.
Medical personnel inside seemed knowledgeable and quickly helped me.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dcaa1297745463:0x1611497bf26301d3< /gmapID></record>

I had a great experience at this urgent care.  I am reading all of these other reviews,  and I can’t wrap my brain around it.  My experience was positive from start to finish.  The front desk staff were kind and warm when I spoke with them.  Dawnee Bennett helped me in the back, and was super gentle and very kind.  I would go back there in a heartbeat.  Especially during these times, they have gone above and beyond to ensure that their facility is a safe place.<//review>

<Text>Horrible. This place is a joke. I checked my son in online, arrived in time, was third in the queue, and with the click of a button the girl at the front knocked him to 14th. Claiming that the online check in/ registration didn’t really mean anything. I had multiple text messages and a queue update that said otherwise.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

This place is scam! I have tested twice here for Covid, was told right away they don't accept insurance for the rapid test, WHICH IS NOT TRUE! THEY ARE REQUIRED TO! It's $195 for a test, and the staff is not able to help you log in, to get your results. The parking lot is FULL of trash, not one trash can in sight, when the line is wrapped around the corner. I will never ever take a test again here, this place is joke and a scam!</review>

< Review>
I made an appointment here (i have health net insurance) and they said they don’t take it and wasn’t able to get a covid test and if i was to if would cost me a few hundred dollars for lab fees. I was upset but not because they didn’t take me in but because i had to be in line where there was no social distancing and everyone coughing and my appointment line is literally 3feet from people in the non appointment line. On top of all this i seen 2 workers in the back with no mask.<//Review>

Avoid! They tell you to wait in your car and they will call you for covid testing. Waited 2 hrs, nothing. .Asked what happened and they said another 30 minutes. Then they texted me my appt was canceled. Try any other place, this is a waste of your time and money<//review>

This place is horrible, I can't even say it's a joke because it's not funny. Myself, my wife and several of our coworkers were recently tested here for covid-19. After being exposed at work to a positive covid case, and paying $195, each, for rapid testing, each of us got negative test results from this clinic. Within the next week, multiple people on our team were showing symptoms and received positive covid test results from other locations. If you just want to go back to work and don't care whether you have covid, go here and they'll get you back to work, if you actually want to know whether you have it, go anywhere else</Text>

<review>Took my mom for Covid19 testing on 11/6/2020 as a requirement from the airline  to have been tested no more than 72 hours before her flight. My mom was supposed to flight that night. We paid $175.00 cash for a rapid test that came back positive when we received the call and they asked if my mom had symptoms we were shocked on the positive results because she has not gone out and pretty much isolated to avoid exposure since covid began.  Then the person calling us with the results said they have had some patients coming out with false positive results. So they were awared of this issue but did not informed us before the test. There is 5 of us at home and we all had to be tested. My wife and me had to missed 2-3 of work until our results came back from a different testing site. We all came back negative  Also took my mom to Kaiser and had her retested and she missed her flight while waiting for her other results which were negative.   Called this urgent care back today to see if we could have my mom retested and get the letter for which we paid cash so she can travel.   Besides getting attitude and the feeling they don't care about their patients just their money they refused to give us the letter and stated we had already received their service and now its not their problem.  Do not recommend this place.< /review>< pics>

WARNING: They will force you to wait in a small waiting room with other covid testers. You will wait at least 2 hours even if you made an appointment online.

Double check your insurance is accepted here ahead of time. They do free testing if you do not have insurance.

Don't bother making an appointment for a Covid test. We made an appointment and arrived 10 minutes early. After checking in our estimated wait time was 2 hours.

Wait time isn't a huge deal but forcing people to wait indoors, and yell out their names instead of texting or calling is a bit strange. I would expect a medical center to be aware of increased transmission risks by forcing people to wait indoors in a tight space.

Back in August they used to come to your car in the parking lot for sample collection, wonder what changed..< /Text>

PLEASE AVOID THIS URGENT CARE. DO NOT EVEN BOTHER COMING HERE!!! I checked in at 6:00pm for a Covid test for work. Was told to come back nearly 3 hours later. I came back 2 hours later to check in again and asked to be texted when they were ready to see me. 1 hr and 1/2 goes by sitting in the car with no text. I go back in and wait another 25 minutes just for me and another patient waiting to be told THE DOCTOR LEFT FOR THE NIGHT!!!!! Then the front desk nurse had the AUDACITY to offer me the test for $200. I said no and she gave me the mangers supposed number which rang right back to the front desk she then said if I didn’t want to leave she’d call the “authorities” which she did and I explained to them exactly what happened and they agreed this place was in the wrong!! WORST EXPERIENCE I’VE EVER HAD AT ANY DOCTORS OFFICE EVER. DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE. THERE’S BETTER PLACES TO GO< /Review>

AVOID AVOID THIS URGET CARE. All I wanted was to get my test results emailed to me and after calling them many times and being hung up on while in the middle of conversation to then going strait to voice-mail. They want me to drive to them to get a copie of my results even though I live an hour away.< /review>

<review>I came here after being sick for 8 days. My lymph nodes were swollen and painful and my stomach was swollen. The first "PA" came in and asked what was going on. I explained how much pain I was in and that ibuprofen wasn't helping. I WAS NOT ASKING FOR PAIN PILLS. Just trying to explain how bad the pain was. He patronized me and said that I probably threw up the ibuprofen before it could take full effect and treated me like a drug seeker. So apparently he was just the assistant to the physician assistant so here comes another "PA". He said he couldn't feel that my lymph nodes were swollen??? Idk if they have just never touched someone who is overweight but I ended up going to the hospital later that night and they were in shock at how hard and swollen they were. The PA said all he could do was treat my symptoms. I was upset and asked for them to at least check for mono or something. You know, do any kind of testing AT ALL. Maybe if I got the chance to see a real dr it could have been different. I'm not sure if he lied about the mono test out of pride because I asked for it, but the results came back from my primary dr and guess who has mono? I went in 40 mins before close and could hear the nurse straight up whining from in my room about how late she was there the night before and how bad she wanted to go home. Meanwhile I was alone in that room on the verge of tears, afraid for my life. I understand caregiver fatigue is a thing but take a break when you need it so you don't make patients feel like even worse when they are already down. Also the assistant to the assistant (first pa) walked out with a large bag of candy and an energy drink, yikes.</review>< user_name>

I wish I could give this a 0 star. I don’t have insurance so I’m always concerned about how much I’ll have to pay. As soon as I came in, the ladies started giving me attitude about why I was there. She said right away “Well, we’ll see you but we’re probably gonna send you to the ER.” I told them I’d have to pay thousands of dollars for that, and she said “Well, it’s gonna be pretty pricey here too.” What is this? Is this how you treat people who are unwell and seeking care? I couldn’t stand it. I am not a product whose purpose is for doctors to profit off of. Please don’t go here.</Review>

Still waiting for covid-19 testing after making an online appointment online. It has been about two hours and they told us it would be a few minutes roughly an hour ago. My pizza that I ordered two hours ago for a future order is most likely ruined and I still have no clue when I will be called back because their screen with wait times keeps making my wait time increase from 8 minutes when we first arrived to 25 minutes now.<//Review>

Very satisfied! As a nurse that has worked in many clinics, this one operates very efficiently and is AFFORDABLE. Had to pay out of pocket as my insurance is out of state. The prices are posted in the waiting area- what you see there is what you will pay, simple and honest. They have a waiting board for check ins that tell you your estimated wait time. From door to door: check in, new patient paperwork, waiting, assessment, and antibiotic medication in hand was 45 minutes.  This place runs efficiently which is very helpful to sick patients! Keep it up. Staff was also nice and helpful.< /Text>

<text>I had to go in for a medication refill during the weekend since I could not contact my primary doctor.  This was my first time visiting this urgent care and I was blown away! The office was very clean, all staff that I encountered were friendly, and the check in process was quick and highly organized. I was lucky to come during a non-busy time and waited about 10 minutes - tops!! In and out in under 30 minutes!

<text>Every time I have came here in the past I've had a pleasant experience. Not this time the medical assistant or whatever he is was a jerk! He's asking questions but not really wanting to listen to the answer. I understand it's late and you've been here all day but that's not a reason to be rude when a child's sick. Work on your bedside manner. I'd recommend coming in the morning, you'll get much better service.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Made an appt for COVID testing. Walked in 10 mins before the appt time to check in (as their reminder txt message said to do) and the receptionist said I could not wait inside and the person who was in charge of the testing was on lunch and wouldn’t be back for another 30 mins. I said okay what about my appt? She said “she will call you when it’s your turn in line”. 2 and half hours later, after waiting in my car, I decide to go home. Why have an appt system if there is no real appts? I understand places might be understaffed and taking precautions but they could’ve at least communicated the circumstances instead of having me wait like an idiot. So rude.<//text>< Pictures>

If I could give his Urgent Care ZERO stars, I WOULD! This is my first time here, I've been waiting in the waiting room for TWO HOURS! I used to go to an urgent care in highland, but I recently moved close to Redlands Urgent Care so, here I am. I would've DEFINITELY drove the extra miles to basically, ANY OTHER Urgent Care had I known how rediculously SLOW this place is! Not to mention the front desk lady's attitude (she's lucky I don't know her name)! OH and how they HIGHLY prioritize the ones who “checked in” online. So if I were you, I'd check in online waaaayyy before coming in, or better yet.. go to the second closest urgent care. This place seriously needs some better time management and a more organized way of helping the patients in need.
And I haven't even interacted with any nurses or doctor's to see if they are just as horrible.
I'll be ranting on about that later I'm sure..</Text>

I ussually love this urgent care but yetsterday when I went i was percribed Benadryl and Ibuprofen for a sore throat and a stiff neck ? Thia absolutely makes no sense. The doctor literally took a 1 second glance at my throat. Didnt even really examine it because when i look at my thraot theres bumps which hurt servearly when i swollow . I am very upset that i will have to get another babysitter and make more time to go to a DIFFERENT ugernt care that ACTUALLY cares about there pateints .< /Review>

<Text>I was recommended here an employee of beaver medical clinic because my insurance isn’t linked to them, but on my insurance it shows it is, anyways she told me to come here because they take almost any provider, I did. I went in. Doctor seen me, checked me and prescribed my medicine. Very quick and smooth. Staff is great. Doctor is great. Only downside to this my pharmacy was closed so I bought over the counter meds to help me combat my ear Infection. Overall, I give it 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>This is my family's new urgent care office for sure. We used to use Beaver Medical, but without fail we'd be there just waiting for 2+ hours. Redlands Urgent Care has never kept us there for much longer than 1 hour total. We've been there several times (family is accident-prone) and they're fast, clean, professional, and overall great. Highly recommend it to fellow United Healthcare customers!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Just went in with clear symptoms of Sinusitis. Was seen by a P.A. who was fairly polite, but quite dismissive. I clearly stated my symptoms, he looked in my ears and told me to proceed with "symptomatic control" as he turned around, left the room and wished me a great weekend.
If I took the time to go to urgent care, it's obviously because the OTC "symptomatic control" approach has not been working for me. I don't think I'll waste my time or money going back to a clinic where the provider will not take the time to even figure out what the patient expected from the visit.< /Review>

Came here the other day and the guy at the front desk with the glasses kept rolling his eyes when I asked him a simple question had a lot of attitude. I'm a medical assistant and I worked in an urgent care. That's not how your supposed to treat people especially if they are sick. I think he needs to find a new job.<//Text>

Wait time is much less than beaver urgent care ..
But doctor was in too much hurry and hardly listened to me .
After steroid shot I was in extreme pain for a minute but nurse immediately opened the door and says go to front office while she was saying that I had difficulty getting up. Left the door open reminding that I should be out now.< /Text>

<Text>I just visited their office and cannot be more pleased. I have a chronic illness and frequent urgent cares/outpatient clinics to help maintain my health. The office was spotless, the staff were pleasant and the care was high quality. I was in and out in less than an hour with prescriptions sent to my pharmacy. I really appreciated my visit today because there is nothing worse than spending and ENTIRE day at a medical facility. I won't be going anywhere else! Thanks, guys!</Text>< Pictures>

I have now been misdiagnosed 3 times that I’ve came here. The most recent the PA diagnosed me with strep throat without ever even using a rapid results test. Bullcrap place to go if you value your health. Will never return. Better to go to the ER then here.<//Text>

I took my daughter there. The Neon "Open" signs were on and the doors were unlocked. When we went in, a girl told us they weren't open yet and made us go back outside. They open at 9am. So I asked her what time was it? It was 8:57.  I asked why do you have the all the "Open" signs on with the doors unlocked? Made us go back outside for 3 measly minutes. Needless to say I went to Beaver Urgent Care where we've always been treated right. So much for giving the new place a chance. 👎🏼 -⭐️<//review>

<review>Checked in online for an appointment at 11:03. Arrive 10 mins early to be told I have to wait 45 mins. Why offer an online appointment service if the appointment doesn’t really exist. Idiotically under staffed for the begging of flu season, only one provider working. This place has gone down hill fast. Do yourself a favor and seek treatment with an honest organization with integrity.< /review>< pictures>

Never will we go back. The doctor that seen my son was awful. She told us my son had a pulled muscle when it wasn't. She didn't run any blood test nor take an xray. We told her that he wasn't eating that all he wanted to do was sleep and in lots of pain. She sends us home not a word bout follow up with your primary if it gets worse or go to another place for xray which she could have done there. Well we come home and he is still in pain turning a light yellow so we took him to redlands community hospital and they did blood work and a ct scan. They came in and told us that our son would need an emergency surgery to remove his appendix. So they called loma linda hospital to have an ambulance come get our son and they took him and did the surgery. They told us his appendix started to leake and we we here lucky to catch it on time. I'm so glad I didn't leason to that doctor who didn't do her job</Text>

I went for a strep throat test and I was appalled by the customer service.  The receptionist was excellent, however, while I was waiting for my culture results I overhead the medical staff gossiping and cursing about patients through the door.  I head the nurse who swabbed me say that my test was a complete waste of his time, and especially because it was negative!  It was horrible and I was brought to tears while I waited 15 more minutes for the doctor to come and tell me my swab results, which I already knew.</text>

Remember these names; Staci, Desari, Jamie and Sidney.  While I suspect the rest of the staff here is far above par, these people are AWESOME!

I'm one of those people who have a tricky genetic blood disease.  If improperly treated, I can bleed out. This makes me very concerned and hyper vigilant in my medical care. So many urgent care facilities haven't bothered to educate themselves before examining me or deciding my treatment.  I haven't been happy with the quality of the urgent care facilities in this area. From the moment I went into the doors of those other places, it's been all down hill.  Because of this, I was extremely tense when I entered the doors of REDLANDS URGENT CARE CENTER.

OH MY GOSH!  I literally have used urgent care facilities all through the United States. REDLANDS URGENT CARE CENTER is far the best place I've been. The moment I went through the door I was greeted. The receptionist quickly asked me questions, acted on those answers and enrolled me as a patient.  There was only one other person in the lobby. She said she was always given amazing care there.  They took her immediately.

As soon as I signed my name, I was taken to an exam room. My vitals were taken and the nurse practitioner immediately came in.  She was able to identify the cause of my discomfort right away. She clearly explained it and I was reassured she understood the critical issues in my care caused by my genetic blood disease. As I kept asking questions to reassure myself that I wasn't being given medication which might prove very dangerous to me, she remained patient, positive and informative. I felt like she was content to stand right there as long as I needed her!  Yes, she chose medications safe for me to take and I feel so much better today.

The facility was pleasantly decorated. It was clean, organized and smelled fresh. The furniture was tasteful and in good repair.

On a scale of one to ten with ten being the best......this business and the people taking care of me were easily 1,000 each.  They are what those one to tens are trying to be when they grow up.

I highly recommend this business.  Since I have to go 71 miles one way to USC for my medical appointments and scheduled care, I was eager to find a safe place for me to go for a cold, a sore throat, etc.   I'm so happy to finally identify the type of care I've been looking for.

Thank you REDLANDS URGENT CARE CENTER and a very grateful thank you to Jamie, Sidney, Desari and Staci!<//Text>

Its been a while since having had any type of medical procedure. Ive always dreaded doctors offices, but my visit was quite pleasant. The medical asst were friendly,kind, and comforting. It was a nice surprise feeling confortable instead of wanting to run out!The doctor who performed the procedure was great. explained everything n detail beforehand and answered every Q i had. felt like i was the only patient he had, wich was quite the contrary! Many Thanks to all Staff and Doctors.< /review>

< review>
This clinic is VERY clean and when I went in last night during peak flu season, I was the first in line with a less than 10 minute wait to be seen. This is the end of my compliments. My vitals were taken, but werent shared with me. I complained of a cough and other flu like symptoms yet my breathing wasnt listened to. "We can treat this like the flu," is what the PA told me. I wasnt very symptomatic when I went in, but I was very surprised that my vitals nor temperature were shared with me, and that my lungs werent given a listen. Im disappointed in this aspect of the care I received. But again, I was in and out in less than 30 minutes with prescriptions in hand. Thats something. Go at own risk?< /review>

Waste of time. The front desk staff has no idea how to check insurance or the policies of the office. Go to your normal doctor or the ER. This place is a rip off.< /text>

<review>First off I just want to thank 2 employees for being extremely helpful and professional.  These 2 women who’s names I hope I’m getting right are Liz & Keisha.  From the initial phone call with Liz to the actual in-person intake with Keisha these 2 woman were extremely cordial and non-judge mental.  I found myself in quite a predicament due to my unsatisfactory spending habits, but instead of shaming me Keisha offered sound financial advice and to my surprise she did it without sounding condescending😆.  Bottom line these people at Speedy Cash are amazing and I was actually approved for a $3,500 dollar loan which I’m hoping will help turn my credit around.  Thank you Speedy Cash!!< /review>< Pictures>

I applied for a loan online & didn’t get approved. The next day I got a call from Liz telling me she might be able to help me & ended up getting me approved. She was very professional, friendly & knowledgeable. She also got me in & out of there quickly. The service was great
Thank you Liz< /review>

<Review>Honestly, going there for the first time I thought it would take long and be a hassle. Julie really surprised me by how efficient, professional and fast she helped me. Her customer service skills is amazing. She was easy to talk to, has a kind personality and made the process less stressful. I was in and out the door with my loan and no time. It was way better than I anticipated.</Review>< user>

My boyfriend came in to apply for a loan, and this whole process was really easy. He received the cash right away! We called so many other places and this was the only place that allows you to use your debit card to secure your loan instead of using checks!! We are really happy with the service we received. Thank you Speedy Cash<//Review>

<Text>The staff I worked with, Juliana and Liz, provided adept knowledge, excellent customer service and both ladies were quick to greet me with a smile. The ladies showed patience when explaining the process or paperwork. Getting a Payday loan for the first time, was an easy process. I believe that Juliana and Liz are a huge part of the reason my experience was stress- free, uncomplicated and pleasant. Thank you Juliana and Liz!!!</Text>< rating>

I want to take time out of my day to thank a special employee here who went out of her way to help me today. I was having a very stressful day Having paid all my bills and being broke I got stuck in a dilemma where my car was towed and I was facing a 300$ fine to be able to get my car back , having been to many loan places and getting a lot of unnecessary attitude from other places I’ve been to it was nice to see that some places still have employees who genuinely make you feel comfortable and helped out to the fullest.Thank You Kimberly! For exploring all my options with me and helping me get my payday loan and turning my day around! I have definitely found a new home to do business with for future favors! Thank you again<//text>

When asking for a manager I was told 2 different people were managers yet they refused to give me their names for my complaint to be filed with corporate as if they knew they would get fired.

Exceptional customer service is the standard we hold ourselves to and this doesn't meet our standard.

<review>I like Speedy. Most workers are very friendly and courteous. The only times that are crowded has been when only one or two workers were available, and caused a 45 min. wait in line. Other than that the wait is about 15 min. at the most.< /review><user>113571962822981252639<//user><date>1575244004207<//date><name>Mary Woodward< /name><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

i got to speedy cash at 5 pm there were people in line for over an hour waiting to be seen went i got to the front they were rude and they needed to verify information from the bank and they were not able to do so because the banks were closed at 6 pm this location needs new staff because they are extremely rude with no customer service skills whatsoever  if i could give this place a 0 i would, be cautious going here for any kinds of service.</review>

I had have good experiences in the past, however this last time was horrible. The lady Marlen, is very rude and unprofessional. Everyone else has always been very nice, except for her. When I asked to speak to a manager, she said that was her and there is nobody above her. I find that hard to believe, which is why I am glad I just received an email, inviting me to leave this review about my experience! Don’t work with the public if you can’t be nice and treat people with dignity and respect.< /review>

WORST customer service at this office! They're slow, unprofessional, they all have bad attitudes like they don't want to be there. If they say they'll do something & they don't, instead of taking ownership, they TRY to make excuses. Definitely avoid this office. I called in to let them know I was coming in to pay my loan and was told on the phone that was okay. Got to their office and was told they're already attempting to pull it. Thankfully,I have an awesome bank on my side. I've been waiting for a manager to get back to me (because I asked them for the recording where I was told I was allowed to pay in store) for over a week and nothing! Definitely a shady company.< /review>

The employees there are job knowledgeable and friendly.  Also easy on the eye.   The only pitfall for me is parking..EXTREMELY limited.    P.S.   Since it is  a first come first serve basis I think someone can greet customers as they enter hopefully being aware o f who's next.</Review>

<text>Bad service with bad management.  Had my girl and I do the runaround. We live in imperial beach. To have us go back to grave her registration so she can get a loan, then they tell us that her car is being used by me when I got my loan 3 months ago.  well we never found her registration. So the next day she go's and paid for a new registration. Now they tell her that she really didn't need her registration just the insurance. So she used my truck info when she could of done that yesterday when I was there with her. But since her name was not on my registration they could use it.
It pist me off the first day. Today ... Well I had to post this.< /text><UserId.>111636451288804983425</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

They all see nice here. But I don't like the fact that one can't make payments so unless I just happen to have  $300 there is no other options. They are always trying to get you to take out another loan or trying to get you to buy the tv or computers available which is you have the money it I believe helps build up your credit if you pick to do so. And I wish that they didn't give the same speech every time I already know $45 is taking out due to whatever the interest rate is if it's someone new I understand but I could probably recite their speech if I bothered to pay attention to it cuz I've heard it enough times. Beyond that they are nice.<//Text>

<text>went in for some money orders. Gave them cash but they "went to the back" to count it and came back $90 short and continued to get the count wrong as gave them more. so i left and went to my bank which had the same count as i did and counted it right in front of me.

Tyler was great with my loan process, he was very helpful. He made me feel like we had been friends for years and made me feel like a priority. The loan process was explained well and any questions I had were promptly answered. I would definitely recommend Tyler and Bay equity to anyone looking for a loan.</Review>

<text>I have worked with many Mortgage Lenders in the past and by far Bryan Horner and Bay Equity have been the best. Bryan is very knowledgeable and made the process very easy.  I got a great rate, he saved me the appraisal cost,  closed quickly and received some cash back at closing. Could not of asked for anything more.< /text></record>

< Review>
I had a wonderful experience with Bay Equity and Christine Farrington with our VA Home Loan. I would highly recommend them to any Veteran looking for people who actually care about what they do for a living.  I was so impressed with how effortless this was! After wasting my time with other lenders who eventually fell through Christine and Bay Equity gave us hope that we could do this.  We closed our loan on time and our family is enjoying the new house! Thank you so much for helping us make this dream a reality.</Review>

Top-notch service from start to finish. Layla's communication was superior to any I have ever experienced with a mortgage process. Her incredible availability, reliability and response times combined with very competitive rates/fees were exceptional. I am self-employed so I know for a fact she had to put in a lot of extra work and some after-hours calls to get my deal closed quickly and on time (21 days!). Layla will be my go-to for all mortgage needs in the future.</Review>

I am a first time home buyer; so I had a steep learning curve. Toby was able to get me the best rate possible, while still being brutally honest with me about everything the loan required. I never had to wait on Toby for anything. He was always on “top of it” to ensure a timely closing date. I’ll be much more prepared for future home purchases because of what I learned from Toby.<//Text>

<text>Liz and her team GETS STUFF DONE! We came to Liz half way through our buying process with little hope of being able to buy the home we wanted. But Liz went above and beyond to get the absolute best loan for our situation. She is an incredible problem solver. Every curve ball we threw at her, she handles Immediately and with a positive attitude. Her response time was so fast! You felt like her only client, and there were no stupid questions. We will forever recommend Liz Harper!< /text>< Pics>

<review>Chris and his team are utterly outstanding! Nothing stops them from achieving the very best for you! Every step of the way they went out of their way to achieve the best rate for my loan! I have never felt such true caring when it came to the well being of my future and the home refi process. My praise could continue on and on of them! The Chrome team is truly the VERY BEST!!<//review><Response>None< /Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Incredibly helpful throughout the process. I felt like I didn’t have to do much of anything which was very easy and didn’t create any stress. They put together a special binder just for me containing all my documents at closing and I really appreciated the attention to detail and felt special. They also included a bottle of wine which really made me feel welcomed to the home buying process as an official homeowner. The little touches set it over the top. Any questions I had were answered that day. This was my first home purchase and I’m very appreciative for Bryan and his team. If you are considering purchasing a home please make sure you give Bryan a call. You won’t regret it.<//text>

Bryan was very professional and outstanding during the whole process.  We were a little apprehensive since this was our first home but Bryan was very understanding and knowledgeable and helped us all through closing. He provided a seamless e-signing process from document requests, through document processing, to approval. He kept us informed of current rate changes and we were able to lock in a great rate. We highly recommend him.<//Review>

Bryan made our home buying experience feel personal. He made us feel very important and was always available for our questions. We were buying our first home, and he made the process seamless. He was great at communicating with both us and our real estate agent. We cannot recommend Bryan enough!< /review>

David Bertschi has done several loans for us over the years for both purchases and home refinance. He has always been very knowledgeable and professional which removes all stress in doing a loan. He is quick to answer phone calls, texts, or emails. He is the only one I would ever recommend due not only his knowledge but the ease at which the process is handled. If you are looking for a loan in his market I highly recommend him!</review>

<Text>Kevin was great. Worked wicked hard to get our closing done as quickly as humanly possible so we could get out of the hotel we were living out of. Excellent communication skills as he kept us informed throughout the whole process. We have purchased 3 houses and worked with 3 different mortgage lenders and this was by far the easiest, fastest, smoothest, and best of all least stressful process we've ever been through. Kevin and his team are fantastic!< /Text>< Pics>

We were very impressed with Mr. Glen Smart, who helped us get our 2 home mortgage loans consolidated into one.  He was professional, courteous, thorough in his knowledge of the business and how best to help us.  In addition, he was  always available to answer questions, or be willing to work with us and our limited timeline for seeing this loan process completed.  We would highly recommend him to anyone seeking help with their home mortgage loans.<//Text>

We have been working with Guy for over 15 years. He has helped us refinance to put an addition on our house. Everytime we refinanced it was an easy process. Guy is really good at laying out all the information that is easily understood. We have recommended friends and family to Guy and they have the same great experience.

Karissa Espinosa should be your go-to professional for a home loan or refi. She was amazing to work with and made the whole process easy and fast. What more can you want? Highly recommended.< /Review>

The experience, preparation and personal touch of the Crome Team is what truly sets them apart. They always practiced proactive communication and their use of Floify technology made the process buttery smooth. This experience has truly demystified home buying for me and I would recommend this company to anyone looking to buy a home or refinance.< /Review>

I have worked with Christine Farrington on multiple deals, and she has always done a stellar job.  My last deal required a very fast turn around, and it simply wouldn't have been possible for the average mortgage broker to pull off. She did an exceptional job, and my family and I are very grateful.  Thank you, Christine!< /Review>

As this was my first time buying a home, Bay Equity went the extra mile on making sure I understood everything by communicating w/ me by email, texts or by phone rather it was at day or night time seven days a week. I'm actually thankful that they took me as their client and they were patient with me every step of the way. This is why I think these guys are great and if I know anyone else looking for a house, I will most likely recommend Bay Equity. This is an experience I will not forget. I still can't believe I bought a house. I did it!< /Text>

After shopping around comparing rates/costs, going with the timely and detailed estimate Autumn provided was our best option. Autumn and Janice were on the ball from start to finish, and were able to get us closed in only a few short weeks. Final rates and closing costs were just as projected and communication was excellent through every step. I literally could not be happier with my choice to use Autumn!</Text>

We highly recommend Janice Lake and her support team at Bay Equity.  They made the loan process easy and stress-free and they had everything completed far ahead of schedule.  They were always available to answer our questions and to get us to the next step.  We will recommend Janice to friends and family and anyone looking for a professional, accommodating, and knowledgeable loan officer.  We couldn’t have asked for a better experience.</Text>

Nora Smith was the most friendly, and helpful loan officer I have ever dealt with.  She made my refinance quick, easy and painless.  Not only was she always available to answer questions, she also pushed and got my loan closed faster than I thought possible.  I definitely recommend Nora!< /Text>

<Review>There isn't much else to say except that Mona (and her team) are simply amazing. I've purchased multiple homes through Mona and I am so grateful to have her as a resource. She really listens to a situation and always finds an answer. I find myself going to her for things non-mortgage related because she has such a large network of truly outstanding professionals that are good at what they do and are honest and fair. I will never use anyone else as long as Mona is in business!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My loan officer is Amabda Rebensky, she exceeds five stars, she's truly one in a million!! She walked me through the entire home buying experience and was there for me with any and all questions, even in the late evening and weekends. 1st time Home buying was a challenge, but with Amanda's support, God's favor, I made it through. Thank you Amanda for everything, you are amazing!!<//Text>< resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Julio was very responsive to my questions and inquiries. This was my first home purchase, and through the VA, and was nervous and stressed out, especially the closing costs. It all worked out with Julio's help, went to Closing on January 8, 2019 and now the proud owner of my own home, NO MORE RENTING!! Oh, and even got a refund back!! How cool is that?</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>April supported me in purchasing my first home, gave me excellent advice and was responsive to all my questions and concerns. April and her team have great communication and I never felt alone during what most people consider a stressful undertaking.

We had an amazing experience using Michelle Hindman and I would recommend her to anyone.   She was very knowledgeable and was quite responsive to all of my questions I was willing to go above and beyond to make sure that we got the lowest interest rate possible< /review>

<Text>Dannielle Davidson is absolutely the BEST!  Truly personalized service.  There is no way to rate her highly enough.  She goes above and beyond and is always there for you!  This is our 2nd loan through her and Bay Equity LLC.  This most recent transaction was a very difficult, complicated process because of what we were trying to accomplish.  She stuck with us through the entire thing, never gave up on our dream, went to bat for us over and over again, and helped us accomplish our dream!  THANK YOU! Is not a strong enough phrase!<//Text>< Pictures>

I’m new to the area, saw 4.9 stars and was super excited to eat here. Almost no cooked food menu, $18.00 Mixed tempura... sure, why not? Oops, that wasn’t worth $8.00. Miso was typical, $3.00 bowl of rice that tasted like cardboard, but had a decent consistency. Sushi was typical, not great, but fine. $8.00 for a Japanese Scallop that was the best thing I tried, but not good enough to order again. The finishing touch was a salmon skin hand roll that wasn’t crispy and the salmon skin was cold. I assume this was cooked in advance and put in the countertop cooling system. The place was pretty busy and most appeared to be known to the waitress. Waitress was nice, sweet and works very efficiently. I spent $71.00 trying different things by myself and I have to say my wife was the lucky one because she stayed home.</Text>

<text>We have been coming here for many years. There's new management for a year now, I think. Food is always great. The service is always great. It is definitely a family restaurant.  The owner was kind enough to give my kids some dough to play with since we have a 5 year old and we were waiting for our food. The meatballs,chicken fettucini,pizzas and strombolis are awesome!</text><userid>108138202766045557462< /userid>< Date>

Had been recommended this place from a family member and decided to check it out. Ordered and was told a 20-25minute wait. About 25/30minutes into the wait someone (I assumed a manager) came out and was talking to another person about the fact they ran out Alfredo and had to make more. No one talked to us about this even though we had Alfredo in our order as well. Waited almost an hour, first time we asked about our order we were told 5minutes more.... it was a good 15 before we got food. When we finally got the order I told the employee it would have been nice if someone had taken the time to tell us why it was taking so long. He shrugged and said there was nothing he could do about it. I told him that he could have come to let us know what was going on and as I was trying to talked to him he turned his back on me and walked into another room. When I called him out on the fact he’s walking away from me while I’m trying to talk to him he said to stop yelling at him (I never once raised my voice). I asked for the manager and someone else came out who said he was the supervisor on duty. I told him what happened and even he agreed he never heard me raise my voice. He was apologetic but not super concerned. When we ordered the menu said pasta came with soup or salad and bread sticks, you could upgrade to garlic bread for an additional charge. We ordered two pasta dishes and upgraded one. We got the garlic bread but did not receive the breadsticks or soup or salad. The food was ok and I probably would have been willing to give them another chance except that the employee was so incredibly rude that I never want to deal with them again.< /Text>

<Text>Best lobster roll value I've had in L.A. or Bay Area. Less than $20 gets you an enormous amount of fresh, juicy lobster meat on a large toasted bun. Only enough mayo to bind the lobster pieces together. Other places give you small rolls loaded with mayo and not a lot of lobster meat, for the same money. The lobster roll here is big enough for two people.< /Text><date>1571896782058<//date>< Pics>

Very disappointed! Second time here, first time dined in and waited a very long time for a dinner salad. The restaurant wasn’t busy, still took 30 minutes to get the salad. Service wasn’t great either. Last night came in and placed an order to go. The calamari was hard and cold looked like it had freezer burn. The salad was not fresh at all, the tomatoes had a white color on them, mushrooms looked old.  Needless to say the meal was a waste and thrown away.  Disappointed and won’t go back. Sad little restaurant.< /review>

One of the best pizza spots I've ever been to in regards to taste vs. cost, and they also offer many other authentic Italian foods. Great dinner spot!</Text>

Emperor Norton Italian is not an elegant restaurant but a great place for casual dinning. The Pizza and Eggplant Parmesan are excellent. Although not Italian, the cheese steak sandwich is another GREAT choice. The place changed owners a couple of years ago and the new owner Todd is making the place his own. There is now much needed Wifi and a huge TV in the back room that is really well suited for business or a large party gathering. I read a couple of reviews saying the service was slow but that was not our recent experience. Todd is making some positive changes here and we'll be back. Enjoy!<//review>

We ordered the combo pizza with sausage, pepperoni and some veggies. Crust came out nice and crisp and they didn't skimp on the toppings! Sausage pieces were good with a bit of a kick. Also, ordered several pitchers of beer. A blonde and Samuel Adams. Samuel Adams was the clear favorite of the group. We were a big enough group to have our own room so we really enjoyed the space, food and company!< /Text>

Also, it took 1/2 hour to get two  half sandwiches which were specials. Heaven only knows how long another lunch would gave taken. No complaint on food.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Pizza is delicious. Love the crust. I Always get the chicken parmigiana sandwich, it comes with fries. The side salad is delicious, great lettuce served cold with red onions and the little extras.< /review>

< review>
We came in for lunch with about 10 people. The restaurant was empty. They flipped out because we had 10 people and they require groups over 8 to make a reservation. Again, the restaurant was empty and remained that way the entire time we were there. We received absolutely no service even though there were 4 people working. We had to consistently call them to bring silverware, napkins, and water; they never came back to check on the food. When the food arrived I was shocked by the small portions. You basically get a half plate although you are paying for full plate price. This restaurant is an absolute bust. The food was good, but everything else was terrible. I would avoid this restaurant like the plague.</review>

Who knew that a simple Birthday lunch with 6 co-workers would turn into the lunch from HELL.
It started by us asking for separate checks. That ticked the waitress, Renee, off. She was adamant it could not be done. We informed her most of us did not have cash and would need the check separated later. She then said she would "try."
We gave her our orders.  We were waiting for our drinks and salads, when other customers had come in after our group and were served drinks, salads, entrees, before us.
Renee (the waitress), told one person in our group that we should have gone next door (to another restaurant). (We should have.)
Our orders came and were incorrect.
I ordered a small Cesar Salad and Cheese Bread.  Renee brought bread sticks to the table and I asked if this was the cheese bread. She said they were one in the same (not according to the menu).  I received said Cheese Bread after the checks were given to us. "I have lost my appetite,  please take back and remove from my check".
One person had a chicken Cesar salad and was charged and extra $5.00 for the chicken (which was originally included on the CHICKEN CESAR SALAD for a mere $13.00). Needless to say that check was over $27 (it was eventually corrected). Oh, BTW, when this persons check was corrected, Renee, thru the little receipt at her. (smh)
There were other error, but you get the gist.
When we received our checks Renee had taken it upon herself to add the gratuity to the bills. Crazy.
A birthday lunch we will not forget. It is a good thing the rest of the group had a meeting or there would have been 6 more at the table (we would have not asked for separate checks then). And can you imagine if she had to wait on a table for 12?
I hope Renee, finds her niche, being a waitress is not for her.
My salad wad good. I will not be back. TRY THE RESTAURANT NEXT DOOR. THE WAITRESS, RENEE, HIGHLY RECOMMENDS IT.
Good Luck to all.

******REPLY TO OWNER*****
You are correct we never once complained about the food.  However, we do need to clear one thing up. NOT ONE OF US stiffed you on the checks. 4 of us paid in cash.  Please look at your "Surveillance Camera again."  Notice that we are counting our cash to make sure we have the exact amount less the gratuity that was added.
1 person went to the register with her CASH and she was given change in the check book. She removed her change and left the book on the table. That would be the only one that may have been empty.
One book was left open due to the change on top, we did not want the person picking it up to drop the coins on the floor.
I could go on. But what is the point. We know we paid and what happened.
I wish you the best with your restaurant.</Review>

{'time': 1535059997051, 'text': "Teri,\nI am terribly sorry that you and your group had this experience!  We always strive to provide the best food and service possible, and it sounds like we did not do that for your group on this visit. This is especially surpsing to me given that your server was Renee - she has been my main lunchtime server for almost two years (with other serving experience prior), and I have never recieved a complaint about her.  She knows our regular's names, orders, and dietary preferences; is super-reliable and professional; and rarely gets orders wrong or gets flustered.  I have spoken with her, and my other server Justin (who stepped in to help your table), to review these mistakes so we can eliminate them and do better in the future.\n\nI do want to address the reason you waited for your food: the table you saw come in after you but get served first was because they called in a pre-order so the food would be ready soon after they arrived.  Also, we had an unexpected party of 15 come in, they were in the banquet room, and their food was ordered and being cooked before yours, so that slowed down your order a bit.\n\nWhile it does sound like there were a few small errors, Renee did address them promptly and correctly.  When the cheese bread did not come out with the salad, she went to the kitchen and had it rushed - according to my kitchen staff and security cameras it was ready in about 4 minutes, and it was brought to the table while you were still eating (not after the checks were given as you claimed).  She removed the additional chicken charge from the bill (an honest oversight as we recently updated our menu and computer system).\n\nIt's not Renee's fault that our policy is not to do more than 2 split checks - and many other restaurants that I know of have enacted similar policies.  [The businees reasons are simple - each swipe of a credit or debit card costs us about $0.50 (this is why the Calco and Arco gas stations charge you 40 cents to use a debit card), plus the additional work and time and effort to do so. So splitting a check 6 ways takes my server 5 minutes and costs me $3.00 instead of 50 cents and 1 minute.  In the era of slim profit margins every cost matters, and I'd rather have my server spending 5 minutes on taking care of his/her tables rather than standing at the credit card terminal and computer system.  Plus now it is easy to send other people money if you dont have cash - Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, PopMoney, Google Wallet, Apple Pay, etc. are all free and nearly instant.]\n\nThe comment about eating at the Mexican restaurant instead was inappropriate, and she apologized to me for saying that, and I'm passing on the apology to you.  However wrong that was, context is important, and she said she heard a debate at the beginning that two of your group wanted to go to El Amigo and not here; then during the lunch when a mistake was made, she heard someone in your group flippantly say maybe we should have gone to the Mexican place instead, and then Renee (again, inappropriately) snapped and said that in sarcastic agreement.  It just wasn't out of the blue that she came up with that.\n\nFinally, but very disturbing to me, is the fact that some in your group left without paying their bill (which Renee did split 6 ways at the end to try and make peace).  Three of the 6 bills were paid (2 credit cards and one cash), but the other three guest books were empty.  I audited all our records and looked at the cameras, and it is fairly obvious they were not paid.  It is one thing to not tip a server because of poor service (I completely understand this), but to walk out without paying is stealing from me.  There were no complaints about the food and the food was eaten completely, so the bills should have been paid and no tip left, if that's how you felt about the service.\n\nI'm sorry the birthday lunch did not go well, and it honestly sounds like a lot of little things snowballed into a big deal, and made for an awful experience."}</Response>

first time I tried this place was dine in for lunch and they would not accept a $100 bill because they could not break it, they did not have change. we were the only ones dining at the time and they did just open, but still, how does a restaurant not have cash? everything took forever, even just to get our drinks. the food was mediocre and the service was even worse.
I believe in second chances, so a few months later I tried them for dinner. I ordered to go this time to avoid any server delays and negligence. I was told 25 minutes for 2 pizzas, 1 appetizer, and 1 soup. I went to pick up my order after 30 minutes and was told the current wait is 45 minutes. but I phoned my order in 30 minutes ago and was told it would only be 25 minutes. I asked why did I have to wait longer than promised? the clueless guy up front told me it wasn't his problem and that I could just cancel my order, which I did. If I could give 0 stars I would, poor preparation, poor service, poor attitude. Skip this joint. EVEN LITTLE CESAR'S IS WAY BETTER ON ALL LEVELS.< /text>

A group of us went to share a Birthday Lunch today. We are returning customer's. Our waitress Rene didn't see to be in a friendly mood. She took our orders and it was like we were a bother to her. Our meals where not correct, bread didn't come till after meals had been severed. She finally had told us we should have went to another restaurant. i never had this kind of service before and i will not return because of this behavior.<//Review>

Disappointed.  First time there, recommended by my co workers.  They told me it would it be good.  When we got there the waitress (Rene) was rude. Took forever to bring the sodas and salad,  then brought bread for dinner dishes and the dishes where actually lunch size. but got charged for dinner size.  i got charged 5$ extra for chicken ceasar salad. (chicken was already included) and she charge me separately for the chicken.  She added gratuity to all individual orders.    I want to say the food was ok but she made it hard to enjoy the food. oh not to forget, the waitress Rene,  well she told us we should have gone to the Mexican restaurant instead. what is that about?</Text>

Ordered a medium pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza an order of spaghetti with meat sauce and a side of meatballs. When I picked up my order I noticed the bottom of the box was kind of damp. I figured it was because the pizza was hot. By the time I got home my pizza was so soggy. The only crispy part was the end crust. It was also very salty along with the meatball and spaghetti sauce. Very dissappointed and probably won’t be ordering from there again.</review>

<Text>Unfortunate that I have to give Emperor Norton's a one star rating but in this case it deserves it. When you are in the business of food, especially Italian food there is a definite standard of quality to uphold. Emperor Norton's has always been one of my favorite local Italian restaurants because of the consist quality of food...BUT here's where my one star review comes in: my sister ordered door dash and surprised me with minestrone soup. As soon as I opened the container I knew it was not minestrone, I'm not Italian but I know minestrone soup...potatoes, soggy over cooked spinach, carrots and a random pinto bean (frijole) or two? I know there are regional versions of minestrone, I'll accept that but this soup was very blan, clear broth not tomato based at all.
Come to find out that her order was incorrect as well. Door dash is quite expensive so not to get what you ordered or thought you ordered is very disappointing!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I ordered 1/2 Bummers and 1/2 vege- no peppers (on vege added artichoke, mushrooms and Jalapeño). Once I got home found the whole pizza to be Bummers with Peppers all over it.  I don’t eat meat so this was a huge disappointment.  Nowhere to be found any vegetarian ingredients. My husband wanted some clam chowder and stated it was so bland, tasted like watered down canned soup.  While I waited was also a disappointment to find what I think the new owners are sipping wine with a gentleman trying to sell it to them.  A customer walked in and the man who I think was one of the owners ignored him as he continued to drink his wine. I will not return- it’s not just me but have heard similar mishaps from neighbors.<//Text>< Pics>

In all seriousness, if I'd rather be eating at an Olive Garden than your Italian restaurant, something is very wrong. We will not be coming back as we didn't enjoy our visit.  Room felt dingy and dated. We went on a Saturday night, and there were only 2 other families there, red flag! The waiter was unobservant, forgetful, or inexperienced. Everytime we needed something, we had to ask. We had to take flatware from an empty table. Two people at the table had iced tea, we had to ask for refills, and they only brought one glass. Although the restaurant was not busy, our food took a really long time to arrive and was very disappointing. The salad was drenched in dressing and had rotten leaves.  Our pasta arrived lukewarm, very overcooked, and tasted like the water wasn't salted. They forgot my husband's meatball. The meat sauce had no flavor and was very watery. The "french bread" seemed more like a store bought and dry herb focaccia. Portions were enough to get full on, but didn't feel like it was enough to justify the price. Bill for 4 entrées and 2 iced teas was over 70 dollars, expensive for a few meals thrown together without care that only would have cost a fraction at home for me to make. At least I know how to time pasta correctly.< /text>

The Cheesecake was able to stand alone without the help of toppings and the Tiramasu had a good balanced flavor not being too heavy on the  coffee.< /review>< Pictures>

I had booked a Purifying Facial with Shane and was so happy with how thorough he was with every step of the facial. I told him my concerns about recent breakouts that I've been experiencing and he catered the facial to my needs-- using the appropriate products and technology to help clear the breakouts, as well as help the healing process. The environment is lovey, very calming and luxurious. I'll definitely be back!< /Review>

The salon itself is located on a lower level of the iconic Sunset Tower Hotel. It’s a bright, cozy spot with adorable pink seating and white decor. I ended up getting the Triple Crown Facial, which is Joanna’s signature. It utilizes microcurrent, as well as microdermabrasion and an oxygen infused therapy.

Sora, my facial esthetician, was so lovely and had really amazing skin. She led me to a beautiful open room with luxe bathroom amenities and an esthetician station, with soft music playing in the background. While beginning the facial she spoke with me about my skin and the different products I used. Even though I’ve previously only had one facial I could tell this was very different. All of the products used felt incredible on my skin and were clearly very high quality. As I’d never had microcurrent or microdermabrasion done I was expecting them to sting or feel slightly abrasive, but that wasn’t the case at all. Every part of the process felt gentle and relaxing. The most pleasant part of the experience in fact was the oxygen infused therapy. It felt like a delicate blow of air on my face, similar to what I imagine getting airbrushed would be like. Finally, the facial was finished by applying a healthy layer of hydration to my face and lips. Immediately after looking in the mirror afterwards I noticed the difference, and WOW. Not only was my face visibly firm and toned, but it felt incredibly firm to the touch. My skin was also much brighter and I had a serious glow, my previously dull skin even in the eye contour was completely gone. I cannot remember the last time I looked so depuffed and fresh faced. Even now days later my skin looks hydrated, healthy and firm.

My massage was with Mohammad the resident masseuse at Joanna Vargas. He was very kind and thoughtfully asked me about any sensitivities or problem areas I might have. The massage room was everything you want it to be; dark, inviting and relaxing.First, let me say that he has hands that are truly magical. An esthetician there recommended I see him because he was considered more of a healer than masseuse among clients, and I completely agree. He gave me a very deep tissue massage that worked out many knots but was also still incredibly relaxing. While I’ve had many massages before he has a very different style that is completely seamless. At every moment he is working on you, unlike many other massages I’ve had before, and he never took a break for more lotion. For someone who can find it hard to relax in the moment this was incredibly important to me. He clearly also knows how to read someone’s body because each time mine would flex or tense up he instantly changed his pressure or style, knowing. It was by far the most thorough massage I’ve had in my life.

For anyone in the L.A. area I highly recommend you check out this amazing salon! Sora is so sweet and will give you the best skin of your life, and Mohammad is incredibly gifted at reading his clients so if you’re looking for a true custom massage, this is it!</Review>< time>

<Review>The best Thai massage EVER! Fah, my massage therapist, not only focused on areas I asked for but she also gave more attention to the areas I didn't know but should be focused on (like my right knee needed more attention and she was right!). My sister, who had her first Thai massage here, also really liked her massage by May, another massage therapist. It is somewhat odd to find this place right in the center of the tourist area and next to Marriott, but they provide great Thai massage and now I am even thinking about joining their membership program.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I've had two Thai massages here recently and they were both great. Friendly atmosphere, good attention to detail, and decent prices. Their entire setup is clean and from what I understand from other reviewers some rooms can be noisy. I've been in the rooms on the Columbus st. side twice and this has not been the case.</Text>< pictures>

My boyfriend and I made appointments for regular Thai massages at Royal Thai Spa around New Years' weekend.  We did not realize that not only were we not able to use the 20% off discount for first time customers, the massages were also more expensive.  So it was $89 for a 60-minute massage.  Bummer.<//text>

< Review>
I recieved radio frequency treatment today by  robin.The interior, the atmosphere everything is so perfect and smells great! Feeling little splurged here! Han was really helpful, offering me drink, and kindly explained about the treatments and products.

The treatments are done upstairs in a private room with a bathroom.The room is decorated very tastefully, and the music is so nice too. They have all the little stuff ready for you at the restroom staring from adorable little gown to comfy slippers. .  During the treatment, she had very gentle touch, and  very kind answering all my questions. I almost fell asleep receiving the treatment because it was so relaxing..
She was constantly checking up on the tempreture, explaining the effects of the treatment. It was so helpful. Also, the oxygen treatment afterwards helped alot with soothing the face. I usually get really red and stay red for the whole day after the radio frequency treatments but aftwr oxygen treatment, the redness went down in matter of minutes

The product they put on afterwards was very gentle on skin and smelled so good. The lip balm was the best!! They told me everything is organic and natral. Which we all love😻

I had wonderful time today thanks to you all<//Review>

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Joanna Vargas! I got the Triple Crown Facial and my esthetician was Brenda.
I felt extremely relaxed and well taken care of the whole time. Brenda was really great at explaining to me everything she was doing. She even showed me my face half way through the micro current treatment so i could compare one side to the other. There was a noticeable difference! The side that had had the micro current was definitely tighter and less puffy/saggy. I’ve never had that treatment before and I loved the results. I love how all the Joanna Vargas products used in the facial are thoughtfully created so as to be all natural and cruelty free. The facial also included microdermabrasion and oxygen therapy. I was really happy with the way my face looked and felt afterward, all the dead skin was gone and it felt so fresh and smooth and moisturized, especially since my skin usually runs dry. Brenda was even willing to give me some very helpful tips on how to approach my face routine at home based on my skin. highly recommend!<//Review>

I felt like a celebrity from the moment that I walked in.   It's located in a discreet townhouse off of Beverly.  It is so beautiful inside and smelled delicious!   I was made to feel special as soon as I walked in. I was greeted by Laura and she was AMAZING!  So thorough and she knows what she is doing!    I tried the Forever Facial which is known to tighten and tone with a  combination of radio frequency and controlled heat that re-energizes collagen cells to tighten, tone, and sculpt on contact. I liked that this is a non-invasive treatment for instant lift, skin becomes more resilient, radiant, and youthful.  I could see a difference right away after the treatment. They recommend doing a series for best results.  My friends even commented on my skin and said I looked amazing!  I am looking forward to my next treatment! Thank you so much Laura!  You have the magic touch!!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Worth it and I drove all the way from Orange County!

My skin was less dry due to the cold weather we were having an I recommend to buy  the serum afterwards.   I’ve been using it every night and it’s help my dry skin on my chin to stay nice and soft.

BEST MASSAGE EVER! I came in after sleeping poorly on a long flight and Miriam totally relieved all the tension in my neck and shoulders. I also have long standing nerve injuries from a car accident that I didn't even think were possible to address with a massage- but I was wrong! I was so impressed when she told me that she previously worked as the masseuse of the Carolina Panthers but it made sense because she was so precise and knowledgable about anatomy. Truly an NFL quality massage!!!!! Could not recommend her more. The spa its self was gorgeous, clean, cozy and located in the most beautiful hotel in Los Angeles. The manager and staff were so welcoming and accommodating.  I would go anywhere for this massage but it definitely didn't hurt to feel like I was on vacation in a luxury hotel for the day.< /Review>

I Just got the best facial by Asia at Joanna Vargas day spa in LA!!! To begin, the space is so beautiful, clean and peaceful. They were so sweet with helping me find the location and giving me a parking pass when I arrived. I was immediately offered tea or water as I walked in. Asia greeted me warmly and made me feel very welcome and comfortable the whole time. With 12 years of experience, she was extremely knowledgeable, and informed me of the process and the benefits I was receiving every step of the way. Any questions I had, she eloquently answered. She identified my skin type and informed me of ways to care for my skin including her recommendations and what my expectations were for the service I was receiving. I got the Triple Crown Facial and an LED light therapy treatment. I have sensitive skin so she addressed my sensitivity with a light peel, and a Joanna Vargas mask to help repair my epidermis. We did an oxygen treatment at the end which felt AMAZING!! Her touch was just right and I left with my skin glowing and feeling ultra hydrated. I most definitely got the result I was looking for and an incredible service. This was such a wonderful and relaxing experience and I can't wait to return! Thank you again Asia, and everyone at Joanna Vargas!!!</Text>

This was truly a treat! I had my facial today with Robin and all I can say is, "WOW!" The salon is absolute beautiful and welcoming. Upon walking in, the ladies there greet you and make you feel right at home. I instantly felt calm and relaxed as I was whisked away upstairs to slip into my lovely white robe and begin my facial. The music was on point and Robin took such great care in explaining what she would be doing from start to finish. The products and their scents of citrus and deliciousness were heavenly and I cannot wait to get my hands on their skin care line.  Immediately after my treatment, my skin looked fresh, smooth and radiant! I cannot recommend Joanna Vargas' Salon enough! Everyone must experience this invigorating treatment!!< /text>

From her delicate touch to the thorough step by step guidance and knowledge of the Signature Triple Crown Facial, I was totally immersed and transformed into a blissful experience that left my skin extremely cleansed, hydrated and dewy for many days after.

<text>WOW! I came in today for a facial with Asia at the LA location of the Joanna Vargas Salon and it was by far the best facial experience EVER.

To start the location was so gorgeous. The layout of the space, the decorations, the rose gold accents, the artwork, the goodie bags, everything was intelligently placed and beautiful. Right away I was offered tea or water, and filled out a brief sheet on my expectations for the facial and basic health history.

The actual facial experience was amazing too. They start off by having you change into a robe and slippers and get comfortable on the bed. I chose to get the Oxygen Purifying Facial. I typically HATE extractions but Asia made it comfortable the entire time and would check in on me to make sure I wasn't in any pain. Throughout the facial I had a lot of questions and Asia answered them every step of the way. She is full of knowledge about skin and well informed on every service the Johanna Vargas salon offers. After extractions and a masque they used the oxygen machine on me which feels like HEAVEN. They airbrush a serum on your face (which smells delicious) and then use the oxygen machine to push the serum into deeper layers of the skin. I've never had that done before and I was blown away. For a final touch she applied some type of moisturizer with a little lip balm which was the perfect ending to my experience.

I've already scheduled my facial for next month where I'll be getting the Triple Crown Facial with the LED light therapy treatment as well. I CANNOT WAIT.

Thank you Asia for such an amazing facial experience. I can't say enough great things about your professionalism, talent, and knowledge.< /text><Response>{'time': 1479876305363, 'text': 'Glen, you blew us away with your detail and precise detail of our customer service and treatment. Our oxygen facial was developed by Joanna Vargas to be one of the staples of the salon. This includes the Joanna Vargas Oxygen Serum. We will let Asia know about the praise and we look forward to seeing you on your next visit.'}<//Response>< userid>

Very impressed with the new location in LA. I saw Asia at the New York Salon and was happy to find out she is now in LA when I was visiting cause she’s incredible and the best esthetician I know. Really knowledgeable and took the time to explain every detail. The facials are amazing and their customer service goes well beyond expectations. Definitely worth it and highly recommend.</review>

The staff at the Joanna Vargas Subset Tower spa are welcoming and in total care to my skin care needs. The space was clean, private and calming for living in a hectic Los Angeles life. I had the triple crown facial which was by far the best facial I’ve ever had. As a makeup artist and beauty editor I highly recommend the JVS team and the facials to all.<//review>

<text>I went to Joanna Vargas​ for a facial but was pleasantly surprised to find out​ that they offered massages at this location. I've​ been needing a massage​, so I decided to ​reschedule the facial for another day.  Mohammad did my deep tissue massage and it was AMAZING. He paid close attention​ to the areas that I mentioned were problems and glid over the areas that I specified on the intake form to avoid. Side notes: try the ginger tea and if you ask for the massage to be deep, prepared​ yourself, because it gets​ DEEP!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<user_id>114940332638802278182</user_id><Time>1521086457421</Time><Review>Asia is the best esthetician imaginable. She has completely transformed my skin in just a month. I came in with tons of irritation and hormonal breakouts on my face. After a couple months struggling, I did a ton of research and found the Joanna Vargas Salon. All the reviews I saw were positive and I liked that they focused on using natural remedies to heal the skin rather than invasive and harsh treatments. When I arrived, Asia's sweet and calming demeanor helped me to feel at ease. I'm going to continue to see her every month because it has made all the difference and has been such a relaxing and enjoyable experience. I cannot recommend her enough! I'm so incredibly grateful for all her help and that my skin is finally clearing up.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Amazing facial!!!!!!! I get such bad acne and am always apprehensive to get facials as they irritate my skin. So glad I decided to come in! I had the triple crown facial and my face is literally glowing and has calmed down considerably. The Sunset Tower is such a beautiful location as well, I feel like I went on vacation and returned with a new improved face. Asia was so sweet and knowledgeable, I felt like I could trust her with my extra sensitive skin. Would definitely recommend!!!!</text>

I have been seeing Asia at JV salon in LA for over 6 months and my skin is incredible. Asia is calm, nurturing and so attentive, she nurtured my skin back to itself after a very stressful time. The facials are calming and healing, taking on a very organic and natural approach to healing. My skin has never felt so good - I would highly recommend the salon.<//Review>

I saw Sue for a deep cleansing facial and am amazed with the results.  I went in with pimples and cystic acne on my face and along my jaw line.  I've been wearing more foundation because I've been self conscious about my breakouts but it's also making me breakout even more! Oh the viscous cycle!

Sue did her best to unclog my pores and remove the blackheads from my face with a suction .  The steam from the towels on my face felt so nice.  I also got an LED light treatment.  I'm sure there are other treatments she performed that I can't remember.

The whole experience was very relaxing.  I think I actually dozed off a little during my treatment.  I left with my skin feeling refreshed and clean.  It's been 3 days since my facial and I can honestly say my acne did shrink (not totally gone yet but hopefully soon!)  Sue was nice and easy to talk to during my facial.  I highly recommend her!

Parking tip: Park in the residential neighborhood on Delongpre and Flores and walk up the white stairway to the Sunset Tower Hotel.< /Text>

I have heard wonderful things about Joanna Vagas's spa and decided to try their signature triple crown facial. After a consultation with Whitney, we decided the Oxygen purifying facial would be the best course of action for my skin type. She also recommended that I use their LED light bed afterwards to boost my collogen and repair sun damage. My skin feels amazing and I can't wait to come back to maintain clear healthy skin.< /Text>

The facial I had at the Joana Vargas spa exceeded my expectations!

The room was luxurious with the subtle pink walls, great decorating and soothing music.

The actual facial I got from Asia (who is the best) was better than Botox. She used radio frequency and intense moisture therapies to make me feel like a glowing star that day and for the whole week.

Obsessed with the Joana Vargas daily serum, it has great benefits and does not feel too heavy for my oily skin.

Will definitely be back for more treatments!</text>< Pics>

I have found my skincare soulmate in Joanna Vargas' amazing aesthetician- Anastasia. Having expressed a few concerns regarding sun damage & acne from excessive summer travel, Anastasia began working on my skin with the triple crown facial, making the most of our time together by walking me through the treatment process and assessing where my at home skincare routine could improve. Her sense of humor and gorgeous, glowing skin made me feel so comfortable that any and all wisdom she imparted regarding my epidermis should be given my full attention.

What I especially appreciated following my facial was how Anastasia suggested the perfect products to fill out my at home routine without a feeling of pressure. Even more amazingly, she followed up in a personal email with instructions for the JV eye cream, JV rejuvenating serum, and MD Solar SPF Tinted Moisturizer I purchase. I so appreciated the gesture, as this allowed me to float effortlessly out of the salon post facial in full bliss. The products are working amazingly and I can already see my skin changing. Never in my life have I experienced such care and attention to detail in conjunction with suggestions for new, improved wellness routines ... in any medical field for that matter. I would highly recommend Joanna Vargas salon and do suggest booking with Anastasia as far in advance as one's schedule permits.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I recently got a facial by Asia at the Los Angeles salon and it was the best facial and experience I've had at a salon.  The ambiance of the salon was very soothing, comfortable, and relaxing.  I was greeted by Han and Asia and they both made me feel very welcomed.  Before we started, I discussed with Asia my main goal was to lighten up my acne scarring.  I’ve tried many different treatments to lighten them up but I haven’t had any luck.  She looked over my skin and recommended that I get the purifying facial and vitalight facial.  I’m so happy I went with her recommendations because after the facial my skin was glowing.  I actually met up with some friends after and they complimented me on how clear my skin looked.  I told them what a great experience I had, and now they plan on getting their next facial done with Asia.   I could not be happier to have worked with Asia, she was super sweet and very knowledgeable about skin care. I can’t wait until my next visit! Thanks again Asia!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I had the pleasure of receiving a mothers day gift of a  red carpet facial treatment from Tesia.   I'm typically kind of an "outdoorsy" persona and don't focus on myself nearly enough.  Tesia was amazing!  She is very professional and has a gentle relaxing intuitive touch during all steps of the procedure.  She also explains each treatment step clearly in a soothing voice adding to the relaxation experience.  I could feel facial firmness, skin smoothness and brightness immediately.  The custom designed products also are gentle, fragrant and natural feeling.  All of the staff members at the Spa are friendly, professional, and create an environment where you can truly unplug and concentrate on self care.  I would highly recommend Tesia and the other very capable staff members.< /text>

<username>Samantha Peters</username><Review>I saw Sora for the most incredible facial! She is extremely knowledgeable and was great at recommending what was best for my skin. I saw immediate results. My skin was noticeably smoother when I left and continued to improve and clear up over the next couple days. I would highly recommend Joanna Vargas, and especially Sora!

I recently got a facial by Asia at the Los Angeles salon and it was the best facial and experience I've had at a salon.  The ambiance of the salon was very soothing, comfortable, and relaxing.  I was greeted by Han and Asia and they both made me feel very welcomed.  Before we started, I discussed with Asia my main goal was to lighten up my acne scarring.  I’ve tried many different treatments to lighten them up but I haven’t had any luck.  She looked over my skin and recommended that I get the purifying facial and vitalight facial.  I’m so happy I went with her recommendations because after the facial my skin was glowing.  I actually met up with some friends after and they complimented me on how clear my skin looked.  I told them what a great experience I had, and now they plan on getting their next facial done with Asia.   I could not be happier to have worked with Asia, she was super sweet and very knowledgeable about skin care. I can’t wait until my next visit! Thanks again Asia!</text>

Scheduled with Sora and she’s absolutely amazing!! Easily the best facial I’ve ever had. If you’re ever going to go in I highly suggest you book with Sora. My skin has never felt better. She understood exactly what I needed. One of the most relaxing and rejuvenating experiences I’ve ever had. The spa is beautiful and the staff is extremely nice.<//Review>

After reading about the triple crown facial on Into the gloss and hearing about this spa from friends, I went and got the facial. It was next level luxurious and lived up to the hype. The spa checked all the boxes, quality aestheticians, sweet staff, clean/private/comfortable space...the JoannaV product line is really excellent as well,  it was hard not to buy everything in the store.
Definitely valet, it's only 12$ . Finding parking on sunset blvd is an absolute nightmare.</text>

I went to Joanna Vargas salon for a massage and was lucky enough to work with Mikayla. Mikayla along with the other staff at the front desk were so warm and friendly when I first got to the salon. Mikayla genuinely cared about getting to know my concerns and where I needed the most attention. She gave me an amazing massage! I was so relaxed and felt very comfortable in her care. She really focused on the areas I asked for in my back to help me with the tension headaches I’ve been getting from the stress I carry in my shoulders. Mikayla also walked me through some of the other treatments at the salon I was interested in trying and I will definitely be back in the future to try some of their facials! Mikayla was a delight to work with and I really appreciated her calming presence and skillful massage work.< /text>

I went in for the triple crown facial. Immediately after I felt the difference on my skin. Asia, my therapist, is clearly an expert in what she does. The salon has a nice relaxing atmosphere and the staff is very friendly.< /Review>

<review>I am the head Esthetician at the Joanna Vargas Salon in Los Angeles. I started with the company in New York and have had the pleasure to come out to LA to work with some of the most amazing people I have encountered with. I believe in the philosophy of non-invasive skincare and using organic products whole heartedly. The results I have seen in my client's skin and my own skin have been remarkable. I have worked in many places all over the country and I can honestly say Joanna is the best of the best.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Book a session with Sora!

If I could give Sora 100 stars I would. Aside from being an absolute skin magician, Sora is kind, funny and very knowledgeable. She always answers my questions thoroughly and offers great advice on products and healthy skin care habits. My favorite is the Triple Crown Facial. My only regret is not having found her sooner.

The spa itself is beautiful, welcoming and relaxing. So much attention to details has gone into making this the absolute best place for a facial.</review><Response>None< /Response>< time>

Everyone from the receptionist to the facialist was warm and welcoming. I came out feeling like a new person. All the products and treatments were very gentle and not highly scented which is important to me because I have very sensitive skin. Robyn, my facialist had a very good massage technique and everything was on point. Can't wait for my next Triple Crown facial!

My esthetician, Asia Vereline knew her stuff! She was educated on the products, explained the steps while she went, but also allowed me to relax and enjoy.

I recently had a relaxing Triple Crown Facial at Joana Vargas. The aesthetician was super knowledgeable and my skin responded really well to the treatment. I loved the microdermabrasion and microcurrent, I could visually see my face was lifted by the treatment. I loved the results. The staff was kind and helpful.</review>

About a year ago, I had been a frequent guest of the Sunset Tower Hotel before moving to LA, and a friend of mine recommended I try Mohammed. Let’s just say that I won’t go anywhere else, or to anyone else.  Period.

He blends deep tissue with relaxation and I leave feeling like a new person.  His ability to address every ache and stress in my body is incredible. If I could I would give him 10 stars on this app, and will tell you that he is the best massage therapist I have ever had.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

<Text>What to say about an experience you can’t quite put in words? I have the most reactive skin and nothing ever seems to work. Today I received the Triple Crown and I have to say, it was the most relaxing and healing time. Sora (my esthetician) has the perfect touch - I always trust her judgement. My skin feels so amazing every time I leave here. This is my third time here and I have to say, everyone gets the star treatment. The staff is so incredible and it’s a luxurious laid-back feel. Again, words can’t fully describe. Thank you, Joanna Vargas team. I truly appreciate the hospitality. The PERFECT end to a busy hectic week. High recommend!</Text></record>

<review>Love, love, love Asia Vereline. She is the most talented, gentle and patient esthetician and the only person I trust with my sensitive, reactive, acne-prone skin. Luxurious, calming and most importantly, effective.
I get the Oxygen Purifying Facial with Vitalight treatment and Asia has reduced all scarring to almost nothing - even the ones from cystic acne - and kept my skin hydrated and glowing. Never pushy and always intuitive and in tune with what my skin needs, she's the best.<//review>< user>

I first visited the Joanna Vargas Salon in New York City in July 2016 for an oxygen purifying facial with Jessica. Everyone was so warm and welcoming and Jessica was so careful and meticulous as she cleansed my skin. Prior to this visit, I had never had a proper facial. I had no idea what I had been missing!! Living in California, I didn't know when I would be back in NYC. To my suprise, they let me know they were opening a location in Los Angeles, CA and I instantly knew I had to let me sister know since she lived in LA. Even though I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, I fly in and visit the Joanna Vargas Salon in Los Angeles once a month and my sister and I both get an oxygen purifying facial and 30 minutes of the Vitalight. I truly can't express how amazing Asia is! She is always so kind and does an incredible job at addressing my skin concerns. I look forward to my visit every month and know that my skin is in the best hands! I highly recommend Joanna Vargas Salon LA and wouldn't  go anywhere else for beautiful, clean, and glowing skin! Book an appointment with Asia!  I'm positive your skin will thank you!!<//Text>

I heard about Joanna Vargas in NYC and was thrilled to learn they were opening in LA! Yesterday I received the Triple Crown Facial with the VitaLight treatment. My Esthetician Asia recommend I add the light treatment for my dermatitis. I could not be more happy with the way my skin felt and looked after having this treatment. She also recommend that I do a series of the light treatments and I can already notice a difference and can't wait to go back for another facial. The space is beautiful and the products smell amazing!</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Joanna Vargas salon in Los Angeles defines the word excellence from all angles. The space is well kept & they make you feel right at home. Estetician, Asia Vereline's professionlism & knowledge of skin care is outstanding. She will walk you through & explain in expert detail every procedure, if you're curious, or she will let you take a nap and relax if that's what you're needing during your day! I was able to visit both the New York salon & Los Angeles salon and find they place so much importance on you as a client. You cannot go wrong placing your skin in Joanna Vargas Salons care.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I'm a hairstylist and have worked side by side with Estehtician's for years. I've had numerous facials from many different esti's and can honestly say Asia has by far been the best. The overall experience was incredible. From the homie atmosphere, making me feel extremely comfortable and the precise detail to my skin. They even added a foot massage to top it off. I would recommend Joanna Vargas LA to everyone. Thank you Joanna Vargas team for making me feel amazing!</Review>< Pics>

<text>I always wanted to go to Joanna Vargas skincare in New York. When she opened a salon in LA I finally got to go to the Skin Guru! The salon is beautiful and decorated perfectly. The staff is always super professional. But the real reason I drive 2 to 3 hours from Orange County to get there is Asia my Master Estitition  and Joanna's radio fregency machine! I have had fillers and Botox but there comes a time when you can't keep filling your face to keep it lifted. I read about Joanna Vargas's Magic radio frequency machine and it is magic. It is not painful at all. There is no downtime. You will probably need a series of treatments but it is so worth it! You will keep seeing better and better results with sagging jowls and neck. It is a totally natural look also because it's just restoring your face to what it used to be! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!<//text>< name>

She is by far the best aesthetician in Los Angeles. I went in because I was getting married in two weeks and wanted to look the best version of myself. My face was looking a bit sunken and dull. Throughout the facial, Asia educated me on the procedure and what was to be expected. She even took a before and after picture to see the immediate results. My face was immediately more plump, de-puffed, less wrinkles, my cheekbones were more pronounced and the muscles in my face were nice and tight with a lift! It looked like I just had a Botox lift without all the toxins! My felt face radiant and was glowing for days. The great thing about this facial is that it promotes healthier cell turn over while increasing collagen! Who wouldn't want that?

The location was top notch; serene, clean and revamped.
Asia is truly the best. Very warm, kind and professional at the same time! Can't wait to come in for my next facial!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Sora Sora Sora! Hands down, the best facial I've ever had thanks to Sora, my esthetician. I am super picky and know a good one when I see one. This girl is brilliant (and also easy on the eyes, so beautiful and sweet) with her techniques and hands. She worked magic on my skin and even upper chest where I am getting lines. I tried the NOVA, oxygen purifying facial and the infrared bed. I  walked out of there with the most amazing glow and felt like a million bucks. I've been here now two times and want to make it a monthly routine.</review>< pictures>

<name>Kelli Finn<//name><text>The BEST facial I’ve ever had!!! I got the Triple Crown Facial and I did the LED Light. My face looks younger and fresh af!!! Seriously my skin needed this. I have rosacea and very sensitive skin and the redness in my skin looked a lot less red than usual and so hydrated!! Also this spa was so beautiful and I felt like I was on cloud nine!

I will definitely be back. I can’t believe the results after just one facial! I have gone to many different spas and had many facials and this one exceeds the rest by far!!

Laura was awesome and so informative and made me feel super comfortable. She made me feel like my skin can really be fixed and it doesn’t take much.

I love these products, the Vitamin C wash, the Daily Serum, the Daily cream, the Exfoliating Mask, and the eye cream . And all of the products are very effective but don’t feel harsh on my overly sensitive skin. Also they smell sooooooo friggin good!!!

Ok I couldn’t love this place more! Thank you! ❤️< /text>< Response>

I do not know where to begin to sing my praises for the Joanna Vargas salon! I have gone to so many medspas and facialists over the years. Joanna Vargas has the BEST treatments! I am almost 60 so I love the Forever Facial which is radio frequency. It is getting me back to my old face. With fillers you start looking puffy and not like yourself. With radiofrequency you are tightening up your skin to take off the years. I am also doing the Microcurrent which is called The Triple Crown. Microcurrent is like taking your face to the gym! You do need to do a series for best results but you will see results the first time. Everyone is so professional and personable. I live in Orange County and it is worth sitting in hours of traffic there and back to get these treatments! p.s. Her products are the best also!<//review>

Like most men, my experience with salons and skin care is severely limited, long considered a realm reserved strictly for women. It is a shame that I did not venture into this world of facials earlier in life, as the results are nothing short of spectacular.

Enter Joanna Vargas, esthetician to the stars. Her signature Triple Crown Facial has opened my eyes (and pores) to the possibilities of proper skin care. I did a little research before heading over to her West Hollywood salon, just so I knew what I was getting into. The treatment called for a combo of technologies that would remove dead skin, reduce puffiness, and reshape my jawline. Sounds good to me, I could do with less puff.

Upon arrival, I was impressed with the décor of the space. Located in a quaint condo just steps off 3rd Street, the feeling is that you just stepped into a gorgeous and welcoming hotel suite. The staff makes you feel right at home, as if the entire place is your private oasis for the next hour. There was a hint of perfectionism in the air with all the accents, which instilled confidence that my treatment was going to be world class.

Asia Vereline was my guide throughout this journey, and she didn’t disappoint. With a genial bedside manner, she explained the process: Microdermabrasion to exfoliate and remove dead skin, followed by a microcurrent session that stimulates and strengthens the facial muscles, and capped off with oxygen-infused therapy.

The session was relaxing, akin to a luxurious massage, and as I my face was receiving its upgrade, I dozed off a little, succumbing to the comfortable environment. At one point, Asia pulled out a mirror so I could see the instantaneous results. It was quite clear that a difference had already been made, as the redness and puffiness were completely gone.

At the conclusion of the treatment, I spent probably too much time looking in the mirror admiring the changed complexion. What a masterpiece! My skin was certainly glowing, and my jawline was more pronounced.

So fellas, put a facial down on your Christmas wish list, and let the good folks at Joanna Vargas change your mind on what it means to have a spa day.< /Text>

I am so impressed with Jenny! My sister, mom and I came in and we were all so happy when we left. I am very picky with how I like my eyebrows to look and she definitely listened to what I want. It was our first time, she was so nice and welcoming. I will definitely be coming back soon. I encourage everyone to ask for her, if you want to leave happy!! Prices are also good!<//Review>

I am on vacation all the way from Austin, Texas. I am super particular on who touches my brows. I was on the other side of town and realized all the other shops didn’t have the best reviews. Took the trip out to El Cajon and Ms Linda did a wonderful job! Prices are great, shop is clean, and didn’t have to wait at all. Anytime I am in San Diego I will definitely be back!</review>

First time I went it was perfect Linda helped me and I love the work she did. She only trimmed and cleaned m eyebrows. Second time someone else helped me and I hated it. She didn't even take inconsideration that I had thick natural brows to begin with did let her know that only trim NOT shape. I come out wit super think browns. Know I have to wait for them to grow out and only go when Linda is there.<//Review>

<Name>Marco Marks< /Name><date>1519007452778< /date><rating>3< /rating><Review>I walked in, was not greeted, and so I just sat on the couch. After 10 minutes it was my turn (1 lady in front me, from start to finish it was 10 mins) There are usually 2 workers here on Sundays, if that helps. The ladies were nice, not very talkative. Remember, English isn't their first language. These women just aren't speakers.

The threading was honestly painful. More painful than it probably should've been. I understand that this method will have you feeling a little pain, but as a prior Marine, I can confidently say that THIS made my eyes water. I feel like they rush through the process to get customers out faster. At the end of the threading, we walk up to the counter where she gives me a loyalty card and stamps it, and despite it being in my hand, takes it back from my fingers after I tell her that I purchased the Groupon, which was $3 less than usual price. A bit ridiculous, even if that is normal procedure, a business should not take back what they've already presented and given only AFTER the fact. But hey, these little eyebrow + nail shops are a thousand dollar industry and NOT a million dollar industry for a reason.

Oh, my brows look better though. 🤣</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Literally the worst post experience ever! I went in for full face threading which I have never done before and I made that clear. I was not told there were any possibilities of my skin breaking out into a horrible rash or treated with any post Aloe or Tonic whatsoever. It wasn't even suggested to me to use an ice cube after wards  or wash my face with cool water..and I would think that for a brand new person these things would have been mentioned. I am so upset at how my face looks now. I've not had acne or pimples like this before and now my entire face is covered.</Review>< Resp>

<text>Their bbq is tasty and well priced. Their hot pot is pretty solid as well. I always order the roast duck and roast pork. It's hard to find a quality Hong Kong style BBQ place in Sonoma so I'm happy this place exists!< /text><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I just moved to this area, and I saw on nextdoor.com that a neighbor recommended the seasonal crab and decided to try it as well. I was sort of thinking that I probably can't get real Chinese food in Petaluma. I ordered the ginger scallions crab - super yum, super fresh! The crab comes in a compostable brown paper box. Other items I ordered, though, came in plastic boxes. I must remember though to ask the restaurant not to put other items in plastic containers - toxic.</text>

Delicious, kind owners, generous portions. Pretty authentic HK style, with some American style twists. Lunch plates are great value. Order some for curbside pickup and enjoy!<//text>

Its weird when you call a restaurant and they answer the phone with "hello"
I thought I must have misdialed someone's home. After I placed my order and arrived for pick up she again answered the phone with a hello?
I though again I somehow called the wrong number...
The food was good, the portions were generous, and it was fast.
It was just a weird ordering experience</Text>

I usually come in, buy char sui, roasted pork belly, or Peking duck to-go. The only place I know in the North Bay where you can buy by the pound. Excellently prepared. However, the in-house menu is amazing with lots of off-beat not-your-usual-fare selections HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. The chef here is excellent. He and the staff have always been super friendly to me. And I always buy a box of the roasted peanuts on the way out, a perfect TV snack.< /Text>

Just had lunch here today and it was delicious! We shared several dim sum plates and bought a beautiful roast duck for dinner. I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu and will for sure be trying the hot pot. So glad we finally gave this restaurant a try.</Text>

Super cheap Chinese BBQ. They are rarely busy so transactions are really quick. Solid lunch special for $11.99: two meats, veggies and rice or noodles</Text>

Authentic Hong Kong/ Cantonese food! Decent Price! The princess chicken and BBQ pork are comparable to those in Canton. Please go to south bay to open a branch, and you will definitely beat tons of so-called Chinese restaurants.<//Text>

Yesterday - Saturday (1/28/2017) - my wife and I took my elderly mother here for lunch.  We arrived about 1pm and were only people in the place until about half-way through our meal when a couple other small groups/families came in.  Ordered pot stickers, hot and sour soup and a sizzling plate dish with a mix of chicken, pork, beef, shrimp and vegetables.   Portion sizes were very generous (especially the soup) and everyone liked the flavors.  Service was also reasonably quick -- but maybe that was helped by fact we were only people there when we first arrived.   Also price seemed very reasonable.  Bill with tax came to about $30.   All in all, we will definitely be eating here again.  Maybe next time we will try the BBQ platter.<//text>

This place has unique authentic Chinese food that can't be found in any other Chinese restaurants in Sonoma County. If you want to try something different from typical American Chinese food and don't want to drive out to SF, this is the go-to place. They have authentic Hong Kong style Dried Scallop Egg White Fried Rice (my favorite) and excellently prepared Singapore Rice Noodle. If you are feeling adventurous, try their Spicy/Soya Pork Ears or Tendon (Be prepared to be Spicier than other American Chinese restaurants if you ordered Spicy), Special Ham Hock and Beef Tripe with Black Bean Sauce.  In addition, they offer authentic Cantonese Hot Pot on the second floor. It's perfect if you have a part of five or more.<//text>

I only shopped at Petco since I've moved to Santee because they didn't have it in the small towns I lived in and I really feel like their reputation is much better than other chain stores but I have to say that the one in Santee is like a house of mirrors it is crazy I feel so bad for those employees I go in and nothing ever is in the same place it is so crazy then they're ripping down walls and they're putting in vet? The STORES need some consistency with sales and keeping products together their shelves are continuously empty.I live very close to other stores but this one is like a mile away and I used to know everyone in there I don't know if new management came in and cleaned house I don't recognize a single face in there! They were excellent ! I have been rescuing dogs for 20 years so for the last 6 years I have been going in there and I really depend on those rewards it is ridiculous the system I have manager after manager call . I  had to change my phone number recently lost my points The fact the points expire you now in 29 days ! Ridiculous 🙄 I always send them there you know the employees are calling I'm calling I mean there's a line of 10 people behind me it just Santee really is a mess and it's not the employee's fault I mean they are hustling they are five or six people behind You either need to shut the store down and then have another shift that unload your deliveries because you can't even get a basket through and then to try and find an ad that you get or a deal I mean these poor people don't have time to take down a sign so you when you get up there and you see that it's buy something that's 5 oz and it's the other 5 oz is you know half price well there's only three flavors and they're all chicken you know and the rest of the bags are you know 12 oz and none of those have chicken I mean but you all you sees a giant 50% off your second bag I mean it really needs help and I'm sure if that Petco is that way then all the pet codes are that way That's the reason I don't leave that one because well I was being loyal to the employees because you know we had built a funny and fun relationship but you know again I'm never going to go to your competitor but I don't know what to do Are you really need another shift or hire more employees I don't know if it's your pay but you know I mean this whole line of CBD that's fantastic but there were things that my dog relied on a 10-year-old dog that's been using it for 6 years for digestion or ears or soap you know for shampoo or you know which is a pitbull and then my brother's dogs a pug things that she relied on . we need things to stay in the same places be reasonable priced and we need for you to have those rewards worked out I really need to be contacted because I it's it's hundreds of dollars that I've lost on this rewards why they're you know I mean I can't you know I mean if I'm buying you know food for a pitbull which is a giant one of wellness and a small core one for another small one but another white fish core of wellness and then a small breed I mean I don't necessarily fall within the 30 days and then the treat s and then the medications like I said the probiotics the ear drops you know and these things are out .He is a pitbull He is gentle all gentle but he doesn't like his nails done He's a rescue I don't know what happened you know between zero and one but I can't get anybody to answer any questions Are they going to use some of the CBD to calm him down I mean since you're pushing that so hard I don't understand why none can answer and the phone just rings and rings not a familiar face anymore I used to but it was always everybody knew me by name and we're talking again 6 years. know having this happen 30 days when you're spending you know $180 and have it disappear I mean sometimes you just don't need to go every 30 days and to have that disappear is ridiculous.</text>

They take care friendly and try solve problems. Their knowledge about job is good. Only thing l stayed more than 1 hour in the store.  They take care with one customer so long, they answer all questions, that's good but they need to check how many person waiting also. Thank you</text>

<Review>This is my new favorite Petco. I was going in there looking for guinea pig food. When their excellent worker named Ariana helped me find it while providing great attitude and even more information about guinea pigs ! She was so helpful, I even purchased a new hide for my guinea pig as well. I asked her how long she worked there, and I was amazed to hear only a month. This petco has great customer service and very useful information. 5/5 Rex commend this location , and that awesome worker.<//Review>< pics>

I feel unsafe when I enter the local petco stores. I did not see sanitizer available. The store workers did not clean surfaces prior to me touching them and checking out.</text>

< Review>
I ordered online this time and went in after receiving an email my order was ready. This store has added a Vet. So they are having some growing pains I think. In the dog section things move around & I get frustrated due to the masks!! So this was a breeze! I know they will also bring it out to your car !< /Review>

This Petco is very friendly to animals and the grooming department is fun to watch when I'm volunteering at the Kitty Devour Rescue house inside Petco.  The place is clean and now that the law took effect for rescue animals, there's always an assortment of furry paws that really need a home.  So, please, stop by and check out the rescues.</text>

Love this store, our vet is at the "Other" pet store... lets face it when comparing pet store we are really just comparing the chain brands Petco amd Petsmart... both store employees seem knowledgeable some more then others at each store, and they all care about our pet kids, but Petco has this creamy pumpkin food topper with there brand of food that my puppy loves and helps with his digestion, Petsmart has nothing resembling it, they both seem to carry the same products and brands of toys, food, beauty and houseing essentials, but petco seems to be more stalked at all times at all locations we've been too. They have never been out of anything we needed or size we needed for our puppies Thor and Freya or our mouse Inky Tot petsmart has been out often... We go to Petsmart monthly for our puppies shots and mess and try to buy our store stuff too but they don't have it... Petco always seems to have everything!!! Love this store and company and so do our pets!!!</text>

They have better prices at Petco online. The stores will match it but only if you have it pulled up on your phone already. Kind of annoying, especially since the online price is usually significantly better but their website is so slooowwww.<//review>

<Review>Petco doesn't carry Bil-Jac so I don't visit there often. The day I did go in there which was during normal business hours on the weekend was to speak with someone at Thrive about their monthly program. Unfortunately, they were not open which ended up being a deal breaker for me. I have three rescue dogs and sometimes need to book appointments on the weekends.</Review><gmapID>0x80d958001d312f8f:0x3fa0fc4a0524e2b2< /gmapID>< user_name>

< Review>
Sadly they don't appear to take very good care of the fish here. I was very upset by the state of the betta fish. The water in their cups looked as though it hasn't been changed in weeks, and several were on the verge of death. Meanwhile they were receiving a new batch of fish. If they can't keep up with the care of their current fish stock, I don't think they should be adding more. I hope this review is seen by the necessary person to make the changes needed to care for these animals in their care.</Review>

<Text>The store was easy to navigate and I found what I was looking for easily. Cashier was super friendly. This is for Petco overall: I wish you still made the petco brand harnesses with the alligator teeth closure at the neck. I purchased many and they were awesome and my chihuahuas could not slip out of them. Wish you hadn't discontinued them, they were the best.<//Text>< name>

The people who helped me were really nice/helpful and respectful of social distancing. The products are things I've purchased in the past that I loved and needed to rebuy so thank you for always keeping the animals in my life happy and healthy! 💕</text>

< review>
Update:05/24 Sunday   Came here to look at Collars. Jason of course showed me the perfect collar for my Cane Corso!  Jason showed me the differences in collars and chains. He also demo d how to Use them for me!  Ricardo checked me out and was super helpful. He took the extra step and time to update my phone number on my Petco Pals Account!  Always Exceptional Smiling Service that keeps me coming back!  Coupons are Nice too! Saved 20$!
I swear I normally go to Petco and just look in the clearance bin because I’ve always considered them expensive. But I started talking with Jason and he completely schooled me on my dog and what it needed and food and the right color and right leash and just everything that I could know about my dog Jason was so awesome. I was going to Amazon on my phone and looking for a price match but Petco had already beaten Amazons prices with their sale prices. I also spent enough to use a coupon which saved me a lot of money and I use a lot of buy two get one free. The service provided by Jason and the rest of the staff was exceptional. I had only brought so much cash in. I had to watch what I spent. The cashier was super patient and helpful. She didn’t mind making sure I had enough cash to cover the transaction.Like I said I usually go to Petco just to look at what they have and buy some thing out of the clearance bin but after seeing their prices and the specials and the service that was provided by the staff I will definitely be a Petco Pal from now on!!!!It is a great location in Santee, plenty of parking, nice shopping carts very good store<//review>

They were professional and yet great customer service. A smile says a lot. Even though there are bad days when you are greeted with a smile it goes a long way. The young lady was very kind and didn't make me feel guilty returning an item which I hate to do. I am a frequent shopper at Petco and do appreciate great customer service.</Text>

Good place, friendly staff (for the most part). I love their selection of dog toys. It's hard to find a good squeaky toy for my Chihuahua but not here! The only reason it lost a star is because of the grooming salon-not a great experience there.</review>

I came in to ask grooming how would I know witch locations offered the $15 wash your own dog service? I was told she did not know. I asked her if she could call the location in Lemon Grove. She said no she does not have the information or number to do that. I felt like she could have helped me. I left feeling blown off by the way she handled my concourses. But on a way better note. the cashier you rang me up when above and beyond his role to help me and asked me if there was anything else he could help me with. I wish I know his name so I could drop it here in my feed back.</Review>

Customer service was absolutely exceptional! The person I spoke to was very knowledgeable about the products I was interested in as well as with the animals they sell there (I was interested in amphibians and fish).
The store was clean but felt outdated, especially when compared to some other pet store chains.  Fair prices, large selection of goods and animals, and very pet friendly< /text>

<Text>Theresa and Asia (sp?) were both phenomenal. True customer service experts. Theresa went above and beyond with helping us find and acquire everything we needed, as well as Asia helping when we had some issues with one of the guinea pigs and the vet. She handled everything for us when we didn’t know what was going on or what to do. Can’t thank them both enough. Excellent service from Theresa and Asia at the Santee store. Recognition is definitely in order for both of them!<//Text>< pics>

Great pet store! Has all the pet items you would need for almost any pet. We had our dog groomed there and she loved the groomers there. They really love the dogs they clean. The store setup has been changed since adding Thrive, which makes things a little awkward with the small aisles especially if you bring your pet, but all in all great store for all your pet supplies.< /text>

Great place I had mosquitoes in my water tanks and yes the county gives free mosquito fish away but they can only give unlimited amount I have 7 tanks so I need to supplement what the county will give really the only give about enough for one tank so I needed to buy fish for my other six tanks. Usef is very knowledgeable and very helpful when it comes to the fish he may have other their knowledge about other reptiles and animals I'm not sure but I always enjoy his help and his knowledge when it comes to the fish<//text>

I realize it's during the pandemic, however only 2 employees for the entire store means there is zero help on the floor for questions or product placement.< /review>

<Review>What a poorly managed store. Never anyone around to help you, there’s always pallets of back stocked products all over the store. I can never find what I’m looking for and when I do, there’s no variety and they only have one option that’s usually overpriced for the cheap store brand quality. I was looking for a dog harness and instead of having all of the dog harnesses in one section, I found them in about 4 different locations all around the store.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80d958001d312f8f:0x3fa0fc4a0524e2b2</gmap_id></record>

I went in to purchase Sulfodene 3-way Ointment which was listed at over $10 in the store and found out it was cheaper on-line Petco--also I ended up purchasing it from Chewy at a VERY LOW PRICE for the same item--almost $6 cheaper for the same size and product and FREE SHIPPING< /text>

< Review>
We have been in the store several times and Mo has been nothing short of kind, helpful, and goes above and beyond the call of duty to always help us out. He recognized us which I found impressive even though we may just be another customer, he clearly took enough time to really pay attention to us. I had several questions about food options and other things since we are now proud owners of an 8 week old husky and he took the time to answer all of my questions honestly and it wasn't a sales tactic, it was a genuine recommendation or suggestion on what to do and what not to do. We both really had our visit made today. There are other stores closer to us literally two blocks away, but we will drive 15-20 minutes just to be helped by Mo. Thank you sir!< /Review>

We have been coming to this store for the last 13 years.  Refilling cat litter here is much cheaper and better for the environment since you reuse your  own bucket each trip.  We get cat food, toys and even adopted our two newest cats from this store. The Pals Rewards is nice since it can save you a few bucks and you get coupons.</Text>

Watch out! You better stay with your Dog if you go in for grooming.
Don't just drop them off and leave.

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>Usually this place is great. Last week we went to get cat litter and the only bag left had a large slit in the bag. We notified the staff of the slit and figured we would come back later for litter. 10 days later we came back and not only had they not ordered/restocked, but the same bag with a slit was still sitting on the shelf. The excuse given was that they are remodeling and that area had not been restocked for a couple of weeks. We went elsewhere.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80d958001d312f8f:0x3fa0fc4a0524e2b2< /Gmap_id></record>

Store is under construction. A little hard to find things, likely because of that. Staff were generally helpful and were very friendly.</review>

Always a fun place with my pup. I found out they have a return policy in everything, I bought a dog bed and they told me.
What relief....<//Text>

Pathetic! Their website is outdated so I couldn't even get a pet Rx offered online. Manager tried to help without success. Suggest u try Petsmart.<//Review>

Ricardo was very rude. We wanted fish and we picked 2 out and he said and. And .and. he was rude wasn't nice until we where walking away. I dont know a lot about fish my grandkids like them. Next time try to be friendly. I will probably think twice before going back.</Text>

Good store, would give 5 stars for more customer service. Seems like I always need to walk around looking for someone to assist me.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Worst Petco in San Diego. I try to avoid this store like the plague. Awful customer service, current sales usually aren't posted and returns from other stores are shunned. Team members don't know much about animals and give a lot of incorrect information. Management is also rude and misinformed on corporate policy.</Review>< Pics>

Horrible customer service. Had a receipt, paid with debit and refused to give me cash back. Sales rep. Not familiar at all regarding return policy, and processing transaction. Took them more than 25 minutes.</Review>
