Fresh food and attentive staff. Clean and a good place for a quick bite. Just wish they had bottled soy sauce and maybe a place to recycle or compost some items.< /Review>

Fast, fresh, and good prices. Had a great Sour Beer on tap from a local brewery!  Nice tap beer selection; but also carry bottles, wine & Sake. The alcohol prices are a bit high. Staff is friendly and want to help with any questions you may have. No challenges having what you want in your bowl to eat. I've been twice now and will go back again when I'm in a hurry to eat fresh. They also have vegan and gluten free. There's enough seating so you don't feel crowded and can enjoy conversation with whomever you're with.< /review>

Great customer service. Was able to sample a couple of items to determine what to put in my bowl. Fresh ingredients. Local craft beer on draft. Modernized interior. Highly recommended.< /review>

The service was great, I can't really comment on the food.  When I order I pick what I think will taste good and if it doesn't I don't blame who prepared it I blame myself for ordering the combination that I ordered.  I didn't get sick so that's a plus</Text>

<Review>I was referred to this restaurant by a friend and I was not disappointed!

This was my family and I first time eating poke, so we were a little apprehensive about picking ingredients for our poke bowls. However, the staff were patient and answered every question we had. We felt very comfortable and welcomed. We had the tuna and its was fresh, along with every ingredient we added to our poke bowls. The restaurant was super clean and the local beer selection was amazing. We will definitely be back.</Review>< Pictures>

<rate>5</rate><Text>This place is amazing. I had spicy tuna and spicy salmon. I'll be going back again only 2 days after the first time I tried it. The amount of food is insane because so many delicious veggies are unlimited. Unless you've got a large appetite, get a small because 3 scoops of fish is A LOT, even for me. The cucumber is yummy. They work with you on samples if you are unsure of how something might taste. They have all natural sodas and so many sauces to top the poke bowl with. The choice of proteins, bases and toppings is overwhelming, but still good. I liked it a lot and the customer service was great. Also, it is very clean and modern inside. If boba was sold here, this place would be even better.<//Text>< pics>

My co worker and I had a horrible experience with customer service. I feel everyone should be allowed growth so I would like to share my experience. When inquiring about the kids bowl the girl accused us of trying to “cheat the system”. Now as an African American I felt personally attacked by her choice of words. If they knew anything about business or marketing they would know every portion size is priced to profit. Also they don’t have a policy stating your kids must be present. But she was refusing to sell the bowl. I had only asked because I had surgery on my stomach and can only eat a small portion and was willing to buy a regular bowl. Which was not the big deal it was the attitude and her non friendly approach. I will not jump to conclusions and say that this is how this establishment is ran but consumer beware. When we got back to work at the local hospital we shared our experience with co workers and they were shocked to hear because they had been waiting for our feed back since most had not tried it. The rainbow is we went down the street to the other poke place and it was very good.  My response to owners comments: Just to clarify I was never denied service but I was denied my purchase of a kids bowl. And I did state my medical reason apparently it was not heard. I do appreciate the response. And I never said your establishment was racist but lacked sensitivity in your choice of words towards your customers. Making me a potential customer feeling personally attacked as a black customer and your choice of words “cheating the system”. Constructive criticism can bring forth positive change.</Review>

And it was good until I notice something moving on the floor near the trash can. A little mouse was running around and poked his head out and looked right at me. I can honestly say I have never seeen a mouse in any restaurant I have been too until now. I calmly got up and let a staff member know what I had seen and we left! Hopefully this place can get rid of their little mouse problem.< /Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Well, just got done reading Rae Sto’s one-star comment - and man, some people really do buy into this victim trend. Sorry lady, you’re not royalty, the world is not out to get you, they DO have smaller selections to choose from and you can always share a plate or eat a little at a time and use a fridge. Weird that you felt you needed to bring race into it.

That’s a vicious way to talk about a small business trying to get a good start, especially when the owner is working to reach out to you in good faith (and you DID give Taco Bell a 4-star review, so... come on.)

That being said: Lemonshark is a sweet little poke restaurant. This place is nice and open, clean, aesthetically pleasing, has a great vibe, and provides consistently solid food. The fish tastes fresh, the veggie selection is vibrant and there’s a much larger selection than a lot of their competition. Good beers on tap and I like their cherry soda (w/ tarragon!). Great place for dates or to come after a workout. The food sits easy on my stomach and they have a ton of probiotic/anti-inflammatory goods to sprinkle on top (seaweed salad, ginger, etc.). Keep it rocking guys, I love seeing stuff like this pop up in the valley, it’s much needed. You’ve got my support and that of my fam.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I love this place! The food is tasty and reasonably priced. The staff are courteous and professional. They have a wide variety of toppings. Free miso soup when it rains and delivery $2.50 delivery with the Visalia city limits.

My go to selection is the regular poke bowl with brown rice, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and albacore topped with cucumber salad, edamame, tamago, green onions, masago, seaweed salad, crunchy garlic bits and a squeeze of that sweet eel sauce.

The sticky pineapple chicken, coconut shrimp and spring rolls are also very tasty and be a meal on their own.<//text>< pictures>

<review>I am a longtime customer and do enjoy their products. I have spent thousands of dollars on this website between tincture, flowers, and edibles. All other places from which I order regularly include a free gift. This is smart because it lets me learn about new products to order as well as a fun way to encourage me to order again. Kushcab regularly skips sending a gift even though each order is close to 200 dollars, sometimes more. I probably only receive gifts on 1/3 of my orders. I am very displeased and have expressed my dissatisfaction to them in the past. I was told to place another order and they would make up for it in that order. I immediately placed another 200 dollar order and received one small gift instead of the two that should now be included to make up for the mistake and new order. The next order I again received no gift and again was told to place another order. Again, I immediately ordered and received only one small gift. Now, they send no gifts and don't respond to my emails. I plan to take my business elsewhere and implore that you consider this review before placing an order here. My business is treated with respect elsewhere.

Update: Kushcab delivery deleted this review within one hour of me posting it onto their website.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2cb97cd6c931d:0xcd3ad7e7039bfe3f< /gmapID><Rate>1< /Rate><user_id>110255581777359738566</user_id>< resp>

I've ordered several times, and have never  been disappointed.  In fact, they're my first choice for edibles.  It's all I need.  Fast, same day delivery.  Everything is exactly as ordered.  I will continue to use this service, as it's one of the best I've tried.</Text>

We use to get a nice driver that delivered the same day. This time it went through FedEx and it is still not here 2 days later and they already took my 250.00. Now I'm on hold with FedEx. This is a nightmare.< /Review>

This is the first time I’ve ordered from KushCab Delivery, and I will definitely be ordering from them again!

The ordering and payment process was very simple and quick, and the delivery was fast as well!

The product I ordered/received was excellent, as was the free gift I got with my order! Thanks for that!

I highly recommended KushCab Delivery if you’re in California!< /review>

They really deliver on their products and service!  I’m a first time customer ordering for next day delivery and had an issue with the delivery.  Explained the situation to LAKushCab and they sent out a replacement order the very next day. They have great customer service and truly stand by their word. Highly recommend this business.< /Text>

<review>I live in a rural area so getting pods is difficult. Not with KC. I placed my order and was immediately responded to through text by an actual person. I was able to ask a few questions about the process through text and was responded to immediately. Confirming my license was very easy. Couldn’t be happier.<//review>< userid>

Easy online ordering. Packaging with care and discretion. Free gift with your purchase. Good prices, tax isn’t bad at all. I’m at the edge of LA/OC by the beach. I’m already on my second order 😂🥰

Update- I started using this company for Vape pods/carts ordering. I’ve been using the services for several months. Probably on order no.5/6. Me and my co worker has been in on it. Gaining reward points for small discounts later. Great, easy, and fast services.</Text>

Before I rate the individual strains that I tried, I’d like to rate the service itself. While I live in Northern California, I’m still new to the on-line ordering and not using my local dispensary. That being said; to set up your account, be verified, and signed up for news, and getting my FTC 10% off code,  the process was super user-friendly and set up and ready to shop within minutes. I don’t like “razzle/dazzle “ on my sites-just info! KushCab was sooo easy to navigate and to order. I like the way the payment is done. Great idea! Their menu was full of top shelf, Verified Products and I felt safe to shop. The pricing is super fair and you get a goody with your order. And they offer a super deal called “KushCredits” and the more you order, the more you earn back. I’ve placed several orders and I’ve not had a problem with one. In fact, the products I purchased did not disappoint!!
I’ve definitely found my home delivery service!</Text>

Super nice - super good prices. I recently had surgery and didn't want to depend on the opioids prescribed to me so I decided to get some edibles delivered. The prices were super affordable, the site is super easy to navigate through and the delivery process itself left nothing to be desired. The text message updates were from a real person that was friendly and when I came out on my crutches the guy told me that next time he would meet me at my door so I wouldn't have to go too far. Super comforting experience. Definitely recommend.< /Text>

First time ordering from kushcab and I was satisfied with their service. I’ve surely never come across any marijuana delivery team that compares with kushcab.  They have an amazing selection of goods, fast delivery, friendly drivers. I would rate them higher if I could. It's an incredible team that does a wonderful job. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed.</Review>

I was initially very skeptical about using this service but my products were delivered this morning. It was super easy and incredibly convenient if you don’t have time to actually go or simply aren’t familiar where to get certain products in your area.

The packaging was discreet... they even threw in a free krispy treat! No complaints whatsoever. Will definitely be using their services again and referring them to my friends.  Thanks KC!</text>

I love these guys!!! I have been a loyal customer for over a year. They sell only QUALITY products.
They have outstanding customer service! If you order from them you will have the package delivered by FedEx to your house in less than 3 days! Even if you order on a weekend! The products come professionally and discreetly packaged. I buy alot of
Vape cartridges and pens from them as well as flowers and pre rolls. Only once did I have a problem with a car trade and they promptly replaced it with a brand new one! The include all kinds of little surprises in their packages for their long-term customers. I cannot say enough about how great this company is I will be a customer with them forever!</Review>

I loved Kush Cab. I did!
They are always on point with free /extra gifts and trying to have good quick communication BUT as someone who had been getting deliveries from them for almost a year I have noticed customer service slide off as prices have steadily increased.
Adding almost 10$ in tax (which I get is a California thing) THEN charging 15$ For shipping (when it used to be 10$ which is already outrageous for students who are already just trying to get by)
Coupled with customer service reps who clearly don’t know what paypal or google wallet service to use and what money is being sent where.
And the fact the last 3 times I’ve ordered edibles from there they have been stale and inedible has made Kush Cab an inviable option anymore. We don’t order there anymore :/
Which sucks because this WAS one of the cheapest and best options for us just starting out.< /review>

Very friendly people. They were quick to answer any questions I had. Delivered in a timely matter. I got the brownie bites and it came with two. I thought it was 85mg with both brownies but each brownie is 85mg thc, so that was a pleasant surprise. They even added a gummy for me. Wasn't expecting that but I thought it was so nice! Definitely reccomend them!!<//text>

<Review>I have been a customer with KCD for the past 2 years and counting. Hands down one of; if not the best delivery service in Cali. Products are top shelf. Edibles and Vape pens are of the best quality. The service is uncanny. Timely  delivery and excellent customer appreciation. I order consistently from Kush Cab and I’m never disappointed. KEEP UPBTHE GREAT WORK!💯👍🏽<//Review>< pictures>

Ordered on a Saturday and expected to receive on Wednesday. This review is to the customer service which is top notch. A preroll I wanted was no longer available so they gave me a different preroll, which was $5 more, but the extra cost was free of charge to me.

They didn’t have to do that and easily could’ve given me a same price preroll, but that’s just good customer service. Also, I live in north cal but they deliver from LA area through mail. Awesome. Hope they keep refining their menu (even though it’s sweet right now) with more variety when it comes to prerolls and concentrates.</Text>

<Text>So I thought I'd give KC a try.. why not. . sounds nice and easy.. no muss no fuss getting UPS to deliver it I don't have to deal with anyone on a personal level. .again, sounds nice and easy. .. I checked out their website and found a very nice selection of most of the major categories... I like cartridges and flowers so I'm happy with what I've got to pick from.. definitely more to choose from than most on-line ordering website's... Now the pricing per unit is a tad bit higher too but I've no problem paying a few more dollars for their commitment to take up extra space for a larger inventory...Nice job KC Crew and Eugene..
So I went ahead with my first order of a couple of different oil cartridges (Grape Ape and Platinum OG).. in the full 1000mg cannisters.. they must have been out of the full cannisters so sent me 2 500mg of each instead.. NICE JOB EVERYONE!! No big issues ..they just took care of it.. too my satisfaction no less.. now the best part of this review is the condition of the package when it arrived...on time but not necessarily in good condition. . The package looked like UPS had been running over it and then dragging it behind their truck. .. so needless to say my hopes of anything surviving such utter destruction and violence unleashed upon my poor little HAPPY PACKAGE were looking grim. .. BUT OH NO! !! The best HAPPY PACKAGE PACKERS in the business packed my little package and not a scratch or bump or bruise to be found on anything that was safe insides the package.. .Way To Go All of You.. And You Know who You Are Dont Ya?? Great Job. .and now we don't have to start the pain in the butt process of trying to get it made good... 👍👍🏼👍🏾.. so in the end I will definitely be a customer in the future and thanks to the KC Crew and Eugene. .thanks for the Brownie Bite too Guys. . nice little surprise

Update : 10 plus months of using their services and I'm still using them so that should answer the question of Do I still like them? Yes I Do ...<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2cb97cd6c931d:0xcd3ad7e7039bfe3f< /gmap_id></record>

Picked up in Thousand Oaks. Staff is professional and courteous and maintained social distancing. Always have a great selection of cars, but I get basic economy to get me to the airport. The cars are clean, and the process with the online app is terrific! In and out in under 10 minutes!< /Text>

Just an absolute pleasure to rent from Enterprise Thousand Oaks. I rent vehicles quite a bit, at least once a month, and hands down the team here is so professional yet real people that are very easy to work with. I have rented from all of them out there and have zero desire to stray as have found a home for my rental needs.  Shout outs to Grace, Vivian, Abel, Saul and the many others who have made my life easier when renting vehicles.

*Yes, I am a real customer and passionate about outstanding customer service hence the zeal is real.</review>

My family and I have been renting cars from this location for over 3 years now and every time we come in they try to pull a fast one over us and rip us off and in my opinion this is the worst Enterprise I've ever been to and I promise you you'll find a better one elsewhere. The one on Wilber has less selections but its better then the rude management team at this location.<//review>

Very disappointed with this location. Made a same day reservation online, however when I got there at 6pm I was told they don’t respect the online same-day reservations. How is it possible they can take my money but can’t deliver service as expected. Julia was very kind when I spoke to her over the phone to confirm car availability, but the other associate when I went to pick up my reservation was short and rude.

I will be sticking with another provider, and will no longer use Enterprise after this experience.< /review>

Absolutely the best place to rent a car. Not only do they have the best selections but the customer service was stellar. There was a small discrepancy in my paperwork and they resolved it immediately. I have rented here 5 times now and will be back every time I need one. Keep up the great work and congratulations on making a life long customer.

P.S.
I cannot remember the managers name but she did great work and resolved my issue in lightning time.

WARNING!! BEWARE!! Do not rent from This Enterprise location in Thousand Oaks!! They scam, lie and place unauthorized charges on your credit cards! They try to find damage upon return of their vehicles in order to make fraudulent insurance claims. I thought they were scheming and after reading other reviews and I realize my gut was right. I rented from them in Dec, 2020 because someone hit my car and their insurance rental co was Enterprise. Upon return of the car they said they found damage (it was normal wear and tear from driving a car for almost 3 weeks). The damage was on bottom of the side panel under the car. Probably was already there or occurred from ground debris when riding in mountainous or gravel terrain over 25 miles per hour.  They kept lying saying they had to have my insurance info and I refused telling them they have my card on file. I actually took my water bottle and wet an extra mask I had and wiped off the spot telling them I guess renters need to detail cars before returning in order to avoid getting scammed. When they took me to pick up my car I had the repair shop rep give me an estimate and not only was he in shock that they were claiming damage but said he had heard some of the same complaints and told me to never rent from this location again.  He estimated the repair, if any was needed, to be buffing and painting ($600 tops). After picking up my car I went back to Enterprise to get names and one of the guys, Saul Sanchez, said he was one of the mgrs but didn’t know the other guys name...yeah right. A $900 repair cost was placed on my credit card. Days later, a $7.70 charge for tolls was placed on my card. I have a FastTrak acct and added the rental car and my acct was deducted for the tolls. I sent an email to Vivian with proof and no reply nor refund. I went in person and met with Saul Sanchez. Forwarded him the email and showed him the charge. To date, no refund nor reply.  And the car I rented had only 1/2 tank of gas.</text>

I rented a Porsche Cayenne SUV from Enterprise Exotics.  The SUV itself was great, the service from Enterprise? Ehh not so much.  First, when I picked up the vehicle it wasn't filled up.  As in 1/4 of tank of gas left.  Enterprise pushes this whole clean santize thing, yet the infoentertainment console had finger smudges, and a receipt from the previous driver was in the car.   The sticker on the plate was expired, which resulted in me bringing the car back prior to my trip.  On the ride a warning light came up saying the SUV needed 1.3 quarts of oil.  I called Thousand Oaks Enterprise Exotics told them, and they said the miles say you don't need it (the car had under 7000 miles).  After explaining that means nothing, they routed me to Enterprise in the area I was in, who told me they had no idea what oil to fill it with. Back to TO we go, who then said call Firestone who they have a national contract with, well, Firestone had no idea what oil to put in the Porsche and said a high performance vehicle isn't something they like to touch, back to TO we go.  TO had no answers and said I should call road side assistance and see how it will cost.  Fiorget it.  I called the local Porsche dealer who take care of it, and sure enough it needed 1.3 quarts of oil.  What TO Enterprise should have done is simple - call Scottsdale Exotics have them bring me a new SUV to replace mine, prob solved.  Of course, they didn't do that.<//Review>

I rent from Enterprise a couple times a year.  For this location twice and it was good service and good car.  The only thing about my recent rental where I was not completely satisfied was the fact that when I returned the car the day I was suppose to the lot was full and the only parking was the the 2 hour limited parking in the street.  I did not want to have the car towed obviously and was never told it was ok to park there.  I called first thing in the AM and talked to Cameron and let him know what happened and he said I wouldn't be charged for Sunday.  And then I told him I can't return until after 4PM as I am working and could not ask to take off work at the last  minute.  And I thought he told me I wouldn't be charged for Monday either.  Later finding out that I misunderstood  him.  Cameron was nice and I appreciated him taking off what I thought was two days.  Even after I talked to him later and he explained that I misunderstood.  Good CS Service.  Then I received a call from another Rep I forget her name she was not there when I called back and I spoke to another girl who started off cordial until I told her what I thought Cameron told me.  As she was saying only one day and that I could have left the car in the street people do it all time time.  Again I was never told that on both times I rented from that TO location.  She got short with me and not very nice. I asked to speak with Cameron and she said he was on lunch.  I asked if I could leave a message for him and she said "no he is on lunch and you can call him back" rude not good CS Service.  As I am a CS Service Rep and would never refuse to take a message.  I called Cameron later and he explained that I miss understood.  I appreciate his conversation and the fact that one day was being taken off.  However I still do not think I should of had to pay for Monday as this was not my fault the parking lot was full.
Thank you,
Marcy</Text>

I ran into so many problems with this location. Some of them are due to booking through Priceline, but Enterprise should be taking it upon themselves to make sure the information given through Priceline is accurate. (Also, the Enterprise mobile app would not work so booking directly was not an option for us).

First, when booking, we were given the full range of pickup times. But when we actually went to go pick up at 1pm as we had scheduled, I saw that the place actually closed at 1 that day. We called them on our drive over to make sure we would still be able to pick it up at that time and that they wouldn't close without giving us our car. They seemed surprised and a little hesitant. It was a seriously good thing we even saw the hours by chance and that we decided to call... what would have happened otherwise?

Secondly, we were told when booking through Priceline that our car would have unlimited mileage. This is the main reason why we decided we could afford to get this particular car (it was a luxury car but with the unlimited mileage would only work out to about $50 extra for the whole time so we figured it was worth it.) However, when we get there, we learn it's an extra $20 a day for unlimited miles with a luxury car. Thankfully the woman helping us (who was very nice) said she could get us $10/day since that wasn't our fault. Somewhat better, but still frustrating.

The car was only filled to 7/8 of a tank when we picked it up, so she said we only had to refill it to 7/8 when returning it. Not that big of a deal, but it is very hard to estimate filling up the car to 7/8 as opposed to full... we tried but ended up overfilling, so that was a few bucks lost.

I also didn't know this, but Enterprise doesn't go through credit cards for insurance at all like many rental agencies do. I tried looking this information up before renting and couldn't find it anywhere, but I guess it's not on them that I didn't know this. Anyway, so then to insure the car against damage I had to pay an extra $31 a day (again, another discrepancy between Priceline and Enterprise--Priceline's website said this would be $13/day).

We were also misinformed by the woman who helped us that our car would take 87 gas. Not the case. It only took 91.

Additionally, the car's tires kept losing pressure, reaching dangerously low levels one day after another, and we had to refill them twice on our own dime. That was really inconvenient and confusing as to what was causing it.

Anyway, long story short, we thought we were getting a really good deal at first and then the little costs just kept adding up. Though the employees were friendly and few of these problems were their fault, I won't go through Enterprise again. If you must book with them, definitely do everything in your power to book directly with them and not through a third party. Ask tons of detailed questions before you book.<//Text>

<review>Unfortunately a 1 Star is the lowest I can give. Both my vehicles had to go in to a body shop for paint jobs causing the need to for two reservations made by my insurance company. Last week my first car went in for repairs so I received a rental car. The employee at the time was helpful and had service today been the same I would have given a 5 star review however with the service I received today has left me disgusted to even give this location any business. Last week when I picked up my first rental car the Enterprise employee informed me I had two reservations. I explained to her that both my cars needed to go into the shop and I’m doing one at a time and I would be coming to pick up my other rental car on Monday. I show up today to find out that they somehow managed to loose my reservation that the employee who helped me last week said I had only to make me have to call my insurance company to have them send over a new reservation. Due to COVID they do not allow you in the office and instead make you wait out in the heat today being 100 degrees. After spending 30 min to get a new reservation I’m then informed they do not have any cars in my coverage amount and that I will have to pay the difference. By this time I just had to take the cheapest so I could get going. Later in the day I called customer service and Informed them of the situation and explained how unhappy I was.The customer service lady said she would have someone from corporate call me. I received a call a few hours later from Julia Brady and I explained to her the situation. Her response was well you agreed to pay the difference When I picked up my rental. I informed her I had no choice if I wanted to have a way home. I simply asked that she credit me for the difference and just give me the  upgrade at no cost due to the mistakes they made on their end. Julia told me that was not possible and would be unethical for her to adjust a price. I then informed her that what is unethical is to not take care of your customer. It’s not like I got some BMW I was simply given a Chevy. Her response is the best she can do is for me to bring the rental back and she will get me a cheaper car. I then replied will you credit me for today she said no. Please tell me where this girl learned her customer service and how she is a manager.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1598425589462, 'text': 'Hi Caitlin, I would like to know more about your experience so I can help.

< review>
I had booked an enterprise for this thanksgiving weekend. It was a Kia Soul. To my surprise the engine light popped on, and the car started bucking, and all of a sudden it completely lost acceleration in the middle of the 405 freeway.

I contacted roadside assistance and they got the car towed and told me I would surely be reimbursed for using a third party application (UBER to be specific) to reach home.

This morning I called the office, and the customer rep told me they will not be compensating for the UBER ride back home, although they accepted that the car had a mechanical problem.

Being an Enterprise plus member, this has never happened in the history of me renting from you guys. This is unacceptable, because when I called in for roadside assistance, the customer rep told me I would be compensated for everything, including my ride back to home.

I would like to get reimbursed/compensated for a faulty car that wasn't my problem. Moving forward I will not be renting from this location or from any other enterprise location for that matter.

Thank you for such a terrible thanksgiving weekend.< /review>

Getting the car was not an issue, of course it’s business. But returning it was a nightmare, TERRIBLE experience. It was 107 degrees. I was told by THREE employees to wait by the tarp, I was there for about 25 minutes until I said something. This wonderful lady assisted me and I did apologize to her for my frustration. 107 degrees, 25 minutes, with a face mask, I COULDNT BELIEVE IT. Not to mention, three other people got there after me and were helped immediately. I couldn't identify anyone because they were all wearing Laker apparel w no name tags. All I wanted to do was return your car.<//text>

With limited to no parking anywhere around the lot, they picked me up from school at the time I requested.  The car was more than I expected, had ample room for all my carrying needs.  Return was easy, and they are open on Sundays until 3, a great thing for weekend rentals.  I will use them again for sure.</text>

<review>It was easy to choose a vehicle as this company had many more to choose from than other rent-a-car dealers I've dealt with. The car was near new and handled extremely well and met almost all my needs (it turned out to be a bit more cramped than I would have liked). Returning it was no problem and I got a ride home even before I finished checking the car in . Thanks and would use Enterprise again.< /review>< date>

The issue I had was with the actual rental cars. Yes, more than one rental car for a single rental period was needed.

The first rental car made an annoying squeak when driving it on the freeway home from the rental place 6 miles away. I returned that first car to change it for another rental car. The second car the outlet for my electric adapter wouldn’t work. None of the outlets worked in the second car. Rachel at Enterprise was very sweet as she tried to find someone there at enterprise to repair the outlet so I could get back on the road. Anyway, I was given a third rental car, which worked out very well. Unfortunately, a total of 3 hours was spent dealing with rental cars that first day, when the whole rental pick-up transaction experience should’ve taken no more than an hour total.</text>< username>

<Review>BEST EXPERIENCE EVER! Don't waste your time going to any other rental car place in Thousand Oaks/Westlake! If you want individuals that communicate well, treat you with respect, honesty, and have complete integrity along with a stellar positive attitude then this is the branch to go to! Make sure to ask for Spencer and Gui,  they are nothing short of amazing at being so helpful and even went the extra mile to help me find the perfect car to fit my needs with even such short notice they worked around the clock to help me with a rental after my car was in an accident. They took care of all my questions and made this the most effortless and pleasant experience I have ever had in renting a car. Why can't all rental car companies in any industry be like this!?!?! 5 star service and experience across the board!</Review>< user_id>

Be careful in CA.  Never was told about tolls being paid at a prmium from a third party and had to use a toll road because of a traffice incident that created a back up.  I tried to pay the toll on line and was told I couln't because it had to be billed through the rental compny or their partner.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>This place WAS amazing. We would rent their “exotics” at least twice a year. The cars and service was exceptional. This week we attempted to rent again and unfortunately George answered the phone. He tried to push us on a vehicle that we did not want . He said that’s all they had for our dates. We checked online and there were PLENTY of vehicles that were available on our dates. He also kept asking what the previous representatives charged us. Bad service. We will be using another place. Good bye enterprise, you lost over $1,500 annually from us and we will not be referring anyone again .<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Overall pretty good. The person who checked me into my car was nice. The one that was at the register was in a bit of a rush and made a comment about one of my IDs "not being ideal" but good enough to rent a car. That was confusing.< /Text>

I was able to go to enterprise looking to rent just a standard car (something cheap) and the employee that helped me was really nice and helpful. I ended up getting an upgrade for free because all their standard size vehicles where are all rented out. Enterprise's policy is if they are out of the car size you were wanting to rent are all out, they will give you a free upgrade to the next size vehicle.
When I went to return my vehicle I had needed a ride home and the employee there said that he had to leave at 6 so he said he would order me a cab which I ended up paying $23 for.< /Text>

They have both regular rental cars and a luxury fleet if you want to rent something fancier. I've never had to wait a long time here. I also feel like it is a great value that they offer to pick you up and take you where you need to go when renting with them. The prices here are pretty reasonable as well, not amazing pricing, but definitely not exorbitant pricing. I would recommend sticking with Enterprise if you value the experience and knowing you are going to be well taken care of.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1547053256484, 'text': "Hi Taylor Moss, we are very happy to have provided you with such a positive experience!

<text>Overall, the vehicle we used got us to our destination and back. I must say, however, the selection is so limited, regardless of the fact that I reserved by phone many days ahead of time, with specific request of type of vehicle.  Invariably, this location was not able to fill this request.  Taking another vehicle in a rush, we got a car that was so filthy on the inside. Whatever happened to a wipe down, vacuum etc.? On top of this, we were charged more than the quoted price, even though we returned the car in the proper time frame.
We are frequent customers and I feel we deserve better service than this.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Seems to me they've changed in last few years.  They now offer everything average:  good service and cars in decent condition, all at an average price.  Not bad.  In previous years I would go to them first because they would at least get price matching, if not an outright bargain.  I could count on getting the best deal.  Nowadays, they let me walk out and don't fight for my business.  I'm back to shopping each time I rent.  An unexpected annoyance the last time I rented:  they challenged me on my accumulated miles.  Weird!  I had an unlimited mileage contract and had rented the car for about 10 days.  Average daily mileage was significantly less than 100.  Also, they didn't resolve this immediately.  Spent way more time waiting than expected for them to get clear on days rented, finish interfacing with their system, and resolve the matter.  Seems like the concept of express rental might now be old fashioned, despite use of fancy hand-helds. YMMV< /Text><Name>Frank Millar< /Name>< Time>

I used Thousand Oaks Enterprise and I had a horrible experience, they overcharged my card $500.00. There was a women in there who was rude to me. They didn't take proper notes when they spoke to me on the phone. They don't communicate unless you mention you want to talk to a manager. I just don't like there facility. Maybe because of the area they are located in. I am a black woman and in that area not too many black people come in there. I hate to make it a race issue, but when I go to the enterprise located in Northridge or Reseda they have treated me much nicer.</Text>

I rent from this location at least once a month for the last year or so. The customer service is beyond excellent. Super friendly, quick, informative (always get the insurance!) and very very accommodating! Cars are always very clean, have never had any maintenance issues, and usually always get a car with a full tank of gas so I never have to leave there and immediately go to the gas station to fill up. Can't say enough wonderful things about this location. Highly recommend it over other car rental companies in the area. Tried another one once and it was a disaster. Keep up the wonderful work Enterprise! THANK YOU< /review>

Always easy, always a pleasure. My wife and I have established a nice relationship with the staff at our local Enterprise Rent-A-Car. And if there's an issue, they make it right with you. The drivers that will pick you up or drop you off if necessary, are very nice as well. We plan on being loyal customers for a long time.

First time renting a car and it went very smoothly. Wish someone told me they don't care about the rims on the damage report. I noted the rims were damaged in person, and didn't see that reflected on my receipt as noted later when I got home. Which stressed me out. Turns out, they don't really track rim damage or wear. Five stars cause maybe the guy said something and i didn't hear.. i did go in the next day to make sure it was noted, which was a minor annoyance.</Text>

<Review>The Staff at this particular Enterprise location was friendly, professional and personable. They even upgraded me to a car that would have been more comfortable because I was taking a long distance business trip. I needed a more comfortable vehicle with more storage.

Subsequently, Enterprise Rep Dwight spoke with his manager and granted me the upgrade with no issue and no additional fees.
I will definitely be returning to this location for my business rental needs.

Kudos to the Thousand Oaks location!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

It is so nice to know that Enterprise still maintains an incredible culture and service standard that is second to none. Their employees are engaged and helpful. The process is simple and quick and the overall experience is always a step above. I have always been and will always be a raving fan of the Enterprise organization. Thanks for your service for me and my family.< /Text>

< Review>
Recently I had a little fender bender in a parking lot. The other party wanted to assume responsibility outside of their insurance. Though little damage to my car , the shop still needed three days to fix it , So I required a rental car. Enterprise in Thousand Oaks had the SUV I needed, and delivered it to the body shop in a very timely matter.  The reservations by phone were easy.  The staff was polite and efficient. All in all it was a great experience<//Review>

Always super friendly. But always super backed up. Good selection of cars, as well. Just needs more people at the counter, though everyone hustles with a smile. UPDATE: just returned another vehicle, and same experience as ever – super friendly, super professional people, but terribly understaffed. Waited a half an hour in line to return car, and then another half hour wait for the shuttle ride home. This is not unusual here. Just make sure to allocate plenty of time in your day for your transaction. Otherwise, you can expect great service.  ANOTHER UPDATE: Just a reiteration of the professional service here. We rent here with some frequency. Super busy always but the team here handles the rush well; impressive multi taskers and smooth at handling any tough customers bat the desk. We've been renting here since April 2016, and it's consistently good. Probably explains it's business.< /Text>

They put a volume lock on the car's sound system capping it at 45% so we had a tough time hearing podcasts on the trip. No apologies or attempts to fix it, they just blamed us for not making time in our road trip to stop at another Enterprise.<//text>

The week I was moving, someone tried to break into my car and damaged the passenger window and driver door handle... while in the shop, I rented an Enterprise car in Thousand Oaks. It was the best experience I'd had all week. The staff is quick, efficient, capable and friendly. The pick up driver was there on time, relaxed and just chatty enough. Between the wifi install, cable TV, new refrigerator and all else, it made my week. Thank you Thousand Oaks!</Text>

I rent from this location often and overall the experience is pleasant.  On this particular rental I had reserved a pickup (full size) to move some furniture.  Upon arrival I was told no full size were available and because they were closing soon there was no other option.  I understand it’s hard to accommodate everyone’s request but it’s also very disconcerting that I can make a reservation and if there isn’t one available the plan and course of action is oh well sorry.  As we stepped outside to get an suv someone pulled in with a full size to return. The timing was impeccable but it was also a complete fluke.  Being that it was the only truck and the store was closing soon I of course had to accept that particular truck.  The problem was this truck wreaked of marijuana.  I had to take my family and while it’s not the end of the world it was also not how wanted to drive my rental.  Upon return I explained the situation and the staff was very apologetic and gave a free one day rental. Staff and facility was very nice and professional but the policies and reservations could use some renovation. Thanks</text>

I have had many rental cars over the last few years for Business and pleasure.  This is by far the worst experience ever. Cant tell you what cars they have or when they will have a particular type.  Making a Reservation does nothing. Nothing was ready and took over a hour to get out of there in a truck that was dripping wet from the wash , stained interior with dog hair and nose mark's on the glass.
Asked to swap it out a week ago and they still dont have anything...   Customer Service is Dead !!!< /Review>

As you open the door, people at the front desk greet you. However, I felt tossed around from one person to another when I was "checking in". The car selection is null. Some cars (like the one assigned to me) had a soiled interior and it wasn't ready for rental... Matt B. tried his best to accommodate me.</text>

I ended up taking a taxi to my hotel in Thousand Oaks and then visited the Enterprise location in this city the following day where the staff  provided actionable solutions to get me back on the road.</review><user_name>Caitlin Jorae< /user_name>< pics>

ENTERPRISE on Thousand Oaks Blvd. is Fabulous!
The customer service is extraordinary, the employees are always accommodating and knowledgeable, along with "going above and beyond the call of duty" when preforming their job to service their customers.
It is wonderful to find a business that still takes great pride in their appearance, professionalism and THE CUSTOMER is still  #1 !!!< /review>

<Review>There were ten people working the counter - but only one was competent. Unfortunately, he wasn't available to help me.

I left without a car - and I am confident that the clerk I talked to was PROUD to turn me away. He was not a problem solver in the least and seemed to take delight in poking holes at every solution I came up with to make a deal happen.

Ended up using a competitor who helped me out in less than 20 minutes - so I'm pretty sure I wasn't the problem.

Not sure how they stay in business if they delight in turning people away. My advice? Use Budget two doors down.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1526604573167, 'text': 'Mr. Borders, customer service is of the utmost importance to us and we would like to speak with you further about this.

<Text>I had a ppd loaner from my dealership.
The desk service was nice, but the csr said she would put me into a "comparable" car /suv to my full-size Denali suv.   She first tried putting me into a small Nissan pickup, then some other small crossovers with odd colors.  I finally just took a small white jeep (that she "guesses could part with"..haha), no big deal, but the interior was dirty (crumbs, mud on seat, & window smudges).  I was in a hurry, so I dealt with it.  I know there's a $ limit on the free loaner, but understand what comparable is and clean your cars.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Called in the morning to let them know I wanted to swap a car during my lunch break.  I indicated I needed a sedan and if they needed my information to hold a vehicle.  They said no we have plenty of sedans.  I show up at 12:35 and find out they don't have any.  They wanted to give me a Dodge caravan really?  2nd Enterprise this week that cannot accomodate.  1/2 star<//Text>

Enterprise as a company is great.  This location, however, leaves something to be desired.  The parking lot is supremely inconvenient, and they seemed understaffed both when I picked up our car and returned it.  A week or two after the return, we were errantly charged for an extra two days, which they quickly fixed when I called and pointed it out - but what if I hadn't caught it?  We'll keep using Enterprise because of their customer service and prices, but just make sure you check your receipt here.<//review>

<Review>When my car was backed into by someone I had to put my car in the shop. So, I went to Enterpruse Rent-A-Car for my car rental.  I was a little upset because I had to put my car in the shop and at first I wasn't comprehending everything that they told me but anytime I called with questions they answered them to the fullest At the end of the time when I needed to turn the car in  they went above and beyond to make sure my experience was good and I will definitely go back to them and recommend them.<//Review><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>Had a problem with being overcharged for services I did not sign up for... I thought it would be nearly impossible to get my money back, but to my (pleasant) surprise the gentleman who answered the phone took complete care of my concerns & I received ALL  of my money back with essentially no questions asked. Thank you for the great customer service!!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The agents were very professional, attentive and user friendly.
They worked as a unit to limit the time necessary to process the rental agreement.  Each item initialed or signed was explained thoroughly before confirming .</text>

< Review>
I was especially pleased with my recent 4 day rental of a new Town and Country MiniVan.  The staff at the Thousand Oaks facility are knowledgeable, courteous and friendly.  They got me out the door with the vehicle I wanted and honored a commitment that was made from an out of State Enterprise location.  Matthew Finney and his staff run a top notch operation.  I would not rent from anyone else.  Very, very pleased.  Lou .</Review>

< review>
I got rear ended and had to go enterprise to rent a car while mine was in the shop. They gave me very little information about what they were providing and ending up giving me a car that the insurance company wasn't covering and sold me insurance I didn't need. A month later I got a charge for 950$ on my credit card. I went to the shop to get the situation fixed to find that Chris Bloom was very rude to me about fixing the issue. Instead of being understanding he kept asking me to recite exactly what was explained to me a month ago (as if I remember the details of a conversation from over a month ago). He did not fully fix the situation and instead was very accusatory. I would not get here and if you do, do not speak with Chris.< /review>

Great and fast service! They were closed for New Year's on the day I wanted to return the car, so they let me return to the airport location free of charge. That helped me out a lot.</Review>

I wanted a car from this place its own manager made a blunder rather being apologetic about he was using abusive language.
I never had that bad experience where a service providing executive using a cuss words to their customer.</Text>

<Review>Be aware: 1) getting cars with little or no gas, 2) not having the type of car you reserve available (which may mean having to spend more money on gas), 3) getting picked up later than you schedule, 4) having to wait in line, even if they pick you up late - which makes you later, 5) less then efficient or helpful phone etiquette. The branch gets a lot of new employees and transfers them often. Since the new regional manager came on board (April/May 2017), not running so smooth - employees perhaps not happy with him. Long lines with 1 or sometimes no front desk staff, staff seemingly undertrained, over stressed. The current group of employees talk about each other behind each others backs (Spring/summer '17), in front of customers, and while in the car, getting driven to and from the branch. Some of the staff are nice, current r. mngr who is patronizing. The staff & drivers complain about him too. // However, the current branch manager is very nice and helpful. - Be aware that Enterprise also owns Alamo & National rent a car. 6/23/17<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< user>

<Text>I reserved a standard car as I needed to drive 5 people. I got there and no one told me there was a problem until looking for the car. The sales person then says that they do not have the compact that I reserved but do not have anything except for a Silverado truck or a 2 door dodge charger.  I took  the Silverado and then exchanged it a day later for a very nice Hyundai Sonata.  I understand that sometimes mistakes happen and I made the best of it, but the thing that annoyed me is that no one told me the problem at the beginning and they maintained that the Charger technically is what I reserved.  That is just silly.  The exchange was fine.  The people were very nice.  The parking lot is awful so be very careful.</Text>< user>

This place is a fraud!  They represented they had a Range Rover they could provide while mine was in the auto shop being repaired.  After one hour waiting at the auto center they picked me and drove me to their store only to tell me they don't have Range Rovers.</Text>

<text>Liar liar - my car was not properly serviced, I was 100 miles away from the office when the engine light went on.  I couldn't reach the office, so I put in a quart of oil, light did not go off, drive the car back to the agency.  I complained, and they promised to comp me the rental which they did not.  They promised to reduce the amount due by the cost of the oil and funnel, which they offest by charging me for gas, which I had refilled, and THEN reducing the price.  Completely not happy with these guys.  They rented me a car not ready to drive and didn't make things right rather they over charged me.  Don't rent from this location!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I am a frequent customer here. The employees and the pick-up drivers are very friendly and efficient and smiling, really make it a nice experience, and I appreciate the weekend rates. I only wish the pick-up and drive back hours were not so limited.</review>

<review>Take note that the low star ratings are limited in number and they are not a reliable reflection of Enterprise's overall performance.  My agency has a contract with Enterprise, so I am there on a frequent basis, and I give my rating based on more than an isolated encounter.  The staff are always courteous and informative, and I know their drivers on a first name basis.  The foregoing said, every once in a while I see customers who fail to listen closely to what the staff says, trying to place blame for their own inattention on the staff.  In response to one of the one star posts I read, yes, insurance via Enterprise is optional, and yes, Enterprise will offer it to each customer with an advisement that it is their choice to purchase it ... when it is offered, if you decide for forego a call to your insurance carrier to get their input, don't blame someone else.  Also, if you don't drive a high end car but are in an accident with your car in the shop and end up making a decision to rent a higher end model, I doubt the staff at Enterprise did any arm twisting to rent a car that would put the customer out of pocket ... I've always heard each representative ask the make a model of the car in the shop so they can put the customer into a comparable vehicle.   If you need a rental vehicle, I would always suggest that you make Enterprise your first choice.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80e82522734e4bb3:0x3d0d503e23f88b5< /Gmap_id></record>

Available pickup trucks and cargo vans. This time I got a brand-new midsize cargo van. Charge begins only at time of rental (Another rental firm charges cancellation fees after reservation is made). AAA, AARP, COSTCO members may get 5% discount.

On 05/25/17, I reserved a large pickup truck, as i did not see midsize cargo van when booking from Enterprise app or online. When I returned vehicle 05/31, i asked and site manager told me to call a couple of days in advance to request mid-sized cargo van.

BTW,  I found making reservation from app could get a lower rate than that online.< /Review>< rate>

Well, happy that the amount needed to move on was reduced. However, I did not realize a couple of things. That re-newing the contract would require another $ 300.00 . So im without a car, unable to go to work tomarrow. So my question is " human kindness". I am a registered Nurse who has fallen upon hard times. I get paid every 2 weeks, & work extra via Registry work, providing extra income. You guys did not work with me to keep my rental. The gal that helped me was initally great, but then rushed me off your lot, because I could not come up with the necesssary money to go forward with my rental. Wow , hmm lets see, I have been a customer for over 2 months, good revenue for Enterprise & now I will never rent a car from you folks unless a rental car is provided for me tomarrow.

Sincerely,
Debra< /Text>

<Review>Let me start by saying in the last couple years I have used Enterprise extensively. However this visit and the one before were dismal. This time, waited in line for an hour to rent a car with ONE rep at computer who was multii-tasking. Then needed to extend rental twice during one rental and the Thousand Oaks, CA (Thousand Oaks Blvd) office once put me on hold and never returned and then when I tried to call back in twice more n one answered the phone. I had to call their corporate number to handle, and extending leases is only handled locally. On the first extension for just one rental period the corporate office got through, and on the second they could not. The corporate rep said she was writing an email to the local manager and district manager who she assured me would be in contact. They did not. Really lousy customer service, but may be to too few employees in the office, who are over-worked.<//Review>< pics>

Fast, friendly service, but their car selection is pretty limited unless you want a truck or van. Seriously the parking lot was overflowing with trucks and vans and they were sending cars out that had just been washed.</Review>

I have used Enterprise Rent-A-Car at this location a lot, like 50+ days of rental in 2 years.  Originally,  I gave them a solid 5-star rating, but after my most recent rentals, I decided that, to be honest, I can no longer do that.

Service has always been very good in the sense that they picked me up within a reasonable amount of time, drove me back promptly,  personnel was overall very polite and helpful, and their prices have been overall competitive.
However,  as this location prides itself to be the busiest Enterprise location outside of airports, in my opinion they are starting to suffer from their own success. In fact, the last 3 rentals, by the time I got there to pick up my car (and it was not on late afternoon on Fridays before the w/e begins) the choice of cars available was truly weak: basically just one car and we were staring at an empty lot so that even upgrading to a higher class was not an option. They probably decided to reduce their inventory, and that is fine, but this will force me to reconsider my loyalty to them. I am also a little annoyed that their cars are almost never ready with a full tank of gas. In some occasions cars were not very clean either.  Sure, if I am lucky and I get a very new one, chances are it is in pristine conditions, but if the car has 20-30k it come with stained seats (in particular the back seats where kids often seat), smudges everywhere on the console, etc.  That is not cool.
I also could appreciate cleaner side mirrors. Too often they have been full of dead water stains which, in the California' sun, can make it hard to monitor traffic on the road.  These are minor things that are easy to fix and will show a tad more attention to details.  Finally, there is a huge personnel rotation. After one year, there is not a single  person with whom I had developed some familiarity.  Their exotic car rentals is a nice addition, but they keep just a minimal inventory and so every car has to be booked in advance. It is not likely that, say, one w/e you get there, see a nice exotic cars (and I am not even talking the supercars for $1000+/day, but the more common ones like Porsches, Audis, BMWs, etc.)  and decide to treat yourself to one of those. Nope, most often those are for clients who reserved them and are about to pick them up. For many months they were under renovation and as a customer I was sold that they were improving to increase their offerings, including exotics, but that did not really happen, not the way I would have hoped at least. So, to conclude, personnel is still 5-star, but their product is not. Hence my 4-star rating.<//text>

<user_name>Hamid Cooper< /user_name><review>cars are often dirty and smell bad.  i've tried to give them a second chance, but it's the same every time - dirty cars, no rear view camera in most of the small cars and the cars are old.  I don't know why the car cleaning crew that's right there on location, doesn't do a better job.  and the staff constantly ask how was service, yet they do nothing about it.  I'm done renting there.< /review><Rate>1< /Rate>< user>

<Review>I don't expect much from a car rental place, but I do expect them to clearly list out the charges beforehand, and give me a receipt of it.

They didn't, said they will email it to me, and I see that they added insurance, which they didn't even bother to ask if I wanted!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Customer service was ok. Car was not available when I arrived ... had to wait 15 minutes for them to clean it which put me late for work. When I checked out 4 days later they overcharged me by about $75.

Our family has been coming to this dental office since we were kids. The dentist might retire but we just move on with the new one that takes over the practice. Dr. Pak is wonderful! My favorite hygienist, Sue, has cleaned my teeth for the last 12 years and I know they'll replace her with another good hygienist when it's time for her to retire. I highly recommend this place to anybody<//Text>

Amazing, amazing dental office! The staff is so caring and accommodating. I have mega anxiety about dental work, and they are so good about that! Dr. Pak is professional and amazingly efficient with her work. I’ve literally never had a cavity handled so well. Both her and her assistant were super friendly and helped talk me through everything which was a major relief. The office staff, Jody, I believe, is so nice and friendly.
Also, they have the office very much COVID-19 ready and follow strict guidelines to keep everyone safe. So bonus points for that. And lastly, each little operating room has a great view of the patch of forest behind the office.
I lucked out finding this dentist, I am actually not nervous to go back!<//text>

Dr. Pak and her staff are super nice, professional, and relatable including the office manager,  dental assistant, hygienist and the doctor. They were gentle with my teeth and didn’t try to push for unnecessary dental work. I feel like they really want the beast for me and my teeth not what’s best for their pocket book. A+ service and care in my opinion. Thank you team Pak!<//Text>

<text>Our experience with Dr Paks office has been great.  We had seen Dr. Meaglia in the past and were very happy with him but now that he has Dr Paks and new staff we were hesitant to switch.  The staff and Dr Paks have made us feel very comfortable and welcome.  They accommodated our schedule and worked us in for teeth cleaning.  The updates they have made to the office makes it more painless for the teeth xrays and I am able to see what they are discussing with me on the big screens.< /text>< Pics>

I have gone to this office for several years now. They are proactive in caring for my health. I love how they put things on “wait and see” instead of immediately doing a procedure that might not be necessary for a few years. This visit brought a new hygienist, and she was excellent. Great to see this office hire excellent employees when needed. I recommend this dental office without reservation.
Satisfied patient,

The staff really care about your dental health and go out of their way to make your visit a pleasant one. They listen to you and are friendly, accommodating, and professional. I’ve had many issues with my teeth over the years and can’t say enough good things about the quality of their work. I highly recommend Dr. Meaglia and Dr. Pak!< /review>

< review>
I had found Dr. Pak in a last minute emergency situation. I had just chipped a large piece off my front tooth. In my panic I searched for a dentist that took my insurance plan. She was 1 of a couple of dentist near by but for what ever reason I was compelled to call her office. My panic grew as I had realized it was after 4pm and most offices close around 5. I called and told them what had happened I was put on hold for a minute. They told me I could come right in. Dr. Pak  squeezed me right before closing time, fixed my tooth and did an AMAZING job! It looks way better then it did before it broke. Now 6 months later you still can’t even tell that it was broken! All the staff are so friendly and welcoming.  They just make you feel so welcome and treat you as they have known you forever. I promise you won’t be disappointed!</review>

I have been a patient for about five years now and I am always appreciative of the communication leading up to an appointment, during, and after. Everyone involved is professional and affable. After leaving a dentist I loved in Los Angeles, I was worried about finding a good fit up here and I feel very lucky to be with Dr. Meaglia and now Dr. Pak as well.< /review>

Our family of 5 have going to this office for 15 years now.  We were sad to see dr. Meaglia retire but couldn’t be happier with dr. Pak.  She is amazing and dr. Meaglia did a great job picking her to replace him.   Great staff, very caring and fun too!<//Review>

Is doing a exceptional job taking over for Dr. Meglia, her work is very professional and she is very proficient in her trade.  Her and her staff are handling the Covid situation with great caution and with great safety.  I can tell they are trying hard to be very safe.  Thanks for the continued concern for our safety and the excellent service you and your staff provide.</text>< Pics>

{'time': 1538435741339, 'text': "Hi Janine. Thank you for your feedback. Unfortunately, our front desk/office manager has had a family emergency last week and we have been working without her for several days. Our usual chart review was delayed, so we weren't able to give you more notice about your scheduled appointments. Apologies for that. Regarding dental x-rays, we are very cautious about patient exposure to radiation. We know about the negative effects of too much radiation; we are also well aware of what happens when dental disease goes undiagnosed - pain, infection, premature tooth loss. We understand that everyone has a right to choose what medical/dental procedures that they want to undergo. As dental professionals, we are governed by the Dental Board of California. Continuing to monitor patients without diagnostic x-rays for many years (as this is what has been happening) might be construed as neglect. As a side note, the radiographs that the orthodontist orders is great at showing the position of teeth and jaw structure, but these aren't diagnostic for determining cavities.\nWe are sure you will find a dentist that suits your needs better. Best of luck!"}< /resp>

VERY UPSET.  Dr. Pak took over for our beloved Dr. Meaglia, who we've been seeing for the past 8 years.  Their office called me 2 hours before my 4 children were due for their cleaning and told me that they would not see them unless they were all x-rayed.  I do not give in to medical bullying and told them that I would not submit my perfectly healthy children to un-necessary x-rays.  They hadn't even SEEN them.  I tried to tell them that I would have their orthodontist forward their x-rays and that only giving me 2 hours was extremely inconsiderate.  IN THE END, THESE PEOPLE WILL NEVER TOUCH MY CHILDREN.  Medicine is suppose to be consented and worked on as a team - not forced into potentially un-necessary procedures.  SHAME ON YOU, DR. PAK.< /review>

< Review>
Jasmine was amazing. She explained everything to me in detail and made me feel comfortable about the decisions I was making. She left no questions unanswered. I did see some complaints from others about the unexpected visit, however, this has been something that has been hanging over my head over A long time and it needed to be taken care of. I can appreciate A visit such as this one.< /Review>

Yes! I was very pleased with this program. Kristina was so polite and educated. So much more personable than a phone conversation. She really took the time to explain to me what my options were and I am looking forward to continuing my relationship .< /text>

5 stars go to Violet and Zachary. What a great team. Olive branch has been presented to me as a caring and successful company. Although I didn’t meet the criteria for this program, I highly recommend it to those that do. I can’t wait to refer friends/family/co-workers to them.</review>

My representatives Juan Amaya and Iris Rodriguez were very patient with me. They actually came to my home multiple times but i was always busy, and they always understood and gave me time. I never thought this program could benefit me so much. They explained everything very well, and were very kind and fun to be with. I would be recommending Juan and Iris to everybody I know in need of help. Thank you for everything.<//Text>

<review>Juan Amaya was excellent. We solved together one of my biggest problems which is my debt. I finally feel like I have a strong piece of mind, and I can get to save more money and focus on the things that matter in life. I strongly recommend him and olive branch to everyone out there. Juan was very professional, caring and extremely knowledgeable, and well spoken. He helped me and my husband more than what he could possibly imagine, and for that, I’m forever grateful.</review>< pics>

I recently signed up with Olive Branch after several days of missing my Rep. Jillian Jackson. I was very busy and unavailable every time she came to my home, but that didn't deter her...she was very persistent and seemed determined to speak directly with me. Finally we met and she was very polite and professional with her presentation. Without hesitation I signed up with her and felt reassured that I made the right decision in doing so. She also made herself available at any time should I have any questions or concerns. I would definitely recommend her and Olive Branch services to family and friends.</review>

I run a business and got excited when Violet showed up. She’s everything that my husband and I would ever look for in an agent. Great communication and problem solving skills - professional, honest, knowledgeable- and most importantly ‘caring’. Olive Branch is not for us but it’s looking astonishing with Violet around< /review>

< review>
Last week I had the pleasure of meeting Violet and Zachary. They came to my home to follow up on information Olive Branch had been sending me. At first I was a little hesitant to openly speak about my finances with them, but after getting to know them both I knew I was in the right hands. Both Violet and Zachary were extremely professional and answered all of my questions with full transparency. Also, something that really stuck out to me and my husband was that they even showed me different options I could use instead of just focusing on what their company had to offer. Throughout our discussion Violet lit up the room with her personality and Zachary was extremely detailed and knowledgeable about the pros and cons of each option and how it would effect my family now and long term. I told them that I wanted to think about it, and actually called them two days after my financial evaluation to schedule an appoitment for early next week. I can honestly say I can’t wait for them to return and can’t wait to join the olive branch team. These two young professionals were incredible and I know if olive branch is anything like Violet and Zachary I am in the good hands and my family will be heading in the right direction. Please extend my appreciation to them both and tell them I can’t wait for our appointment.</review>

Juan Amaya and Keith Lovett were angels from heaven. I couldn't believe when they came to my door dressed so professional. I thought they were selling bibles or that they were lawyers but I'm glad I listened to them. I've been wanting something like this for years, but I never trusted anyone through mail or phone, so the fact they came to my house was amazing. Juan was so caring and awesome, God sent him here to help me. extremely knowledgeable and patient. I'm very grateful for this program and I would recommend these two gentleman to anyone I know. if you're reading this, go with olive branch. this has been a headache of mine and now, I can finally live my retirement happy and in peace. I'm so impressed by the service Juan and Keith provided to me. we watched family feud together because I considered family. thank you so much for approving me. amazing service and amazing program. you need more representatives like Juan and Keith< /Text>

To whom it may concern, my name is Cassandra and I’m a new small business owner. I must say- Olive branch... you’ve lucked out with Violet & Zachary. What a killer combo. After going over the evaluation, we came to the conclusion that this wouldn’t be the best option for me at this time BUT I asked them for their contact information and I will definitely be referring my clients and friends to them. The future is bright for these two.</text>

I am apalled at someone showing up at my door showing me my name and amount of debt I owe. She refused to leave her company information and claimed not to have a business card. Your company is fortunate I didn’t call the police. There r companies that send materials by mail and others that call and i have a choice whether to read or listen. I didn’t expect someone unannounced coming to my door with my personal information. This was an invasion of privacy. My family was adversely affected by the visit as you don’t know if there is someone planning to rob you or hurt you. You obliterated all possibilities of ever doing business with your company. Very bad business practice and irrefutably unacceptable.</Text>

God sent Jasmine Neshawat and Robert Parada to my front door. They're very good people , because during their time with me ,they  were  patient. I had been paying my cards and kept getting back into the same situation, but now I feel like I finally have a solution to my problem. I wish that anyone who has the same situation as me can get qualified and have this headache lifted.<//Text>

I had the pleasure of meeting Jean Aleman a couple of days ago and I am very pleased with the work he put in to help me get out of debt the fastest and the most painless way possible. He is very down to earth and made me feel very comfortable not to mention knowledgeable and professional.   He took his time to make sure I understood everything to the fullest and made the transition very smooth for me. Im very happy he knocked on my door and Im looking forward to being debt free in the near future. Thank you Jean.</Review>

My representatives Juan Amaya and Rick Zacharko were amazing. I am very satisfied with these two gentleman that helped my wife Monserrate Gonzalez, and my family. The work they did was impecable, Juan was extremely nice, and explained everything smoothly. I would recommend these two men to anyone out there in need of help. I am beyond impressed. If it was up to me, i would give them 10 stars, but google only allows 5. God bless you Juan and Rick, and thank you and Olive Branch for helping my family.< /Review>

I was an OTR driver for R+L Carriers at the Montebello, California terminal. One of the best companies I ever worked for. The equipments are prestige and management is some of the best people I ever had the pleasure of dealing with. I learned a lot during my times at LAX and my experience was memorable. Very caring and family atmosphere. I highly recommend anyone with a CDL to give them a try!</Review>

I'm from NYC so I definitely needed a spot where they can fade and cut. Be prepared to drop $35 for a cut but it is WELL WORTH IT! Theres a guy who cuts right behind the register area, totally forgot his name but he was super professional and gave me a legit haircut. Highly recommend.< /Text>

<review>No respect to peoples time man. I called and asked if they were booked/full before I went in. They told me there were no walk ins and they suggested I come in. I came in and the place was full. Wait time was taking forever (was there about 45 min) so I decided to leave. My time has never been disrespected like this before.< /review><gmap_id>0x80dcded058c727c3:0xa01627d9cb5e72e1<//gmap_id>< name>

Great service from an incredible group of quality barbers. Hands down my favorite place to get a haircut before any important event or occasion.  I highly recommend this place because you won't be disappointed with the care and time each barber spends perfecting your haircut. Make your appointments with Luis, Thomas, Julio and Ortega.< /text>

This place is the best. The barbers are all gentlemen and excellent barbers. My
Barber today was Tomas Ramirez and he was 5 stars plus. No matter how busy they are they do not compromise or hurry through the cut. Precision and art meet here and it’s well worth the wait. If you call a day ahead you can book an appointment.
To all of you barbers at South Coast Barbershop  we say Thank You.

Along with the # of walk-ins all coming in early that morning made for a longer than expected wait time. I’d like to invite you to come back and give us another shot we don’t compromise quality for quantity at our shop in order to ensure everyone leaves happy with a great cut. Thank you for your feedback we are always looking to improve, have a nice day sir!'}<//response>

Remember them old days riding my bike to school. It was really close to my house, like 8 block away. Had great time the years I spent at Sutter. I remember having to run the mile every Wednesday. Or going to Mickey D's after school right across the street with all of my classmates. Them old days were just awesome. Sucks that I was not able to continue at Sutter.<//text>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>Two of my classes had no actual teacher, they were all subs. Science teacher left a month after school started so we had a bunch of subs for the 1st semester. English teacher left or got fired apparently so we had to have a sub for the entire 2nd semester until the last few weeks we had our actual English teacher. Teachers are somewhat fine though they dont really care about you. There aren't many fights at school but if there are it is very violent. Other than all of this i had a good time in this school.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c29bf037b1b4bd:0x940802a48c58eeec</gmap_id></record>

This School was good when I started 6th grade but after I finished 8th grade this school became a complete trash. Take it from me a student who attended to this garbage they call a school. Also the management of this school is so bad that whenever a student decides to ditch class he/she has nothing to worry about because the dean is to lazy to do his damn job.<//Text>

<review>I've only been to this campus one time, just in my 5th grade year, just for a Field Trip in Spring 2006.

Their yellow Coffee cake was so good. I saw some former classmates at this school from the 4th grade.< /review>< pics>

I attended this school from 6th to 8th grade about 5 years ago and the staff is exactly the same, the nurse is the same the teachers are the same and the teachers and staff only care if you go so that they could be payed more, they truly are bullies!    If I could give this school a zero, I would, this school is horrible, the administration is horrible and they don't help their students, this whole school has to be investigated due to the fact that they do absolutely nothing in order to help their students.</review>

It is the worse school I've could off ever ended up. Teacher pick on students. The staff loves to make parents feel like retards. And the SST meetings are not helpfull at all, they use them to point out negative and very discouraging stuff even if there is progress. Also if your child ever complains of being hit gotten things thrown at him believe him/her. Teachers like bully kids there one teacher there crumbbled a peace of paper and threw it at my son. The principal there does nothing they all focus on a child negativity but don't even help at all. And when there was a teacher sexually molesting about three girls in there they did not notify us as our children were expose to such abuse. i found out by a parent of one of the victims.< /Text>

<Review>Pros: The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The store has a huge inventory of gaming miniatures.

Cons: The store is a mess. I have a really hard time shopping there because it’s so difficult to see what they actually have in stock and for sale. Most aisles are clogged with boxes. Over the course of several visits over a month, there’s been no sign of a major effort to organize everything.</Review>< Pics>

Was in last week to buy some DnD books, and they hiked up most of the prices up to 30% compared to online. I'd done my online research in advance so I knew they were scamming me on the price, but it feels like they took advantage of my being a newbie and a female.

It's also still so gross in there, I had to step over their mess to even get in. I was really excited to discover this shop, but I don't think I'll be back.<//Text>

For D&D books you can always check the back of the book to see the MSRP, it is an easy way double check any prices for books. We can not match online prices that are below MSRP. The only books in our store above MSRP are the limited edition alternate covers of the books because they are out of print. We are also sorry about the mess, our remodel has taken longer than expected'}</Resp><GmapID>0x808559ebc10568a5:0x1f7e30453afe4504<//GmapID></record>

This store isn't well organized which seems to be trend with most game stores. Stuff is all over the place. The employees are great and welcoming, however the prices are absurdly uncharged. I bought a booster box of King's Court for YuGiOh and was charged over 100 dollars. When I checked the price online it's median price was around 80 bucks. I get that small businesses need to make money, but 20 dollars more? I don't agree with that. If you want to support a local business come here only if you're okay with being upcharged.< /Text>

As for our prices, we charge customers MSRP. You can get a discounted price if you preorder items, but we sell booster boxes at what Konami tells us to, which is $3.99+tax per pack. 24 packs multiplied by $3.99 is $95.76+tax. People can sell things online for cheaper because they do not have to pay rent, employees, electric, internet, etc. We can not match those prices unfortunately.'}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Didn’t realize this is the same people who owned gamer’s guild just in a different location down the road as google’s images are showing the old location.

Even then the store is somehow a giant mess. They split the store to where the trading card games and warhammer stuff is all in the front, and any other board game is in a different room behind a giant field of junk. It made it look like you couldn’t even walk back there without permission.

I ended up getting a hero pack for a LCC which was priced at $14.99. It was an older pack and the two newest packs were priced at $17.99.
Even places like amazon have the same pack for $14.99.

I go to the counter to purchase it and the guy goes “Oh um, this is actually $17.99 and he gave me this vibe as though he was suspecting me of price tag switching.

I’m not a confrontational person so I just accepted it until of course after I left and saw that they upscaled the price on me for no reason when everywhere else had it for the $14.99 price.

This exact thing happened to me before at gamer’s guild and it’s the same reason why I’m not going back.

So if anyone else goes to this store, be sure to have comparable prices ready to show so they can’t rip you off by increasing the price at checkout.<//text>

<review>This little gem of a store is perfect. Extremely friendly staff and an extensive selection of products. Quality products at reasonable prices. I've been in several times now and have not once been disappointed with each experience. Whether you are an experienced gamer or a novice this store is a must visit for sure. I've been recommending this establishment to all my friends and family since my first time in. I've also started a weekly Sunday board game campaign here and I'm looking forward to DMing many more to come.< /review><rate>5</rate>< Date>

Only downside would be that I dont really play MyG and fridays/saturdays can be very busy with tournaments.<//review><Name>Daniel Uunknown</Name>< GmapID>

<Text>Honestly every time I go there i'm reminded why i don't usually go there it's dark messy and they always seem to have just enough product  to get you tempted but then seem never to have what you need. The staff is also generally unprofessional and there are constant boxes of "stuff" all over the store. Find another game store unless you just need the bare essentials like packs.<//Text>< pics>

Super chill place, everyone was cool helping me and a friend get into MTG. Love how everything is super relaxed and feels like a basement/garage hangout with friends.< /review>

Increased Space, Increased Fun. The owner has acquired the space next door and has created one of the better gaming areas in the east bay. If you have been there in the past and were disappointed in the excessive clutter, I recommend checking it out again. The space has been greatly improved and there are some 10+ large gaming tables for RPGs and miniature games with plenty of space to maneuver around them. The selection is still great. M:TG, Warhammer Fantasy and 40K, Dungeons and Dragons, plus a whole lot more.<//review>

The staff is knowledgeable, but the store is very disorganized, very dim, and doesn't feel very clean at all.

The worst offense however is that they overcharge for both product and events, by a rather large margin. If you come in for Magic products, they go off of ChannelFireball prices, except they charge slightly higher than even that. As far as events are concerned, their prize pool is terrible for the amount that you pay, which is to say, overpriced.< /review>

< Review>
Evening Rose Cafe is a quaint little restaurant tucked off of the highway in Nice, CA. They serve delicious breakfast with good-sized portions. They also have sandwiches and  entrees and if you're hungry for a little something more they accommodate that too. The only downside is that they're only open till 2 p.m. but I think that's also part of what makes them special. It's never super crowded. They always have a good amount of customers, most of whom are regulars, but it's not so noisy and overcrowded that it's uncomfortable. The food is really really good and they can accommodate special orders. Not organic foods but if you want something left out that you don't like or if you want a special omelette they will make it for you if they can. The decor is nothing special it's just very small and very quaint and very comfortable. it's never too cold in there. It's never too warm in there. It's just a comfortable tiny little place that I've referred to as a hole in the wall, even though it's too quaint to be called a hole in the wall, that has really good food and I suggest giving it a try. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. One more thing you can call or walk in for to-go order requests.</Review>

The food was great. The service was great. Our waitress continuously came around to refill coffee and was very nice. I got the French toast, eggs, and bacon.<//Review>

The Evening Rose is a wonderful little cafe with friendly staff that make you feel at home. The restaurant is located in the original Nice post office and has a rustic kitchen dinner vibe. I particularly enjoy their omelets, though they have great omelets also. It is great place to meet up at after church. Only downsides for me: they are only open until 2 pm and serve soda by the can. Other than that, I have nothing but praise for them.< /Review>

I love this place. It is off the main hwy so if you don't know of it unfortunately most don't see or know about it. The food is good, it's quaint and quiet and the service is always friendly. Best place on the north side of the lake for a decent priced meal.< /Review>

Great ole country kitchen with tons of seating, great service, and a hefty menu of everything you'd expect from a cafe and grill.

Located 100-yards off the highway, make it just enough to feel peaceful and somber beyond the large sunrise facing glass.

This gem is the perfect breakfast nook!< /Review>

A great place for a simple, deliciously cooked meal! My girlfriend and I stopped by here for a quick bite to eat while visiting Clear Lake. We tried the Chicken Strips with Fries and the Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich and would seriously recommend!<//text>

Nice to see an old Sizzler around here.  The pandemic has made them close down their salad bar, but we go here for the steak.  The managers here buy good steaks , the meat is high quality.  The New York and Prime rib were very tasty .  I just wish they had mash potatoes.  Garlic mashed potatoes instead of just fries .< /review>

Is it too much to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar?  Apparently it is because only some sort of red vinegar and soy bean oil was offered.  There were a variety of other dressings, but I was looking for the healthiest option.  The mash potatoes was cold on arrival.  The clam chowder was just meh.<//text>

<review>It's been awhile since I've even seen a Sizzler! I had to stop in for a Malibu Chicken... I took it to go & it was really good! Hostess who took my order was very nice & surprised to receive a tip.

<Text>The meal I ordered was very good, the presentation was nice. Not very crowded for that time of the day. Parking is rather tight because it's located in a small shopping center with small shops and fast food restaurants. So parking may or may not be available.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>The waiter stood guard at the salad bar! Who does that? Funny, the managers sit in the back office watching cameras. Are people really stealing food?  Adult guests at an adjacent table were denied a separate plate for their bread. They were not on a date!
The Hayward location is worth the drive for quality and service.<//review><Time>1558121679555< /Time>< Pics>

<text>This location has been around for many years and is still one of the better Sizzler locations in the Bay Area. The salad bar is well stocked and clean, the kitchen items are cooked well and they still bring out cheese toast every time we go without us having to ask for it.< /text>< pics>

For instead they  charge you for  6oz steak for $22 .99 when it said you get 8oz steak for $22.99. I got a 6oz steak for$22.99 instead of$12.99, they put your food in a cardboard box to go and change you 10 cent a bag. I had photos but I just delete them today.<//Review>< Pics>

I haven't been to sizzler in years. But I loved it so much  In the past that in on Easter I searched high and low and drove way out to San Leandro from San Francisco to find one. To make a long story short I was quite surprised by how  Expensive they had became!  Unfortunately the food quality was very poor. I won't be going back. Sincerely disappointed.

<Text>First time I have been in a Sizzler in at least 15 years. And this one was very good. The food was good, the service was good, and the prices are competitive. The menu options have changed somewhat over the last 15 years, but the quality is still there. My grandmother and I used to always go to Sizzler in San Jose California. It was one of her favorite places to dine. And I had good memories having dinner there and reminiscing about my grandmother's days.<//Text><Rating>4<//Rating><date>1544233269145< /date>< response>

I was so happy when I seen a sizzler at san leandro since I love the one in colma. The salad bar was terrible and the food was cold. Bad service... our waitress only came once with clean plates. We never got ask if we wanted a refill or more bread.< /Text>

Food was horrible. Service was ok.

Chef needs to learn what a medium steak looks like.
Frozen chicken? Nasty. Please make your food fresh, even if the portion is small.
Crispy shrimp, to hard overcooked.</text>

<text>Dining room had a section in pretty significant need of repair. They have caution tape to cordone off the area. The salad bar is pretty small for the price IMO. NOT a fan of needing the wait staff to bring me a clean plate when I'm ready to go get more... Almost felt like begging for a new plate to be brought. My young child was pretty rowdy and it appeared as though the wait staff was annoyed because they continually offered a high chair and even at one point said "he needs a high chair." No - children this age like to climb and a high chair would have him screaming and trying to climb out/fall to the floor.<//text>< pictures>

It almost made a 4 Stars except for the following.:  1.  The  Cashier had just taken the Couple ahead of us, then she left.  She did not say sorry I'll be right back or ask someone to help take our order.  We waited and waited,  my Husband and Son wanted to leave.   Finally a Lady Manager went by and I asked for help.  Our food is served but where is our Cheese Toast.   Ask our Waiter twice no toast.   Ask the bus boy,  no toast.   Finally got it.  Ask for a container to take leftover Steak.   Never received it.   Salmon ok but a wee bit dry.  Everything else good<//Text>

They were training a new employee and she didn't really know how to use the cash register in placing the order. Even when we were specific in the order she didn't get it right. Meanwhile the steaks were made to our liking.</text>

Me And Aunts water was over worked with
4 people ...
Reason being I got the salad bar.
I had to wait 5 to 10inutes to get a plate
To go back up and re fill my plate
The food was plentiful since no patrons
It was right after the lunch crowd .so all was fresh< /text>

You order and pay before you sit to eat, and they generally only have 1 person taking the food and drink orders plus accepting cash. I enjoy the salad bar a lot!

I really like Sizzler! I know not to order the lobster because its not one of their specialty dish & its usually chewy but other than that I enjoy the food especially the salad bar. I'll take Sizzler over Hometown Buffet any day.< /Text>

Fast, friendly servers. Hot and tasty, as well as, cool and refreshing options for the salad bar. I would have given them 5 stars but they're soft serve machine was down the last time.<//Review>

First of all the young girl at the counter that took our order needs to  NOT work the register. She does not smile or look at you, she is not very hospitable or inviting to customers. She forgot one our 5 drinks. Then we had to wait for our garlic toast. My Mom's steak was hard and burnt,  we had to get up and ask for our server Everytime ! We had to ask for plates! Just very BAD</review>

< Review>
I had a horrible experience with Sizzles yesterday, I went in for a steak and lobster, my steak was just fine but my lobster was nasty and smelled really bad. At first I thought maybe it's just me but then after taking home my leftovers I realized it's was definitely something not right about that lobster. What a waste of money, time and gas. This is usually my go to place for lunch but not sure if I will be returning to this particular location.</Review>

I only give it 3 stars because the food is acceptable and and the waiters know what they're doing... The cashier's were rude and didn't charge us for what we wanted to ordered... Hope now one else experiences this kind of treatment<//text>

I have not had dinner here before so I was really confused.  Had to order right when you come in and I didn’t like that because I wasn’t sure what they had.  I felt rushed so I just picked something.  My dinner was good and filling.  I hade the steak and baked potato.  I have a hard time finding a good steak since I eat mine well done.  I usually only eat ribeye.  I didn’t try the salad bar because I felt rushed   My friend had the salad bar and everything she had looked good. Next time I will look up the menu before I go.  The waitress was nice but a little busy. We waited a while for our drinks but it wasn’t a big deal because she was trying. I will give it another try and update my review.  I looked at the menu board a little after we sat down and seen several things I would like to try.< /text>

<Review>Ever wonder what it'd be like if 7-Eleven opened a restaurant? Wonder no more, this place is basically it.

Sure my expectations were low going in... well they dropped further once my chicken sandwich arrived. A SMALL piece of fatty processed chicken on a bun. Seriously!? And not even decent processed chicken! Wow! Never again<//Review>< pictures>

Eat there on occasion . Today was worse experience of all times,  food was overcooked . Child's steak returned child even knew it was overcooked as a 5 year old . Customer service management included lacking didn't really seem concerned with our complaints .< /Review>

< Review>
The food doesn't taste so good it looks ok but once you try it the taste isn't there.  We ate there Thursday the 17th and the Banana Pudding was a cheap knock off no banana's the pudding taste cheap and tasteless the food taste is water down like the seafood salad you can tell Sizzler is on it's last leg for sure its all a matter of time.  The taste is comparable to hospital food I couldn't rate it any higher than 2 stars.</Review>

This particular location has horrible customer service based on the cashiers at the front desk. They police the patrons, and are extremely rude. It's not what you say it's how you say it. They can definitely use some positive service coaching.<//text>

The service is horrible and the food is not much better. It's serviceable if you aren't close to a sweet tomatoes. Not to mention the surrounding neighborhood isn't the best. San Leandro is doing a lot to try to revitalize their downtown but still has a ways to go.<//text>

The food was not worth $35 for 2 people just for the salad bar. Not many good tasting items either. The best thing there was the chicken soup so thank god i went there not too hungry. I just wanted to provide a place that had salads for my girlfriend and she too was not pleased.its an ok place if someone else's buying you lunch but if your looking for a great tasting meal for 35 bucks,I suggest you save it for a better restaurant. I gave the 2 stars for the chicken soup btw.</Text>

Sizzler's in San Leandro Plaza I ordered us steak and all you can eat shrimp the only problem is the state tasted funny so I sent it back then when they brought me a brand new steak and I want to cut it all the blood was just rain running out so I asked my money back it's a good place to go when you have family gatherings and stuff like that with the kids but just make sure that when you order a steak it doesn't smell four tastes funny</Review>

<Review>Tables are dirty, employee tried to get me on the clock and do some work, they didnt offer me that cheesy bread like the mexican girl did last time, no one check on us to see if our food was ok, medium steak was well done, lemonade was cloudy like ol' fish bowl water, took down ice cream machine with out notifying us and i paid for salad bar.<//Review><user>118312058844279164033< /user>< Gmap_id>

<text>Ok so it's Sizzler. Food was fine. Devon at the counter, also fine. Minor thing: asked what to drink, I responded, "water, bubbly if you have it (as a lot of fast casual places now do)." Seated at the table, I see on my receipt I was charged almost three bucks for the water. I brought the bubbly water back to Devon without touching it, saying, you know, that's kind of a lot; I'll just have tap. I'm cool about it, he's cool about it, but it was an ordeal getting my card credited. Which it never was. I was charged $37, and then $34 again.
A manager (named Cho) happened to come by and cleared my salad plate, and asked me if everything was good. I responded "No."
She asked, "No?"
I again responded, "No."
Now it got strange. She walked away, never to return. I asked Devon on the way out whether I could speak to a manager. He explained that Cho was the manager. In fact he called her the owner. I was skeptical, but asked if I could speak to her again to resolve the double charge, and he replied that she was too busy.
I left, and tried calling the restaurant on my way home to see if I could be connected with anyone who could rectify the charge. I was connected with Cho. I'll spare you the details, but the conversation was theater of the absurd, and I remain overcharged. A call to Sizzler has gotten no response.
Bottom line: food here is fine, but good luck if anything goes wrong.<//text>< pics>

This is Not the usual Sizzler salad bar they are known for ☹️ very disappointing definitely not half the size as  the one in Winton Ave. I wonder is it the same price at both places?< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I especially like this place, to the point of going almost once a week.
The cuts are good and at a great price, especially the Ryb Eye, compared to other sites.
I do not recommend the lobster, it's a very small portion.
The salad bar complies and is tasty.
They serve you very well. The bread with garlic is good good.

(Original)
Este lugar en especial me gusta bastante, al grado de ir casi una vez a la semana.
Los cortes son buenos y a muy buen precio, en especial el Ryb Eye, en comparación con otros sitios.
La langosta no la recomiendo, es una porción muy chica.
La barra de ensaladas cumple y es sabrosa.
Te atienden muy bien. El pan con ajo es bueno bueno.< /text>

(Translated by Google) The salad bar is perfect but if you want to eat meat I do not recommend it to you it is very hard whether the medium or fully stitched pudas is very hard it looks like old meat, long frozen

(Original)
La barra de ensaladas esta perfecta pero si quieres comer carne  no te la recomiendo esta muy dura ya sea que la pudas termino medio o totalmente cosida esta muy dura  parece carne vieja, de mucho tiempo  congelada<//Review>
