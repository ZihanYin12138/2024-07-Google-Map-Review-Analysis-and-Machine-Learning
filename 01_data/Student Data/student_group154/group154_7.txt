English is not my first language, but the people here were all friendly. I bought a gun and a lot of parts and they helped me put it together and the gun looked really cool. I even went to the range to try it out and it was perfectly fine. I suggest you find out what you want to buy before you come to the store. I couldn't remember the names of the guns and parts, so I showed them the pictures I had prepared and they found what I wanted very quickly. Tell them how much money you have is also very helpful.< /review>

I chose to buy my first airsoft gun at this store and was very unhappy with the customer service I received. The employees helping me were rushing me but I remained friendly. I lost all respect when the manager told me “Hurry, I want to go home” during checkout. He even threw the receipt I had to sign. I would not recommend anyone to shop here.

After researching online for what I specifically was looking for, I've came here to purchase my first airsoft pistol and other complementary products and parts along with it. The owner answered all my questions and was pretty helpful.<//Review>

All I’m going to say was that the asian guy that probably runs that store is quite rude and impatient while his employees interact with the customers 100 times better than he does. I’m not those people that are so sensitive about this but it surprises me how his employees handle with their guest better than the actual owner of that store. The asian guy probably had a bad day, who knows but I appreciate the employees that helped me</Review>

This is a good store but i can’t stand that it is closed on sunday’s. i was playing yesterday when someone dropped my handgun and i want to get it fixed. i’ve been looking around for other airsoft stores but they are all closed too. the store has good stuff but it is pricy and the staff is usually nice. i come here because it is local and has the things i’m looking for.< /Text>

We only played on one of their two fields, "The Arena" (outdoor). It was the best and most thrilling airsoft experience we've  played yet ! There was never a doll moment because  of their scenarios games. The staffs was perfessional and fair and the vibe was chill with good humble players. Airsoft extreme was stocked with everything you need and want for airsofting. We're satisfied !<//review>

Really didn't want to write this review but after a number of incidents I wanted to share my thoughts. I'm new to airsoft. My teenage son was interested so we both went in in July and bought two guns, batteries, and accessories. The owner was very helpful. He explained everything, spent a lot of time answering questions, and even gave us 10% off even though the sale had already ended. But since then we've had a number of issues.

1) In August, we bought a backup battery for each gun. The salesperson sold us the wrong batteries. When we returned them (1 week later) we were charged a restocking fee even though it was their fault.

2) My son called the store to find out if they had a pistol he wanted, they confirmed it was in stock. When we arrived the salesperson was very brusque and unfriendly. He was adamant they they did not have that gun. We even asked him to check in the back since we had called. He said he was sure. Come to find out he was mistaken. This was after we drove more than 30 minutes each way. I tried to call and talk to the owner since that was really inconvenient and I wanted to ensure the gun was in stock before driving down again. He would not talk with me. When I arrived in person and bought the gun the next day, I tried to talk to him again, he refused to talk.

3) One of the original batteries I bought was used three times and then went bad. The salesperson was nice but firm. Nothing they could do. No warranty (except 7 days).

I really wanted to like this store since it is local (30 miles away). Also I always prefer to support local vendors. But after these situations, I've decided that we will use online vendors for products. Better customer service and better warranties.< /review>

Played here last week. Really cool shop and workers. Not sure why so many complain - maybe they're just salty by nature? Manager was really nice and made rounds to ask if we had any questions even though he was handling multiple customers.

Good prices in the shop and online. Rental guns are solid and the process to get playing is super streamlined. Played for two hours with rentals and feel like I got more than I payed for!

They take safety seriously so don't run in there guns loaded :)< /Review>

Customer service : God awful. Seriously, do not come here if you need parts or accessories without knowing EXACTLY what you need. Staff will sell you things that do not work with what you have or are asking for without knowing if it really does work. Employees were both rude and lethargic.

Actual inventory there? Pretty ok. Know what you exactly want.

Also P.S. This review is not spam. I've been to AEX multiple times. The owner likes to disregard any criticism in the reviews as spam, which adds to the negative customer service experience. AEX is lucky to be one of the few airsoft stores in the area. Order online or use this place as a last resort.<//text>

I Read online reviews after I bought an AEG.  I was kind of nervous at first.  The gun came less than 48hrs later.  I love it.  I usually shop at another online store.  But now I’m all Airsoftextreme.  Greatest online experience ever.</text>

They have very great products, but I have bought  3 magazines for a Beretta mod 92fs and they seem very cheap for costing 20/30$. I was just trying to unscrew the co2 valve to remove a old co2 cartridge and it stripped The Allen key and the bottom of the mag and broke my tool I use to remove them. It is still a good store I’m just not going to buy anymore mags from them. Quite literally everything also has scratches out of the sealed box as well as I found a broken bb in my hop up on the day of purchase. They claim to never have shot a single round out of the “new guns” but idk. Kinda disappointed. Hi capas are very good though. Those are working very well.<//Review>

<Review>Has good products and pretty decent employees, but every time I’ve ever been there the manager/owner, has been absolutely horrible, either he yells at his workers or he yells at his customers and makes snide remarks, it’s very clear that if you are new to the hobby, this is absolutely not the store for you (I’ve been playing on and off since I was 16)

Had a face covering, followed all directions possible, even waited by the door for someone to help me. also not just speaking about this one experience, overall this store has a very cold vibe.<//Review><Time>1589510216127</Time><pics>None</pics>< user>

Nice and all, but the refs are touchy-touchy with your stuff and one almost dropped one of my guns and broke it, and another started to shoot mine (wasting co2). Owner wasn’t that great too,   and he’ll say this is spam since he can’t take having his feelings hurt.</Text>

The staff are great, really nice people know their airsoft.
There refs tho, loveee to touch your stuff. One time my gun was laying on the table across the room unattended not even in the playing field, and this “ref” decides to come over to it and just put his hands all over it. Saying, oh why is there a magazine in, it could go off. First off guns don’t fire when there’s no one touching it, second I don’t even own a battery to put in the gun, and third safety is on. Why do people think that they have authority over touching peoples stuff when they’re refs. Its sad.
Other than that, like I said, staff is great, nice and know their stuff.<//text>

<Review>AEX is my go to for all my airsoft needs, the times i’ve gone here and had any less than a perfect experience had nothing to do with the staff and owner, but them dealing with tech issues/internet connectivity dropping in and out on their POS system, yet they manage to get through and handle their customers.
I’ll be going to this place for as long as it stands, they’re great people, the staff does whatever possible to satisfy as far as i’ve seen, and i visit this store a few times biweekly. Keep up the amazing work guys! -Kahari<//Review>< Pics>

I believe Derek helped me out choose my first TM Hi-Capa 5.1 He is one of the best examples of customer service. He explained the pros and cons and upgrades. This made me feel comfortable with the purchase since he knew it is a product he can trust. So far, I appreciate the time they took out of his day to explain everything.

To the rest of the staff, you are all awesome and keep up the good work 🤘🏼<//text>

Very unhappy with this store. I spent $175 on a gun and when I got home it didn't even work. Took it back the next day and their tech messed with it for a minute and said I have to send it to KWA. I shouldn't have to do anything  they should. Upon getting it back from their tech I noticed he broke something on the clip. It's been 4 days now and no ones gotten back to me. I just want them to do what's right and give me a different gun that actually works. I give this company a -10 rating and they will be hearing from my lawyer real soon< /Text>

<text>My all time favorite Airsoft field, I been coming here for more than 6 years, never had any issue. The staff they have here are friendly, helpful and professional. They always treat their customers with respect.

Also they have a decent amount of product collection with fair price. During holidays they always have discounts, even on the high end product.

I witnessed the continuous improvement of their field and services throughout those years. After coming here on almost every Saturday for many years. I think now is a good time to leave a 5 stars review for them.

Keep up the good work and good luck to your business!

Took my gun here 2 times and got charged two times to fix it and the gun worked for like 2 mins and then didn't work again so the problem was never fixed. Never should have been charged and quite frankly should have just told me to buy a new aeg since they clearly couldn't fix it. I had to spend hours in traffic for that.<//review>

Copy and pasted from my yelp review. Just trying to give this place a better review as I think they’ve been doing pretty good but here it is.

I waited a couple months before doing this review for a couple reasons. Mainly to remove the bias of a single bad interaction or a single bad day on the field. Needless to say I don't think I've actually had any bad interactions or days at their field. I came in a couple times to view their merchandise and ask about certain rifles and how they compared to others, which ones they recommend and why. They gave me more information than I expected to receive. I would also call and ask a lot of questions over the phone and every time I called the other person on the phone gave me great information as well.  They aren't the biggest airsoft store I've ever been to but the staff there is very friendly and open and they do have a fairly large selection to choose from.

Playing in their cqb arena is loads of fun too. It is a little small and there are a couple areas where it feels like one side will always have an advantage over the other team but overall it is fun field to play. They have a variety of game modes they cycle through and they listen to the players when they want to play a specific one. I used their rental guns the first two times I played before bringing in my own load out. The rentals aren't too bad. Sure the rifles and magazines they give you are a little dented or scratched but they do work fine and are actually fairly accurate. They also give you knee pads, gloves, and a full face mask, basically all the essentials you need to have fun and be safe. The Refs are fairly nice and give you 5-10 minute breaks between games to gear up and get ready for the next one. Every game I've been to also had very nice players with few if any being toxic or mean.

Overall I am very impressed with Airsoft Extreme and would recommend anyone looking into starting airsoft or someone who needs to find upgrades for their gear and guns to come by and see what they have to offer.</review>

<text>Friendly staff and good service. Decent selection of airsoft guns, parts and gear if you're looking to purchase. Though the Field is fun and fast paced, its on the smaller end with limited field variation. You can still spend an entire day there and still have a good time.< /text><Rate>5</Rate><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><user_name>Tu Bui<//user_name><date>1522655266975< /date><user>102016946744599029751<//user>< gmapID>

<Text>Im new to airsoft and was in the area so I figured Id check this place out. Walked in and its a very quite vibe to the place. Both of the staff were quite and did ask if I needed help. I asked to check out a few airsoft pistols. I made a comment on one of the guns appearing "Cheaply made". The older asian worker there took offense to my comment and told me that I "Know nothing about airsoft". I continued to walk around for 5 minutes and simply left.  Waste of my time. He should fix his tune and realize customers do not appreciate engaging with a rude sfaff member.  I was planning on buying an airsoft pistol worth $170, but will not support a rude business. Do not waste your time here. Clearly he isnt very welcoming of new ppl to this hobby.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I'm new to the sport/hobby of Airsoft. I've been to both Prime Airsoft and here. I will not compare the both and I will tell you my experience here. The store is a beautiful store and the lady didnt come off rude to me, but she is a more to the point type person if you know what I mean, she is very straight forward I guess . Very helpful, I bought a couple batteries here. This will be my go to store if I don't want to deal with Shipping Online. More inventory than Prime Airsoft</Text>

I went in there to check some new product and ask them how to operate with that product. And they gave me a blue face already. And, I asked to feel the weight of the airsoft gun. An Asian guy said "Are you going to buy that gun? I cannot let you touch it if you are not going buy it! This gun is really expensive. So, if you are not going to buy it then I cannot let you touch it cause this is a really expensive gun." He repeated twice. And I totally feeling insult. I go there by reading the review from google and turns out it is so difference from the review.👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻< /text>

<Review>Too much trash, yea to be more specific i was told a owner called peter was actin up and wasted my friend's time. pretty sure it was same peter guy who gave another reviewer by the name zelon leung a hard time too, zelong over here talkin bout how ''An Asian guy said'' Are you going to buy that gun? I cannot let you touch it if you are not going buy it!''etc etc. so there's that and the others who have same issue with customer service. does that answer your question? and stop calling bad reviews spam. its all real experiences.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1557339247099, 'text': "Care to be more specific because we'd be happy to address the issue?

<Text>Great store however the manager and a few other workers seem to be less than helpful and know bare minimal about airsoft and try to make sales. They argue most of the time I'm there, and have zero people skills. I come here every month and buy something. There seem to be new hires that are very polite and respectful for shoppers. They got great amount of items and a nice clean store. I'd give it A 5 star but the boss and other asain guy need to leave they are more in the way than helpful.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

I am new to the game and have been able to learn allot from the them. They are a very accommodating group. Even though I didn't purchase my rifle there they made great effort to help me with a problem I was having with it, using their own BB's and at no charge. I also bought a sling hook there and they installed it at for free. Another cool aspect is the you can test fire any gun in the store. I will now be purchasing my guns at Airsoft Extreme!

Did not get the chance to play on the field yet. However it appears a rather simple parking lot field. But they do have a Friday early evening special that might make it all worth it. Will check it out in the very near future.< /text>

Very disappointed with this place!
Recently just bought gear here to start up my new addictive hobby and after spending $400 on goods here, they would not let me return items.  There return policy is 7 days and it todo days world this is painfull number.  I will go back to buying online were I have had better prices than here and better return policies for the future.  If only I could make a return to prove my point!</text>

< Review>
Used their online store.  Service was terrible.  We paid $20 extra for Postal service rather than UPS.  We needed Postal.  They sent it UPS anyway and cost us $60 in fees.  They wouldn't admit their mistake even though the order form was clearly readable for them and us, wouldn't cover the costs they incurred by not following our instructions, and wouldn't even credit the extra $20 we paid for postal service when they used UPS, which was cheaper for them.  I explained our situation thoroughly, asked that they fix it, wasn't even rude to them and they simply refused to help.  like i said, they didn't even credit us the higher priced shipping that they didn't provide.  Offered $10  That kind of stupid greed will cost them in the end.  Stay away and patronize better people out there.<//Review>

<text>This is surely the best airsoft pro shop in the Bay Area.   They have a great store with plenty of  high quality guns well as gear. The prices seem comparable to online and they have a friendly tech and a firing range to test the guns. Everyone working in the store is an airsoft enthusiast so there is lots of knowledge.  There is also a great little CQB field at the back of the store which gets busy on Saturdays. When we had problems with things we bought there they were very cool about returning them or getting them fixed.Yes, there are some personalities in this store but once you get to know them you will love this place.< /text>< response>

It was not great, went there with my friend for his birthday and i brought my own gun. I had 5 batteries and one was a really weak battery that shot 345 fps and the guy said it shot over 400 which my gun shoots 460 fps with the strongest battery i have and when i went to have another worker test it for me he said it was just fine (also the person that checked my gun first was hostile and mean but the second person that checked my gun was extreamly nice) also i used my own drum mag and scope and the first person who checked my fps looked at it and said you cannot use your own equipment if its a rwntal but it never daid anything about it but it was fun met nice people but i would recomment going to GamePod Cambat Zone</review>

<text>So this isn't my local store but it is very close to my family's house so I go here whenever I'm in town and I really love this store, it's a step up above the Sacramento store because of the field and larger selection of items and the staff are very, very helpful. I brought in my gbb pistol near the end of the day and they just decided to fix it and only charge me for the part which I was very happy with. I also purchased some MBUS sights and they installed them for me which I also really appreciated. I haven't gotten to use the field yet but on my next visit I probably will. They have a very large selection of Tactical gear, accessories, and replacement parts instead of just guns like some other stores. Their prices are not bad at all and I ended up walking out with a bag of accessories (along with the fixed pistol) for just $50 dollars. Very nice store and I just love going to it when I'm in San Jose/Santa Clara.<//text>< pics>

I was looking for a unique party idea for my son's 12th birthday and AEX came through.  It was our first time there and we were a bit disorganized and the staff helped us get onto the field.  The rangemaster Boyd made the game time fun, the boys played in with older boys and adults and everyone played well, it was a fun day and six boys plays all day for around $100.   We now go one weekend a month for some team playing.</Text>

The employees are extremely rude, barely fix your gun even if you rush it, take your money and lie to you, dont even bother going there. And continuing I sent my gun in there to be fix in early December and asked if they could just assemble the gun back together, easy fix right? So anyways after the first 2 weeks of no call I call they and see how it is going, and they said "Oh sorry your gun keeps being pushed back from all these Christmas sales, and the techs have no time." I was completely understanding, but by week 3 I was getting a little mad because why would they push me back when I clearly came before everybody else, so I called in and they said my gun was behind 5 guns to be fixed, but this time there were 15 GUNS ahead of me! So I keeping calling them everyday and asking why would you push my gun if I came first? And all they said there back tracked and under staffed. Thats is a crap response to this question.< /Review>

Play is fun pretty small field but makes it more interesting no engagement distance not like the fields in SoCal where everyone cries if you shoot within 10 feet and dont yell bang bang. No one complained if people dont call their hits just shoot them more and in the face they will call it when they get 6 or 7 rounds to the face.<//Text>

It's often quiet. It's unfortunate that airsoft is struggling in some areas, but it's still loads of fun, and airsoft extreme tries their best to keep it alive. Some of the staff are awkward, but as airsoft nerds, they're kind and relatable.< /Review>

Disclaimer: First time playing airsoft.

I really liked this place. The store personnel were very friendly and accommodating to us first timers (although some of the veterans in the store were laughing at our need to review the operations of the simple Sig pistol). The course is super small and is basically a parking lot converted into an airsoft course with makeshift barriers of barrels and plywood. It's good for quick team deathmatch rounds and the occasional capture the flag. The weekend ref (forgetting his name) and his son Bear were the highlight of our day. Both were super cool and accommodating and worked to keep the teams even and fair, while keeping things fun and informative.

Competitive prices (was shamelessly cross-shopping Amazon in the store), cool people, easy going atmosphere and noob friendly. I'd come back for sure.</Text>

< Review>
I was rather disappointed in the professionalize of the staff. My brother and I entered the store in hopes to purchase an airsoft gun, but rather we were met with a cold atmosphere. Personally my brother and I have been playing airsoft for roughly ten years, so we are very familiar with the sport. For some reason the staff at Airsoft Extreme were very unprofessional, we were offered little to no help and when questions were asked the simply shuffled into the back of the store and would come back with out uttering a word. Most of the time my brother and I were in the store the staff mainly hung out in the back of the store chatting away or shooting their guns. Mostly leaving the store to us to wonder around in. If you wish to get in to airsoft avoid the troubles of this store, they are not worth your time.<//Review>

< Review>
Honestly first time being there as a customer it was great, sales representatives are quick and very professional. My girlfriend buying her first gun, it seems that they sold her a defective gun. I don't know if I should've suspected something but I can tell you that prime airsoft does a better job at selling you a gun before you pay for it. Also there's one sales representative who doesn't know what she's talking about. I told her about a krytac SPR and she tells me that it's an standard M4 with little to no upgrades out of the box. To my surprise that discourage me about her knowledge of airsoft guns, other places I've gone to seem to give excellent opinions about the gun. The gun my girlfriend bought seems to have an off set crane stock which its tilted to the right a little. Also when trying to adjust the hop up on it, the charging handle seem to broke off the spring. We did take it back and they did fix it, but in my honest opinion I feel they sold her a gun that was a rental because they're are a few scrapes here and there and the gun just doesn't feel as sturdy as the one they had on display. If it's your first time shopping here, be a little cautious to what you buy and compare other places to find better deals on a more solid weapon or gear than buying something that could be defective or broken.<//Review>

<Text>Airsoft Extreme was unfriendly to me, but I must assume that if you are "in the club" then the store might have something to offer you. By that, I mean that if you are a regular at the store or know airsoft inside and out and can immediately be identified as one of their own and be accepted into the herd, then the store will likely have something to offer you. But if you are new to the game, or are thinking of learning more, this is NOT the store for you. I am completely new to airsoft, but have been paintballing and own a personal protection firearm, so I'm comfortable around gun and sporting shops. But walking into Airsoft Extreme was like walking into a comic book store in the 80s. Dark, cramped, unfriendly and with a vibe of hostility if you are perceived as an outsider.

I visited the local San Jose airsoft stores in hopes of seeing some of the guns in person and ask some questions. This was my first stop. I visited with the store with my family.

I stood near the counter, showing interest in the pistols on display and no one on staff engaged me to see if I needed help. I eventually looked around the shop a bit and returned to the case where I had to get someone's attention and ask to see a spring model. No conversation, he just brought up the gun I asked to see and stood there while I looked it over. I don't even think he made eye contact with me.
I asked to see one more pistol and got the same silent treatment. And I know they do talk because there were conversations going on all around me with customers who were obviously regulars.

We eventually left and looked elsewhere. Overall, a very unpleasant experience .<//Text>< pictures>

Staff were impolite and rude. Reviews have been talking about this one girl, who is hostile. I agree, she was rude, and so were other staff members. Small playing field. We used airsoft rentals, and were not in the best of shape. Won't go there again.<//Text>

I've purchased several airsoft guns from this particular store and everyone of them has broken. I've also taken one of them to get repaired, and it broke several days later. When I asked a salesman if a silencer would fit on a styer Aug, they said yes and I had to heavily modify the gun to get it to fit. I will never shop here again.< /Text>

<Review>Beverly Vapez, hands down the best smoke shop in LA. They have a huge selection of amazing disposables flavors, cigarettes, & cigars, e-liquid vape juices, devices & device accessories, nice & fancy hookah's, glass bongs, plastic bongs, glass pipes, koi products, EXOTICBLVD snacks and drinks & a lot more good quality products. If you're stuck finding a product the helpful owner & manager will gladly do their best to find the product and give an amazing deal! I will never go to another smoke shop while BV is in business!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Always amazing service!! Always go out of their way to make sure I get want I need! If they don't have it in stock they order it for me ASAP and even call me to let me know it's ready!!! Highly recommend The Vape Shop for all your vape needs! The points system is an even better incentive to continue going!</review>

<Text>This place is really nice man. Thank you very much for it all folks seriously..  I mean when you got hip customer service coupled with all that you can possibly need from a vap shop and reasonable prices, you make it a habit to go back there.. I've been there several times in the past month and I would definitely recommend checking this place out. oh ya the place looks freaking awesome too.. cheers<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I gave the shop a call explaining to the manager “Chris” that I had a bad reaction to the Reds Apple Juice 6mg!

Explaining to him that after only 1 day I caught a fever and starting throwing up at work! It could have been a bad reaction or a bad batch!

But I understand with goods like this I did not expect a refund, only to exchange it so I did not throw away $26 on something that poisoned me.

Chris simply stated “THATS NOT THERE PROBLEM”  but he could over me 20% off my next purchase.

DO NOT SHOP HERE! Do not waist your time or money!

Also all products in this store can be found Online for $10-$15<//Review>

These guys are the best in the business, every vape shop makes you deal with problems with mods, tanks, juices, etc. directly with the company. These guys went out of their way to help me with my defective Arms race mod and gave me a loaner vape free of charge, handled everything with limitless mod co on their end and sent me a brand new device in the mail. Definitely recommend!</Text>

What I was trying to say is that it might not be there problem, it might be that you are allergic to certain ingredients in certain e-juices. I told you to consult your doctor/physician first before trying out anymore ejuice to see if you are allergic to something. I was fine with switching out the same ejuice and for a future purchase offer you a 20% discount. I sincerely applogize for the inconvenience.< /Text>< Resp>

<Review>I can't say enough!!

I am visiting from NYC and after waking this morning to find that my eLeaf iStick took an unfortunate fall to the ground overnight, I popped into Beverly Vapes to get a replacement.  After listening to where I was in the process of vaping, what I liked and what I thought I wanted, Kris and Aris walked me through some possibilities.  For starters, I ended up with a Sigelei mini and a Kangertech subtank mini to use 'on the go' which I am very happy with.

I felt so comfortable that I decided to venture into a conversation about dripping . . . which for me has always been daunting and previously had just left it alone.  Long story short, Kris spent a great deal of attention setting up my first rebuildable, guiding me through every step process and answering all my questions.

Excellent visit with staff who know their products and Listen to their Customers!!  I highly recommend!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><user>105245543410683997588< /user><resp>None</resp><time>1428631150760</time><username>Erin Joy Savola< /username>< rating>

Okay,
I have been to many vape shops, but not one remotely like this. The first time I came in, after grueling the worker with numerous phone calls regarding the purchase that I wanted to make, I was greeted by a respectful and cheerful employee named Kris. He was ready to help me with whatever it was that i hoped and desired, while giving me his undivided attention.

The first thing I noticed when I walked into the shop, was their HUGE selection of E-Juices that varied in flavor, size and nicotine level. Plus they let you sample whatever juice you want, to ensure satisfaction.

There is a chill ambiance in the store, that welcomes everyone 18+ from people just starting to vape to "veteran vapers." This store is also very helpful to people that are trying to quit smoking.

Another thing that's is this shop is a "vape shop." It is not a head shop that sells pipes and bongs and and other smoking accessories, this is effective because this enables them to have a vast selection of vape stuff. I appreciate the separation because this is really the way it should be. Vaping should not be associated with smoking in my opinion.

Who loves discounts, I DO! And apparently Beverly Vapes does too! There is a special discount every day with catchy names like: "TWOs Day special" and "Thirsty Thursday" (which is my favorite because it's buy 2 juices get one free!!!)

Overall I highly highly recommend this shop. People that go to any other one are really missing out.

And remember, "It's vapor not smoke." :)

<Review>I was referred to Beverly Vapes by a friend who convinced me to switch to vaping recently. This is the spot to be! Employees are extremely knowledgeable, respectful and considerate. Not only is this place modern and hip but they also have exclusive mods and accessories that I have never seen before elsewhere.

Beverly Vapes isn't the closest vape shop to me but I'd prefer to go a little out of my way and get all my necessities there!

You guys keep doin' what you're doin! I'll see you soon.< /Review>< pictures>

This is a great place to go the hobos living in the park are usually friendly addicts not too hostile, not too many needles in the grass and sandbox some nice shade to cool off in there is an empty police station there that doubles as a toilet I often see people taking dumps there, I personally would not bring kids here but if you have no where to go its rent free</Text>

<text>The children's play area has lots of fun equipment, such as swings, slides and a water feature. The park sits next to a fire station and a community center. You do need to keep the kids close and keep an eye out for trouble makers, including small kids with potty mouths. There is plenty of shade and room to kick a ball around. You'll need to be vigilant here, since not so nice people like to collect there too.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Lots of homeless people at the back of the park. Appeared to be drug active going on which gave me an unsettling feeling. I'd go elsewhere.<//Review>

I was skeptical at first based on the other reviews but I had a wonderful experience and found it was overall a great deal! They arrived right on time, the driver helped with my luggage, had excellent on board communication, and the car was clean. Driver was very friendly, helpful and drove well. I highly recommend and will be using this again.</Text>

<review>Don't use. Turned up over 20 min late. No apologies. Drove around downtown SF for ages trying to find route to freeway. There is a reason why their rating is so low. Shame our hotel booked them and shame we didn't check. Lesson learnt....<//review>< Date>

I asked for this reservation to be completely canceled and have a refund of $31 in June for a July trip.

I then called in June for a cancellation and spoke with a woman and she said that she would completely cancel the whole reservation and I will get a refund.

I never received a refund of $31 so I was charged for something that I did not use. I never came to California.  I reviewed my bank statement.

I expect good customer service and follow through… If I’m being told I get a refund I need a refund.
Airport Express please give me a refund to address this immediately.  Thank you.<//text>

<Review>Lied about everything.  Loaded van and departed only to drive around and go back to pick up more passengers.  I had been specifically told that wouldn’t happen.  Guaranteed 30 minute trip to hotel took 1.5 hours.  Absolutely don’t recommend.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Do not book with this company if you care about safety. One van swerved into my lane with no warning after being double parked on the other side of the street, then kept coming toward me even after I used my horn as warning. They came within an inch of taking off my mirror. I would have hated to be in the shuttle and see my van almost run another vehicle into a parked car.

Since the manager hasn’t called me after I attempted to report the incident, I feel this is the best place to recommend ANYONE besides this company. So unsafe. Do not use.</review><Date>1540536160597< /Date>< user_id>

<text>Was picked up from the airport went to put my bags in the back of the van I was told to leave them he would do that and told me to board.  I was the last stop when I went to get my bags one was missing. Was told he would go and find it at some of the other passengers help themselves to the bags. Called the hotline no one really cared told me a manager would get in contact with me didn't happen. When I called the police found they had the luggage however airport express refuse to go and pick it up telling me that I didn't watch for my luggage. Unbelievably poor service rude staff from the phone. Losing one of your customers bags certainly should be something that is escalated to management. Cost me $19 would have payed $40 with Uber.

The bag was curbside and the driver failed to put it in the van.  This was not left in the terminal but left beside the van.<//text><Gmap_id>0x808580806e7b738d:0x51fb1e70661b5a2c< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The shuttle showed up on time, got us to and from the airport quickly and was reliable. The driver didn't speak a lot of English, but we were just looking for a ride, not a guided tour. No issues or complaints, the service was exactly as expected and requested. The driver drove responsibly and didn't scare us or anything. Our return trip to the airport was smooth as well.</Text>

<text>Terrible service. I was picked up from the hotel 25 minutes later than expected, the tracking system didn’t work and there was no notification that the shuttle was running late. I had prepaid for the service, including paying extra for gratuity because I was leaving the country and didn’t want to carry around American cash. When I got to the terminal the driver required me to produce a receipt as his form said I had not yet paid (no problem- I had the email) but then he tried to bully me into providing a larger tip. Book with a different company.< /text></record>

<Review>Very bad, coming late with no apologies, the hostel I stayed need to keep calling to check with them, and the driver was very rude, pushed me while loading the baggage to the car and pushed me again to go inside car. If you really want to use the service, better spare more time and book the time 3/4 hrs before your flight if you are taking domestic flights to allow them to come late and traffic.< /Review><rate>1< /rate></record>

My shuttle was at 1.45pm 30/5/2019 from the zephyr hotel, I got picked up on time, the driver looked like he couldn't be bothered being at work, literally threw everyone's bags in the back of the van, asking rudely who were are flying with, once we get to the airport, everyone pays the man with cash, I say I need to pay card, he gets out his phone, almost demanding my credit card, i asked to see the transaction details as I'm not about to just hand over my card, he was very rude acting like I had an issue, I said to him there is no need to be rude, he replied saying he is giving customer service, he has no clue what customer  service is, the worst person possible for this job! I had 2 other people waiting with me who I didn't even know to make sure everything was ok, that was actually really nice of them, anyway i paid, but you need to have better drivers or re train them, that man was horrible and no service at all.
I would never recommend going with this shuttle company, absolute disgrace.</Text>

<text>My girlfriend and I were picked up from a terrible hostel in foul moods. Our driver (Scott) was about 20 Minutes earlier than anticipated, drove very safely, was hilarious and even gave us some advice on not letting the  terrible quality of our hostel ruin the rest of our trip.  My only regret was that we were misinformed on payment methods and only took out enough money from an ATM to pay the fare. Because of this we didn't have any tip money for Scott (who deserved a generous one!).  Overall I can genuinely say that this is one of the most stress-free parts of our trip. If the rest of the drivers of this company are half as good as Scott then you're in great hands!<//text>< pictures>

Waited around 25 minutes for Van at airport.
When I called I was informed Driver was there.  Lie #1. Informed them driver was not there. 2nd time I called.  I was informed.  Driver just missed me and would loop back around. Lie 2. Third time I called.  I was informed driver stopped for gas. After another 4  to 5 munutes another van showed up. He was a replacement driver. He said he has no idea what happened to my driver. Don't comain to him. He is just a driver.
Lousy service.<//Text>

I hired Airport Express to drive me from the San Francisco airport to my hotel in San Francisco and it was a nightmare.  The driver was a tall black guy named Marvin, drove like a maniac.  He was speeding and making fast lane changes w/o using turn signals, he cut-off other drivers, honked and cursed at them, and ran a red light.

He took corners very fast and our luggage in the back slid from one side to the other.  The whole time, he was eating peanuts and driving with one hand while dumping the peanuts from a small package into his mouth, taking his eyes off the road.  He seemed very angry and bent on upsetting myself and the other passengers.

The seat belts did not work and when another passenger complained to him about this, he said he never sat in the back so he didn't know.  When I asked him to slow down, he said curtly, "I have been driving this way for 24 f.......ing years and no one is going to tell me how to drive.  He then started driving even faster.

When he let out an elderly couple before my stop, the man complained about his driving and he cursed them out.  I don't know if he was on drugs or just angry but something was wrong with this guy.

When I finally got to the hotel, I called and complained and the person I spoke to said another passenger had complained also.  There are numerous other shuttle companies that you can hire from the airport and I would certainly avoid Airport Express shuttle.</Review>

Booked this shuttle via a hostel I stayed at. The shuttle was already 20min late when it arrived, but there were 5 additional stops afterwards, so I got to the airport 45min later than expected by the hostel staff/claimed arrival time. There were other people in the shuttle that waited 1,5 hours for their pick-up already. The driver seemed overworked and was being rude. I would never ever book this shuttle again. If you really want to save a little bit of money and use this service, book it for an hour before you actually need it. I would recommend to stay away from it though.</Review>

Don't ever ever book with these rude & incompetent idiots. They left my 18 year old son stranded at San Fran Bus Depot travelling to Airport to get flight home to Australia for Xmas. They could not be bothered to pick him up after I paid online with the booking being confirmed by email and by phone. (I booked online from Australia) Money grabbers with no service. They should be shut down. Tried to rate them Zero Stars but would not let me post, so had to give them one star. Next a formal written complaint to governing body in San Fran< /text>

< Review>
This is the shuttle service Green Tortoise Hostel uses to get people to the airport. I was promised a low price and to actually get there on time. Against my better judgement, I didn't refuse the booking at the Hostel's desk when I was told I should book a service an entire hour before I'd actually need it.

I never caught the shuttle I booked. a 5 minute delay became 10, then 20. At this point, I noticed other tourists packing their stuff into an Uber. So I paid part of their Uber fare and went in that car instead. Traffic wasn't exceptionally heavy, no obvious car crashes or anything to slow them down. The shuttle service is just sloppy. Never again.< /Review>

<Text>Calling for service was absolutely terrible. I paid for my ride over the phone and they couldn't even send me  a confirmation receipt of my payment via email. I called over 5 times and spoke to several different representatives and none of them were capable of sending a receipt. The last time I called, I spoke to another representative who claimed that he could not help me, no other employers worked there, and then he hung up on me. The worst service I've ever experienced. If you could even call that service. I had to cancel my transaction.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Unfortunately my experience with Airport Express was horrible. Our hotel offered a special rate through them so we made a reservation a few days before our arrival at SFO. We called again when we arrived and spoke with Carmella four different times as we waited over 40 minutes for the shuttle to arrive. We were promised over and over that the shuttle was 5-10 minutes away and we did see it drive by in the far lanes at one point. We tried to wave it over but the driver waved back and didn't stop. We eventually took another shuttle service.  When we made reservations through our hotel for our return trip to the airport we hoped for a better experience but yet again, Airport Express let us down. We were waiting for an 11am shuttle and waited from 10:50am until 11:35. Our hotel called the shuttle multiple times and was told they were ten minutes away each time. We ended up calling an Uber so we wouldn't miss our flight. Shame on you Airport Express. If you're not coming, you should just say so - don't mislead customers and keep saying ten minutes when you have no intention of coming.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

DO NOT TAKE THIS SHUTTLE! The shuttle was supposed to pick me up at 4:15 am and they arrived 15 minutes late, almost causing me to miss my flight. The driver was grumpy and extremely rude to all passengers, it was like he hated his job and was mad at everyone just for being there, he made no effort at customer service. They also charged me $4 higher than what I was supposed to pay-the hostel I stayed at had a deal with them but she said I had to pay more just because I booked it by the phone. Horrible company with awful service, uber would have been a lot better. I almost gave up on waiting and was about to call an uber but the hostel called and they said they were 2 minutes away, finally 10 minutes later they arrived and still made like 5 more stops to pick people up.< /Text>

<Text>Pick up from Airport catastrophe... they should include the imformation that you have to call them once you are there again in the email confirmation, it only says on website before you book, so I ended up waiting over an hour. Dont get why you have to provide your flight number if nobody does anything before you call... anyhow when the driver arrived 20minutes after my call, we were half way gone and then called back again, wrong Terminal noone there.. seemed all very unorganized. However the way back was perfect, on time even though traffic was bad.<//Text>< Pics>

Arrived got our bags, went to airport shared shuttle service. Called company said we are here with bags ready. Oh we have none of our vans at the airport. Well I had a booking i paid you $60 in advance you knew my number my flight number what time we arrived why are you not here?
Told us to walk to court yard 4 which is one hell of a trek with all your bags after a long flight. Said something to do with need permission to drive onto the arrivals floor?! Erm well your'e an airport shuttle company you should have already had this all arranged. We landed over a hour ago and still waiting in the cold now. Not impressed would not use this company again.</review>

Nightmarish experience with the airport shuttle driver. He was incredibly rude, tossed my suitcase into the back of the van, slammed the doors, and drove to the next pickup point where I overheard another passenger say to him, "Lose your attitude." He drove like a maniac to the airport. Bu the time I arrived I was frazzled. Never again would I choose this company to shuttle me anywhere!< /review>

<Review>The driver of the "Airport Express San Francisco" was extremely rude and moody, he pulled a hand bag from a friend to put in the trunk without her wanted, spoke loudly, banged the door violently and drived honking. Also, it changed the way to pick up the phone that was forgotten in the company.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808580806e7b738d:0x51fb1e70661b5a2c< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) The vans are working at full capacity. This means that you may have to travel to 4-5 more stations, which means 30-45 minutes of additional travel time. For two people it's about half the price of a taxi. Otherwise everything ok.

(Original)
Die Vans werden voll ausgelastet. Das bedeutet dass man evtl. noch 4-5 weitere Stationen anfährt, was leicht 30-45 Minuten zusätzliche Fahrtzeit bedeutet. Für zwei Personen ist es etwa der halbe Preis wie beim Taxi. Ansonsten alles ok.</review>

Poor service @Covina,CA office. The employees including Daniel the store manager know nothing about the prices. They quote you and later apologize for making mistake on the price. I wait for almost 3 hrs to do a simple upgrade and walked out with nothing. They make up there own prices, someone needs to monitor that store.

Will be reporting to corporate offices. They loose my service.</review>

<review>The manager Jasmine has always been great. My family followed her to this store since she transferred from your Walnut brand on Grand & Valley. She’s always precise from start to finish whether we upgrade our phones, add lines, change something on our plan.. if you ever go here ask for Jasmine. I’ve also delt with Cat and she is also very nice. Highly Recommend!!!</review>< resp>

Excellent service. I was in between two phones and the staff, Kathleen, was extremely knowledgeable to give the pros and cons of each choice. I love my phone now! The service was fast, easy, and, most importantly, friendly. Thank you Kathleen!<//review>

We Came in on a Monday night around 7:50 with a bit of guilt for keeping Jasmine after closing. She was great from beginning to end, it was a bit of work considering we bought a phone, a few accessories and connect our family of 4 lines to AT&T after bad service with T-mobile. We left around 8:50. That was GREAT Customer Service. Plus she put up with me butchering her name time & time again (Sorry!)

Thank You Jasmine!</Review><UserId.>104119467844566779919<//UserId.>< date>

The customer service at this particular store in Covina is excellent. I remember the sales rep Kathleen really took the time to explain the different plans they have to offer and show my wife and I the different features of all the new cell phones. I will never shop anywhere else.</review>

<text>I got accessories at your Covina location at a great price. Jasmine greeted me at the door and I waited at most 2 minutes to be seen. She helped me add a line to my account for my mom and the process was so quick. She also makes for great conversation. For anyone that doesn’t want to go to those other stores that are so crowded and the reps just bombard you.. come here. Thank you jas & reps< /text>< pictures>

Pulled up to the store recently and jasmine was so helpful. She got me a deal on accessories and helped me with my plan. Walked out with a new iPhone X & a smile. Shout out Jasmine I believe she’s the manager.</Text>

I have reported this store to the BBB for defrauding the elderly. My dad went into this store to downgrade my mom's phone because she is struggling with technology. He mentioned he was going to purchase an Echo and was coerced in believing that it would not work without a smartphone. So he reacted her iPhone and we get a bill for $335! When I called At&T they stated they could not reverse the charge unless the store wrote a note stating the phone was activated on error. BTW I have been a loyal customer of AT&T for almost 20 years, but clearly that means NOTHING.I called and spoke to the store manager and he refused to write anything that would reverse the charges. I cancelled the service and there has been ZERO usage on the phone since activation on 6/9. AT&T will not reverse the charges unless the manager adds a note to the account...vicious circle... So if you are smart DO Not TAKE YOUR BUSINESS TO THIS STORE!.and I will be saying GOODBYE to At&T..Defrauding the elderly is a crime...< /Review>

<text>Got a steal of a deal on a dual suspension MTB. With the service plan and other offers I have been very happy so far. You can also order from the website and pick up in store.

They appear to have one of the better selections of bike gear in the area as well.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0jwubPb_pqj2cG-ZQ2fJpTvLCCEDDJn-4j-B6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfBjf9IK7yQYsgIjbgO_AI5S1-7ipXYTwp1ewW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMH3pkAIRfzpDPmMNSLZGtsWhllO5P5yIKy06s0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Great retail chain: it was sad to see my hometown San Rafael close down.  When I took a beach trip to Santa Monica, I stopped here on my walk to the beach to say ONE LAST GOODBYE:( I was truly happy to throw in a stop here for a silly pair of socks that actually came in handy at the super-wonderful close-out price. Thank you and goodbye Performance Bicycle.🌊😢🌞🏁🚴🚵🚲</Text>

<review>Big clean store with a good amount of options to pick thru. Pricing is fair. Parking is a breeze - if you go to the alley north of the building you will find the entrance for their basement parking garage with an elevator that unloads you directly into the store. Super convenient and plenty of parking.</review><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Great service, good bikes, but beware of the membership.  I signed up for it and they would not honor my points in the "closing sale". I put quotes because they advertise the store is closing to get you to come in, but it may not close. Maybe I am just upset at losing my $70 worth of points.</Review>

The best bike shop to get your bike repair, best service, best value, best deals! Oscar and Jorge are the best mechanics in Santa Monica.

This place is OK, but just OK.  They have a fair selection of bikes and the staff are generally pleasant and knowledgeable.  Prices are fair.  Their line of Performance-branded products is all cheap stuff from China.  Gets the job done, but is certainly nothing to laud about.  I got some leg warmers with zippers that are difficult and fell apart in a matter of months anyway.  Jacket had a fastex buckle improperly attached.  I went back and checked the others to possibly exchange, but they were all like that.  Salesman explained that sometimes they get a whole run of products like that.  Service shop is reasonably quick, if lacking attention to detail.  Got a bike back that ran worse after adjustments (chain continues to fall off after gear changes).  One time I got a "complete tune-up" only to have to use the bike's air pump to fill my own tires.  I go back because they're better than Bike Attack on Main and are closer than Helen's, but if you want a higher quality shop, go to Helen's.< /text>

There is a decent amount of merchandise. If you need a good mechanic look for Jorge!
Store has basic selection of bikes nothing out of the ordinary.

Loved the prices and selection but had to look for help. I've visited there 3 times...lackluster, passive salespeople. If I were the owner I'd be worried unless of course the frequent sales outshine the staff.<//Text>

<Review>Ive heard of car mechanics screwing you over if you weren't savvy with cars but I never thought bike mechanics would do the same.

I took two bikes here to get tubes replaced and minor repairs. Both bikes lasted one ride before the tubes popped or went flat from a puncture. When I took it back to be replaced they said the punctures were natural and not a function of their faulty installation and charged me again for the tubes. Now I'm not super into bikes but I have had bikes for 8 years had tubes replaced numerous times and never had this issue on a first go. Two on the first day seems even more unlikely. I would choose a different shop unless you want to get scammed. They were probably trying to upswell their super expensive bike repair warranty</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I want to give this five star credit to the manager.  I'm not sure what his name was now, but when my front tire needed serious fixing, he helped me do that so efficiently, and without the sort of self centered attitude you get from some people in some places.  And he was patient, and a leader in the situation involving a repeatedly punctured front tire due to a tire frame issue.  This is for the energy he brought to the shop.</Text>< Time>

JP is a Hero!!!! I was in a bind with a broken rear  derailer hanger. They did not have one in stock and as I was traveling I could not wait for them to order one. He let me have one off a floor model which was huge. This very generous favor allowed me to get all Sunday afternoon in riding in the Santa Monica mountains....AMAZING!!!!<//Text>

<text>This dude named Carlos provides horrible service. Should find a job he loves instead of trying to mess with people and press them to make his paycheck. Went in here with a gift card, told him I needed specific screws,  he tries to upsell me, told him no thank you. He kept on persisting. Told me I need a new this and a new that and I can't leave without a "safe seat" bull trying to make some kind of commission over helping someone that is a local. Never coming here again.<//text>< Time>

<Rating>4</Rating><Date>1375828377178<//Date><user_id>109601913522127638412<//user_id><text>Update: Just received a call from one of their employees, Justin - he was following up on my issue that I called about last week. He listened to my complaint, and was able to pull up the receipt of my purchase from where he was at. Once I explained my unwillingness to spend an hour and half on the road to claim my pedals, and after I told him I had ended up buying pedals elsewhere, he then offered to refund the money back to my credit card!

Color me pleasantly surprised - not a lot of businesses would be willing to go that extra mile to follow up on a customer complaint. Upgrading my rating to 4 stars; I'll save the 5 star for the next time I visit there when I'm in the area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only writing a review because I'm still steamed from my one and only experience visiting there today.

Purchased a set of bike pedals from there, along with a few things - only to discover that the salesperson there had not placed it in my bag when I left. Receipt in hand, I called their store to confirm that it was there, and it was; problem was, they wanted me to come back in person with the receipt to verify I owned it.

Problem: I lived an hour and a half away from this location (was only passing by because of business in Santa Monica).

I proposed that I email or fax them a copy of my receipt; person on the line asked his manager, who said no, there was no way. I couldn't believe it - the item was $40, and I expressly told them there was no way I would drive an hour and half to fix a mistake that one of their employees made. They still wouldn't budge from their offer - so I gave up, told them I'd sink the $40, gave them the name of their salesperson that made the mistake, and expressed my extreme displeasure.

Probably the worst case of customer service I've ever had in my life. I'm definitely never coming back here again.<//text>< Pics>

Good Neighbors, great service!  I'll have to admit that I was bummed to see that this beautiful old theater building turned into a bike shop. But, tonight they rescued us: My son just got a new bike today and on our first ride he the bike got a flat! Bummer! He needed his bike for the next day to take a trip with camp. We arrived at Performance Bicycle and it was after hours, however, I knocked on the door and a very nice man (Dave) opened the door for us and they repaired the problem with the tire!  Its nice to know there are folks out there that will go the extra mile to be nice!  We will be keeping our future business in the neighborhood!</review>

<text>(I wish I could post without a single star)
Terrible, worst customer service I've ever received from a bike shop. About a month ago I took in two bikes for their trade in program( to purchase a commuter bike from them) both bikes were appraised and I ended up only wanting to trade one in. They then took pictures of the bike and told me they had to send it off to see if they value was right since the wheels were different from the manufacturer, I said ok and that they would contact me within 48 hours. After 3 days I called, spoke to the manager (the assistant manager was supposed to call me back) and he told me that he himself didnt even know how the trade in program worked and would find out and call me back. Needless to say, I never received a phone call and decided to forget about it and take my business elsewhere. I sold the bike privately and took my business to Helens Cycles in Santa Monica and purchased my new commuter bike where I was helped within minutes of entering the shop. Performance Bicycle may have a lot of items to chose from but their employees are inexperienced in the business.<//text></record>

i thought i'd let everyone know that i purchased a bike here a couple of months ago and our sales person, i think his name was Matt, though it could've easily been something else -- the point is, he was very nice and helpful.  and i asked him for the "least expensive bike he'd recommend," which ended up being around three hundred dollars.  i seem to remember also getting a 10% discount on the purchase as well.  if this shop is close to you, check it out for yourself.  if, as some of the reviewers have said, nobody wants to help you, go somewhere else.  my experience was great and i'm very happy with the quality of the bike.< /review>

Very helpful employees, and awesome friendly bike mechanic.  Got my first road bike from them and a bunch of over accessories over the past year.  They're also great about price matching if there's a discrepancy from their online site vs store price or if an item becomes cheaper due to some holiday sale within 30 days or something.  They've also got a very friendly return policy too.

Obviously if you're an elite cyclist, you might not find what you're looking for here, but for the 99% of the population, this bike shop should more than fill your needs.  They also have no-drop group rides on Sunday Mornings which are great for beginners/intermediate folks.

One word of caution, they sometimes get insanely busy and don't have enough staff to attend to customers.  That might be one of their weaker points during peak hours.  Otherwise, just stick to going non-peak which means, don't go on weekend afternoons.</Text>

This is the place that you go to when all other options are unavailable. And you should expect to pay a lot more money for the privilege. It's places like this that keep me going on Amazon and eBay.<//review>

Wanted to post since it seems like people have a range of experiences here.

Been suffering from chain suck on my mtb. Called Performance and got some helpful tips and an invitation to come in whenever from Nick. Made it in, and Jorge took a look at my bike and filed down some rough metal nubs and wear on the inner part of my granny ring; he said this was what was catching and causing the suck. Gave me an ingenious way to check on a flat riding surface if chain suck was still happening (hold brakes, struggle to move forward pushing hard). Also pointed out what I'd have to buy if the suck stuck around, but without any upsell or pressure at all - actually in the context of educating me a little about my bike's gear equipment because I thought I'd need something different..

The whole thing took less than 30 minutes, and everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. I can't be certain yet whether it's resolved the issue - chain suck is complicated, and I'm trying it out on some real uphills today - but it was absolutely a positive experience and I'll be back.<//Text>

Found this place through maps search since there were t many accessible shops in hollywood.  Great service and prices.  Left my bike for a little bit when. I went tot he beach and then came back.  Changed thebtire really wuickly.  Good service on the phoje and reasonable prices.  Also got a good deal on aome bike lights.  You can also watch them repair bikes right there.  Id come back again next time i need my bike worked on.</text>

I walked in with hesitation thinking we wouldn't be able to sit and order and they greeted us so warmly and took care of us even past closing. My friends were very impressed. This is my favorite spot.</review><Name>Davon Mcdonald</Name>< user>

We love this place. Lisa and the gang are so sweet.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  Our favorites are the prik king, green curry, pad thai, and garden rolls. One of my top 3 restaurants in Los Angeles. You won't be disappointed.< /Text>

Great food but we waited 1 hour and 15 minutes to get our entrees. Untrained waiters.
Doesn't understand you serve a glass with a beer and when the customer asks for one you don't bring it 10 minutes later. Plus you serve everyone at the same time not one dish for one then 10 minutes another dish for the one your dining with. Plus you have utensils before the dish  is served. There were people that arrived after we did and they were served and left before we even got our entrees.  Won't be back.< /text>

I ordered on the phone & picked it up. The food was great, but there was a lot of fooling around, ordering on one of those delivery services, & the order didn't go through. From now on I'll just call it in to the restaurant.< /Review>

If you visit LA, "Sweet Chilli Thai restaurant" is the remarkable and unforgetable lunch & dinner for you, friends and family.< /review>< Pics>

Ordered on Postmates at 8 pm today (a Friday).
The food arrived at 10pm. It would have been understandable if the fault lay with Postmates but it was in fact this restaurant.

We called multiple times and LIED TO. Being told that our order got picked up even though we could see on Postmates that it wasn't.

After we basically gave up on the food and entirely forgot about it, it arrived at 10pm. 2 hours after we ordered it.

Our Postmates driver took it upon himself to explain the whole situation to us.
The poor guy was waiting at this restaurant for 45min.
He told us that other people walked out and some were waiting at the restaurant for their food for more than 2 hours.

When the food finally arrives at 10pm, it was disappointing to put it nicely. The salad rolls were fine, the spring rolls were good. Everything else SUCKED. The noodles were one solid piece of rubber that could bounce off the walls and tasted gross.

This was a terrible choice in dinner only made worse by the fact that we were lied to by the man on the phone and then ignored when we called 2 times after that 1st phone call until we called from a new number and the man finally picked up again, only to lie to us once again.

Steer clear. This place wont last long based on the horrible service and nasty food</text>

Ask for spring roll on the side or else it comes inside entree box. Theres alot of better Thai food in Hollywood area, but I guess if you're desperate and in this area then this is your place.</review>< Pics>

OK, but everything was a bit less good than I wanted, and the service was a somewhat slow. Also, why was there a single partially consumed glass of water in the middle of our table when we arrived?< /review>

But watch where you park on Campus we also got aparking ticket🤨 we were wondering why we got such good parking right in front.

Nice campus and beautiful views, but make sure you know where to park before going. Went to the visitor center specifically for the purpose of asking where to park. 3 minutes later I go back to my car to see the parking patrol putting a ticket on my car. I told him my story and was in process of moving to the right lot, but I was still cited.<//Text>

Santa Barbara is hella nice. Army ROTC and ASL and many majors and clubs that will appeal to all student types. Bike and skateboard lanes for those sporty students out there as well as a big wide beach view in the backyard</Review>

<review>Used them a few times now and service persons are always very helpful and professional. I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes and they offer vehicle registration services as well for a small processing fee, which is well worth it considering you can walk out the door with your new tags same day as well. Great one-stop shop to smog and register.<//review><GmapID>0x80d9577674a50bcf:0xd160c02c8d716334<//GmapID>< Resp>

<text>I brought in my Calif. smog inspection form and the procedure was completed in less than a half hour. This the fourth time I've had Dekra do my automobile smog inspection. The facility  can check two cars  at one time . Unless you go on a weekend to he check is prompt. I like this place because it's very clean and neat . It's also not noisy like a car dealership frequently is. Check Dekra website for discount coupons. Their  fee charged is fair and you won't have your time waisted by a low ball smog check that requires you to return a second time. My Toyota Camry is  in good mechanical condition  do I don't have smog problems. You can also do DMV registration and< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80d9577674a50bcf:0xd160c02c8d716334</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great service! Super fast, organized, generous waiting room amenities.   Adam was so professional and genuine by phone so I drove right over.  When I got there service was wonderful - Gilbert was really helpful going the extra mile helping me with the new sticker.  It was the last day to pay my registration -  worth it to pay my registration right there! (Adam and Gilbert worked in such great teamwork!)  I got the new sticker for 2019 immediatly.   What a relief!  No stressing - all done at one place!  Excellent old-school friendly service!<//review>

I love using this smog station. They are fast and the waiting room is clean. You also have the option to make an appointment online and sometimes you can get a coupon to help. Magazines and a hot cup of coffee are provided if you would like it as well.< /Text>

<review>All business are great when you pay them for a service and you receive the service you actually paid for. What really highlights a business character is how they handle issues. Unfortunately I have found that Dekra does NOT have the same standard of service when there is a question of the workmanship being done.

I brought my older vehicle to Dekra to be SMOG checked like I have before. I was met with a new set a faces but friendly and helpful all the same. My vehicle failed the fuel Evap part of the test, which is highly possible due to the vehicles age. I was informed this is due to leaks and to repair it and come back for the free test. Much time was spent looking for anything that could cause this leak and after some minor repairs (not needed but did them to be safe for the next test) the last smog test was done by Dekra only to fail again.

I took the vehicle to have a smoke test done on the Evap system only to find that there were no leaks in the system. This obviously is very confusing as I have one test saying there is a problem and another test saying there is NO problem.

I then took my vehicle to another SMOG test only location and passed with flying colors. I asked the SMOG technician how I could have failed the test before but not now. He said the only reason could have been the test not being performed correctly.

I made the La Mesa Dekra aware of the issue by speaking to Gilbert and requested to have credit toward services for future SMOG test (I test 3 vehicles every two years) in the total of the amount of what I paid to Dekra already for the failed smog tests and the cost of the unnecessary smoke test. I do NOT want any direct money back.

I was offered a free smog test for a future vehicle (less than the cost of my previous smog test) and that is it. This offer is far from what I would consider fair and speaks to management’s standards of service when presented with any issues. Dekra’s official response to my issues is that they have faith in their technician and not sure how it’s possible for a smoke test to pass and another SMOG test to pass.

Makes me wonder how many other customers may have paid money for nothing only.

Side Note: All the staff I have worked with has been friendly, it’s only the handling of this situation I take issue with.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Nice and Friendly Guy at Cashier/Technician, Open on Sundays. Was in and put about 45 minutes or less (2 Cars Ahead of me). My truck did not have to get on the Dyno because of year 2000 or newer do not have to. Free Kerig coffee for customers and a remodeled lounge with TV and I think WiFi (?).< /text>

They run a very efficient business. There are multiple departments that gets you in and out of there quickly and efficiently. I was able to get right away. They have the latest technology so it felt painless. Katherine Chen, M.D. was also helpful in resolving my concerns. Thank you!</review>

Glendale Eye has been the best medical experience I’ve had in ages.  Every single staff member I’ve come in contact with, from doctors to transportation has been top notch.  When there was a last minute mixup about my surgery time and I was freaking out about it, the staff jumped to get things resolved.  Everyone there is knowledgeable, friendly and compassionate.......Special thanks to Dr. Paul - my eyesight is restored!  And much, much appreciation for the angel Annabel A., Nurse Beverly and Claudina.< /Text>

As usual I received excellent and professional care from Glendale Eye.  I have been going here for examinations for close to 30 years and have always received thorough and excellent care.  Dr. Wang is one of the best.  She is always very thorough, professional and courteous and pleasant.  Her calm demeanor always puts you at ease.  Her assistant, Catherine (I think that is her name) is also excellent.  I would recommend Glendale Eye and although I have moved out of the area I will always go here for examinations.  My only complaint has nothing to do with Glendale Eye but has to do with the parking.</Review>

Dr. Marta Recasens is an absolute professional. Before I sing her praises, however, I need to provide some background regarding how I came into her care.

Roughly six months ago, I started hemorrhaging in my right eye. I soon discovered that my diabetes was out of control. Ten years of neglect had finally caught up with me. In my haste to resolve the issue, I searched online and found an ophthalmologist nearby. As it turns out, I would soon regret my decision. The ophthalmologist attempted to perform laser eye treatment without checking my blood glucose level and the result was a bruised cheek from an injection and pronounced double vision that persist to this day.

About a week later, after I had finally visited a doctor for the first time in 12 years, I was referred to Dr. Marta Recasens. I struggle to put into words how grateful I am to Dr. Recasens for all that she has done for me. Dr. Recasens immediately took charge of my case and made absolutely certain that my diabetes was under control before starting a series of eye treatments.

As I type this, I am on the road to recovery. The hemorrhaging has stopped and eyesight is clearer. The double vision caused by the other doctor has also subsided substantially. I do not subscribe to the notion of guardian angels, but Dr. Recasens comes pretty close. She is kind and gentle and absolutely no nonsense. Dr. Recasens will make certain that you know exactly what the situation with your vision is. She also has a gentle hand for the more delicate procedures.

I most highly recommend Dr. Recasens if you are looking for an ophthalmologist who is compassionate and professional. I also recommend her if you harbor any fear and anxiety regarding medical procedures. Dr. Recasens and her wonderful staff will put you at ease.
Thank you, Dr. Recasens.

- Andrew M.</Text>

Waited over one and half hour to see the doctor, for a five minute visit. They appear to book way too many patients in too little of a time frame. The staff is fine, but the office policies are the worst!</Text>

<Review>Having been around opthomalogy long before the Glendale Eye Medical Group became the practice that it now is and associated with its progenitors as well, it would be most difficult to find any collection of ophthomalogists better qualified to treat eye diseases of all kinds, as well as the very important aspect of exacting refractions, than the doctors who comprise the Glendale Eye Medical Group.  In the County of Los Angeles, Glendale has long been a major medical center, a claim which can be documented back into the 1930's.  The doctors in the Glendale Eye Medical Group are comparable to or surpass easily in professional competence  any which may be found in Southern California including the Doheny group at USC.  It should always be remembered that in any area of medicine, there are doctors and, then, there are doctors.  The M.D.'s at Glendale Eye Medical Group stand out head and shoulders in the latter group just cited.  Not only has this been a source of continuing satisfaction to me, it has been very successful for my wife who has had to deal with some delicate optical problems as well.  One can hardly do better in Southern California.<//Review>< user_id>

<Review>I have only been going to this group for the past 3 or so years.  I was referred to Dr. Darlington (by the doctor who did my cataract surgery) when a friend needed Cataract Surgery. She thought that she was going permanently blind .  Dr. Darlington did a complete examination and explained that it was only severe cataracts.  He put my friend at ease and returned her sight to her in short order.  Everyone, including Dr. Darlington was so good to my friend.  Since I was working, they arranged for transportation to and from my home (close by in Glendale) before and after the surgery. I now count on Dr. Darlington and Dr. Drexl for my eye care.  The support staff is excellent too!

The new offices are great but I was always amazed at how they kept track of us in the old building - in the maze of rooms.  Now the maze of rooms are in long hallways organized to be as efficient as possible.< /Review>< pictures>

This place first time here waited for my friend turned out she was waiting at the other one owned by same people..I ordered a lychee shake that was hood..and pho beef soup..which I did not tasted had to bring it to go since I was at the wrong location ..parking is good..patio was spaced apart..on the street  sidewalk at least it was not on the street itself ..I would not want dust, fine dirt flying in my food with noise etc..so that was a good thing it was near on the sidewalk<//text>

<text>The food was good. The soda was flat and I was almost done with my meal before they brought me a replacement. The waiter heard me complaining about it and brought out my soda. Communication among staff is poor. The wait for a table was decent. I've ordered take out from this place before and they were quick and got my order right. I'll go back again. We should be patient with people as we maneuver through the re-opening of businesses.<//text><response>None</response>< userid>

<response>None</response><Text>Another place that did not meet my expectations based from finding this joint on five star google reviews.

Solely based on the quality of food.

The shrimp on my order was over cooked with that super fishy, stinky taste of spoiled or bad shrimp. The pork chop was also over cooked and so dry that he didn’t even bother eating it. Almost to the point where it could have been a jerky.

Service was good and they currently have out door seating.< /Text><user>115391966130693506810< /user>< time>

We were so pleased that everything was exactly as we like it. Egg rolls were nice and crispy and didn't turn soggy in the 10 minutes to get home and veggies also were crispy and our meals were very tasty and they are on point with their seasonings were perfect 👌.  Needless to say that we finally found our new awesome restaurant 🤗</Text>< Pictures>

I got #1 Pho. Easy on the meat and the broth was fine but not excellent with lots of flavor, just a broth, kinda flavorless. We got also a pork dish, same here easy on the meat with a boatload of rice, great flavor. Water seems to be unfiltered with some chlorine flavor. Overall an authentic place, many guests but not 5 stars. When paying for your food one has to wait in line for the one cashier.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Pretty good pho if you are in Vallejo. Their pho broth doesn't seem to use msg. Sides are fresh. Bowls are smaller than the regular size they serve at Vietnamese restaurants.

Services:
Better service than your typical pho place.

Seating:
Seating is very spaced apart during the covid pandemic.</text>

Beef stew is great for takeout in these covid times.  Vegetarian dishes are great for when we return to regular dining.</review>

<date>1494119404990<//date><Rating>4</Rating><text>This is my first time coming here and I super love the interior of the place. Servers and crew are very attentive with excellent customer service. Food arrives fast as compared to other restaurants. They politely asked us if we want a refill whenever they see our drinking glass empty.

We ordered 96 Bún Tôm, Tht Nng, Ch Giò (BBQ shrimp, grilled sliced pork, egg roll w/vermicelli) and 70 Cm Gà, Ht Gà, Tàu H Ky (BBQ chicken, sunny side up egg, fried shrimp cake w/steamed rice). I haven't tried the other menu but I find the #70 meal lacks flavor especially the BBQ chicken.

I will definitely come back here again and try the others on the menu.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Went here on a whim after visiting the theme park. It was very clean, with a pleasant atmosphere. We were greeted immediately upon arrival. Staff is very attentive and friendly. The menu is quite large, with flavors for every possible palate. Everyone in my group settled on a different variety of Pho, and we were all very pleased.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Had lunch and was surprised at the extensive menu of noodle, appetizers and other dishes. Started with sesame tea and spring rolls. For the main course I had a stir fry chicken and vegetable dish with white rice. The food was served hot and seasoned well. There was ample chicken and vegetables. Others in the party has noodles and one as actually served the wrong dish which was corrected quickly. Very good and filing meal.< /Review>< Pics>

In this time of cooties and covid, sometimes you just need soup! Pho makes several versions of Pho - and all are wonderfully fresh and beautiful. All the veggies are local, the proteins are always beautiful. It's Really Great Pho!! Try the bbq shrimp as an appetizer!
The have another shop next door that serves bahn mi sandwiches (cash only). Great food!</review>

< Review>
I was very happy few years ago this place appeared in Vallejo. Our gorgeously located bay area town desperately needs updates it deserves. And it was the place that gave me hope Vallejo will be on its way to be a city of the future.
Nice exterior design. Beautiful modern interior design.
Food we liked, and nice service. Thank you for making Vallejo better!< /Review>

First visit. Our server was unusually sharp – attentive and extremely helpful – very much on top of things. The pho was good; maybe not the best although it’s hard to say because I ordered a type of noodle I hadn’t tried before. Broth excellent.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Got some food to go and it was still good portion size and amount of meat and extra sides including hoisen and Sriracha. The broth of the beef pho was great and the spring rolls had both shrimp and pork and not too much noodle. My vermicelli dish had plenty of grilled pork. I would definitely eat here or order here again with the large size and many seating options available</text>

If you remember their old location by CVS this new place is ten times bigger! Despite the new place and new atmosphere the food and customer service is still the same which is a good thing. Be prepared to wait during their busy dinner times, this just goes to show how great this place is.<//text>

<Review>Fast service. The staff here is on it. Came in during lunch time. Community style seating is fun and friendly. Food came out fast. Very delicious as expected. The large is LARGE. The small bowl would be enough. Place is kept nice and clean, including the bathrooms. Highly recommended!<//Review>< userid>

I usually order the large #11 pho and it comes with a good amount of noodles and meat. As you can see from the photos, the bbq chicken vermicelli (#90) also comes with a lot of chicken! The vermicelli dishes also come with a free side of soup which is nice if you wanted something warm but didn't want to order pho. The service here is great and the food comes out very fast.<//Review>

This place is wonderful. Fantastic food that is affordable. My favorite is #25. My wife is more a fast food chick and she loved #47. Ingredients are always fresh. Every time I eat there I feel like I ate a quality meal. I've gone to places that are twice as expensive and have the same portions and quality. Best place to go after a long day's work. Staff has always been on point. One of the main managers remembered me by name after just a few visits. Lots of room with multiple tables and two large TV screens for when you're afraid of missing the second quarter of a Warriors game. Food time is relatively very quick but worth waiting for if the line is longer. I highly recommend trying it. Easily 5 stars.<//Review>

<text>It's hip and tasty and fast! Only problem is they use soy sauce in their broths! For a celiac that's a no-no!

The pho was ok however when we went to the bahn mi shop attached to it and was horrified after ordering BBQ chicken sandwich to find pork in it. After asking to speak with someone who understood English.. I was told the pork is a regular ingredient in the chicken sandwich they just don't list it on the list of ingredients along with everything else. Like it's a special bonus item.. not impressed with their lack of clear labeling</Text>

Ok it is clean and all and a little cozy, but wait a dang minute. I ordered the #26 the menu says spicy beef soup with pork. Nowhere does it say tripe. But that's what they gave me. I couldn't even take a small bite. I am so sorry for needing to write this up but to me that's a very huge mistake.

Sorry. Thanks though< /text>

The staff doesn't always communicate well, so special orders are tricky. But the the food makes up for that. This place is always busy, but the size and speed of service makes wait times short, usually no more the 5 minutes.

Really delicious food here. Super friendly waiters and fast service. Busy at nights, slower during lunch. Decent prices and delicious Pho. Sometimes the waiter can be a bit forgetful hence the 4 stars. But overall really happy with all my experiences here.<//Review>

<username>Ouiam Leann Koubaa<//username><text>high quality, yummy food for a very very reasonable price. Everything comes out fresh and quick. This is my go-to place in Vallejo.

I'm editing this review to note that they do not hold food allergies seriously. We didn't want pork and after telling them to remake the whole dish they got wrong, we could still see traces of pork bits in our meal.< /text>< Resp>

<review>I can't say enough about this place! We were traveling from Phx and we had our blind Pitbull with us and we're happy to eat on the patio but they insisted we brought him in! Every wait staff made a point to come visit him. The food came out as soon as we placed our order even though it was a full house. The food was fresh, tasty, and cheap as hell! Thank you for your kindness during our difficult time. We will make a point of coming back

For my birthday I wanted my favorite chicken wings but I also ordered the shrimp and mixed vegetables with vermicelli which I won't ever order again. It was loaded with some red type of sauce, neither sweet or sour, thank goodness, but what irked me the most was that the menu never mentioned it would be swimming in this red sauce. My digestive system and taste buds are very sensitive and the menu needs to be very descriptive  and exact. Ask for exact detailed ingredients if you go to this place.</Text>

In this area, Vallejo, CA, there are only two places where you can get Bahn Mi sandwiches. But I chose this one. The sandwiches are good, the service is good.  THEY NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED BETTER BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION.
THEY ARE JUST BEHIND THE PHO1 on SONOMA BLVD., SAME AREA AS BUD'S   BURGERS.

I always get the Vietnamese meatloaf with pate and BBQ chicken with pate with a crunchy French bread and fresh pickled vegetables..  Their sandwich menu is limited, but their pleasant customer service want to make you come back again.
I've eaten a lot of Bahn Mis from different areas,   this place makes it rewarding to go to.  It's one of those things when you are hungry and craving for something to eat but don't know exactly what you want that's very satisfying, good and affordable.  We are satisfied!!< /Text>

The pho here is ok, but not near the best I have had. ...nor the worse. It is clean and bright and they have a server standing at the door ready to seat you when you arrive. The service was a little odd, though; it was very empty when I arrived, but I was placed right next to the entrance. I guess they didn’t want to waste a good table on one person. The plastic woven seats are comfortable, but seemed to sit a little low to the table. However, that was a minor issue; just felt a little off-putting. The pho came out quickly (which is to be expected), but the drink did not; how do you make a bowl of pho quicker than a glass of water?! I had my food and no drink for a few minutes. The utensils (chop sticks and spoon) were ok, but subpar compared to better places. Not a bad experience, but not great either. More “meh” than anything. Not worth a return trip.<//Text>

She had chicken and rice, two good-sized pieces off grilled chicken, also delicious!  $22 total bill (them darn Pepsi’s) and we left full and satisfied!  Think we’re going to make this a monthly trip: well worth the drive from Fairfield/Vacaville area. The only downside: the place probably seats 100, but the bathroom (men’s anyway) accommodates 1 (1 commode; 1 urinal).</Text>< pics>

This place is great! Good options, not a major menu, but just the perfect PHO and dried plates, boba drinks, very family/group friendly and staff always making the best for accomodations and serving you with good attention. They are always on a roll!<//text>

They have a wide variety of soups, not all of them rice noodles--some have egg noodles or clear noodles too. They also have various rice dishes, stir fried dishes, and noodle dishes (that aren't soup). Their spring rolls are amazing, but I highly recommend the fried chicken wings appetizer (it could be a meal on it's own). They also have a large selection of beverages, including beer on tap and boba drinks. I highly recommend the Thai tea and iced Vietnamese coffee. Both of them are some of the best I've ever had, and I'm a Thai tea fanatic and have had it at hundreds of places. This is also one of the only places I've been to that does seafood pho so amazingly well.< /review>

Like we're suppose to automatically know that? They should have posted a sign that you should get the containers your self.

I don't like to write bad reviews...anyone can find not so good food and service ...I gave five stars so why am I talking about not so good... Yesterday I ate here and everything that could go wrong did. The regular manager was not there ..TODAY
IT WAS A DIFFERENT PLACE...
THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT THE SRVICE PLEASANT..THE RESTAURANT IS CLEAN AND REST ROOM ARE WELL TAKEN CARE OF....I DONT USUALLY GIVE FIVE STARS AND I WROTE A DIFFERENT REVIEW THAT HAD FOUR STARS .I CHANGED IT BECAUSE THEY LET ME ORDER A HALF ORDER OF EGG ROLLS ..SO INSTEAD OF FOUR I GOT TWO...
I WILL CONTINUE TO SEARCH OUT GOOD ASIAN FOOD. WHEN IN VALLEJO CA. I WILL VISIT HERE AGAIN. I am gIad I had the chance to eat here again before writing a review.. they went from zero to hero with the regular manager here.. I thought why would so many good reviews be posted if it's bad. Remember if you post a bad review it affects everyone who works there...
So two thumbs up for number 1 noodle house a rare and deserved five< /Text>

First time and it was fantastic. Large portions served quick.

Got the beef pho myself and didn't really like it, but tasted my partner's chicken pho and it was fantastic. Will definitely return.<//Text>

The hot chili oil on the table which looked like tar in oil was the best part! I love spicy pho!  Will come again. Oh and the food comes out really fast!

The chicken pho I had here was by far and away one of the best I've had. The broth was delicious and everything was cooked just beautifully. My friends had the veggie pho and the beef pho, both also just SO delicious. Service is very fast and friendly, even when every table is filled and there is a line of people waiting to be seated. Definitely a true gem and a delight! I'll be back for sure!</text>

The soup is great! We have been here multiple times and continue to go on a regular basis. There is also a points club that you can join to earn free items. Boba is also sold here.<//review>

I went for to go food I ordered some nooddles and shrimp I paid $15. When I got home I pulled the dry nooddles to put it on my plate it was a small roach I couldn't belive it...... I didn't want to come back to the restaurant and explain what happened afraid that they wouldn't believe I had to throw away all the food..... Disappointed</Review>

I thought the exterior was dark and a bit different but inside the restaurant was very bright and beautiful.  I rarely eat in Vallejo but this place Is absolutely worth a try if you like Vietnamese food and Pho. I enjoyed it but there are places in Pittsburg I like better.<//Text>

<Text>Good Pho requires rice noodles. That is not what you will get at PHO Noodle House. They use a much thicker flour noodle which is just a mess to eat with chopsticks.

Chicken is probably a safe bet, but I would avoid the beef and pork meat choices. The Spicy Beef includes pork cuts that I've never seen in my life. They looked like half circles of bologna maybe? The beef was definitely not lean.

Nice lunch time atmosphere and service was pleasant. Although I ran into problems with the order and correcting it was a bit of a challenge.

I may go back. But I'm spoiled when it comes to Pho. Hong Kee & Kim in San Francisco is the same price and a big step up in quality. Why a Pho restaurant would use flour noodles instead of rice noodles is beyond me.< /Text>< Pictures>

Not a great space to hang out or conversate while eating. It is generally crowded and noisey with not so comfy chairs.

That being said, if you need to throw down some good pho and a couple spring rolls, jump off the highway and hit pho 1</review>< rating>

<review>Tried a Pho place in Santa Rosa for my first experience, wasn't impressed. I wanted to try Pho again to make sure if I liked it or not. A friend brought me here and I got some Pho and their little egg rolls, so damn good. Been back a few times since for the Pho and egg rolls. They serve it piping hot and the broth doesn't have a too strong herbal taste which is why I didn't care for the place in SR.</review><gmap_id>0x8085735268d0a2e7:0x122d343d99af9be</gmap_id><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>109767023943756786768< /UserId.><user_name>Chief Walking Water< /user_name></record>

Food is alright, but the service is terrible. I normally don't mind minimal service, but the waiter kept dodging our table. I told him the order was wrong and he rolled his eyes as he took it back. Service was nonexistent for the rest of the night.</text>

I just love this place! So clean inside and friendly smiles on the waitstaff! I cannot resist ordering the #1 phở ... simply delicious and the basil, bean sprouts, sliced peppers and lime wedge couldn't be fresher! The price is also extremely reasonable and considerably less than the neighbourhood competition ...</text>

When it comes to pho in Vallejo, you really don’t have any other choice except here. Make no mistake this place serves decent pho and other Vietnamese dishes. Service is great and prices are low. I usually just order the #1 XL Pho; it has everything you expect in pho (thin steak, brisket, tripe, tendon, & meatball).  Its location is easy to find in the CVS plaza with a gigantic parking lot. Relatively speaking Pho in Vallejo = PHO1 Noodle House.<//text>

<Text>Delicious pho.

I currently work in the plaza so I frequent the restaurants pretty often. Obviously this plaza is terrible. With the homeless people and all the ricers showing off, it's not pretty. Fortunately the Vietnamese food here is actually the best in Vallejo.

Eating pho twice a week these past four years away in college, I was looking for a good Vietnamese place near home. Pho1 isn't a place to really impress anyone. Vietnamese restaurants just aren't meant for that. Instead it's a real cozy down to earth restaurant with good quality pho. I love the seafood pho they have. I hardly ever see seafood pho in Vietnamese restaurants so try it out if you like a rich garlicky seafood taste.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

PHO SHO!

Sorry, I had to get that stupid, bordering on asian teeny booper-ish misnomer out of my head before I got started on this review. Now that I have that out of the way, on to the review.

Pho (which is pronounced "fa", which also explains the phrase I mentioned at the onset of this review) is one of my favorite soups. Probably number 3 in the list of my favorite soups. My list goes like this:

1. Ramen
2. Udon
3. Pho
4. That junky oh-so bad for you Campbell's one with the mini burgers
5. Dinner cereal

Pho is awesome. Especially on a cold day where you've got a cold and your girlfriend is giving you the cold shoulder while you listen to Stone Cold Steve Austin's theme song. When you think of good quality food, you don't usually think of Vallejo, CA (aka the neglected child of the Bay Area that learned to fend for himself without parental supervision, but strictly on it's steel will and heart of frickin' GOLD.) You're... right for the most part. It's mostly fast food joints and your dime a dozen Chinese restaurants here. But here and there, peppered amongst the landscape, you'll find some good eats. Pho #1 happens to be one of those places.

This little gem is nestled nearby CVS (also the same plaza that houses Starbread aka home of the senorita sweet bread aka crack bread as well as Tapioca Express aka bored young Filipinos wanna hang out in Vallejo and OMG THIS PLACE HAS BOBA! (their wording, not mine)). It's extremely unassuming and you'd never see it driving down Sonoma Blvd. Once you drive into the plaza, you're golden. I know that Burger King is staring at you longingly, but ignore that for now. You're here for some good Vietnamese food.

Inside, the surroundings/environs aren't much to talk about. Just some very basic tables and chairs in here. It's not that big of a place either, though i've seen some pretty nice sized groups eat here before (myself being a part of one of those groups on one occassion.) You'll be handed a menu with ohhhhhhhhhhh so many things to choose from, descriptions and photos a-plenty. Ordering is done is a timely fashion as well. In a few minutes, boom, hot food is on your table.

Everything here is good. The rolls (both the rice noodle ones and fried) are a great way to start a meal here. Just the right amount of tasty nomage. The rice plates are pretty much the bomb. My favorite rice plate is the standard BBQ pork with the egg. I always order an extra egg as I LOVE FRIED EGGS. And there is just wayyy too many good soups to choose from. My favorite would probably be the beef combination one with the beef ball, steak, flank, and tripe. Chicken and seafood soups are also no slouches here. The flavors here are always off the wall and you always get large hearty portions. Leaving here hungry means either a) you didn't order food or b) you are, in fact, the cyborgs that the Conner family tried to warm me about. That and something about a Skynet.

If you're in Vallejo for some reason or another (I can only assume you have family here OR you're visiting Six Flags) and you're craving some really good Vietnamese food, do yourself a huge favor and go to Pho #1. You will leave full and satisfied, the top two things on your meal experience list... which goes like this:

1. Full
2. Satisfied
3. Ice water
4. Man at nearby table keeps giving me disturbing/awesome look
5. Dinner cereal</Text>
