Nice spot to cut your own tree, or buy a pre cut one. They have a wide selection! Staff are all great and helpful. They have a little gift shop and stuff to do with the small kids. There’s chicken running loose, the lil ones seemed to enjoy that! It was a nice experience to get out with family and breathe that fresh air and to be surrounded by beautiful trees!<//review>

My absolute favorite place to be! I go here every year for my Christmas tree since I was a little kid it has so many classic decorations around the farm that bring back fun happy memories! There's chickens and kitties and a couple of family friendly dogs walking around and the staff are absolutely sweet as can be! I would recommend coming here for a happy family Christmas experience! 🎄🎄🎄</review>

This place was great! This will be our new go to pumpkin patch! Lots of land and stuff to do (even during covid). Everything was very reasonable priced, pumpkins were $2.50-$10. Activities were included or nicely priced compared to others in the areas around us! Go support locals! Especially ones who are not trying to price gouge you!<//Review>

A bit more expensive than we expected.  Still happy to support local farmers rather than box stores. Covid put a damper on some activities.  No mistletoe this year.< /text>

Lots of help even with Covid 19. The employees are all very helpful and get you through the selection, paying and tree prep quickly. And despite the huge demand for trees this year we were still able to find a couple types of really nice 6 to 8 foot precuts in enough quantity to have the I like this one but I like that one kid discussion. :)  was well distanced, honored needs for masks and again were very efficient and helpful. In a hard year, was the break we needed and this place never fails to provide it. Love also supporting local family business and purchase yearly hand made ornament for the tree. Looking forward to next when the fire and hot drinks are bad too!< /text>

The kids had a blast! Not as many interactive activities, like playground or corn bath, but still so much fun. We love the tractor ride to feed the ducks!< /Review>

Walking among the trees is a tradition before Christmas. The smell and scenery is wonderful.  The staff is wonderful. The gift shop is stocked with unique items. Owner labeled an ornament for us at no additional charge. Fire in front and free spiced cider and popcorn. Who could ask for more?< /Review>

Was a nice place and  staff were friendly.  But $58 for a cut your own tree even if it's less than 5ft seemed a bit expensive.  Pre cut trees were anywhere from $67 and up (table tops were around $37).</text>

Only go if you are at  30min before closing. They locked their doors at 7pm even though it states 730pm on their hours. Has happened 3x now, we know not just not to go back. Oh well.<//review>

Very good toasty sub. Portion was less than it used to be and price still the same. ( I would expect that during inflation years.) Anyway, the place was clean and service very good. Give it a try you might like toasty flavors.<//text>

<Text>Really good salads and soup. Any one of their sandwiches can be made into a salad. The bags of chips are bigger than subways. The cheddar broccoli soup was really good. they give you a lot of meat on the sandwich for the price that you pay. Friendly staff completed our order in a very timely manner. And this place serves Pepsi which is a huge bonus!!!!!!<//Text><rate>5<//rate>< Pics>

<Text>It was great, love the black peppercorn sandwich. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. The 2 ladies that were there were really nice. The ice tea was out and the older lady went to the back to get more when anyone else would've just said "no we're out". Thank you ladies!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80ea43ad2b5d3681:0xc3a6c801625111be< /Gmap_id>< response>

I love their sandwiches. So tasty. Real flavors and taste like real food, unlike other sub sandwich stores that have zero flavor<//Text>

I love this place! It blows all of the other sub places out of the water. Much better quality sandwiches. I always love the smell every time I come in here and the employees are good at making the subs unlike other places where they are just thrown together.</text>

Comparable in price, but I believe the ingredients are more fresh and include no imitation meats. They also have a number of different sauces and peppers (buffet like) at your disposal.

They toast every sandwich...<//Text>< Pics>

Went at 5pm on saturday 25 may 2019.  The two men working there were so friendly and helpful that instead of window shopping, I bought over $150 in merchandise.  Felt very confident with my purchase due to their expertise.  Thank you.</Text>

<Text>This is our second year in rec soccer and Extreme soccer is the place contracted for our league uniforms.  I think they offer great service, a good selection of items, some pretty good sales, and a good central location.  The employees are always very nice and ready to greet you.  When I coached last year , they were very helpful with advice for items that would be useful during team practices.  The soccer kits are pretty reasonably priced as well for the soccer leagues at about $30 for a shirt with custom number, shorts and socks.  A great local small business.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>It’s a good club but there’s so much to be changed. I was member at LifeTime when I lived in another state and that’s the comparison I have. I just would like to give some recommendations to the club.

There’s not many towels and the towels are inside the gym (at least they were last year, this year they’ve changed them and now they’re just outside the gym so you still have to go inside the door in the hallway to get them), which doesn’t make any sense to me. Towels should be in the bathroom or at least right by them. Last year there was so many times I was  already all changed to get in the pool and had to either go get a towel in a swimming suit or get dressed again, which is so annoying, especially when you have kids and practical things is so helpful.

At the baby’s pool there’s no umbrellas and the moms have to watch their kids under the very hot sun or drag the umbrellas (what I have done a couple times) that are very heavy all the way by the pool so they can get some shade while watching the babies.

The gates that work with the magnetic keys are just a big pain in the neck and don’t work most of the times. Also the gate between the gym and the pool is even more useless.

The pools are very cold when it’s not hot season, even though they say they’re heated. They’re not heated enough, it’s freezing for me.

And the last but not least, about the snack pool bar. It’s never opened! Swimming season has started over a month ago and the snack pool bar it’s still closed. We want to get snacks, food, ice cream etc without having to call anywhere. It’s understandable not being opened in the cold season but since the weather has gotten warm I think they should have opened it right away, they could do 6 months closed and 6 months opened (mid April to mid October).

Anyway, I do love the music at the pool, the tuna sandwich and the margaritas, the pools are great and it’s a beautiful club, but just these topics to be changed and it would maybe be a great club.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>On March 4, The Alamo Women's Club sponsored an Authors' Faire at Round Hill Country Club, featuring 7 local authors. It was a wonderful event! The venue was beautiful, The service was perfect and the brunch buffet was out of this world. We will definitely return to Round Hill next year for our Second Annual Authors' Faire. It could not have been nicer. Thank you Heather and your staff for your help in making this a huge success - for Alamo Women's Club and the charities we support and for the authors and for our guests who attended.

Only one staff working, she responsible for cashier, making the coffee, cleaning the tables. As a result, the environment was quite dirty. Full of drinks and cakes residue. And the shop is pretty noisy that i need to move sitting outside near the road.< /review>

<Text>My usual place.
Truly appreciate the short proximity to my house. I usually go walking and enjoy a great tasting iced latte. However, they often ran out of Oatmilk, and I instantly regret not driving to the Starbucks down the road.< /Text>< rating>

lemonade is $3.25 add peach juice $0.8 they charge me $5.some cents
and casher say because we are under sheraton hotel, so we more expensive, if you order lemonade with peach juice, that will be peach green tea lemonade price and you don't want tea. ha interesting. i need perfect my language if i order peach lemonade at here, i need say can i have a lemonade ? anything else? add peach juice.</Text>

Not a huge deal.

<review>Nuh-uh. Not this Starbucks. I'm sorry, but just, NOPE.

I was so excited when it first opened up. The other Starbucks was half hour walk away. When you have no car to drive, and when you love Starbucks as much as me, you'll understand how excited I was.

However, the drinks were just awful! Maybe it's because the staffs are all new? First, they gave me extra ice when I asked for light ice. I asked them to change it, but they just scooped out all the ice, and left the rest of the cup empty. They offered an explanation before I could point out the empty space. "Sorry, if I add more milk, it'll taste bad." Okay, fine, I'll just drink my half cup of mocha when I payed for the price of one.

Few days later, a friend asked me to bring her a cup of latte macchiato. I also got myself a cup of the mango dragonfruit drink. When she got her drink, it just tasted like heavy creamer and milk. There was absolutely no flavor in it other wise. Sadly, we had to throw the whole cup away. I drank my mango dragonfruit, but it was very watered down, and I think they forgot about the mango syrup...

Few months later (a week or two weeks ago), I thought they had enough time to learn, so I went and visited again. I got myself a cup of white chocolate mocha. Ugh... It looked just like milk (yes, pain white), and taste just like milk.... I asked the server about it, and she kindly remade my drink. "With extra pump of white mocha," she says. Only, this time it was so sweet, the mocha and chocolate flavor was way too much. Well, it's better than the milk...

It's going to be another few months before I come back. Hopefully, they'll be real Starbucks by then... Hopefully...</review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Starbucks here is high on the ceiling of the triangular window, so it is decided to be full of space. The seat is full and not crowded. The staff is clean and the environment is clean. I am very cold and feel good.

<Text>We were introduced to this place by a colleague from work. He raved about their food and so I brought my office staff for a treat. We all loved the food! But when we had the chance to discuss our experience in terms of service, we all agreed that the Mother, Pina (the main cook) and her daughter, the server did not treat us well. They were friendly to other customers who were white but noticeably different with us. Because of their good food, our first not pleasant experience did not stop us from coming back. On our next visit my children who are Italian food lovers joined me and my office crew. It was again pretty obvious that while the daughter and server was very chatty with other white customers, she was hardly talking to us and forgetting our orders and needed to be followed up. We did try to be friendly guests but for some reason, we as a group, were not appealing to them. When kitchen is not so busy, Pina would get out and talk to customers but not to us. Not taking offense to our experiences, we patronized them 2 more times by ordering party trays but even these were not a good experience. We stopped patronizing Pina's since then. There are other well deserving restaurants out there.I don't want to name our bad experiences but you can read between the lines and determine for yourself.</Text>< rating>

<rating>2<//rating><review>After reading all the reviews we were expecting something really great.  Nothing special, not spectacular. Pretty mediocre Italian food. Staff was very nice. Probably wouldn't recommend. If someone doesn't know great Italian, they probably won't know the difference. No offense to the owner, they're trying their best, but it's just so, so.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My family and I went here on Saturday for an early Father's Day dinner for my dad. My parents have been here several times before, but this was my first time going with them and my husband. The food is absolutely amazing, it's family owned and we will definitely be going back!</text>

Probably the best Italian food you'll get outside of Italy. Pina and her crew are the friendliest folks around and truly care about their craft. 3rd time here and it couldn't have been better.</text>

<Text>I love Pina's Bistro Restaurant from the very first time I saw it (it was closed) when I stopped next door for other business. 2 months ago, I actually visited it for the very first time! I had The best creamy and delicious pasta and I met Pina!!! This evening, I found out that her recipe for the Alfredo doesn't include the strong chemicals other Alfredo sauces have since she prepares it in a natural and in the most natural way. I saw she has her tomato sauces and salad dressing in bottles to be bought in case you want to take them to your home! She is adorable, professional, and a very good chef!  As the saying says: "Barriga llena, corazón contento".  We love Pina!!!  August 21, 2019 # # #Erkdz #USA #California #CA< /Text></record></dataset><record>

They make their own sausage to add to their pastas.
I had the spicy penne with pork sausage and I really appreciated that it wasn't overly salty.
It was mixed with sliced red bell peppers and a quality olive oil and their house made sausage.
The side salad that came with the meal had a house made dressing that was delicious.
All in all it was a very good experience.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dcdbd88531d517:0xa1180c86eb09d085</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Small storefront b!istro with outdoor seating.  Home style Italian faire prepared individually to order by Pina and served by her daughters. An assortment of daily specials are  offered and an excellent choice of Italian wines are available.  Homemade lemoncello is an added bonus.  A bit pricey but well deserved.</Text>< pictures>

I've been here a couple times and the food is really amazing.  Everything is very noticeably fresh and the flavors of the sauces are amazing.  It's pretty pricey for Italian food but it is so worth it.  I came here with a couple friends and we're always amazed by our meals.  We then try each others' food and are amazed.  Pina makes her own sausages (delicious!) and makes her own sauces every day.  She even carries a few Italian beers that are surprisingly good. It can get busy in the evenings so you may want to call ahead and make reservations.<//Review>

One of the best places to visit in Houston downtown for Indian food. We ordered paneer pizza and rolls. They have so much of paneer, which you will never imagine that a restaurant in downtown would add so much to fill your hearts content. Their incorporation of Indian flavors into pizza is just fantastic! Never miss out on the paneer pizza!< /Review>

<review>If I could give Pina's 10 stars I would!  We drove 3 hours to go to Pina's because the name caught my attention , we share the same name and I was intrigued.  After reading the reviews I knew I had to try it. This is an authentic Italian family run Restaurant.   Pina makes everything from scratch just like I would at home. The whole meal was scrumptious, from the fresh home made bread I was hooked. We had calamari,  salad, lasagna and her special home made sausage alla pizzaiola.  Finished with the best homemade tiramisu,  cannoli and espresso. Needless to say this was the best dining experience.  Pina and her daughter Rachel were so attentive , friendly and a pleasure to interact with and made us feel like part of the family. Definitely worth the drive. She even sent me home with some of her homemade bread. The only downside is that I won't be able to come back as often as I  would like because I  live so far,  but I will definitely make a point of coming back whenever I can.< /review></record>

Absolutely delicious. Home cooking with a home vibe. Intimate seating, family owned and run, Pina even cane to sit with us for a while and told us a bit about her family history. We went there for my birthday and received a scrumptious mascarpone filled cannoli. We're planning on going back soon! FYI, just call before visiting to make sure you get a table.<//text>

Over the past 10 years whether Pina or her daughters were chefing the dining experience has always a pleasure. Visit once and Pina's Bistro immediately will top your list of favorite places to dine. Pina bakes her own bread each day before the sun wakes up, hunts down the freshest veggies, and goes all out every day for her dining clientele. Her filet mignon would do my home state of Texas proud. All Pina's Specials are just that. Special. One word to avoid being disappointed. Make reservations. (Okay so it was two words).<//text>

<user>113943928757020096869<//user><response>None</response><Text>It's a pretty meh park. I live nearby and it's good on some days when the breeze is just right. But there's no working water fountains, the tennis court is missing the net, one of the basket ball hoops is missing the netting, and the children's playground was previously burned down. The city needs to invest more into playgrounds.</Text><rating>3< /rating>< Pictures>

This park is vey nice for spending time with family and friends. The bad thing is when people came and smoke weed, drink alcohol, or drive very fast. When that happen, I do not feel safety there.<//review>

<Text>I had a broken tooth that bothered me all the time. I stopped in to PAK dentist without an appointment. I was just a walk-in. They were very nice and it did not long for the dentist to see me. I asked him to extract my tooth and he did that fast and it did not hurt me at all. He was very nice and kept asking me if I was in any pain. The cost was quite reasonable. Now it does not hurt when I eat cold food like ice cream</Text>< username>

I give a 5 star to the whole dental office.  The have great customer service, the health and safety precautions they take during Covid is exceptional and the dentist is amazing.  I like that he uses high tech technology/equipment.  He is very good about explaining what you need done if you do need something done.  I have been going here for years and would definitely recommend this practice.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>**I actually look forward to going to the dentist, because everyone there is so enjoyable to be around.
I am a fairly new patient, and chose this practice among the many other practices out there, because of their warmth and friendliness over the phone. Fortunately, that same caring spirit holds true with them each time I walk in their office as they have displayed their desire to cater to my dental health in a convenient, responsible and affordable way.
If you are looking for a new practice, call up the wonderful ladies in the front office, and you will see why I knew instantly this was going to be the place for me :)</review>< pictures>

If you are looking for a caring dentist, Pak Dental is the best. I called complaining about jaw pain and they made time to see me right away, figure out my issue, and treat my pain.  I highly recommend Dr. Pak and his caring staff. It is worth visiting this amazing dental office.  The cleanings are gentle and Dr. Pak is very skilled.< /text>

Dr. Pak is a skilled and conscientious dentist. He does quality work at a reasonable price and seems genuinely interested in longterm satisfaction. I was pleased that he took so much time to place my crown to my specifications. Happy staff.</Review>

Doctor Pak is very considerate and prioritizes the patients' safety. He also makes sure his patients feel comfortable. In addition, Doctor Pak interacts and talks to his patients which creates a very friendly atmosphere. I look forward visiting this place again! :-)< /Text>

I've been to many dental offices in OC but I think he is the far BEST one I have ever came across. I've noticed he is very different from other dentists. He is very HONEST, skilled, and passionate doctor. I first went there to get my $39 new patient cleaning deal and be done with that office, but I ended up liking that office so much. I like the fact that Dr. Pak did not try to sell anything. Dr. Pak and his entire staff made me feel so comfortable (I'm terrified of the dentist) and earned my trust immediately. I highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for a dentist who you can trust.< /review>

I LOVED Dr. Pak and his friendly staff! Dr. Pak used to be an engineer so he is very meticulous with his dental work. As a perfectionist, he will make sure you get the best results possible for your teeth. I am very pleased with this office and I am definitely sticking with Dr. Pak.<//text>

Paid $85 for Dover Sole special, picked bones out of my teeth three times, get better cut of sole from supermarket. $400 w tip for two people. I don’t mind paying money for good food. This food does not nearly qualify for the price. Chocolate soufflé for desert was very ordinary. Service was very good.</text>

You will find dishes poorly seasoned, frozen hanging onto era of Hollywood  opulence on life support. You can look forward to small dishes that does not justify the price. Staff with prudent grins without smiles, slow service and nothing worth coming back to. Go here if you want to be bored, unsatisfied with your dining experience. Avoid this place at all costs.<//review>< response>

Polo Lounge isn't just a place to eat, it's a place to BE. Not just a lounge, but a tradition that dates back decades to the glory days of Old Hollywood. Yes, the food is awesome, the staff are warm and friendly, and it is a beautiful setting. But it's much more. You never know what old familiar faces you might see there. This is our favorite place to escape in Beverly Hills. I prefer table # 3 where Frank Sinatra used to sit when he and Barbara lived just around the corner on Foothill. You can see everybody coming in from there, which is exactly why he liked it! There are many great little cafes and high profile restaurants to eat in 90210, but Polo Lounge will forever be in a class by itself.</Text>

<text>We love this place. With 2 small kids it's hard to go to most brunch restaurants since most have tight spaces. Here you have open areas as well as indoor and outdoor places to sit with views of the marina. It's great because I can walk with my 3 yr old along the path by the water and there is always room for our stroller. The food is pretty good. I really like the breakfast enchiladas. Parking is 5 bucks for 3 hours. Afterwards we like to walk around or play at the nearby kids playground.< /text>< Pics>

I saw this restaurant on Selling Sunset and I needed to check this place out. I reserved a week in advance. This is important due to covid 19 precautions. The staff was very friendly and courteous. Valet parking is 15. French toast was delicious, could have had more powdered sugar. Filet Mignon with eggs was fantastic. Loved it! Overall, it was a great experience. Expect to pay over $100. Nice date option.< /Text>

If I could live at The Beverly Hills Hotel...I would be in Heaven! It is the most nostalgic hotel in all of Los Angeles! Iconic and far superior to any other hotels.  The food, staff and insanely lush landscape creates the perfect experience! The Polo Lounge is like stepping into a private and beautiful Mediterranean back yard! I honestly cannot say enough about the hotel especially how incredibly kind the staff is! They keep the old school chivalry going! Love, love, love everything about The Beverly Hills Hotel and the Polo Lounge! The food is a culinary delight!!<//text>

< Review>
Such a delightful treat to come here after months in quarantine. Polo lounge is a city treasure that has to be preserved especially with the highest integrity because of its history. Although they do have a strict dress code which is understandable and not attainable. Make sure to come here looking sharp because you truly deserve to pamper yourself.

We had such a great time with the live musician, the weather was on point, food was delicious and the staff are professional and respectful. We had a great chat with a few of the staff members and was amazed by the generosity to comp our chocolate soufflé. Definitely come back next week for Father's Day.< /Review>

Went here for our wedding anniversary and had white truffles for the first time. I could smell the truffle before the chef shaved it over my lobster risotto. A meal to remember!</review>

<Text>3 stars for ambiance and our server who was very knowledgeable and polite. However, the food was nowhere close to great. I ordered the organic free-range chicken that was so tough I needed a steak knife to cut through. The entire dish was equivalent to what you get at a banquet dinner. My friend’s steak had hardly any seasoning or taste to it. I also had to request water 3 times before someone finally brought it to the table. Overall, very underwhelming which was a bummer since we were looking forward to dining at the Polo Lounge. Cocktails were on point at least.
I’d go back for drinks but definitely not the food. ***I also work in the restaurant industry and always empathize with staff especially now during COVID***< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I had a wonderful experience here, the greeters and cashier were very pleases t and insured you had everything you needed for your order. The rattle snake wurst was hot and very flavorful, the large portion of hot dog bun proved inimical to the flavors of the crafted wurst though. Hopefully they can get a more curated bun to represent the craft wurst.<//Review>< rating>

<Text>Yeah! A place in Los Angels that actually has class and people not in club attire. This is the definition of a lounge. Nice room set up around a center bar with couches, tables and cushions against the walls as well as an additional back enclave. A great place to spend two or three or four hours talking with your friends. Happy hour goes until 9 PM and the bartenders are attentive and friendly. The bathroom is very clean. Valet right across the street for $7 (open til 3 am). No complaints!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2bc137b4aa0cb:0x80ebe0fe11ad2c9f< /GmapID></record>

Solid local brews and the sausages are delicious! Vegan chicken and apple will make you forget it's vegan...add the spicy aoli to kick up the flavor! If you want to indulge in the non vegan..street meat sausage is everything good about tast meat! Won't regret it. Cool, laid back vibe...worth a drive to Burbank.< /text>

It was our first time here enjoying Polo Lounge restaurant, and I must say we will definitely be back. Everything that we ordered was really good, the menu was well diverse, not to mention the drinks where flavorful and satisfying. At Polo Lounge  the service is excellent with smiles and enthusiasm. I would recommend taking the drive and be pleasantly surprised yourself.<//review>

Service was exceptional which one hopes for when paying top dollar. Our drinks were executed perfectly and super tasty. Dinner was pretty good, a bit pricey, so hoping for food that wowed a little more. Overall a fun experience.</Text>

Had lunch here on a weekday.  It was a great experience,  classic Beverly Hills, very iconic restaurant. The service was impeccable, the food was delicious, the setting was idyllic and the check reflected it. One of the highlights of our visit to the west coast. Be sure to see Frank Sinatra's table to left of piano as u come in, the Marilyn Monroe's to right surrounded by windows.<//Review>

I do a lot of business between LV and California, and when I'm in BH, I find myself at the Polo Lounge at BHH often. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and the cocktails are amazing. Above all, however, is the customer service. The staff is very attentive, and they go above and beyond to make sure you have the best experience.</text>

Where do I begin about this historic place, well first let’s say I’m glad we got the reservation. Definitely make reservations or you might not get lucky to get a table. As you walk in you can see and feel all of the history of the building. They have awesome old school phones in the lobby that works (calls the front desk)! Now for the food, we started with oysters that were really fresh. If the bread that they gave us was warm, it would have been better. I like the crouton bread best. For my entree I had the sea bass. I didn’t know it came with clams but that was a great surprise. Those to paired together was a mouthwatering hit! I got it with a side of brussel sprouts which was just okay. My friend got the lamb chops and ate it all with no complaints. Now for the best part, dessert. We split the Monroe. Where do I begin with this chocolate heaven. There’s chocolate cherry pieces in the ice cream, we loaded up with chocolate sauce. The cotton candy was the sugar rush on top. If you have the money, I say treat yourself!<//text>

I came here specially to try the Soufflé only, the lounge known for it, its by reservation only, so thanks for the kindly reception who helped us, the Palestinian hero, we ordered the chocolate Soufflé and the Soufflé of the day which was the Mix Chocolate and Cookies with Cappuccino to have the perfect experience, order it with additional vanilla ice cream ball.</Text>

The Beverly Hills Hotel and the world famous Polo Lounge is the gold standard.

If you have a meeting, schedule it here for brunch or lunch. Very comfortable setting. Expert staff.

It is going to take some improvements to get on the level of the Bourbon and Branch empire.  That being said, the space is nice and is a much needed addition to the neighborhood.  The placed was packed during happy hour on a Friday and seemed to empty out a bit after 8 pm.

<review>Alexis was exceptionally attentive. Anytime I thought l needed assistance she was there at my side. If you want an example of the highest level of attentive service, graciousness and kindness the Polo Lounge expresses this in spades.

The homemade seasonal eggnog cocktail was absolutely delightful. Also, I was able to order a single slider. The beef was a thin patty and yet they cooked it rare in the center. Quite a feat. Delicious!
Enjoy!

Such a lovely place .. It will definitely take you to the classic glam period. I would recommend spending your late afternoon at the Polo Lounge enjoying a snack and lovely live music. However, when it comes to the orders don’t miss their Chips, Salsa & Guacamole, Truffle Fries and Hollywood Romance Chocolate Cake. Delicious!!</Review>

$59 a person. Cuts and seasoning of the meats are fantastic. May not be for those who like light seasoning, salt and garlic. The garlic steak was the best for me (medium). The person who I went with says the place deserves a 5- that the filet mignon was one of the best and the pichana (spelling?) was really good too. All of it honestly tasted great. The only meat that was just alright was the pork ribs (a bit overcooked for me).< /Text>

Food was okay. The one shining spot was the Brussels sprout salad. We ended up ordering another one because the other meals weren't so great. Go for the salad, skip the rest.</review>

This place is excellent in every way. Iconic. Delightful. Perfect place to have an intimate dinner or gather for meet up with friends for dinner. Every waiter who has served us is friendly and experienced! Can’t leave without having a soufflé!</Text>

Their live music for brunch is delightful! Service, food and drinks are top notch. Such an iconic spot and overall experience. If you're in Beverly Hills don't miss it!</Text>

Food was amazing. Service was very good. The atmosphere was 100%. The experience was one of kind Hollywood or rather Beverly Hills. The drinks - can you believe they don't have Martini glasses here? Specialty drinks are great but the 4 stars is due to the lack of appropriate Hollywood glass to have a Martini. I recommend this 100%. 😁< /review>

What an exquisite place to come and enjoy a drink, or appetizer, or dinner and embossed with the upscale Beverly Hills crowd. It's great to be around successful people and like minded individuals who strive for the finer things in life. Great place to enjoy a wonderful day or night</Text>

<date>1581132718375< /date><rating>5< /rating><Review>Had such a blast on my first visit to the Polo Lounge. Anaele at the front was both welcoming and funny. Anaele if you see this you’re unreal. Blake our server was also accommodating, and Pepe near the front was good natured and fun. Honestly I can’t believe what a good time I had at what I thought would have been the type of place to put their nose up at me. Cocktails were all bomb and the food was good. Not enough ketchup with the burger (order a burger with ceased salad to see how sarcastic I’m being lol). Can’t wait to come back!</Review>< Pics>

Hollywood institution where the banquettes in the patio are the power tables to have breakfast and lunch at..waiters know you by name if you matter ..otherwise take a number and get in line . Food is consistent and typically Californian but their iced coffees are extremely good.< /text>

<text>If you want to feel you are in the lap of luxury for a thrill eat at the Polo Lounge. Be prepared it is going to cost - a lot - my breakfast was $60.00 but so worth it. The food was fabulous, the environment was heavenly, and my girlfriend and I talked for hours.  On our way out George Hamilton even walked it!

Service can be great or terrible, but still one of my go to’s. Great place for a quiet laid back lunch, where nobody care who you are. Make sure to have a reservation!!</Text>

<review>We had a nice burger here a bit away from the hustle & bustle of Tines Square. No A/C and it was crowded but we got a table without a wait on a Thursday night at 5:30 so we felt lucky. Service was great and a decent value for your money in Manhattan</review><GmapID>0x80c2bc137b4aa0cb:0x80ebe0fe11ad2c9f</GmapID>< Rating>

It was my worst experience ever.  The first moment I start taking video of the outdoor area and no one were sitting there, one of the waiters came to tell me “ No Videoing Here”. His way was rude and having the manager afterwards talking bout that it’s the policy of the hotel was about wired cause polices should be clear for visitors by at least having a sign saying this or the staff should be trained very well on how to approach the visitors about their policies..< /text>

The food is just ok nothing to rave about for such a fancy place. Fries tasted stale. Burgers were mediocre. Filet mignon was good but the fries with is are emaciated and the sauce is horrendous. The bread they gave was terrible and didn't taste fresh. The place is supposed to be elite yet the chairs are so uncomfortable and decor is so dated.

We definitely have eaten in way better places.<//Text>

If you want to see celebs this is the place. Really cool vibe here as well. Laid back but upscale. We saw Mariah Carey when we were here. Drinks are pricey.<//review>

I've never had a bad meal here.  Whether with friends here or from out of town..I can't remember a complaint.  Staff is attentive & go out of their way to make sure we have everything we need..will always go back until something seriously bad happens....I'll be coming a long time..<//text>

The inside room had a piano player whose music was so loud that, along with the other diners' chatter, made it impossible to have an enjoyable dining experience. I ordered the chopped salad that was chopped so finely and dressed do heavily that it was mush and was returned to the kitchen. The bill came to $250. Next time we will go to Spago for great food, ambiance and service.< /text><user_id>108882092749534325723</user_id><Time>1546668917873< /Time>< Pictures>

<review>Okay, so the service here is always slow. But I love dining here with my daughter. It’s one of her favorite spots.

I like the McCarthy salad, which the server chops up at the table. The oysters are always fresh. Burger is also very good. Desserts are photo worthy.</review></record></dataset><record>

Their Sunday brunch is a special experience everybody in Los Angeles should have at one point or another in life. It is complete with live entertainment, but walking though this historic hotel and learning about the impact it has had on Los Angeles (Beverly Hills is named after the hotel!) is a great just on its own. The service is second to none in the city of angels.< /Review>

The Sunday brunch food  was great , from the appetizer , main entree  & desserts. We made the right choices but not the drinks. The mimosa
was just okay & was offered another one.  Unfortunately, the 2nd glass was not on the Prix fixe menu & still not good.. Maybe , they should learn
to mix properly. The  brunch  was reasonably priced but not the extra
drinks.</review>

( But so was the price).. but WELL.worth it!! We stay here at least 4 to 6 times a year... Just the absolute best hotel in the WORLD!! Our last visit, we sit down in the Polo Lounge, and who sits next to us? Gordon Ramsey!! Do you watch L A listing? Josh Flagg was behind us!! Now I am not one to go nuts over seeing a celebrity, but it is pretty cool... We have seen multiple celebrities EVERY visit.. we just are so in LOVE with The Beverly Hills Hotel! Not to mention the staff.. We own a groom shop and we bring our pink Pomeranian Tilly, and as soon as we walk in, they say welcome back!! This trip, personalized treats with "Tilly" written on them, candy for the kids, and a bottle of champagne on ice for us!! Just AMAZING!!! This place makes anyone feel special!

Great breakfast place - though gay visitors may occasionally be stoned to death by order of the owner - Sultan of Brunei.  Haven't seen that myself, but imagine it would be distracting.<//review>

The burger was overcooked, and the fish had a funky smell. We would have brought this information to the server’s attention, but she never returned to the table. Considering the amount we paid for food and wine, we were extremely disappointed. I would have a difficult time recommending the Polo Lounge.<//review>

Had the Mcarthy Salad and was completely satisfied. Of course the service was above average. I've been coming here since the 90's, and the prices have only gone up about 5%</text>

A place to be seen. The waybu burger was really good. This place is pricey however. You can get better food elsewhere and for less money.< /Text>

A classic spot, vintage like the scotch they serve. Like taking a step into old Hollywood when you go for a drink at the Beverly Hills Hotels famous bar.

Famous for Hollywood power lunches but open and reasonably priced for everyone.

A must do for those visiting L.A. for business or pleasure.

Was cool when your grandma was around, just as cool now.< /Text>

Food, drinks, bartender Josh, and service was amazing. The hostess however was extremely rude to us. Even though we had a reservation outside she insisted we couldn't sit outside even though there were clearly open tables. I recommend this place for the experience however I may not go back based on the rudeness of the staff.</review>

Food was good really good, bread was great, ran into Sandra Bullock as we entered (its that kinda place), atmosphere was amazing, and packed. You have to pay for such an experience. If you have to look at the prices you don't dine here. Dinner was over $900 for 4 people.</review>

<review>You know you are eating at the Polo Lounge, when the ketchup your truffle fries are served with becomes the centerpiece of conversation.

You know you are eating at the Polo Lounge, when the chopped salad you are eating has actually been chopped.

You know you are eating at the Polo Lounge, when the butter that comes with your bread is served at ideal butter knife temperature.

You know you are at the Polo Lounge, when your Negroni is made correctly, is served with a single, crystal clear ice cube, and reminds you that sometimes more expensive is actually more better.

One of my favorite haunts, the Polo lounge...this wonderful place is filled with celebs of all structures of the Hollywood inner circle...it's a who's, who of fashion, film, music and adventure travelers. The staff is second to none and very customer oriented...they make everyone feel welcomed and thats why this is my #1 pick on my insiders view of Hollywood for food and entertainment in a relaxed and sophisticated atmosphere.</Text>

Once you pass the snobby front door and actually get a table, then the good times begin. Delicious cocktails, Mediocre food and lots of star sighting. I do like the lobster salad there, and the staff can be quiet nice after you leave them a nice tip and keep coming back!<//text>

Had a great time here with some friends for a Saturday brunch!  The seared tuna BLT was delicious but small, but my wife's tuna tartare was less spectacular--the seaweed salad was clearly artificially colored.  Everything is very overpriced, obviously :)</Text>

The first room is dark , is that whether to the lighting or the carpet is up to debate.

The second room or the patio is brighter and sunnier  , although it did not have table umbrellas if requested

Importantly their is an over emphasis on souces to prep up the food offering.

Although the souces used does not encourge ones appetite,  and they do not look that fresh either.

Iam sure that the Polo lounge had better days<//Text>

Breakfast was amazing.  The lobster eggs benedict will change your idea of  what breakfast should be.  I highly recommend the Blueberry Lavender drink as well.<//review>

Great place to relax and take your time eating, visiting and chilling whether you're inside the lounge or out on the beautiful patio. Service can be a little slow, but the food is great.<//text>

Fine lunch spot with outdoor seating, basic menu, ordered the burger, which was fresh and incredibly filling. This place is known for its cocktails, but the latte was also surprisingly good.< /Review>

Over this place.  Used to be a frequent guest.  Quality, value, service and of course the crowd has gone down to such an embarrassing level.  Their new policies and beliefs under the new ownership are so discriminatory and putrid I just refuse to go or recommend it to anyone.  t's just not cool anymore.  NEXT!</Review>

A landmark location to be seen or see who you can see.  Outragiously expensive and portions are decent sized.  Wait staff is attentive and knowedgable.  Not your typical hotel dining room.  Regulars love the patio or the large booths.</text>

<Review>Just a horrible and embarrassing experience that was a waste of our time.  Quite honestly not worth it.  Having paid the bill I purposely did not leave a tip, for we had received mediocre food and astonishingly bad service.  I was followed out by the waiting staff to be told that as a foreigner (and she was from the Far East) I did not understand that I HAD to tip them.  She actually demanded that I pay her the tip outside the restaurant.  Urgghh, stay away.<//Review><Time>1371733350166< /Time><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc137b4aa0cb:0x80ebe0fe11ad2c9f</Gmap_id>< user_name>

<Text>If you want the LA celebrity scene, this is it. The Polo lounge is the restaurant in the Beverly Hilton and is prototypical Beverly Hills. Great service and they even had a one man xmas band entertaining during dinner. The food was excellent and the sommelier Nino had an encyclopedic knowledge of California wines. I highly recommend the Smoked Balik Salmon, it's unbelievable and the best salmon I've ever had. The oysters on ice are great but I'm not much for Oyster shooters personally. When it comes to entrees, get the Pappardelle, it was delicious. Literally, lick the plate savory sauce, it took all my will power to hold back. For the close, I took advantage of the deconstructed s'mores which was great but not quite the same caliber as the salmon or pappardelle. Rumor has it that this place is even better for brunch, I'm definitely going back.< /Text>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>(Translated by Google) We stayed 4 nights at the Beverly Hills Hotel during our honeymoon and ate in the Polo Lounge on two nights. The food was very good (had the best tartare ever - was prepared by the waiter at the table) and the service was very professional. The prices were appropriate to the hotel, but that was not unexpected. Found celebrities on both nights. Had a large wine list and delicious cocktails. The atmosphere was very pleasant (in our case also romantic in the evening) and there was very subtle background live music on both evenings.

Wir waren während unserer Hochzeitsreise 4 Nächte im Beverly Hills Hotel und haben an zwei Abenden in der Polo Lounge gegessen. Das Essen war sehr gut (hatte dort das beste Tartar ever - wurde vom Kellner am Tisch zubereitet) und der Service sehr professionell. Die Preise waren auch dem Hotel entsprechend, aber das war nicht unerwartet. Haben an beiden Abenden Promis angetroffen. Hatten eine große Weinkarte und leckere Cocktails. Die Atmosphäre war sehr angenehm (in unserem Fall am Abend auch romantisch) und an beiden Abenden gab es sehr dezente Hintergrund-Livemusik.<//Text>< pics>

Staff are extremely kind and helpful. They definitely know their stuff. The places is small but packed with great items. Everything you need to start your skateboard journey or for a continuous skater. Shop seems like a great hang out place as well.

It was a big drive to get there but definitely worth it. Will be a frequent visitor for sure!< /Text>

Nice skateboarding and Scooter store, with knowledgeable staff. It is hard to find a store that carries good scooters, and this place is great!<//Review>

< Review>
Street Science did a killer job of helping me get a old school deck built up.  Because I’m also part of an independently owned business I decided that I was going to seek out a local shop and not go online.  They were able to tell me that my original trucks wouldn’t fit and that I needed some stiffer bushings, and saved me a bunch of time because they knew what they were doing.  I’d be glad to recommend them again!< /Review>

<Text>This place is good skateboards, but defiently not scooters. The service was not very well the person working there was rude and the return policy is odd. There was a misunderstanding and ended up wasting 40 dollars on a scooter clamp. Also to use their half pipe they charge 5 dollars and there’s large cracks which makes it very dangerous and not as comfortable. I do not recommend.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1588687608087, 'text': 'Hi Matt, we appreciate the feed back. Sorry if your experience wasn’t up to par. Our return policy is if a part does not appear used and we can resell it we exchange for store credit. There are a few seams that need repair on the ramp but we ride it regularly and a few worn surface sheets does not make it dangerous. The few worn sheets will be replaced soon as we are in the middle of a ramp resurfacing . Send me a email shop@street-sci.com explaining what day you came in and what went wrong with the scooter exchange and Il make it right, and I’d be happy to shoot you a ramp pass for when the ramp repairs are complete. 👍'}< /Response>

The shop is very friendly they help you out picking decks and parts if your a beginner and I recommend going their with your kid that wants to skate but you don’t know anything about it I would even go their just to hang out they have a mini ramp/quarter pipe to skate in the back even during quarantine they have good selection and good service I would go their again<//Review>

David here,

Over the last decade I have been looking at the skeletal remains of my once proud skateboard, constantly telling myself to fix it up and get back to the sport I once loved so well. So today I did it, went into Street Science for a whole new setup, right off the bat MacKenzie welcomed me in and started guiding my way through the new brands.

I was amazed to find out all of my tried and true brands were dust in the wind, sold out to walmart and suffered huge reduction in quality, but MacKenzie was a big help in finding me the right deck for me (I felt bad because she took down about 15 and had to put them back up). In the end I got a really nice finished product that I look forward to testing on the streets. Still the same prices I grew to expect years ago which was a big plus. Awesome time today and I will be coming back for sure.

P.S. they give half pipe/vert lessons starting at $40 which is great for kids.</text>

i'm a skater, 41 years and still rollin' ... i've learned who represents the sport, and carries that to the next level through owning a local skate shop ;)

skating IS local, by definition, yet it also is a lifestyle, so running a small shop as well as Street Science does is a testament to their owner Jeremy Morgan.

i'm honored to have skated with jeremy for well over 10 years, he's a true friend and genuinely nice guy ... it's great to see the shop succeed, every once in a while the world does make everything perfect !</review>< Pics>

<Text>I brought my daughter to the Lake Elsinore location for an oral surgery consult and was very impressed with the staff. The front office staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. The dentist and his team were informative and took the time to answer all of my questions. Making an appointment was also easy and they got us in quickly. It seems they work hard at treating their patients well.<//Text>< pics>

Scheduled my appointment for wisdom teeth only to go there and have them tell me I have to wait another 2 weeks. The girls at the front dest are very unprofessional. Work dentist office I’ve ever been to. Horrible experience so far. Would not recommend this this place to anyone!! 👎<//review>

<pics>None<//pics><text>Made an appointment over a week in advance and provided all my info including insurance. Got a couple reminder emails and a confirmation call the day before. Show up early to my appointment just to be told that they tried calling my insurance and they didn't answer and can't verify. Of course they didn't answer, it's Saturday! When asked why they couldn't have verified a week ago when I made the appointment, I was told they normally do this the day before and they were just really busy. I can understand that but what made it worse was the fact that I wasted my time going into the office when they could have called me to inform me of this issue. While at the office and when I called back to speak to someone in billing, they didn't even offer to reschedule, not that I would go back. Worst experience.< /text><UserId.>101833336714220505438</UserId.>< GmapID>

This was my first time here and let me tell you,  the hygienist there, loved her energy! She was super super sweet but got straight to the point, kinda like a mother scolding you about the importance of your teeth but also just wanted to comfort you and make sure you’re okay. Everyone else that helped me whether it was the front desk or an dental assistant was also super helpful and nice!  Only thing was dentist forgot to sign my prescription and didn’t really talk or explain that much. Overall a great experience! Super kid friendly as well!  Definitely would recommend.< /review>

The place was great but could use more chairs and the staff were very nice. Though I have one compliant about the place and it's the long wait time you have to endure. Other then that the place was great would be five stars if the wait time was shorter<//review>

<Text>Dr. Santos and Emily are an amazing team that I had experience with today. They made sure I was comfortable, explained each step, and listened to me.  They spent quite a few hours on my teeth and did a great job. I really loved that they did an x-ray after my fillings were complete to make sure they were good to go. I’ve never been to a dental office that actually made sure the work was done right before the patient left. Because of that, I’ve had to have a few fillings redone, but I can rest assured that the fillings I receive today are all the way down like they should be. I have to come back for the other side to get done and, even though dental work makes me very anxious and terrified, I know I’m in good hands for my next appointment. Thank you for the great work you did!<//Text>< response>

Do not come here! I went there for my initial checkup and took 3 hours. They messed up X-rays and had to redo them and they left me sitting in the dental chair waiting without telling me anything. Two days later. My wife went for her initial checkup. Appointment was set for 12pm and when she got there they told her that the dentist is on lunch and to come back at 2pm. She came back at 1:40pm to check in. 2:30pm still not checked in and she asked how much longer to be told we are about to call your insurance.... 3pm and still waiting to be called back. Worst dental office I’ve ever seen.</Review>

Worst dentist office I’ve ever been to. Hour and a half wait time before you even go to the back then another hour of sitting before the dentist even sees you. If work is needed instead of getting it done they shedule you for a week later.<//review>

Dr. Santos and R-DA Joerie helped me today with my RTC and crown. It took about 4 hours to hollow out the tooth and remove the nerves, and fill it to fit a temporary. They were super patient, helped me understand the process, and made sure I felt an absolute minimum of pain. I am super thankful to this Western Dental and its staff for helping me to correct decades of neglect and doing so with compassion.< /Review>

<review>So today I was experiencing pain with one of my teeth so I called online and made an appointment at the lake Elsinore western dental and lady on the phone was nice however when I arrive to my appointment 20 minutes early filled out my paperwork five minutes before my appointment time for 4 PM giving them ample time to conduct the paperwork and the appointment however they had me sitting in my vehicle for 45 minutes after my appointment time at 4 PM So I then walked into the western dental and asked the lady when will be my appointment be conducted and I noticed that they had literally completed all of the other appointments that had come in after me and had me sitting in my car waiting patiently for no reason this place is The most incompetent dentistry I have ever come across in my entire life I would not recommend this place to anyone.<//review>< date>

My appointment was at 11:45, and I  was waiting for 30 minutes after that they told me that the doctor was going on  her lunch,  and I have to come back at 2:30 pm , that make me so upset because if they don't have any doctor available why make people's appointments at time, just making people waste their time</review>

Every movement and every difference between my last Ortho appointment and today's appointment is explained to me also in an  understanding and appreciated way. I love and appreciate Western Dental & Orthodontist in Lake Elsinore.

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>I had an appointment at 11, I came at 1030 to do paperwork since I was a new patient.   I showed up, not one person at the desk said anything to me.   I stood there for 10 minutes to check in and receptionists were not on the phone or anything.  I finally said something, they gave me my paperwork I completed and gave it to them.   When I was trying to give it to them, I noticed they left my identification laying out on the counter with my PII for anyone to see, I handed them the clipboard with my paperwork and handed them my identification for a second time.   I told them I would waiting in my vehicle, left my phone number go call and I waited an hour.   I went into office at 1200PM.   I asked how long, one receptionist said she would ask.   She went back and didn't address me again.   10 minutes later, I asked another receptionist.  She went back and she said 15 minutes, apologized and said there was a medical emergency which caused doctors to be backed up.  I said okay but I am not waiting any longer than 15 minutes because that would make it 2 hours I have been waiting PLUS there were people who had appointments at the same time or after my scheduled appointment who were called back.   I left and will never do business there again as this is not the FIRST time but SECOND time this had been done to us.  The first time was when my daughter had a cleaning scheduled.   My issue is if there is a significant delay then the front desk staff should be communicating with patients that there is a delay.   Additionally, the front desk staff is horrible with customer service, do not welcome their patients and are very slow and wreckless with documents.   I would not recommend going there at all.   PERIOD.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I really would not recommend this office at all. I had a 9:00 appointment and one at 11. I was not seen till around 10 for my first appointment. The staff seemed very ill informed of my information even though I’ve been a patient here for over a year now. After some x-rays I was then taken to a room...then another....then another...and one more to sign papers and then I was sent to wait outside. It is now 11:26 and I haven’t had any work done at all for my first appointment. This office seems severely understaffed and appointments take a while for you to be seen. I hope that one day this office can improve its staff and stay on time with appointments that we (the patients) schedule weeks prior to visiting.<//review>< gmap_id>

<text>I went to get my teeth cleaned and I had the most wonderful hygienist .Her name is Victoria. Her work was top-notch! God bless you 👍.  I went for another appointment today and the waiting time was not bad at all!  Again I had a very good experience . I got to see  Victoria again and had a wonderful dentist . He did terrific work and made me feel so comfortable! A very nice person! I definitely recommend Western dental.</text>< Date>

Today I had a fast and smooth experience at western dental. I was treated so nicely by the whole staff, and Emily was by far the best. She answered every question I had and made sure my nervous daughter was comfortable through the whole process. Thank you Emily and western dental for great experience here. We will see you soon. :)<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Let's start from least problematic to worse:

1) Phone staff was rude and uninformed. They insisted that I didn't need an appointment to pick up dental trays when I in fact did and had to tell the poor office staff I wasn't leaving until they got them to me.

2) They were always at least an hour if not two hours late getting me back there.

3) After getting me back there they would numb me up and then have me sitting waiting alone in the chair long enough for it to wear off, almost another hour, so then they would have to numb me up again. This happened every single time until I was fed up and walked out in the middle of an appointment.

4) I was still having pain issues on the side of my face they told me was finished so I went to another dentist only to have them tell me the decay was so bad that I was going to need a couple root canals.

Do not go here.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

If I could it would be zero.

Extremely long waits.

Rude staff.

They tell you a procedure will be done, to have you show up, then reschedule on you for a month out.<//Review>

Western Dental will do work on good teeth. They over charge. They lie, I had a loose crown and was told I have a Cavity and the tooth needs to be pulled. I went to another dentist and he told me the tooth was cracked.and their was no Cavity.  The tooth had to be pulled no matter what. I was told because I was on chemo it happened. Western Dental was going to charge me $450 do do the work. The dentist I had it done at charged me $240.
I learned that western dental will lie and do work that doesn't need to be done. They told me I need a implant and it would be $4,500 the dentist I went to could do it for less then half. If your thinking about going to western dental go somewhere else. You can a lot of money if you don't go to western dental.<//review>

Don't go here. Assistants were gossiping about my daughter because she had a wisdom tooth finally come in that had been impacted for years. Due to a disease she had to have all her teeth pulled at 28 yrs old. Dentist told her the wisdom tooth was so far up it would be best to just let it come in a pull when it did. She moved since and after 4yrs the tooth finally came in, bad, hurting and she went to have it pulled. She knew the assistant was gossiping about her because she kept saying the girl with only 1 tooth. Doctor gave my daughter Motrin and antibiotic and said she shouldn't need anything more than that. I guess they assumed she was a drug addict or something and therefore don't deserve pain relief. As if anyone would go to a dentist to get a fix. So she probably won't return for the check up because they made her feel so bad about herself as if she has anything to be ashamed of. So if you need a tooth pulled, I wouldn't suggest this place, apparently they don't believe in pain relief..also They all didn't know what the other was doing or supposed to be doing, disorganized, one assistant on phone with hubby on speaker phone, actually dropped a few f bombs and was so loud I'm sure the people in the lobby heard the whole conversation as well. My daughter said that also made her even more nervous. Very disappointed in the office. The receptionist talked to me like I was idiot, when I told her we have ibuprofen at home. She went onto Tell me well the doctor gave Motrin and it's not the same thing as ibuprofen and it's stronger. Lol Motrin is a brand name of Ibuprofen lol they are exactly the same, just like Advil is  ibuprofen. I've been a nurse for 30+ yrs. I know more than she does about medicines and healthcare</Text>

Don't do business with them i always heard bad stuff about wanted to find out for myself so i went and they are just about selling products and making their numbers. They fo a very good job at convening you to buy their products I and had bad reaction to it took it the Only guy that works in the office Raul said he would give me a refund and said give it a week to be refunded so i did the following week nothing and so every we were going back and forth this all started in February so now 3 months nothing got done especially with this Covid 19 so the financing company is still trying to bill me and now I have to wait for this dam office to open. Very BAD customer service and especially their accounting office I have proof that they were supposed to give me refund so be careful they are ALL BAD NEVER AGAIN< /review>

Extremely long wait times even with an appointment. We have gone a number of times and have always stayed more than 2 hours and the time they tended to us was only about 30 minutes. Staff is limited. Office is not very tailored to children in terms of waiting area and rooms. Other offices usually have toys or themed rooms for kids to feel more at ease.</Review>

<Text>I did waited a long time before being taken back to a room but once they checked my daughter they explained everything in detail about her treatment. Dr. Santos was amazing with my daughter , she was really scared and Dr. Santos was very patient and caring with her as well as his assistant Olivia , they did a wonderful job with the tooth extraction without the laughing gas . I was very pleased everyone in the office were nice and polite. Thank you.< /Text>< user_name>

I am happy to review Marissa to show my gratitude towards her. Marissa is an awesome Tech, she is very caring and professional at what she does, she was very gentle and explained everything to me. She made my fear a little more at ease. Thank you Marissa!
See you soon< /Review>

OK, here's a detail. An appt was made for my granddaughter approx one month ago to tighten her braces, check up, etc. I make arrangements to pick her up, drive her over and take care of business. Our appts for 3 pm. No one is there and it is closed. What kind of place are you people running? You don't even have the common courtesy and professionalism to pick up the phone and cancel. We just paid 10,000 for her braces, but you can't be bothered to call us and reschedule?   What a joke.< /review>

I do not recommend this office or western dental in general.  I feel like my situation was taken advantage of and I was sold products that do not help me and the product makes my teeth even more sensitive.  I called to ask about a refund and was told no.  I also asked why the dentist would sell me a product that would make my already very sensitive teeth even more sensitive they had no response.  Also would like to mention that when i was placed in the room for my cleaning I sat down and all of the instruments there were clearly used and dirty so they had not cleaned up before putting me in the room.  Gross!!!!!!!! I had to say something.  They came in and cleaned it.  I watched the dentist scold the tech for it.  So I won't be going back.  Nasty place that just wants your money.  No personal attention here it's like a Walmart of dentist offices.<//text>

<Text>I had a great experience with Melissa Valdez and Dr. Yong Lai. I was worried that I wouldn’t have the chance to get my braces removed before my graduation and I was right. The only time they had available was after the date. However, they both were sweet enough to understand my concerns and went out of their way to schedule me before then! I’m very pleased with their experience and excited that I get to experience a perfect smile on my special day.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>DOCTOR SANTOS YOU'RE THE BEST!!!!
Finally...after 12 years, I'm in one of the best facilities, with SOME of the most awesome employees, and in one of the best talented hands and Dentist Doctor in the riverside and San Bernardo counties ever. Don't ever HARDLY have to wait especially if I have an appointment, the lady's are polite and nice, and as for the Doctor is talented because his hands gentle, he cares for his patients, and I feel like he puts good quality care with the time and the way he applies towards all my Dental care needs</Review>< Gmap_id>

This office gave this old, grizzled senior citizen and 'Nam Vet outstanding dental care and Emily was extremely helpful. However they do a very poor job of keeping you informed concerning exactly what procedure they are going to perform.<//text>

DON’T COME HERE. Rude people, they try to take your money and over charge you. Took me 4 years to get my braces off when initially it was only going to be 2 1/2 years. They kept telling me write a good review for them because they have terrible service. Don’t come here the staff is extremely rude, way too much wait time every time I go and not worth the money. Definitely DO NOT recommend for anyone.< /text>

I went into the office unsure and feeling embarrassed that my teeth weren't as perfect as they were in my younger years. Stephanie not only walked me through all my payment options , she reassured me that I would be that beautiful confident woman I once was with a beautiful smile. I couldn't say thank you enough Stephanie. I walked in embarrassed and emotional and walked out positive, happy, and optimistic about my dental treatment.<//text>

I showed up with my 3 kids. Our appointment was at 9 and 9:30 am, the lady on the phone the day before told me to show up 15 mins to fill out new patient paperwork. We showed up about 20 mins and we walked in. The lady at the counter told me we weren’t allowed to be in the building before 9 am. I said okay I have to fill out new patient paperwork she said if your in here then other people will come in. So we went outside and waited the 20 mins in the cold. Once it came to 9 we came in I filled out the paper work and they didn’t take my first child back until 9:30. Even tho our appointment was at 9. When I asked her why they told me to come in early she said the call center messes up all the time. To me I felt that wasn’t my fault and why did I have to wait in the cold outside with 3 kids. And when she said people would come in if we did, no one showed up at all the whole time we were outside. I will never use them again. They put a bad vibe and they obviously don’t care about patients.</review>

Do NOT go here. I went here with my wife for a simple exam and we were both later scheduled for appointments we did not make or want. If we did not show up to them, they would have charged us $25 for a no show! Also, this office refused to clean our teeth because they told us that our insurance would not cover for an intermediate cleaning, which is the only thing they would do. What a scam! They are all about selling things that you do not need and not working with you and your insurance. BEWARE. Also, they charged our insurance for fluoride application, which they did NOT do. When we asked about it, they said just sign it, you don't have to pay. Um, well someone does.<//Text>

Very caring very good dentists. My oral surgeon was awesome... he made sure I was medicated enough so that I wouldn’t feel any pain. He answered all my questions that I asked with compassion. I’m sure glad that I found this place. They were there when I needed them for my extraction. Thank you Western Dental... ❤️❤️❤️</review>

<text>I waited 2 hours just to be told that they are going to have to reschedule me because they are too busy also the doctor didn’t tell me I had any cavities but his assistant told me I had 2 cavities and then the lady who had me fill out paper work told me I had 4 cavities mind you they didn’t even check my teeth thoroughly I canceled the appointments they rescheduled me for I’m never going back there again I waiting soo long to not have any service provided to me and for them just to lie and try to over charge me for things I didn’t need. Save your time and don’t go here it’s the worst dentist I’ve ever been to.<//text></record>

Absolutely ridiculous! Appointment was at 12pm and it was 2pm and they have yet to call my son in. Three different patients also left for the same reason. Why book an appointment every 15 minutes if that slow doctor can't even handle seeing one patient per hour. Do not waste your time!< /review>

Isis was amazing. My mouth was (is) jacked and she was sooo very gentle. The front office was also Really nice even at the end of the day. Thank you all for everything. This was a year ago,. I still have the exact pain I had whenever I came. Have paid for a surgery that I have not received for a root canal. I will say my schedule has been tuff to say the least due to Covid but I hope after 3100 and a appointment on Monday, that I can finally get set up to have and attraction and have a bill cut from my life. For future reference, avoid the up sells until after you actually do the original work requested.!!!<//review>

< review>
I felt like I was at a car dealership. I went for a tooth ache. Was more interested in selling me all the add on products than dealing with my tooth. I still haven’t heard anything about my tooth that needs pulled but I got a call from the orthodontist department. I told the dentist I had no desire to get braces. I am 37 years old I could care less. Completely unprofessional. I will not go back.<//review>

<Review>Isis is totally great! Patient, kinda, social able, very knowledgeable and please let’s not forget peppy! She  has the kind of energy I would love everyone in the office to have and bring more brightness to the dental office! I enjoyed my visits here with Dr. Shaw throughout the years though I had ceased my visits for about 7 months due to the lack of customer service and empathy of their front office receptionist. And now I am back again and I have noticed new faces in the front and I do hope that their demeanor And customer service with their ( I am hoping ) extensive knowledge of processing patients is better than that of the last woman whom worked here. Great Ortho.. very good with kids. Fast and friendly. Thank you for all that you provide here at western dental isis and Doctors! Doctor Shaw and Doctor Santos are so kind, patient, empathetic, knowledgeable and let’s not forget very compassionate about his work!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

But they’ll make you waste an hour before they tell you. I wrote on the sign in sheet Invisalign, only to have the VERY RUDE Asian dentist give me attitude. He was absolutely rude and intolerable. I told him I’m looking for a price quote and he then proceeded to snap at me and mention many times “oh you’re just here for a price that’s it huh”. Very rude and unprofessional. NEVER coming to a Western Dental again. AVOID THIS LOCATION and that dentist. He didn’t even say sorry btw, but his assistants were very sorry and also super sweet, nothing bad to say about them. But dear dentist, I’m not upset I wasted an hour of my life on a weekend, I’m upset that you were so disgusting and rude.< /Text>< pictures>

<name>Mike C< /name><review>Don't go there! Don't go there! Don't go there! Important things are to be repeated for 3 times, The dentist is very nice,but the system is very poor. Half past three appointment, let's wait until five, Three people came after us,all of them had be checked in before us. This is totally unreasonable and destructive behavior. It used to be a very good dentist's office, I hope they can improve this bad system and continue to serve the community.</review>< rating>

I have been here about 6 times so far in the last 2 months and the experience has been great each time ....ISIS and OLIVIA are great. I have a fear of the dentist AND a difficult 4yr old. BUT they were able to have patience and actually get him to participate in the visit. Isis has been great at every appointment with my kids and she is a great at her job. Olivia was great during the different procedures with the dentist.... (3stars because no follow thru with callbacks.....the person in charge of insurance and all that has no idea what she is doing and the lack of communication between her and her partner is frustrating. ...also one of the girls at the desk was more interested in peeling her nail polish off than setting up an appt...very unprofessional and unsanitary. Glad Im done here)< /Text>

I went to another dentist they said no I only need 1 root canal! The dentist I saw was very rude and you could just tell he did not care! I would not recommend this dentist to my worst enemy.

DO NOT GO HERE!! THEY ARE A BUNCH OF SCAMMERS. Was told by dentist I had cavities, so went somewhere else and had them checked and I had no cavities. Money hungry people trying to perform unneccesary procedures. Also mocked me when I was terrified of being there. The assistant was making rude jokes. Will not be back. DO NOT GO TO WESTERN DENTAL!<//review>

My appoint was at 2:30 and it’s now 3:44 and have still not been seen other than xrays. I have to take anxiety meds to been seen and they have a short life. The X-ray tech Isis was amazing and gentle when doing my xrays. I would come back just for her. The workers are nice but aren’t very helpful about getting you in on your appointment. We told them we had to be out by four which should have been plenty of time. My appointment was at 2:30 and my husbands was at 3. It’s now almost 4 and neither of us have been seen. The people are nice but their office is not very organized and they need to staff more dentists to get through their appointments</Text></record></dataset><record>

Its honestly very hard to take dental advise from a doctor with black gums and rotten teeth stench on his breath. Charged me over $600 for a cleaning that they said wasnt covered by my insurance. Found out that is the same cleaning other places do under the insurance.  Tried to SELL ME BRACES and I HAVE STRAIGHT NICE TEETH.  Straight scammers here. Sucking that insurance dry by selling you anything they can that is covered by insurance and if they think they can squeeze an extra buck out of you theyll suggest more unnecessary dental work.< /text>

< Review>
I first want to say that the ladies in the front were very helpful and kind.  This is why I even gave it a 3 star.  I waited over an hour and a half before even getting to see the doctor.  I was very patient and when I asked about the long wait the receptionist brought my 3 year old something to color with.  The lady who took the xrays was really good with my kids too.  The doctor was with us for 60 seconds! He spent no time with us at all.  Then when the lady was cleaning my son's teeth my daughter was asking to sit down because she was tired (we had been there for two hours at this point) and I was holding a chair for her to get up into so she could sit down.  The doctor came over rudely and told me I had to go into the waiting room with my daughter until my son was done.  First of all, I will not be leaving my son! This is why I come here because everything is open and I have always been allowed to stay with my kids the entire time.  Then, he says she couldn't sit so I took her off the seat and pushed the chair towards him and said fine.  He got mad at me because I'm sure I was frustrated at this point.  I told him how I have been very patient at this point and didn't deserve this type of service.  He says "we are trying to help your kids" and he also said "what if she falls?"  I told him that I am a mom if 5 and I know how to take care of my kids.  Remember that I was holding the chair and standing right next to my child when she was trying to sit down! He insisted on me waiting in the waiting room and I refused.  I gave him his chair and stood there until my son was done.  It isn't the fact that she couldn't sit in the chair so much as the way he talked to me.  I am clearly not an ignorant women without common sense.  He spoke to me as if I wasn't taking care of my kids.  I was very offended by him and he was extremely rude.  He even started talking about me and said "I hate when parents..." to the lady in the room next to us.  What happened to customer service?!? I'm a restaurant manager and if my staff ever treated a customer this way, they would fired.  Tray people with respect.  If had explained patiently why she wasn't able to sit there or talked to me as an adult rather then treated me like a child, I would have understood.<//Review>

This is the WORST place i have ever been to. Such an inconvenience of me and my husbands weve taken time off work to get my husband teeth pulled first time the so called specialist was so RUDE to the point he walked out while my husband was trying to asking him a question about have to get a bone graph. We still gave them a chance came back to what was supposed to be different specialist got called to front desk to pay 1000$ before anything was even DONE!! That was not going to happen! At this point we found out its the same specialist we had a bad experience with was the one that was going to work on my husband. NOPE! That was not going to fly. So today was the last chance we came in for a 1:00 appointment sat for 36 min just to be told he needed to see a different specialist! WHAT! Were going to get a second opinion because this is ridiculous!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

Worst experience ever. 3 hours first appointment, my 14 year old was numbed 4 times because it took so long in between injections, second appointment waited for 30 mins before we were even called back. Was thinking about braces here. Never gonna happen.< /Text>

For sure doesn't deserve this one star! I am new to the area and refused to pull my teeth because I didn't have the physical dental card. I had my picture ID, dental card number, and social security card as "requested" by the person who set up my appointment. I scheduled my appointment on Friday and I made it very clear I didn't have my card. She told me to just bring my social security card and picture ID. I called off work to make this appointment. All they keep saying is it's a part of our policy and blah blah. And for billing. There's no way you can only verify coverage by having the physical card. ANNOYING, beyond frustrating, and a total waste of my time.

P.s. Do not respond with your generic automotive message.< /review>

<Review>WHEN THEY FIRST OPENED, THEY WERE GREAT!  SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE THINGS HAVE CHANGED.  NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE OR THE DENTIST THAT IS THERE NOW.  HE IS VERY RUDE.  THE WORST IS THE PRICES THEY WANT TO CHARGE.  SO, TODAY WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT THERE TO GIVE THEM ANOTHER CHANCE, I WAS READING THE REVIEWS & CHANGED MY MIND, I'D RATHER GIVE A CHANCE TO ANOTHER DENTIST.  COULD SAY MORE, BUT I'D BE WRITING A BOOK.< /Review>< name>

This place suck. Everytime we went there alway more than 1 hr wait. Try to give this place a chance but its never get better. The dentist there not even know what he doing he told me i have 7 cavity and a root canal then i went to another dentist to get a second opinion. I only have 2 small cavity and no need for root canal. Don't go there stay away from that place.< /Review>

<Text>They don't even deserve the one star. I am very upset about the fact that I can't take my daughter to the doctor/dentist without her freaking out. My 2 1/2 year old needed two root canals and caps put on her front teeth along with a bunch of other work so they strapped her down and gave her laughing gas at the time I was pregnant so I could not be in the room. My poor baby was screaming the whole time a professional would have stopped and went and told the parent they could not do the work. I would never return and I will also not be paying them the $700 for the white caps since you should have not continued in the first place. I will keep it for  every time I have to bear hug my daughter to get anything done in the future.<//Text><Rating>1</Rating>< pics>

Waited 1hour and a half. Dentist never came into my daughter room. All they did was x-rays and have us wait just to tell us it would be another 30min to be seen. Seriously like if waiting 1hour and a half wasn't long enough. Don't recommend this place.</Text>

< Review>
This is the WORST EXPERIENCE  ever. I went to go get my braces done in October of last year. I was told very vague  info and the doc still put brackets on my teeth then sent me over to the other side to find out I have to pay 2000 for a freaking root canal. So I'm stuck with brackets and freaking KNOWING I can't pay 2000. TOTAL SCAM these docs are so ridiculous I could and will never ever come here again. Idk anyone in their right minds that would SCREW SOMEONE over that bad. HORRIBLE SERVICE. not to mention I got billed still for the BRACKETS AND NO BRACES. AHAHA wow nothing fixing my teeth and still want to charge me!! Hmmm.<//Review>
