There was smelly rat poison in my storage unit when I opened it for the first time, presumably because they’re fighting a rat problem. I saw no other signs of rats so I think it was working. It sometimes got a little crowded there, but I was always able to get a flatbed cart to help ferry my stuff between my car and the storage unit. There is a restroom in the office that you can use.<//Text>< date>

<review>I just needed a few weeks for a move and Jula was very friendly and helpful and made everything go so smoothly! She took the time to offered suggestions that simplified my billing as a short term customer and they told me how to set up the app so as not to have to enter the entry/exit codes every time. Easy in and out, safe and clean.<//review><user>108180085259022008046</user><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>5<//Rate>< Date>

Julia and her team are great!
If you like a unit at this location and have questions then I would definitely encourage you to visit the location to clear all your doubts. They’re all super helpful and knowledgeable.

The units are modern and well maintained. Plus the building manager lives on-site which is awesome.

Thank you team :)< /text>

<Review>Great place to store items. I just moved out today after being here for 5 years (due to leaving the area). Highly recommend this location as it is clean and safe. The customer service is top notch. Hannah from the front office made the move out easy and even provided me with a broom and dust pan.

Wow. Mind blown. Life lived!
Where do I even begin when it comes to Tim? I’ve been hit with tough times when it comes to finding a helpful man. In these unprecedented times navigating storage units has become unbelievably complex. I needed a Tim.
Tim, you’re the man. You give public storage it’s legendary name. Are you single, asking for a friend? I will be back soon to store some objects. I want nothing else than to explore the endless hallways of this mighty fortress which is public storage with Tim by my side. Live laugh love Tim< /Review>

Tim gave us all the details that are needed! He is amazing! Also, the renting place looked clean and spacious.

I recently met the best customer service rep I have encountered at Public Storage. Tim was not only quick and knowledgeable, he made me feel like a VIP! I have been a customer at this PS for well over 5 years so that says a lot. You guys have more than a customer service rep, you have a human being that really does care about people.You are fortunate to have him<//Text>

<text>Tim was amazing. My mom Sheila McKell and I called in a panic on a Saturday with movers coming on Sunday. We realized our reserved space wasn’t going to be big enough. When we called the office, Tim helped us get the space reserved and made sure all the details were sorted. He came up to the locker with us to make sure all was good. I have to say - never have I experienced customer service like this, especially not at a storage place. Thank you Tim. Much appreciated.</text>< pics>

Review for 3033 Lafayette, Santa Clara, CA.
I cannot say enough pluses about this facility & most especially Tim as well as Shirley.  They were SO VERY HELPFUL & accommodating at a time when I was totally stressed out around moving...They could not have made the move any easier.   THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

Tim was super helpful and walked me around the building and showed me units since I have not rented before and didnt know what size unit I needed.
The next day I was trying to rent a unit on-line but couldn't navigate the site and so I called up the office.  Tim answered and patiently walked me through the steps to e-rent my space on-line.  Thanks a million Tim!</review>

Me and my husband rented from here at first we were very confused because we had never rented before but this one very respectful young lady helped us out I’m not sure what her name exactly was but I think it was fantasy or sum pretty like that I looked at her name tag and never seen a name like that but overall my experience here was great awesome customer service and very clean area.< /Text>

< Review>
I rented a storage unit at this property and I just have to let everybody know just how well the employees at this property treated me and how very very helpful they were to my needs and concerns. I was greeted by two very WELCOMING FRIENDLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, "☆SMILING "young ladies BY THE NAMES  NAYELY AND JUSTINA. They made me feel very   comfortable immediately and I knew from the moment I walked in that this was the right place for me to store my things and not have to worry. Any concern I had they were able to reassure me that I was making the right choice in choosing PUBLIC STORAGE.  And they  exceeded my expectations plus more with their expertise and kindness. Kindness goes a long way. Thank you ladies for all your help I look forward to seeing u again and again....

I have used this facility for over 10 years. I have found the staff ( Shirley and team ) to be very helpful and friendly overtime I have interacted with them. I have never had any problems and feel my stuff is very safe there. I like the hours I can get into my units because I need to be flexible in my business. The place is clean and hassle free. Could not ask much more from a storage place!</text>

Peter was very courteous, helpful, politely friendly! Having to come to a storage unit can be stressful and Peter actually made it a comfortable, pleasant experience! Many Mahalo’s Peter for your help! Aloha<//Text>

<text>Ana was extremely friendly and helpful! She made getting set up with a storage unit a breeze. Moving is a pain, especially when you're downsizing,  but Ana made getting set up with a storage unit was quick and easy. Thanks so much!<//text>< Pics>

<Text>I really enjoyed moving in and searching for this storage.  I’m a teacher so I have excess stuff for school which I rotate into my class.  Lydia was helpful, positive, and friendly.  It took only 30 minutes to get paperless move in and I like the unit she showed me.  You will enjoy a unit to help you organize your spaces in life.< /Text>< response>

<user_name>Luisa Pio</user_name><review>I rarely take the time to give reviews, especially because so many people have given this location really good ratings, but I had a really great experience with some of the staff. I was extremely stressed and felt helpless and Nayely, the property manager, was beyond helpful with helping me solve my issues. I walked in, quite frantic, because of a billing issue and a mishap which almost led to my unit being "taken" from me. I spoke to Nayely about the events that led to this point, she worked her magic, and all was well. She sensed my anxiety, or saw it, and proceeded to do everything she could to ensure my issue was solved and that it didn't occur again. She went above and beyond, for sure, I am super grateful.<//review>< resp>

<Review>Kolbie! She is a star! My dad recently passed away and there were some complications with trying to access his unit! I live a great distance from the facility so it would have been tough for me to come back. She didn’t know that, she just gave the best customer service without hesitation. I would be surprised if she is not a part of management. If I’m hiring, I’m coming for her! Can’t teach what she has. You either have it or don’t. And she got it! Kudos to Shirley for helping me at the end! That was a MAJOR help right there! So overwhelmed with how I was treated. Go team PS!</Review>< time>

<Review>Went to the Lafayette location last weekend, the representative Lydia was very friendly and helpful with our needs. She recommended various products onsite that may be useful, but was not pushy or aggressive in anyway. It was a pleasant experience dealing with her.<//Review>< rating>

<text>When I first walked in I was greeted by Kolbie she was friendly and super funny. She was able to answer any questions I had without any hesitation, she definitely knows what she’s talking about. I was also very pleased that the facility was clean which is a step up from all of the other storage facilities I looked at. Will definitely recommend this facility to friends and family.<//text>< Resp>

<text>This place is great. I went in looking at rentals to prepare for a move and a nice young lady names Colby helped me. He showed me some units and sold me some boxes and gave me some great info about rentals and space sizes. I look forward to going back and doing business at this public storage location.< /text>< pics>

The employees at this location were really pushy and tried to sell every upsell they could. I only needed a 5x5 unit but they kept asking what I was going to store in the unit. The only thing that was good about this location was that the facility was clean and up to date. They kept trying to sell me boxes. The mandatory insurance was a major turn off and the reason why I didn't rent from here.< /text>

I've had a great experience here so far. The staff is great and they are always willing to help you out. I love that the restroom is always clean and you don't have to enter with caution. The prices have gone up a few bucks in the last year but nothing too extreme. All things considered, this is a great place to keep your things.< /review>

I needed supplies for my move and decided to come in here and see what they had. One thing about me is that I love good customer service. Kolbie was so helpful in what I needed and even suggested some supplies I didn’t think I would need. Later when I was packing I was grateful for the suggestions she made. Kolbie was even nice enough to go over their current rates as I may need a storage space since I’m downsizing. Thank you for the awesome suggestions and excellent customer service! Maybe my move a lot less stressful.< /review>

This was our first experience renting storage and I can't thank the staff more for their stellar customer service.  This move has been an emotional and difficult one for us as we are downsizing significantly and leaving our home of 13-years.  Kolbie and (I hope I have his name correct - Steve?) went over and above to assist us with our needs, answer questions, and make us feel comfortable about leaving items that hold valuable memories for us in their facility.  We are very happy with the service and the facility in general.<//Text>

Steve was a pleasure to speak with to be introduced to the property. I have had rentals at other public storage facilities and I must say that this is certainly the best. It's very clean, the employees are warm and helpful. After I use this facility I will definitely be coming back here if I need another storage unit.</Text>

<Review>I have been renting  a space from this property    for a few months now and  I just have to put it out there that this property has one of the most helpful relief managers  by the name Justina. She is always smiling and happy whenever I just happen to stop by and go's well out of her way to make sure that I'm taken care of everytime and that really really makes me feel like I made the right choice of choosing to store my things at this property.  I would just like to thank her as well as the actual property manager Nayeli  whome also is very help full and soo nice . Thank you guys for making my storing experience a smooth pleasant un stressful time . 👍🤠👍</Review>< GmapID>

<review>The service was fantastic! I was assisted by 2 employees, women by the name of Kolbie and Sheila. I was afforded the opportunity to view several units to decide which was a good fit for my stuff. And packaging material is sold here as an extra convenience.<//review>< rating>

I walked in with my friend to get a storage and Nayely helped us out. She was very thorough and informative. Within 30 minutes we were in and out with storage and material to pack our stuff. I will be recommending this place.< /Review>

I've never had a storage unit before. The online reservation process made it easy, and they followed up quickly with a confirmation phone call. When I arrived to complete the sign-up in person, the staff was very helpful and cheerful. They explained the whole process very clearly and walked me around the facility.< /Text>

When I first entered the store the front desk employee by the name of Kolbie made me feel welcomed right from the start. All around nice facility and would recommend to anyone who’s looking for a safe storage.</Text>

<Review>Nalee and Kolby were phenomenal. I needed a storage I could drive right up to but they couldn’t accommodate me with none available.They could have just shrugged me off and let me be on my way but no. What did they do? They went above and beyond and found me multiple locations that COULD! I really appreciated them putting the leg work in for me. They saved me so much time and running around. They truly care for their would be customers and I bet their customers are treated like gold.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808fc980a08d7591:0xb8972729d76a9cc<//gmap_id></record>

When I first walked in I was greeted by kolbie . she was very knowledgeable and helpful (considering all the many questions I had) with their different units, cost etc. Over all I had a great expeirence, other storages places I have dealt with had employees who were not so thrilled to help. Very refreshing to have someone so happy and willing!<//review>

All the employees here are SO WONDERFUL and HELPFUL. Everytime I come here, I need help or have questions and each of them knows how to answer or at least solves my problems. I had to move from a large space to a smaller place. It was so easy and quick. The only thing I had a problem was being charged a fee from storage to storage. Figured being a member I wouldn't, but I guess that's policy.. Other than that, place is kept clean. Very prompt on cleaning any mess. Very satisfied.  High five to this crew. Keep up the great Work.< /Text>

This is my first time EVER to rent a storage unit(s)...Yes one wasn't enough! And the staff was sooo refreshingly nice, professional and eager to assist all your needs!..Particularly Colbert and Steve, I'm sure all 3033 PS Staff share the same zest but the two I mentioned seemed to take me by the hand...< /text>

BEST EXPERIENCE EVER! I had the pleasure working with Alma and Jediah. If I could hire these two I would. They were kind, friendly, took the time to explain what they had available as well as took me on tours. I rented with them with in 24 hours. I am so thankful that this process was so easy. My unit is in a perfect location and the service team is very dependable. Win win for all. The price is what it is in this area and honestly it is not bad at all if you compare it to the average rent for a one bedroom in SV. IF you need a place to store your property, this place feels like home.< /text>

I went in here not knowing whats the process was looking for a unit and Kolbie/Nayely - Super friendly and very approachable. I went to get a quote and they were very helpful. They didn't make me feel pressured into locking into anything, but they definitely made me feel welcomed to come back since I am a first time storage user. Will be using their services in the near future, I definitely recommend this place.< /text>

I just rented a storage unit a few days ago so I can't speak about long term experiences with this facility, but I can rave about the amazing customer service I have experienced so far. Kolbie was friendly, knowledgeable and very efficient at time of renting. She answered most questions before I even asked them, offered recommendations and made me feel comfortable in renting a storage unit at this location. After pricing at a nearby competitor who offered lower rates, but indicated they have had 13 break-ins in the 2 months they have been open (EEEK!), this location of Public Storage has what appears to be better security and motion detectors on the premises for after hours that contact police. Price is competitive, facility is clean, they offer online accounts/bill pay and I definitely recommend this facility for storage needs. Thank you Kolbie for all of your help! You rock!</Text>

I'll give 5 stars to this Public Storage facility. The office stuff (Nayely, Cathy and Suvie) are very friendly and professional. I've been renting three different sizes of storage units since last May 2013, and every time I upgraded my storage unit, they've been very helpful and patience. Before I found this storage place, I searched for the best rates, and believe me their rates are very reasonable. Also this facility is very safe and clean, and thank you for providing us with a good customer service.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I was greeted pleasantly and treated courtiously, as I have been on every visit to the rental office.  I was asked if I'd like to make payments via PS automatic debit program. I said, "not at this time" and Julia was accepting and pleasantly said,  "Maybe in the future you might want to consider this way of paying to prevent possible late fees." I agreed and advised her that I once managed a self storage co.
What impressed me the most was when my payment was initially declined by my credit union; it had slipped my mind from the night before that my wife was paying bills. I ofered to pay cash for a portion and asked to debit the rest to my checking. Payment was completed with ease and quickness, as if I had planned it that way.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<date>1392244740501< /date><Rate>5</Rate><Text>I just move back to Bay Area from Montana decide to use the same stores, which is now brought by public storage. I call they got me in and the staff was especially helpful. My first problem was that the storage that I reserve was not big enough, so Ms Nayely help me that same day find me a much bigger storage which was to big, because that was the only one that they had at that time. So Mr Robert put me down on a wait list for a 10 x 10 two weeks later I move in!!! This staff reminds me of my old job always look out for the customers. Great job Nayely, Tiana, Robert and Julia. Keep up the good work!

Thanks

I took my friend to get her a storage unit and helped her move her things into it.  The staff in the front office were very helpful and friendly, especially the Suvie.  She explained everything to the both of us in detail and always had a smile on her face.  The price online was better than the price given to you in the office so remember that and the unit was perfect.  The only negative thing is there are NO PETS allowed on the premise and the other Public Storages in the same area do allow PETS.  That sucks cuz if my friend wants to go to her storage, since I am her ride everywhere, I'm gonna have to make other arrangements for my dog, BeBe and she goes EVERYWHERE with me...even to work!  Other than that, I like the location, price and staff at this Public Storage.< /Text>

Somebody broken my Key and taken all the staff(all the documents,Brief case,Bed frame etc) from this Public storage.
The worker are not helping to findout the person. They are  not helping at all.
Even Management is telling they are not resposable. Insurance also not resposable for this matter.

Please please avoid this public storage.<//review>

<text>This is the worst maaco location! A 3-4 day job turned into 3 weeks!! And now what they have done is worse than when we originally started. I have been trying to reach management for weeks but every time I’m told they aren’t available or on the phone. I’ve sent emails, complaints to corporate and nothing! It would be nice to actually speak to someone who knows what’s going on instead of being told to call back or they will pass a message along. It looks like the owner responds to these comments so ALI if your reading this please return our calls/ emails!! Here are a few pics showing the work they have done so far. I do not recommend anyone doing business with this location.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfSoQUF33s4I42zv0LPct5zoHT7j6T5wze60Wb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAwDGwnffPK86CvXvRky1W8b8D-YcKu9PE8jxm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEfX3CUwcwHPGLDIu6sPOoxrcCYDIkgmum-88s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYf4x9gdqdyPoAbnzE3cgXcrUJR1CJQtXvR1aT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQhmiAlCpY3IH61y810dMhVB0gac54S1330OhL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

They do good work if you are on a budget but you do get what you pay for. As the cheapest they also leave a bit to be desired. Small imperfections and more then anything small oversprays are common and did occur on my car. However I am happy with the work they did.

Ultimately if you are looking for an immaculate paint job this is not your stop but if you want something that looks presentable or just some repairs for the lowest price. Maaco is a good option.

I can recommend if you have a daily you just want to look nice.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
They were great. Honest and upfront. Heard something like "we are the Walmart of car paint"...so I got a great deal and they still did a good job.

My dad wasnt impressed but dads are never impressed, right? That's what they're for.

I chose the middle priced package and it looks absolutely wonderful.< /Review>

I was promised that it will take 1 week to 1 1/2 weeks to get my car completely done & it took the shop exactly 8 weeks! I was informed that one of their employees ended up getting Covid. Therefore, there was a one to two weeks delay which I was okay with that. The shop also called me 4 times informing me that my car is ready to be picked up. One of the calls was when I came to the shop to pick it up, it just came out of the painting booth and they didn’t even put any of the parts back on it yet. Another time I came out, they forgot to install the right rear wheel arch liner and the rear view mirror had fallen off for some reason. Another time I was told my car was ready to be picked up, there was black glue in several spots of the car. I had also requested to have them remove several parts before they do any body work or painting which I had it in writing and they NEVER removed it! This will now cause the paint to chip in the near future. The car is still not completely done! But, I couldn’t wait any longer without using another car for my transportation. I told the general manager that I will be back to the shop to have them finish their work. But, I don’t know how long it will take them to completely finish the job because they tend to overbook their appointments. There are still overspray in certain areas of the car, bondo work was not finished on the hood and around the grill. The windshield sprayers on the hood needs to be removed, sanded and repainted. Certain areas of the car have bumps and are rough. I bought and installed several new parts after I picked up the car and I’m just worried that they might just make things worst for me if I bring it back to have them work on it again and might get some overspray on other areas of the car. They did an ok job on most of the body work and I thought the paint job was okay too until I found out some areas still needs touched up, sanding, buffing and removal of some overspray. This place is under new owner/management and I do not recommend bringing your car at this shop in Vallejo.</text>< Pictures>

I must warn everyone that this shop is gonna rip you off and on top of that will do damage on your vehicle and won’t own up to it, Rosie and Amal is the most dishonest people I have ever dealt with, inexperience workers, prep work is very poor, the paint start bubbling after one week, pointed out to Rosie and she said that I signed to waive full paint removal , but before that , she said it should be fine  as long as they sand it with peeling paint, she basically lied and tricked me on signing the paper work, I asked her who would pay almost a thousand dollars and will say it’s ok if the paint bubbles,on top of that my driver side window is mis alligned, they cut the wires that unlock my camper window in the back, left the rubber seal hanging from the camper shell, overspray all over the truck and she tells me that is normal coz I only paid almost a thousand dollars , she kept saying she was gonna fix all the things they ruin , but every time I go there  ,  she keeps telling me the worker is sick or she will make up something that she told me to come on a certain time , she and Amal can not be trusted, if you guys still go there , don’t say I didn’t warn you ..,</Text>

I had a very positive experience here in late August 2020.  I needed some body repair done and a complete paint job and they handled it at a much lower cost than the other 4 locations I got quotes from.  The repair looks clean and the paint job was also very clean.
They also communicated with me well on time, and made the effort to the get the car ready before Labor Day weekend so that I didn't have to wait 3 days until the following week.  Professional and helpful overall and I would recommend.<//review>

Really happy with the job they did.  Amal was very helpful and professional.  I went to Richmond Maaco and they wanted to charge me more than double the price!
I just wanted some cosmetic work on my car before the miles run too high and I have to change cars, so the work and the price I paid were perfect for my situation.  I will be giving my future business to this wonderfully run Maaco!!  Please don’t hesitate to give them a chance.  The job was also done in the time allotted and I was not charged more than the estimate given to me.  Good work Vallejo Maaco!!< /Text>

<Text>My Dad's caddie was looking so unhappy after he had a run in with a semi-truck,  but once Maaco got through with it...you never would know it had lost the battle!!! Great job on the  bodywork and paint job. Fantastic customer service by Rosie and crew. Price was great. I highly recommend them!

<text>Brought a Mustang Spoiler here to be painted. Paid $290 for just a paint job and clean up. Job was supposed to take 2 days not 2 weeks. After 1 week I got a call to pick it up. The spoiler was half painted and they didn’t clean it up which I had paid extra for. Amal was extremely rude and unprofessional to me. He had to phone his wife several times and proceeded to yell at her and hang up on her. Very unprofessional. After 2 weeks I can finally pick up my spoiler. Over spray all over the hardware and they didn’t clean it up very well before repainting a 2nd time. If you need a paint job it would better to go elsewhere. Don’t bother with Maaco unless you don’t mind bad unprofessional service or you don’t mind shoddy work.

Edit: Sent info to Maaco. Still have not heard back.</text><userid>111621894351412240825</userid>< gmap_id>

Overall I am happy but I had to paint areas they missed and refused to paint under the front lights which is mysterious to me. They also didn’t charge any extra for the overspray under my car but informed me that I could “do some homework and take care of it with a little flat black paint. They also took the time to show me how to touch up the overspray around the moldings, many thanks for this training. Lastly, when I returned it to fix an obvious workmanship defect they tried to blame it on a previous non-existent scratch, again very mysterious!! All in all, since I am capable of cleaning behind them and have strong negotiating ability, I am happy with them. My advice is that you understand your expectations up front.</Text>

Great price and top quality work...  I have painted 4 cars there this year and I could not be more satisfied.  Rosie and Amal run a clean hassle free business and a friendly environment.  Best deal around town and anywhere else in thebay area.   I was qouted 4k by their competitor, Maaco finished the bodywork, paint and sealer for under $900.00.  I recommend this shop for anybody wanting excellent quality work for the best price!<//Text>

Vallejo Maaco has been in business less than 1 year but you wouldn't know it. With monthly paint promo deals and professional & knowledgeable staff this is the place for auto body repair at reasonable prices.<//Review>

<text>MAACO has been great for me.  From the techs to Rosy, the office manager, they have been attentive to my needs.  Rosy keeps the very busy office running, juggling phones, customers, and orders with aplomb and a smile.  She is absolutely unflappable.  They finished my car in record time, did a great job and smoothed over insurance woes after I was rear ended by an uninsured driver.  Hats off to MAACO and Rosy and Amal.  MAACO ROCKS!!< /text>< GmapID>

<Review>Did not like the way they over sprayed my engine and other places, they did not want to fix their mistakes after i pointed out that they didnt spay some lower parts of my car, i had to pay extra for a few minor things they messed up on and they didnt want to take resposibility, i dont reccomend anyone going there and if you do make sure whatever they tell you its on paper. When i went to pick up my car they tryed to avoid me, didnt ask if i like the work or if i had any questions or issues, poor customer service.<//Review>< Pics>

This was excellent. Super nice people at the counter and the food is excellent excellent excellent don't forget to ask for the gravy. The coleslaw was really good also. They also sell pastries. I most definitely will come back. If you come in a car park in the back.</text>

A "hidden gem" of East Sac. Multiple flavors available both ready-to-eat or bake-at-home. Consistently good quality ingredients and a crust that you will want to eat every last bit of. All topped off with a unfailingly friendly staff.< /Review>

<review>Cornish pasties originate from Cornwall in England, my homeland they are not from here in the USA. I lived in NV 8 years the gold state never saw one. These pasties are not 100 % the same, but they come in very close. I do agree with the person who says the meats abit big and chewy. I have searched out British foods as I miss them. I would recommend this pasties shack, been there many times now and about to go again in a few days. It only sells pasties with a couple of sides. I give it 93% nearing the real pastie. Love it. Wish they did more British foods.</review>< pics>

I went there today after searching for a place that serves savory pies and or bakes in Sacramento. I got three pasties and gravy to go. Omg... they are absolutely scrumptious. My favorite was the Bavarian. The have good amounts of filling. If you are a fan of savory stuff this is the place to go. The man in the counter was also very polite. There is parking in the back.</Text>

<Text>Not an authentic Cornish pasty. It's good, don't get me wrong. We tested the Cornish pasties. Now, I grew up in the gold country and grew up eating Cornish pasties, I know how they should be. They should be able to be hand held. These were too big for that. The meat should be bite size and tender. The meat chunks were too big and slightly too tough to chew easily. I'd go back again but only because Marshall's Pasties in Grass Valley is an hour away and Pasty Shack is convenient.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x809ada78bb78f449:0x39eded1612fe96b5<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<review>I don’t believe the other reviews here!  I made the mistake and bought half a dozen one day when I happened to drive by.
I grew up eating pasties in Australia and UK and these concoctions are totally unrecognizable!
In fact they’re downright inedible.
And gravy!? Must be an American thing. No way was gravy a part of eating pasties. It’s an insult to the Cornish coal miners who lived off pasties in the deep dark mines. They never packed gravy with their pasties! This shop is a total invention and inauthentic. You might agree with me if you’ve ever tasted a real pastie. These are really terrible.
They can’t even get their spelling right! It’s “pastie” not “pasty”.</review>< username>

First discovered them via a local bar that buys their pasties here for their menu (this bar takes them to a yummy level). I have since gone into Pasty Shack several times and tried different flavors. Love their homemade taste - anytime I am craving a warm pot roast dinner, I stop in here and pick up a couple Cornish pasties for me and my love. Best way to eat them?

Accessible to a wheelchair with help with the door. Small area but quaint. Limited selections but the owner offered me a free apple pasty because it was burnt on the underside. It was was quite tasty considering. I love the fact they offer Chile Verde . Will be back. Cost is under $8 each.<//Review>

I had never been here about a week ago, and once I tryed it I fell in love ! Litterally lol. Iv been twice now and I live in Modesto, So worth it !! The outer is soft and crisp with so much flavor inside the pasty. Nice bit of history about the food and the store to learn while your there too. We will be stopping every time were in the area now.<//text>

They offer a few different types of pasty, Beef, onions and potatoes or chicken with vegetables are two of the five types.  Each pasty is huge and delicious. They are sold precooked, or bake at home.< /text>

For what this place is, it's perfect. It's not fine dining by any stretch. The inside of the place is small, holding only four small tables. The pasties are amazing! The crust is unbelievably light and flakey. The filling is steamy and flavorful. I had a Bavarian pasty, which has ground beef, cabbage, and bell pepper. My companion had a vegan pasty, all vegetable filling. Whatever spices they use made both taste great. We each got the optional gravy, which is vegan. It's a British brand called Bisto. We also got a side of coleslaw, which was good (Solomon's Deli in Davis has the best coleslaw I've ever had, and this wasn't quite that good), and canned soda, Pellegrino. The service is extremely fast. You can grab a pasty and go for a quick meal. We decided to eat there, and were the only customers from about 12:30 - 1:00 on a Saturday. I sure hope they do more business on weekdays. Go if you can, because it would be a shame if a place this great went out if business!< /review>

Delighted to find Cornish Pasties in Sac. I'm a Brit who grew up eating pasties from all over. I've also made them from scratch following old recipes.  I'm a total pasty head I've just got 2 for now to try,  1 reg and 1 chicken.. I'll be back in a couple days when I've tried them to give a review.  The fact that the Pasty Shack has been operating for 70 years, starting off in a shop in an alley downtown is good enough for me, doing something right. Can't wait to try them, will let u know. 😁<//Review>

<Review>We have been eating the Pastys here for years and love them. I often had the Chicken and they were good BUT tonight It was Excellent  The meat seemed fresher and I loved the new variety of vegetables ,Green Beans,Carrots & Squash and others….I think this my new 1st Choice, My husband had the Mexican said it was new also and Excellent so whoever is making them now has changed the recipes for the better…..</Review>< response>

What could be easier to eat on the fun than a Cornish pasty?  Tiny Pasty Shack offers several varieties of these nourishing savory turnovers.  Try the Bavarian, filled with ground beed, chopped cabbage, bell peppers, and onions, or the frisky Chile Verde (available Fridays only).  There's also a veggie version!<//Review>

The price is high but the coffee is really good. Far better than Aromas which is also expensive but they do not use Kona. The atmosphere is nice and so are the people that work there. They also sell magnets.< /text>

Good selection of drinks... my husband got a specialty coffee & I got an Italian cream soda. Wish they had my fav syrups: peach🍑,  mango 🥭, or coconut🥥 but those were out.  Love a coconut lime or peaches& cream Italian soda. Nice selection of beans there. Quick service.</review>

< Review>
I was there today I gave Stony Point location a 2nd chance. When I order the Hawaiian Coffee. I’m told it’s expensive coffee. Do I look I can’t afford $6 coffee?, what’s the point of me ordering what I want if I’m told is expensive. If they are trying to sale the product “Coffee” they are not doing a great job. Both times different people I’m told the same thing. 🙄< /Review>

Used to always order from Peets or Starbuck but this coffee spot is tasty! Little things such as putting coffee ice cubes instead of normal ice cubes is what won me over!</text>

< review>
Friendly staff and good coffee, from what I could drink, and that's about it. They were out of dark roast and brewed a new batch and it tasted good till I got to about 1/3 of a cup and got a lot of grouds and couldn't drink anymore. Poured it out and found the bottom almost completely filled with those grounds. This is what filters were made for. That's my only complaint, but it's a pain when you're still finding grounds in your mouth hours later.<//review>

Ordered 2 iced coffees, one with almond milk & one with hemp milk.  Nice that they had alternative milk choices.  (They also had soy).  They were very good.  Prices a little more than a Starbucks.  Good atmosphere.<//Review>

However, they forgot to give my boyfriend his drip coffee after he paid for it. Also, I should have asked how my $9 breakfast burrito was prepared. It turned out to be a small microwaved burrito that was burnt and stuck to the paper. Despite my disappointment, my boyfriend graciously ate it for me so I didn't bother complaining to the employees about it.</Review><pics>None< /pics></record>

<review>These people are FANTASTIC! They used to do a "bad" joke of the day, but it's fallen off recently. My coworkers and I go all the time. At least several times a week. It's closer, easier, and tastier than Starbucks. One of my coworkers goes there so often that they start making her drink when she walks in! Talk about service. And they're always super friendly (we usually go before noon). I got one of their reusable cups for hot drinks, but they also let me use it for their blended coffees as well.

Favourite drinks in our office:
* Bad Ass Mocha Blended add shot
* Toffee Bar blended, sub white chocolate for dark, add caramel
* Caramel Wave blended
* Haole's Menehune hot, extra raspberry<//review>< pics>

This review is after only 1 visit. Great staff however our espresso drinks were not good. We've had much better experiences with their other location in northern Santa Rosa.< /Review>

Expensive ice tea with mainly ice, barely any liquid. I baughb two breakfast burritos and they almost totalled up to $20, tasted like powdered eggs, cheap cheese and I never tasted the sausage it supposedly had. Rip off.<//text>

I have always had a good experience with them (thanks Daniel), and today was no exception. I needed a tow, and Daniel had told me it would be a couple of hours at least before they could get there. I really appreciated his honesty and could work with that, so he had the driver call me when he was on his way to my vehicle. Ian called me when he was on the way, so everything worked out great. Ian is very courteous and professional, and was actually my driver the last time I needed a tow. I recommend Blue Sky Towing very highly to everyone needing a tow or lock out services!!<//text>

< Review>
Was referred by AAA. Lost the keys to my van, battery dead and stuck in a carport.
Called Blue Sky Towing and explained my situation. Got a cost at $100. Told to wait for a hour. Hour passed. I called. The lady at the other end of the phone said there was no history of me calling (trying to make an excuse of their poor service).

I ask again for services. Told them again, lost keys, dead battery and stuck in a carport.
Was told 45 min wait. $150. NO problem. The tow guy comes... He says. Nah, its going to be at least $180. Didn't know it was parked in a carport... Blah blah blah! So I hurry and pay him. He comes back to me and tells me that I have to hurry and drive to my destination because the police needed him for a tow.

I will NEVER DO SERVICES WITH THIS COMPANY AGAIN! RUDE AND THE PRICES KEPT CHANGING. I DIDN'T MIND THAT, IT WAS JUST THE GAME OF WAITING AND WASTING MY TIME.< /Review>

<Review>The the tow crew were very helpful when I was in a place of need. They even gave me recommendations for local autoservices. They crew was friendly and encouraging.

It did take a while for the pick up to arrive due to my remote pickup and the early hours when my case first occured.

Thank you Blue Sky Towing for bei g good people.</Review>< Pics>

Would definitely recommend! Needing a tow is never fun, but Jason with Blue Sky made the whole experience so much less stressful. He was pleasant and professional and, unlike other tow companies, actually on time! Tbis is HUGE!! I was so stressed for time, but he showed up and made quick work of the job.  He anaged to turn my mood around and even got me to laugh. I hope to never need another tow, but if I ever do, Blue Sky Towing will be my first call!</text>

Blue sky towing should not be associated with AAA, they tried charging me $50 for an extra mile! This shows that blue sky towing is trying to practice unethical and unlawful services for profit. The driver showed up took and pictures of license and license plate.(shady) Tow services never have done that! Then the guy doesn’t say a word till it’s money time. 50$! “I’m covered for 5 miles and we are going 4.5 miles”. I told him to look up the address and he told me this happened before and you can take the tow or not. I explained that I could understand a mile even two at cost. I told him that I was not paying that amount. Instead of making a call and trying to figure it out he just said tow canceled. 20 min later got another tow at no charge! Dan the manager called and texted me and tried to apologize and make excuses with no resolution, he ended the conversation by saying “I have nothing else to say”. I'm very disappointed that AAA would affiliate with such a company. I gave blue sky towing one star because it doesn’t let you put zero stars.</review>

So i never used the towing part of the company. Maybe i will after what i witnessed. I was pulling up to a stop sign today and saw one of you drivers out of the truck helping someone push there truck off the road. It was a good deed and i give you 5 stars for employing good moral people</text>

<review>Polite call center, cheapest for me in the Clovis area. Everyone else was higher prices and I just happened to call them on a whim. So happy I did, came out with a flatbed, picked up my vehicle and straight to the shop. As I've mentioned the call center guy was very polite and the tow driver was as well. Will always come back and will also reference to those in need of towing!</review>< user_name>

Your truck ending in 3D2 was swerving all over the place today at 6pm. The driver was distracted, using a phone or tablet while merging from 180 to 99, not watching the road. Overcorrected several times almost hitting cars to the left and cones on the right. Scary stuff.<//review>

Very friendly, prompt service. Made sure I was safe inside the tow truck (my car over heated on the freeway) & got us home safely, in less time than expected. HIGHLY recommended.</Text>

Based on 3 times having had a vehicle essentially stolen out from under me, by Fresno PD or Clovis PD, and held for $$ransom$$ (impound)...Brandon and Jen run the best, most customer friendly towing business in the Fresno/Clovis area! Their driver(s) are absolutely awesome! Thank you MM!!< /review>

By far the best towing service in town. Also I've bought a half a dozen cars from them in the last 5 years. All were great cars once I put a few bucks into them. I love their layaway program. Only towing company in town that offers that. Great way to help people who can't afford to buy a car right off. Thank you Blue Sky Towing. You are AWESOME!<//text>

<review>I had a flat tire on 99 just before the Ashlan exit. My ins company called blue sky to come out and they towed my car to my house. I was given a 6hr window!!!!! When I called blue sky to make sure that time frame was correct the woman laughed and said someone would be there within an hour. It was MAYBE 20mins later that my car was being loaded. I can’t express how much I appreciate the help and their ability to relax me with laughter. They are absolutely #1 on my list if I need help in the future!!!<//review>< pics>

Fast and friendly service. Very clean and professional with your vehicles.
And if you're looking for a decent ride at a fare price, they usually have a great selection to choose from.< /review>

The car's they sell only work for a short amount of time then break down after a month or so and i'm not the only one who this has happened to. They don't issue refunds or anything either. To be fair I should've known better.< /text>

These guys are thieves.  I had a car on layaway - no one said I had to make a payment every month (I thought I could simply pay what I could) and missed a month.  They put my car back out for sale.  I had paid $800 of $3000.  So I said I had the balance and asked if they would meet me to take final payment and give me the car.  They said, "No, we don't work on the weekend" (but I work all week).  I was so disgusted that I didn't want to go back.  Be warned.  These guys are scam artists.  They would do a tow on the weekend but wont come in for $2200?  That is because they wanted to keep the car and my $800.  Repulsive. Disgusting.<//text>

<Review>Where on table turned to 3 w a large party of new made friends. We were all table hopping and being the life of the bar and everyone was just happy, hangin and having a good time like the good ol days. Security and bartender were helpful and in good spirits too! Maybe we just got lucky this night, but I’m down to return w my friends again<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<review>It is not possible that the security man of this place was very drunk last night. He told me that his name is Tod. You can not put a drunk man to take care of our safety in this bar. please put more attention on your security employees.<//review><date>1555796733956< /date>< Pictures>

Fun spot. It was a big quiet on labor day weekend, but the pool table was amazing. Only $0.75! Can't beat it. The drinks were good also - the bartender was quick and courteous since it was just our party pretty much.

The one thing I wish they would change is the juke box. There were awkward silences between songs, which made me wonder if I should just pay to get a song going. The silence definitely creates a lull in the momentum of the party. Regardless, we had a great time before leaving.< /review>

<Text>I gave this salon less stars before I updated it since the stylist happily let me come back to finish my hair. She did a really good job I think honestly they all get overbooked there.i was going to give one less star because of the interaction when I showed up with the owner when  she tried to make it seem like it was my fault but it worked out in the end satisfactory (?) (I’m pretty sure she was)< /Text>< pics>

Tiffany remedied a really bad cut that I had gotten at a different salon. I have textured hair that needs layered with precision to lay properly and evenly. Even though I showed up late after work and she had another client after me, she still did a fantastic job. I love it! She's wonderful for thick/textured hair.< /Text>

I have been going to Salon Vivace for years and I love it there.  The salon is elegant and provides great services.  Denise styles my hair and does an excellent job.  I have been completely satisfied with her and with the rest of the staff.  They are friendly and helpful.  I feel comfortable and cared for when I go.<//Review>

I found this salon quite shabby.  My haircut looks horrible!  After I washed it at home, the hair looks chopped and one side is longer than the other!  I now need to find someone else to correct it.  I cannot believe all the positive reviews here.< /Review>

I have recently shifted here and was looking for a salon nearby and I finally found one.

I needed a haircut since a year and was sceptical to try any new salon but these guys amazed me with their skills.

The salon is really pretty from outside and the staff inside adds life to it.Once you enter the salon you will be greeted with a warm smile and she will offer you something to drink.

I had my appointment with Celine and the moment I entered I found her right there on time.She was very warm, courteous, knowledgeble  and skilled.

I told her what kind of haircut I was looking for and she delivered much more.During the session she gave me advice about my hair care and we bonded just like friends.

These guys are skilled and they know exactly what the customer is looking for. There will be many who know what the customer is looking for and few who can exceed the expectations.They are one of those.

What I noticed was a staff who was cheerful, courteous and it seemed they loved their job.

A happy place like this will definitely make their customer happy. Value for money 10/10< /Text>

<Review>This 100 year-old historic home looks as inviting from the outside as you are treated when inside!  Everyone is friendly and the the way they have the shop set up makes you feel like you've stepped into a swanky place that only a star would experience!

Passing through the white picket fence and making your walk up the covered porch gives you a feeling of an era long gone. The porch swing is inviting and to see the ladies who work there sitting in it and chatting between customers gives it a home feeling.

I've been going to Connie for years and followed her from her previous shop and love the new atmosphere that she is in.  I have never left disappointed and her sunny personality is a huge plus.  I trust no one with my hair and having her cut and style in this Victorian home makes me feel even more glamorous when I leave.<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

Atmosphere was awesome and I love the cut and the products they use. Kevin Murphy smells amazing and the samples I got *actually* add volume to my hair (I got the plumping wash and rinse). Going back for my next cut and possibly trying some color! They've absolutely earned my trust, yay Vivace!< /Text>< gmap_id>

<review>I love this salon! Beautiful inside, excellent  service, I was pleasantly surprised that the services are priced competitively. Given the location in downtown Pleasanton, I had thought maybe it would be expensive and snooty, but it isn't  that way at all!
They also feature cosmetics, jewelry and other fun stuff, and the hair care products they use and offer for sale are really good.
The staff  are all pleasant and courteous.I get highlights there and I've been happy with my hair every visit. I like the website and online appointment scheduling. I highly recommend this salon!</review>< Pictures>

<Text>What a pleasant break from the norm. This salon is in an historic house in Pleasanton and whomever decorated with a fantastic job.
My stylist was Katie Tavres - what a wonderful young lady. At first, she had a barrage of questions and it seemed odd but, after a while I got it. She wanted to know how I wear my hair so she could do the cut around my bad habits.
So, another bad habit I have is cutting my own hair. When I am at my desk and, if my bangs won't stay out of my eyes, I go a cut my bangs. I'm a technical writer and not a stylist so you can imagine what they looked like. But, she worked around my styling snafu and fixed it all up.
I greatly recommend Katie for her styling and coloring expertise. And, let's not forget how important conversation is when you're at a salon for hours. Although Katie is young, (and I am not) she was able to keep me engaged with some pretty interesting conversation.
Thanks Katie – I’ll be back.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

For years I have been searching for a stylist for years that really comprehends the texture of your hair all the way to your personal style and even your daily regimens/routines. Now I have found the place where hair dreams come true.
Every single time I came in to get a cut Rachel NAILED IT above and beyond my expectations. Every single time I came to get my hair done for a special event she made my hair look far better than any pin on Pinterest.
Also another amazing part about this salon is that their product knowledge and product placement is the best of the best. They use all natural/organic/paraben free products which made a huge difference in the health of my hair.

I can full heartedly say that I will never place my hair in the hands of any other salon because the team here just gets it. They are on trend, knowledgeable, and perfectionists. Search no more ladies and gentleman because Salon Vivace is where it is at.</Review>< pictures>

I made a large order for an office party. I ordered it 24 hours in advance. The customer service was great. She gave good advice for combining the bagel flavors with the sandwiches and spreads. The workers had the order ready on time. The bagels and ingredients were fresh. It was very reasonably priced. I will come back here again whenever I am responsible for picking up an office order for food.  My coworkers were very happy with the selection I brought. They had good things to say about the food.  No complaints.< /review>

This is a must try if you love bagels and cream cheese. Very fresh Bagels and Cream cheese. So far I've tried their plain and everything bagel 🥯, and veggie and Jalapeno cream cheese. I love it!  It's one of the best in the west coast that I've tried. Thank you very much guys!</text>

These bagels are the real deal. They’re just delicious. The other places with “bagel” in their names are usually just round bread with a hole in it. Quick service too.<//Text>

1st time try ('19/10). Very impressed. Small shop, but lots of good help, tons of bagel-sandwich-drink-coffee choices (see pix posted)!

Indoor/outdoor limited, handicap accessible seating (with one wooden high chair available). Two unisex bathroom, and handicap parking direct in front of entrance.<//Text>

Decided to give bagel posh a chance today after seeing in many times. Oh boy am i glad i did! Walked in and it was very clean and organized. The ladies working the counter were very nice and helpful. For a very basic idea the options are endless no matter what you get it will be amazing. Even the coffee was fantastic! New favorite breakfast spot</review>

The staff work real well together in serving the public with their large array of bagels and other items.  The bagel sandwiches are so good.  My daughter works there and enjoys it.  The atmosphere is fine.  More tables and chairs is needed and I would like this business to be expanded because of the huge amount of customers.  You know they are doing things  right!< /review>

A nice mom and pop shop with a large variety of food and drinks beyond just bagels. The only downside is the service is extremely slow. I fully recommend it if you are in no hurry.</text>

<Text>Breakfast Bagel is one of THE Best around Sacramento.  Apple Turnover is hands down #1. Cannot go wrong. Also, found out today they make natural Fruit Smoothies.  What! It was a great Friday that started off at Posh Bagel.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x809ae486d584d9dd:0x31ae156b8c713c67</Gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate><Date>1549063184569<//Date></record>

Fresh ingredients. Great texture to the bagels, especially when toasted. My favorite is the pesto bagel with turkey. There is a nice firm crunch to the crust. Always pleased with the product. The little side potato salad is great too. You can also get your boba fix here!< /text>

The only plus I see, is it is located in Folsom. The bagels are not very good, and they are over-priced. I ordered a dozen bagels, and was disappointed that it was 12 instead of the traditional 13 for a baker's dozen. While paying, the cashier must have been new (which is ok, we all learn when doing a new job) because she got scolded by an angry woman for not charging enough. Evidently having a cranberry bagel means it is "gourmet" and therefore needs a higher price. I was told the new amount was $18.47. I said there is no way I was paying that for a dozen bagels. The angry woman again scolded this young worker who was getting frustrated. I felt bad for her. A third worker came to help her out. The new total was $16 and some change. Still way too much money for twelve bagels. All because I did not want to drive an extra 15 minutes (each way) to go to Noah's on Hazel. I figured the bagels would still be good. I get home and we start to eat them. The first raisin bagel tastes like garlic and onion and is covered in sesame seeds. I am fine with the seeds but not a big fan of garlic and, for me, onions taste terrible. Back to the "gourmet" cranberry bagel...while it had a nice taste, the bagels was much smaller than the other flavors I got.  Even the texture of the all the bagels is off. They are very dense, not light and chewy like nearly every other bagel place. Bottom line, they are expensive and poor quality. Sacramento is not known for having good bagels anyway, so if you are looking for something reasonable, go with Noah's. Posh bagel is just a complete disappointment.< /review>

<text>The sandwich bagels were yummy stuff but they forgot my potato salad and spread copious amounts of cream cheese onto the bagels, which I guess is fine if you like that, but you couldn't taste the bagel.< /text><time>1559540535793< /time><UserId.>112049316238585385053< /UserId.>< name>

Friendly Service, Great Bagels, Amazing Sandwiches, Good Coffee & Fantastic Pastries!

The owners and staff are very friendly and efficient. They have a large selection of delicious Breakfast and Lunch Sandwiches. Their Bagel & Lox Sandwich is the best I've had. Their breakfast sandwiches will make you never want to look at fast-food breakfast again. They also make their own fresh Pastries, Danishes & Cupcakes. Their hand decorated Cupcakes are impressive. Can't say enough about this hidden treasure.</review>

Very good selection of bagels and muffins and quick service although due to its popularity the line will go out the door on weekend mornings despite there being 3-4 people taking orders. If I could I would also like to take a star away from the person ahead of me who took all of the Pesto bagels:) jk</review>

Pretty good... didn't blow me out of the water for menu was pretty broad. This allowed too many options for me to be able to make a good choice I'd say. Eggwich and honey macchiato was alright, but my assumption thought it would be the best choice. Getting a lot of choices but nothing seems to be perfected. I personally like less options but premium quality in ingredients and presentation. My brother in law and sister enjoyed their experience for apparently the "pizza bagel" is a great option there. I'd say if you'd want to experiment or test run one of the nearly 100 options TEST IT OUT!< /Review>

Have had wonderful bagels in the past but today they burnt all the bagels that I ordered. The staff hesitated to even put the cream cheese on them! Her boss, nodded to have her complete the order even though they both knew the bagels were burnt! I was so shocked when I unwrapped them and discovered just how burnt they were. When I called to share my experience, they just said "thank you for sharing". Really!!! I spent almost $10 for burnt bagels!!< /Text>

I'm new to the Sacramento area and was sightseeing with the family. In Fulsom, Posh Bagels came highly recommended! The sandwiches we ordered were HUGE with all the fixins! Great toasted taste on the bagels. The lox, capers, cucumber, tomato,etc slices were very fresh and tasty. Twice as big as at Noah's Bagels and even more delicious! My son and I enjoyed the green tea milk ice blended drink with boba! REALLY good! Nice service too!<//Text>

Small yet nice place. Has only about 4 tables with 4 chairs each. The paying machine is very slow but the staff is very friendly. Menu is really full of variety. Quality of the food is good. I tried Gardein Sandwich with Pesto Bagle, and Post Veggie sandwich with Pesto Bagle, both were equally amazing. Would recommend this place for a slightly different take on bagle. cheers !</Review>

Good tasting food, but poor costumer service. Everytime I've been there, a certain employee gives off an apathetic vibe. Also, they aren't very cautious of food allergies. A girl almost got an allergic reaction because no one played attention to the cleanliness of the counters, knives, etc even after the customer specifically asked if the area was clean.</Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The service is really messed up.I got a salad of potatoes.It was supposed to be eating and dying.But there was not a word that the staff was sorry.It's not the responsibility of the Mexican woman to say that the food is hurt. What do you do if you go to the hospital because you eat this? "Do not go here!

(Original)
서비스가 정말 엉망이에요.썪은 감자 샐러드가 나왔어요.먹고 죽을거 같았어요.그런데 직원이 미안하다는 말 한마디도 없었어요.멕시칸 여자 직원이 하는 말이 음식이 상한건 자기 책임이  아니래요.”내 딸들이 이거 먹고 아파서 병원에 가면 어떻게 할거냐”따졌어요.이곳에 가지 마세요!!<//Review>

< review>
The tender chicken was the best chicken I had in years. So soft and flavourful.. And the owner also happened to be in the restaurant and he came over and talked to us and he was just so passionate about the food and gave us some background on how some of the items in the menu were introduced. The food was really tasty. I became a fan of Vietnam</review>

<Review>Food is incredible and the owner has the best and most honest personality. Seriously good. Ate in and also ordered a bahn mi to go. Best garlic noodles I've ever had in my life and the veggie pho broth was delicious.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM57PLsdO-oSrUI0lc7fxAkjf5PGhVqW_XaB4Qm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhOuoBZJWhk4FJf0c2zdxuJGqRkYW7UWMcGBWr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

Delicious food.  My favorites are the pumpkin curry and sauteed eggplant/tofu.  I sometimes get takeout (only because I live close by) and am usually surprised at how few people are here, because the food is great, the atmosphere quiet, and the decor pleasant .  The only disappointment for me (ever) has been the brown rice, which isn't quite what I'm used to.  It's seldom busy, but don't let that deter you!  Glad to give this great little place a thumbs up.< /text>

I try to tell everyone I serve to please let us know if something is wrong and we'll try to fix it.  Sounds like your hubby had the peanut coconut sauce.  Unfortunately, it historically is one of our most popular dishes, but if you come back, please tell the server less coconut  and not so thick and we'll do our best to accommodate !  We've been making it thicker on purpose because our previous customers from 20-30 years ago wanted it like before .... we're happy to tweak it to your taste."}<//Response>< text>
I loved the pho ga but my hubby got a stir fry and rice dish that was too heavy and sweet with coconut.</text>

Just amazing for the cost and quality of flavors.  Too bad they don't have beer, but there's a store across the street.  Try the Pad Thai and the Red curry.  The way a local thai place should be; accessable, affordable and flavorful.< /text>

All the staff is great, I will let any of them do my eyebrows. Tina is great just like her staff. My eyebrows last almost 3 weeks without needing to be retouched. I brought my mom and she liked it too.<//text>

Many great wines that we enjoy in California and known in the world come from Paso Robles. Justin is a must to visit while in Paso, please ( not sure if is still available after covid-19) be sure to book a tour, while seating down at the bar and enjoy many of wine from the portfolio, nothing compares to the tour that will take you everywhere in the vineyard, including the famous isosceles cellar and private dinner table underneath nestled underneath a mountain. This tour won't let you down, as you visit different spots wine will be pour from different vintages and styles. Be sure to book in advance as this kind of tour won't be available for walk ins.< /Text>

The staff of this vineyard are friendly and have a great knowledge to help to pick the wine for you. At the mean time, the view are so nice. This vineyard should be the top 3 of this area<//Review>

This is the worst restaurant experience that we have encountered. I normally don't give any bad reviews, especially during COVID 19 since the restaurants and wineries are facing a challenging time. However, I was so upset about our visit on April 24. It's our first time visited Justin Winery and Restaurant. When the hostess led us (party of three) to our table, it's in the hallway and right next to a door with a lot of traffics which guests and waiters will walk around. I especially mentioned that we don't feel comfortable with our mask off eating while a bunch of people is walking around. I pointed to an empty table of 4 seats in the garden area if we can switch to that table, but I was told by the hostess that "according to their policy", the table of 4 seats is only serving for 4 guests. While kept asking, they (with an impatient attitude) finally willing to switch us to the garden area. Guess what?? I have seen few tables of 4 seats over there only seated with two or three guests. I was so shocked but still tried to remain polite and say thank you to the hostess, and she just turned her head and walked away.  I don't know how the restaurant trains their staff, the hostess is rude and their service is appalling. It was our first time visiting Justin and will be our last time as well.</Text>

<text>Justin is a premium winery with excellent tasting options and food which will match any high end restaurant.

Located in the middle of the Paso Robles vineyards, it’s an excellent scenic drive to their establishment. When you arrive, you drive on loose gravel and are greeted by a welcoming staff.

Besides the excellent wine, the staff here are exceptional and very geared towards making your stay that much more enjoyable. You’re treated like royalty.

The seating area is booked right up against the vineyards which makes for a wonderful viewing. When tasting wine, it gives you a great sensation of tasting what you can see and makes you imagine the process of turning the grapes into the succulent nectar of wine, From farm to wine glass.

Price wise it is expensive, but they offer an excellent deal where for ever $100 you spend on wine bottles to go, the tasting fee ($35-$55) is completely waived. This made for an excellent tasting experience and if you plan on getting bottles to go, makes it a no brainer to do the bottles to go.

This is my personal favorite winery of all time and over the years, each wine has failed to disappoint. Their blends make for an exceptional tasting experience where taste buds are taken on a journey from a light hearted rose to a full bodied blend which takes you to euphoria.

Definitely a must for Paso Robles and is always on my list anytime I find myself in the area.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUM5ny0ZbdDyjKs32-zoaMqDCHtAY5Eu_ucDsl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJd1AKBEhGF5L34jUgoL3UW-hjS-SUCTlnwoRo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO50AgMLeETJxDCj0-eBf04zUjLmCGtm3m2kbi_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

This is my favorite wine in the world. I drove from Seattle to visit this winery. Their website said open at 10, the sign by their front door said open at 10. I got there just before 10. They do not open until 11. The guy who "helped" me yesterday was unfriendly and unwilling to cooperate in order for me to have a good experience. I left very disappointed.</text>

We really enjoyed our time here. The wine was great the food was great. A small downside is that the facility is far in the countryside and not near anything else. Even with that, we would go back.<//Text>

Do the private tasting at the Chateau and have lunch by Winery enjoying the views.

Great winery in Paso Robles to spend the afternoon. Try their Isosceles and Focus wines. Do the private tasting by the Castle  and enjoy the view of the vineyards at their outdoor restaurant. Our burgers were a bit overcooked but they make it up to us. Their service was great! Will definitely recommend< /text>

This was Sooooo disappointing!!!!
I absolutely love Justin Wines, especially the Isosoles.
This was our experience...
After being completely WOWED by Law Winery... their customer service was fantastic, knowledgeable and very intimate. My expectations for Justin was big based on what I had heard and the price point for their wines.
Customer service was completely shocking.
Our server.....shirt wrinkled, hair unkept, unable to make any eye contact....her idea of describing wine at best was that it is "heaven".  At one point she brought back out our last two flights and said she needed to leave them at our table because close to closing the wine just seems to dissappear.  After purchasing $700 worth of wine we asked for a few more drops of wine and her response was all bottles were closed now.  Even though they were getting ready for dinner.
She got a $20 tip but I feel like that was actually generous for the service received. Never want to go back.</review>

My wife and I are members of the Justin society for almost 20 years now. We had lunch with friends and were promptly seated, however, that was the end of the speedy service. We waited for over 15 minutes for another wine glass, my wife had to get up and retrieve a glass from the bar. We continued to wait for our waitress while conversing, but after more than 20 minutes, no waitress had approached our table. We waived a wItress asking what the delay was. Finally a waitress took our order and proceeded to get our water. Again, we waited at least another 10 minutes until she took our order. We waited and waited, but our order was nowhere in sight. When they finally brought our order the order was not correct. It was unfortunate since our friends were there and left very disappointed with the service.</Text>

We're members and had only been to the Tasting room in Downtown Paso Robles. We were impressed with the winery location and facilities. We sat on the patio because we had our dog with us and they were quite accommodating. We did make a reservation. We look forward to more visits. We want to do the tours, especially the Cave Tour.</Review>

Loved all the wines I tried here, made me a big fan of Rose and reds... Beautiful atmosphere and great service.  Due to time constraints no dining, look forward to getting back there to try their food!< /review>

We went for a quick wine tasting, ordered the Cheeseburger with fries. They were quick with the order and wine came out timely. Cheeseburger was tasty and fries were skinny and also cooked just right. We liked the Rose on the wine tasting menu.<//Review>

The wine is excellent.
The tasting facility is very beautiful and new, you are enveloped by the allure of wine and vineyard.
Our hostess Krystal was as sweet and down to earth as she could be and made us feel very comfortable.
The wine was absolutely lovely.
We tasted out on the "upper patio" and quickly learned that no tasting was allowed on the lower patio in the sun (it was chilly outside), that was our first indication of "not friendly".
Finished our tasting, my friend went into the tasting room/gift shop to use the restroom. I stayed outside for a few moments and followed there after.
As soon as I entered the tasting room a man approached me, and curtly asked if he could help me.
Honestly, I felt like I was trespasser in the way he addressed me!
(I am 63 years old, well dressed, and unassuming)
Good lawd...and then approached by another man in almost the same fashion. Really took me by surprise...these people need to chill.
That being said, the tasting atmosphere at Justin is very snooty and almost paranoid.
If you can get past that, the wine is fabulous.< /Review>

The wine may be fabulous but the attitude of the hosts left a bitter taste. With a near monopoly on wine tasting and outdoor dining in the Nacimiento area, the hosts attitude seemed to be - you're lucky to get a spot at Justin winery restaurant. That may be true but graciousness is valuable and was lacking. During Covid times we all need to show a little grace.< /text>

<Text>Love the view here, and it's always full of people from LA and the Bay. It's nestled in a beautiful valley outside Paso Robles, and the drive there is a thrill for those who enjoy winding curvy roads with blind curves and blind hills. There are moments when you literally creat a hill and you don't know if the road will curve to the right or left or if there'll be a drop of several feet. Beautiful road. The winery itself has great ambience, and is family friendly to a degree. Their outdoor seating is comfortable and tables are far apart from each other to afford some privacy and ensures nobody feels bothered by another group. Truly lovely corner of California here.</Text>< user_id>

<Review>Ordered case of 2017 Cab from their website for $236. Wine arrives today and the bottles are clanking in the box.  I open the box and discover they are half bottles stuck in full bottle packing hence the reason for the noise. Photo on their site doesn’t show it next to a regular sized bottle it looks like a regular bottle. Price was about what I buy a regular bottle for at Sams Club. Shame on me, I just looked at the picture and the price and assumed it was the same size.

I reached out to them and their reply was we state it is a 375ml and the photo clearly shows the smaller bottle. Then says “cheers”.

Whatever Justin. Won’t buy your wine again.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Rate>2<//Rate><review>I love Justin Wines and was really excited to make the pilgrimage to the vineyard.  My girlfriend and I arrived early for a tasting and found the tasting room sterile, boring, and lacking of character and vibe.  The employees were distracted, not at all excited, and the wine pours took much longer than they should have.  Its a shame because the wines have a great reputation, but unfortunately, i must report that the vineyard is worth a skip.  Your time and money will be better spent at a more intimate venue that feels less like a wine factory, and more like an experience, and that's coming from a fan.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Gets a lot of hate locally (mention Justin at any Paso Robles winery and you'll get a look of annoyance), but let's face it--these guys make the best wine in Paso, and it ain't close. Did the wine tour and it was wonderful! I think we paid maybe $30 and that included pours of justification, isosceles, and isosceles reserve. Can't beat that. Our tour guide was great and the grounds were beautiful. Will be back in February!</Review><user_id>110451036639045810226< /user_id>< Response>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>Although we're from Lodi in Northern California where we have dozens of wineries that make exceptional wines one of our very favorite wineries is Justin.  We've been members of Justin for several years and we always look forward to attending the Harvest Festival Dinner in October but because our son is getting married at the same time as the Harvest Dinner this year we decided to go in August and have dinner at the Restaurant at Justin and it was amazing!!!  The dinner menu is prix fixe and some might think it's a bit pricey but it was worth every single cent!  Our server was Amanda and she did a wonderful job of describing each course of food and wine.  Each course was so thought out and tasty and the wine pairings were perfect!  Thank you Amanda for making our experience so great, we can't wait to come back!!!<//text>< name>

<review>Felt like the prices were extremely overpriced. Expensive tastings for what they pour. Better off buying a few glasses of something you enjoy..

Also had lunch and ordered the burger. Looked amazing and perfectly cooked medium rare; however, it was dry like meatloaf. Imagine they don't do a appropriate meat to fat ratio which is what dictates juiciness which it completely lacked.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Absolute perfection! The tasting room and porch are lovely. There's a cute shop, Fiji water is served and the staff are awesome! Rachel took such good care of us and went out of her way to help us get into the tour. We had wine shipped to our home in AZ and it only took a few days for delivery.

The tour: So much fun! Make sure to schedule in advance because it's only twice a day and only 10 people are allowed on each tour. Anthony was our tour guide and did a fantastic job. It lasted about an hour and was partially in door, partially out door.

Oh and the wine is excellent :)<//text>< pictures>

If there was a way to give no stars for my recent experience at Justin Winery I would.  I decided to take my entire office staff on a wine tasting trip for their Christmas Party.  I had never been to Justin Winery, so this winery was the one that I was most excited to visit.  When we arrived, luckily, it was not very busy.  There were maybe 5 tables outside and 5 people inside the winery tasting room.  We sat down and waited to be greeted.  When our wine representative came over to the table, Gregory, he was less than friendly.  He did not smile, nor did he try and talk with us to see why we were there, the reason for the visit, etc.  He also did not explain the wines that we would be tasting.  We got our first pour of wine after about 10 to 15 minutes of waiting.  During this time, one of my staff members told Gregory that one of his family members wanted to join the wine club.  Of course, he immediately started working on that on the phone inside.  After we waited and waited for our second pour of wine, one of my employees finally had to go into the actual building and ask for a second pour from another wine representative.  When, Gregory finally finished his phone call and came out with the second pour of wine, he made a comment about my staff member that went into the building to ask for our second pour.  After rolling his eyes, he stated, "Well if she would just quit hounding me" I would come out here and pour wine.  This was the first time anyone had went inside the building.  Gregory was unprofessional, extremely rude, and an outright negative individual.  I have no idea how he would even be able to obtain a job such as this.  Because of my experience with Gregory, I may never go back to Justin.  It is too bad because the wine is very nice!< /review>

One of my favorite wines and has been for more than 2 decades.  And you can imagine my excitement when I found out that a family members vineyard (emerald hills) got chosen to supply grapes.   Guess I will be drinking this even more.<//Text>

Great atmosphere and spacious outdoor seating. Wine selection was great but not the best I've had. This is coming from someone that prefers craft brews than wine.<//Review>

<Review>The wines are always great. I can't say that for the person giving us the tastings. It could have been a really busy day, but we spent most of the afternoon waiting for FOUR tastings out on the patio and almost left because it took so long. Either more staff was needed or like I said, it could have been an off day for them. The lady got our groups orders wrong and I ended up walking inside to buy my wine because I probably would have had to wait and extra 30 min or so just to put my order in. The tasting fee is $25 or it's waived if you make a purchase of $75 or more.<//Review><Response>None</Response><Rating>3< /Rating><Name>Stephanie Del Carmen<//Name><pictures>None</pictures>< UserId.>

<review>Their tasting room is beautiful and modern. The wines are hit or miss, it all depends on what you like. The tasting includes a lot of variety. If you know you don't like certain wines, don't get the tasting. You are better off getting a pour of your favorite type of wine.<//review><rate>3< /rate>< Pics>

I drove from Morro Bay all the way to Paso for Justin and it was 100% worth it. If you like cabs and red blends, you will love this place. Even their Rose surprised me. Erin was very friendly and knowledgeable. Everyone was nice and the place has a very non intimidating atmosphere. Definitely worth the visit, can't wait to go back.< /Text>

< Review>
Justin is a long time fixture in the Paso Robles wine scene with a long time reputation of producing fine wines. However, to my palate the wines have lost much of their luster and on a recent visit we found the "new", bigger tasting room to be modern but cold, impersonal, crowded and loud. Not at all an improvement from their smaller and cozier tasting experience provided by the prior owners. And now there are many winemakers in the area making as good or better wines... at lesser prices.<//Review>

Beautiful winery with a nice restaurant. Dina served our wine outside on the patio.

The food menu is somewhat limited and a bit pricey, but very enjoyable, especially out on the patio. I’ll definitely return</review>

<Text>Great winery to visit!!!

One of the best winery to visit on Paso Robles area. 3 main areas: dining room, patio, bbq area overseeing the winery.

Wine tasting costs about $30++/person.
Need RSVP for dining.

Membership doesnt cost anything, only need to buy a few bottles per year, waived wine tasting if taking this membership chance.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Great facility, great wine, and the staff are so knowledgeable.

Justin takes the French philosophy to wine making by embracing the blends.  I don't believe I tasted a single wine made from one specific varietal... such as Cabernet Sauvignon.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<text>More than we expected.  Read the reviews while driving up, so anticipating "Napa valley", we got quite the excellent experience instead.  Note:  Wednesday afternoon, showed up for tasting, and wine / cave tour of the operation.  Everyone we met was warm and personable, making us (not wine experts) feel at home.  Our Justin tour guide (Crystal) turned out to be super friendly and knowledgeable.  She patiently answered all of our questions too.  We look forward to visiting a second time in August during harvest.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Overpriced, overhyped, corporate owned winery. Went for lunch. The food was tasteless, lacked seasoning, and was overcooked and mushy. Service was fine. Best part was the Negrantis sheep ice cream but you can get that in Paso for much less. Save time and money and go the hundreds of other wineries and restaurants in the area that have excellent wine and food at better prices.< /text></record></dataset><record>

We visited Justin on 14 Oct 17 and I have to say had an amazing tour of your vineyard.
Our guide For the tour was great, he had great knowledge of the art of making wine,and sense of humour.
The wines we tasted were supperb and I have to say I would like to drink your Isosceles for the rest
of my life.but living in the UK makes that impossible, ( you need to export to UK ).Please.
Justin is a must visit if you love your wine and in the Paso Robles area.
We hope to be back one day.
Sue and Martin Cooper.< /Review>

<Review>Large group went for lunch, with a reservation. We had some vegetarians and had called ahead to ensure they had options. They didn't when we got there, but offered to make something. Service was horribly slow, portions were small and the comment at the table was "well at least it's edible". Not a glowing remark for what was not an inexpensive meal. Would not visit again.< /Review>< name>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I am rating it this high for the lunch that we had at the restaurant. The hamburger was amazing, easily one of the best burgers I've eaten in my life. One of my friends got the pasta, and it was absolutely perfect. I tried two different wines as part of lunch, and both were very, very good. The location is idyllic, too. Waaaaay out in the country, on a patio surrounded by vineyards, next to the kitchen's vegetable garden. It is hard to beat.<//text>< pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Their tasting menu is very good, and they frequently offer samples of their higher end reserve wines.  Their Cab is very good, the reserve cab is fantastic.  Some of the wines available are difficult to find, or unavailable, at other retail outlets.  The place is very corporate, but that is not bad too me. The tasting room is beautiful and modern. The staff is very friendly, and the restaurant and atmosphere...dare I say it...is worth the price.  Some of the comments here make me think that they were at a different winery, or that they were the reason behind the bad experience. You can find better wines in the area, but probably not a single vineyard with as many high quality wines.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The BFF is such a fan of Justin Vineyard and after our tasting experience, I get it now.  Party of 13 please....

We stopped in on a hot Saturday afternoon and Larry was our tasting guide.   He was friendly, professional and we learned plenty about the wines we sampled as well as the Justin Vineyard and history.  We had rookies and seasoned Wine veterans and Justin worked well with both.
Our tasting included:
2016 Viognier - Light, refreshingly perfect for the hot day.
2016 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon - Best Cabernet I've tasted this year.
2016 Reserve Tempranillo - Dark, deep, tasty.
2016 Reserve Malbec - Love Malbecs and this might be my new fav.  I purchased two bottles as souvenirs
2015 Isoceles Reserve - Award winner, lovely and I'll be stashing a bottle at home.

The lobby and showroom is spacious and organized well.  They have plenty of Justin items that covers souvenirs, apparel, to wine accessories of course.  You can also pick up some snacks, cheese, crackers to add to your tasting experience.

In the patio there's some great patio seating with great view of this lovely property with the vines and the mountains in the distance.  There are definitely plenty of social media moments here.  If in the area, Justin is a definite visit to enjoy some great wine and make even greater memories.  Cheers!< /Text>

When my mother and I went here the first time, we got to try their Isosceles Reserve. My mother looked at me and said that this was the wine Jesus made at Cana. Their best wines are like being wrapped in a blanket with laughter and joy. Their wines are stupendous and the environment is elegant and lovely. Go here.< /Text>

The wine was fantastic, the setting is beautiful and our first tasting was lovely until our server went to lunch. Our new server told us at that the price was more than we were told when we came in because we had 8 people. That's after we had the wine tastings. I don't mind paying more but the to be told that after we had a tasting is not right. Sorry I bought a few bottles of wine. Won't be back.</Review>

<text>Dinner at Justin was over-the-top great in every way:  service, food, wine, atmosphere.  Be prepared to pay big-city prices for it, but for a splurge or special occasion it's totally worth it.  The five-course prix fixe dinner was two hours of intense, perfectly matched flavors.  The wine pairings were amazing.  The Justin reserve cabernet is an incredible wine.  We would definitely make the (very long) drive again!<//text><Resp>None</Resp><time>1325393218417</time><pictures>None<//pictures>< name>

It’s ridiculous, they were completely understaffed and poorly coordinated, they made us feel super uncomfortable and unwelcome, would never visit again...

< Review>
We have been here twice and both times felt like it was "Meh". Not sure if I can justify the drive all the way up here. Much rather go to Halter Ranch or Adelaide.</Review>

<username>Devin Ramdutt</username><Date>1435470113718<//Date><Rate>4</Rate><text>Open and airy tasting room as well as ample seating in the outdoor section. The wines were decent and actually enjoyed their 2013 Cab and Justification blend more than their signature Isosceles. The Cab was very reasonably priced at $26 but the signature wines seemed a bit over priced at $50 to $65. The tasting room was quite busy, but they had enough staff and space that we didn't feel neglected or cramped.
Also had lunch at the restaurant (separate review) which I would recommend.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Was looking forward to checking this winery out on our upcoming trip until we read about their total disrespect of the land and their community. Will never go there or buy their wine and would urge others to do some reading before giving them your business. Total shame..<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>we had a great time . All the staff were  top notch.  The only problem is the change of stageing, it was very uncomfortable standing in the parking lot ,then led through what appeared to  be  a maintenance area around back.        The old venue was much more comfortable. Still a wonderful time . Just a bit awkward from previous visits.<//review>< user>

Love love me some Justin! I didn’t drink until I tried Ontuse. My  hairdressers serves it up all of the time. He  was serving up some one day and I had a sip.  I’m now a wine-o...Been hooked ever since. Obtuse is to die for and they are always sold out. We are members of their wine club and  considering an upgrade! Headed to the vineyard for The Champ’s (my hubby) Birthday.< /Review>

Always been a big fan of the isosceles, but the quality has gone down. The restaurant next to the tasting area takes away the charm that it once had. To make it worse, the Wonderful Company purchased them and recently cleared 100 acres of oak trees so they can plant more grapes.<//review>

Really liked the 2013 Isosceles and the 2013 Savant from the tasting menu. Beautiful contemporary setting in the Tasting room. For driving enthusiasts, the drive to this vineyard is a lot of fun. Watch out for deers.</Text>

<text>The restaurant is very nice, has a view of the vineyard and is covered and heated. My burger was delicious, maybe a little less pink than I would have liked but amazing none the less. The fries, which come in a sharable order are also great. Maybe it was the day we visited but they were missing isosceles and the cab sauv(which are my two favorite) from the tasting room. The wine was good but sort of missing the umph that you expect.<//text>< user_id>

GREAT Wine!  Fun tours. Be sure your driver stays on property during your lunch\tour b.c you have to transfer from the tasting room\restaurant to the celler.<//review>

If you use Uber or Lyft and don't have your driver stay you will be stranded.   Uber has a great service called UberWine.   Check it out< /Text>

< Review>
Don't waste your time driving to this sterile and stuffy over rated corporate office building. Over-rated. There is nothing inviting about this place at all. Everyone from the greeter to the manager acted like a snob. It was a Friday afternoon, almost nobody there and they made us wait 15 minutes before we could have the privilege of standing in front of their so-called wine expert. The wine was so so. Don't bother !</Review>

Way overcrowded and over-commercial. I felt like we were standing in a gift shop. Our overworked server was sweet but hurried, and was unimpressed with the wines. Also owned by the least ethical water company in the world, Fiji.</Text>

<text>JUSTIN Vineyards and Winery is a beautiful place to stop for wine tasting, lunch, and a winery tour. The tasting room and restaurant stands out like a contemporary ranch house amongst the surrounding vineyards. Row upon row of vines stretch across the land and hills like fine stitch work. If you decide to stay for lunch, here are a few suggestions from the menu:

A great way to try the wines while enjoying a meal is with a flight. The White Wine Flight includes 2014 JUSTIN Sauvignon Blanc, 2014 JUSTIN Rosé, and 2013 Landmark Overlook Chardonnay. The Sauvignon Blanc has a pear nose. Green apple and peach flavors are experienced on the palate with a light, clean finish. Rating: 3.5/5. The Rosé has a blackberry and cherry aroma. Strawberry and grapefruit flavors are experienced on the palate with a nice, clean finish. Rating: 4.5/5. The Chardonnay has a white grape and pear aroma. White grape, pear, floral, and mineral flavors experienced on the palate. Rating: 2.5/5

Windrose Farm Lamb Tartare is topped with garden greens, preserved lemon aioli, and crostini. This was a fantastic take on tartare. The lamb was sweet and minced perfectly. The use of shaved egg yolk added a richness to the dish without the mess of a runny egg yolk. The fresh greens from the garden paired nicely. Rating: 4.5/5

JUSTIN Fries are tossed with truffle salt, parmesan, and JUSTIN fine herb blend. The fries were light and crispy. The truffle flavor was just right so the parmesan and herbs could shine as well. Rating: 4.5/5

Bucatini Pasta tossed with Alle-Pia sausage, wild mushrooms, bitter greens, smoked butter, and parmesan. This was an excellence lunch dish, light yet satisfying. The sauce had a rich creamy texture. The flavors of the succulent mushrooms and lean, meaty sausage balanced perfectly with the sauce and pasta. Rating: 4.5/5

JUSTIN Brownies topped with caramel, cocoa nibs, and served with lemon balm ice cream. The brownie was served warm with rich, decadent chocolate flavor. Caramel sauce made the dish more luxurious. The lemon balm ice cream was refreshing with unexpected herbal notes. It was different and made a nice contrast to the brownie. Rating: 3.8/5

After lunch, a walking tour is a great way to burn some calories. JUSTIN Vineyards and Winery offers tours of their facility. Be sure to call ahead for a reservation as the tours are limited to 10 people per tour. Our tour guide, Larry, took us around the winery, showing us the machinery used to mill and press the grapes during harvest and the large stainless steel tanks used for the fermentation process. He then walked us through the caves where the different wines are aged in French Oak barrels. You will also be tasting wine along the way - Rosé, Merlot, Petit Syrah, and Reserve. You'll also notice that scattered around the vineyard are poles with metal boxes on top. They sort of look like large bird houses. They are homes for the owls who rid the vineyards of rodents and snakes. They let nature take on the job of pest control so chemical pesticides are not used.

After the tour, head back to the tasting room to sample and purchase your favorite wines. Take a walk around the on-site vegetable garden where they grow the produce that is ultimately going to end up on your plate in the restaurant - kale, different varieties of lettuce, edible flowers, Swiss chard, and more. Lady bugs and praying mantis are also natural pest controllers and are on patrol here as well.< /text>< user>

<gmapID>0x80ed29f7f823a82d:0xb550b7414f39c66d</gmapID><Review>(Translated by Google) Honestly, I found the cost of the tasting menu of only 5 wines excessive, in fact the price was 25 dollars. Basically two and a half dollars a sip.
The place is particularly beautiful relaxing well maintained and located between 12 and 15 miles from the center of Paso Robles.
The locality is surrounded by Vigne is a small garden of aromatic herbs and Olives.
inside, as well as wine tastings, themed accessories and flavored oils are also offered.
The wines are certainly of quality, but not such as to justify the price paid.
In the city center Justin offers a small secondary center for tasting their wines.
The outdoor veranda is interesting, surrounded by aromatic plants, on several levels, which offers small corners where you can have lunch or dinner in the more reserved areas.

(Original)
Sinceramente ho trovato eccessivo il costo del menu di assaggio di soli 5 vini, il prezzo infatti era di 25 dollari. Praticamente due dollari e mezzo a sorso.
Il luogo è particolarmente bello rilassante ben curato e distante tra le 12 e le 15 miglia dal centro di Paso Robles.
La località è circondata da Vigne è un piccolo orto di erbe aromatiche e Olivi.
all'interno vengono offerte oltre che assaggi dei vini anche accessori a tema e oli aromatizzati.
I vini sono sicuramente di qualità, ma non tali da giustificare il prezzo pagato.
Nel centro città Justin offre un piccolo secondario centro per l'assaggio dei loro vini.
Interessante la veranda esterna, circondata da piante aromatiche, su più livelli, che offre piccoli angoli dove poter pranzare o cenare nella penombra zone più riservate.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< rate>
