< review>
Being originally from Jersey, I go here for a sub sandwich. The staff at this location always do a great job making my sandwich. The rest of the family get their sandwiches "boring" (little condiments). I get mine "Jersey style"...so with lots of everything...it should be messy. Staff is usually friendly.</review>

<Review>New favorite sandwiches, having high quality sandwiches like these makes me never want to have a Subway sandwich ever again. The Italian sub Mike's way is my definite favorite, and I definitely will be eating here many times. In my eyes, I haven't ever had a sandwich this good.</Review>< pictures>

All the ingredients are fresh the bread was delicious the only dry back that I can see is there could have been a little bit more meat but on the sandwich.< /text>

Before taking a bite my daughter noticed hair hanging out of her sandwich. We put the hair on a napkin and took the sandwich back  to location.  We had  to prove where the hair was on the sandwich. My daughter stepped into the food prep area and actually showed them 3 more strands of hair.  No apology given. Also noticed no hair nets for those food preparers with hair past their shoulders. Definite Health and Safety violations noted here.</text>

After being diagnosed with celiac, one thing I really missed was being able to go get a good, classic sub. Jersey mikes has delicious gluten free bread that doesn’t get soggy at all!!! It is so rare to find gluten free bread that doesn’t turn to mush with any drop of liquid, so that’s a huge win. The staff are ALWAYS so friendly and so accommodating with changing gloves and cleaning their station to help with cross contamination. The sandwiches are great, so I highly recommend for those with and without celiac!< /review>

< review>
I was born in Point Pleasant and have been to the original and I've been to a few other Jersey Mikes in California since they have opened some stores out here and this store is one of the worst. It is a glorified Subway, cheap on everything. You see those pictures, well their subs look nothing like those pictures. I've been to this location twice and both times the subs were not very good. The first time the bread was not fresh and was kind of hard. The sub I got from both visits barely had any toppings, maybe there were a few pieces of onions on it. I had to search for them because you could not tell. There was hardly any lettuce on it, a typical Jersey mikes sub does not skimp on these topping and if anything you have to ask for them to go light, well this location, you would swear there was a huge shortage on lettuce and onions, I guess at least they still covered it length wise with tomatoes. Overall, I was really disappointed in the quality of the sub at this location. Other locations are better than this one. One in Mountain View was probably the best and closest to the original I have been to out here.<//review>

My wife and I had not been to a Jersey Mike's before and thought we would try it out. This location has been open just a little over a week now. We were pleased with the service and friendliness of the staff. The sandwiches we ordered were well prepared and quite tasty.

We will be sure to come back again.< /Review>

Jersey Mike's is my favorite sandwich shop and I'm so happy they built one closer to where I live than rocklin. Great service and delicious sandwiches. My only minor complaint is I've been there twice since opening and they've been out of brownies both times. I will obviously be back ^^<//text>

< review>
I only recently started eating at Jersey Mike's, before this location opened. I'd go to the one in Rocklin, but we were treated poorly by the staff, as if we were bothering them by coming in for a sandwich. Once this location opened I have only been treated with the best customer service. The owner is often there and makes sure to greet everyone and learn their orders if they come often enough. The rest of the staff is typically in good spirits and very friendly. Such a difference in attitude. Plus the food is delicious! Thank you Jared!</review>

Mary was great! I called from Pittsburgh PA to order my little sister a gift for her birthday from the Walnut Creek  location since she lives close. Mary was pleasant, professional, and was very kind when my sister came to pick it up. My sister also commented that the security was kind as well! Thanks for helping me make my sister feel special in such a crazy time! I prefer dealing with people than the internet! Thanks again Mary at the Walnut Creek Location!</text>

Service is good. They will try to subtly upsell, but no pressure. Their salespeople are experienced and courteous, but going in with some idea of what you like/want will make the process much easier.

Edit: I should add that we ended up purchasing a beautiful round diamond half-circle wedding band. Fiancée is very happy.<//Review>

<text>My husband and I have been going to this Tiffany's store for a few years now, to get charms for my bracelet on special occasions, which was also purchased here. We have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars there, over that period of time. On November 5th, we made a trip there for my birthday, and when we walked up to the door, the door attendant was extremely rude, and it took us both aback, to the point that I was speechless for a moment. The first words out of his mouth weren't a greeting, like you would expect from an upscale store like this, he actually said, very loudly, without a bit of couth, "what are you here for?" And then when I couldn't find an answer because I was stunned, he got agitated, and said in a very condescending tone, "to shop or what??" I was floored! I did not get his name, but he was African- American. We drove close to two hours to go to this location for my birthday, when we could have gone to a store in Sacramento that's only an hour away, because we like this store, but he dampened our mood for sure. I gave the two stars for the salesman that helped us once we were actually in the store because he was very friendly and helpful. To sum this up, the door attendant needs a brush up on courtesy and professionalism when dealing with customers, because his behavior was unacceptable.<//text>< user>

Have tried to call the store five times over two days trying to get a person on the line and waited and waited for no answer. I emailed the store and haven't heard a peep in 36hrs. Called the San Francisco store and got a live person on the phone in 5 seconds that answered my question in 30 seconds. Would have preferred to shop at this location, but if their service is as bad as their phone and email response then no thanks... Sounds like others here have had the same issue, so save yourself the headache and go elsewhere or order online...< /review>

I have had a very bad experience with the Walnut Creek store, in that NO ONE EVER answers the phone. I have left numerous voice mails and have NEVER received a call back. I had to drive out there to get help. Once again I am trying to order something over the phone but looks like it’s another drive. It’s really ridiculous’n
What is the problem. And by the way when I did drive out there, there was one customer in the besides me and I was in the store for at lest half an hour.<//text>

<review>I truly love Tiffany’s- for so many reasons.  The least of which is their impeccable service.  I had an item repaired and ran out of time before an upcoming trip to go into the store to pick it up.  Asked if they could send it out to me and they said, “of course, no problem”!  Pure class!  Thanks and we will be back to shop in the future!< /review><Rate>5<//Rate><user_id>113276472943580303303< /user_id></record>

I came here to use the $250 gift certificate I got from the Amex Platinum card benefit. It's hard to find something costs this range, anything with diamond is at least $800, my wife picked out a tiny pair of earrings around $300 at the end, the service lady was very helpful and friendly, she was patient and understood we were only looking for something that small.< /text>

First time at the Walnut Creek Tiffany & Co. and it was a very pleasant experience. Within a couple of minutes of walking in, Mary greeted me and asked if I was helped. She helped me locate a gift I was looking for and promptly had it boxed (with suggestions for how to box it since I was traveling with it) and I was on my way! Will definitely be visiting this Tiffany location for all my gifting needs!<//Review>

I have been shopping at Tiffany since 2009 and after moving to the Bay Area I have visited this located many times to make purchases and to get my wife's items checked. I worked with a great consultant via email to help find the right ring, and after many email exchanges, I went in and got the ring picked, ordered, and it came in perfect. I do recommend the semi check up on the jewelry, prongs, can get loose and you definitely do not want to loose the stones. When you get it back it loose brand new too.

Sometimes it can get busy, weekends, and around the holidays, so go mid-week or off times so you can park easily and get the attention you need.<//Review>

STAY AWAY!!! This place has to be a joke. If there is such a thing as retail trolling then this is it. Everything here is 10x the price while also 1/10th the size of most places. Plus the diamonds in the necklaces and rings I looked at were not that great. Sure their jewelry is nice, but not better than any of the other top jewelry stores in the area. So why pay way way over the top prices? On top of that, all three times I've been in here I was treated with such snobbery. I will never set foot in a Tiffany's ever again!< /Review>

I’m so sad to say I had not one, but THREE bad experiences here- I honestly should have written the company. I’ve been to several Tiffany’s across the country and never received such poor customer service. And on top of the lack of service, they were RUDE. I’m guessing because they thought I wasn’t going to buy anything...? Bizarre. I definitely will not be back to this location.< /review>

There's never been the same person working when I come, whether it's within a week or months.  Sure, the person could have the day off, but when I ask for specific reps, the answer is always "that person no longer works here".   I'm a loyalist.  I like to go to the same coffeehouses, restaurants, movie theaters, shops, and have the same salesperson, so when there's a revolving door, in the back of my mind I think "unstable". For the money spent, I would rather have world-class customer service and the reps that no longer work there have always been accommodating (showing merchandise, answering questions, etc.) and have always provide world-class service.<//Review><Time>1429635682246< /Time>< user_name>

<Review>Big sense of let down after visiting the Walnut Creek store today.

I had come in with a gift card and looking forward to making a purchase. A saleslady helped me by bring out a bracelet for me to try on, then asked her to verify my $200 gift card amount, which she did and brought it back to me. I was browsing a few other cases in the back of the store, came back to the front and she was already helping another customer and showing them something out of the case! I felt totally written off, it was like she had assumed I was finished without asking me and had moved on to another potential client.

I was so disappointed, I felt like I didn't count. I was looking forward to the whole Tiffany's experience; getting great service and walking out of the store with something new, but now I don't even care to go back to the store.<//Review>< pics>

<review>This place is horrible !!! The employee who is taking the payments by the name of Christian has no shame and should be fired. He literally pocketed the $30 I paid. He first placed the bills under a sheet of paper and then placed it in his left back pocket .. This place is unethical and should have cameras installed!!!< /review><Date>1579223404981</Date>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Do not trust their math. Even when my sister asked them what was going to be her total out the door, they gave her a low price. When she accepted, then they gave the full price (an extra $150 or so).
They pretended that she misunderstood them, but I was there. I heard what they said. Other comments are saying similar stories.

The metro store at Felspar is close-by and they are honest about prices. At:

< Review>
Horrible experience more than once too, my mom has had her phone number for 20 years, mom was trying to change from boost to metro, they said they could do it so they charged my mom a bunch of money.. then next day her phone doesn’t receive calls .. turns out at metro they didn’t tell us that the phone number couldn’t be switched, so my mom lost her phone number ,they half - a*** It to get my moms money, now they won’t give us a refund. I personally love metro but not this location the people are rude and pushy, i don’t know why they haven’t closed down yet</Review>

I recently bought a phone and when I walked into the store I was surprised by the wonderful greetings I got. Automatically I was given the attention that I deserved. I recommend this place it is a great enviornment. Will return to pay bills and future phones</review>

<Response>None</Response><Review>Avoid this place! I sold my old phone and met with the buyer at the store for him to set up his phone. The older gentleman who was working the front desk is a total dick and was threatening us and put us on blast in the entire store because he assumed I was some low life thief who sold the guy a blacklisted phone. He made threats to hold on to the phone at the store until the cops came. I don't even use Metro PCS and bought my phone directly from Google factory unlocked and paid in full. No reasoning or proof would get through to him as he assumed we were lying and giving him "attitude".

Too bad he is an a**hole and entered the wrong IMEI number into the computer. Your attitude towards us sure changed after that huh? I wish the cops came so they can see how much of a dumba** you were. Next time, I hope you give the customers the benefit of the doubt instead of assuming everyone is guilty. Horrible customer service...< /Review><Name>Andy V</Name><rating>1</rating><Pics>None< /Pics>< date>

I hated metro before I went to this store. I was having multiple issues with my phone and the sales rep resolved all of them except for my cracked screen. And then he noticed I had an obama phone. He looked something up on his computer, after a minute he looked up at me and told me I qualify for 2 free galaxys if I port my old sh*tty obama over. I ended up throwing away my obama phone and my cracked phone and walked out with 2 samsungs!! Best customer service and amazing staff! I know where I'll be shopping for phones now</review>

CONS:

One female employee wore her mask around her chin and even though I kept looking at her giving the hint that maybe it’s not a good idea. Nope. So COVID precaution wise they need to reinforce that with their employees.

Zero pricing on anything. They do it on purpose because it’s pretty pricey. I guess that’s how you pay for the bathrooms!

PROS:

Free bathrooms which weren’t too bad.

Easy access off the freeway.

Subway inside.

Broad selection of things.

Maybe I’ll try the Chevron across the street next time? Be forewarned.<//text>

<Review>Stopped for gas and a quick bite to eat.  Overall, the cashier was helpful with answering my questions about the surroundings area and the restroom was clean.  I was in and out in 10 minutes.  Recommended.</Review>< pictures>

Initially I thought this was a piece of Real Estate on the tail end of some Indian Reservation that as times before have proved to me are the last place you want to have to stop and try to rest.

This was anything but and everything more that included clean bathrooms, cold ice cream, meaty sandwiches and smokey cigarettes.

Along with nice big old relaxed parking lot that doesn't require much thinking on how do properly navigate it's tight angles right and stay on the road left.

In my book that is something I like to know is possible after churning out the last 200 miles of straight nothing but heat and more heat nothingness filled road.

The less effort I have to put into the life I have is the life lived a little better for not.</Text>

<review>Gas station, mini mart, mini subway.  Selection of food was good, subway sandwiches are what you'd expect.  Gas prices are a bit high but it's in an isolated spot off of the I-8.< /review>< Rate>

<review>The best example of doing nothing and still getting paid I have ever seen. Only govt employees can do absolutely nothing and get to keep their job and get paid. This station will lie and say just about anything to avoid actually doing their job. I doubt any of the so called people at this place actually went to school. Biggest bunch of idiots ever.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>The most incompetent bunch of chuckleheads this side of the Mississippi. Your mail will not be there when you arrive. Expect for it to be missing but more probably stolen based on the quality of service. Instead of offering to look into it, they just say that "it's crazy" that your multiple packages aren't there.< /Review>< pictures>

It can be a little crowded sometimes. I’m here 4 to 5 times a week for business and I think the service is great. My customers often comment how fast they receive their orders and 95% of my shipping is Clovis USPS.< /Review>

They don't care. Rude and dismissive. I've had several packages say delivered but are no where to be found. It's been months of this. When talking to supervisor in person at post office, I get the dismissive attitude and told there's nothing they can do about packages that show as delivered but are nowhere. I'm missing two very important pieces of mail as well and when I let them know I didn't receive either one, as they requested,  I get nothing but silence.  Just an absolutely horrible organization.<//text>

Pam who works as the package receiver is a incompetent bigot. When entering the store she never asked if i needed help, provided “advice” thats was inaccurate and clearly did not listen to me when I told her my postage was paid for and im I just needed them to scan my bar code. I had to explain this too her 3 times before she could comprehend. End result i waited patiently for 30 minutes while she kindly helped another costumer, while i received rude, unhelpful advice and then told to drive 15 to get the service i needed at another post office</Review>

Customer service is trash. Expect snarky answers to your questions. While there I also observed a worker snap at a customer for pushing the wrong button during checkout.< /review>

<text>The last 2 of my visit at this post office they charged my letters extra for Non Mach. Surch., but my envelops were within a standard range. I measured all the time with scale. I tried to tell them last time, but they did not even try to listen to me or doubt their mistakes, so this time I didn't even fight about it. I hope every employee had same knowledge at least as much as customers do.< /text>< pics>

Couldn't get my box spring delivered on the date it was supposed to due to the driver being too lazy to want to put it in his truck from the office.  Had to go in person to pick it up instead of waiting an extra day for them to maybe consider putting it on.  Send your mail to any office but this one.</Text>

< Review>
I have had my mail delivered from this post office for five years and never one issue. I see my mail carrier around town from time to time and he's always nice and smiles. I visit the post office infrequently but there is always someone their with a smile and helpful.
I'm amazed at the negative reviews posted here. This is not a "Private Owned" Business where customer service is mandatory. THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT, have you ever been to any other place run by government at any level? It's only going to get worse as we move closer to Socialism! At the moment you can complain, but already it does no good.
Have you read the reviews on EVERY or any post office in Fresno?
I say these folks are doing a great job!
Some of you will have to lower your expectations of our GOVERNMENT run facilities.
CLOVIS POST OFFICE IS THE BEST!<//Review>

Parking lot is terrible. Speed of service is terrible,  not to mention procedures and processing is terrible. They make you get in and out of the line.  What is the purpose of the clerks if they don't know customer service?  If we do all the labor?  Not to mention the traffic and amount of people vs the staff.  I dread coming here.</text>

This 5-star review is a shout out to Irma who works here. I've never stepped foot in Clovis as I live out of state but when I called this Post Office and Irma picked up it was truly a blessing! There was an issue with a package I had sent and this wonderful woman helped me for the next few days (during Christmas, mind you, their busiest time of the year) to get the issue resolved. She was extremely kind, understanding, and patient and --by miles-- exceeded what any objective observer would consider her basic duties. I have honestly thought about flying to Clovis just to give Irma a big bear hug of appreciation. THANK YOU IRMA! MERRY CHRISTMAS!<//Review>

<Text>Just came in on a busy holi-day with 70lbs if media mail books.  Weighed it at home and it was just at 69lbs.  After waiting in a very long line the scale measured the box as over 70lbs.  I asked for a small bit of help - scissors to open and tape to close - and this request was declined.

I understand you can’t help everyone but the folks over on Nees were more than happy to help.  It is my belief that we ought to help one another, and even go out of our way to do good to others.  As a new parent, going out is extremely difficult so a small bit of help today could have gone a really long way (scissors and tape).   I am sorry you were unable or unwilling to offer help today and I do hope you all make it through the Holidays.

Blessings.< /Text>< Pics>

Very Unhappy with this branch at this time! I received a notice in my mailbox , "Sorry we missed you" for a package Ive been waiting for. I was home all day and there was not an attempt to deliver this package. So I attempt to call the post office to see if the package was at the office and not being "delivered" or in the truck, so I could go during my lunch to pick it up. After 2 hang ups, I received the automated service just to be told the wait time was 40min - 1hr. REALLY!! I was waiting on hold for about 20 min thinking there is no was the wait time is that long, when I was disconnected again. Now I have to go down during my lunch and hope it's there.</Review>

<review>I can't believe how quick, friendly and efficient this post office is! Wow! The lines are long and you think "aww man" but within like, 3-4 minutes, you are greeted by a friendly, smiling face saying " I can belp you". Talieah (I hope I spelled it right) in particular shines with spectacular service, knowledge and helpful customer service.

Horrible branch, 3 separate employees argued with me stating they are supposed to walk across lawns. Completely unprofessional. Went all the way up to the "PostMaster", he backed his employees decision to argue that he is supposed to walk across my lawn, while he was currently on my property, not one apology aside from the 1-800 number. I'mI'm pre sure the positive reviews are from employees, because I'm fairly positive get a total of 4 people in there a day. Horrible branch, non-existent customer service, was told "it's an issue of money crossing over lawns" I know, I pay to water my lawn, I don't need anyone walking on it.<//Review>

Every single time I come to this post office no matter the day or time there is a huge line of 15-20 people and only one person (2 of you're lucky) at the counter assisting customers. Ridiculous that it takes 30-40 minutes on line just to be served. Do better clovis USPS!</text>

I want to preface this by saying the postal workers I’ve encountered through deliveries have been kind and extremely helpful.

However I went in to drop off a package recently, the woman who I worked with was a dark haired, individual of Asian descent. I made an honest mistake of repackaging my item in an amazon box with a lithium battery warning on it. She asked me if that item was in there and after I informed her it was not and that was from the original packaging she rudely raised her voice and said that she would not accept the item and that I needed to remove the label. I was not trying to be deceitful or unkind however the way in which she handled an honest mistake was rather rude, in professional and unkind. She made no effort to inform me of USPS policy and any exceptions.

While I understand she was just trying to do her job and encounters a lot on a given day that is no excuse to treat anyone as I was treated.</text>

Wish I could give a 0 lol. I've called about 30 times since they've opened today, most calls ring for a few minutes then hang up, a few had a busy tone, one they answered, didn't say anything, then hung up. I'm paying you for a service, I expect to be able to ask a question by calling you, not ignore 30 phone calls spanning 2 hours.  I'd be fired if I did that at my job.< /Text>

FYI
There is other shipping places that do what the post office does plus a lot more.  In some cases you may pay a little more,  or a lot less.  Typically UPS and FedEx are less expensive then the post office after the package you are sending is more than 5 lbs. plus they give you tracking and insurance up to 100.00. For example check out Clovis Pack & Ship they are really helpful and clean.<//review>

<text>I have used this office for the last 20+ years. Anytime I go there the employees go out of their way to assist anyone needing help.  I prefer the USPS over private carriers that are more expensive and sometimes unreliable.  I have had negative experiences with those and NONE with the US Post Office.  I am not sure why people complain.  I have always found the clerks and the manager to be extremely helpful.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This is my second review of the post office or postal delivery people from this office. My first review was concerning how my mail was not being delivered because my dogs who are behind a double locked welded door scared the delivery woman. She stated that my dogs were out and letters were also sent to animal control. This week my neighbor told me she said she will pass my house because the dog next door scares her. He stands up on the fence and looks over. So what am I suppose to do? I moved my mailbox once for the lady and not doing it again! No mail again today!<//text>

I have two dog, a small boxer and a 10 year old spaniel mix, in house dogs 90 % of the time. They, like most dogs like to bark and jump on the welded metal security door when the mail person makes it to the front porch (mail box at door). I make sure door is doubled locked, but the woman insist that my dogs can get out. They have never gotten out, I hardly believe they could break through a welded metal security door.  The post office has blessed me with 2 orders of restraint that were also sent to animal control   Mind you the order says my dogs were out and unrestrained. Never have they been out. I talked to the mail lady about passing my house and she says she has the right to not deliver. Went to the post office and talked to a very nice lady in charge. She felt there was not reason for her not to deliver, given what I had said. She suggested she might have to come to my house and check the door for herself. I said not problem, just make sure you have plenty of time to go with me as we check everyone's wood fences, gates, doors and such that have doors. She was a "no show". Few weeks went by and we are now getting another notice that states screen doors and such are not considered proper restraint. WTH? My dogs are much more secure than dogs behind fences. Today I have mail going out and the postman walks right past my house...I am so done!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Use this post office for a po box if you want everyone else's mail but your own. I also love half the envelopes getting ripped up in the sorting machines constantly. Call if you want no answer. What's cool is your tax dollars are going towards this and nobody can get fired or dealt with. Work there if you want triple the paycheck of everybody else, but only come in half the time.</Review>

Worst usps I've ever dealt with. Constantly giving my mail to the wrong address, constantly lying about delivery attempts. Going to the offices is not bad. Their face to face customer service is ok. Although, why do I have to go to the office to make them function properly?</text>

If there was a Zero star I would have to give it them.  Apparently, do to a shortage of staffing they can not keep their passport hours.  Do they answer the phone so we can ask a question? No  Do they change there hours on the website? No. Do they even bother to put up a sign?  No.  It's pretty much your  just out of luck kind of an attitude.  Government at it's finest.<//Review>

Absolutely the worst post office I have ever stepped foot in. I read the reviews before I had mail sent here as general delivery bit I thought how bad could it be! It is terrible. Rude is right and just outright unprofessional.  That seems to be the norm in Clovis California so they fit right in. If your not from Clovis and you dont have to absolutely deal with this posts office I would stay clear of this place the reviews are correct.</text>

<Text>stopped delivering my packages for no reason, just "undeliverable as addressed". Called the USPS 800 number and the lady was very helpful. She said it was the carrier, that for whatever reason he was not delivering, but said he had no good reason and that I needed to call Clovis branch and speak to a manager. I have called several times and they wont answer their phone. This is ridiculous. No wonder the post office is going out of business. Next time I have a choice I will use Fedex.</Text>< date>

<text>I lost my PO box key and asked about paying for a replacement. They said I would have to wait 6 weeks until the person who does that came back to work. Then after that I went and paid my $9 and was told that it would take another few weeks for key to come because it comes from Washington DC. Stupid I know. Well it is now 4 months later and it still hasn't come. I asked a month ago and they said to keep waiting.

<text>Used to drop of packages daily. When busy staff tends to be overly non caring. It appears USPS policy for letters is to not stamp the envelopes, but to hand to customer the stamps and that's it. The counter personal is often a waste of time abd I dreadded having international postings as going to the counter was required.</text><Name>Lloyd Loomis< /Name><time>1518216951567< /time></record>

Extremely rude. My care package to my husband was returned for a mistake on their end and the people who assisted me were extremely rude & unprofessional. The lady was Joji and the manger was a bald chubby guy.< /Review>

<Review>Placed call during business hours phone never answered.  Does anyone at post office in Clovis care about the public's opinion of their service?

Used the USPS KIOSK @ CLOVIS CA on 5/4/2018 about 9:15PM.  It billed my debit card but failed to print postage or a receipt.   Thankfully it was only a $1.00, I really hate machines.....  1star is for the KIOSK, otherwise this Post Office does okay...</text>

<Text>They were working on a whole island of gas pumps here. The gas here is a little higher than other places I have been to. The store offers very basic convenience items but has plenty of liquor for sale. The store inside is some what cluttered with the way their merchandise is displayed. The cashier tried to be personable but was a million miles away, in her head. She like the store she works for had a lot going on.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Been going here for years! I like the fact that they open so early. As I I can make emergency runs. Sometimes some of the food items can be stale but not excessively pricey. Good place to get gas. The workers are always friendly and are fun to joke with. Especially Alicia.< /review>

<text>For the most part i had good experiences coming here. Then i was accused of stealing. I was looking at candy one day with my cousin, and we were deciding what to get for a trip to the movies, and the guy who owns the place came out and accused of stealing. I did nothing wrong, he later apologized, however i have not went back there since.</text><name>Brandon M<//name>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>When I’m in the area I often stop for my favorite cup of latte, the horchata. It’s a perfect craft, not to sweet nor bitter. You can order warm or cold but still on point. You really can’t go wrong with any of their items on the menu.

Their customer services is great. I always get greeted at the door and make sure my drink is to my taste. Good vibes!</text>< Pics>

I came across this place while perusing Magnolia Boulevard. It is a tiny, adorable coffee shop. I tried the iced Mexican mocha with oatmilk and my fiance got an iced chai. The drinks were delicious! I was also really glad to see the staff actively enforcing safety guidelines. The store is very small, but it was a little busy when I decided to go. The staff enforced a strict limit on people inside and made people wait outside.</Text>

<review>When ordering my coffee on New Year’s Day, I was quite taken aback by the very casual and nonchalant inquiry I received in which the white barista and her white coworker asked me if I wanted my coffee with enough milk to “look like JLo or Denzel?” Last time I checked white people comparing beverages/food to POC’s melanin was not....encouraged? In a place of business or otherwise? Will not be giving my business here again ☺️<//review><UserId.>111102889211030421718</UserId.>< user_name>

Staff is always friendly and always up for a chill convo! Drinks always taste great. Sometimes it'll be busy, but there are sweet spot times where there are 1 to few people waiting for coffee. Usually take my pup and there is water waiting for her outside.< /Review>

This spot was a go to of mine but not anymore. Recently the service has been off and I've just witnessed unsanitary practices. From touching your face, having the phone out on the counter while making drinks, touching the inside of cups to not properly washing their hands.<//Review>

You can literally taste the difference. I come here at least once a week. Definitely appreciate that they take great care when making your coffee yet are still fast and efficient. Try the horchata iced latte!</text>

This place is hit and miss depending on the day you go. Been a few times now. Some days the drinks and service are really solid and other days it's okay to not-so-great. If you find your day stick with it.<//text>

<Text>Blvd Cafecito is a wonderful little coffee shop in Burbank. The coffee is delicious. They serve basic coffees as well as unique blends and creations. The price is reasonable. The service is very good. Seating is a bit tough as only a few tables inside and outside. Highly recommend trying if in the area!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2957ef1c70cd9:0xbc8ca3d34f0962ba< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Blvd Cafecito is a wonderful little coffee shop in Burbank. The coffee is delicious. They serve basic coffees as well as unique blends and creations. The price is reasonable. The service is very good. Seating is a bit tough as only a few tables inside and outside. Highly recommend trying if in the area!</text>< Pictures>

Overpriced coffee, yet I usually support small businesses. I particularly stop here because it's the only place to get a colada that I know.

"Pero," after the interaction I just had with a staff member, I won't be coming back because I don't spend my money where colorism and discrimination happen.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I write for a music and coffee blog called Crooners In Coffeeshops, in which I interview local musicians at local coffeeshops. My writeup reflects the positive experience that I encountered at Blvd Cafecito on our interview date.

Oh Burbank, how you always provide a new reason to come back to visit from Porto’s to thrift stores. This time, you’ve got us never wanting to leave with Cuban Inspired coffeeshop Blvd Cafecito. While tiny in stature, you’re going to feel like you stepped into a cozy hipster’s paradise with a fun interior design comprised of wooden paneled walls, witty artwork lining the shelves, tiny succulents, and a typewriter as the cherry on top of the cake. Added bonus, they play awesome alt-rock music in the background and their baristas make you want to be besties with them, so why would you not want to pop on by?

They got a great selection of classic caffeinated beverages with additions of Latin recipes like the Mexican Mocha and the Horchata Latte. But the highlight of the menu has to be their Cuban specialties, which is comprised of the Cortadito, the Colada, the Cafe Cubano, and the Cafe Con Leche. Pair one of these bad boys with a yummy pastry displayed on one of their cake stands and you’ve got yourself a reason to never leave. Or at least a great food and drink combo to hit up all of the the cool shops on the strip.< /Text>< pictures>

Great coffee. I love, love this place!!  I try to get here as much as I can.
They have all milk substitutes as well. The workers are great and helpful with your needs.
Small, quaint place.
I took my mom here for the first time and she LOVED the coffee and she's not much of a coffee drinker.</review>

Great little place for great coffee. My fave is their Cafe con Leche. With Oat Milk. Have also tried their Horchata Latte. Yummy and not overly sweet. Their seasonal Honey Lavender Latte is very good too. Friendly service!</Text>

I got a regular vanilla latte, it was great, yummy and strong just like I like it, my bf got the horchata latte and it was delicious! It really was something special, my son got the hot chocolate with vanilla cream to make a leaf with, he loved it and said it was the best hot chocolate he ever had! I was told this cafe carries gluten free vegan brownies, which is awesome because my little one has a gluten and egg allergy, unfortunately they were out but it’s just awesome that they have the option, I hope to find some next time we come! Cute coffee paintings, cute cafe, period!<//review>

<review>Warm and friendly staff/baristas. There is no pretentiousness in the air here. Their iced mocha was great, pretty sweet... But that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I received a nice run thru if their pastry options and landed on their scone. Might be the best scone I've ever had! I recommend stopping by this little hole in the wall. It's easy to miss, so slow down and watch for it.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2957ef1c70cd9:0xbc8ca3d34f0962ba< /gmap_id><response>None< /response><username>Brad Schaider< /username><Time>1527466483966< /Time><rate>5</rate></record></dataset><record>

Best bold coffee in Burbank. A neighborhood treasured meeting spot. Only thing missing is poncho Sanchez and Cuban breakfast burrito club.</text>

< review>
I have been here a few times on the weekends and I LOVE this place. The Cafe con Leche is made with time and care which much appreciated when anywhere else things are served with such a rush. The baked goods  are all delicious and fresh and are made by local bakeries.  It is small and cozy and if you dont want to sit and hang out, the Magnolia Park area is perfect for strolling and enjoying window shopping at the nearby businesses.< /review>

There are other pastries and nibbles to go with your ideal cup of coffee.  If you like good strong coffee, this is the place to go!  There are several other neighborhood shops right there as well if you want to browse while enjoying your Java.</review></record></dataset><record>

As a lover of good coffee, let me tell you Cafecito Rocks!  I've been to other coffee houses and their coffees are good, but Cafecito's coffee is excellent. I had their hot latte,  it was strong, foamy and delicious.  The baristas go out of their way to offer you choices and recommendations.  Go and have some coffee  here, you'll not regret it.< /text>

<UserId.>115555098240971175549< /UserId.><text>I really like this place alot and I come here often when I'm in Burbank. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of the female barista. She's tall, thin, brunette shoulder length wavy hair and wears glasses. This is the 4th time shes helped me and always has an excuse on why she cant make me my drink the way I ask for it. I usually order a blended drink and the guy barista always makes it for me when he is on duty. but the times I've stopped in there and the girl barista is there, like I said she always has an excuse on why she cant make me a blended drink. Is she lazy? I do love supporting local businesses but with people like her working its difficult to support a business. I will still continue coming here but whenever she is working there I will not be supporting.</text></record></dataset><record>

The owner would rather people get their coffee from Starbucks. At least that is what I heard him tell a customer. Oblige him.</Text>

You’ve done well today. I was through the outside pharmacy line in 15 minutes with two cars ahead of me! Keep up the good work and you may change your reputation!!!! Just a tip: eye contact is nice when you talk to people...at times I heard you talking but had no clue you were talking to me because you weren’t looking at me.</Text>

I want to like this pharmacy, with the drive through for convenience, but it is so slow. Some of the staff are pleasant. Others not so much. They put you on hold without a word and never get back to you. Prescriptions wait for days to be filled. No explanation. No one should have to call every day for 6 days to get a legitimate, regular scrip refilled. Set up appointment for flu shot, waited 30 minutes. Set up appointment for shingles shot, waited 40 minutes only to be told they couldn’t get the computer to work. Said they would get back to me to reschedule. That was three months ago. They are understaffed. Apparently corporate doesn’t care.< /Text>

Totally filthy. Dirty toilet paper scattered around the entrance of the store and absolute disregard to health and safety in the store. Flies all over the place too and a nauseating stink throughout the store. Disgusting. Additionally very slow service.<//Text>

This place is incredibly slow. Plan on waiting a minimum of 45 minutes. Also, you may be risking your life just going to this place the parking lot is always of crack heads and homeless people. I have seen drug deals go down in front of the front door while waiting for somebody inside. Walgreens needs to close this place down just to save their own image.</Review>

<Review>Walgreens lost a long time customer. Stopped by on Sunday to pickup prescription, was told to come back and it would be ready. I come back only to find out they "don't have the medicine and I should call other Walgreens locations to see if they have it." At this point, why trust Walgreens word they have it somewhere else? I can show up there also only to be blown off. I'll never go back.</Review>< Pictures>

They will say they are transferring you to speak with some and after waiting you will hear the line be picked up and then immediately put back on hold numerous times until they inevitably end the call. When you call back they are rude and unhelpful. It's been 4hours since my prescription was called in and they still haven't completeled it.

I completely understand that there are sick patients who need services more urgently than I, but there has not been a single time I have waited less than 35 minutes to just pick up a prescription.
And the drive-thru line is just insane. I waited almost an hour and one of the pharmacists just kept coming to say “one more minute.”
Not sure why exactly this store isn’t able to get it together like most other Walgreens stores, but it should definitely be evaluated.
I’ve never seen more angry customers.< /text>

The employees over here are rude, lazy and disrespectful. Im not saying all of them are, but the majority for the most part. I went in on 2 seperate occassions to print some pictures, and no one even acknowledged me yet alone, tried to help me.  Even after i asked. I understand the practice of social distancing, but by the way some of these employee treat customers, the employees should really just stay at home. ill never go here again.<//text>

Worst pharmacy ever!!!! My doctor sent the script for 3 medications 2 times because they said they didnt get it! Then my doctor just called them on the phone and when I called Walgreens back they said they got the prescription and that all 3 would be ready by 12:30pm. My husband took his lunch so he could go get the prescriptions and they said we dont have one of those prescriptions here at all (NEVER MENTIONED ON THE PHONE). Then, even after checking my pharmacy providers through my insurance which confirmed they do take my insurance, the pharmacist said no actually we dont take your insurance and tried to tell my husband that a prescription of ibuprofen would come to $60. DO NOT GO HERE. WORST PHARMACY I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH.< /Review>

I like the music this walgreens played. Every single song is so good.
And I really appreciate all the staff here, especially Daniel a Mexican, to let me stay tonight when I could not find any place to sleep.

This Walgreens has rude service and they never have the shelves stocked. This is THE WORST pharmacy. The line is always 5 people deep and they only have one person available to help. I get confirmations (calls/texts/emails) that my prescription is ready and when I get there they say don't have it. So I have to come back yet again to stand in line for 20 minutes the next day and hope it was filled. This place is completely unorganized and poorly managed.< /Review>

Charles at the Pharmacy was flat out rude. He made fun of my name the first time I decided to get my medication from Walgreens. The next time I go, he gives me a hard time for using the drive up window. To think I even gave them a second shot was just not right. I sent my persecription to CVS down the street and don’t plan on ever going here again. Don’t waste your time going to this Walgreens, it will just make you feel worse than you did before.< /text>

<review>Something needs to be done about the pharmacy drive-thru. To let a car sit at the window for 20 minutes or more backs up their line and makes customers wait for a very long time to get to the front. I waited in line for 45 minutes earlier today and didn't make it to third up before my children lost it and I had to leave. My husband is currently in line and has been for an hour. He's two behind the window. Some changes need to be made to make the line more efficient. I'm sure this is something they hear quite often. It's the only Walgreens in town and I will be changing pharmacies after this evening.<//review><name>Carmela Bodenstein</name>< UserId.>

<review>Nothing against the workers, they have always been great (so I'll give 2 stars instead of 1), but I've never been able to get a prescription filled in a timely manner. I think they must be understaffed.

Just tonight it took almost 3 hours to get a basic prescription for Amoxicillin filled for my daughter with an ear infection.  It was the final straw (of several experiences) that caused me to write this review.

I hope you are able to get more staff in hand soon.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Gmap_id>0x808de4fc2a88626d:0xa45e2a2973de1ca2</Gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><Name>Matt C</Name><Time>1487564650143</Time></record></dataset><record>

Yes Im the 3rd car in line right now and have been here over an hour the line has not moved once. This is a sad excuse for a pharmacy! I even had my husband go inside and there are 9 people in line. 5 people behind the counter and only 2 are helping customers. Nobody has even acknowledged the window. I am going to find the number to corporate and report this location. And this happens EVERY time you come to this location!

I am pregnant and have been taking an antidepressant for probably 6 months now and every single time I go to pick up my refill (which they have to call and confirm with my OBGYN), I am made to feel like a drug addict. They ask me every time if I am pregnant and then I have to wait extra time for the pharmacist to come and talk to me. They act like they are giving me opioids during pregnancy which what I’m taking is actually the safest antidepressant during pregnancy. I get this refill every few weeks and it’s always the same song and dance. Yesterday my prescription was filled, they had already contacted the doctor, and the pharmacist still refused to give me my medication until they spoke with my doctor on the phone to “make sure everything was ok”. I am now in the process of having my doctor just send a new prescription to a new pharmacy because I’m tired of being harassed every time I try to pick up medication. Ridiculous. And I still don’t have medication that I am out of.

Horrible store! Terrible customer service... Cashier Usha and Manager Joe should be FIRED immediately - can you believe this - they won't let customers use the restroom after 9pm despite being open 24 hours. Here in this tourist central location?? Wow... Anyway there's a Safeway right across the street - go there instead! Absolutely criminal treatment of customers.< /Text>

Called in my prescription refill. Was not notified until I tried to pick it up that I can't get it refilled. Now I'm out if meds. Terrible service.  Waited over 20 minutes in line. Can't get my meds. Hate this place.< /Text>

I just spent 22 minutes trying to get a prescription transferred to this store. I spent 20 of the minutes on hold. When I called back to speak to a manager, I was put on hold for so long, the call was redirected.

To be fair, everyone was courteous, when I was able to speak with actual people. When I have shopped here, I haven't had any complaints. But I can't use the pharmacy if no one will help me. Goodbye, Walgreens.< /review>

TERRIBLE customer service. Needed an over the counter pain reliever that is carried at every other Walgreens I've been to, but they didn't carry the product and it took 20 minutes of chasing people around and waiting in line to figure that out.<//text>

Getting a hold of anyone in the Pharmacy via phone is difficult. I've called three time son one day to speak to a Pharmacist and instead was placed on hold by automated service for 40-60 minutes each time before hanging up because no one picked up my call. I then called again first thing in the morning to see if maybe it was the time of day that I was calling and still no one ever picked up the phone... held on the line for 45 minutes before hanging up. What happened to Customer Service? Why do you not answer your calls? Very bad customer service...<//review>

I had to step over transients with a German Shepard barking at me. When I alerted the manager, Caroline, she went out and talked to them. As I left they threatened me as she stood there with them. Are they her friends she is allowing to live outside the store?<//Text>

<Review>The worst pharmacy in town. The wait is 45 minutes on average or longer. The treatment of customers is non professional. If your prescription is not ready, be prepared to hear cooked up explanations about your coverage or insurance by the pharmacy manager.

Just take your business somewhere else.<//Review>< Pics>

Open 24 hours. Night staff is friendly, even with desperate people on the wee hours of the morning. At times this store is way under staffed, but the staff that are there have tried to make up for it.</Review>

<Text>Is there anything better at 2 o'clock than stopping by Sonic and getting something cold to drink? It's my stop to get a Soda or other drink and then munch on the ice.

05/31/21 Edit; Pulled up and hit the red button in the screen. Nothing like waiting for 10 minutes and still no response even when the screen tell you that the red button was hit and someone will be with you momentarily. Momentarily to me I'd a couple of minutes, not 10. I left longing for that Cherry Limeade that would have gone great with my Lemon Vodka. I'm still hotter than Fish grease. (Mad)<//Text>< pics>

Honestly  Has to be one of my favourites as far as quick fast foodie- type establishments.  Great for slushies, shakes, malts, or if you're just in need of a fast "sweet tooth" killer.< /text>

I love their #shakes and #slushies, so good. The food always taste fresh, food always comes out fast, and I really appreciate when they roll out on skates I think it's so cool and nostalgic, glad some decide to do that. They also have a drive thru if your not into the drive up park and order either way service is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Review>

The soft serve ice cream has weird chunks here.  The manager was very nice and said the reason why is because they don't use the ice-cream machine enough so the ice cream comes out chunky.  I didn't like the consistency of chunky ice cream at this location but the Manager was nice enough to refund me.</Text>

solid fast food and ideal now because you pull up and dine in your car.

service is fast and accurate and always friendly.

i can’t give five stars for food but i can’t do that for any fast food.< /review>

<text>The shakes at Sonics are amazing to say the least. If you are going by you should definitely check out their peanut butter shake, as it may change your life. The service was okay and the whip cream was a little thick. Sonics is always a place that we like to stop when we get the chance because it's a great snack for the kids and all that thick liquid keeps them busy trying to drink it all. Busy kids are quiet kids which is why we love Sonic.<//text>< rate>

<text>Pretty good service and friendly servers. Food is good but not representative of how great sonic is in the south. Its just so so here. But half price drinks is always worth the drive here. Don't forget to tip the servers!! Regardless of the.

The grilled cheese sandwiches to die for the lemonade slush is a bang on the tongue but it’s well worth it pretzels dominate but with the chicken meal you only get one onion ring kind of weird but we’re still super happy with sonic would love it</Review>

Hadn't tried Sonic before. It wasn't that good. Their meat didn't really taste like hamburger or something? Their slush was good. The fries were soggy. Tried it. Didn't like it.<//Review>

Love their food and shakes!!! But after having some difficulties trying to get my order across correctly when I received my order my shake was wrong. And after all the trouble I had already gone through I gave up and just left without trying to get the issue fixed. So I took 2 stars for that but I totally give the food a full 5 stars 🌟<//Review>

<text>This Sonic location RARELY messes up on my orders and I come here often. This location is further from me than the Santa Ana location on Fairview and MacArthur. I choose to drive all the way over here because the other location has messed up my orders many, many times.

This location is also less busier than the other location and has nicer employees.< /text>< Response>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>Sonic has more variety than most fast food places, and they've tried to capture, to some extent, the nostalgic feeling some of us old-timers remember from the drive-ins we used to go to. The high-tech ordering stations flanking each parking space can be intimidating the first time you try to use them, however.  For those who have less time on their hands, they also offer drive-thru service. Their prices are pretty reasonable, as fast food goes.  But a "famous root beer stand" they are not.< /Text><response>None< /response><user_name>Gary Young</user_name>< Date>

< Review>
Can't explain it, but all Sonic's milkshakes are above all others. Who knew the hot fudge hand-churned milkshake it's different than a chocolate milkshake. Strawberry is fresh tasting &  vanilla's are delicious. Perfect consistency; a dense milkshake so it's not sloppy. Sonic is open after 10 p.m. on Friday nights it's a win-win.<//Review>

This Sonic has great customer service, never had any issues. Been going here for a few years now. The app is great for ordering ahead of time and getting some really nice deals, which got me to start eating here when I drive by. And they have an in-house made lemonade, thats an extra star in my book since I am not too keen on drinking corn syrup based fountain drinks anymore.<//Text>

This place is wild. The first time I ate here they made my sandwich 4 times. The manager did apologize and gave me a free meal. Fast forward to a month ago I tried it again and they made my food completely wrong. I had to drive back, the manager was very nice about it. TODAY my grandma ordered a chili cheese burger with onions. They brought it out with no onions, so they brought her out some when she asked. After realized there was no hamburger patty. It was just chili, cheese, and bread. She sent it back and they remade it saying they had no idea that she wanted a hamburger patty. I’ve tried so hard to let this place redeem itself but it’s like they want to mess up your food 🤦🏼‍♀️</text>

Although quite busy, they still outshined in their service & in the food prep.  They even gave us napkins, unlike the one on MacArthur Fairview!
This one’ll be our go-to from now on, I tell you.</text>

After cruising down to the beach in my Corvette, my brother and I stopped in at Sonic Drive-In on Harbor Blvd. It was late so I had a breakfast sandwich with eggs and bacon in between toasted bread ! DEE LISH ! Next time I want to try the BBLT Sandwich - which I saw in their video screens ....that sandwich looks like another DEE LISH !<//Text>

Overall, the food was quite well for being a fast food joint! It was my aunt and uncles first time being there, so it was a lot of fun for them too. I definitely recommend this place because the food is great but so are the shakes. Don't forget, the shakes are half off after 8 pm!<//Text>

Large drink selection!! Happy hour from 2-5pm for half off drinks and 99- cent corn dogs. The tater tots are always good. The pretzel twists are good too. They have a sweet, cinnamon one with a icing dipping sauce. They also have a salty one that you can get cheese sauce with. Service is friendly and they try to be as quick as possible.< /review>

Classic Sonic one of those American places that I always hope is around. It's a great location got lots of choices you can have and the service is really good.
Especially if you like to eat in your car and they have outside seating too.
Great location close to other things that you can do as well.< /review>

Exceptional eatery for after hours Half Priced Milk shakes, made with real Ice Cream.
Also the serving staff employees and led by Mr. Paul the cashier attitude is really a blessing to the fast food industry,because us consumers trust those who prepare our desired foods and drinks....Keep up the good work Sonic Employees......The Counselor< /text>

Slowest Sonic ever.  Literally waited over 20 minutes to be serviced.  If your name is Sonic, the one thing you can't be is slow.  Epic fail.<//Review>

<review>I ordered 2 sprites, a chicago dog and a chili cheese dog and popcorn chicken.  "by itself, not a meal" and these geniuses bring 2 PLAIN hotdogs!  The exact same empty naked dog with 2 different prices! (chicago vs. Chili cheese).  I asked for a manager and there wasn't anyone over 18.
Just give me my money back.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Sorry, this was the first time at this location in years. We pulled in, pushed the button,  and waited. And waited. And waited. Pushed the button 3 more times.  Nothing. Not a "We'll be right with you", not a "Sorry for the wait, we're really busy", not a "We appreciate your patience". Nothing. We sat there for 10 minutes,  and finally left.<//text>< Date>

Shakes were too watery. The whipped cream was thicker than the shake. Most nights they are not but I have had watery shakes often here.  Oh and the shake had a drop of whipped cream this time.< /Review>

If you are in a hurry or on your lunch hour, be warned about going to this Sonic location.  I don't know what the problem is with their drive-thru, but it is horrible.  When I pulled up they asked me to wait a moment. I did and they NEVER came back in over 10 minutes. Two cars behind me left.  I was so curious as to how long it would take them to ever respond that I timed it and was also saying, "Hello", but no one ever responded.  I finally drove toward the window where there was only one car ahead of me, and they were leaving as I pulled forward.  I told the person at the window that no one ever came back on the line to take my order.  No apologies or any kind of explanation.  I didn't expect one though because this has happened more than once, but I usually just leave.  My order was then $12 and change. I gave them a $20 and they gave me the amount of my order back, so we had to fix that.  I don't even know how this location is surviving with this type of service, or actually lack of service.  Too bad.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Slow service! Not that busy. The employees don't know where order went. Messed up my order! Hate to think how it would be if they were busy.

My cheese burger had one piece of cheese. Taste like the soy burger back in school.</text>

<text>When I go to Sonic I usually get their regular burger always awesome and of course "tater tots" .  You have to try the tater tots. The foot-long chili dog is always good too. I don't think I've tried anything on their menu I did not like.  And of course I love the drive-in & Park atmosphere so like an episode of Happy Days.< /text><UserId.>115273176773715311853< /UserId.><Date>1530402506261< /Date><Rating>4< /Rating><gmapID>0x80dcdf596521aa3d:0x3a7af69dd84f3872</gmapID>< response>

Sonic is great, I like the food and quick service. Sometimes they forget to give me ranch or ketchup but it's not the end of the world. They're always friendly and polite. If I could change anything, they used to offer to put a sour syrup in their slushies but don't anymore, I'm bummed! But I still enjoy going there!</review>

Great service! Food came quickly and accurately. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it wasn't the best burger I've had but it was pretty good. The shakes and frozen custard are awesome!< /text>

This was my first experience at Sonic. I'm from Los Angeles and now in Orange County and we don't have them out there! prices extremely reasonable and I love the curbside service! had a big cheeseburger with onion rings and it was only $2.39 and was absolutely delicious! highly recommend this place</Review>

< Review>
The good is that the desserts here are second to none for a fast food place (okay, maybe them and DQ are neck-and-neck in that department, but still!) and the menu items generally can do no wrong.  The bad is that there are times where the speed of service is absolutely ridiculously slow.  Best to patronize this spot during non-peak hours or late night, lest you get caught in the rush yourself.<//Review>

< Review>
This is the only location that decides to close their drive up order boards when ever they want. I come here ever Sunday night at 830pm and they close everything but the drive through before 9pm (4 times in a row so far) and the drive through is 10-15 cars. Don't go here, go to another friendlier location.<//Review>

<Review>The food is not very good. It's ok. The worst thing about this place, though, is that there's one person doing all of the non-cooking work. One. For a place with 30 or 40 spots to pull in and be served! It took the guy next to us 12 minutes to get a corndog lol.<//Review>< pictures>

I gave 5 stars not because of the overcooked food, but for there efforts on trying to bring back that 1950's feel. And for that it's worth 5 stars.< /review>

Got into a stall only to be told that they were only accepting orders through the drive thru. My cookie bit and banana shake had peanut butter (I'm allergic so that went great) and my Strawberry-Banana shale had wadded up straw sleeves pushed inside it. Very yummy.</review>

Sonic is always a good late night stop. If you have time and don't need to be anywhere soon, pull into the parking spot and order/eat in the car. If you're on the move and can deal with a 5 minute wait then go for the drive thru. Be aware, on busy nights when the staff coverage isn't the best the wait can be exceedingly long, but this has only happened once for me. Great place, great food, fun to partake in. Bring skates back!< /review>

<Text>i went to this Sonic on my lunch break (3:51pm PST on 6/5/2019) and decided to go thru the drive thru. When I arrived the person taking my order said "give me just one minute and I will be able to assist you". So I waited and never moved from the original spot I pulled up in. After waiting for over 5-8 minutes and saying hello to the talk box a couple times I decided to pull to the window. Once I pulled to the window the same young lady stated she heard the sensor cancel and thought I didn't want to order anymore (even though there were cars behind me also and they have cameras on the drive thru). She stated if you want to pull up to a booth we can help you now but we cannot help you at this window. by then it was too late for me to order and I had to return to work. Terrible experience that left me hungry.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dcdf596521aa3d:0x3a7af69dd84f3872</gmapID></record>

<text>The workers never faulter, they always get my order right. They also ask me if I want addtional  condiments too, something that a lot of fast food places don't do anymore. and they are also quick especially if I'm on a time crunch and there's a long line. Makes it easier to choose where to eat around this area that has a lot of choices<//text>< time>

The food is great. Be sure to check times for walk up window and drive thru so you're not sitting in front of a speaker waiting for someone to take your order and they're closed. Otherwise, great food, good prices.<//text>

Good slushes but slow as hell. Waited 20 minutes for a slush before driving if without it. Would be different if busy but there were only a couple of people there at the time. Will not be returning ever again.</Review>

My Asiago chicken sandwich come with a piece of hair in it. Able to swap out for another sandwich but that feeling doesn't go away. Probably will never come back to it. They don't have a big straw for their milkshake which is really thick and with bit of m&m. Really management?<//review>

Great and fast service at this location, the one in Huntington Beach however... good luck with that one lol.  When I arrived at the Huntington Beach location which is newer I pressed the button to get served waited 10 mins and the server came out and said... sorry for the wait here is your order... I was like wait... what? Apparently the people before me waited so long they paid for food and just left... not wanting to be put in that same situation I left as well shortly after with still no response to the button pressed after a subsequent 5 minute wait ... you can bet I will be leaving a bad review at that location later, in contrast this location was super fast and nice service .  Just come here if you want sonic</text>

Will never go there again. Half hour wait with only a couple of other cars there. (Ten minutes of that was "our car hop is on the way".) Then the screen returned to opening start menu. Food *never* arrived. Not even a sighting of a car hip wandering aimlessly. Too bad, we were really looking forward to it.<//review>

Came back to this place after a terrible experience where I waited 20+ minutes for nothing last year, thinking it would be better.
Stood there waiting for my order to be taken for 7 minutes, only to be told to "hold on one moment please" and then had the thing hangup on me.
What a disappointment.</Text>

It was past 8 pm. All shakes half off. My receipt says 815 pm.  Still got charged full price.  Good shake but why do false advertising.< /review>

I saw that the drive thru was super long. So I decided to park instead. Maybe it would go quicker. Wrong. I waited my whole 30mins. Before pressing the button again to ask when my food and drinks would be ready. The lady who didn't give me her name. Said it would be another 15-20min wait. I couldn't wait any longer at that point. I needed to get back to work. So I asked for a refund because I had already paid for food that I never received. Well anyways the lady told me that if I couldn't wait. It was ok to leave and my money would be refunded at the end of the night. It's been almost a week later. Nothing has been refunded.

Will never go there again. Half hour wait with only a couple of other cars there. (Ten minutes of that was "our car hop is on the way".) Then the screen returned to opening start menu. Food *never* arrived. Not even a sighting of a car hip wandering aimlessly. Too bad, we were really looking forward to it.< /Review>

The last time I went here, I waited 10 minutes and there was no sign of my order. I pressed the call button to check on my order and they said it was coming. After another 10 minutes, I called again and said it had been over 20 minutes, and I wanted to know if they were ever going to bring out my order. They then told me that they accidentally sent our order to the drive through window and didn't know where it was supposed to go. They finally brought my order out and the manager had removed the charges for all of the food, and only charged me for the drinks. A little bit of a frustrating experience, but at least they owned up to the mistake and didn't charge me for the food.<//Review>

Sonic's is great.  I'm not sure about other locations, but this has a happy hour for drinks after 3 or 4pm, and before 7pm I believe.  Cherry Limeade is the best.

Burgers are ok, and they also have TOTS. Can't beat it.<//Review>

Felt like I was eating air. I don't know how to explain it. Just seemed so light for such a big price. I got the #4 burger toaster. There was no love put into the sandwich. An the fries were so mis portioned. And the onion rings were like so flimsy and thin. It was just a huge disappointment :/ and ocean water is just sprite soda colored blue and had to pay 10 cents more. Ha! It was just nice that for once they had a skater person come deliever the food this time..Austin was a nice guy.</Text>

Drive-thru is a little slow and not always accurate on large orders. We love their tater tots and slushes, perfect for hot summer days.</Text>

On a road trip.  Promised my kids icecream.  We waited over a half an hour with lots of more miles to cover.  I spoke with three different employees. Very disappointed with the way we watched almost 20 customers get their service.  It feels like our order didn't matter at all.  Arrived at 8:55.  Typing this review at 9:40. Still no icecream! We drive hours to get to this point.  Heck I would be a good deal closer to camp if we avoided this place. 9:50 Manager came out and took my order personally.< /Text>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>Pretty good. I enjoy the fact that it's a drive-in. We ordered some flavored teas (like all the options, wish you could get some flavors Splenda-free) and played our 3DSs. Got hungry, ordered breakfast burritos because they are so delicious, but they were outta eggs. :( First time that had happened. Got chicken sandwiches and Jalapeno Ched 'R Poppers, which were a little too greasy but overall pretty good. Refilled our teas. Thought it was neat when you got your refill they'd do a different flavor for you. Hung out a half hour until close, was going to order dessert but the voice in the box said we had to drive-through at that point. Get the small dessert, always.</Text>< pictures>

The worst Sonic I've ever been to. The cheddar peppers taste like soap and they were grossly under cooked.< /Review>

< review>
Past couple of times I felt very rushed,even tho I ask to give me a minute please.I can't see far so I have a hard time viewing the menu.When I decide to go to Sonic I never know what I want I just know I want Sonic. I visit the Costa Mesa location and I live in Stanton/Garden grove. So I do go out of my way when I visit Sonic... Bottom line lately drive thru customer service at night needs improvement.When at least good customer service is not important it sure does show it sticks out like a sore thumb.Then when I drive up to the window the crew is cracking up and looking at you making me feel there laughing at me for being a paying customer that has questions about the drinks that I'm intrusted in.I leave Sonic feeling rushed and end up ordering the same thing all the time because its the only one that i know.Dont park it cus all I want is a drink from now on if I do go back  I better know what I want or park it and order a drink. Was there tonight between 10-10: 30pm and my drink was not part of the 1/2 off special where as before they always have been.??? 😱< /review>

Terrible service, not the best of food. No restroom. Outdoor seating & sitting in your car is the place to eat. No indoors at all for customers, hard to talk to waiters about anything.<//Text>

The Worst blasts.. would order a large oreo blast then noticed it barely had any oreo in it so I bumped it up with an additional add extra oreo fee, to hopefully get the desired amount. This again barely had much oreo in this large blast, at the bottom theres always half vanilla only. Finally almost as a joke , order it with two additional orders of added oreo to the already oreo blast.. same thing.. Barely any. It is all almost comical except for a waste of time and $6.50. Never hitting up that place again, shocked I had to write becuase of how annoying it finally got.</Text>

<Date>1469163739664</Date><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>We drove there all the way from Lakewood , because my son loves their mozzerella sticks. When we got home and no cheese sticks in the bag. Called and spoke to the manager, Lucas, and he knew they forgot the order, apologized, and offered free cheese sticks the next time we come in. Well Lucas since you didn't take off the order we didnt get off our bill, they are not free, we paid for them!!!Told him how far we came, and I am not looking for a free meal, but atleast take off the sticks man. Poor manager training. No common sense. I guess its really my fault assuming they would give us what we ordered. Should of checked the bag. This is why we go to In & Out Burger🍔👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻😡 We will not come back to give you anymore of our buisness, and will tell others of our experience!!!!< /Text>< pics>

"Now that we're here,
It's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
All in the mistakes,
One life contained
They all finally start to go away
Now that we're here it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day, and I can forgive
And I'm not ashamed to be the person that I am today"</text>

I showed up more than a half hour before it stated they closed. They refused me service and yelled at me saying they were closed! Such rude service! I won't be coming back. I'll take McDonald's over that bull<//review>

45 min for a burger meal and chicken sandwich meal...and an additional 10 mins because they messed up the burger. All we got was sorry we're busy as they walk away. Cant even tell you to your face..never again.<//review>
