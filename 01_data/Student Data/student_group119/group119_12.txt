I loved the service! Both Adilene and Ashley were very professional and took care of all my concerns. They were so amazing I decided on the switch the very day. I now have my home and auto policies through State Farm and couldn’t be happier with their support. Thank you ladies for making this a painless transition and going above and beyond! Will definitely be referring friends/family and coming back for future needs :)</Text>

<text>We just moved back to Sacramento after living in Virginia for 8 months. Ashley Farfan was incredibly helpful in making this part of the move go smoothly. She was very responsive and we had everything taken care of in less than a day. Couldn’t ask for a smoother insurance experience.< /text>< Pics>

Adilene was one of the most professional and outstanding reps I have worked with in quite some time. She was there on a moments notice to do everything she could to get me very competitive quotes. If you're looking to get the best of both worlds with low rates and top notch customer service ask for her!<//text>

Ashley is always available and very thorough, she sends emails out to document everything and send them out immediately. Ashley calls you back as she says she well, and always completely covers everything and calls back to check that you have received what you needed, and if you have any additional questions.

This woman, Ashley , is a self-starter and very organized and I look forward to her getting all of her licenses completed someday and becoming a state farm actual insurance company agent that owns the agency.

Unfortunately we have had two different cars totaled in the family in the last six months and I have had lots of phone calls and support from the agency, making sure that we were able to get as much as a reimbursement for the value of the cars.
Ashley was able to track all of our paperwork with us, and make sure Peter our agent was able to follow up with us, regarding the settlement from State Farm

I have multiple policies and multiple family members who have policies with this office

We ensure seven cars total in our family, and have homeowners and umbrella policies. We even have banked with STATEFARM and had some other kind of investment with them

My other favorite agent in Peter’s office retired after decades with StateFarm, and it was wonderful that Ashley was there to take over all my business. I highly recommend the whole entire agency. It hasn’t mattered what state I’ve lived in, I have always had state farm</text>< Gmap_id>

I had heard good things from some coworkers, and honestly I was impressed. I worked with a young lady named Adilene Cisneros. Adilene was very knowledgeable and patient with me throughout the whole process. With her help, finding a policy that sufficiently covered me without breaking the bank every month was exactly what I was looking for - and I found it! Give these guys a shot, if you’re shopping. And if you can ask for Adilene - do that too!<//review>

Ashley listens to your needs and formulates an appropriate plan without trying to sell you on anything that isn't right for you. She has since kept in touch in regards to check ups and to let us know additional information about different types of insurance (car, etc.). When the incident that caused us to seek out State Farm insurance happened yet again, Ashley was there for us to resolve any issues with ease and compassion.

Ashley Farfan answered my call yesterday about adding our adult daughter to our homeowner's policy. Ashley was super-quick. I had the declarations pages sent via email, and I had them within minutes. Thank you, Ashley!< /Review>

I needed a reasonable quote for life insurance and after calling around the Sacramento area Ashley Farfan gave me the best prices. The unrivaled professionalism and patience she has makes Peter Schiro's agency the most pleasant. If you need anything, ask for Ashley Farfan!!<//text>

The agent named Nou was extremely helpful and made the process so easy. I had run a quote online for renters insurance and didn’t know what I was doing. She followed up with a call the next day and cleared up all of my confusion and signed me up! Very professional, quick to respond, and nice to work with.<//review>

Major kudos to Aaronisha Hicks! She was a tremendous help with a flood insurance policy premium issue. Not only did she assist with this year's policy payment but also resolved last year's premium overpayment. Aaronisha was diligent and provided great customer service! Many thanks to her and your company for employing her.</review>

<text>I have been with State Farm for years and have never filed a claim and pay my account on time every month.  Unfortunately,  every time I call  the Peter Schiro agency and ask for basic information such as  what is my deductible or I'd like  to add my new home to my account no one is ever able to help me in any sort of timely manner.  Monday I called and was promised Phyllis would call me back on Tuesday to go over my policy.  I am still waiting .... When I purchased my new home  I had to call several times  before getting a call back.  This is awful customer service.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1536775426058, 'text': 'Jim, please give my office a call so we can discuss this further and make it right for you. -Peter'}< /Resp><GmapID>0x809ad0ecce85b707:0xc1108861ffd80bc2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nice store...but a little overcrowded isles and it was tough to shop the clearance rack because it was jammed full and I felt like I was knocking stuff off the hangars.  I left.
I like the selection of clothes...but didnt find anything on this trip.  The clearance rack was my only dissapiontment!  Lol
The clerks here are very very nice!!</review>

Very nice employees and they always want to help you. If you don't know the size you should get you just tell them what size you usually get and they tell you what size it is in there sizes. Very good selection of clothes.< /text>

Went here to get some pants because they have good quality and wearablity. They were a bit busy as expected for a weekend. Everything was nice and in order and the ladies were very helpful. The only thing is that there were 3 to 4 ladies working and only 1 on the register. The other one was empty at the time. Im not sure if someone who was logged in was on break or what.  But the line got pretty long and the wait was getting long as well. One lady even complained to one of the other workers to jump on but she said she couldn't and apologized.  The girls here are always great and i love the store. Its pretty pricey but most of the items are durable and keep nice.<//text>

<review>I can't get enough of this store. The ladies are super nice and don't allow you to feel uncomfortable about yourself.  The clothes are a little more pricey but last for years never go out of style if you know how to dress.< /review>< Pics>

This store used to have cute cloths for the larger size woman.  I don't know whose been doing there shopping lately but there cloths suck and are not true to size.  However, there bra and panty set fits perfect and they actually carry my size as I am large busted.  Just wished they weren't so expensive.  Please,  get your act together when it comes to your cloths.  You have gone down hill in that area.<//Review>

<text>I placed an online order when I went into get my get my order it showed my jeans where are crossed out on order form. The lady proceed to tell me they were out in the Warehouse and that I wouldn't be charged for them. Then I got a receipt to my email showing that I picked the jeans up which I never got then I looked at my statement and I got charged for those jeans. so I called customer service and they said that the jeans were out at the warehouse but they had finally got them in and they were supposed to be put with my order... They were never put with my order and the lady told me they were sold out so not only did they charge me for the jeans they didn't put them in with my order and sold my jeans on their shelves. I did get my refund but it's besides the point they should have put my jeans in a separate bag and not sold them on the Shelf when they knew they were for an order. I just think if someone already purchased those jeans they should get first priority when they come in.. I'm really not happy.. I was really looking forward to those jeans...< /text><response>{'time': 1533903785715, 'text': 'vanessa barnes, we are so sorry to hear that you left our store feeling like anything other than the valued customer that you are.

Came in to return an item the store employee acted like it was an inconvenience for her to do my return my items she kept telling me not asking me if i wanted to extange my item i told her I'd look around and i did, didn't find anything i went back up to the counter and said I'd like a refund she still kept asking if i wanted and extange i had to tell her no more then 8x once she got the hint she was rude about it. The moment i walked in the store no greeting or anything.<//review>

<Time>1478680668711<//Time><Rating>1</Rating><text>This torrid is always very unprofessional. They never know what they are talking about when it comes to their company policies or rules and they do not have any customer service skills. Everyone who works here needs to be better taught. They should have to go watch the customer service provided at other torrids in the inland empire. I have been a loyal platinum member of torrid and I feel this store does not respect that nor treat any of their customers right. Its frustrating to deal with the workers and to be more knowledgeable than they are as just a customer. I have to tell them what they can do and they still deny it, then I prove it to them and they do not apologize for their mistakes or their negligence. I will like to take me complaint to corporate because it is not right to be a torrid insider who spends thousands of dollars and not to be treated right. They need to in my eyes all be reevaluated as torrid associates.<//text>< pics>

Seriously one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen and I've lived in LA and South Florida.

We went here to shoot the bioluminescence earlier this year. It was perfectly dark (we stayed away from the pier) and the pictures came out beautifully. There were stay at home orders in LA County but not in OC so it was great to take a breather. Parking was really easy because of COVID, everything around the beach was on shorter hours or closed so there was plenty of parking.</Text>

Clean beach, strong rip tide, life guards on duty. Everything that makes the ocean fun! Just don't let the kids wander too far into the surf bc the waves really sneak up on you sometimes! Paved walking paths take you down to about 25ft before the water too which was very helpful with hands full of coolers, chairs, and umbrellas!<//text>

<Review>The best place to live in southern California. Hands down. In the mornings, getting a cup of coffee and take a stroll on and around pier is the best way to start a day. Refreshing and rejuvenating.</Review>< GmapID>

<Text>Great gym, in a number of ways. The coaches are very experienced, the workouts are dynamic and fun without compromising intensity, and the community is fantastic. I started going to this gym about 4 months ago and I enjoy it now even more than when I first started.

Overall, the amazing experience I've had at this gym cannot be overstated. I would highly recommend checking out their website and signing up to meet with one of the coaches.<//Text>< pics>

I've been part of IFA since 2014.  The trainers provide a well-rounded program building strength, cardio, gymnastics, and flexibility into each workout.  The emphasis is on doing movements with good form and scaling the weight or movement is always an option with each workout.  The gym builds community and the owners and trainers encourage personal improvement for each athlete.   Great way to start each morning!<//Review>

I joined IronFire after moving to San Diego almost 3 years ago.  Having done crossfit in the past, in my neighbors garage, I felt I knew what to expect. However, the community of trainers and fellow athletes here far exceeded my expectations!  Not only do they cultivate a great peer community of support and friendly competition, but I've also learned MANY new techniques and hone countless others every week!  IronFire athletics is my fitness home, and I recommend them highly!< /text>

<review>Honestly I can't say enough good stuff about Ironfire. I have been there for 7 years now and I am so happy that I got so lucky with a great gym right off the bat. It is a perfect mixture of training, community, and fun! I have never looked so fit (ok well I still love ice cream) as now. I used to think I knew how to work out but I was sooooo wrong. Needless to say the trainers pay really close attention to detail so literally no one gets injured there. LOVE LOVE LOVE this gym!!!</review>< pics>

<date>1475811111216</date><rate>1<//rate><Review>So I try to drop in at CrossFit Poway, and when I was "greeted" I was asked if I could be helped as though I just took the jelly out of his donut. I informed him that I was there to do a drop in and that we are from out of town. I was harshly told that they only do appointments because they need to inform other trainers and get everything set up. Even though we let him know that we have been doing CrossFit for a while he said that we couldn't be helped. Didn't know I was wasting his time, but his short answers and negative attitude made that very evident.

yes, I arrived at 4:31pm. Wasn't trying to be late. And you were not involved in the conversation & did not hear it. Short, rude answers from someone acting holier than now is not being treated with respect. I've dropped in to many Crossfit boxes & never had to check in prior. It wasn't that we weren't allowed to drop in. It was how we were turned away.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dbfbbca9f9591f:0x2da7158dc8ab50e9<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
So, this is a long overdue review.  I started my journey at Ironfire Athletics in October of 2012 and never turned back since.  In 2012, I was in constant lower back and hip pain. Of course I was super scared too, but I was ready to try something different and was hopeful it would help with my back and hip issues.  So fast forward to December 2017…. I have accomplished many personal records (PRs), competed in a few competitions and a powerlifting competition.  All of which I never once imagined I would ever be able to do.  OH…. I can do a handstand and other movements I would have never imagined too!  If you are looking for a gym that truly cares about you, your safety, movement and your goals then IFA is the gym for you. If you are unable to do a specific movement then there is always a scaling option.  IFA is good for anyone at any age.  Both my children, ages 10 and 8 also do it and absolutely love it.  Jason and Alfia are amazing owners and coaches and know how to help you reach your goals and get you very strong.</review>

$3,540 for 1 year is the only membership now for new members, seriously. Was a member for a year and a half.  Out of the 3 crosstraining gyms that I've been a member at this was the least fun. Nice equipment though< /Review>

Having been an athlete my entire life, but stopping partway through college like many do,  it was hard to get back into a fitness routine that gave me the same motivation and drive like sports did.

Enter Ironfire. They've managed to satisfy all my needs when it comes to training. From the intensity and diversity in programming, to the amazing coaching staff, and strong community, Ironfire has reinvigorated my love for fitness.

Hands down the strongest I have ever been!</text>

I've been part of IFA since 2014.  The trainers provide a well-rounded program building strength, cardio, gymnastics, and flexibility into each workout.  The emphasis is on doing movements with good form and scaling the weight or movement is always an option with each workout.  The gym builds community and the owners and trainers encourage personal improvement for each athlete.   Great way to start each morning!< /Review>

I joined IronFire after moving to San Diego almost 3 years ago.  Having done crossfit in the past, in my neighbors garage, I felt I knew what to expect. However, the community of trainers and fellow athletes here far exceeded my expectations!  Not only do they cultivate a great peer community of support and friendly competition, but I've also learned MANY new techniques and hone countless others every week!  IronFire athletics is my fitness home, and I recommend them highly!</Review>

Honestly I can't say enough good stuff about Ironfire. I have been there for 7 years now and I am so happy that I got so lucky with a great gym right off the bat. It is a perfect mixture of training, community, and fun! I have never looked so fit (ok well I still love ice cream) as now. I used to think I knew how to work out but I was sooooo wrong. Needless to say the trainers pay really close attention to detail so literally no one gets injured there. LOVE LOVE LOVE this gym!!!<//Review>

It seems the community of gym is very supportive of one another. I didn't make an appointment to be able to join the class that I had hoped, so that really wasn't too great. I wish that the Yelp page would have said Yes under appointment needed.<//Review>

< review>
So I try to drop in at CrossFit Poway, and when I was "greeted" I was asked if I could be helped as though I just took the jelly out of his donut. I informed him that I was there to do a drop in and that we are from out of town. I was harshly told that they only do appointments because they need to inform other trainers and get everything set up. Even though we let him know that we have been doing CrossFit for a while he said that we couldn't be helped. Didn't know I was wasting his time, but his short answers and negative attitude made that very evident.

yes, I arrived at 4:31pm. Wasn't trying to be late. And you were not involved in the conversation & did not hear it. Short, rude answers from someone acting holier than now is not being treated with respect. I've dropped in to many Crossfit boxes & never had to check in prior. It wasn't that we weren't allowed to drop in. It was how we were turned away.</review>

<Text>I've been going to IFA for over 2 years, and still love it as much as when I started. With help and programming from IFA and coaches/owners Jason and Alfia, I worked through an ACL injury, and am now stronger than before. All workouts are scalable to your ability and fitness level. But more important than even the great workouts is the community of people that work and work out here. Everyone supports, encourages, and challenges each other, regardless of skill level. They all know each other by name, you are not just another anonymous person at the gym. Love IFA!<//Text>< pictures>

So, this is a long overdue review.  I started my journey at Ironfire Athletics in October of 2012 and never turned back since.  In 2012, I was in constant lower back and hip pain. Of course I was super scared too, but I was ready to try something different and was hopeful it would help with my back and hip issues.  So fast forward to December 2017…. I have accomplished many personal records (PRs), competed in a few competitions and a powerlifting competition.  All of which I never once imagined I would ever be able to do.  OH…. I can do a handstand and other movements I would have never imagined too!  If you are looking for a gym that truly cares about you, your safety, movement and your goals then IFA is the gym for you. If you are unable to do a specific movement then there is always a scaling option.  IFA is good for anyone at any age.  Both my children, ages 10 and 8 also do it and absolutely love it.  Jason and Alfia are amazing owners and coaches and know how to help you reach your goals and get you very strong.</Text>

Maria Lewis went way out of her way to be helpful, which was greatly appreciated. She also sent David of the maintenance crew over the same day to fix a longstanding problem with the fridge, which turned out to be a simple fix. I thank them both again for making this a pleasant place to stay. Also, it's sure nice to see people again after a long lockdown : )</text>

<text>Please don’t trust these other reviews. This is a Terrible place to live. Once you move in management doesn’t care about much else other than getting their rent money. I know for a FACT they rent to those who have warrants in not only California but other states as well. I have lived here for over a year and it’s gotten worse. Ive even been told by SEVERAL police officers to move out as soon as I am able  because of the type of people this apartment complex attracts. We are leaving! Please anyone feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns or want an inside HONEST opinion before you commit . Don’t trust the “crime free” sign outside the gates... if you WANT crime brought to your doorstep move in here. Email is ratracer169@gmail: AGAIN PLEASE IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING LIVING HERE reach out to me and I will show you proof of all the reasons to stay away. Stay safe everyone. God bless. 🙏🏼<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>My family and I have lived at the Villas for 6 years. It is such a wonderful community to live in!
Maria has been the most accommodating and dedicated staff we’ve ever had. It truly saddened me when I learned that she was transferred to another property.

We have been living here for about 6 months now. This complex is lovely and beautiful. It's gated and makes it very secure for children, as we have a 3 year old. We had an issue with our fridge and Anthony was our maintenance technician. He was really nice and walked us through how to make sure our fridge doesn't ice up. Thank you Anthony for you work and we appreciate all the staff here for being very friendly! It's a great place to live.<//text>

The Villas at Towngate is a really nice place to live; it's clean, quiet, safe, and well maintained. We just recently moved in and had a great experience with the process. Maria in the office was super helpful and friendly through the whole process and helped us through all the ins and outs of the application process. Right now with the difficulty of finding an available apartment on short notice in Moreno Valley made Maria's help was invaluable. The units are nice and a good value for the price. We highly recommend the Villas!<//Text>

<review>I recently moved to The Villas at Towngate in Moreno Valley because I was not happy with the community I had been living in. Management was rude anytime an issue with my unit would come up.

The Villas at Towngate have an amazing staff that are always ready to help whenever an issue may arise. Lynn is the property manager and she has always ensured that any work order I have requested is promptly addressed and fixed. This would not be possible without the help of great team members like Frank and Anthony from maintenance. They are highly skilled and are well prepared to fix, replace, and install anything.

Thank you to the staff for providing a exceptional service.</review>< pictures>

Lived here for one year, wish it could have been less. About a month in I noticed how many bums would come in and sleep in the electrical rooms and dug through the trash so you can only imagine the mess. The office never answers their phones and the gates where always broken. Save yourself the time and skip this place</Review>

He really goes above and beyond and makes you feel that professional hospitality from the apartment complex. He has got all the things that make customer service stand out: smile, friendly, understanding, quick and professional and knows what he is doing since he is an experienced general contractor.

I originally had my heart set on another property and just happened to stop by the Villas at Towngate. This decision changed my life! I immediately fell in love w/ the hardwood floors, Quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, and spacious layout of this community. I was equally impressed with Maria’s warm personality, and willingness to answer all my questions, and ability to accommodate my specific needs. I am super excited to be moving to this community and highly recommend you consider this property if you are looking to move in the near future!

<review>My family and I moved in about a month ago and we absolutely love it!!! The apartment is absolutely beautiful completely renovated, the location of my apartment is in a great spot! It’s very quiet, all the girls in the front office were all very kind, helpful and welcoming!! My water heater went out last week and maintenance was quick at fixing it! Over all my experience here has been great and the staff is very friendly!! My only complaint would be the parking, I see lots on cars with expired tags utilizing parking spots, that is a big issue here cars that are using up guest parking with broken down, non registered cars.
Some you can tell have not moved in a while because they are covered in cobwebs, which is an inconvenience for some families that have two cars because then we are forced to park on the street.< /review>< pics>

Even though they didn't have any apartments available to rent I give a 5 star, the community looks very beautiful and well maintained. Kimberly gave us a virtual tour and was very sweet, patient an explained the different layouts. The availability wasnt there for me but I would have loved to rent a 3 bedroom.Thank you again</Text>

I am going on my 1yr mark at the  Villas, and for the most part it has been a good experience. I've had minor issues, and due to COVID-19, I wasn't able to enjoy the amenities.  However, I can say that the staff here is good. I am huge on customer service, and 9/10 times the staff has been really good. The office/property manager Lynn has always been great, and her staff has always been wonderful anytime i needed to speak with them. Thank you to the maintenance team for everything they do. I do recommend this property.<//Review>

Hello I’ve enjoyed the special relationship I’ve had with Maria at the front office since I moved here in 2019.  Maria has always treated me with special care and attention and she has a sincere down to earth personality that helps ease any stress you may have and works hard to make sure your needs get met as fast as possible. If she can’t meet them she advocates to get things done as fast as possible :)). Crystal has been very sweet and responsive with requests as well as Kiml with pool reservations . The manager has also been kind.  We feel like part of a community now which is especially helpful during this pandemic .  Management has been kind and flexible during the pandemic with regards to rent or any other concerns. Thank you !! Cassandra<//text>

Maria is very helpful and kind. She’s always available to tackle any issues you might have as a tenant. She cares about the tenants and it shows. She makes a point to resolve whatever issue you might have ASAP. Likewise, Frank, the maintenance supervisor is also very nice and works hard to resolve issues promptly and efficiently.< /Review>

I cannot say enough great things about the maintenance staff here! Since moving in October of last year (from out of state), they have been pleasant and courteous with every request. I have two dogs (one is a new and very vocal rescue), so I have begun noting that I need to be home for my work orders.

During this time of COVID, they called to schedule an appointment to fix a sticking gas burner. On the day of the appointment, they knocked, but I asked that they reschedule as I needed to take one of the dogs to an emergency vet appointment. Both guys were very understanding and told me that they could be back later on in the day, to which I agreed. Unfortunately, the vet appointment took longer than anticipated, so I missed the time a second time!

I resubmitted the work order a week later with a note for a Tuesday or Wednesday date. On Monday afternoon, the maintenance techs gave me a call to set a time on Tuesday afternoon. They arrived promptly, and quickly fixed the issue, and then had me test it to make sure that everything was working well. While they were in the apartment, I asked about a few minor things (replacing blinds and the air filter), and they offered to get the replacements for me right then and there.

Anthony (who is the newest maintenance technician) made me feel at ease with his amazing customer service. Instead of silently doing the task in the kitchen while I was in the living room, he introduced himself and was very friendly while being trained by Frank.

Frank was quick and efficient, and did everything with a smile. He explained everything to me that he was doing as he did it, and was the one to offer to check the vents after I asked. He has great insight and was so polite with my thousands of questions.

If you have any concerns about any small issues in the apartments here (it happens everywhere), then you should feel comfortable knowing these guys have got you covered!<//text>

I would not recommend leasing here or even going through the trouble of trying to contact them. I spoke with a leasing agent, Destiny, who gave me a quote of $1,475 per month and said there would be a unit available for my desired move in date. I went online and applied for $45 to the property and after being accepted a different agent called me back and told me the rent would actually be $1,875 and that I would not be able to move in until several weeks after my requested move in date. I explained this is not the quote I was given and then made to feel like I was making the whole thing up. For two straight days I attempted to contact the original agent I spoke to that gave me the false information and was sent to voicemail every time or transferred to their central leasing agency who didnt want to help me. Then the very next day they lowered their rates again on the website, but said I would be stuck with the $1875 since that was the rate on my application. Awful service, dont recommend.</Text>

My second review after two years and I am still very satisfied being a resident here. The staffs(Maria,Arny,Anthony and David) and others are friendly towards I and my kids,ready to assist and courteous. I read a bad review someone wrote and I totally disagree. I haven't witnessed or been a victim of any crime and most of the families living here are working class people who go about their business. Thank you guys for making this apartment worth living.< /review>

<Text>I had a plumbing emergency with my kitchen sink. In the morning about 9:15am I submitted a work order request to have maintenance come to fix the problem. And to be perfectly honest, I thought I would not get a response for several hours or a day or two.  But about 45 minutes or less, Anthony showed up with all that he needed to fix the problem. While he was here, Anthony also fixed my ice maker in the refrigerator while he was here. He was great and very professional.  I am pleased as to how quickly he came because I found that there are only a couple maintenance personnel to take care of over 300 apartments.  Great job.</Text>< Pics>

I personally needed this assistance for the the month of April and the staff was extremely understanding and very prompt and courteous in setting me up with an affordable repayment plan. I have never been through anything like this before, as I'm sure many others haven't been as well, and I assured through the whole process that I was in good hands and there was nothing to worry about. Hats off to the entire staff for their support!!<//review>< Pics>

Do not move in here!!! This place isn't safe!!! We have had two break ins while we lived here! When we brought this up with the manager they told us all they can do if file a report for their records. My mom got all her work equipment stolen! I have an insurance claim and police report filed so this isn't a lie. I was not the only one that has experienced a break in other residents I've talked too have also. It's not a secure place the gates are left open all the time and if you don't believe me take a look around the apartment and you'll see that anyone can just drive and walk in there. The gate on Dracea has never worked and they claim to fix it! To top that off parking is horrible! For over 1500 in rent this should be a better community to live in! Stop any resident and ask them they will tell you and these reviews that are on here are not true. Look at Yelp and you will see. These people do not care about the residents here< /review>

Living at Villas at Towngate is wonderful, it is quiet,clean,and friendly. What made my move in and my and my second lease easy was the leasing agent Cristal Medel she made everything fast easy and fun. She is always a phone call away when issues arise with my apartment with the upmost courtesy and promptness. I left a 5 star review because I feel Cristal deserves 4 all by herself 👏👏<//Text>

Thanks to Maria for helping me during the moving process and finding another apt. She is definitely one of the ones to reach out to if you need assistance with moving, guidance and any other questions. She kept me updated accordingly a long the way and I cant thank her enough. David also helped me plenty of times when I needed service or put in a maintenance request he tends to put in my request immediately or attend to the need as soon as possible.</Text>

<review>The villas at towngate staff and management is very unprofessional, I was dealing with a major plumbing issue in which was sewer coming through my bathtub feeling the whole tub up with black sewer and water  which kept occurring after being told
It wouldn’t come back  it had a strong smell that gave me and my kids head ache and also I told it is a disadvantage of living on the first floor. Manager never contacted me to see how everything was going and they sent out 4 different plumbers to try to resolve the issue and it didn’t work until the 5th time which was the week of thanksgiving. From November 5th to November 21 I dealt with the issue. The only reason I gave 1 star is because they wouldn’t let me not select any stars. If it was up to me it would be a 0.< /review>< Date>

Maria Lewis is exemplary of a professional leasing agent. She’s compassionate, knowledgeable, and personable who goes above and beyond!
She’s truly a blessing and I’m thankful fate led me to her. Without her patience and thinking outside of the box, I’d still be searching for a place to call home.

<text>It’s been many years now that I’ve been living at the Villas at Towngate.  What has kept me here all this time is the excellent management.  Once in a while, I will have something break down or not work. But in every instance, the management, especially the current management with the likes of Lynn, Crystal, Maria, Frank, Anthony, David, Delsey, Anthony, and not least of all Kimberly have all co-ordinated to resolve any problem that I’ve ever had.  I know them by name because of the relationships I have fostered with them.  Why bother? They treat us like its more than a job.<//text>< pictures>

Had another wonderful experience here with the team here at Villas at towngate! Shout out to Delsy. Delsy showed me a prime example of what it’s like to go above and beyond for someone. I was going through and intensely stressed situation and she was there with me every step of the way making sure everything went as smoothly as possible. She made herself available and ready during times when I needed her assistance. She was extremely patient and sympathetic during these trying times and although I don’t want to say much about the situation just know that because of her we were successful! Me and my family will be forever grateful for the greatness and compassion she has shown throughout this process. THANK YOU DELSY!!!!!

-with love from Dahlia & kids☺️</review>

I really enjoyed the tour of the apartments. Popcorn and drinks were provided at the front office. The office was a nice welcoming environment. My sales associate Kimberly was very welcoming and knew each apartment we saw. She took the time to show me each layout and answer any questions I had about moving in and the lease.< /Text>

<user_name>Nick C</user_name><review>ZERO STARS. STAY AWAY. Absolute sleazebags. I signed a lease with them about two weeks ago for a one bedroom at approx. $1360 and was excited to move in at the end of the month. Got a call from them this weekend two weeks before we were supposed to move in saying the apartment has extensive water damage and won't be ready until the end of October. I said that's fine, we will wait, no problem. They said no they can't offer the place to us anymore because they're now going to remodel it and rent it out at a substantially higher rate. They then said they could offer us nothing at the signed upon rate and could only offer apartments that were $200-$500 more expensive per month than the rate that I had signed the lease for and the only thing they could do if we would not agree to sign a more expensive lease was to refund our deposit. I called back asking them to let me see the water damage for myself, but the phones were either disconnected, or they were intentionally ignoring my calls. I haven't been able to get in touch with them since. Sketchy, probably illegal slumlord stuff going on here. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PLACE.< /review></record>

< Review>
I lived here mid 2018-2019 and the apartments itself are really really nice and very spacious!! The walls and floor were pretty thick, which is a huge plus because a lot of apartments do not have that! There is a nice view of the M especially at the pool. Would love to live here again but the downsides to this place are lack of security, the amount of crime that would happen, seeing a bunch of homeless digging through trash, at least one of the gates was broken most of the time, and the parking was ridiculous. Idk if parking has changed since mid 2019, but residents would ALWAYS park in guest spots, there was never any parking and residents would even have to park on the streets! It would be terrible when it came to street cleaning days. Was on a wait list for a garage for several months. The wait list seemed to never move up. Some parents would always let their kids run wild all over the place which was annoying at times. There were lots of downs but there were also quite a few ups that are hard to find at other apartments!< /Review>

<text>AMAZING EXPERIENCE! I have to say that today I toured 5 properties including villas ! I am in town from out of state looking for housing due to a job opportunity that I will be taking in July and I was told that California was a total stuck up state(coming from Montana)  And I did get the feeling of rudeness at other properties but when I toured at villas I have to say that my perspective was changed! I had a million questions and of them were answered by Delsy and never did I get the feeling of her being annoyed she was so friendly and such and comfortable person to talk to! She even helped me picture furniture layouts inside the apartment tour ! WONDERFUL!  Loved my tour and experience! Thank you Delsy! I will be renting here in July without a doubt!</text><rating>5< /rating>< time>

------------- I'VE CHANGED MY REVIEW, SEE UPDATE AT THE END -----------------
I lived at Villas from 2017 until mid 2019 and my complaints are all about the new administration (2019). Our lease expired ~4 months after the transition between administrations happened. I understand it was a chaotic time for the new management and so I wont give too much heat about their lack of knowledge, the numerous amount of mistakes they made (overcharging us for rent, not maintaining the website) and how slow they were to get anything done. That and their lack of good service to their tenants made us decide not to renew the lease. We were told by a member of the management team that as long as we cleaned the apartment as clean or better than how we got it, we would get all of our deposit back –which is in accordance to California Law. So we did that, spent two whole days cleaning every corner of the apartment. To summarize, we did not get our deposit back, but instead we had to pay them for their cleaning fees, painting fees, etc. After arguing that this was not in accordance to California Law, they sent us pictures of a dirty apartment with holes and other damages claiming that that was our apartment, AN APARTMENT WITH A DIFFERENT LAYOUT THAN OURS! I had to go several times to their leasing office to try to get this issue fixed. In conclusion, they did every possible trick in the book to make us pay for unnecessary fees. Absolutely horrible management. Don't trust them.
-----------------------------------------UPDATE---------------------------------------------------------
After paying for those fees, they sent us to a debt collector. Bad move.
-----------------------------------------UPDATE---------------------------------------------------------
The Manager of Alliance Residential Company reached out and apologized on behalf of management. They also sent us our money back which we really appreciated. I hope this was just a hiccup in their system and hopefully they are doing much better. Other than that, the apartment was great and spacious, we really liked it. The pool and gym were great and always clean.</Text>

Do not move here!! I repeat do not move here! I've only been living here for 2 months and they have already cut the water off 3 times but not when they say they are such an inconvenience for my family and I, then when you call the office to ask about it they say "oh they ended up not doing it today we're going to send out another notice later." Not to mention there's always dog feces on the sidewalk so gross!!! Oh and did I mention the assigned parking is so far away from where you live, imagine trying to carry your newborn and groceries. And when you call to ask them to fix things they say oh let me check on that work order for you and never get back to you and they barely ever answer their phone or emails. Save yourself the time and money and move elsewhere because I can not wait for my lease to be up!!! Oh they include the water in the rent so your rent isnt the same every month and the water bill is based off of your building and how many people live in the apartment building.< /Text>

< Review>
My company put myself and my girlfriend up at these apartments for 3 months while working at a hospital close by. We haven’t had any issues. They’ve come for maintenance when we asked. They put new lights in the parking lot when I told them the lights were out. Our apartment has been great. We were told it has new carpet and paint. We haven’t had any problems with noise or pests. It’s been a great stay! I would definitely recommend.< /Review>

Oh yea and people bring there work vehicle from work park inside and that’s why there’s no parking. Hope they do something about that.</Text>

Been living here about 5 months and overall I enjoy it. The staff is nice and professional, the units actually look like what you see online, they make efforts to keep the complex up. For the most part the neighbors are pleasant.  My only gripe is loud music from balconies sometimes and cars in the lot constantly.  This is a nice place, we don't need anyone acting ghetto. There should be signs at the gates telling anyone who enters to keep their music at a respectful volume. Residents should be able to report anyone in violation by license plate or unit number.  I really hope management looks into getting a handle on that.  Otherwise it's great.<//Text>

They make this place look clean when they tour you. But it’s dirty, staircase from J unit is nasty not to mention the ant problem. They need to hire a professional maintenance team they suck<//Text>

<review>Been here for 2 months. It is terrible. Do NOT live here. We've had rodents, backed-up pipes that flooded the apartment, and appliances break constantly for no reason.

Moved in 3 years ago in 2016 and since day 1, have been lied to starting small now big. We moved out September 18th, before then I spoke with Chris, maintenance manager, and him and a Hispanic younger gentlemen who I was told was not there anymore told me and my fiancé that due to us being there for 3 years, the carpet did NOT need to be cleaned as it was going to be replaced and that we didn’t have to worry about anything.

Fast forward, we get our refund and they charged us for the carpet. I called in and gotten the run around. Left physical messages for call backs by the office people and have gotten NO call back from Chris. Call their corporate number, the first number they gave me was to a different company, apparently the lady didn’t want me calling their corporate. Called back and got a second number for corporate, Alliance Residential, and they said they don’t have a contract with Villas and that I had to take it up with them.

After calling and talking to 4-5 different people, finally got a hold of what I assume is the “head” or property manager. They’ve all said that the carpet had soil stains and needed to be replaced and that Chris never put in the notes that we were not going to be charged. When they talk to him, won’t let me, he continually tells whoever that he tells everyone “It depends on the life of the carpet whether or not you will be charged.” He specifically told US that we would NOT be charged. Now…..I will be finding out who this Tracy Madis from AllResco is, cause apparently the Villas Manager says that Alliance Residential still handles the inquiries, and file a formal complaint, possibly pending small claims litigation. Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE management that has been swapped around NUMEROUS times in the three years we were there…</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1581534512469, 'text': 'Sean Edwards, we regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around.

We lived on the 3rd floor and had a horrible ant problem every summer. Maintenance people would come and insist entry without notice. 50% of the time I try to call the front office no one answered the phone. After I moved out, they took my deposit and sent me a bill for $1000. I definitely would not recommend these apartments.< /Review>

Past tenant that just moved out effective 6/29. I have reached out to them several times on receiving my security deposit back and have been ignored I contacted the property manager Lynn Lopez she has not returned one call or responded to my email I contacted the corporate office residentcare they only provided me an email stating corporate does not have a contact number I have been ignored and received no response they took my security deposit and haven't received no response... community be aware where you choose to live I ran out of there so quick when my lease was up now I have one more thing I have to deal with is probably going court to get my security deposit back cause they have not responded.... extremely unprofessional: last email sent to the property manager and Alliance :

Hello
I have reached out to the property manager Lynn Lopez at Villa at town gate and have left several messages for Lynn I have not received a return call or response to my email. I ask the leasing agent Crystal who has been so kind if there was a corporate number or a manger I can speak with if Lynn is busy. She stated the residentcare email is the only information she had. I as well reach out to this email and have not received a response. This corporation has been extremely unprofessional and the residentcare email does not ring true it's clear you don't care about your residents no one from your corporation has contacted me on why I have not received my security deposit after 2 months. I returned all my keys on 6/29 and left the apartment in great condition, if this is how your corporation treat your tenants after they have lived there for a year and paid rent on time this is not acceptable you can't just take someone's money and never respond and ignore them with hopes they will go away well I won't go away you can't treat people this way and I will not let you steal my 450$ there is absolutely no way your corporation can justify not sending my deposit back within 21 days or even providing an itemized list and the community should know how your company treats their tenants after they move out. this is the 4th follow-up even left a message for a lady at the corporate office named Elena. If Alliance does not truly care about their residents shame on you but I will seek further action because I have not heard anything from you within the last 2 weeks of me reaching out

I've lived here for 4 years and never once read any reviews but after being approached by someone I never met asking me to post a negative review for villas I was curious. I'm a little irritated by what I read. Yes ownership changed over a year ago and yes there's rules just like anywhere else I've ever lived. I have had nothing but positive experiences with the new people in the office and maintenance. Yes it took them a bit to get up to speed but we all do when we work somewhere new. Basically after reading the reviews I came to conclude that most of these people posting bad stuff were clearly in the wrong for something (educated guess). I saw one that was actually an old neighbor which I know got kicked out cause she didn't pay. Plus someone is soliciting negative comments cause the pool is closed. They shut down the pool and office to make it better for us tenants. I went into pay my rent and the office people were working in a construction zone doing their best to make sure all was being done right. They told me it's for a new office and they're gonna have games and a clubhouse where we can have parties for our family's and a new computer room and a pretty rad pool area. I don't agree with all the negative stuff posted here at all. I'm happy living here and I hope that other people disregard other people's drama.< /review>

We have lived her since march 2014. We really liked living here but it seems in the last few months they are going down hill.  Office never answers their phone or returns calls.  Kids have taken over the pool area all times of the day unsupervised.  More ans more trash around the grounds. More times than not lately when I come home at night the carport lights are not working or perhaps they turn them off now not sure!  Our rent has gone up every year $100. But for what they aren't improving the living or maintaining the upkeep  like before!  We definitely won't be staying here after our lease is up!< /review>

Not recommended. I can't wait for my lease to be over. Honestly for a company to take $75 for 37 min delayed on rent for paying online just shows how desperate these apartments are. They didn't even offer a 1 time waive for being late for rent for 37minutes pst . Today was the first time the apartments showed that we are not part of the villas family, today I felt like we were taking advantage of for 37 minute delayed on rent because of the system needed to add a second bank account. This will be 1 out many reviews to post regarding these apartments how 37 minutes for $75 . Honestly if you want a real home, don't come here as you won't feel at home after what I experienced today<//Review>

Every other day there are homeless people digging around in the dumpster’s and at least once a week in broad daylight! In the last two months I’ve kicked out drug addicts underneath the stairs in the J buildings! And now too too it all off there are people breaking into cars to steal whatever they can. I lived in the J building for almost one whole year now and have never even seen security. You should expect ants and roaches to crawl out of the walls< /Text>

Me and my wife used to love living here but since they recently changed ownership from Greystar to Alliance it has become horrible. We have lived here for 3 years and we wont be renewing our lease. I'm really disappointed with this new company. I hate to say this but it seems like it's getting ghetto. I would not recommend this place to anyone. John3:16</review>

<Review>Tonight was my final straw. I've been a resident at The Villas Apartments for 5 months now and I have had too many incidences happen that make me want to end my lease for good. My first experience was the horrible parking. There are residents here with family members that use the same visitor parking spaces as their OWN parking space on a daily which i find ridiculous. And NO ONE in management has done anything! Secondly, my boyfriend has to park on one of the main streets "Dracea" since that's the only parking in this complex. His car was broken into while parked on Dracea. Thirdly, I live on the 1st floor and it my apartment was broken into TONIGHT AS WE SPEAK. My boyfriend and I came back around 9:45am to notice my clothes tossed everywhere in my room. My reimbursement Ilroom was completely thrashed. Mattress completely thrashed. Pillows from my couch thrown all over the floor in my living room. You can tell they were looking for cash. They robbed me and thank God they didn't take my dog. But they stole a lot of my belongings. I called the police and they still haven't came, mind you it's 3am now, we called at 9:50pm the night before. Moral of the story, these apartments ARE NOT SAFE!!!! Do not take my review lightly. Strongly consider my experiences and avoid being a victim while you can.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Be prepared to have a terrible relationship with management. They lack communication and updating tenants, it is almost impossible to get a hold of anyone during lunch hours (seems like they all have to go at the same time). Most of the people at the desk lack experience and will provide poor information about leasing apartments and what it is offered. Parking is terrible after 8, be prepared to wait  in the parking lot for some time waiting for someone to pull out.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

The Villas At Towngate is my home and I'm happy I chose here for my first apartment. I love the layout of my apartment and I always get compliments on the pool area and kind staff.
My only complaints are NO pets, so I had to leave my cat at home with my mother; parking can be difficult, and parking can be hard to find sometimes. Keep in mind you get 3 passes for guests. Make sure they place them on their cars or they will be towed. There is also parking on the street and you could park at Winco and walk over to the Villas.
For a single woman stepping out on her own I have to say THANK YOU to the maintenance crew. They are always on top of it to help me. My air condition was acting up and they came early the next day to fix it. On another occasion a guest messed with my alarm system and it went off like crazy and wouldn't turn off. Maintenance and security came to make sure everything was okay and handled the minor emergency quickly. Maintenance are always polite and you can request they call before entering or allow them to enter while you're away. Security walks about sometimes but anytime I called they came quickly to either quiet a loud nuisance, etc. And the front desk is always helpful during their hours to handle minor concerns like neighbor disputes. This is a friendly location for all kinds of people from families to single occupants.
I might pay a bit more than the rest of the MoVal area for my one bedroom but I'm guaranteed safe. I left my door open accidentally one night and nothing bad happened. I've also never seen a vehicle broken into like other apartment complexes.<//text>

<Text>Hey Michelle!! I talked to a couple residents in the building where you said my kids are being disrespectful .. oh bummer guess what.. they say it is not my kids they have problems with.. unfortunately my kids happen to have been there when you went down to see what the problem was. Unfortunate that you view my kids as disruptive and unruly because of the nearly 6 years that we've been residents here I've never had a complaint against us including my kids.. my son did say he was playing with a flat ball and that a resident asked him nicely to please be careful not to hit a car he said ok and stopped.. my kids were in the wrong place at the right time to take the fall for others disturbances.. my mother was watching them and can tell you how things played out.. so I guess just because you saw my kids downstairs playing you infact did not see them being disruptive and felt you could blame them for it. Of all the years I've lived here first time I'm super pissed off.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I miss Natasha.... im.glad we are moving out soon this place is getting gettho we've living here for almost 3 years quiet neighborhood and nice apartments but now I see policeman around 3-4 times as week....my car has broken into once.... gates are broken most of.the time so what's the point of being a gated community... there's ALWAYS anytime everyday a line of cars parked outside the gate waiting for someone to open the gate so they can come in..... again what's the point of being a gated community? ??? Pets not allowed???? I've seen everyday at least 4 -5 diferentes breeds of dogs.... peeing pooping in front of my patio and owners who doesn't clean after their dogs so I always see dog pop on the grass.... parking is a nightmare no enough open parking so if you have 2 cars either rent a garage port or park most of the time on the streets. New management hardly answer their phones.... they never sent an introductory letter .....nothing. Things are going bad here. We liked this place since the beginning but again is going bad..... good luck !<//Text>< GmapID>

<Review>terrible officer!!!
I got a parking ticket 4 days ago and said I needed to clean my car and get a CA driver license plate cuz I just moved form WA. I cleaned my car and went to ask their officer (I do not know his name but he is a black guy) to get help. I made an appointment with DMV for changing the license plate, but it has to take two weeks to finish. I told him my situation and he said I could just park my car under the roof then everything would be fine! after 4 days, I found out my car got towed and I have to pay $411 to get it back!! I went to ask this officer why he lied to me!! He said he did not promise the car would not be towed, and then our vioce got high and he sarted yelling to me with extremly horrible attitude. He was poingting and yelling to me!!!! He even blamed on me and said it’s my fault!!! He kept saying he did not guarantee anything!!! He is a liar!!!!!!
I cannot believe it was really happening to me!! I am his resident but he treated me like his enemy and asked me to stand outside of his office!!
I am going to move out ASAP, I just cant stay in this apartment anymore! feel so sad after I walked out from the office and I was discriminated by him for sure.
DO NOT be a resident with this company!!!<//Review>< time>

<Text>The management here is pretty terrible. I have called numerous times about my car being hit an scratched while being parked in my car port and never got a call back from the management in the front. We currently pay 1295 for rent and when we moved in our carpet was stained from the previous tenants and the doors had holes in them. We were told they would get replaced and it's been 7 months into or lease. Parking here is also terrible. There are very little open spots since they only offer one dedicated parking spot. The gates are also always broken letting random people come in and out all hours of the day. Security here is also very rude. Instead of patrolling the properity, they sit parked indront of the mail boxes sometimes asleep or not paying attention to what is going on around thwm. I would recommend to all to spend the money renting out a house than moving into this place.</Text>< user>

Im not sure where all these complaints are coming from. Pretty sure the people in these comments probably were nasty to the employees. Im extremely happy with everything. This management has managed to get rid of some of the bad seeds and Im happy to see that personally. Its tough to clean up a community. My advice is...be a bit patient and give these guys some time to do their job :) ps the manager, Michelle, takes every complaint personally and will personally do her very very best to take care of any problem you may have!!!</text>

<Date>1465603640025< /Date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>The one star is for what the property use to be! My family and I have been here since 2012, we use to enjoy living here. A few months ago Greystar sold the property to Alliance. This has been a horrible transition (if that's what you call it!) They took over about 3 months ago and still no update of information such as who we call for maintenance, security, tow company, or even a introduction letter.The office staff is extremely rude, never greet you when you walk in and never smile! It took 3 months to get rent statements, in fact this past month I didnt even recieve one and when I called to get my balance due the lady told me "maybe you should check your mail more" (I check it everyday).  The maintenance is a bunch of lazy, rude people too. The property use to have a landscaper that kept this place beautiful! The old maintenance was friendly and efficient. I really miss everyone from the old staff! Oh then there is the pets!!! We use to be a pet free community, apparently this changed but there has been no notification on this except this past week everyone got a notice on there door saying if pet poop is not picked up and disposed of properly there would be fines, funny thing is the onsite property managers dog poops in front of our building (E) and leaves it there!!! Its so gross and a pain in the butt with a toddler running around outside. I could go on and on but you get the point...This place once felt like an actual community and was a nice place to live. Unfortunately its turning into a garbage ghetto place to live and the staff is assisting in that process. We are looking forward to our lease being  up so we can leave!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dca5f99664c4df:0xe3489294f12020e2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>
<time>1418242704047<//time><Review>The employees at the office are friendly, but don't let that fool you because their promises doesn't amount to anything. During my lease I became sick making it difficult for me to walk up to my third floor unit. So I went to the front office to speak to the office manager and her assistant Jessica. At first they seemed sympathetic in regards to my situation. They informed me that I can end the remainder of my lease due to illness. I was also told that I can only be charged for one month, if I can't find someone to rent my apartment or if my apartment remains vacant.  Fortunately, I found a person that has already been approved by them and had left a deposit for another unit. The person, known to me as Stephanie made appointment with the assistant manager Jessica to view a similar apartment since they cannot show  my apartment with me still living there. The prospective tenant, Stephanie, drove over thirty miles from Rancho Cucamonga to Moreno Valley for the appointment. Upon arrival she found the office doors locked with a notice saying that they will be right back. After waiting for nearly 45 minutes, she left. All phone call messages she left following, after the failed appointment, went unreturned. The Villas At Towngate action fraustrated her until she gave up on them. Later, I was told that they forgot that she had appointment with them. After I moved out, from my apartment, their accounts receivable clerk sent me a demand letter stating that I own them $4,637.36 because they have not being able to rent out my apartment and in addition, refused to refund my one month deposit. I later discovered that their real name of the parent company is Riverstone Residential Group doing business as "The Villas At Towngate." Please use prudent judgment in deciding if this is the type of landlord that you want to do business with.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dca5f99664c4df:0xe3489294f12020e2< /gmap_id><response>None< /response><user_id>117725735588713202498< /user_id><name>John “Professor” Alizor, PhD<//name>< rating>

they are Jerks who are intimidating towards vunerable women. They became angry with my wife because  she chose to move rather than renew her lease, so they tried to trump up false cleaning charges on her. Apt was left spic and span, Dont move there, youll be sorry. Plus cars drive thru the parking lot like bats out of hell</Text>

Great deals, friendly staff :)
There was an incident where I had gotten less than what I paid for, I went back see if I could get what they forgot (thinking to myself “good luck”) and they were so nice and helpful! I’m more than happy to have this be my new spot to pick up! ❤️💛💚</review>

It’s open 24 hour.  There’s parking in the front and plenty more in the back.  Easy on, easy out.  The door sometimes feels like it locked but it’s not. Keep trying!</review>

I attempted to view what selection they had. I entered the store with my husband. The man at the counter said that he would allow my husband to enter but not me. He looked at me with no expression and made the comment of how he feels like I have a gun. I said outloud that I was done. As I was walking out he said he was joking. No clue why you would joke about that. Especially as an employee of a dispensary. Such disrespect. I ended up going to another dispensary where I was treated as a human being. I will never ever recommend this place to anyone.<//review>

<Text>I went in today as my first time and bought a kingpen cartridge as ive had those before and were at a very low price. When I hit that cartridge, I realized it was FAKE THC OIL as it tasted very weird and plastic like. I went back and ask to get my money back but they said they couldn't do that, after explaining the product they sold me was fake, I asked them if any of their products were certified or tested by some of the agency's that oversee these products like the FDA or CBB or even the department of agriculture and they couldn't prove that either. I then asked to speak to a manage and they said there was no Manager.  I got my money worth in weed which is not what I wanted because I had already bought weed but since I couldn't get my money back I had to get that again so I didn't lose my money. Very upset and WARNING YOU ALL THAT SOME OF THIS PRODUCT IS NO LEGIT AND CAN HARM YOUR HEALTH.< /Text><Response>None< /Response><user_name>John Chem<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Raul is the best! One very windy day, there was an Edison outage for much of our city. Without electricity, I couldn't open my garage door which wasn't connected to my apartment or any external door. I called maintenance to explain I had a job interview that afternoon & needed my car. Someone came out with a ton of keys but couldn't find the one that would open my garage. Raul showed up and said she can't wait and drilled out the lock! He replaced the lock and secured the door for us, during my interview.

I got the job & was so grateful, I baked him cookies and told the manager how much I appreciated his understanding the urgency of the moment. Any time we need maintenance, we're happy when Raul shows up at our door!</text>

<Review>This place was nice when we moved in in May 2019. It was quiet, clean and our neighbors were respectful. Over the past couple months the sidewalks have become stained, there is constantly trash thrown about and our apartment vibrates randomly throughout the week from loud music (as it's doing at this very moment). The price is way too high for the standard it's at.</Review>< Pics>

One of the few properties that has actual humans with a friendly smile and courteous help. Sokhom was the Reserve representative and was overly helpful on every subject/inquiry we had. She was in touch every few days whether email or phone. We contacted a hand full of properties…no one even remotely close. They know the business and handle it well! Good place to visit and belong to! Highly recommend this place/experience!

Reserve at Empire Lakes is a great place to live at! First, the staff is wonderful. Stacey, the community manager, is responsive and genuinely cares about the community. I have had the chance to work with each person from the leasing team (Sokhom, Johnson, Jimmy, and Destiny), and each of them is kind and helpful. The service team is also great. The one or two service requests that I have had have been addressed quickly and professionally. There are many apartment communities in the area, however, the team here sets this community apart from any other. Second, the apartment homes here have gorgeous finishes and the layouts are spacious and unique. The kitchen is my favorite part, with an island, tons of counter space and plenty of cabinets. Third, the area and neighborhood around the community has everything one needs. It can't be beat. There is every restaurant that you can think of, and there are tons of shopping options, within walking distance. Even though there is much to do in the area, the community is still tucked away behind all of the stores and restaurants, and it is pretty quiet for the most part. I feel very at-home and comfortable at The Reserve!<//text>

This place is amazing. We’ve been here since August and absolutely love it here. Everything from applying to moving and up until now with any maintenance requests or questions for the leasing office has been so easy. I’ve mainly felt with Jimmy, from day one he has been pleasant to deal with, very professional and nice. The property is taken well of, no trash anywhere and always clean. I’d definitely recommend these apartments to anyone.< /Review>

I love the staff here at The Reserve at Empire Lakes they’ve always been super respectful and professional! This morning I realized I haven’t had hot water and called the office. Destinie took my emergency work order and it took only a max of 30 minutes before a maintenance professional came to address the issue. Even with my screaming bouncy toddlers he was very polite to all of us and was able to fix our water! 😁👍🏼<//Review>

<Review>The apartment complex itself is centrally located in the perfect area. Be aware of all the extra charges they will charge you when you move out. Don’t bother cleaning because they will charge you for that. They will also charge you for paint and carpet cleaning after living there for a year. They took my deposit and are asking for an additional $300 for BS fees. I have never been charged extra when I moved out of an apartment because I take good care of where I reside. This place is a scam. I lived at Verano in rancho and I recommend them over this place. Good luck using the amenities there because that’s a joke too.<//Review>< Response>

Requested some maintenance items before work and they were all fixed when I got home, Raul is so awesome!

<Text>Community is five star:
Moved in not to long ago and have had nothing short of a great time. The community is clean, the staff is very friendly and accommodating, the apartments are clean, I can't think of any thing negative to say!
Location is five star:
The location of these apartments is prime as well. Right next to the Mall, plenty of gyms around, easy drive to the beach and its just as easy to get to the mountains!
Safety is five star:
The community full of kind people and I haven't had any worry so far as to lack of security.</Text><gmapID>0x80c3359bb08df28b:0xa0525b976fa8df24</gmapID>< name>

My fiancé and I have lived at the Reserve for about 3 years. I can truly say that we are enjoying our time here. Sokhom and the office staff are super nice and always address any concerns, or questions we may have.

Although some residents may not be the best at cleaning up after themselves or their pets, Raul and the maintenance team take care of it right away. The property stays clean and is pretty quiet.

Also when you stay here, you accrue Equity Residential credits to use towards purchasing a home in the future. We are hoping to be home owners in the future.</Review>

There are two pools and jacuzzis to enjoy, a gym, a media room which you can rent out, a small dog park, and there’s food trucks every now and then out by the leasing office.
The location is great too you have a huge mall and SO MANY restaurants and cafes, and also a target for your general grocery needs.

My husband and I enjoy living at The Reserve.
So far we've had a positive experience.
We love living within walking distance to Target, restaurants and the Mills.

We haven't had any problems with finding parking.

Office staff has always been polite and helpful. Raul from the Maintenance Staff has also been extremely helpful, polite and professional when we reported an issue with our AC unit. He also follows up to ensure that our issue was addressed.

The only concern I have is the fact that the trash gets full really quick.</review>

Reynaldo Rodriguez-Molina came to attend to the work order that was placed for a couple of things to be repaired.  When I added one more item to be repaired he did it with no problem.  He didn't tell me I had to put the work order in for it first,  he just took care of it.  Reynaldo is a very professional and respectful maintenance man with a very cheerful attitude.  Thank you Reynaldo for the repairs you did for us.  They were very much appreciated.<//Review>

We love it here. By far the best apartments ever. Great staff and very clean. Sokhom, Stacy, Jennifer, Stan, Raul, and the rest of the team are amazing. They make you feel right at home. All of our maintenance requests get handled quickly and efficiently. Property is always looking it's best. Parking is fine. Even my visitors like coming to my home. All of the shopping centers are close. Love right by the mall. Quick access to the freeways as well. What more could I ask for.<//Review>

I have reached out and in one case it was slow to resolve, in the other it was refused.

That's the second time the response to reach further has been offered, and I would like to do so, what would be great is if a way to contact them would be provided along with the suggestion.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Had to move in right away (in 1 day to be exact) and everyone at The Reserve worked together and made it happen. Love dealing with Ashley, she is very kind and her customer service is above and beyond! I've also dealt with Ryan and Jennifer and they as well are outstanding. It doesn't stop there, the maintenance dept is very efficient, especially Raul. I've never had to wait 48 hours for a service order, even when placing it online, they come right away which I love. I've been a resident for a few months and so far so good :) Glad to call The Reserve home!</review>

<Review>I put in a service request for a leaking hot water heater.  In less than 10 minutes Andros was at my door to take care of it. He fixed the problem in  no time,  it was a leaking hose. I  still can't believe the promptness.  I'm very impressed with the service I received.</Review><rate>5< /rate>< date>

This apartment complex is great. My apartment has a nice layout and the  bedroom is pretty big - have a king size bed! Love the kitchen and that there is in unit washer/dryer. There are two pools in the complex and they both have BBQs which is awesome. Plus, you can walk to Ontario Mills mall and shop, you can walk to Target, you can pretty much walk and get tons of food/shopping.<//review>

I lived there for a year and a half. It was wonderful. I had a great corner location close to the pool. Office staff was always so nice! They have events and food trucks set up for the community! Sokhom was the best! She set me up with the apartment and checked in on me often, and always made sure I was happy with where I was living. I'm sad I moved out but it was for a good reason, we bought a home! If for any reason we have to go back to apartment living, the Reserve is my first choice!< /review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>This apartment complex is very beautiful however for $1650, everything in the apartment are substandard and cheap. The interior needs updating. Not sure who the builder is, but the walls are paper then. I can hear people's conversations, music, and snoring when my house is very quiet. I was displeased seeing a couple of car getting broken into, and there's constant blackouts for hours which has caused my food to go bad several times. Other than that everything else is pretty nice. Great location with plenty of stores around. I continue to see the prices in rent go up but dont have the basics to be considered as a luxery apartment which is a huge problem.</Text>< gmap_id>

I honestly love this place. I've lived here before and chose to come right back. Best staff ever. Cleanest property ever. Sokhom, Jennifer, and Stacy in the main office are awesome and always so polite. Stan, Raul, and the maintenance team are amazing as well. Love that they have a dog park. They also have a grassy area for the kids to play. The property is always looking maintained. Enjoy going to the gym, game room, and theatre room. Love all of the amnesties you get for living here.< /text>

<Review>Leasing agent sokhom is great to work with. She made our move out simple and smooth.

The theee stars are for the community.
As for the community itself, it’s been getting worse and worse over the past few years. We had our garage broken into and items stolen TWICE. mailboxes were being broken into. Parking passes for spots are a joke. And the rent continues to go up, with the community getting worse. It was time to leave.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This property is not disability accessible, hardly anyone leaves the first floor. Noise can be a issue if you live in between the alleys, the neighbors can be disrespectful and unfriendly but that is Southern California mentality, Los Angeles, specifically IE not the nicest people. Please be aware that the area is not great in Education and does not strive to be. Services for children lack as well.

As for the apartment itself the complex is clean except trash areas where neighbors can be messy and disrespectful of how to properly throw away trash and pick up after their dogs.  Office staff is nice and informative to their policies anything more specialized beyond the contract it is best to contact corporate office.< /review>

<text>PICE: High, this is Rancho Cucamonga.
LOCATION: Convenient!
SAFETY: Good. Some robberies of course, like everywhere. Just be smart; be aware of your surrounding, don't forget to close/lock your door and garage (I have seen people leave it open and they have many things inside, of course somebody will steal). I have left mine open by accident many times by not clicking well, but mine is empty.
STAFF: Great! I complain and they solve it! I am including the office staff, maintenance staff and cleaning staff; all very nice and trustworthy.
PARKING: A bit limited for guests, but residents have reserved spaces if registered. Your car will get towed if you don't follow the rules...duh... This is to respect those who do!
COMMUNITY: Well like everywhere; there are those who respect and are considerate and those who aren't. For the most part I would say most people are great. There are some who smoke (cigarettes or weed) knowing this is a smoke-free complex... I have indicated to the staff this once, specifying the apartment number and they solved it, I no longer inhale that substance through my apartment window...
MAIL: Love the package room, I have not gotten anything stolen considering it is a shared space for residents.
NOISE: At least in my area, it is good. I am in front of the pool, so on weekends there are families that are enjoying their time and will be loud, for the most part this is rare. I can hear footsteps, obviously... So if you aren't tolerant, choose the third floor.
POOL AREA/GYM: Clean! The cleaning staff cleans daily! Thank goodness because I am obsessive with this.
EVENTS: They organize nice events or food trucks to come occasionally; that is nice.

CONCLUCION: Love it.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

From the very first moment that my husband and I seen Jennifer we felt like it was home. Even our dog Orla loved it! We knew it was the place for us. The manager Stacey and office staff go above and beyond, and exceeded any expectations we had. If we ever have to move we will definitely stay with Equity Residential! We feel very safe and secure here.<//review>

<review>The apartments are nice don't get me wrong I really like my place the only downside is the people that live in this apartment complex are so nasty! They don't like to pick up after themselves they leave their trash piled up outside their front door for days on end. Oh and if they drop something like food or a bag of garbage they will let it sit there without any thought to pick it up. It's pretty gross who would have thought grown adults wouldn't have the common decency to pick up after themselves it amazes me.<//review>< rating>

I thoroughly enjoy living here at The Reserve at Empire Lakes.  One of the things that stands out the most for me is the Service Team.  They are efficient, friendly and professional.  They went over and above when fixing my garbage disposal & bathroom sink.  The office staff go over and above and are willing to help with even things like accepting packages. The community is conveniently located near restaurants and the Ontario Mills Mall.  Residents even get a discount at 4th & Mill!  So far my favorite place to live!  I love calling The Reserve our home!<//review>

Do not move here !!!! I decided to move here even after seeing these bad reviews and to give them a chance let's just say paying 1500 for a one bedroom is ridiculous in it's self but we loved the location ! After about a month here we noticed people smoking weed in there garage as if it was a local hang out a bunch of people would come and go... Also a couple of times my fiancé would leave for work at 3 am he would walk down the stairs and encounter random bums who were on some type of drugs... We only lasted here 6 months because we couldn't take it anymore also don't expect to get back any of your deposit they charge you for just about everything painting fee I only had 2 things hung up and also the carpet is a joke light carpet so all the previous stains from previous tenets  that were cleaned come right back after a month of living there and we never walked on the carpet with shoes ! Also if you want to get into contact with someone in the office you'll have to try about 10 times before someone answers< /Review>

<Text>PICE: High, this is Rancho Cucamonga.
LOCATION: Convenient!
SAFETY: Good. Some robberies of course, like everywhere. Just be smart; be aware of your surrounding, don't forget to close/lock your door and garage (I have seen people leave it open and they have many things inside, of course somebody will steal). I have left mine open by accident many times by not clicking well, but mine is empty.
STAFF: Great! I complain and they solve it! I am including the office staff, maintenance staff and cleaning staff; all very nice and trustworthy.
PARKING: A bit limited for guests, but residents have reserved spaces if registered. Your car will get towed if you don't follow the rules...duh... This is to respect those who do!
COMMUNITY: Well like everywhere; there are those who respect and are considerate and those who aren't. For the most part I would say most people are great. There are some who smoke (cigarettes or weed) knowing this is a smoke-free complex... I have indicated to the staff this once, specifying the apartment number and they solved it, I no longer inhale that substance through my apartment window...
MAIL: Love the package room, I have not gotten anything stolen considering it is a shared space for residents.
NOISE: At least in my area, it is good. I am in front of the pool, so on weekends there are families that are enjoying their time and will be loud, for the most part this is rare. I can hear footsteps, obviously... So if you aren't tolerant, choose the third floor.
POOL AREA/GYM: Clean! The cleaning staff cleans daily! Thank goodness because I am obsessive with this.
EVENTS: They organize nice events or food trucks to come occasionally; that is nice.

CONCLUCION: Love it.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
The apartments are nice don't get me wrong I really like my place the only downside is the people that live in this apartment complex are so nasty! They don't like to pick up after themselves they leave their trash piled up outside their front door for days on end. Oh and if they drop something like food or a bag of garbage they will let it sit there without any thought to pick it up. It's pretty gross who would have thought grown adults wouldn't have the common decency to pick up after themselves it amazes me.</review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>So we're do I start I moved in here roughly around April of this year and to me 2 months in living here I experience having issues with my washer that kept over floating so around the 3rd time is when it flooded the most leading from the wash room to the hall way to my bathroom bedroom and living room so had to call emergency services and the maintenance worker that came was obviously upset having to come in and fix the issue and I get it I would be upset bean woken up but hey that's your job to resolve these issues so they had to tear out all the padding and lift up a good amount of the carpet to keep these blowers going for about over 2 days so imagining how much my light bill went up so the office was able to credit us an amount but they go based off two bills worth so obviously the cheapest one so they don't pay a lot which is bull to me. So now we're dealing with people upstairs bean loud from during the day till late nights talking 2am-4am like they don't sleep now we went to the office around 5 times and called security as well now the security here is a joke the first time we called made a report they never sent it over to the office or came to our apt the second time they came but don't think they went upstairs to talk to them and obviously the 3rd and so fourth finally made there way to the office and gave a report but even calling them or talking to the office people I fell like there all lazy we can tell them these issues over and over again but I fill and they can tell us all day they talked to them but I fell the people upstairs don't give to cares at all and supposedly the noise travels from one side of an apt to ours since we all charge walls but I find that hard to believe but yea my experience here has bean horrible won't renew here again oh and another note people will park in your cover car port that don't live here so for what I'm paying here in rancho I rather move back to redlands and pay less and wouldn't of bean this bad

Sorry for long story but yea be wise before u move here</review>< pics>

My move in experience was wonderful with Sokum!! The experience from my tour of the location to the actual move in date was smooth and comfortable. The staff including Sokum, Jennifer and Rylan was very inviting, warm and informative. My encounter with Stan the maintenance Supervisor was also just great.  I can say that I am really happy I made the decision to move here! So far I am enjoying the move and the apartment complex. The neighbors seem friendly. My dogs are comfortable with the nice, clean and large dog area. I do wish the parking was better, the garage is a bit small so sometimes parking in a stall is quicker so parking sucks but that is a small inconvenience!!! I did see a sketchy gentlemen that did not live in the complex one night that seemed as if he followed my daughter and I out of the complex as we were walking our dogs, he attempted to engage in a conversation with my minor daughter, I quickly put that to an end. He left walking down the street! So I say that to say I hope the security is available and present as the tow truck is at the complex!!!!< /text>< pics>

<Review>My first day I moved in was a day from you know what! First I will start with us being pretty much rushed in the office to our new apartment. The walk through was quick and the condition of the apartment was overall ok but there was some big misses like yellow stains on the bathroom floors. My refrigerator has a really bad damage piece underneath the ice maker. Some of the cabinets have damage. Now I'm seeing and noticing other things like the closet rack is breaking apart and my sliding door is coming apart from the door.  I  i hwas really excited to move in my first day but the worst thing happened MY CAR GOT TOWED!!! I went inside for less than 5 minutes and I came out and the neighbor was telling me that they took my car! I called the tow company and they were rude. I had to pay 200 dollars for me to get my car out. It would of been more if I didn't call them right away. It would of been almost $400.00! Crazy! At the end of it all it is what it is but the worst part of it was the manager Stacy I called and spoke with Ashley in the office she said she would address it and email the manager Stacy however I never got or received a call back from her. I finally call the office back on Thursday which this happened on Saturday and spoke to Jennifer a leasing agent she gave the message to Stacy and she finally called me back. If I would have not called them who knows how long it would have took her to call me back and address the problem. The rest of the staff is ok but the manager Stacey is rude and speaks to you as if she is better than you. Oh and when moving in they didn't even show me where my mail box was. Very unorganized company or staff. Not a good way to run a community. I would say the whole company isn't bad I lived at their sister property centre club and they are 10 times better and treat there community with respect plus there just as nice with cheaper rent! Think wisely before you move here.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>My wife and I have been here for almost 3 years. The community is in a GREAT location (close to the mall, target, kohls, dozens of restaurants all within walking distance) and it continues to get better and better every year with upgrades around the community. I love that it is also a gated community which was important for my wife. The staff are ABSOLUTELY amazing from Stacy to Jennifer, Rylan, Sokham all who great you with a smile and treat you with the utmost respect. The community also has a home builders credit that i would recommend as this is how we are buying our first new build home in Murrieta. I will miss this place but recommend anyone looking for an apartment to come here. You wont be disappointed!!!!!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c3359bb08df28b:0xa0525b976fa8df24< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

DON'T believe the "Rave" reviews...they bribe tenants to put good reviews up by offering gift cards and $50 rent discount! The truth is its a horrible place to live...I had to call the police when a degenerate wandered on the "private" property and was banging on my door in the middle of the night multiple times over an hour while my husband was away and I was alone with my toddler and they just stood there trying to break down my door until police arrived. Lets not forget the men that raid the dumpsters late at night and scared my nephew when taking the trash out and now they dont want to visit their aunts house anymore. There is no parking EVER and the towing company stalks anyone who parks incorrectly. The mail boxes have been vandalized and broken into at least twice and mail has been stolen. Tenants fill their garages full of crap even though they arent supposed to and their is a insect problem and adds to the parking problem. They are going to raise my rent after one year by approx. $130 and if you were banking on a month to month...it was going to be $2406 a month...for an apartment!!! Save yourself some energy, hassle, and money and look elsewhere!!!</Review>

<Response>None</Response><Text>This library is one of the nicest I've been to; it's a very clean and updated building and makes you feel very comfortable. They also have some separate areas including a literacy lab and a closed area outside that is kid friendly. I also like that it's not far from my chiropractor, so when I go to Innate Health and Healing I can easily stop in.<//Text>< Name>

Definitely one of my favorite places around San Diego.
Vegan burgers are amazing, bowls are great, and tea is comforting.
I can just sit there the whole day ..</Review>

Beautiful views the lot more services than when I grow up that's for sure. All the employees were very nice. I tried my best to get a photo without the roof. But I'd have to be standing on top of it to do it.<//Review>

<Review>Went to this library today for a change of scenery for studying.  It was beautiful, easy to find, and lots of parking.  The table I sat at had plenty of electric outlets, which was nice because I needed to charge my computer for a bit.  It was very well lit and the views of the ocean can't be beat.  I was even able to get a pick-me-up snack from the cart outside.  It looks (and sounds) like they do a lot of great programs there, but that was not a part of the visit today.  I also didn't get a chance to sit on the patio area, but I guess I will just have to sit out there next time.  I will definitely be visiting again!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I miss a lot that library. The staff is very nice, they always answer my questions. The place is amazing. Specially I love it because its natural light and the ocean’s views. I always use my ears’ plugs ( I use them in my home and other libraries too, if you are very sensitive to the noise like me, they are necessary) so, I haven’t problems with the noise. Normally people is very quite. And staff remember to someone when it is necessary to be in silent. Also they have very comfortable couchs. You can reserve a study room. I really love this library. I hope visit it soon.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

This is the nicest library you have ever seen, it is in a wonderful location with the best view. Great sitting area, amazing book selection and the staff is so nice. They have computers, a wireless printer network with Apple AirPrint, and conference rooms for your group. Also a wonderful art gallery & community room< /Review>

<text>"Wow," I sounded like a broken record. With each new section and room of the library, my breath my taken out from my lungs. While I primarily travel library to library, this one shocked me. It's so beautiful, I almost mistook it for some kind of luxury outlet. Even the outdoor coffee and the bookstore seemed like it was out of place for a library.

It's just that beautiful. Off to the sides there's venue space, gallery room, a children's nook, and even a quiet study area by the newspaper stacks. Honestly, I would stop back in for the Encinitas Library alone, on my way back through.</text>< Pics>

Nice environment of course with an ocean view ,but there are a few problems... Mainly with the public computers (the entire county system) when you  logout of the computer if you're not logged out of your email the next user will open up their email and  will be on your email inbox... unscrupulous persons  could delete or read your emails ...this is something the County Library System needs to fix... should be an easy fix.</Review>

About a year ago for some reason they started having security ROAM the LIBRARY with nothing really to do. They are BORED & sometimes overbearing. One of them has a TON of TATS looks like a former gangster from L.A . Whats the deal ? Get rid of the needless security ! Waste of money & bothersome</Review>

Nice location with easy parking, but when did a library stop being quite. Kids running around, dudes playing music loudly on their laptops. I tried to come for peace and quiet. Miss the librarians when I was a kid that made people be quiet.</review>

Beautiful library and location (you can look at the ocean! )!
Location is high up in Encinitas so best to have a car than walk or bike to it. That's the only thing I didn't like.
Very clean.  A lot of seating and beautiful views.
I want there too long so I'm not sure alp they have to offer with books/events/etc.<//Review>

The library locates at the heart of Encinitas with a fantastic view of the ocean. It is a great place to hang out to browse magazines, read books, and study. It has plenty of sitting spaces and study rooms. The staffs are friendly and helpful. It also has a coffee stand outside of the library so you can get a drink during your study break. Parking is not an issue since there are ample parking spaces. It also has a bookstore where you can find some used books at good price and its proceeds will benefit the library. All in all, a great public library with good facilities and great view!</Text>

A Library with an ocean view! There is a coffee cart in front that also sells bakery goods and fruit smoothies. The librarians are very helpful and there is self service option. Check the Library calendar for the special events!<//review>

Not right off the beaten path (freeway) however worth a field trip with the kids, ocean view and everything. They might just end up loving books too.</Text>

<Time>1485470532262<//Time><Rate>4</Rate><Review>Very comfortable, bright, modern facility and amenities, great views through large wrapping windows and friendly staff. I usually find a cozy seat in the quiet SW corner with an ottoman and peaceful ocean view; pop the earbuds in and get to work. 5 stars only if they had a few partitioned work spaces to keep distractions to a min.

Two important things I didn't see other reivews mention is free access to WIFI and POWER:
1)WIFI is free and has good coverage throughout, but it's open/unsecured like most hotspots are (e.g. coffeshops) and has some built-in restrictions to content access. Ping/Upload/Download speeds are modest but effective.

2) POWER outlets may be hard to find. HINT...look to the floor! They're tucked away in rectangular floor boxes as the library design uses a raised access floor system for HVAC and other utilities (leaves the open ceiling space look much cleaner)...see photos.<//Review>< Pics>

Friendly staff. Exceptional customer service. Explained the process in full detail. Explained what options would best suit my accommodations. Gave me a tour of unit options. Very warming & positive vibes. Definitely a good choice.<//text>

Love It it’s the only storage that actually protects your belongings in other places the units kept getting broken in to, And to many people loosing their stuff that meant more than money to some of us.. But Anaheim Self Storage Definitely Recommended to everyone<//Review>

Nearly a year ago, I chose the Anaheim Pouch Self-Storage than any other storage unit companies in Orange County, CA.  I chose it because the prices were reasonable and the staff are extremely helpful and patient.  If I ever had a question, I could always call or send an email.  When it comes to paying for my monthly payment, I can do it online!  Very convenient!  Thank you to all the employees for making me feel confident about my personal belongings being "safe and sound" at the Anaheim Pouch Self-Storage!<//Text>

I had a unit at Anaheim Pouch Self Storage for years.  From the day I got the unit until the day I emptied it the staff had always been friendly and helpful.  I always felt my possessions were secure, clean, and well kept.  It's an indoor facility so while you can't drive directly up to the unit it is accessible and they have extra carts for use.  Compared to other Storage facilities in the area they are of average price.  I would certainly recommend them to anyone who needs to store their possessions for any length of time.<//Text>

The facility is so secure & that's the most important thing to me. They are a little on the pricier side, especially if you don't pay your bill on time, but you're paying for the security & comfort & it's well worth it. The staff all knows my family & I, & they're so polite & understanding. Couldn't ask for a better storage place!< /Review>

Pouch Self Storage ANAHEIM , EAST ST Location is First Rate in Customer Service.The Staff over there Jeremy, Art and Mike are great. They took the stress of moving out, right out and off of my list of things to do and worries. I was referred by a friend (whom I helped move into her unit at the East St location) and at that time was impressed with how smooth her transition was, so when it came time for my move, well if you look at the rating... I think the rest is self explanatory. Keep up the Great work guys.

<user>107862527926957779473</user><Text>I have had several storage units before but by comparison none of them were as great as Pouch Self Storage in Anaheim. Nothing but great experiences here at this place. The staff are so friendly, always have a smile on their face and willing to help out with whatever you need.
I don't come to the storage often but when I go down to get something from my unit or put something in, I am welcomed at the counter, key ready for me, and a big smile to make my day. The two gentlemen that I see there most of the time, My. Jeremy Ball and Mr. Michael Dunne are awesome. Both equally as helpful and friendly.
It's nice to know that a long day at a storage unit, can be a great experience. Customer service is definitely the most important aspect of any successful business and these two gentlemen, are the epitomy of what exceptional customer service is.
Thank you very much Mr. Ball and Mr. Dunne for constantly making my day every time I stop by.< /Text>< date>

This was the first time that I feel sad leaving the storage as I didn't have a need for it anymore. I was suggest anyone to go here instead of public storage.

<userid>106921969103110584363< /userid><review>The quintessential LA park.  We go here every day since we live a few blocks away and have dogs.  The weather is usually great even when the rest of the city is getting fog and there's a lot of space for dogs to run around.  We've started to also jog around the park and notice the awesome skyline views of the city and just about every group of stereotypes the city has to offer.  On a warm weekend day it does get a little crowded, but that just adds to the energy you get from coming here.  We also see a lot of picnics, birthday parties, and group gatherings here too.</review><user_name>Teddy Polston< /user_name>< Pics>

Lovely gem of a park. Ample space to relax. A good place to bring your family and kids to feed the ducks and geese. The park resides on either side of the 10fwy btw. There's a bridge connecting each side.< /Text>

<Text>Took my daughter for her 6th birthday and she had so much fun! Definitely a place to try out with your kids! I love the bracelet and having everything charged to my room so I won't have to carry wallet around. They had a birthday banner on the door for my daughter along with balloons. The water park was great, it has different options from the tiniest kiddos to the adults. Restaurants have great food, arcade games were fun my daughter got 600 tickets on her first try lol check out was at 11am but I got the late check out for 2pm I was too tired to pack that early lol.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2cf9d3591a245:0xaf3942582dbf1bcc</GmapID></record>

On a good note we did get to see Sid and got a great picture of him!  We also say a baby porcupine being bottle feed (so cute) overall a short and fun experience, staff was very friendly and informative!<//text><userid>107096473254904981651< /userid><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

I love that this farm is on the smaller size! Fun to spend about 3 hours here with the girls. Petting zoo, haunted house, train ride, pony ride....some over priced lunch and call it a day!</Review>

<Text>Incredible Park that has seen dramatic improvements over the past few years. To name a few: brand new Olympic sized swimming pool that is kept in excellent condition, 2 brand new full sized basketball courts with smooth paving, updated playground for children.

Other amenities include 2 full tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball diamonds, and a skate park. In my opinion no other neighborhood park in LA County comes close.  There is plenty of room for everyone and the grounds are kept up.

My only recommendation would be to install some water fountains that also include a dog fountain at the bottom since so many people walk their dogs there.

There is also the South side of the park that is below the 60 freeway that can be accessed via foot bridge. It includes a large pond that is stocked with fish to enjoy fishing and a small ampitheatre.

To the gentleman who posted a review regarding no shade on the playground, I disagree, the playground and park itself is surrounded with plenty of trees.<//Text>< resp>

Historic Belvedere Park has been the meeting place for events,  parties,  sports,  leisure and so much more.
It's been amazing to be a part of this park's history and witness the changes it's gone through.</review>

A Safe and Fun Park for the Kids. They rebuilt the Aquatics Center and Playground area. They have picnic shelters with a barbecue grill. It's a safe area for children's parties. Nice and clean park.<//Review>

Basketball gym needs pads on the walls very dangerous for kids running full speed. LA COUNTY PARKS & RECS needs to definitely look into it before some one gets hurt and fix the nets .<//review>

<Text>They pretend they're considerate and want the kids to have fun but with ale turn a six-year-old down because the adult supposedly doesn't have correct swimming attire when I purchase the outfit it said swimwear!

Very good park has a lot of sports for kids at a low price. They offer many different classes and have many events. The pool is very clean and they have many different sections to swim in.</review>

Nice clean family friendly park. Next to the school. Grass is nice and clean well cut. The restroom are nasty dirty. That took my rating from 4 star to 3 start. Over all its a good park next to the freeway. East LA park.<//Text>

If you go there in the middle of the day to swim, it's free, but you cannot go in the deep end unless you take a swim test every single time. And you CANNOT wear flip flops walking out to the pool. BUT, if you wait a few hours and pay them $2 to swim in the evening, you MUST wear flip-flops and you can ONLY swim in the deep end, but no swim test required. The pool is really nice, but I won't be back. Their rules are just too idiotic and confusing.</Review>< pictures>

The best free swim for public around the area. Clean water, lots of lifeguards (making sure unruly kids fallowing rules 👍), lap swim and kiddy pools, check-in bags, and clean shower area with soap dispensers. Did I mention it is free?

Not a bad park, aside from the fact that I was not looking at the ground and stepped on some dog poop on the floor. This was ON the sidewalk too, not on the grass. Other than that, there's a baseball diamond where there happened to be a game going on, tennis courts and a skate park (didn't go to that side). Ok place to pass some time on a nice day.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Is definitely worth checking out if you have kids. My 3yr old niece loves the smaller pool with splash pad, while my kids can swim in one of the other 4 pools. Very clean facility, couldn't believe it was free.</text>< user>

<text>This review is only for the life guards that work at the Belvedere pool. This is my second year coming to enjoy the pool(s) during summer, and almost every time they are seen screaming at children with absent parents. Children that are old enough to go alone, and if they break minor rules they get kicked out of the pool and have to stand on the hot sun for 15 minutes. They are rude and dont have proper training to dicipline children that come to the pool. They should clearly state the rules to everyone before stepping in so they won't end up screaming at everyone because they are breaking rules that are unknown. Just because they are children, does not mean they are not entitled to be respected. They should have the level of professionalism at all times to everyone at the pool.</text>< response>

<text>This park is good has a pool has a playground for kids but if you want to go inside the pool you have to wait cuz they have a limit for people to go in and also they don't let your kids use safety arm wear. You can have picnics. There's people there that sells snacks and drinks and there's plenty of shades<//text>< pics>

This is rating is just for the kids playground:  there's no shade for the kids playground meaning most of the surfaces absorb all the sunlight and are way too hot for young children to climb and slide down.  Then the steps to climb onto the structure are much too high off the ground for young children as well meaning they must use their bare hands and arms to get up onto the burning structures.

This is southern California which is summer sun for the majority of the year so this playground structure was not well thought through. :(<//Review>

I loved the Olympic size pool and all other more shallow pools for those of us who are scared of deeper pools...alot of safeguards around, which is great...plenty of showers, changing and restrooms...Such a Great Swimming Facility in East Los Angeles, plus Night Swim 6pm -8pm for limited time</Text>

The young people at the front desk are kind of rude and not very experience with any kind of customer service or people training.
When you walk in to the building and the front window a girl ask me to lift my shirt so she can see if I was wearing a bathing suit I told her yes I do and she insisted and told me that she need it to see it, I was anoyed and so I show her a little piece of my bathing suit itbwas s one piece and then she insisted that I remove my top, I had to raise my voice 3 times so she could understand that this was a one piece bathing suit and I couldn't remove nothing.
then she ask my son to come closer so she can touch the fabric of his shorts when you can clearly see that it was swimming shorts then she ask us to hold so she can ask someone else if those shorts were okay.
Then we head to the restrooms to wash up and they were disgusting with toilet paper all over the floor so we didn't remove our sandals, then the same girl told us that we have to leave our sandals before entering, if they spect us to walk on that nasty floor they should at least clean it more often, outside the floor was really hot, we were all barefoot and I had to carry my daughter because she couldn't walk on the hot floor my sons had no choice than to run to the pool so they didn't burn their feet and one of the life guards told them not to run of course since they were wearing sandals they don't care about the children burning their feet.
But at least the pool was clean since they don't even alloy you to bring your own towel or even your purse, you have to leave it at the front desk then go and ask for it when you are ready to leave, and they are so lazy than if you left it on the right side window the person at the left would not get it for you you have to go around and ask for it on the right side because apparently a few steps extra for them is complicated.</text>

If you're bringing your kids to the playground, then get lots of sun screen as 99.9% of the playground is drench in UV light.The pool is clean but the life guards are yelling at kids for not following rules that they dont even mention at frist.The parking lot is so small that crashing is possible.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Hi / Hello, I'll give it five (5) stars because it's a nice park to hang out, bbq, chill, or relax. However, at night there's not enough lighting for the kids! Zero (0) stars for that issue, and also no restrooms in the late evening. Taco bell on Brooklyn & Atlantic are the closest restrooms. If ya'll got a case of the bubblies, your in danger 🤣 They have free swimming.
Five stars because the park is beautiful to spend the day and have fun. Roast a carnita or a little lady and the pool is free. But zero stars because at night there is not enough light for the hills and the baths will be sawn in the afternoon. Imagine. Well it ca. .

Cinco estrellas por que el parque esta bonito para pasar el dia y divertirse. Asar una carnita o una damita y la alberca es gratis. Pero cero estrellas por que en la noche no hay sufisiente luz para los morros y los baños lo sierran en la tarde. Imaginensen. Pues se ca. .</text>
