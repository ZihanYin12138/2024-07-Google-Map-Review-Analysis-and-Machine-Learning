The folks at Rush Tax are the best! I called for a individual problem with a couple tax years stacked up, which I had been afraid to tackle. Rush helped immediately by reaching out to the IRS on my behalf, and got a statement owing, and an abatement on the fees and penalties, effectively reducing my tax bill by 35%! BJ was incredibly helpful and never waited a moment for answer. DO NOT WAIT. Call these professionals today and get square with the IRS! Sleep easily. These folks are absolutely the BEST! Wish I would've called sooner!< /Text>

I am so happy with this company and I am happy we made the choice to go with them. Our girl is so thoughtful and takes the time to review everything I send her and answers my multiple calls a day to ask her questions when I do not understand. She wrote an offer in compromise for my husband and I and made no fuss when our income changed and she had to do it all over again. She has been patient with us since day one even when we did not respond for months due to personal reasons. Thank you very much.</Review>

I can't say enough about Ricky Goodman.  I was working with another tax service and felt like I wasn't  getting the right information.  I heard about Rush Tax Resolution and decided to reach out.  Ricky called me within the hour.  He gave me  information that the other company had withheld.  He double checked with the IRS to make sure the information he was giving me was correct and it was!  Thanks to Ricky an issue that my wife and I thought was major (according to the other company) was not an issue at all.  Thank you Ricky!< /review>

I phoned the people at Rush Tax Resolution and hung up when they answered the phone. They called me right back and I am glad they did. Crystal and her staff were the most professional, courteous, and efficient people to work with. Whenever I needed to know something they responded back immediately. They were very polite and a pleasure to work with. Thanks again to Crystal and her staff.< /Text>

After  several years of worsening medical conditions, I ended up over $100,000 behind on my state and federal taxes. I was assigned to Omar, and he has been wonderful. He explained my options and has constantly kept in communication with me about the progress of my tax resolution. It didn't happen overnight, but Omar has managed to negotiate a complete forgiveness of my federal taxes, and a very low payment I can afford on the state taxes. Having this gorilla off my back has given me huge relief and allowed me to concentrate on my medical needs. Thank you to all the staff at Rush Tax Resolution !!< /Review>

Omar Sanchez became our case manager and we could not have asked for a more dedicated person. Just talking to him makes you feel all is going to be well. Always promptly returning our calls, keeping us informed of the process on their end as well and giving us renewal hope.

This company saved me many troubles. My wife is still working but plans to retire soon and the IRS would not budge and help us settle placing levy's on our social security income. Luckily miss Hernandez jumped in and helped us get on a comfortable monthly payment and got those perky levy's removed. I am so pleased with her and having her call us to check in on us to see if we are okay even after the agreement was paced weeks ago.<//Text>

I am taking time to convey what a professional and solid communicator Shadi Halavi has been. I feel the stress of the IRS was overwhelming but as soon as she stepped in the stress was removed. We are still not finished yet but without her it would of been a complete mess and more than one person could bare. I personally am so appreciative of her efforts and the time she has been fighting on my behalf.

<Review>I was so grateful I called Rush Tax Resolution. I recently received a certified letter from the IRS. I called and spoke with Fred. He was able to resolved my Tax issue and get a reasonable payment plan with the IRS. Also, Fred was most helpful in working with me to pay for his services. No other company would have been able to resolved my issue in a few hours time frame. I most grateful to Fred and now able to sleep peacefully known my issue was resolved and I have no more Levy on my assets. I highly recommended anyone who has a Tax issue, please call Rush Tax Resolution you will be happy you did trust me. I am most thankful to Fred for help me. Thank you Fred!<//Review>< rating>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I contacted Rush Tax after hearing numerous commercials on the radio. I won't drag out my tax situation with a long story. In a nutshell I owed a little over $11k to the IRS. I spoke to a representative from Rush Tax who took down my information & told me he would look into it. About a day later, I received a call back with instructions on what to do. I followed those instructions and my debt was essentially GONE (it took about 3 months). That's right, all $11k GONE! I know everyone's tax situation is different but I'd DEFINITELY recommend Rush Tax as a place to start. I was also treated with courtesy & respect. Thanks again RUSH TAX😊<//Review>< pics>

<text>Can’t begin to thank Rush tax Resolution enough!! The state had garnished my wages for several years of back taxes that added up to $21,000 with penalties! I had heard about Rush on the Radio gave them a call. Rush Tax Resolution was straight up and clear with from the beginning and didn’t just tell me what I wanted to hear, the gave me sound advice. Within 1 week they negotiated a settlement down to $25 a month with the state and contacted my HR department to get my garnishment modified all for one flat fee that was much less than any of the other companies. It’s refreshing to know there are still companies who still try to help people and stand behind what they say.

I contacted Rush Tax Resolution (RTR) and Joe DePompeis evaluated my situation, my options and put me at ease. He further gave me guidance to improve my existing $50,000 payment plan to the IRS. RTR did not make promises or try to play games. It turns out that their help was not needed in my case. I would not hesitate to recommend them or ask for their help.
Thanks!<//review>

<review>I can't praise Rush Tax Resolution enough on how timely and positively they eased my anxiety and stress that I unfortunately created by not filing for ALOT of years.
Starting off with Joe P, my initial call went very well Joe explained all the scenarios I could have and in the end we came to an agreement that RTR would be able to assist in getting me out of my dilemma.
Jayson Chin - My Senior Tax Man, zipped through all the years needed per the IRS/State requirement and got it all done within DAYS to be able to file them and get the process going.
Stan S - my main guy. Very prompt on returning my emails and calls with all the questions that would arise. On average it was weekly emails or calls.  You are the best.
I felt very secure with the RTR team's assistance and response and final outcome!!  I got a huge refund.  I was told it would/could be a long as 8 mos. for resolution . .they completed and tracked it all within 2.5 mos.
Mahalo (thanks) RTR team . . I can finally rest well.</review><gmap_id>0x80c29e97f5233bc1:0x699674c2502b9b70</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

{'time': 1521249612047, 'text': 'Thank you - this is actually a great review, we only take cases that we know we can help, unlike many other firms.  All of our advertisements mention, call for a FREE consultation, and for a FREE IRS transcript analysis, to see if you qualify for this program.  We have never (unlike competitors) mislead a client and charged them to do a settlement case, when they may not qualify for one.  The IRS is never going to settle for less than 80% of your net assets - and we tell every caller this.  You have to be in a hardship situation in regards to having little to no disposable cash flow and little to no assets, to qualify for an Offer in Compromise settlement.  Any company that tells you otherwise, is trying to rip you off.\nFor people that do not qualify for this program, there are still many other benefits that we can do for them, including negotiating the lowest monthly payment plan possible, and often negotiating away some of the penalties, even at times placing the taxpayer in a currently not collectible status if appropriate.   The # 1 reason people hire us, is to protect all of the assets, and all of their income sources, from collection threats from the IRS or State, such as levies, garnishments, and liens.  The #2 reason, is that by hiring us, we do all the work to obtain the very best resolution possible - we get it all properly documented in writing - and they will never have to speak to the State or the IRS.'}<//response>

Rush Tax is a lifesaver!!!! I was scared to death when my boss called me into his office and told me that he had received an Earnings Withholding notice from the Franchise Tax Board. I'm a single mom and am the sole source of income for my daughter and I. For any of my wages to be withheld would have been devastating...especially right before Christmas!!! Joe at Rush tax was so kind and understanding and ONE DAY AFTER I called, my boss received a fax notice from the FTB that the Earnings Withholding had been cancelled!!!! Rush Tax was truly a Christmas miracle...thanks Joe!!!!<//text>

I was screwed by myself not being responsible & filing for 3yrs. I was finally to late & received the collection letter from IRS. Set into a panic i tried to go to some BLOCK place only to be turned away. So i googled RUSH taxes and was saved by Rush Tax Resolution! Fred explained thing to me & made me not feel so scared. Him and his team made it possible for me to finally be above water financially & get money back!.

I take all my dogs here for all their care. Routine to emergencies. I have been coming to Dr. Florence for a while now and he has become busier, which means limited availability less accommodating but that is okay. We completely understand.  So now I must book in advance, not like before. I think when writing reviews, we really must take everything into perspective. Some people write bad reviews because of their own faults and take no accountability and blame the establishment. Dr. Flores and his staff are not perfect, but I write this review because I genuinely appreciate them for the work they do and the dedication they have to it. They work hard to try and service everyone they could, but they are human; they have the same 24hrs that you and I have so they can only do so much.  I simply want to take a moment to commend them for their knowledge, their service, and their care. I value their honesty (they are always honest and realistic with me this which is hard for a pet parent to hear sometimes but I welcome it). I appreciate every single individual at Florence Vet. Dr. Flores you are a true blessing!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I've been to Florence Vet a couple of times. The doctor is very understanding  and truly cares cares about your pet. They did a fantastic tooth cleaning , on my little girl. She's the little one. Hours are a little different, as they open in the evenings. The staff at the office is knowledgeable and makes every effort to accommodate  your needs. They practice covid-19 protocol, to help keep everyone safe.</Review>

<Review>I highly recommend this vet hospital, the staff is caring and very friendly. Dr Flores took such good care of our lab Jake when he needed emergency surgery, he went above and beyond to make sure Jake was well taken care of. Dr Flores is an amazing Dr. who is very passionate in taking care of fur babies, always explains everything thoroughly and his prices are extremely reasonable. It is because of Dr. Flores and his staff that we have Jake home, healthy and happy and will be able to celebrate his 12th birthday in a few weeks!< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgbUONR8l0i1iwgYsPX8X5pO9bMAQMpX0H13A3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

Went to take my cat Mila to this vet for the 1st time on Monday. Staff is friendly. Dr Flores was awesome, friendly and was gentle with my cat in which she really liked him too. She went for vaccines, don't know a lot of vets in town and heard about this one thru reviews and nextdoor so thought we would give it a shot. Overall really great experience and they open late is even better for us people who have to commute to work everyday and don't get home till after 5pm or so. Absolute a plus! Will be back again.<//Review>

<Text>Took 2 kittens to Dr. Flores off a recommendation from my mother who liked him. Staff was helpful and efficient. Office smelled very clean. He was quick with the exams but talkative and thorough. Vaccines were administered and cats seemed comfortable during the whole procedure. What I liked best was him allowing my children to listen to the heartbeats of the kittens. I appreciated him including them in the exam. My children really liked him. Thank you so much to the doctor and staff.</Text>< UserId.>

< Review>
I took in my puppy mushroom after she had been in an accident and throwing up for a week. Sadly I could not afford to take her immediately, but the plan was to take her as soon as possible. I took her here, and met the vet. He was a super nice man, who educated me, and treated my pup. Prescribed my pup for her wounds and medicine for her internal ulcer. Overall great experience. If your looking for a vet, I highly recommended. I can’t thank him enough. Mushroom is now doing so much better.<3<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Los Banos is very fortunate to have Dr. Flores and his team serving the veterinary needs of his patients, clients and community. Trust, integrity and caring, for your four legged furry family members is what Dr. Jaime and his team are all about. They are true advocates of strengthening the human-animal bonds, for those that cross the threshold of Florence Veterinary Hospital. They care about you and your pet and are open and honest about it. The icing on the cake is that Dr. Flores has 30 years of experience with pets and people and humbly treats both parties with respect and honesty.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>My pup Tito wasn't feeling well, got to his office, but not knowing I needed to make an appointment, the doctor took him in until he had time between appointments to care for him. Thank you Dr. and to your team for taking care of my Tito.< /text>< rating>

<Date>1577766743060< /Date><Text>Very nice Doctor & Staff. Really priced under reasonable, in other words he's not in it just for money but his passion & live to treating animals!! 💖💓
For example my mother took her dog to Menefee's for his teeth. The first day they charged $55 for an exam recommend his teeth needed to be pulled cost between $300-$500 but not more than $500. In the end it was $695 because it was more complicated then they thought? No antibiotics were given for pain or infection. We went to Mr Flores & his dental extraction was nothing more than $300 w/antibiotics & a follow up included!! I couldn't believe it!!!!
He is a must see Vet Doctor you won't be sorry I PROMISE!!!!😁 TELL him SHADOW sent you!!<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>My family pup was handled horribly by Dr. Florence
She was being choked right in front of our eyes. After telling the doctor “hey you’re choking her give her to me!” He basically threw her back at us, still by her neck. We were then kicked out just because we raised our voice to tell him to let go of her! Who wouldn’t do so though?! When getting home, she’s been aggressive and shaking which isn’t usual. I have filed a claim against them and will NEVER return. Disgusting! Why be a veterinarian when you can’t even handle animals?</review>< Pictures>

<user>102882877820539350159<//user><Text>Amazing vet, reliable doesn't overcharge and knows what he's doing. Took 3 dogs, 2  cats and a bird.  Based my experience with the local vets, and transferring to Merced because of poor treatment, to get more unneeded treatment, and fees that are rediculous.
Finally an honest, educated vet who cares for your pet. 💯 💯<//Text>< gmap_id>

They even provide free coffee while you wash, which is a nice perk 😊. There's a small playground right beside the parkinglot so you can accompany your children while your clothes are washing and drying. The downsides are you can't dry unless you wash, and that sundays it's really PACKED and the parking lots also get really full this day. Other than that it's a nice place to get your laundry done!<//Text><resp>None< /resp>< user>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>My family and I went here for many years and I ran into one person after the next within staff at this church that truly did not exemplify Jesus in any way, what so ever. Also the high school ministry is very clicky even amongst the leaders. This church ultimately caused my child to question their faith. I would definitely not recommend this church.</Review>< pictures>

I wish they would advocate 2 Corinthians 9:7, giving with a cheerful heart not reluctantly and not under compulsion, as a model of giving.< /review>< Pictures>

Great church. I have been attending for only a few weeks since deciding to attend church again and I am absolutely thrilled that a passing acquaintance (never met before) recommended Cornerstone. The staff and message(s) has been top-notch. I even joined my first small group and again, am absolutely thrilled. I have brought my two-year old daughter the last two weekends and she, too, loves going. Praise God for the passing recommendation.< /Review>

< review>
I started here a few years ago. I came to church and was immediately welcomed into a group of ladies. They didn't even know me.
For the last seven years it has been a very loving and safe place I can go to for friendship and help or to give help when needed.
UPDATE: They have changed greatly. No longer teaching Bible based stuff. No longer serving the elderly people of the community. In fact, they pretty much kicked them out of the church by making them feel unwelcome.  We left in January 2020 after the pastor preached that we were bad because of our race. He twisted the bible to fit his purpose. Sad really. Teaching wokeness and not the bible.< /review>

<text>Great place to worship and feel God's presence, the teaching is amazing, great doctrine, they are very transparent in everything they do (including finances) child care is outstanding, different youth ages have their own service. As big as the church is they always welcome you to serve, you are always encouraged to do so whether is in worship, teaching,  serving, etc..< /text><Response>None</Response><rate>5<//rate><name>Jonathan J Pinos< /name>< GmapID>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>@Jennie Douglas, I for one absolutely Love this church and I've been going there for about 2 years now (on/off, because of school) and thanks to a friend of a mine once who showed this church to me one day, so I stuck around.

But I have a feeling I know what you mean about the person who wrote the bad reviews where I feel like they don't completely understand what this church tries to express because it is multiple things and I have a feeling that 1 of them is enhancing spiritual growth where that person might not possibly be spiritual. And this church does talk about different portions within the bible, but to me, it also sounds like the person might think that everything should be lived by the bible, but that's not true because not everything has to be lived by the bible all the time.

I totally understand some people do live by the bible all the time, but they don't have to, but they choose to and not always, but it can be understandable at times. In my opinion, if you have an iPhone, a good Bible app is the King James version (ERV which is the easy-to-read) version. There's also ASV which is American Standard Version which can be confusing at times, but it's most similar to what's in the Bible they read from at this church.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

This church is a gorgeous place of fellowship, it offers tremendous open spaces of travertine and marble. Not only is it gorgeous, but it stays so naturally cool. Kudos to the designer and architect!<//text>

If you're looking for a church, really pray about it and give it a good honest go. I saw a few bad reviews on here but sadly, they look like they are from the same person who made up different accounts. Don't judge on just reviews. Give the church you're looking into an honest try and pray, pray,pray. :)<//review><Name>Buckeye Girl<//Name><Rating>5</Rating>< userid>

not sure about the 17 list that Toni mentions  as Eph 5:23 doesn't state Jesus' name be in a church name?  it says:'   Ephesians 5:23New King James Version (NKJV)

23 For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body.

But whatever one writes I guess makes it right NOT!
I attend this church and it is Biblically based, God loving church who welcomes people with open arms and unjudgemental.  I love the kids program and Pastor Steve is such a blessing.  God has provided him such a talent and the ability to speak to so many different people, cultures etc and still God is working in this church (obviously as by the growth and people coming to Him everyday).< /text>

<text>Dr Najafi and her team are amazing. I had treatment here several times over the years.

<Review>Friendly faces and quick service! I was referred here due to the service and was not disappointed. I went into the office to receive a consult for an implant and I was pleasantly surprised by how fast it was. I honestly have never received such fast service at any office. I was scanned within minutes of my arrival and was scheduled to come back after the doctor did a thorough review for treatment. The receptionist was super sweet and so was the dental assistant who scanned me. I had to come back to get copies of my scans and they had no problem providing me with those. Anyways, all in all, great dental office.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Text>Friendly staff, wait times are reasonable most of the time.  However, they will try to charge you for things that should be covered by insurance.  For example, I needed a crown and they charged me $850.  I needed it asap so I paid.  Later I called my insurance and asked why I was charged when crowns are covered, they told me this business entered some odd office visit code x 4 times (not covered) instead of any of the crown codes which would have been covered.  My insurance gave me a list of the covered codes.  Also, even though your insurance will cover usually 2 cleanings a year, they will purposely schedule a "perio maintenance" cleaning which is not covered and charge you $80 for it.  And you never get the free "basic" cleanings.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<text>Im 28 and have never been to the dentist. Mostly out of an irrational fear I had as a child that I never really got over as an adult.... But I started h aving pain in my tooth. A friend of mine who also has a fear of the dentist recommended Dr. Park. And I figured i have to go... Might as well give them a shot.

I am so glad I did! All the staff there were friendly and helpful and answered all my questions (and I am one to ask a-lot of questions.) And Unfortunately I have to have a root canal.... But Dr. Park and her assistant Kesia were just so amazing! They explained everything to me ahead of time and anytime they did anything they let me know so I was ready for it.

They made sure that I didnt feel anything before starting the procedure and let me know with my hands if i felt any pain so they could stop. I opted for the nitrous option to help me relax. And I must say, while laying down with my eyes shut.... I was so relaxed and comfortable that I could feel myself falling asleep!

I will definitely be going back here as long as Dr.Park is here!< /text>< date>

<Review>Orthodontic department: Very poor administrative job...... it's ridiculous! First, they never call back! Never! I'm still waiting for my orthodontic financial plan since the end of December! It's incredible. Every time I called them they told me they will check the price and send it to me. When my husband went there in person they were extremely rude and said that they are too busy right now and they will do it on next week!?!?  The most unresponsive person is Megan! Never call back and very arrogant! I'm sick and tired of it! Despite doctor's professionalism there is no reasons to treat there! You will have a lot of problems with them!
Dental department: they called me back only once out of 10 times maybe, they can not even properly check my insurance plan and overcharged me!<//Review>< GmapID>

Wonderful staff! I went to another dental office that told me I had a cavity in-between my front teeth, only to come here and find out that it was fine, just needed extra flossing. They are trustworthy and truly care about your health.<//text>

Everyone was very welcoming, my first visit I was so nervous, I went in for an emergency during this covid craziness, I needed a root canal and crown (eek!) but Dr. Nguyen and his assistant Marleen were awesome. It's the most comfortable I've ever felt at a dentists office! They also have really awesome equipment I've never seen before, I was very impressed. A friend of mine recommended Anaheim Hills Dental and I'm so glad I went!</text>

<Review>Dental office is clean and friendly but you will constantly be up charged. My husband had an appointment today and after he waited for over an hour to go back they didnt even bother cleaning his teeth which is a basic service covered by our insurance. Instead all they did was perform an exam and tell us he needs 2 crowns and a deep cleaning that needed to be performed by a different kind of hygienist. When I called the receptionist to see what happened she said most adults need a deeper cleaning not covered by insurance so this seems to be their mod of operation. Previously he had to come back 6 times to have a root canal done properly and install a crown. The dentist did a poor job at a partial root canal and he ended up getting an infection and walked out paying $$$.< /Review>< Pictures>

Fantastic office.  Kind, smart, dedicated.  I was in so much pain and Brooke got me in right away and worked with my insurance to be sure I was covered and Dr Hyashi was gentle and talented and made me so happy that I was referred to this office.  My root canal went perfect and in a few days, I was out of pain.  This is a great service and I really appreciate them.</text>

I just called on 7/9/2020 at 8:50am and spoke to a receptionist, I had an appointment at 8:30 and unfortunately missed my appointment I meant to reschedule my appointment because I am 6 months pregnant and was at my prenatal checkup, but i honestly forgot (pregnancy brain) I called to reschedule and the receptionist was absolutely rude from the beginning I could tell she was irritated because I missed and an appointment that someone else could have had to see a dentist and she explained that next time there will be a charge and then went off about how because of coronavirus people have been backed up 4 months on appointments and someone could have taken that appointment...I understand where she was coming from but she was just plain rude all I wanted to do was reschedule my cleaning unfortunately because of the coronavirus I haven’t been able to get a cleaning since I’ve been pregnant so I understand that appointments are backed up and all I wanted to do was just reschedule she then went on and said if I don’t show up next time there will be a charge I was like okay that’s fine what do you have available and she said September,October and I said okay( I’m due in October) I can do September and she said I have 11am and I asked if she had anything later and then added next time just say you want something in the afternoon by that time I heard enough of her Attitude I told her I did not want the appointment and I will just find another dentist. Seriously can’t believe that with everything going on people still find in them to be this rude over the phone like all I wanted to do was reschedule but now I’ll just have to look for another dentist and place to go. Should I have rescheduled before my appointment? Absolutely. But she should have been more respectfulI am disgusted with the customer service over the phone and just disappointed.< /text>

<text>Went in for a crown and they took forever.  Hours and hours to get it to fit and feel authentic.  It never did quite feel right and now a year later another dentist says it was not a good job and should be redone.  Starting to feel sensitivity around the tooth again and afraid I will need a root canal.  Moved out of state and based on these other reviews I'm not going to even try to get anything back from them, not that I would anyway.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Rating>1< /Rating><Response>None<//Response>< username>

Dr. Najafi is always so gentle with any type of treatment I receive. I just recently finished my orthodontics with Dr. Daryabegi and I’m extremely satisfied with my smile.

This place is really clean and friendly. Everyone is very nice and patient. Never really had any problems here. They decided to make Dr. Pandhoh my primary. I had to get a crown on my tooth which was scary for me but she made it fun and relatively painless. She was assisted by Kesia who was also very kind and capable. I go to this office for all my dental needs cause I just really love it.</review>

Hands down the best experience I've ever had at a dental office. As a kid I grew up with nothing but bad experiences from dentists, either they'd miss the nerve and would disregard my pain, or the operations would take hours, or even some offices that worked so fast they never bothered to check the quality of their work. I've gone in twice for operations now and both times were pretty much as pleasant as you could hope for at a dentist, which for me was an amazing surprise.

I had Dr. Najafi both times and she's just the best, she talks you through the process, tells you what certain drills are going to feel and sound like, and she will DEFINITELY notice if you're feeling anything. Even when I was fully numb and twitched a little (maybe from the sound?) she stopped to see if I was okay.

My dental assistant was Patty for my first operation and Gloria for my second and they were both so wonderful and kind. I honestly couldn't ask for a better experience or team of people working on my mouth. I don't have to worry about getting stomach aches or the shakes from the thought or act of going into the dentist's office. You can't put a price on that.</review>

I was very nervous about coming to the dentist again after having not been in for a couple years, but Dr. Lai and her team were amazing!  They worked with me to get my teeth back in good shape and now everything feels great =D.  I'm so thankful that I decided to come here.  I would definitely recommend this office.</review>

I had an amazing experience at this dental office! The front staff, doctors, and hygienist were very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. I was seen within a few mins of my arrival by the doctor. I never see a doctor that soon! I had a few fillings done and didn’t pay a dime. I must have great insurance! Anaheim Hills Dental Group is fantastic!<//text>

1st of all, why is the "owner" only replying to 5 star reviews?  Why not respond to the dissatisfied consumer?  Well, at least they are being transparent...

My initial experience was different than any other dental office visit.  Am I paying for bells and whistles or for simple dentistry at its best, I felt like was purchasing a car... I'm not kidding!  I cancelled my follow-up appointment (I immediately ran back to my old dentist - again, not kidding).  I did state (over the phone) to the dental office associate that I would not be rescheduling for the initial work, but would call back to schedule a visit with the oral surgeon.  She was immediately no longer interested in what I was saying, she cut me off multiple times - I actually thought she was talking to someone there in the office with the way she was cutting me off, but no she wasn't.  The lack of customer service in this facility is reason to look elsewhere , they don't care about you - they care only about how much $ they can acquire from you.  Sadly disappointed...< /Text>

< Review>
RIP OFF ARTISTS!
Do not let your teenage kids go here unattended. THEY TRY TO UPSELL and don't tell you that you have options that are completely covered by your insurance company. Criminal activity in my opinion!
My 19 year old daughter went here and they told her she needed a mouth guard (which she did not need-they try to sell this to everyone). To add insult to injury, they told her she needed a mouth guard that cost over $275 instead of the one that insurance covered for $85. Then they told her she need the more expensive fluoride treatment that they could charge $25 more for instead of the one that was covered 100% by insurance. They never told my daughter that there were less expensive options or completely free options! HARD SELL TACTICS - THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TEENAGERS that haven't had experience saying no to con artists like this!!!! HORRIBLE....DO NOT GO HERE.
I requested a refund and filed a complaint with my Insurance carrier...8 months later all they did was credit $25 back. I asked for a credit of $215 because of the up-charges on the mouth guard and fluoride...what an insult!!!<//Review>

<Text>I love them! I know everyone has a right to their own opinions and every situation is different, but I have a hard time believing the bad experience reviews here. This office and Mr Wu and staff are amazing!! First off, Anaheim Hills is a community of very successful people and they would not keep a bad business thriving by going there if those bad reviews were true. From the time you start your visit you are given documentation, including prices, of the visit. They are upfront and definitely check your insurance before you even get there, very on it! Now for the treatment, Dr. Wu is my favorite of all time. He greeted me my first time and even walked me out making sure the treatment was successfully communicated to the front staff. He is Master of dentistry, btw. He took a ugly bad tooth and made it look even better then my original tooth, haha. I did have some sensitivity, but only due to myself failing to report that a tooth was too high after the filling was placed. Of course I thought the worse about the situation, but they made a quick adjustment and all was well. Also, I purchased a mouth guard, I am a grinder, and they made all the adjustments needed to make the mouthgaurd fit like a glove, literally. I woke up this morning forgetting it was in and left outside with it in my mouth to run a quick errand. Lol I am sooo beyond happy with this practice. I am usually super scared of the dentist and very weary because I was ripped off by a dentist before, but they held their game. I was also very scared to visit here because of the nasty reviews, so please disregard those saying anything other then they are the best. I am sure all the doctors here are great, but Dr. Wu is certainly the man! I also recommend Rudy and the hygienist, both very skilled and informative. Thank you guys, just love you peeps!< /Text>< UserId.>

My best advice is to stay away from this location, I had my wisdom teeth pulled all 4 at once, and they did get me in quick which was nice, but that stops there. They wanted to take one extra tooth out along with the 4 wisdom teeth, and after I got 3 different reasons why, one including the tooth will fall apart once the wisdom teeth are out I did not have them extract it. I can tell you now one month later the tooth has not fallen out and I don’t have a problem there. What I do have a problem is I have been in severe pain until just last week. My lower jaw and gums where my wisdom teeth had been take out was in so much pain I missed many days of work just staying home taking pain killers ans passing out from the pain. I tried and my sister also tried calling them to ask what is going on please call us back we got no reply. The first time I called they would not offer me an appointment in the afternoon time since I missed so much work already I was not able to miss any more work to go in the morning, they could only offer me time in the morning and stated there is no afternoon appointments for the time being. I advised them I was getting a second opinion from a different office which I did, and I will save you the bad details, but again you need to stay away from this office. I am not saying they do this for everyone, but at least for me I can see they don’t care about me even to do a simple call back, or help you in emergency pain situation. Also they are way overpriced even after draining my insurance.</Review>

Had a bridge made and was told my copay would be $2850.00, which I paid. I felt like it was very high, so I called my insurance company to find out my copay. They informed me the copay should have been no more than $800.00. I immediately went back and spoke with the manager who said he would take care of it and get back to me right away. That was three months ago. My insurance tells me Anaheim Hills dental has never filed a complete claim and refuses to furnish the paperwork required. They also tell me that AHD has told them that I have paid in full and nothing is owed by the insurance. I am filing a complaint with the insurance company, which will investigate AHD.< /Text>

Dr. Charshafjian is very caring about the patient and making sure the work is done correctly. She did such an amazing job with my onlay. I would recommend her any day.<//Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Horrible! They pretended to have checked my insurance coverage and told me that my insurance acted as a discount card not an insurance so a root canal and single bridge would be $1895.00??? They were going to charge me for the first visit etc. ...so I put my husband on the phone with Kevin, the finance guy,  to review our ACTUAL insurance coverage.  My husband recited each cited procedure and. ... A porcelain bridge should be $89! And NO CHARGE for the consultation visit. They were unwilling to go over other options to get the bill down even though the dental assistant that was doing the cleaning whispered to me that there are cheaper options for the bridge if I pressed the issue.  They don't care for the patient, they care about the money they think our community has to throw around</text><name>Nikki Cilantra</name>< Date>

This office misrepresented the necessity of services and up sold my wife on costly additions to her visit. If you're looking for the same experience offered by car salesman while having your teeth cleaned I would highly recommend this place! If being taken advantage of is not very high on your list of favorite sensations however, I would urge you to take your business elsewhere.<//Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>They are not even deserve this one star i gave it to them , they should shut down this facility which they claim that a dental group office and open an Auto repair instead ..
Couple months ago , they extracted my teeth after many times trying to save it by filling instead of extraction , and everytime falls , and then they suggested to pull it out after costing me a lot ..
If you guys do not know how to do you work i a right way , then better for you and us to go back to school and study from the beginning the basics of dentistry.
Stay away of these clowns.</Review>< Pictures>

My fiancé got a crown done at another office and it fell off over 4 times so he did not got back. He made an appt. with Dr. Najafi at Anaheim hills dental and not only did he have a great experience, his crown was made that day and he was out the door after  2 quick hours. His crown has stayed on and he felt great even after the numbness was gone. If you want quality work I highly recommend this office.< /text>< Pics>

Absolute WORST dental office! I had to pay for a crown for my daughter $600.00 plus everything else, a year later another dentist said the cavity was still there. When I called back all I got was the run around that it was not their fault. It has been 3.5 years and I still need to get this fixed but this dental group WILL NOT STAND BY THEIR WORK! Another dentist sees the same defect in this dental offices work. Thank goodness it doesn't bother my daughter, but now I am looking at possibly a root canal and a NEW CROWN!
STAY AWAY! STAY FAR AWAY, THEY DO NOT CARE AT ALL ALL THEY WANT IS THE MONEY!  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE AND DENTISTRY!< /review>

<text>It's ok.  The food left MUCH to be desired.  I had higher hopes for this place than received. The "Burrata" which is a cheese not a dish as they named it was lacking flavor entirely. The "truffle garlic" fries also not very good really lacking any of the flavors they described at all. However, the wine was excellent and the service was pretty good. The cheesecake was a great idea.  Not sure they made it in house. I think not so much. But you never know. I'll go back and hope it was just a bad night.< /text>< Resp>

I don't drink, so I've driven past Veritas for quite awhile thinking there was nothing to offer me here. I was wrong. The Taco Trio was delicious and I'll stop by again to venture through the menu. I don't drink, but I enjoy good food. Thanks.<//text>

This place is classy and I like it. The staff is super sweet, great tapas, great wines. It gets loud with wine, women, laughter and no sound proofing ;-). You gotta check ot out, it's a sweet vibe.<//text>

<Text>This may be a new favorite place when I visit Tehachapi. Great location, easily accessible even with all the road work going on (summer 2019). The atmosphere, presentation, taste, plate sizes were perfect, especially with the great service. The wine selection and food menu covered a delicious range while not being overwhelming with a cacophony of options.<//Text>< resp>

<Review>Nice place to try a variety of wine (good selection of beer too), excellent service and a nice selection of light food options,  had the cheese platter and it was absolutely delicious and more than enough for 2. Would also recommend their stuffed portabella and stuffed Anaheim pepper,  have always enjoyed our evening's out at Veritas.</Review><GmapID>0x80c1f7ebfa9a83bb:0xab59d0c9f1a3c981< /GmapID>< user_name>

Nice wine spot if you're passing thru Tehachapi or Mohave. I had a nice Cabernet Sauvignon.  You can get a half or full pour. Get the full pour it's a better value! They have a nice selection of wine many from California they also have a few international wines Chile, Italy, France. They also serve beer too, mostly artisan varieties. They have a pretty decent menu for food options salads, meat and cheese plates, pizza, and so much more. I had a flat bread pizza it was delicious. The salmon salad looked delicious! The chef used fresh ingredients! The don't allow children so leave the kiddos at home. They have nice bar seating or tables they even have a lounge area with comfy chairs and couches. This place is a little gem tucked in the middle of nowhere California.

Oh and you can take a bottle for the road if you like it.<//review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>This place is alright for the location it is in. There is really no need for them to keep it up to par because it is a small town with hardly any visitors. When I asked them about their wines, they didn't know anything about them. They didn't know about smelling the cork is just something you see on TV (Really you inspect it for cracks that may have let air sink in the bottle and spoil the wine.), they didn't know about the rainbow colors in the wine while tilting the glass or or what is means, they didn't even know why people swash the wine in the glass and inhale the aroma! They don't know about what makes some wine better then others.. NOTHING! The cheeses are okay but if you know anything about cheese or wine, this place is not for you. The service is awful, waited 3 hours for the check after constantly reminding them. I mean, there were 5 workers and only 7 customers. How can they be that bad. The woman who owns it does not train her staff and believes that if she keeps cute young females there, then it will keep the place running... well, that is true. It may keep the place running, but it will never make it successful.  Oh, and also my waitress got mad at me and even yelled at me because I asked her about the spider legs on the two wines and she didn't know what that was. She looked at me and yelled "ARE YOU CALLING ME OUT!" I just looked at her confused and my date was shocked and jumped up to run about. I asked her why she did that, she said she was so scared by how angry the waitress reacted, she thought she was going to start a fight.  Stay classy Wine and cheese cellar that has no name.. stay classy..<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

We have been coming here for years, and Veritas is especially fantastic since the present owners purchased the wine bar. The atmosphere is  lovely and welcoming, the food is delicious, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about their wine. We travel all over, and Veritas is a stand alone all the way through!  A great value for a reasonably priced menu.  Thank you Veritas!!!
Ps it is hard to leave when all new and old friends are around.</Review>

< review>
Overall, this restaurant is a great place for lunch or dinner. The decor is modern with really warm colors. The only thing off-putting about this place is the mural over the bar... couldn't look away from the absurd garishness of that wall. The food was delicious but beware if you are on a date because everything is heavily cooked with garlic. We ordered flatbread with chimichurri sauce which was delicious but completely covered in garlic served with garlic oil. I ordered the chicken sandwich which had a delicate sliced chicken breast with tomatoes, lettuce, guacamole spread, and lots of garlic (raw and spread on the bread). My husband ordered the tri tip grilled cheese sandwich. It was yummy, gooey and buttery. Good thing we shared our sandwiches because the tri tip was so rich, it would be hard to eat a whole one! Lastly, my husband tried the icecream with port. It was more like a port float because there was so much port in the glass, it was overwhelming. By the end of the meal, my taste buds were destroyed from the heavy use of garlic and had bad breath the rest of the day. Service was good and there was even a live clarinet player to set the mood. We'll be back to try more items off the menu!< /review>

Packed place and one server who was also the bartender.  One.  Rediculous.  She tried hard but impossible to handle.  Eventually another gal showed up complete with attitude.  Not an improvement.<//text>

<Review>This "public service department" seriously needs to be torn completely down and rebuilt from scratch because, let me tell you, the current form of "operations" is absolutely useless in its context to unemployed, tax-paying Americans. It is undeniably clear by now that these people couldn't care less if the poor quality of their' collective performance puts us out on the street in destitution.  Absolute joke.< /Review>< time>

< Review>
I have never been able to get someone on the phone. Last time I was on hold for 40 minutes just to be hung up on. They are unreliable at best and negligent at worst and it is a shame that such an essential and necessary service runs so poorly and unreliably. There is conflicting information on the website and the representatives are never available. Dealing with Ca EDD is a massive headache and inconvenience every time I need to deal with them.</Review>

I have served my country as a Marine and don't want anything more than a little help and compassion. Edd if you ever read your comments hire people that want to work and have some sort of experience in dealing with people. Not people who don't care and answer the phone with attitude. I haven't had a check in 6 weeks. Everyone I have spoken to at Edd says something different.  They system says it  has sufficiently ramped up to help those in need,  that's a lie. When you have to wait hours to talk to someone who is rude and then tells you to wait the system is trying to catch up, there is a problem waiting to get paid to feed your family and pay you bills no company wants to hear that.  I wish the state would jump in and hire more people till this issue is fixed.< /text></record>

Very rude people. They don't even pick up the phone or hangup when they see you calling back. Worst customer service.<//text>

I have hope. I have been waiting for payment or something in the mail since April. I have tried calling both EDD 800 and 833 number and they can never take your call try again later and I understand how busy they are. I have no phone no money no nothing. I have hope now a very nice young man said he would give it a try and see if someone can call me back on my boyfriends phone...Thank you nice person that answered the phone.</text>

+ Only street metered parking, but it's not hard to find availability
+ Great menu with a huge selection
+ MUST GET: Salt & Pepper Pork Chop Rice Plate. SO GOOD HERE.
+ Their pan fried noodle is okay. I ordered the Tomato Beef Pan Fried Noodle and while good, I still prefer it at Wong's Cafe better.
+ Service is friendly and easy. I was able to place my phone-in order without any problems (Sometimes there can be a language barrier which makes it hard).< /Review>

Salty fish chicken fried rice & lemon chicken this 2 items price at $19.00 is what i usually order when Im in the mood  for this type of food this is quite a satisfying meal as ths portion they give is pack well enough that you will have so much leftover the next day or 2 if its just you. Very generous take out portion each and every order I place is always consistent with them.<//Text>

This place is by all means a dive. Also, I cannot speak of the other foods but this place has the best calamari ever. My sister prefers the regular deep-fried calamari but I prefer the salted calamari. I have been going here for years and I continue to order the calamari as a party plate for bringing to parties.</review>

<response>None< /response><Text>Sully's Cafe is an ok place to eat, as the price is reasonable compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood. The food is full of MSG and makes you thirsty after eating. The ambiance is not conducive and the hot sauce containers looks unpleasant.  The service is poor because the server has an attitude towards the customer.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808f7c0d06b48a8b:0x9b82ce8c09723d69< /Gmap_id><username>Emmanuel C Javier< /username><rating>3</rating><pictures>None</pictures><UserId.>113756944221515231790<//UserId.></record>

I always enjoy the food here. I feel like I order here once or twice a month and can never complain about the food. I particularly love their salt and pepper chicken and pork, love the house special chow mein and fried rice, and the cod fish is pretty good. I have eaten at the location a few times and the place is fairly small. So I tend to order for pick up most of the time. And I can say they are always reliable to have my order ready very quickly and the staff is very sweet.<//Text>

Decided to try this place out on a Sunday. It was busy with a lot of take out orders and phone orders. We sat in. We got tomato beef pan fried noodle, beef and aspargus rice plate, broccoli with filet rock cod rice plate, salt n pepper pork chop rice plate. They were all very delicious. My favorite was the broccoli with filet rock cod. So glad we went here! Would definitely go again and would recommend! Also they only take cash. Also if you are Americanized or are only used to Americanized Chinese food (Panda Express), you won't be used to places like these and may have culture shock.</Text>

Since then, my boyfriend, daughter, and myself would come to Daly City just to eat at Suily's Cafe (we live in Fremont) for lunch or to order some Salt and Pepper chicken. Though the restaurant is a bit small, the food and service makes up for it; delicious dishes that is served very quickly, and the gentleman who served is very nice.  The prices for the dishes are reasonable as well,< /Review>

If you go close to meal times, be prepared to wait. Call ahead for take out. It looks like a hole in the wall, but the food is good. The sweet and sour chicken is really good - not heavily breaded and very crispy with good sauce. Both beef with broccoli and chicken with broccoli are good, with plenty of meat and the sauces are different enough you can eat both in a single meal. The Singapore noodles are kind of a sweet curry rather than a spicy one. The stir fried string beans have heat from jalapenos, and are tasty. We enjoyed the black pepper beef, and the king pao chicken was very good. We will be going back.<//text>

Cheap decent Chinese food.

Had a quick lunch stop over here before we headed for our short hike. There are metered parking lots along the road, fairly easy to get one during weekend lunch hour.

The shop is very dated and simple. One area which I dropped a star was due to the smell and ambience of this place. For the price I'm not expecting posh seats but it's never nice to walk in a restaurant that smells oily and musky. It the kind of place where you will walk out smelling like the restaurant.

We ordered a BBQ pork wanton soup and a beef Chow Fun. The BBQ pork wanton soup was disappointing, the wanton tasted bland and the pork tasted odd. The soup tasted alright.

The beef chow fun was good. The taste was great except that it's extremely oily. We continued eating but really felt guilty after gobbling them down.

The portions are fairly huge. They serve complimentary tea when you dine in the restaurant. For the two items we ordered, it was a total of $14!

For the price, you can't complain all that much.

Overall, a highly affordable decent Chinese food place.<//Text>

<text>Very few places where you can get an excellent Chinese dinner for two under $20, especially in the Bay Area. This place offers big plates with excellent beef and excellent Seafood, served with generous amounts of steamed rice and complimentary tea that's just delicious.

It's *absolutely* a five star as for a Cafe.

No fancy dish, no secret ingredient, almost nothing would get any food critic's attention; however, this is the place if you were looking for simple robust and solid Hong Kong style American Chinese food. The ingredients are simple, serving and service are robust, and the Hong Kong street vendor taste is solid - with the signature Wok texture/taste.

做一事，成一業。小本經營，不做大菜。
不賣清蒸，不賣蝦蟹，就賣港式(大)排檔“鑊”味。

簡單，樸實，好味道。< /text>

< Review>
I have been going here for twenty five years .You could spend 20 times more money and not get as good as the food here. Anyone who knows how to order at a Chinese restaurant knows you order your food not from a menu but from the wall. On the walls are pieces of paper that briefly describe a dish Let's say Rock Cod fillet with black bean .if you don't want black bean you order Rock Cod fillet with ginger and green onions. If you are at a loss for words you ask the only waiter at Suily's what you could get instead of black bean with your Rock Cod .your fillet will not have  inches of breading on it just fillet and your choice of sauce. Their fried flounder the best I've ever had.. they have gai lan  pork and beef  all cooked to your order in a wok five feet from your table at a half open kitchen .it's a small place but I'd rather go there than any other place in San Francisco. There is no decor other than clean simple and I only have eyes for the food.<//Review>

The food is AWESOME here. Inexpensive too. Please note they only take cash. This place is like one of them holes in the wall places. Shrimp fried rice, egg fu yong and beef with oyster sauce is what I always order here<//text>

Some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten and extremely affordable. I'd just like to c the staff smile more and not look at me like I'm from another planet when I request that they put gravy directly over my rice.🤣 other than that their the best.<//Text>

I ordered sweet n sour chicken.
Arrived at my house.
They decided to substitute just RICE.

I took it back.
He looked at it.

AND FEKKIN WENT BACK TO DEALING WITH OTHER ORDERS.

I GOT NO REPLACEMENT.
SO I WALKED OUT.

I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.

this was the fifth time they screwed up my order.</Text>

Tried to order the Chefs dinner at 12.75. But you have to buy 2 chef dinners at that price or else they won't honor it.< /text>

<Review>Don’t judge a book by it’s cover! The place is shady but the food is delicious. Ordered egg rolls, chicken fried rice, orange chicken, broccoli beef and the house chow mien. It was all cooked to order so there was a little wait. It’s best to call ahead as there wasn’t any inside access only drive thru.< /Review>< pictures>

Very close to traditional Asian cuisine. They offer most plates non spicy, mild, or spicy. Several chicken, beef, vegetarian, and seafood choices. It doesn't look like much from the outside but definitely food worth eating with great service and very affordable prices. They also offer great lunch specials and family sized portions.<//Review>< Pictures>

Food was great.

The place looks sketchy outside but inside its pretty cozy. And food is like home made, traditional chinese.

All in all, everything is great. Less 1 star for the way the owner took our order.</text>

I love this place! It's so cozy and the owner is very nice, normally I know what I want but thanks to them I got spicy rice(never knew I ckuld do that). There is a clock (not sure if it is a grandmother or grandfather) thats beautiful. I regret doing a to-go order because there was so much artwork and beautiful plants to look at. Definately will come back here!<//review>

I highly recommend Fortune Bowl looking to eat eat healthy Chinese food.
All the chicken is chicken bread unless otherwise stated. Walnut shrimp is to dye for, and the plate is balanced out with lettuce on the bottom. Vegetables taste fresh. None of the food is gunky greasy like many other Chinese food places.
Service is impecable. The man working makes it feel like a home vibe. Food is out in a timely manner.
Over all I would recommend highly recommend Fortune Bowl over any other Chinese food restaurant. The food here is better than Panda Express.< /Text>

<review>Fortune Bowl has consistently delivered it's fresh, crispy, hot, spicy, deliciousness  whether it be dining in or take out. When Chinese is on the menu at our place, I know who's doing the cooking. Next time you get a hankering for some good Chinese food, deny your taste buds no longer and let Fortune Bowl do the cooking for you... I'm pretty sure you'll have a new,...go to...<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dd355dd7651809:0x5a2a1b589b41bd2d< /GmapID></record>

cant believe this owner/cook.

I have been coming here for 2 years.
I come regularly couple times a month.
I ordered togo and when I got my steam rice was super crunchy. So when I came in for lunch I mention it to him my wife had to make rice and warm up our entrees. He stayed quite and gave me a dirty look. I was like whatever and left. I came to eat with a couple of co-worker. He saw me and this !@#$ added a bunch of salt to my entree. I wanted to go leave on the bill but I was with my coworkers.

LAST TIME I EAT HERE!

Mandarin Kitchen on Torrance Blvd is way better beef quality is way better. try it< /Review>

My friend and I eat here a lot and the food is always fresh and hot. It's only a one man cook, but he gets your orders done fast and right every time. I recommend Fortune Bowl 100%!< /Text>

I love this place for their lunch specials. Food is great and the owner/cook is a character. Don't expect a classy place and you won't be disappointed. Maricela's (my partner) favorite is the chicken chow mein. I love their Kung Pao Shrimp. Food is made on the spot. Not sitting on hot trays.<//Review>

I've been a loooong time customer but I must say,  the Jesse extra special has slipped a bit in my opinion. The meat was over cooked and didn't have much flavor.  Also 3 burritos and 2 cokes  for  $40 was a little expensive</Review>

Mom and I went twice already. We ordered green enchiladas. The next time, we ordered bean and cheese burritos. So far, this is the best Mexican restaurant we eaten at that is not too far from home. Mom wishes their burritos had white cheese, but I think cheddar is more for the typical American palette. It added flavor to the burrito. The burrito was bigggggg!  I definitely give the burrito a solid 9. The enchiladas' green sauce was tasty and the taste did not over power the tortilla  or chicken. Service is fast and efficent.< /text>

< Review>
For the quality of the food this place  it is overpriced.   I've been to many Mexican restaurants and I cannot believe their beers were $8.  We pay that much at fine dinning but didn't expect that here.  The chicken plate was dry.  I give 3 stars only because of the service but my next visit to LA I will not be coming back.< /Review>

<review>We love Arco Iris, even my 5 year old loves this place especially the service. Everyone is extrememly plesant and the food is great. My favorite is the chilaquiles verde(spicy). However them burritos are legend make it wet again with the green salsa, too good, I'm getting hungry.<//review><pics>None</pics><time>1448728104985</time>< userid>

Took a chance and ordered several pizzas for a party and everyone commented on how they were surprised they were from me n Eds as they didn’t taste like it (nice way of saying they were not good 😒) not returning after this, will take a lil longer drive to Kingsburg for better quality pizza.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

This place needs to get it together. They forgot our cheesy garlic sticks on one occasion. Then made cinnamon sticks on another when we ordered bread sticks. Then had to wait an extra 30 min for their mess up. Ridiculous. Its a dam pizza parlor. How hard can it be, geezzzz. I don't get it.<//Review>

Everytime I order pizza it ends with me getting a bad pizza or toppings I didn't order. This review is about tonight's attempt. Placed an order online for a calzone and a pizza to be picked up. Got there and the person helping me gets the pizza then asks if a calzone is in the oven. Then looks at me and goes and asks if it was made, I hear no, sorry. Person comes back tells me to grab a soda it'll be 15 to 20 minutes sorry. I refuse the soda ask for just the pizza and a refund on the calzone. The refund is getting worked on. Taking awhile and I notice a couple returning with a pizza in hand. I check mine and it's oval shaped, (week of Easter no less), ask the boxing person what happened here. I show him he replies with "What". Really? He tells manager dude who looks at it and says they couldn't fix this before cooking. Offered me a refund but what's the point? Point is: go elsewhere. Take a drive to kingsburg or try another spot in Selma. Save yourself the disappointment.</text>

<review>For a while I was upset with these guys. But then I learned  it was me cuasing most of the problems. I would start an order and the do a split which caused all the topping changes that I made reset. And I couldn't figure out how they kept getting my order.  Once I figured that out, then it just became a matter of missing ranch. But when they nail it, its money.</review><userid>104224222592108684315<//userid><rate>4</rate>< pics>

The app sucks now you can't pay on it therefore you can't order via the app. Call in and wait times are 10-15 minutes on the phone. When we do get our order our side of ranch is always opened and spilled inside the bag. This Me N Ed's needs some improvements.</Text></record>

Staff was nice it took a bit for my order to be ready . The pizza was tasty but the dough was not cooked it was soggy so it made the pizza not good to eat. I looked like uncooked dough and it was not good could not eat . They took care of the problem very well . Very happy and would recommend them<//Text>

I called in an order for pick up and when I went to pick it up the workers couldn't find it. I gave my name and number about 5 times to the cashier and he called the manager to help. The person who took my order put it under the wrong name and wrong phone number.</review>

This place is a joke.  Customer service is ridiculous, you call them and they put you on hold for a long time, then when you hang up and call back they want to put you on hold again. If you tell them you have been holding already and haven't ordered yet they hang up on you.  The managers need to hire more competent people to run such a restaurant.  Either that or get better management to handle the employees competency.  I will never try to use this Me-n-Eds again.<//review>

<text>Beer on tap for self pouring is an interesting idea, but it actually is not that great. But the pizza is good and place and people were really nice. I'm not going to take a star off for the beer situation. Some may like it by the ounce from tapping your bracelet, but I find that I feel ripped off by the head.< /text><Rate>5<//Rate><GmapID>0x8094f03d31cb4971:0x147aa887ac9669ef< /GmapID><Date>1580533228975<//Date><Name>Brett Stalbaum</Name>< pics>

Absolutely horrible party service! Was told I had 30 minutes to decorate before my party started which was fine. However, I called the day of to see if it was possible to come earlier and was told I couldn’t even be there till my party started giving me no time. I was decorating when my guest were showing up. I asked to have the TV’s turned on 3 times and they never came. When one of the workers came to bring pizzas I asked again and he goes “sure,” claps his hands and pretended to turn on the TVs as if it was a joke! Don’t even get me started on the delays of the pizza! Took them almost 40 minutes to bring out pizzas in between. There was only one worker that seemed nice enough to help me out. Everyone else was in their own world, rude, and slow. To top it off, the manager called me the next morning accusing me of not paying for half my tab! When in fact the worker didn’t even know how to use the register and charged it as a check instead of a card and the mistake was on their part! Never doing business there ever again and won’t recommend them.<//Review>

When we arrived for the party other people in our party room and Me and Ed’s said they had no record of our reservation. They didn’t have enough tables at first for our party in the general area, eventually we had room for everyone. Service was horrible took long time to make our food and didn’t receive all of our orders. Beer was warm.

I don't like pizza cause I can't eat the sauce, but they made it good I ask for no sauce and it was good not dried. We eat in Sanger and live in Sanger and ask for half no sauce and my side is always dried so I stop eating pizza but yesterday we ate pizza and I was happy with it. Thank you< /Text>

My mom and I ordered #2 the lunch special and we ate at the restaurant.
After we ate I was looking at the receipt and the employee accidently charged us to much.  I brought it to the  employee's attention and another employee who looked at my receipt and they got the manager Pablo.  They refunded me my money, because I had my receipt.  My mom paid cash and threw her receipt away after she placed her order.  We had not left the restaurant when I discovered we had been over charged.  The manager, Pablo refused to refund my mom's money because she threw away her receipt even tho the employee knew that he charged my mom the same way,  but that wasn't enough for Pablo the manager to refund my mom her money.   Probably today the employee over charged several  customers that ordered the #2 lunch special.  The employee thought if he didn't charge for the soda it would charge the right price, but it made us still pay more than what we should of.  The manager Pablo would not make it right right for my mom.  So my mom left with being over charged for her meal.  Not cool !!!!!!         The food was good and the employees were polite .  The manager gets no stars.</text>

<review>Called in a pizza to go due to time constraints. Pizza was ready just as they told me, in 15 minutes. The pizza was piping hot just out of the oven straight to the front seat of my car.
Fresh pizza was delicious, the crust was tasty, didn't leave any crumbs in this pizza. Thanks Me & Eds great job!<//review>< pictures>

<time>1551061381575<//time><Text>I have been eating at both the Kingsburg & Selma locations for well over 20 years, and have always said that Me N Ed's is the best and can't be beat.

Well, after the last two times I'm no longer saying that.

I ordered a pizza for delivery yesterday on the phone because the website hasn't worked in over a week and I can't get the online only coupon, so I had to pay more money for less toppings because of their website not working.
On top of that, the gal who took my order sounded like she had just taken a handful of horse tranquilizers.
Perhaps that's why I was brought a VERY  undercooked THIN CRUST pizza, when I ordered ORIGINAL CRUST.

A few weeks ago we ordered for delivery and got thin crust as well.
The thin crust SUCKS! I never order it, yet I've received it twice now.
I'm not the type to make the delivery driver stand there while I check my pizza, because I think it's rude to the driver. But if I do decide to give them a 3rd chance, I'm definitely making the driver wait while I double check the order.

Seriously, after the tip, I ended up spending $20 on ONE pizza that nobody wanted to eat because that thin crust tastes like greasy cardboard.

The whole reason I brag about Me N Ed's is the crust. And the last two pizzas I ordered had the worst crust ever. Especially that 2nd undercooked thin crust. So gross.

UPDATE
2/24/2019
I order a pizza for delivery at 3:41pm.
I call them at 5:25pm to inquire about my pie. They tell me it left "15 mins ago"(5:10pm).
5:45 rolls around and I call them back to around again. They then tell me that my address was wrong (same saved address I've used on their online order form for years now) and claim they called me but I have no missed calls from them, or voicemail for that matter.
The manager picks up and makes me explain everything all over again. Then he tells me that it's my fault(which it wasnt) that their ignorant driver can't figure out why voicemail exists. Calls don't always go through with mobile phones. That's why you leave a message! No wonder you work as a pizza delivery driver!

Me N Ed's USED to be the best. Now all they do is make my hungry family wait for hours and then leave us having to figure something else out at the last minute because of their lack of "give a damn" about their customers or their job performance.

Now let's talk about the so-called "manager" who was working on this date.
This guy spoke to me like I was worthless. There was NO sense of caring in his voice whatsoever. You could tell he just wanted to get off the phone and shut me up however he could. Instead of acknowledging the things I was saying, he just kept saying "Yeah, I dunno, sorry".
Well that's not how a GOOD manager does his job. A GOOD manager finds a SOLUTION to the problem that makes the customer happy AND want to return again. NOT an EXCUSE that will piss the customer off and feel like they're being talked down to.
Well, thanks to this specific manager, I will NOT be returning, and neither will anyone in my extended family. And that's a LOT OF CUSTOMERS YOU JUST LOST WITH YOUR APATHETIC, IMMATURE EXCUSES!

Kingsburg Me N Ed's is still the one to live up to. Selma's location can't even get close to the quality and customer service I get at the Kingsburg location. Kingsburg Me N Ed's gets 5 stars. Selma's Me N Ed's should be closed down by the Dept. Of Poor Excuses and Apathy.<//Text><gmapID>0x8094f03d31cb4971:0x147aa887ac9669ef<//gmapID>< response>

Good things are Great pizza. Good location in home Depot parking lot close to fwy. Lots of TV's and open floor plan and  Reserved party room.  Bad things are few arcade games. Beer taps usually running low or out, no budweiser. Some booths need to be cleaned before u can find a empty one. Music juke box needs to be updated and plays to low especially when employees don't want to hear what u paid for they will lower it down on you.< /Text>

The place was dirty...... we didn't even want to eat the pizza but already had paid for it. Too many people in the kitchen stepping over each other. Was out of many condiments. My pizza was just thrown together and did not look good to eat.<//Review>

Tonight’s experience at me n eds was amazing. My guests and I are in awe with the great service. The beer was delicious and cold and the environment was very inviting! The pizza was to die for. The woman in charge was so sweet when i asked for help with my beer tap she and the employees made my visit so nice!< /text>

Those employees are good workers!! That place is very busy by 5 on the weekends. The coolest thing after living out here by Fowler packing for 11 years is I just found out,  that they do deliver to Fowler packing, so when I called Selma "me n eds" They were willing to deliver to us!!  We haven't got to enjoy any delivery services for food for 10 years!! Thank you guys!! I do make a point to call the by 4 pm to my order especially on weekend. Sat. Called pizza order from freeway lanes @ 6pm was told it would be 30 mins. for me to pickup. I was only 10 mins  away. Went in to pay thinking I had at least 10-15 left to wait. No, believe or not, they were ready!! Thankyou to the employees!! Awesome job!<//Text>

Use to order delivery from here quite a bit but stopped. Over time delivery has gotten worse and worse. Bring me the wrong orders, partially right orders but wrong items. Sometimes super long wait. There was this one delivery driver that use to treat me so well and bring me a few extras if he messed up something. If I remember correctly his name was DJ? Maybe DK or something. Haven't seen him in quite awhile and wish they'd bring him back<//Review>

Called in a to go order from accross the street in view of the location ( there were literally 2 vehicles in the lot). Held for 10 minutes to place my order. I walked out with my personal pizza after an additional 25 minutes. Waaaaay too long. The location is filthy dirty as well. Disappointing.< /Text>

When working with the public and in customer services there is a way to speak to people, especially the clientele. I arrived at this location at 9:20 pm when the website states it closes at 10 pm. Upon arrival, we were was greeted but instead rejected service in a very rude manner by a team member named Sky. I understand it’s late and people want to go home near closing, however; tone and delivery are vital in customer service.

I do suggest the times be updated to save the customer drive time.</text>

Went in to pick up our pizza about 6:30 on Friday July 27th. The line was very long, about 10-12 people and only one register open. Right next to the line of customers was 3 garbage cans over flowing with garage onto the floor. Employees walking in and out of the prep area and just pushing the garbage out of their way.  DISGUSTING! Employee in back, maybe on break, drinking soda and visiting with and distracting working employees. Manager FINALLY asked someone in back to open the other register. NEVER seen it so bad. Disappointed!<//Review>

If I could leave no stars I would. Called in a Dine in order 20 mins ahead of time, waited at the restaurant for 45 mins and they brought out the pizza undercooked and super sloppy. They gave a free cookie which was undercooked as well and I got my money back and left. Worst me n Ed’s around. Nothing but lazy slobs work there. Horrible service.< /Review>

< Review>
Great food! Me N Eds is always delicious. For this location specifically in Selma, it does get packed at times which is understandable because the food is delicious. I would love to give 5 stars BUT I have had some issues. I usually order for delivery or pick up. When I pick up they never have parmesan cheese because they ran out. They sometimes give me wrong extras that i ordered like jalapenos on the side or ranch.  I ordered a large cheese bread which is the cost of a pizza didn't bother to look at it while I was there and once I arrived home it was burnt. It did not taste good. There was no way for me to go back to me n eds which would have been inconvenient. One time recently I placed an order for delivery and 3 hours later it was delivered. But they did give it to me for free. So they made up with that mistake. Their customer service is great! They are nice it's just they need to deliver better on the products.

Overall great food, great customer service.
They just need to look at the food and make sure it's the way it should be and get the orders right with the extras. I understand that sometimes there's a lot of customers but we are paying for something for the food and service. So please check before you give the customers their order.<//Review>

They put one pineapple topping on our large pizza we didn't request for.  Also, they couldn't cut the pizza slices they were too big and skinny ones, with small and wide ones. We didn't receive our garlic knots and was denied getting it with our order even though follow the instructions and downloaded the app. We found a black hair in our pizza. Hope I can get a refund for this.< /review>

<review>The on tap system is an unique approach to beer bar. The problem I have is price per ounce. The glass holds 14 ounces of beer and at $.50 to 0.06 per ounce, you end up paying $6 or more per beer. There is no options for reduced cost as when you purchased a pitcher on the past. Sorry I reccomend you dont by beer from here at this price.</review>< name>

Poor, poor customer service. The fist call I placed, the guy answered in Spanish, realized he made a mistake and then hung up. The second call, he answered and hung up without saying a word. The third call, a girl answered and when I asked about reservations, she had minimal clue. On their website it says reservations accepted but she told me I have to come in person to make them?? She consulted with her colleague in the background and she was just as disturbing. I explained my situation but nothing changed. Not going to drive an additional hour just for a reservation that can be done via phone.</Text>

To many ppl working . they got my order mixed up with another customer and the guy at the register was basically telling me i didnt have an order that i called twice about for pick up and their was a 2 hour wait on deliveries really? To many chiefs working not they were confused. If i didnt say nothing about the other persons order maybe being mine they probably wouldnt have figured it out. Plus they didnt even apologized and my pizza was garlic bread was cold when i got home.</review>

<Review>The employees are really polite, awesome attitudes. They give 110% effort in helping their customers. Their food is really good. One of the managers,  Miranda Gonzales, helped me with everything I need and reminded me to get ranch with my pizza because you can’t have their pizza with out ranch. It’s the law.< /Review>< Pictures>

good and bad..
the pizza is unique and one of the best.. for those that say the crust is dry they need to understand that it is crafted to be that way.. the pizza is great.. i have never had a bad combination.. need a little work on the side order items.. the taste is lacking on all side items (wings)..
the service is horrible.. they have some of the worst staff you can possibly imagine.. i have never, in the last 5 years, had a pleasant experience with the people that work there.. they are not kind and they all act like they don't want to be there or help anybody.. every other me'n'ds i have visited does not suffer from this problem..
the worst thing is the wait times.. i understand that they get busy but they always give the wait time of 15 to 20 minutes and its always 40 to 50 minutes for an order.. sometimes they ignore or forget orders all together and even worse, if your order is done, sometimes they leave it on the counter sitting for minutes until you go up and ask..
worst of all this, i have never ever heard any of them say sorry for their bad service to me or any other customers ever!!
its best just to get delivery and avoid the bad service all together, just be prepared to wait even longer..
good pizza though..</Text>

Food was good. Service was the worst ever. We ordered in 3 different families. We waited for an hour for our food while our other families were already done eating (and we ordered at the same time). Then they tried to give us someone else's pizza that wasn't event matching what we ordered.  We ordered garlic cheese bread and the cheese wasn't melted.  Then when we had to ask about our food for the 4th time the girl was very rude about it! We were celebrating my father's 64th bday. My brother in law and sister in law both were managers for me n eds for 15 years and they were shocked with the service. This is the worst Me n Ed's I've been to yet. I wont be going back.</Text>

<review>I would rate a 0 ZERO!!! Constantly get my order wrong and then they tell me, “maybe u should stick with the one in kingsburg” since they seem to follow the instructions on the tag. This is coming from an ex employee so they’ll treat anyone this way, be warned. I made an account just to leave a review</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Best Me n Eds pizza in the valley. Every time I get to eat here I really want to go back the next day. I srsly could eat here once a week for sure:) If you like me n eds pizza, stopping in selma on day is a good idea. Right off the freeway. They have a pretty good sized dining room and a bigger selection of video games/toy games if you have kiddos with you. pretty good sized tvs for a me n eds too. It's no sports bar----the pizza is the main event. Really been enjoying their Valley Veggie lately but my classic go to is Canadian Bacon, Imported Mushrooms, Olives and Pepperoni, try it! :)</Text>< GmapID>

Worst place to go and order pizza, I drove 20 miles to this place to pick up 3 pizzas, went back home and come to find a LONG BLACK HAIR on my Veggie pizza, keep in mind I am hungry and come to find a hair! I called the place to make a complaint to the manager and they transferred me 5 times on the phone and kept giving me the run around. Until I just hunged up the phone. Last time I go to this place, does not deserve my $ and plus the customer service SUCKS! Dont recomend.<//text>

There were only 2 customers in there and it took over 20 minutes to get sandwich. Wasn't impressed with employee courtesy, not rude just indifference to customers. I never write negative reviews, but I felt I had to in this case, great company that's off track.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp></record>

My mother usually doesn't complain about pizza but she also said that was the worst tasting pizza she's ever had!! If I could minus 5 stars I would!!</review>

< Review>
The pizza is great but I wish they would have two separate registers for dine in and take out. So for those people who stand in line and then when it's time to order don't know what they want, could take their time so those who called in their order can just pay and leave.< /Review>

<review>Selma Me & Eds has the poorest services ever. Lack of leadership and management.  They have a bunch of kids working there that just fool around. ALWAYS  I MEAN ALWAYS  late with delivery and dine in orders. Food is often received cold or wrong order. I believe corporate needs to clean house and find real management to get this place in order.< /review>< Time>

The food was perfect but the little arcade games didn't work all they did was take your change and not give it back. They could have at least put a sign or a warning up that they were outta order so people don't just give their change away to them.</Text>

Avoid on the weekends.

Staff lacks coordination and it shows by incredibly long wait times even for pick up. Cashiers are either swamped and have to abandon a line of customers to help cut and box pizzas, or waiting idly for the cooks to pick up the pace. Weekdays tend to be more evened out and wait times are pretty much cut in half.<//review>

personally id rather go the one in Kingsburg. the pizza is good, but sometimes the lines are long, the place is dirty, often jam packed with large Mexican families, someone else mentioned the awful loud music. the Kingsburg facility is clean quiet and pizza is the same.<//text>

We are so sorry about the current restroom situation as we are under construction for our remodel so yes, one of the restrooms is closed.  The other restroom is open and we are so sorry that our staff did not make that clear.  In regards to running out of Pepsi, we are sorry to hear that and are looking into this and what caused this issue.  We hope that you will give us another shot soon and also check out the Selma pizzeria once it has been converted to an On Tap location.\n\nIf you would like to discuss your experience further with us give us a call at 888-636-3373.'}< /resp>

Best pizza in town .you gotta be a picky person to believe otherwise
...so I just called in myself a personal pan for takeout,and I had felt really bad that I waited till my( hardworking best husband ever) went to bed ,before calling and sneak ing off to get it. And when I arrived,I began paying and the lil chick worker informed me that she tossed another personal in cause she didnt like how it looked and it would be a few more min. But because of the inconvenience of that situation. I could keep them both.SO LIKE I SAID BEFORE,AND ILL SAY AGAIN,  (bEsT pIzZa In ToWn!!!!!)5 no 20 star rating on my behalf🙌
And not just because I got two for the price of one.
It's cause its made to a higher standard/w quality sourced ingredients😀😉😋😎😵</Review>

We pride ourselves in operating a very clean store surrounded by great product and service. In fact, service is one of our core values in our mission statement which is to “build a consistently satisfied customer base founded on great family hospitality” and what you experienced was not that. We dropped the ball when it comes to wait time on both and we will be working with our Selma team to bring up their awareness. Thank you for taking the time to notify us and I hope you give us another try.'}<//response>

We pride ourselves on serving the best pizza in the Central Valley and we are sorry that is not the experience we provided for you.  It appears we dropped the ball and we will be working with our Selma team to bring up their awareness. Thank you for taking the time to notify us and I hope you give us another try.  If you should feel the need to contact me, please email me at mperry @ milano-ri.com."}< /response>
