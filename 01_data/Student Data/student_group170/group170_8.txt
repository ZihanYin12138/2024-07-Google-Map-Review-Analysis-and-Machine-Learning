I really liked the food here.  I had a Carrot Ginger soup, which was creamy.  I took a star away because it did not come with bread and cost $4 extra.  The bread was good though, served with an artichoke butter.  I also enjoyed the Beyond Burger with fries.  The side salads are very fresh and delicious too.  Also, try the Atalaya red wine from Spain is delicious.</review>

<review>SHOR offers limited menu, due to Covid restrictions affecting dinning in, but what my family and I ordered was fresh and tasty.  I had the Reuben sandwich, which was very good, fries were fresh.  Pepperoni pizza was also good, generous with cheese and pepperoni.  Service was great, Rob G. was attentive and friendly.<//review>< pics>

<Review>This restaurant is my favorite site.  Of all restaurants I know I like it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to that place. when  I want to go to a delicious lunch, this restaurant comes straight to my mind. extremely good and all sorts of  food and a rich cuisine.generous staff, and good atmosphere. Not less important, the pay is reasonable. I tell about this place with no doubt.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Located at the Hyatt Regency hotel. We ate lunch here on a Tuesday afternoon. My wife and I both ordered the Lobster Roll and loved it. The bun was toasted and the lobster meat was in large chunks with a little mayo mixed in and a slaw topping. It also had a generous helping of house made potato chips that I loved. The reason for only 3 stars was the slow service and we were never checked on for drink refills. We sat outside and service might be better inside.< /Review>

Wonderful short rib bolognese!!!  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the meat was so tender and the sauce was sooo good.  We shared one dish and left very full.

Looked nicer but I took a bite before taking the photo.  The marinated olives were really good too.< /Text>

I celebrated my daughter's entire bday weekend here. My teenager and her fam and friends couldn't stop talking about how great the staff was to them, not only at the restaurants but at the pool area too. They were so attentive to the teens, and nice! Kids always tell the truth when it comes to places like this. I will def recommend this place to big families, and I will return here forever. They have found a loyal guest here, and I will bring my family and friends. Btw, I booked 4 rooms for my daughter's 15th bday. Everyone was happy with the service, hospitality and family friendly restaurants and staff. The waiters at Shore were fantastic. They have no complaints from my entire posse of 20 total at the table. Rob de Oaxaca, Jose, Mauricio from
Shore Seafood and Grill were so attentive, kind, and their service was great!</Text>

Had breakfast here as a guest of the hotel. Service was prompt and friendly. Ordered the acai bowl without the yogurt. The amount of fruit and granola was generous which I liked. I also ordered a side of avocado, which was basically a few slices for $4. Overall I enjoyed but maybe a bit on the pricey side for the portions.<//Text>

Pork chop was very dry, calamari appetizer was too breaded and calamaris them self were too small. Stay away from this place if you do not want to get upset with your evening.<//review>

Truly excellent tuna followed by a good burger. Restaurant lacks atmosphere and the outside space is alongside the valet parking drop off which badly let's it down. The layout needs revisiting and the outside dining area needs extending out at the rear overlooking the garden instead of being beside where car engines are running<//review>

< review>
The Calamari was tasty and the drinks were on point. Some friends invited me over one after noon for drinks and we ended up staying here for hours until night time. The ambiance was very nice. I was expecting them to charge my debit card but for some reason, they charged to my room. The manager at the moment seemed to have a attitude when I tried to find out what was going on with how I was billed.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I had a wonderful experience at the SHOR restaurant tonight. The ambiance is very soothing, with Zen-like decor and lovely art pieces. Wonderful staff, very attentive and curteous, and well trained in food allergies management. The food was delicious and plentiful, good value for the money. Not sure why other reviewers were not happy, I surely was. I'd definitely recommend this place for dinner. Many thanks to everyone (our waiter, the manager, and the chef) for accommodating our food allergies, and for making sure we had a safe and pleasant experience.</text>< Pictures>

We ordered the clam chowder to take to our room. It was cold. We brought it back and got a barely warm one in return. I was hungry so I was going to eat it. However, the first bite I took was of uncooked, hard potatoes. Very disappointed. I went to bed with out dinner. We paid too much to just throw the food out, in my opinion.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>We had breakfast here. There were only two other costumers but the service was very slow. Coffee was cold and we had to send it back. Bacons were completely burnt. Overall the food was mediocre at best and overpriced.<//review>< name>

Nice change from our usual brunch fare. Don't miss trying out the restaurant even though you aren't staying at the resort.</Text>

< Review>
Signature restaurant at the Hyatt Regency Newport Beach.  The new exec chef Julien twists his French training into unpretentious california cuisine.  Definitely recommend the kale sprouts appetizer at lunch, addicting.  And there fresh baked sourdough with fennel butter isirresistible.  Desserts are very creative takes on classic!<//Review>

<name>Tracey Caldwell<//name><Text>Don't think I will be back. Play off to be a fancy restaurant and the high prices to go with it but no.
I sat outside on the patio because I was cold with a nice view of valet and the smell of diesel from a truck parked there for a while.
I got fish tacos for $17. Well I think they were fish tacos. More like cabbage tacos with a bit of fish. The cole slaw was cabbage with mayonnaise, cilantro and black pepper and didn't taste like cole slaw at all. The fish wasn't bad by itself but when you put the bland corn tortilla, that cole slaw pile and the little bit of fish together you get the worst fish tacos I've ever had. The chips and salsa was ok..had better salsa. The waiter didn't seem to understand or speak English very well so I wasn't always sure what was being said. He was kind but didn't come around much and I had to find him to pay because I didn't want to wait any longer.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dce079c71483ed:0xfbdf4bcb55948383< /gmap_id>< Date>

This laundromat is actually very nice! It was the first one that I ever went to when I moved to the area and I was pleasantly surprised! The system with using Clean King card takes away the hassle of getting quarters. It is a pretty clean place, and I definitely would reccomend!<//review>

<Review>Great place.  Always cleaning and restrooms are actually clean. The lady working on this day and during this particular time, which is morning, is very nice and has a great sense of humor. The only issue I have every time is with vending machines,  they are always getting stuck.<//Review>< pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I enjoy coming to this laundry. Its really pretty. It makes me feel comfortable. I always see someone cleaning and there bathrooms are clean. If you have a complaint they help you and fix the issue. The issue was of a homeless man going in the restroom and one washer not working. The only thing that sucks is that they don’t give you free wifi so I download videos and movies beforehand.

To the owner- I will definitely try asking the lady next time around. Thank you for your response and for fixing these issues so promptly. I do recommend to my family and friends this laundromat.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1597962562444, 'text': 'We actually do have free WiFi next time you are at the store just ask the attendant for the password. The homeless problem we believe has been addressed and you should not see much of that in the store any longer'}</response>< gmapID>

Super cool place to do your laundry! Be careful about the vending machines though some of them just eat your money... overall really cool and a fun place if you like watching Spanish news and shows! Haha< /Text>

<text>My brother-in-law and I took 10 King size blankets to the Clean King laundromat in order to use their largest washers and dryers. This place is very large; very clean; has A/C; has several TVs; has small round tables and 2-3 chairs at each to sit on while waiting for your laundry; there are bottled water and soda machines; snack machines; laundry detergent and other necessary supplies in vending machines; they advertise 150 washer/dryer machines; they have a machine to buy a $3.00 card in order to load time on it from cash, debit/credit cards, etc. I loaded $40.00 on mine and ended up using $30.00 for all 10 blankets. I used 5 large washers and 5 large dryers, and was there for 2 hours. The time went by fast and it was a very pleasant time spent there! It is the most favorite laundromat I've ever been to in my whole life, and I would highly recommend it to everyone. I didn't take any pictures, but if you Google "Clean King, Sylmar, California" and go to their website, they have posted many pictures and they represent a very accurate picture of their establishment!<//text><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><Text>This review is LOOOOONG overdue! A few weeks ago while doing laundry I got locked out of my car. I had to call AAA and get a lock smith to come out. Needless to say, my phone battery was dead and the laundrymat was about to close. It was getting late. I was scared, cold, stranded, and didn't know what to do. Thank God, the Superintendent Maria, was a Godsend!!! She lent me her phone to call AAA, waited till a rep got on the line, stayed with me till they came, and even went as far as sparing extra change to make sure my clothes were dry. Not only does she go above and beyond to make sure her cleaning duties as a superintendent are met...The place was spotless! First and foremost, Maria goes out of her way to make sure you feel safe. That kind of service particularly as a first time customer is nothing short of  priceless! I can't tell you how important it is (especially during this covid crisis) to have a place to go to that is safe and clean to do laundry, and, makes you feel like everything is going to be ok. Maria is not only a godsend when it comes to exceptional customer service, but she is one of the most important assets to this facility!! Go to Clean King Laundry in Sylmar! Ask for Maria!.. You will not be disappointed...If she is there, she will definitely take care of you and all your needs!</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Mary the person in charge of the afternoon has all the time very clean compared to other times that I have gone at different times I cannot say the same. Mary is kind and helps you with any problem you have with the washers or dryers. She has a lot of patience. with the children. She is always attentive to anything that is happening or any questions you have about the card and all the time keeping the place where we choose to go to wash super clean. About the Laundry I can say that I like to go because it is very spacious and has enough dryers and washing machines and the prices seem good comparing other laundries especially the space to dry and they have chairs to sit and tables to eat in what one expects the washing machines.

(Original)
Mary la persona encargada de la tarde tiene todo el tiempo muy  limpio a comparación de otras veces que he ido en diferentes horas no puedo decir lo  mismo.Mary  es amable y te ayuda con cualquier problema que tengas con las lavadoras o secadoras.Tiene mucha paciencia con los niños.Ella siempre está atenta a cualquier cosa que está pasando o cualquier pregunta que tengas sobre la tarjeta y  todo el tiempo  manteniendo súper limpio el lugar donde nosotros escogimos ir a lavar.Sobre la  Lavanderia puedo decir que me gusta ir porque es muy amplia y tiene bastantes secadoras y lavadoras y los precios me parecen bien comparando otras lavanderías sobre todo el espacio para secar y tienen sillas para sentarse y mesitas para comer en lo que uno espera las lavadoras.< /review>

Got a set of 4 Michelin pilot sports with the discount saved $150 great price . The whole transaction was smooth pay for the tires, set up an appointment depending on what's available they tell you to bring your car in, it takes about 2 hrs to swap the new set, there is a fee for the disposal of the old tires about $10 u can wait or they call you when ready. Once I came back I was just handed my key and recipe at the counter absolutely nothing was said to me about what service I received I was kinda confused but that is probably my only complaint other than that it went well.</review>

Bad service!  I got a nail in my tire and they would not fix it without an appointment.  A flat is an emergency!!  You should not need an appointment.  The nearest appointment was 3 days out!  I have been buying my tires from Costco for years but not anymore.  Firestone tires will match Costco prices and will take care of you right away!</Text>

< Review>
Even though I purchased tires on-line on October 28 and was notified that the tires were shipped, when I came for my 11:00 am appt., I was told that only 2 out of the 4 tires were at the warehouse.  I had to make another appointment for one week later to get my tires mounted.  Hopefully the other 2 tires will be there.

Sal who waited on me was very helpful and informative.  I am disappointed with the whole tire ordering process.</Review>

I would recommend going to Alhambra Costco to get your Tire fix.  The sales people are more knowledgeable.</Text>

25 miles policy is a scam. Contact other Costco Stores before you get ripped off. Sincerely, the King of America. Templar Knight, Knights Templar. King Ewing Medal/Medal Ewing. Tell that illuminati Jesus the King is his Master's Master no matter what.< /Review>

<Text>I go here all the time for my tires. Great price. Why low rating? Because there is little fine print that says you should get your tires aligned after tires or risk damage to your car!!! If I have to go to another place to address an alteration Costco does then I really lose the ease and convenience of this service. I now have to go elsewhere. This I believe is a serious flaw. They need to add this as an optional service regardless of time.<//Text>< Date>

< Review>
They are always way too crowded. I have a warranty there so I could get a flat fixed free, but usually have to stand in line for almost an hour and then have to wait for hours. Better time and money wise to go somewhere else unless you go early when they are just opening.<//Review>

Only reason I buy tires here is because of price.  Service is the worst. The amount of time standing in line, being charged upfront for additional items that may or may not be needed, then later having to stand in line at guest services to get your refund on the items you didn't need - in the end its probably not worth it had I just went to another tire store and didn't waste all that time and frustration.< /Review>

<Text>I love Costco and am a huge fan! This review is only specifically for the tire center at this location.

With quality customer service being standard around here, I expect way better service than what was provided from the tire center. I showed up 20 minutes before closing to have 1 tire replaced. And I get it, I've been there before where you aren't the happiest seeing last minute customers walk in causing you to work a few minutes later. But I had just gotten 3 tires replaced the night before at the Azusa location. But they're service was way better, as the associates were very helpful and assured me that I can show up at anytime before they close and they will service my tires. I felt very comfortable and left with my tires. The only issue is that one rim was bigger than the rest, so I had to buy the original rim before putting the 4th tire. They said since I've already spent 4 hours waiting this day, out of courtesy, I wouldn't have to wait as long when I return and put the 4th tire since they weren't able to put it the first time. They would just do it really fast.

After getting my rim, I decided to go to the Monterey Park location because it is closer to me. But I definitely did not get the same service. The associates were giving everyone attitudes and making remarks because we showed up 30 minutes before closing. But when I was next in line, I was turned away. Even after they took in everyone before me. And everyone before me was getting 4 tires, while I just needed 1 and waited hours already the night before. Anyways, I just feel that this was really shi**y and unacceptable. I love Costco, but this location's tire service department surprised me.

This review's main purpose is to give others a warning if you are going to service your tires at this location, so that you are not surprised like I was. Have a great day everyone!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The manager on weekends, Riy, needs to find a new position. He’s not meant for anything that deals with direct communication with customers. Always looks stressed and it shows to customers.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The very long wait, just to repair a tire, you need to make an appointment, as if we knew when we are going to have a flat tire, if it is an emergency I do not recommend this location.

Great customer service. Reasonable rental prices ($27 for a one day mid-size rental with unlimited mileage) and a quick and easy rental process. The actual office is only open from 8-4, but if you need to do an after hours drop off, you just dump it at the Holiday Inn on Van Ness. So easy!</Review>

Terrible customer service. Employees are rude and disrespectful. If you're here for Lyft, go to ANY other location. They're really attentive when they want to get you signed up for the program, but if you're returning a car, changing your car or anything else they don't care. 12 people waiting, and mostly empty employee stations. None of the locations maintain their cars well. My last 2 pickups for a rental had loud squealing brakes. I returned one to have them fix it, waited hours, picked it up and the brakes were still squealing.<//review>

AVOID. NEGATIVE FIVE STARS. OVERCHARGE and ZERO customer service. From start to finish unprofessional and disrespectful employees and assistant manager. They are treating customers as if they have to be so grateful to rent a car from them. Zero, really zero customer service! When you first get in, they don't even look at you and God forbid using their tongue to just say hello. They will overcharge you, please check your receipts and be forceful in order to get your money back. The people working here are crooks. I felt like the employees have no training whatsoever or maybe they are plain stupid and untrainable. Ultimately, I'm making the management responsible for hiring these clearly incompetent people who are working behind the counter. I didn't have the pleasure to meet the manager of this location but I had the unfortunate pleasure of meeting the assistant manager. She was even worse than the employees, I had no idea that was even possible, being even more unprofessional and unfriendly than the employees. Dear Mr. Manager, could you please spend some time training your employees and fire your incompetent assistant manager. Or at least teach them to say hello and maybe put a smile on their faces. Is that too much to ask? Sorry, I think I'm asking too much from you. And if you want to use a little of your valuable time to make sure your employees don't overcharge your customers, much appreciated! Maybe the overcharging is your doing, Mr. Manager? Well, in that case... I'm lost for words. Future customers (not yet victims) AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COST, save yourself the headache!< /Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>Charles get the job done as if it nothing. What could have turn nightmare for me, he flip it around and gave me another positive look of the day. Thanks Mr. Charles for been there. The lyft guys was going to fix me in another location, because Mr. Charles study me since have been coming to the la Cienega, he immediately tell them I don’t think he will like it, and I ask why the lyft guys explain it will be per miles payment of the car, so I said no Mr. Charles was right I will not like it. I was surprised how he know I may not like it and that was true I didn’t like the place they were going to send me, so I waited 3days for an appointment to be available so I can get my la Cienega location back and am glad about the car they gave me it worth the wait. Guys when you go this place ask of Charles, he Knows what need to be done and he keep you going like abc.

Olayiwola is my name. 3yrs driving for lyft 5 star driver, I am recommending Charles for a high position.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Despicable!! I rented a car. Came out to drive it after coming out of my job and a tire was flat (slow leak from a screw in the tread). Called roadside service to have the spare put on. Drove it directly to Hertz. They told me I was responsible to pay for the Repair of the tire AND this would be on file as an incident report (you’re only allowed 2 reports and after, they won’t rent to you anymore). I repaired the tire at Firestone. Brought the invoice to Hertz, continued with my rental after paying over $70 in roadside assist and tire repair costs + lost wages from time off work... they are not reimbursing me for Anything. JUST received a call from Hertz saying they are billing me for $309 for the replacement of the tire (that has been repaired on My Dime) that is working Perfectly after it’s repair. In complaint, they said they had pictures of the tread of the tires from when I picked up the vehicle, claiming the screw could Only have come from me driving the vehicle and it’s not at all possible the screw could have been picked up on their lot. They Do Not have these pictures. I personally walked around the car taking a picture of every single photo the location rep was taking photos of. Also, he sent me all of his pictures as well via email. There are no Tire Tread pictures. They are attempting to lie their way into extorting $$ from me to further replace a tire that I have, at their request, already paid for the repair of! HERTZ is the WORST.</review>

Terrible customer service, terrible employees. They forced me to rent old Chevy Impala. I had order for 2015 and newer and higher class car. Also I paid deposit one week ago. I wasted my time and I didn’t get car.< /review>

It was a nightmare. Short staffed and took forever. HOWEVER, i must give a compliment to the rep named Pierre. People were bitching and moaning over things that were completely out of his control. He handled himself better than anyone’s expectations. GREAT JOB BUDDY!!!</Review>

This Hertz location only rents to Lyft drivers. They have worked out a few kinks in their process, so it is fairly streamlined and quicker than it was. There is a very helpful and friendly Lyft rep on site 10a-4p.<//Text>

<text>Absolutely horrible. Lazy workers and chexk this out Lyft Drivers if your $250 a week rental has a mechanical breakdown and doesnt even work and needs to be towed- you have to wait for their third party to scan the car and that can take anywhere from a week to a month and a half. Ridiculous. They are making amazing money off of us Lyft drivers then treat us like poop when something goes wrong on their end. They will not answer emails or even the phone. I highly reccommend finding another rental company<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2b9716f471357:0x717cff7568df873e</gmap_id></record>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>I rented a car for 2 months without any issues. I went to renew and the lil  skinny girl automatically assumed my license was expired because the date was worn out but in fact my license was still valid. Left me to walk home. I had no other transportation. I didn't get home till the following day. They have no consideration or compassion karma will eventually get that skinny girl for leaving me out in the streets with no way to get home. Just to reiterate I was legal to drive but that was there reason for not issuing me a car. I also had been a loyal paying customer for 2 months straight and they still did me wrong.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>I’m a Lyft driver. I rent car from Hertz la Cienega location. 3 weeks ago I went there to pick the car, my apt is 4:00pm, I got there at 3:00 just to make sure I can get a nice car to work with. But when the stuff show me the car it was a 2013 Passat. The car supposed to be no older than 2015 that’s what they said from the app. But when I questioned about this, the gentleman said that’s the only one they have. But I was standing there looking other ppl take all the other cars away instead of this 2013 Passat. I said my apt was 4:00pm and I got here 3:00pm. How come u told me there’s no other cars. What if I got here at4:00 and someone took this car. They said they would reschedule me. I worked full time job and been very busy I’m sure I’m not the only one who works hard. How we can go there every day to see if they have car available for ppl? We pay $240 for a week rental. That’s a big amount, they should well prepared for ppl who pays for them. That’s the basic service.
Today I went there for oil change. I was sitting there for an hour waiting for service. At the end they give me a little piece of paper to go somewhere else to get my oil change done. The stuff working for Lyft just sitting there playing the phone. The stuff works for hertz run very slow for everything. If any of them could be more effective I would get the oil change done by the time! But they keep me waiting for an hour there and when I arrived at the oil change place they were all on lunch break! I have to wait another 1.5 hrs! I have to work in an hour! How perfect they ruined everything!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>This place is horrible. Well under staffed. You would think that since they see demand is getting bigger they would hire more people. Good luck getting anything done over the phone. You'd be lucky if they answer but even then, if and when they do answer you'll just be placed on hold until your call gets automatically sent to a message center. And if you call back they'll just answer and hang up or just not answer at all. I've made over 30 phone calls all to no avail. As if they don't want your business. Oh and they try to give you a number to call for help since they are so busy...it's just Hertz phone reservations line and they'll just send you back to call this location. I have yet to hear back from a manager. That Daudi and Lauren worse employees. Glad Uber doesn't use this location anymore.< /Text></record></dataset><record>
< text>
They have bad customer service. They're rude. They open late and stop working before 5:00, which is earlier closing than other Hertz. They run out of cars often and are overpriced. They rarely, if ever, answer their phones.</text>

I had attempted to be a LYFT driver and this is the location to get a rental car for their rental car program. For me personally it did not work out because in Riverside County it is hard to meet the 85 ride quota to get the free rental. I was well treated and they understood my problem.</Text>

Got sent to this hertz because someone hit me and my car was being fixed. They gave me a compact when the insurance company was paying for a mid size. Claimed they didnt have any cars. If you dont have any cars send your customers to a hertz that does. It is an inconvenience to me having a small car that does not match the size of my vehicle.< /review>

<Review>Worse service I ever received from any car renal company anywhere in the world. Car was dirty inside out. Break wasn't working properly, they make me go there twice to change and that rude manger Carlos Castro didn't change supposedly they didn't have a car. They never answer phone and hertz corporate office couldn't be any more careless. Above all they miss up my information with two other people who had the car that I had before and I kept getting harnessing calls from the control department that car is critically over due and turned out that Castro guy didn't update the renter information. Biggggggg messsss.< /Review>< Pictures>

< review>
extremely bad costumer service.  do not recomend it, i rented thru lyft and the african american guy did not said a simgle word to me nor explained anything about anything. he just threw the keys on counter was at computer witha smile like on face. he walked out, and looked at keys lime saying bring it. as he was checking the car outside, he didnt check it thtough and i did find some scratches which is ok. i dont mind inside the car was super dirty not even bother to clean at all. so overall it has been super bad experience, im here now about to return the rental and hoping they dont come out with anything else tht might affect me.
Lyft of course super horrible since i got the car with them i thougnt tht i had to report a tbone when someone run red light hitting me, they deactivated my accou teven thou it was not my fault at all i just happened to be passin by at tht time, and i wasnt even online, and still got deactivated.</review>

The African American guy lies. He's probably the worse employee in this office. He should stay AWAY from the phone but for some reason he always answers. You have to call several times he always outs you on hold. Laziest person I've ever spoken to over the phone. Cars are always* disgustingly dirty. It is a shame that lyft has to work with them. The worse hertz location ever.<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>A total anarchy. The manager's name is Dayton and he is by far the less responsible and most careless store manager that I even dealt with. You book a car online get a confirmation # go there, they make you write your name in a list (really?)  After they make you wait an hour they don't even have a car and all they say, "book online doesn't mean a thing"  Then why waste people time and shut down your website you idiots!

A 3rd world caliber "customer service", a shame, and a total embarrassment for Herrtz. They treat people like second class citizen and their corporate office don't even care, i even get a survey to fill and nobody call me to say "sorry" I contacted their district manger whose less responsible that store manager. Total Anarchy!

Do not go to that office if they pay you and give you car for free.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<review>We have come here for 2 movies now and plan on coming back again before it ends in a few months. We love that is it distanced and makes us feel safe during the pandemic.

This place has the largest and clearest outdoor screen I’ve ever seen! Was told it’s a recently installed LED so matinees can be screened earlier in the day.

Fresh popcorn was great along with full bar, reclining individual lounge seat or combined  love seats (bean bags available as well), super cute/romantic hanging lights, ADORABLE photo backdrops, and incredibly welcoming staff. Really appreciated the cleanliness of the place. Saw staff routinely check, sanitize, sweep, etc. Everything was so organized!

Had such an amazing post-dinner date night experience. Just remember to bring a really warm blanket… or “forget” and cuddle up with your partner :)< /text>

Rooftop Cinema Club is rad! When I was told it was a screen on top of a parking garage I had my doubts but this was beyond any expectation. Great viewing experience, incredibly nice staff and a truly relaxing vibe. The backdrop of the city around was just another great unexpected treat.< /review>

It is a great date night and fun to see families taking advantage of it. Done it before at a previous location and this one is just as good, if not better.< /Review>

Great place! Fun vibe, comfy chairs. And they have great movies to choose from. Less pricey than some other rooftop/outdoor movies in the area.< /Text>

Great date spot! Sunset, beautiful view of the city and a great movie with good (and booze for those 21+).

Definitely will be making a return here. Word of advice - book early and arrive early. Parking goes by quickly and the liquor/food line gets lengthy.

This is also a great place to take photos so come picture ready! Whether it a with family or friends (or your bootential) this place is definitely a good time.<//review>

Unfortunately the overall experience wasn't very good. I think It would have been better if we came later.

Cons:

The matinee was at 5:00 p.m. and the assumption would be that we would be able to see what was displayed on the screen. When we watched Aladdin, there are a lot of indoor dark scenes. Whenever any of those scenes happened on the screen, you could not see anything because of the sun glare reflecting off of the screen. You could see everything very easily during the scenes that were not dark.

The chairs that we purchased were fine for my wife and myself but did not work for our children at all. We had to bring booster seats just so that they could see the screen. Had I known that the children could not see the screen from the seats, I would have purchased bean bags instead. Also, the bean bag section was separated from the regular chair section. I'm not sure how parents are supposed to sit with their children during the movie if they don't want to sit on the floor. The website should show what a typical seating arrangement looks like so that parents can be better informed.

The snack selection was a bit limited. Every time I went to go get popcorn they said that it would be ready 5 minutes later. Every 5 minutes when I went back, the popcorn was all gone. I had to come back four times and then wait the last time until I received my popcorn order.

Pros:
The headphones worked great. Parking thing was very easy. The staff was friendly.< /Review>

So, so glad to have discovered this outdoor cinematic gem! Stepbrothers and this place for the win The venue itself is awesome,  super comfortable seating (we went with the love seat which came with yummy popcorn). The staff is exceptionally friendly and the  queue is really well organized too. Recommend getting there 30 minutes early. The restrooms are portapotties but clean and large. Overall great experience.</text>

Great space for an outdoor movie and the seats are incredibly comfortable! I do wish they had their only food offering listed on the website or mentioned in their confirmation email along with the other details. It doesn’t have many options and would be nice if they allowed outdoor food because of that. Otherwise, definitely a fun experience!<//text>

<review>Came to celebrate a friend’s birthday. Staff was super friendly and helpful. The whole venue was clean and a really fun setting, great views and easy parking. The bathrooms (port a potties) were surprisingly clean and well-kept. Overall we had a good experience and would recommend to friends for a unique night out!<//review>< response>

<Text>Wonderful experience that is different from most date night activities. Everything was sanitized and distanced as well. Staff was welcoming during check in and the entire theater was set up in an aesthetically pleasing manner.

It’s a beautiful rooftop venue with comfortable beach chair type seating, socially distanced. You can choose to snuggle with your sweetheart in their love seats or go with friends and sit in their single seats, but all are paired 2 at a time. If you want to sit 3 in a row, you have to sit at one of the sides. There is a concession stand with snacks and drinks and a food truck that we didn’t partake of. I definitely would like to come back.< /review>

What a cute spot to watch a movie. They have a cute turf area where they put lawn chairs on top of a parking garage where they play classics. A perfect way to end the work week and relax. They have a bar area as well as food you can order while watching the movie. I’d definitely check it out.< /Review>

Came for the anniversary with the lady. Played some bags (corn hole) with a beer before the movie started, sat at our comfortable bean bags after an easy check in. Would do again. Btw, BYOF (bring your own food).< /Review>

Staff right as you walk in is very welcoming. Everything feom check in to seats to tickets to the movie is easy as could be. They have a full bar and games before the movie which makes it even more enjoyable. Would definitely recommend coming to this for a great experience as friends or as a couple.<//review>

<text>This place is adorable! They play trivia before the film which is beyond fun. My friend dragged me along with her and I’m happy she did! It took us a second to find where the movie was but once we did we loved it!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>This is a wonderful fun experience. Came here twice this month with my kids and so far and have had a great time both times. It does get chilly so bring a blanket is a must. There is food and a bar on location. The parking is easy and there is plenty of it. So glad I found this place and already planning our next visit.<//Review>< Rating>

<Review>The rooftop cinema was well set up. I went to the later showing, which was not overcrowded for the particular showing. The view of the movie was fantastic. The staff was efficient and courteous. You do wear headsets to listen to the movie. The restrooms are porta potties. They had sinks and soap, I would have appreciated a way to dry my hands (pro tip)..and make sure to dress warmly for evening viewings. I was dressed for winter and brought blankets. I was extremely comfortable, but many people who underdressed for the night weather and didn't bring blankets looked cold. Dress warm, bring blankets. They have alcohol and sodas for sale. Bring your own coffee. I enjoyed the experience and would definitely return.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

My girlfriend and I are from Arizona and have always wanted to attend a rooftop cinema and this was a good experience. It’s definitely cold but still enjoyable just make sure you have warm clothes and cozy blankets! Very nice friendly staff too so that’s always a plus :)< /text>

I'm so glad Rooftop Cinema Club is back! The first and only other time I went was in San Diego. I originally booked tickets for San Diego again, but found that I was going to be showing my friend around LA the same week. Rooftop Cinema Club was nice enough to let us change our dates and location to El Segundo for a date! I thought that was wonderful customer service.

They seem to be handling social distancing fairly well. My only complaint is they don't offer blankets like the San Diego location did in 2019, but that might be due to health and safety reasons (yknow COVID and everything). While there's isn't as much of a skyline to admire, the location in El Segundo is pretty nice to watch the planes go by ^^

I always recommend my friends to go to Rooftop Cinema Club showings and I'm so glad there are more locations!</text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>Awesome place, great views and comfy seats, really enjoyed hearing the film through the headphones. I think my only complaint is the “Hibachi” food currently being offered at the El Segundo location. To put it lightly- it’s really terrible. The chicken is bland, looks like they took the purdue pre cooked chicken and tossed it in soy sauce, the noodles were okay, and the vegetables were nothing to write home about (the veggie variety also didn't mesh with Hibachi). If you guys have a noodle cart, then say that. But don’t go claiming that this is Hibachi because that is NOT Hibachi, wouldn’t even call it food. You’re better off bringing food from somewhere else in the meantime and I hope they have a much larger variety of food options as the months go by.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Been going here several years while at time share at June Lake. Food is ingredient driven, a nice mix of modern and rustic, and not tiny portions. Every visit has been new and delicious. Service is excellent. The dining room is comfy and rustic, with large fireplace burning real wood. The real draw is the full width picture window overlooking Mono lake, always a spectacular sunset during dinner. Sometimes a great moon rise.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNUd2jd8y6xD0nNfV5ms8OQy2HitBwkw4ZrXF_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfqiIhpRO8RNfQwMc_7BNdEeuwImm_tlWfEhZY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgVpRwS-YdDqAKpfocwzv7pENlZBJBlU6fxqEy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL-C42BgpQC6e33sXY54syCH3roDtAANBL2_0z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

<Text>One of the primier dining spots in Eastern Sierra. Unmatched views of Mono Lake, and if you like bird watching while you have supper, this is your spot.

The two sisters that run this place clearly have done this as a labor of love. Hate to sound gushie, but this really is a 5-star restaurant.

And yes, the food is delicious</Text>< Pics>

Lana and Debbie are two sisters that run the inn. They work very hard to deliver a great experience. The place is small and casual with panoramic views of Mono Lake and the mountains. The Inn is well cared for and tastefully decorated with locally influenced art and furnishings. The food is amazing. The braised bison short ribs and gnocchi was ridiculously good. They were good to my kids too and made them a plain pasta dish. The wine was outstanding and the desserts were amazing. All super fresh ingredients and great cooking. I would definitely go again.< /review>

My significant other and I had dinner there in late June. The weather was perfect for dining out and watching the sunset over Mono Lake.  Staff was extremely attentive and amenable when the temperatures cooled off and we wanted to finish dining inside.  Food is fabulous and the wait staff are professional and courteous.  Wonderful place to end the evening watching the sunset over the mountains.  Go there and enjoy the view and cuisine.</text>

He prepared a delicious vegetarian meal for me even though it wasn't on the menu! My dinner mate said his pork chop was one of the best ever. The chef makes his own rubs and reductions and the results are excellent. Everyone raves about the restaurant at the gas station on 120 at 395 but the historic Mono Inn deserves  the same accolades, and the setting is 100 times nicer.

The restaurant itself is right above Mono Lake and the views from the dining room are spectacular. I love the interior design too. The building is owned by the descendants of famed photographer Ansel Adams. A stone fireplace anchors one wall, and huge windows provide the view. Classic Stickley furnishings in oak complete the romantic setting. Beer and wine bar, outdoor seating in season.

Highly recommended!</Text>< response>

We went to this place on my birthday to have a nice dinner. Unfortunately, the staff must have been having a really bad day. Right when we walked in I could tell they didn't want us there. The hostess yells from across the restaurant that it will be a while. I said no problem. We waited 5 minutes. Then she asked if we had a reservation. I said no. So she tells me again it is going to be a while. The small restaurant is less than 1/2 full. After waiting patiently for 20 minutes to be seated, the staff told us we could leave if we wanted. So we did. It seems they didn't want to be in business.< /Review>

Literally the only restaurant I've ever walked out of. I have been eating here for 30+ years.  The last time I was there I've never been treated more rudely in my life.  I'd rather eat at the mono cone every day I was in the mountains then ever step foot in this snobfest of a restaurant   as you can see by the lack of owner response that they could give a flying fart about the service they give our lack  of it</review>

We've now eaten here several times, after hiking nearby.  Have always been accommodated, even without reservations.  Since they have a small staff, promptness of seating & service is variable, but we've found it very friendly & capable.  The food is both unusual (game, for instance) and excellent.  The setting is gorgeous, especially if it's warm enough to sit outside and watch the changing light over Mono Lake and the antics of all the hummingbirds.<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Every region a higher-end restaurant and for the Mono Basin, this is it.  In Lee Vining you have the choice between a coffee shop, a restaurant next door, a deli/grill, and the Mono Inn.  Each serves its role well and at the higher end, you can't beat eh Mono Inn for the food or the view.

As other reviewers have noted, arrive before sunset for a treat, as Mono Lake has consistently excellent sunsets.  That's particularly true on the evenings before, during or after a full moon night, as the moon rises close to the same time that sunset is underway.  There is outdoor patio seating you can really enjoy the view from on a mild summer evening.

In spite of the enthusiasm expressed for the restaurant, it's useful to note that there's a very nice bar as well, and the restaurant has an excellent wine list, the most extensive and well-selected in the area.  I tend to pick the wine I want to have first, then select a meal to match, and on my last visit I was pleasantly surprised to see a hard-to-find Sean Thackery Rhone-style blend on the wine list.  The price seemed reasonable compared to what you might pay for it in the Bay Area or Los Angeles area.  Being a bit of a wine fan, that will bring me back to a restaurant faster than also-excellent food.

The restaurant is only open during the spring through fall seasons when most people visit the area, so call ahead if you might be visiting outside of their open dates.  This place can be popular, so particularly on weekends you might want to arrive a little on the early side to avoid waiting to get seated.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Great dinner and deserts and Lonna and Debbie are wonderful hosts. The building itself has a unique history and also has a local art gallery. Definitely a place to have dinner</Review>

If on a busy holiday weekend at 7:30, when every place in town is packed, you see a place with 60% tables empty, you can guess they are doing something wrong. Tried to eat there on a birthday.

Food is excellent, the chef creates an imaginative, seasonal menu. Everything is fresh, flavorful, and artfully presented. A meal here is several levels above what you typically find in the Eastern Sierra.  And then there's the view: the sunset view of Mono Lake, volcanoes, and the White Mts, 70 miles distant are sublime. Food and views are both deserving of 5 stars.<//Text>

We made dinner reservations, telling them about our anniversary and
anticipated pleasant experience.  That was not to be.  When we arrived
we were chastised for being 10 minutes early for our reservation and
they were not going to accommodate our table request.  We understood
and volunteered to wait outside.   When we were seated the service was
inattentive.  Jim took our ordered, delivered it and removed our
dishes. That was the last time we saw him. The food was OK, but not
memorable.  After about 15 or 20 minutes we realized the meal service
was over and no one was coming back. We flagged down the waitress.
asked for the  bill and paid.  No one offered us a dessert menu or
said good night.
The only thing that save the night was the amazing view.< /Text>

<Review>Shared dinner there with a friend last week....only the second time i've been there, as they over 2 1/2 hrs. away.  Even so, AWESOME!! Wonderful, friendly service and the food is to die for.  Get over there and try the WATERMELON PANZANELLA before the season is over.  Also had the pork tenderloin with red onion gravy and veggies--they do wonderful things with veggies, and usually, this is the part of the meal i skip. Lovely view of the lake, great food and helpful, friendly service--dont change a thing!! (but ok with me if you add more menu items!!)  :)<//Review>< username>

The food and price in this restaurant were excellent! I've never been let down by something this restaurant has to offer. It's a lovely atmosphere and a quiet spot to watch the sunset. It comes highly recommended!< /review>

It was also spicy which I enjoyed. The bavette (steak) medium rare was lovely and i recommend that as well. My party split the strawberry shortcake and although i didn't have any, they loved it.

Had a six course meal, with pairings from the main chef. The owner himself came and explained some things. Some dishes served family style. All items were exquisite from start to finish, including all food and wine and their pairings. Spotless clean, elegant yet simple and "homey" environment. Would come again and again and again.<//review>

One of the best burgers I've had. Bun tastes like crispy dough and the patty like a steak. Order it off the menu.<//review>

The food was great but the noise level was unbearable. My friends and I could barely hear ourselves speak. I realize the restaurant has a high ceiling and perhaps it can't be helped. I recommend it, but with reservation if you're sensitive to loud noises.< /text>

Made a reservation for three for my parents and I here on a weekend right after they opened up for dinner. The place was quite empty as they'd just opened, but slowly (not obnoxiously) filled up with [mostly older?] people. The interior of the space is gorgeous. Classic Southern decor with a modern exposed kitchen in the back.

The service was really fantastic. Definitely top 10 service experiences. And it felt really genuine too; didn't get the fake personality vibe from anyone.

The food was all perfect. We shared all our plates. The mussels were amazing. The cheese plate was wonderful. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it.

Also note: they have a killer wine selection.</Text>

Truly crafted "heirloom" cuisine. A restaurant that invites easy conversation and leisurely eating while serving up masterfully prepared dishes. Scallops, duck confit, apple cabbage salad — all delicious, incredibly fresh, and superbly prepared.</text>

On the other hand, neither the service, including hostess or server, or food was mind-blowing, and it was a bit pricey for the experience. The gnocchi was good, and the chicken was good, but not the worth the price. The duck and salmon were so-so. The appetizers were good, but again, just didn't feel like the value was there, with so many other options in the city.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Just came home from having one of the best meals I have had in a long time. For many years, a girlfriend and I have gone out a couple times a month to fine restaurants in the Bay Area. We both agreed that we can't wait to come back to Heirloom. The food was so good and staff was so friendly and helpful.  What a great a experience we had tonight.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>What a treat - honestly this might be my new hangout spot. I didn't have a reservation but the hostess promised to squeeze me in at the bar. The place was quiet and half empty at first but sure enough 15mins went by and it was PACKED. I mean people were being turned down left and right. We finally got sat at the bar and waited about 20mins for service, but the server promptly noticed we hadn't been greeted and offered us complementary glasses of wine. We didn't put up that big of a fight, and the rest of the night was amazing.

The food is brilliantly paired with balancing tastes and flowing wine. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the gnocchi was probably one of the best I've ever tasted. The portions are small but take it slow and you'll be full by the end of the night. We split everything for two and ordered 5 dishes - PERFECTION in every bite.

The chef personally came over to deliver each dish and told us to wait for the ceviche to finish marinating. I'm so glad we did because once again it was well worth any wait.

I will be back to try and taste more and hope that each time I can feel right at home in this cozy little Cafe.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Heirloom Cafe is a locavore's heaven! Locally grown, seasonal, fresh and thoughtfully prepared dishes yield some of the most tasteful bites in all of San Francisco. The pairing menu shines brightly, but you won't be let down if you choose to go the a la cart route. Delightful in every way and easily worthy of 5 STARS!</Review><Name>Stirling Spencer</Name><time>1468939906393<//time>< Gmap_id>

<text>Fun, buzzy, casual place. We joined in the atmosphere by ordering deserts first, then mains, then starters and no-one was the least bit fazed. First rate wine list with some amazing heirloom (sic) vintages, we drank Henzel 1975 pinot noir and an impressive Dunn cab sav from 1985. Yes, there was food too and I think it was good, but my recollection is rather impaired by the impact of the wine. LOL. Thought the staff were interesting and interested, they added wit and wisdom to the experience. Thank God for uber, Heirloom is a bit off the beaten track but I'd walk it, indeed I'd crawl back if I had to, it was really that good.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Resp>None<//Resp><review>This place is truly awesome. The food, vibe, decor. It has it all. It really shows that the owner is a sommelier in the wine list. The food is beautifully done, clean and elegant. It could be one of the city's best kept secrets. You certainly wouldn't know looking at it from the outside. It rocks.< /review></record>

<user>116178144915597382848</user><text>Too LOUD!  Advise the owner to add even more sound insulation padding throughout the rest of the ceiling and side walls (some pads on, but not covering all of the ceiling).  Hard to talk to anyone, left with a huge headache.  This is the loudest restaurant I recall ever eating in (noise level beyond many crowded bars).  Sad, as without this major issue, HC would be a great place to return to as the food and service were good.  Please address the noise problem.< /text>< Time>

The food is really amazing, seasonal and healthy. The downside is that the location feels a little distant. It feels like a place that belongs in Noe Valley more so than the Mission. While the food is great, it's a little on the pricey side.< /Text>

Heirloom is perfect for an intimate dinner with friends or a date. The restaurant is spacious and comfortable, but the lighting is mostly candlelit and dim. The salmon was perfectly textured and was probably the best  I've had in SF. The side of broccoli was nothing like I've had before, you have to try it. Service was A+. PS. Thanks Flo for assisting with this first Plus review. Raph should be proud.</review>

Heirloom Cafe is a bit off the "beaten track" in the Mission, but it is a fantastic choice for a group dinner or a more casual dinner for 2. The servers provide great food & wine suggestions and the menu is regularly updated based on what's in season. I've had some of my favorite meals at Heirloom.<//text>

Food is pretty tasty and service is solid, but portions are small for the price and the place is loud even when it's not full. Universal and Bon Nene are good options nearby if you can't get a table, which is likely for walk-ins.</Text>

The restaurant has inventive and yummy food, plus very knowledgeable staff to give you food/wine recommendations if you're clueless!

On top of it all, there's no crazy wait yet because it opened <1 year ago - so go there while it's still "underground"!

Only negative to their rotating menu is that my favorite dish - the gnocchi - was not on the menu when  went back for dinner a few weeks later =(< /Review>

The goods - very friendly staff and warm cozy lovely atmosphere.
The bad - tiny servings for a hefty price, and over-reliance on heavily salting the dishes, rather than the delicate flavors of food.
My boyfriend had the mushroom fettuccini which was composed of a small palm size serving of pasta and ONE mushroom sliced thinly.
I had the seafood cioppino - very very salty to the point of not being able to eat the broth!!! There was a dozen small mussels and 1 oz (possibly 1.5) of cod in the seafood mixture.  No shrimp nor scallops.
Fettuccini $27, Cioppino $30.
Suffice to say, we left the restaurant feeling hungry ;(.<//Review>< pictures>

One of the best meals I've had in SF.

We started with two cheeses: both soft, creamy and surprisingly mild. Other appetizers were the burrata and scallops. For mains we split the gnocchi, hallibut, and burger (cooked with cheeses in the meats). All were equally stellar.

We had the recommended red wine: a metallic Pinot Grigio. Sharp on the tongue with a light finish. Perfect complement to the rich food.

Service was fine.

Ambiance was louder than expected but we were a group of three and they seated us at the end of a communal table and it worked perfectly. Conversation was intimate and we could drown out the rest of the noise.

Update after second meal here: just as god as before, but I was note conscious of how small the portions were this time.</Review>

<user_name>Nalani Ngoon Warde< /user_name><Text>Short version: it's good, it's expensive.  It might not be entirely fair to call it out as expensive, since what really made it more expensive than other similar places is that we got a lot more wine than we usually do.  But the restaurant is especially known for its wine, and they offer excellent pairings, so if you're not going to get the wine, why go?

Great food, great friendly, attentive, but unobtrusive service, nice semi-fancy, semi-rustic atmosphere.  And the wine was great.  It's always eye-opening for me to have wine well paired with food. I ordered a 2005 Rioja when we sat down, and we thought it was OK.  Later in the meal, the same wine came paired with my husband's entree (braised pork, polenta, maple-glazed delicata squash, orange-pecan gremolata) and it was 10 times better.  And with dessert we had a 2011 Jurançon Uroulat that was fantastic.

If we were in the mood to have someone hand-hold us through some excellent wines that can't be easily had other places.  But otherwise, for the money, we'd go to Blue Plate or Serpentine.</Text>< Response>

For an appetizer I recommend the roasted artichokes and for the entree, the sautéed local rock cod, cauliflower puree, English peas, ramps. It goes perfectly accompanied with the 2008 Pinot Noir 'Copain. This restaurant deserves 5 stars.</text>

My son is in Kindergarten and already is on 1st grade level in some areas so to better prepare him for 1st grade I searched for a Tutoring Program that was affordable to me! My sister told me about Bounce Back and I love them. They are very responsive with all questions and very patient, my son also has Adhd so this was important to me. They will help with IEP goals as well as academic goals. Did I mention they're affordable?! Thank you guys for your help and professionalism!!<//Review>

<review>My child had gaps in her instruction and had developed an extreme case of math anxiety. She is an extremely bright girl who grasps concepts quickly but was struggling due to lack of having had a logical progression of skills taught due to upheaval in the education process.

I found Bounce Back Tutoring to be well priced, very sensitive to my child's needs, good at assessing what skills were needed, and delivered targeted instruction in a positive and reassuring way.

They have been very flexible when needing to make schedule changes and have always been openly helpful with reviewing what progress has been achieved and what is needed moving forward to achieve our targeted goals.

I highly recommend Bounce Back In-Home Tutoring for bringing your child's skills up and moving them forward to the top.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1599173749729, 'text': "Thank you for the review!

So happy I found a tutoring company that offers amazing in person and online tutoring. Melissa is easy to communicate with, very professional and accommodating. Bounce Back Tutoring has helped me tremendously in prepping for the GRE. They have also done a great job tutoring my little cousin in math, science and English. We've both seen significant improvement. Can't thank Melissa enough!!< /review>

I am so happy to have found a tutoring service with flexible scheduling that works to pair my child with a tutor that is able work cohesively with my child’s learning style.  They go above and beyond to make sure that your child receives the support they need to be successful in school. Highly recommend !! I have referred several friends who have children that were struggling with distance learning and needed extra support.  They are also very happy with the supplemental help Bounce Back tutoring provides. You won’t regret choosing their services in fact you will probably say “We should have done this a long time ago”<//Text>

Hello! I am a recently hired tutor for Club Z! and so far working, it has been a blast! The communication between myself and Melissa Diwa is great as she lets me know when I am tutoring, who it is, and whatever information I need to help best assist that student. She's been a great boss to work for as she is very communicative in however you feel works best for you and she tries her very best to give you great times that suit your schedule! Overall, all of my tutorees have been excellent with very polite manners and their parents are very generous people!<//Text>

I was struggling in my college Spanish class and decided to look for a tutor to keep my gpa up and found this service. Stephanie is my tutor and she has been amazing ! I went from barely passing with a C to a high B! She is able to work with my busy schedule and last minute scheduling which is great because I never know when I’ll have time with 4 kids. I’m happy I made the decision to reach out for help.<//Review>

My daughter is Struggling in math. My friend recommended bounce back tutoring. I received a call on Friday evening inquiring her needs of services. I explained the area where she is struggling. By Sunday night I received information to start Monday afternoon. They even reached out to the teacher to find out how is doing. This is her first session my daughter seemed pleased.</Review>

<text>Melissa immediately answered my call and rolled out the red carpet. She heard all of my concerns and needs specific to our child and circumstances and promptly found a wonderful tutor for us. Tutor was on time and professional. My teen has anxiety and had a moment when the tutor arrived where he wasn’t ready to get to work. Tutor was so patient and understanding. It made me feel so reassured. Billing and questions addressed right away. Very professional. So far, so good!! Highly recommend.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>I have not been to school in years and was applying to a graduate program. I needed tutoring for the GRE. The tutoring I received was great. We set up a consistent tutoring schedule that worked with my schedule (at the time, I worked two jobs). I was taught not only content (English and math)  but also test taking strategies. I am now going into my second semester of grad school.  Thank you so much for your services.< /Text>< Pics>

I've been working with Bounce Back as a tutor since the beginning of the year and I've really enjoyed it so far. Melissa is very flexible and has great communication all the time. She makes sure you feel comfortable and appreciated and is always trying to arrange what's best for both the families/students and the tutors. Payments are easy and prompt and pay isn't bad. I would definitely recommend Bounce Back for both tutors and families that are seeking tutors.</Review>

As a new tutor for Bounce Back In-Home Tutoring, I enjoy the level of communication between Melissa and the students/parents, it makes everything so much more smooth and easy to work through. As a math major it is fun to help students learn more about and become comfortable with the subject and all related fields such as the sciences. Though math is my specialty I am comfortable tutoring most subjects and this company allows me to stay sharp.< /text>

Melissa is very professional.  She answered her phone the first time I called. I did not have to leave a message. We started tutoring the same week. Bobby was great with my 8 year old.  I am very relieved to have found this tutoring service.< /Review>

Great tutoring company!! My children have done so much better in Math since they started working with them. They were even able to accommodate us even after the Covid pandemic. Very flexible and Julia is an amazing tutor!!</review>

Melissa with bounce back tutoring is extremely prompt and efficient. She replies immediately and works with your schedule and matching your student to the perfect tutor. We love our tutor Julie, and just as we were told would happen, my 7 year old daughter who didn’t want to learn how to read was reading by her third tutoring session. Out of all the virtual learning classes and sessions we have tried, this is the only thing she gets excited about and looks forward to. I think because it’s low pressure, Julie is very kind and patient and encouraging. Thank you for turning my daughter into someone who loves reading!</review>

I am a Children's Librarian and several times a week, I get asked (by parents) for tutor recommendations. Melissa is always the first person who comes to mind.  Everyone I've sent to her has come back saying how much their kids love her and how great they think she is.  She has over a decade's worth of experience and expertise when it comes to education (and special education). Give her a try, you'll be glad you did!</Review>

<Review>My family absolutely loved this service. We are a homeschooling family and have homeschooled for 8 years. But I felt not as competent when my children grew and the level of difficulty rose especially in math. Last year my daughter took her star 360 test at the beginning of the year and only scored a 500 in English. But after a full year of tutoring and retaking the star 360 test at the end of the year her score rose to 1200 and I know it was due to her tutoring.  It made all the difference and she felt way more confident and secure and her self-esteem repaired.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

My son needed a tutor for AP Spanish so I decided to reach out to multiple places on Yelp. Melissa the owner reached out to me and set up a time for my son to meet with one of the tutors. My son has only had 1 session but he really enjoyed it. If your looking for a reliable tutor I highly recommend this company. Super reliable! Thanks Melissa and Stephanie I’m hoping my son does well on his AP test.< /review>

I've been working as a tutor with Melissa for over two years. She is always super helpful and works really hard to match students with compatible tutors, which allows me to focus on helping my students instead of worrying about administrative problems. I am so glad that I've gotten to tutor with Melissa!</Text>

< review>
Western Dental & Orthodontist is the place where the price is right and where your ordinary smile can become a million dollar smile that will continue to shine bright everyday. If you’ve had a complex most of your life because of your teeth, don’t you think it’s time do something about it? Don’t you think you owe it to yourself? 😁 I want to give a shout out to Dr Nee and the entire WD&O staff on both sides for their professionalism, customer service, and awesome job they have done to help keep my teeth healthy and smile looking so so bright. Since 5 stars are the max. I’ll give you a sixth ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ because you are the best. Thank you !</review>

<Review>Got my very first implant tooth started today it cost me a little more than $4,000. I was a little nervous about the implant procedure but it went well but sure enough it was a shock to my system. I was given nitrous oxide and a shot for the pain but after all that there was still some pain. The dentist used several different drills to put the hole in my jaw for the screw that will eventually hold my new tooth. And then he used a ratchet like tool to screw in the metal stud. The worst part was the ratcheting to actually put in the metal stud. It really goes in like a screw. The dentist said it has to heal for three months before the tooth can be attached and next week one week after the procedure I’ll have a check up to see if everything is ok but I can’t wait for my new tooth.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>First of all, if you need something done quick, forget it. I went in for a 3:30PM regular cleaning appointment, didn't get seen until 4:50PM and the cleaning ended at exactly 6:03PM right now. This was the worst wait I have ever done for a simple dental appointment; not to mention, this was my second day going into this place because the first day they didn't have a dental hygienist to do the cleaning. Waste of time.

Second, the attitude of the medical/dental assistants to the patients is outrageous here. With one exception, everyone basically gives you the 'it's your problem, you are on my time now' attitude to not just me but to other patients who waited for hours on end with no update.

Lastly, the one that really ticked me off is that they speak about non-Hispanic patients in Spanish thinking they can get away with keep referring to me as a 'chinito' (surprise, I have a Bachelor's in Spanish and I am not Chinese). I know in Latin America, people assume all Asians are Chinese but they were the ones that obviously grew up here and it's alarmingly to hear that in National City where the majority Asians are not even Chinese. Some respect for patients and professionalism are too much to ask for. Never again.<//Review><user>100973753841234428318< /user><Name>Jungbae Eriel</Name><GmapID>0x80d95225181fd14d:0x5660bffad1bbd6a6<//GmapID>< Date>

<text>I went for an annual check up at Western Dental and Orthodontics last week and I had a very pleasant experience at this office in National City. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Francisco was great and very professional while taking my x-rays and full panoramic images of my mouth/teeth. He was very detailed and walked me through the process. I felt very comfortable while he took my x-rays and leading up to my treatment. I came in nervouse but felt calm as I got my treatment done. I highly recommend this office, and their amazing staff assistant Francisco.< /text>< Pics>

i honestly hate the dentist, but it’s something that needs to be done. beginning my visit i was helped by Francisco who made my experience very pleasant. He was very outgoing and easy to talk too and even got me some goodies to take home. highly recommend asking for him if he’s available for service!< /text>

<text>This post is for my Mom. She had an appointment this morning on 02/17/2020 the medical assistant informed she no longer had insurance Delta. She told my Mom she had insurance with another company. She also told her to go to another location cause the doctor was always late. Called Delta she still insurance with them.

<Text>Don't waste your time with these people.  Was refused service because none of the dentists at this location are "in network" for my insurance.  When I informed the office staff that I would be paying for services rendered, I was still refused service.   On the following day I get a call from Western Dental accusing me of missing my scheduled appointment!  The nerve!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>I feel bad for not having shared sooner. I’m not going to lie...The limited hours here with my schedule are rough to juggle! But because of who works here, makes it worth it.We now have a 3rd set of braces on here in our family. I absolutely love the people that work in this office. I couldn’t tell you the last time I saw any turnover here. Every single staff member that works here is amazing, and that’s why I keep coming back! Note: This is for the Orthodontics Office only. I do not recommend the dental office across the street, unless you have no other options.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>This place is terrible. I recommend you go to another dentist. Where do I start, first of all, they take forever to bring you in and when your sitting in the room the doctor takes forever to come in. If you plan on coming here please plan on staying here for hours so bring something to entertain yourself. Second, they put in silver filling in my teeth WITHOUT my permission. The whole time I thought they were going to fill in with white filling like any other dentist does but they filled them in with silver and now my teeth are super sensitive to cold and hot. Third, the receptionist is nice but the ladies that deal with payment plans are rude. If you cannot afford to get some stuff done they are just rude to you and absolutely DO NOT care about you. Fourth, the dentist automatically tried to give me root canals for everything. I went to a dentist in TJ and they said I did not need root canals in any of my teeth they said. If you plan on getting ripped off by them then your are welcome to go here.</text>< Pics>

Workers there are very nice, but how everything is set up is very unprofessional,  I had an appointment at 10:30am for a cleaning, just a cleaning! They took X-rays, and checking if gums were healthy which is necessary, my issue was that when they had to numb my gums or whatever for a filling. They numb both sides and then after saying “oh we are just gonna do one side only for today”, which made me question, then why did you numb the other side as well. My next issue is that when they were trying to do the filling, I immediately felt the pain in my tooth, and they numb me TWO more times!!! Which concern me because it should not take about 3 injections to numb the lower left side. The third injection did the trick in not feeling the pain no more. Now for my 3rd issue is that I over heard the doctor and her assistant saying “looks like nothing happen”, and because my mouth was so numb I could barely speak or move my mouth! My last issue is that because I had my wire remove because I have braces and I needed a cleaning. I still had to go back to the orthodontist to put my wire back on and come tomorrow to remove the wire AGAIN just to do the next filling! Keep in mind because of this i didn’t leave the dental place until 1pm!!!! Causing me to wait 1 hour until all the orthodontists come back from lunch break just to put my wire back on! So basically I was in the western dental for a cleaning for 2 1/2 hours. Now I’m out here waiting for orthodontist to come back to put my wire on because I need it on, especially if I’m paying for treatment out of pocket! This is my second bad experience here and rather not come back. I don’t have an issue with the workers, just how very unprofessional everything is.<//text>

It’s been a journey with Dr. Nee and the rest of his team. I am happy with the results of my teeth, and now I can finally smile with my mouth open. I not only feel confident about laughing around others, but I also feel proud of smiling with them. Thanks for making a difference 😊< /text>

Everyone is really friendly and everything but what the point if they take a really long time to do some work on you. My mom had an appointment at 9 she was passed to a room and it was 10:12 and no one had gone to see her at all. The place was empty, there where hardly any patients and they still took a long time. They need to get better at this.</review>

Paid a lot of money was gave false information called corporate they did not doing nothing about it. Turns out I did need extractions and they wanted me to pay again from the beginning because it was too late when it was their fault for giving me false information. All I wanted was my teeth fixed but instead they left my overbite the same. After waiting hours on the phone with corporate they did nothing. Nothing at all. I even talked to the manager Melissa from national city and she talked over me and clicked on me. Everyone was just extremely rude. Saying I can’t do nothing about it.< /text>

<Text>Recently visited this office after the Chula Vista location messed things up. Thankfully, this location was able to take me in the next day. I went in to get all four of my wisdom teeth extracted. What they don't tell you is that the oral surgeon only comes once a month. Even though you have an appointment, you should expect to wait for more than 2-3 hours to see the surgeon. After waiting for almost 3 hours, I was finally seen by the surgeon to get my wisdom teeth taken out. I understand that the staff is frustrated by the amount of inquiries from all of the other patients regarding seeing the oral surgeon. I inquired about wait times more than two times and most of the front desk staff kept their demeanor cool and professional. However, there was one front desk employee who gave off an attitude when I asked why certain information wasn't given prior. Once I was sedated, it only took him about 40min to get all of my wisdom teeth out. I was thankful for a speedy procedure and the sedation completely knocks you out so I didn't feel a thing during. What I didn't like was that nobody went over what to expect or do after the extraction. What they sent me and my driver away with was a sheet telling us what to do. It would have been extremely helpful if someone went over this information with me before sedating me because I was left to google a lot of information on how to take care of myself / do's and don't after wisdom teeth removal. I am interested in getting braces through Western Dental but now I'm not so sure after my experience with them at their Chula Vista and National City location.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>I had a 10:00 appt. While waiting in the exam chair, I listened to the Staff continue to talk and laugh (which I'm all for if work is being done). At 10:50 I hadn't received, at the very minimum, a courtesy chair visit or examination. I got up and walked out. I don't think anyone noticed or cared that they were wasting my time.

Funny thing, they send you 50 "we've missed you" texts and when you finally get there, they ignore you. Interested in seeing their insurance claim.</Review>< date>

Went to the orthodontist for a consultation and ended up getting braces the same day ! But turns out they put the most expensive brackets in my mouth (gold) 7,000 dollars! I feel like I was rushed the same day to get the braces  , I put money down . Went back 3 days later after installment and insisted in them taking them off!!! They took them off and now I still owe 3000 for something that’s not in my mouth! The receptionist are nice but it seems like there all out to take your money ! Don’t take your kids here . They advertise braces $99 a month but when you get in there it’s a joke! Never go here !</Review>

All I have to say is DR. Novicio  is the BEST hands down I’ve always felt a little pain by getting a filling but I didn’t feel any barely felt the pressure and also she changed my life by fixing my smile I cried I was so happy if you see this dr. Novicio  thanks again I really can’t thank you enough .<//Review>

I went in for an apt for a cracked tooth and to have it replaced, but instead the dental technician didn’t even kno about my tooth, and said that I didn’t schedule this type of appointment, I went in the first place because I needed my painful cracked tooth replaced,not for fillings, so I had to stop the procedure  because they had numb the wrong tooth  to the right side, and want to use more  Anastasia on the left to take the tooth out.(( checked MetLife for other places accepting medi-cal)) DO NOT COME HERE.

If you work and have an appointment for a child, schedule the day off. The wait time can be between 2 to 4 hours, again that's the wait time. Once your child is seen by the child dentist. Treatment can take an additional hour. Again schedule the day off. This office and any other dental and medical office need to be honest with patients, especially when scheduling an appointment for any type of treatment; be honest of the wait time, be honest and divulge the actual wait time of treatment. Schedule each patient in accordance to the treatment, and pace of the dentist/doctor over booking is not at all what a person wants to see and hear when waiting to be seen themselves. Oh and if you think of going to another Western Dental, no.... they do not transfer your file from one office to another. It's like your a whole new patient which can take 3 to 5 hours (this is to fill out the paperwork,  get xrays, receive treatment instructions, then the actual treatment)</Review>

My Son had an appointment @1pm didn't get X-ray til 5 pm! Then was waiting for the Doctor who just came told my son to open his mouth and left just like that! Then one of the stuff brought me paperwork to sign and I ask for what?  And she said " oh the doctor didn't explain?" Then I had them explain. It was 6 p.m and still no sign of the Doctor!! I had to leave my kids where hungry ! I was so  for the unprofessionally of this place!!.< /review>

If I can give 0 stars I would... they tried to scam me... told me i would have to pay out of pocket due to insurance not covering and wanted me to do a payment plan.... I called my insurance and they said they never recieve a request fo teeth cleaning nor was anything denied. Point is I was covered  I waited 3 hours to just not get anything done because of supposedly insurance didnt cover it. They were rude and unprofessional overall. Taking my money else where and you should too because they were just trying to get more out of my pockets. I am sure they payment plan had some sort of interests:)</review>

<text>WORST PLACE. My appointment was 9:30am, they called me 10:40, after x-ray  they told me to wait for another 30 min, but I could not wait because I had something else to do. I re-schedule my appointment and left this office with no treatment. The ladies at the front desk are nice, but the place's time management is the worst.</text>< UserId.>

<Text>Well, I thought it was a good dentist until they would not pull a tooth that they did a root canal on. Had to go to a different dentist to have someone else pull it. Their lazy, rude and rushing to get you out as fast as you can. I'd recommend that you avoid this place and go to dental express! They secondly seem like they don't know what the heck their doing! The second day I went there, there was a little boy who gotten his back teeth pulled out, turned out the mother was pissed cuz they pulled the wrong teeth out! Adult teeth too! I will never ever ever ever step foot back in that place, nor any other western dental. They just try and get as much money out of you as possible. Ridiculous, since other places take MY insurance yet they won't do what I ask them to do. This place is a rip off and wouldn't recommend it all! I wouldn't even take my child here! They have you wait forever only to just send you out the door getting nothing done.. horrible horrid experience! Worst dentist in America! Find someone else who cares and has courtesy for you! You have been warned! God bless you and hope some of you take this recemendation to heart!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Worst dentist I’ve ever seen in my life. Long waits, insurance doesn’t cover everything and it’s a scam. If you like waiting 3 plus hours and paying for regular cleanings. Go to this dentist</text>

I dont know who’s and what’s wrong with people here. Honestly, the dentist is nice and gave me hope in regards to my braces getting removed today. They said it will take about an hour and half to get it done. Why would they schedule me if their lunch is at 1-2 pm? Now i have to wait another 2 weeks for being rescheduled. This is not the first time I’ve encountered this kind of situation here. You guys need to work on your accuracy and the agreements to the patient.</Review>

Dr. Naeil and Rigo did an amazing job performing the extraction I had done today. Fast and painless. They where very kind and assuring me that everything would be okay. It took away from the nervousness I had. Most definitely will be back for other procedures here at Western Dental in National City.</review>

I had an appointment for 9:30, was there by 9:15 and wasn't seen until 10:15 and that was after being told 3 times it will be just a "few" minutes. She obviously doesn't understand a "few" minutes is 3-4 minutes. Then they wanted to overcharge me for deep cleaning that I was told that I don't even need, that would have been $450 down the drain. READ ALL THE COMMENTS AND REVIEWS, this Place is a SCAM!! Google please create Negative stars. Thanks!<//text>

My grandmother had an appointment today @9am and waited almost 2 hours to be seen (mind you she needs to be on oxygen 24/7 and the portable tanks only carry 2 hours worth) after seeing multiple people that came in after her be seen she told the front office her tank was running low and until then they brought her back just to sit her in a room and have her wait another 15 minutes before a DA came in. The DA had to hunt down a Dentist to see her. After all this bulls*%t all they did was have her sign paperwork and send her on her way.
This office really needs to stop overbooking and seeing walk-ins before appointment patients!! I would never refer anyone to this place! Work on your scheduling and professionalism.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!! && Total Scam ! So glad I went to my second option cause I would’ve have wasted a lot of money on some implants that I never needed!
Got both of my tooth pulled out & all I could say it was the worst experience ever !! Doctor was super rough and did not care if  he was hurting me ! While watching me tear up!I Walked out of there in pain with a ripped lip ! DO NOT BOTHER WASTING YOUR TIME AT A PLACE THAT DONT CARE ABOUT YOU AND YOUR TEETH Especially when they have nothing but dental assistant that are practicing smh ! YOU SHOULD NEVER FEEL PRESSURED OR IN PAIN WHEN YOUR GETTING YOUR TEETH DONE ! POINT BLANK !<//Review>

<text>My first encounter with Western Dental has not been too favorable at all.
The customer service on the phone was totally deplorable. The gentleman named Manuel really had no clue on how to navigate through the system to locate my son's information, who was just seen there the previous day for treatment.  I was on the phone with for 12 minutes repeatedly giving him the same information and he continuously fumbled. He blamed it on being thirsty because he's on the phone and was located at a different location, etc. I feel that there is either an extreme lack of training or absence in sincere care of the patients that call in.  Beyond frustrated and will not recommend anyone to have their care at Western Dental just from this. If I had the option I would give negative 3 stars.</text>< Pics>

<text>Worst customer service ever and as you can see if you read the GOOGLE, YELP or FB reviews for yourself, mine is not an isolated case. I love how they post a response when you give them a negative review. They will post a response and pretend to care instead of correcting the customer service and procedure problems so they can get more positive reviews. I have just one thing to say... Please do your homework save yourself a terrible experience and headache and read the reviews, that many people can't all be wrong!!!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>Girlfriend had a 9am appointment. 9am is when they open... she was stuck waiting on the chair in one of their rooms for over an hour.. staff walking by the door throughout that entire hour. Was told dentist will attend her in a "few minutes." She only came for a cleaning. They told her she needed a deep cleaning, and they only spent 10 minutes on that deep cleaning, no numbing or anything. Was even told it wouldnt be covered by medical. Huge scam. Don't bring your business here, terrible. She didnt get out till 12:30. This was only supposed to be a cleaning, and she was barely attended in those 3 hours.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1501619854979</Date>< userid>

I don't know where these 5 stars are coming from, but this place is terrible! I waited for 3 hours in this place for a filling (which took 20 min.) and they have the gall to not do all the fillings and want me to come back another day! Are you serious!!< /Review>

I went here to make an appointment. The receptionist are horrible. Please go somewhere else. It seems like all there concerned with is getting your information. They are rude and have no customer service skills at all. They have policy's that aren't posted anywhere and they will not direct you to anyone that can help if they don't know the information there selves. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.</Review>

This is the absolute worst dentist office that I have ever been to , I would not even give this place 1 star . First off I sat in the waiting room for 2 hours and then they called my son back and then left him in the chair while the dentist left to lunch. Then they got back (reminder this is just for a cleaning) after it was all done i spent 4 hours there . I have come back for more work to be finished on my son and ive waited 2 hour in the lobby not even seen yet. This place is garbage never come to this place< /Review>

The Dentists and dental assistants are not friendly and frankly unprofessional!!  I had a root canal procedure, which will take 3 visits instead of 2.
The Dentist never introduced herself or addressed me OR explained the process, she just asked me to open my mouth and began to work.  This is very wrong, due to the fact that they can possibly have the wrong chart and end up performing a treatment on the wrong person ending in a lawsuit!!

After the procedure was over, they just left me by myself, nothing was said, no literature was given to me on how to treat my mouth at home etc.

Very disappointed!!!  I will NOT come back here again.  I plan to choose a different Dental office with professional Dentists who offer their patients time, courtesy and care.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>The girls in the front were awesome! I finally went through for X-rays and then an exam. I can't explain how horrible it feels to have not been seen by a dentist for years!

I've went through and read some reviews and I'm not sure how or why this office got so many negative reviews. This was my first time here, I did not feel uncomfortable by any of the staff at all. Jaime (which is pronounced Hi-meh) was super nice. She explained everything to me in basic english (non medical terms) which was great for me And made sure I understood the breakdown of my insurance and my out of pocket expenses! She was kind and gullible and it made me feel comfortable about doing all the work here at this office.

My dentist Ana Mendoza, I loved her! She didn't make me feel bad about the health of my teeth and she was more concerned about taking care of the "here and now" and everything moving along forward. No talking about how did it happen or why I waited so long. That's exactly what I needed from a dentist. She knew to keep asking me if I could feel the drilling and to make a hand movement for her to stop if needed. Awesome awesome awesome! I loved her care for me (as a patient) and just refused to go anywhere else or to make any other appointments unless it was with her.

This review is for those who feel skeptical about this location. I was there for 4 hours and didn't even realize it. Everything went smoothly and I can honestly say.. The best dental experience I've EVER had! Thank you!!</Review>< Pictures>

<review>This dental office deserves NO star. Bad service. Had to wait for 3 hours for general check up and cleaning. I came in for Next appointment only to find out that they rescheduled my appointment because the other patient before me would take 2 more hours. Staff were very disorganized and inconsiderate. Please, do not waste your time and money coming to this horrific place.<//review><name>Diana Tiong< /name>< Gmap_id>

On the dentist side of things:

Worst experience  I have ever had. Initially I came In on a Tuesday and the
co-worked took two hours to finish my paperwork. I left because I had other things that I needed to do. They rescheduled me for the next day. The lady informed me that tomorrow would be faster because I already did my paperwork. Came in the next day and I waited three hours just to be seen and I had to do my paperwork all over again.

Was not even 24 hrs and they already lost my paperwork. My insurance company informed me I could only go to one doctor that was their at the time. The lady said she understood. After, three hours I finally went in the back they gave me a check up and everything and then the only doctor I could see left. They allowed the doctor to leave knowing that was the only doctor I could see. They then informed me that I wouldn't be able to use the full benefits if I used the other doctor. They are so unorganized, unprofessional and take way to long.

If I had to say one good thing it would be that some of the girls up front are Really kind.</Text>

<Review>Booked an appointment for an extraction. Showed up to my appointment and they told me the orthodontist will not be in until January 19th, 2018.... like why would you even let me book an orthodontist appt if you didn’t have one. Total waste of time. Will not be returning on the 19th because I need work done now.<//Review>< Rating>

going to this place is a nightmare! you have to have lots of time to go to this place. first day we went there we stayed at the clinic for good 3 hours just for cleaning. the second time i went there i have an appt they said im not in the system.. showed them the appt card and the text from them for my appt.. they said the doctor cant see me too... i ask for a refund because we already put a down. the manager made me wait for almost 2 hours....<//Text>

<Text>Western Dental it's a bad nightmare, it's like being in a Jason horror movie. don't even waste you're time. It was like going to a cheap TiaJuana dentist. I went to the National City office, was told I needed a root canal so I made a follow-up next thing I know they cancelled on me 3 times without notice and told that the only endodontist, in the entire county was in Oceanside. That's is a 50 Miles away, plus traffic and time spent at there office. Why don't they have more endodontist in the intire county it makes no sense. So if you have SD Plus insurance from San Diego  Unified School district don't even waste you're time getting it through Western Dental it's a great waste of time</Text><userid>103705841466716975613<//userid>< GmapID>

Took my daughter and kept having issues with her insurance and it got fixed. My husband made his appointment on a Tuesday for the following Saturday. Saturday, he took the day off work and an hr before the appointment we called to verify since the voicemail, text and initial appointment center said 1:45 but they argued it was 2:45 they call to say they couldnt verify the insurance so we needed to reschedule. We did. We set up an appointment for the following Tuesday he requested to get off work early and when we show up they once again they said they couldnt verify the insurance. We called the insurance and they called the office but yet they said their system was down and they could reschedule which at that point we had been there for over an hr and our insurance said we shouldnt have any issues because they would cover it. I asked to talk to the person in charge of verifying since she had over a week to do so and she didnt and they said she was on lunch and they couldnt tell me if it would be 30mins or 2 hrs. They werent professional at all. The first 2 of a family of 4 in the same insurance had issues i wasnt going to wait around for the rest of us. Needless to say we switched to a different office who verified our insurance before setting up an appointment and were more professional. I dont recomment it especially as a new patient. Unless you have time to wait around for them to do their job. I have 2 toddlers and my husband a demanding job. We dont have time for that. I wanted the convinence close to home but much rather do the drive and be seen at the time i was told not an hr after a scheduled appointment if and when they verify the insurance.</text>

Literally very bad customer service, denied access to see my wife claiming "she is finishing up" when that didn't work changed to " she doesn't have you as her 3rd party" which is a plain BS not even mustard on top cuz wife called me asking me to come to her, then statment changed to "doctor said no" ..wife came out saved their doors from getting smashed,  me and my wife both suspect the work done was unnecessary and was done for insurance fraud and money scamming, going in for a second opinion next week will keep you guys posted,
don't think anyone would wanna get tested that way do yourself a favor and go anywhere else even a free clinic will treat you better than this too bad can't put negative stars.< /Text>

Called to make an appointment for my daughter.  They took all my information, name, phone, address, etc.  They gave me the time and date for the appointment but refused to give me the location of their office?!?  They said it was confidential !! Since my daughter is an adult they refused to give me the address.  Needless to say I was incredulous.  Their office location is top secret !!< /Text>

<Text>This place is terrible, the service is less than professional, and they absolutely refuse did not want me to go in with my daughter.
The receptionist was so serious and unfriendly, I thought I was in a morgue. Please avoid this place at all cost. Cheap yes, but horrible service.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend this place, it is horrible, Dr. Leila, I do not know how she can be doing the work that she does when she is working on your mouth, she is talking with the person who helps her and she does not focus on what she is doing, she did a job for me. very bad I left crying from there very sad and depressed do not go to that place I do not have insurance and I am paying more than 20 thousand dollars and I am very disappointed that doctor I do not know how she became a doctor is badly educated please be careful with she may have dementia because she forgets what she is doing

(Original)
No les recomiendo este lugar es horrible la Dr Leila no sé cómo puede estar haciendo el trabajo que según hace cuando está trabajando en tu boca está platicando con la persona que le ayuda y no se concentra el lo que está haciendo a mi me hizo un trabajo muy malo yo salí llorando de ahí muy triste y deprimida no vallan a ese lugar yo no tengo seguro y estoy pagando más de 20 mil dólares y estoy muy decepcionada esa doctora no se cómo llegó a ser doctora es una mal educada por favor tengan cuidado con ella a lo mejor padece de demencias porque se le olvida lo que hace< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Excellent service, very organized staff, there is a bit of a waiting time but it is worth it given that the service is very friendly today. Dr. Novicio did my exam and Mayra was very attentive and at all times helped me and explained every question I had and he spoke to me in a very appropriate way regarding My doubts in such a way that I understood every detail of my treatment.
Without a doubt my experience with the dental visit was wonderful.
Thanks Dr. Novicio and Mayra.
