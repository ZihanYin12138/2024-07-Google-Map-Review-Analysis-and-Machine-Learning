Many workers in the warehouse gave my son the information needed on how to find the correct type and sizes of lumber he needs. The people who cut the lumber for my son are very patient and helpful. Great people! Thank you for the great service!</review>

<Review>Buyers beware. I paid extra for lumber that they call “exposed” which means the lumber will be installed somewhere a customer will be able to see and is exposed to them so it must be of higher quality. They loaded a pallet in my truck with two nice boards at the top. When I get to the job site and unload the materials I found only the top two boards of good quality and the rest you can say was trash lumber. When I called the lumber yard to complain they laughed and said I should have checked the lumber and that if I wanted to return it , that there is a 25% restocking fee. Needles to say I won’t be returning to this lumber yard anymore.<//Review></record>

Clearly Nichol's Lumber motive is profit.  Which is unfortunate because I have made the switch from a big box store to shop local and ended up getting ripped off for unusable materials.

Worked with the purchasing manager Rick Deen who guaranteed me a solution in person for there brittle/flaking birch and then ghosted me.  I ended up having to go in person and he told me in the most condescending manner that it was me and not that and that he owes me nothing.

(We do custom fabrications on the daily for some of the biggest musicians in the game and directly for the largest music festivals in the country - with out a doubt there's no issue with our experience or equipment)

This is what's wrong with small Business these days is they forget they are also the little guy and that us small players become there large contracts.

If you're looking for a place to pick up lumber that respects and values it's customers I can assure you this is not the place.

This place is not worth the hassle that comes along with it.< /text>

I grabbed a 5 pack of stickin sanding disks and saw the price was decent. I come to find out that the price is for each disk. Thats insane!!! Thats how they get you, you buy a few things and dont know that you paid a crazy amount for the sanding paper.
I dont even think they can sell them individually, who the hell goes and buys one disk?

<Review>My father placed an order for a pergola project. When my father arrived to pick up his order and load, he notice a number of issues with the order. The lumber wood was beaten, chipped, warped; out of an order 56 pieces, about 8 pieces were good. When addressing this to the office, a rep said, “ this wood adds character,” and another said, “we won’t replace the piece because it wood be too much work.”
After going back and forth, my father just asked for 4 10 ft 4x6 beams and 4 8ft 4x6 beams, and canceled the order.
Later, my father went to a different location for the lumber, the beams that were form Nichols were all not measured correctly. All the beams were cut incorrectly and short about 2 to 4 inches.
This establishment was all a headache and horrible service, I have received better service from Home Depot.<//Review>< pictures>

First time I bought lumber for a complete new 3600sqft house was in 1993, great service and expert help, made my project easy. My last business was this week, great experience.  Ask for Margarita,  she is awesome and very helpful, brought experts to my attention. Come to Nichols if your project is organized, otherwise go straight to Home Depot.</Text>

I order 4 pieces of lumber yesterday and they told me it will be available until the next day in the morning.i accepted it and paid for it. Within the next 30 mins the called me and told me they mad a mistake and won’t have it available until 12pm that day . I called back to try work something else out with a smaller pice of lumber and they would not talk to me about because I had to talk to the person that placed my order which was Vincent . They said they would leave a message for Vincent tO call me beck within 30 mins that day and they never called me back. When I Sent someone to pick it up today they told me that it’s not ready and I have to wait. So I called the lumber yard and asked what time it would be ready and  their response was that they don’t know and when I asked if I could talk to Vincent they said he’s not available. They are unreliable and unhelpful. If I could give a half  of a star I would.<//review>

<Review>Ouch! Watch out for the expensive hardware tools. They don't price match even if you show proof of a lowered price. I needed a special deck tool right away and they had it, but was $12 more than the competitors.  I could have ordered from another company with free shipping, but couldn't wait 3 to 4 days since I need it.< /Review><Response>None< /Response><Pics>None<//Pics><user>117068057909562936562</user></record>

< review>
(Translated by Google) They are cheats, they deduct 20% of what you are going to return and when I asked them why they said so much that the notice was there, I answered that why they did not put that they would charge that amount so more than one we will not set foot again There, without a doubt, they like to steal from customers, being that thanks to the ones we bought, they are a more or less good lumber yard because neither ganhal lumber does that anymore !!!!!

(Original)
Son unos tramposos te descuantan el 20% de lo que vayas a regresar y cuando les pregunte que por que tanto dijeron q ahí estaba el aviso les conteste que por q no le ponían que cobrarían ese monto así más de uno no volveremos a poner un pie ahi sin duda les gusta robar a los clientes siendo q gracias a los q compramos ahí son una maderería más o menos buena por q ya ni ganhal lumber hace eso!!!!!</review>

<UserId.>112505382735548927165< /UserId.><text>We checked out several window replacement businesses, before deciding on Cobex. What impressed us the most, besides the product, were the people. After a hiccup, they were on it immediately and were honest and up front about getting it fixed. Not only did they get it fixed, we ended up with more than we had paid for. We love our new windows, great installers, neat, clean and very hard workers. We will definitely use them again, this company has integrity.</text>< Date>

Dmitry, the designer, came in and guided us through the process of selecting materials for our remodel. He is very helpful and knowledgable about the intended work. When the job began, he brought in his crew, Alex and Alzhan to meet us and go over the plan.

The crew came in everyday on time and worked through until 4 pm because we had asked them to not work past 4 pm. When they left each day, the work area was secured and clean. Usually we were gone by the time they came in but we came in just before quiting time to see what all had taken place that day. At that time, Alex would explain what had been done and what the next steps would include. At that time he would ask us if there were any other things we wanted to know about.

The crew was very respectful of our home, protecting the flooring in the traffic areas, neatly stacking materials and equipment by the end of the work day.

Our master bathroom is only 5'X10' and this job took 2 weeks. Thanks guys, we love our new bathroom.</Review>

Cobex did a great job on our siding and windows! The communication was great, and the materials and workmanship were all top-notch.  Based on my experience, I definitely recommend Cobex to anyone looking for a great siding or window replacement contractor.<//Review>

<review>Cobex and the entire team were very professional, courteous, on time each day.  The quality of their workmanship is a 10!  They demolished our roof and replaced it with a beautiful new roof.  We are excited with our new roof.  They responded quickly when we had questions and worked great with our insurance company to make sure everyone understood the process.  I will use them again if the situation presents itself.   Thank you again for all you did for us.!!!!</review>< Pics>

<Text>I recently purchased this home about a little over a year (14 mos ago). My husband and I decided to redo the windows. We got four estimate and cobex had the best price and quality and it is backed up with two warranty.  No business would back up there products  if they know they are good. We are very pleased with our windows.
They are professional and do good work. I am so happy with my window. I notice the temperature difference already we have several picture windows that would make are home very hot in my house. My house feel much cooler during this time of the year.  I have 35 windows and two sliding doors.  Max and his crew were so patient with us and explained how the work was going to be done.   I was so pleased that when I told them to start at the lower section of the home they comply with my request. You can’t go wrong with upgrading your windows they make a big difference. Thank you Max and to his crew.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I scheduled an estimate appointment through Yelp, which makes the whole process much easier. They booked me very easily and the estimator came right on time. His name was David, very cool guy. Walked me through the entire process of what they were gonna do and how they were gonna do it. Very professional and great customer service. They use Owens Corning which is a great trustworthy brand.</Review>

<Review>Their Salesman Julian is top notch. His
Communication was great, he showed up on time and conducted himself with the utmost professionalism. While we weren’t able to move forward with our roofing project at this time, I feel confident that had we done so, they would have taken great care of us. We will definitely keep Cobex Construction Group and particularly salesman Julian in mind for projects moving forward.< /Review></record>

<text>I just want everyone to know what a professional and easy to work with company that Cobex Construction has been for me. I had all of my windows replaced and a new roof put on as well as new heating/ac unit. That’s a big job! Flawless! From what to expect to every penny of what it would cost I was completely satisfied. My sales representative David was very knowledgeable and kind as well as attentive to me every step of the way!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

<Review>We need to replace our patio roof along with a large (99”x99”) dome skylight.  Sergey and Dimitri came to our house and we discussed the options and our preference.  Sergey was most efficient in finding the manufacturer for a similar skylight and he then gave us a quote.

The construction was set to a month later and was completed in a most efficient and professional way. We are very happy with their advice, the coordination of the project,  and the efficiency of the workers ( especially the roofer Paul).  We will definitely use Cobex for our future projects and are very happy to recommend them to our friends!< /Review><rating>5</rating><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

The guys over at Cobex are excellent! They offer financing on small and large projects (Siding, Paint, Windows, etc.) and provide fair priced, concise, clean quality work.

I have many home improvement projects and did not want to finance. Instead I've chipped away at misc. home improvements throughout the past year and Cobex works with us everytime! They are flexible and accommodating and I 100% recommend them to every and anyone looking to paint, repair or replace siding, windows, full kitchen remodeling.

Sergey, Max, Alex and all the rest of the guys are a family business and take great pride in their work. I am proud to have met them and look forward to working with them in the future!</text>

<review>I recently had an experience with David from Cobex as he inspected and quoted us for windows and a roof. He was extremely professional and courteous, as well as considerate for our needs and not just sales.

We haven’t acted yet on the quote as we process the cost and change required but he is an asset to the organization.<//review>< Pics>

David, who visited our property and provided a quote, was professional and friendly. What we appreciated most was his commitment to following up with us when many other companies lacked in communication. We were deciding between Cobex from our good experience with David and another company, but ultimately chose the other company due to its lower price for the same material and workmanship warranties.< /Text>

< Review>
Cobex replaced an old leaky shake roof on my detached garage. It looks great and matches the rest of the house.

I called to make an appointment for an estimate and a helpful lady answered. She had me on the schedule within a few days and even called to remind me/confirm our appointment. (None of the other 3 roofers/companies answered my 1st or 2nd call or called me back over a 3 day period).

Sergey arrived for the estimate and took the time to walk me through the process, make recommendations, and provided a clear statement of work based on what we discussed.

A few things that stood out about the Cobex team:
They are communicative
They had clean and maintained equipment and vehicles
They arrived on time
They handled permits/inspections
They completed the project on budget
They delivered 2 weeks ahead of schedule

Overall, very happy and highly recommend them.</Review>

<review>I needed a new HVAC system badly. No heat. I was going through a refi though and had to wait for it to close before I could make a major purchase or finance. Because everyone was doing refinances the loan took 2 months longer to close.
Cobex knew I was going to need the HVAC installed the minute I could. The day my loan closed they ran everything and got it going. they even came out on a sunday and worked all day to get me heat as fast as possible.

They were extremely professional and their customer service from all their crew was exceptional. I enjoyed working with them. Their finance rates were hands down the best I found as well.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Cobex replaced the 56-year-old roof on my just-purchased home all the way down to the rafters.  Shingles replaced were about 25 years old, but the "deck" was original.

Their salesan, David Leal, ecplained evetything about the roof and how all the different parts of it would be replaced, do there was complete peace of mind on this project.

Both the teardown and installation teams were excellent.  The project was on-time and the site supervisors were professional and kept me updated every step of the way.

i will be using Cobex' services in future for  indoor remodeling of kitchen and baths next year.

Thank you Cobex for the excellent work and the 50-year warranty on my beautiful new roof

<review>All of the workers were very good at what they did and Alex, the foreman, was great.  I was most impressed by the number of teams Cobex had for my projects.  There was a team to install the cabinets, a countertop team, a tile flooring team, a wood flooring team, a painting team, a mold abatement team and a cleaning team.  All of the teams worked hard and did great work.  The project was done in less time than planned and there were no unforeseen charges.  I'd strongly recommend Cobex for any home improvement project.<//review>< pics>

<Review>This was a project started and completed the end of 2018.  I did not rate them on Google at the time.  I am in the Rescue/Shingle Springs area and was having a very difficult time finding a contractor here in the foothills that would even give me a quote.  Cobex was a lifesaver!

The Cobex Construction Group experience was great. Dave Palmer kept me informed. Although we were scheduled to start our project in January, they were able to move it up the first part of December. This was a lifesaver for us, as we had a houseful coming for the holidays. They successfully and professionally finished a week before my guests started arriving. Alex and his crew were great. He discussed with me what they were doing and when they expected to finish. Very pleased with their work!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><time>1571850228331<//time><user_id>113459933337295901702<//user_id><gmap_id>0x809b222146f467a5:0xf2b0411e2090a0c8< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<name>Patti Sauvinet</name><Review>I was contacted by them one week and they sent a person to do the estimate in the following week. They ordered the parts and a team of installers was out within the next two weeks. It took them one day for the install and they did a excellent job. They cleaned up nicely after the work was complete! I liked everything this company did for me!!<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Both Sergie and Viktor were the nicest most professional men I have worked with. They tell you exactly what the issues may be, provide recommendations, and work within your budget. I knew what what happening every step of the way. The customer service was amazing. Any questions were answered quickly and they gave me a great price. The did the work and left the site cleaner than when they arrived. I feel fortunate to have found them.< /Review>

<Text>I have looked at few companies for quotes for roofing, fascia root and HVAC had three different leak in the house from last raining season and my HVAC was a old unit could not keep my house cool when it 97 or hotter. some Quotes are high and some low but extra fee if you don't read the small line and financing was one part of it.  I didn't what my credit pull to much. I was in a pickle cause the raining season was around the corner. I happen to remember Cobex from a billboard on my way to work. I look them up before i call them found that they can do all kind of project and multiple financing options was a Plus so i give them a call David Leal came out to give me a estimate. very informant in their product and service and process of how the work will get done.  He was able to answer all my questions and concern the price was good it what you be paying no hidden fee average not to low or high.  I was able to get financing from them for the project at a good rate as my credit union.
they always in contact with you as project and inspection are being work on you can always call them with question with there cell number. I even have them do my wood siding for my front house too since it was in my payment rage. i say my house look good. my neighbor love the new look. i differently would recommend calling them for any project you may need. they are on my next list of of project i have line up.

We recently had a leak in our roof during the last storm, so I called Cobex and had them come out to give an estimate. They came out the next day, at the arranged time. They were very reasonably priced so we decided to go ahead and have them do the work. Within 24 hours they had set up a time to come out immediately, so they could get the work finished before the next rain. We got the estimate on Tuesday and Thursday they showed up on time and completed the work in about 3 hours. They discovered cracked tiles near my solar panels and took pictures. I went ahead and had them replace the broken tiles, clean the valley, and fix the leak. They were very friendly, professional, and thorough. They even brought some trash off the roof the solar guys had left behind and blew the leaves off of my front porch. Since they are also a construction company, I will definitely be calling them again in the future for other maintenance.<//Text>

Cobex Construction installed quartz countertops in our kitchen, bar and bathroom areas. They set all the sinks as well. Their work is absolutely flawless. Dima, the project manager, is tops in professionalism and exceeding our expectations.
The installer, Alex, was extremely thorough and professional. His work is flawless and he thoroughly cleaned up the site.
Everyone I dealt with was personable and fully explained the process to me. Dima always kept us updated on arrival days and times.
I have referred them to two other friends looking for kitchen remodels.
Thank you Cobex Construction</text>

A couple of roof tiles came loose and slid out of place. Also on another part of the roof I had a broken tile that needed replacing. I called Cobex on Monday, they came out Tuesday to scope the work and made the repairs on Wednesday. They also inspected the roof and reattached some other loose tiles. Outstanding work and response! I am very happy with Cobex.</Text>

I had a massive remodeling of two balconies of 3000 square feet in El Dorado hills. I had dry rot everywhere beyond repair. So we needed to rip it all out and start all over. Cobex wasn’t my cheapest option but they were definitely worth the cost. The took over the project from start to finish including all the strenuous permit process with the city. Most important of all Vazgen and his project leaders were honest honest honest. I can’t stress enough. I own over a dozen real estate and that’s a rare gem to come by in construction business. They instead of hiding their mistake or blaming others would accept and took responsibility for any minor (fortunately nothing major) errors along the way.

We had a patio cover installed and it is beautiful! It went up in one day but It took 3 inspections for them to get the electrical up to code. This was a very easy project that took WAY longer than it should have. They did see it through and make all the corrections but it was a major inconvenience. The other issue that we had is lack of communication. If I didn't call every few days to check in on the status up to the installation I don't know that I ever would have heard from anyone.< /text>

<Text>I hired Cobex to replace a retaining wall in my front yard and they were excellent to work with.
The quote process was thorough and explained completely before the work began.
From when the work began to when the work was completed Sergey called to keep me updated several times during the day.
When the job was completed the results were better than I expected and they performed additional work at no extra cost.

I will definitely be hiring them for my next project.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Everybody I talked to was really helpful and friendly and I was happy with the quality of the work.< /Review><user_id>115901489716059681427<//user_id>< username>

Surgey and his crew did a fabulous job on my parents roof. I stepped in for my parents after 7 months of dealing with AAA insurance who were asking for ridiculous itemization from all the contractors, no one wanted to do this because it was a hassle. So, I called Cobex and explained what was going on with AAA and Surgey the owner was very helpful. He went back and fourth with my parents insurance. Which was above & beyond. Such a professional, helpful and nice Guy, I really do appreciate everything. I recommend Cobex for any contractor needs you have. Our roof looks so nice and they really took great care of us.< /review>

In response to your reply: I was not able to confirm the appointment because I lost my cell phone days before the appointment. But that still does not change the fact that we had a standing appointment that you failed you follow-thru on and showup for. Your failure to keep your word by appearing for the appointment we had previously set has led me to the decision to use another company for years of ongoing improvements on the home I recently purchased. It's very unfortunate that your company lacks the integrity, honesty, respect, and professionalism that your claim to have in your core values.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>From day one when Sergey, the owner of Cobex Construction Group, showed up to give me a free estimate for painting the trim work on my house I felt comfortable and I was impressed by his thorough inspection of the work area, his attention to detail and the knowledge he had in doing his job. I had another estimate which was much lower but I called Sergey the next day, who along with his team started working on the project. They matched the color perfectly, replaced the boards which were damaged by dry rot and finished the job in few hours.
I will strongly recommend Cobex Construction Group to my friends and relatives.</review><user>103522319794169871638<//user>< name>

I read through your review and it's very upsetting and a terrible example of who we are as a company. I will contact you soon to talk to you about your experience."}</response><Rate>2</Rate><Review>Would like to take a moment to write a review regarding our experience with Cobex.  My wife and I consulted with them during the Sacramento Home & Garden Expo this year and initially scheduled an in-home consultation with them for a couple of weeks out.  We never received a phone call to confirm but didn't think much of it because after multiple consultations with other contractors and other home improvement businesses and only receiving confirmations around half the time, we thought this was normal but at least these other folks actually showed up.  We waited around and nobody ever showed up so we called the general business line and they didn't have us scheduled in their system for whatever reason.  While that was disappointing cause we took time off from our work and life schedules, we were forgiving and understand mistakes happen so used it as an opportunity to reschedule with them for the following week.  A week passes and it's appointment day and the consultant scheduled to visit us calls on the day of the appointment 15 mins after our scheduled time saying he was going to be 45 mins late so we rescheduled again.  Another 2 weeks pass and we finally have our appointment in home which happens again 45 mins after our scheduled time but since we've had scheduling challenges, we obliged to waiting around for him to arrive.  Upon arrival, we describe to our consultant what we want to do (new interior doors throughout, crown molding and new baseboards upstairs along with helping us enhance our exterior balcony upstairs to make it a more useable space).  The person we met with was quite friendly and we felt good about the initial consultation and even potentially doing business with Cobex if the price was within our budget.  We were really looking forward to seeing what he would come up with in terms of pricing which he said he would get to us 2 days later.  We met on a Monday and don't like to rush people but by Saturday we still hadn't heard from him via phone or email so I emailed him directly hoping for a response.  It's now going on almost 2 weeks since the consultation and still no word or follow up so we've given up out of frustration and decided to take our home improvement projects elsewhere.  It's disappointing considering how great the other reviews I've read are about Cobex.  We're not sure what happened or their business justification for not following up with potential customers but if one thing I've learned in my professional experience in selling is that you never leave a customer hanging.  If they aren't a good fit for whatever reason, at least have common business courtesy to let them know.  That's just good business practice.  For anyone else looking to leverage Cobex for their home improvements, hopefully this review provides some additional insight / visibility into what you may or may not expect in terms of your experience with them.</Review>< Date>

<Review>Bottom line, these gentlemen are top notch!  I so appreciate their quick response, punctuality, easy to understand communication, thoroughness of plan, a fair estimate, attention to detail, and the work done to perfection.  I will not hesitate to call them for future projects.

Here's my story. After looking for two years and against my better judgement I bought a flipped house.  The home inspection was clean for a 60 year old house, but of course the house has since revealed more problems than I had been led to believe.

Last winter after heavy rains, I noticed some discoloration and dampness on a small section of baseboard.  No major wetness, but something wasn't right.  During the summer I decided to get some bids before winter returned.  Two companies came out, but the solutions they proposed didn't make sense to me and on top of that, both were late for the appointment, one by four hours. Neither one suggested taking off the baseboard to see what may be happening behind it.

Then Alex from Cobex came out.  He was on time, personable and quickly pinpointed what was most likely the source of the problem and explained it in a way that made sense to me.  From there he scheduled an appointment to have one of his experienced associates come out to take off the interior baseboard and to peek behind the exterior siding. He corroborated what Alex suspected was shoddy installation of two new windows and a new slider by the previous owner.  The same afternoon, Alex came out and really spent time discussing a solution and a very detailed plan of action that was easy for me to visualize.  The following morning I received an email from Alex that thoroughly depicted the plan including proposal, materials and timeframe, from start to finish and even included possible contingency plans, in case when further into the walls, the damage was more than anticipated, along with what I thought was a fair estimate for a lot of work that included pulling up and re-stretching carpet, mold remediation, removing and reinstalling base board and exterior siding and trim, sealing badly installed windows and slider, caulking and painting inside and out.

Alex quickly fit me in to his busy schedule and was sensitive that winter was fast approaching and wanted to get the work done for me before the wet season returned. His workers were friendly, respectful, trustworthy, showed up on time and did exactly what I expected and cleaned up beautifully.  Everything looked flawless, neat and tidy and completed on time. After they left, Alex came out to inspect the work.  He found a few slight imperfections, that I didn't even notice, and had someone come out the following day for a touch up. Just wonderful!</Review>< name>

My word means Everything! Cobex was not holding up to theirs, rather blaming sales fokes for miscalculating square footage rather than standing by word.

Expect a price increased after your original quote through “production”. Cobex management blames frontline employees for mistakes rather than taking responsibility!</text>

<Review>My wife and I contracted with Cobex Construction Group to make improvements, upgrades and repairs to our home in the Ridgewiew Neighborhood El Dorado Hills.  The house is a one of one design by the architect owner that we have owned for 4 years.

My review will be in several parts because  the projects will take time during the winter months.  I can't say enough good things about their estimating and contracting process, workmanship and follow up on all aspects of the work.

From the beginning, getting an initial estimate and many discussions about what would look best  from design through construction was informative and excellent.  Everything was covered, no guess work and full disclosure if there were issues spotted and how we wanted to proceed.

The project consisted of updating the kitchen with new Quartzite surfaces and some appliances.  The Quartzite is a natural stone from Brazil and the backslash is glass subway tile that we purchased from Bedrosians.  We had the electrical switches and plugs updated with Legrand Adorna.  A new Sharp drawer microwave, Bosch dishwasher and a GE Profile cook top hood. The microwave required cabinet modifications and the hood required cutting the stone surround to fit the vent which it was done perfectly.  The cabinet modifications were completed with precision and even the touch up paint for the farm house cabinets matched perfectly.

Our kitchen had solid granite counter tops that were installed when the house was new, 2001.  The counter tops had seams in the granite that went through the sinks and were not level or really match up.

The COBEX crew came in an put down heavy duty paper to protect our Hickory floors. They put up a sheet plastic wall around the kitchen to keep the dust from going into the dining area and family room.  They removed all of the granite counter tops, the island and back splash behind the cook top.

Afterward, everything was spotlessly vacuumed up and taken away.  Next they put down new plywood counter top base and backer board for the tile back splash, nearly 70 SQ feet.  They made all of their templates and off to the fabricator.

The fabricator returned and removed more of the stone surround for the cook top and one wall cabinet.  He had fabricated the counters all, without any seams.  He and his crew worked tirelessly to fit these huge pieces in perfectly.  FYI.  The quartzite is a very hard natural stone and it took extra time to cut and shape.  The tile setter did an amazing job with the glass subway tile and moving the electrical boxes to a high level on the wall.  It sparkles and looks fantastic.

We stood in the kitchen just admiring the stone and the craftsmanship.  We had a party two weeks ago and everyone was impressed with the kitchen and their amazing craftsmanship.

We had all of the rain gutters replaced as the old one were in poor shape.  The COBEX construction group had the sub contractor measure everything and consulted me all along the way.  After the gutters were installed, Alex from COBEX walked the entire perimeter with the gutter fabricator to insure everything was perfect.

We also had the eaves inspected for dry rot, the COBEX crew came though, stripped back 2 rows of tile, removed the damaged areas and replaced everything very nicely.  Alex walked the entire roof with the sub-contractor to follow up on all of the repairs and to insure everything was perfect.

Last will be the upgrade of the 2 HVAC units in a very tight a difficult area.

I'll be writing as these next projects get completed.  With the rainy weather it will take a little longer.

Alex, Vaz and the COBEX team are fantastic and respond to every email or question we have had.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>It's a gas station with a small quick mart. Right off US-101 (or on the way to); gas is more expensive (reason for 3 stars) versus other gas stations further in town. Rarely crowded. Gas station across the street (priced comparably) seems to attract more consumers. Highest quality gas (only Chevron is comparable) closest to home.</text><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Used the air for $1.50 and the gauge was very small and hard to read.  Plenty of time to fill all four tires though, just bring your own gauge.  Went inside and there was a fair selection of stuff with food mart prices.</review>< Pictures>

Tried 3 pumps & all had error messages, attendant inside couldn't figure out how to reset properly...I got tired of wasting time, went across the street where I quickly filled my tank & was on my way minutes later. Won't stop at this 76 again! Issues with pumps & employees...<//text>

Not only did their driver almost run us off the road, I called to talk to them about it and they hung on me both times because they didn’t speak English. Never supporting this business and letting everyone in the area know about it.</Review>

Store hours are stated from 7am to 10pm. I'm currently here Sun 2/17/19 and it's 7:30am and the store is STILL not open. Doors locked and roll down gate down. Very unprofessional. I didnt think store hours were a suggestion or optional.<//Review>

Went to Ride Aid to Purchase Monthly Supplies for the Household Always End Up Spending $300+ a Month at Ride-Aid. It's Been About a Year Since I Moved From Athens over To Compton This Location Has The Worst Service and Always Out of Their Sale Items Thats The Only Reason Why I End Up Going To The Rite-Aid on Imperial and Crenshaw Do To Them Being In Stock and Great Customer Service. Today i Happen to Go In to The One in Compton Cause i Wasnt Feeling The Drive Out There in This Heat. I Was Looking For an Axe Apollo Clear on Deodorant and All They Had Was The White Roll On. So I Decided to Ask For Help and Ask an Associate. I Bumped Into Veronica and Asked Her For What I was Looking For and She Told Me That They Never Carried It. When I Had Bought It There Before In Different Occassions....LIER! That Was My Thought. So I Mentioned It to Her That I Had Bought It There Before,So Then She Changed Her Story to We Are Not Going To Carry It No More. So I Asked In All Ride-Aid's Veronica Told Me No Just In This Location....I Said To my Self You Dam Fool. So I Told My Mother Lets Just GO And Get Our Stuff From Wal-Mart I'm Pretty Sure They'll Have It In Stock and We'll Just End Up getting The Rest of The Stuff There As Well. THEY'RE $$$$ LOST FOR HIRING PEOPLE LIKE VERONICA. I WONT BE COMING TO THIS RITE AID NOT EVEN FOR ICE CREAM.<//Review>

Rite aid besides being incompetent,when you call they rarely answer their phone,several times I had to drive up their and waste gas and time,for them to tell me,prescriptions aren't ready till next day,something I could've been informed about if they'd only answer their phone,and when they answer the phone their'"Rude"even in person you have to catch their attention cause their so busy gossiping instead of doing their job right..  so no star for you guys..<//Text>

Knowledgeable and friendly staff. We went in for help setting up phones ordered online and the team here despite knowing there wasn’t a sale involved were extremely helpful and offered dozens of tips to get us set up correctly and off to a solid start with our T-Mobile service. Thank you!!<//text>

Horrible costumer service!! We went in asking questions about upgrades and received nothing but a horrible attitude from the employee. So we walked out.</review>

<text>My first time into store I was greeted very kindly and only had to wait a few minutes to Be helped with a small problem with my phone. While I was there each employee walked over to me and thanked me for my service to are country,I am a former veteran and also a former LEO. I was taken back by the professional and personal welcome by the entire staff, My next journey into the store was yesterday and again was warmly welcomed by the staff and the manager whom I had not met my first time into the store. Bernadette introduces her self to me and thanks me for my service! She got the services I needed from sprint done for me and I was very impressed by how she was so proficient and her job and her attitude with all the customers, all at the same time!! Congratulations too Sprint for operating such a wonderful staff and Store! Thank You 👍</text>< pictures>

<Text>They are always nice in here. They actually know what they're talking about too. No need to call customer service and get an hour run around on the phone. Just take the 5 minute drive and get the information from them. They're knowledgeable and helpful. They try to save you on your bill too.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80910775a877acb9:0xacd85c9c101cdae8</GmapID></record>

I use to live in San Jose and go to the store by Eastridge Mall. This store in Turlock is 10x better. The service I received from Antonio and Daniel was on point (which reflects on the manager). They had an answer for every question I had. I ended up purchasing 3 iPhones at a great price. Keep up the good work everyone!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Dr. Yung and everyone did a great job with an extraction. This was for my child.  They were able to help calm his nerves and got the extraction done pretty fast. My little boy said he didn't feel any pains throughout the procedure. Thank you.</text>

Best dental experience I ever had! Didn’t have to wait to be seen. I was able to listen to my music through my headset as the dentist did what he had to do. I have nothing bad to say about this practice. Thumbs up!</text>

Very intelligence and experienced doc. I never had any pain. I had a few fillings done here, and a crown, and again no pain. He has a light touch, no discomfort at all. Would recommend.<//Text>

<review>So I havent’ been to a dentist in about a year due to covid, I’ve been quite nervous. When I came here, everyone was wearing a mask. Temperatures were checked. They were able to help put my mind at ease. I was out within the hour. I have an appointment set for January that I intend to keep. They are very professional.Thank you!<//review></record>

VERY DISAPPOINTED. I am a new patient, saw lots of good reviews online but my appointment has been requested to reschedule THREE times already. I have never been to the clinic and every time they just call me on the day of my appointment and told me the doctor is ill (same excuse every time) and need to reschedule my appointment next month again and again.<//text>

< review>
Dr. Norman's outfit tried 3 times to get a crown correct. I ended up visiting the office 4 times over 3 months to get a single crown done. I thought after that things would be smooth; I have been coming here for about 4 years now. BOY WAS I WRONG....the very next appointment I had with them, they were unable to keep due to "family matters"....OK OK OK no worries. I'll just come in later in the week, right? WRONG...3 weeks out. When I expressed my frustration, Aisha (the receptionist) stated she was "accommodating" me, only scheduling 3 weeks out.....!!??!!?? As if she was doing me a favor.....business must be good. I was a cash paying customer (no insurance paperwork/less work for you!), I'll be looking for a new dentist.</review>

Each time I rub my tooth I think about the poor job done on my tooth. Ugh makes me irritated. I feel inferior and helpless. This places causes a lots of discomfort and anger. I would warn those who consider this place for dental. "It's ongoing work" and the work never seems to end. Go to a dentist you know. This dentist is strange. Everytime I eat something there's an area food get stuck. I've been here multiple time for this issue. A little hole lots of trouble. Watch out.< /Review>

The only downside was that all parking around the building is for one hour at a time, though the hygienist made sure to tell me with enough time to run down and add more money.<//Review>< Pictures>

I hadn't been to the dentist in quite some time, and everyone was extremely helpful, and didn't make me feel bad about my lapse in care. I would definitely recommend this dentist to anyone in the market for dental care!</Text>

< Review>
I was once partial of this fine institution. But upon the dawn of the last fortnight, I was awoken in my slumber by a disruption in the cosmic force; Chronic Tacos had changed their menu.

Not only did this shake the bearings of this very planet, but for some coincidental reason, the service too degraded. No longer is this haven for everything proper jubilant with the same quality it used to have. Instead, it has plummeted down to the depths of Tartarus.</Review>

<Review>The service of this place has gone way downhill. The staff is far more rude and don’t cater to the customer whatsoever. And on top of all this a combo is now 3.50 more. I don’t know who made this stupid menu change but I will definitely not be giving them my business for an longer.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1620056427572, 'text': 'We always aim to deliver a amazing experience for each of our guests...and of course delicious mexican food.

I'm only giving them 3 stars because I didn't realize this place was inauthentic. It's a lot like Chipotle, almost exactly, except their guac is free. I'm not a fan of the Americanized Mexican food but this was okay in a pinch. I ordered the burrito bowl with pulled pork, I ate it with chips for scooping, and a Cherry Coke fountain drink. The meat was fine aside from 1 dime sized piece of jiggly gristle but I spotted it early and just picked it out and enjoyed the rest of the food. It was OK on flavor scale I'd give it a 5 out of 10, but authentic Mexican would have been much better. Taco prices are also a little ridiculous for their "street tacos".< /review><Response>None</Response>< Name>

Staff was very mean. Ordered a carne Asada California burrito. The girl told me that it comes with rice rather than fries. Then asked me what meat I wanted haha she then went on to argue with me that California burritos don’t have fries. It’s literally on the menu< /text>

<review>I've always like this place but the portion size has gotten a lot smaller, the price went up, service is not as personable like it used to, staff aren't friendly, and I think the only thing that haven't change is the sauce bar, were the selections are great and very flavorful. For a busy location and very popular spot I'm sure the up keep us hard that compromises the maIn reason why people go there (fOod).<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>This was my first time eating at Chronic Tacos and I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered the 2 taco plate with carnitas and rice and beans. The carnitas was shredded and was tender and juicy. They didn't skimp on the amount of meat either. You can order your choice of meats and they even offer vegetarian choices. My friend tried the Beyond choice and said it was very good.  It is a walk up counter to order but there is seating inside and out. You can add whatever toppings,  which they add on for you and it includes guacamole, one of my favorites. I like that they use eco-friendly serving containers.  They are paper instead of plastic or Styrofoam. Overall,  it was a great experience that I plan to repeat.</text></record>

We were also going for the first time so we did not know what to expect.
The restaurant was clean and ordering was simple.
I had a bowl that I would recommend if I could remember the name. It had everything in it. I will try and order it again on my next visit.
I know everyone in my party enjoyed their meals so we will all be going back when they come out.
Give them a try and you won’t regret it.< /review>< pics>

Owner I hope you come to your senses soon your employees are letting buisness go left and right i was just told i couldn't order 30 tacos as it was to large of an order! Laziness isn't a good buisness practice! You guys just lost 180 bucks that could have taken 20 mins to make!!! But on a better note THANK YOU TACO MESA FOR WILLING TO TAKE MY MONEY<//Text>

<Review>The potato tacos are worth five stars, alone! Fabulously crispy-crunchy, made fresh to order, and includes your choice of toppings, including a generous amount of guacamole.

They're small, but cheap. Get three!<//Review></record>

Would give 0 stars if I could. My friend and I both ordered the chicken burrito and got very sick from it. The staff was not very friendly and seemed completely rattled to the core when attempting to wrap the burritos. By the time the guy had finished wrapping it up, it looked like this burrito had gone through two tours in Vietnam. Have been loyal to chronic for years, but will never be back to this one on 17th Street. This place needs to be inspected by the FDA as soon as possible.<//text>

I would like to find out how to make this right for you, please contact me at chronictacos.westcliff@gmail.com'}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>AVOID this location! This is a franchised location and in NO way holds themselves to the “chronic taco” standard. I got a bowl, I am vegetarian, so I ask for the white rice, when I noticed there was meat in the rice, the associate proceeded to pick it out🤦‍♀️ When I told him NO! He then asked if I rather have a salad, I said yes please. Then he asked if cabbage was ok, THEY HAD NO SALAD, I said sure then I asked for Baja sauce ... the associate put so much that it was not edible. NO FORKS, NO BOTTLED WATER. NEVER AGAIN!!!!<//review>< Pics>

Never disappointed. Great food and portions. The two taco meal is perfect when you are really hungry. Get the black beans and Spanish rice.<//review>

<text>Great tacos and more. Enough said. This is the original that gave birth to other Chronics around Southern California. Pick whatever you want, it'll be great. I go for the fatty tacos or the tostada bowls myself. The store is very small; no seats, and if it's busy, you'll be standing in line for up to 15 minutes to get your food. But the staff will be friendly while you wait, and you'll enjoy what you get.<//text>< user_id>

<text>The donuts are fresh, delicious, and they have a huge variety! Their prices are the best I have ever seen!! We got a dozen mixed variety donuts with premium choices mixed in. They didn't charge us extra or anything! They have breakfast sandwiches and SO much more. Check them out! You won't regret it.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I came later in the morning so they were a little bare for my taste.  But that didn't stop me from getting 48 donut holes for work.  After the first wave we're devoured I knew these were made of the good stuff.  Then I finally tasted some for myself And I have to say they are just shy of amazing.  The red velvet cake was really tasty.< /Review>

The same lady who rung me up was also the cook and made an excellent croissant, egg, and cheese sandwich. She was also very friendly. Their donut when blueberry filling was excellent too. They have a $5 credit card minimum though.<//text>

Nice &  friendly neighborhood donut shop & deli .   Good customer service, good food & donuts and good coffee.    If you go there long enough they start calling you by first name and make you feel at home.   Great place that opens early and closes late !!<//Text>

Absolutely THE BEST doughnuts I've ever had! I definitely have an addiction to doughnuts. If I'm craving doughnuts, I'll eat the first doughnut I get to. Sometimes ill tolerate crappy doughnuts just cus I don't have a choice but that one. And then one day my mouth was tasted the most tasty doughnut with the perfect amount of frosting and the softest and fluffiest bread ever. Lucky doughnuts are better than Winchell's, yum yum and Krispy Kreme. Go to lucky doughnuts for the best doughnuts in the world!!!!<//Text>

Fast. Friendly. Efficient. Professional. Inexpensive. Brought my car in for a rotation. No appointment and they had me in and out in 20 min. Will buy my next set of tires here. Love the birds outside too!</Text>

I had to get my spare tire replaced after a flat tire. They slotted me in almost immediately, and their service was excellent and professional. Highly recommended and they are great people to pay attention to your car.</text>

Fast and so convenient, ppl are very nice and efficient.  The bird menagerie outside the front door is interesting, Some of them may talk, or it sure seemed like they were discussing me as I approached their cages.  Fast and comparable in price to Calderon's which I also have used.</text>

Tomas, Manuel, Victoria, & the entire staff are friendly & professional.  You will NOT, I repeat "NOT", find better mechanics or prices than you will at Godinez.  They are the BEST!

I called in for an alignment and they were able to get me in the same day.  1 hr later I am on my way home and they provide a great service, friendly staff and very pleased with everything.  This will be my new  go to spot for anything tire or alignment related.</review>

<text>Was just hit by Tomas driving in the shop truck in the costco parking lot and he left refusing to give me insurance information. Called police, but they refused to respond due to being on private property. Office staff refused to acknowledge incident and refused to provide insurance information. If this is how they operate, can only imagine the shady things that also go on in this shop. Avoid at all cost.</text><name>J Powers< /name>< Time>

Great service! I had a nut come off one of my tires, I pulled in here and told Tomas my problem. He went to his bucket of spare nuts and bolts and found one that would work for my van installed it and filled tire up. When I asked how much he said nothing!

<review>Great Service. I went in early morning for a screw i found in my tire. He took his time to check all tires and found a 2nd screw. He followed by removing the wheel, removed the tire from wheel and patched from inside of tire, much preferred method. I only was charged about $22 which is very reasonable. I'll be back again.<//review><GmapID>0x808fb641211f8a49:0x3caaed637c9bc45b< /GmapID>< rate>

Fast, polite, affordable, and meticulous. I had a tiny leak, 1-2 PSI per tank of gas or so, in one of my tires and even with the dunk tank it was almost unnoticeable. The guys here found it though and patched it up quickly and cheaply.<//text>

<Review>Called early in the morning to drop my car off for an alignment. They told me to come immediately because they tend to get busy. I decided to make a drive here instead of going somewhere closer to where I live since there were so many good reviews. As soon as I got there they told me they don’t work on Mercedes and to go somewhere else. Huge waste of time.< /Review>< user_id>

Very reliable and honest buisness with competetive prices. I have been here multiple times, including today. I was here for a tire alignment and after Mr. Godinez mounted my truck on the alignment machine, he pointed out that no alignment was necessary😄 He only charged me a minimal fee for checking. I would highly recommend Godinez Tires for any tire or mechanic needs.<//text>

<review>These are very honest people. I have tried to get a tire alignment here, they told me I don't need one and it won't solve the problem I have. They rotated my tires instead, which fixed the problem and was cheaper than the alignment. My horn didn't work once and they took about 15 minutes to figure out why and didn't even charge me for that part. Just just told me where to get the parts I needed. They won't rip you off.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>They have won our business for as long as we live here. The dealer wanted to charge me $200 just to look at my car and told us it was most likely a problem with my tail light wiring. So I took my car to this shop and they said it was actually just the bulb and fixed it in ten minutes. They fixed a problem with my husband's car tire at the same time. They saved us so much time and money and they only charged us $20 for the fix on both cars. Extremely friendly, honest, and good service. If you want a good mechanic, this is your place.</review>< Pictures>

The bolillos Centro Americano and Mexican as well. Cheese from the homelands of different places can be found here as well and creams. Have other stuff as well. Well worth the stop to find out what you like.<//review>< gmapID>

My family has been buying bread from here since before I was born. The bread is excellent and delicious. My grandfather eats the same thing every morning, sweet bread from this location and a cup of coffee. He has been buying his morning bread from this location for over 20 years. Great place and would recommend to anyone.<//Text>

<Review>Great place to grab your morning bread and go. Your lucky if you get fresh bread depending on the time and day. I usually go Saturdays at 9am-10am. The bread is good. The cakes I'm not a fan of.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Parking can be pretty bad at times and the staff is always rude. The good thing is the bread is baked fresh daily and is always really good with a lot of variety and inexpensive...you ask them, where do you have your *insert bread name*? And they just point to a vague bread section and yell 'over there'.</Review>

It's a wowzer! Fresh baked goods all day long. Really huge selection of beautiful cakes to you-name-it's.
You enter, take a tray and fill it up. They have fresh tamales and a small general selection of grocery items.
Their cheeses are exceptionally good.
Best Hispanic bakery I've found "in the hood."<//Text>

Honestly I went because the other reviews. It's not that good and she is pretty rude. Looks dirty all around, it's expensive, there is bread on the floor and people stepping on it and they don't do anything about it. Don't recommended. There are better places with great comparative prices.< /review>

The bread is alright, but pricey. Some of the women workers specially the young ones are rude as if they own the place and even the owner (the lady) is rude too she once charged me 6$ for a piece of cake that is actually 3$ I went the next day and they didn't do any thing about it. And one time I asked if they didn't have any softer bread cause it was very hard and she told me it was the only one they had when there was more behind the counter, thank god the owner(the guy) over heard and made her give me another one. I'd rather go to "el super" for my bread!</review>

For one; their customer service is so bad, I asked them to send me somebody with bread and they didn't send anybody not even a call to let me know they weren't going to send anyone. Two; the man they do send doesn't even change our bread he just adds the old bread we had before to a batch of not even that fresh bread. Three; when I told them to come pick up their bread box they just said ok thank you not even an apology for their bad service.< /review>< Pictures>
