I am so pleased that I found a professional place like Microblading LA that shared a lot of their years of experience and trial and error with us to make us as ready as possible to work in the field. I found Lindsey, Bella, Nogc and Sasha super patient, helpful and very very informative. They would literally come sit next to me until I get the technique down and be confident about it. They try to make it as easy as possible on us, they answer as many questions as we need. All I can say is that at this place they give their all which is quality rare to find.< /Text>

Microblading LA is the place to go if you’re looking for permanent makeup services such as Microblading. As soon as you walk in you are immediately greeted by someone and was directed to my artist right away. The vibe inside is very relaxed and welcoming. Everyone is super courteous with smiles all around.
My artist was Sasha and let me tell you, she is very talented and super awesome!!! I recommend her all the way. She is friendly and very chill. I was a bit nervous but she made me feel so comfortable from the very first second I spoke to her throughout my entire session with her. Sasha is super knowledgeable and knows exactly what to recommend in case you are not sure about what you want/need, like I was. She made sure I was comfortable the entire time with very minimal pain, if any.
So I got Powder Brows done and they came out flawless. It's a combo of microblading and shading which is perfect for me since I had some bald spots on my brows. She chose the perfect color for me and drew out my brows to perfection.
About 6 months later I got my touch-up done with Sasha, which also came out superb! I have nothing but great things to say about Microblading LA and Sasha. I recommend this spot to anyone and everyone and make sure you ask for Sasha when you come in, you won't be disappointed ^_^
Sending a huge Thank You to Sasha and the entire team at Microblading LA!!!<//text>

I flew into CA from WA for a master brow course with Lindsey Ta and her team! I could NOT have chosen a better team to get certified by! They are beyond knowledgeable, patient and encouraging. Lindsey has many years of experience as a microblading artist and you can see her passion in her work! She is an amazing instructor, explains everything well, patient with her students, sets you up with lots of practice, makes sure everything is clear and understood, very clean and most importantly encouraging and knowledgeable. I went in a little nervous and completed my course confidant. I absolutely recommend anyone who is trying to be a PMU artist to take Lindsey’s courses! I love Microblading LA ❤️</Text>

Lindsey went over EVERYTHING we needed to know in order to be successful within this industry. Her and her team were patient and were constantly providing different tips and techniques to facilitate anything we might’ve been struggling with learning initially. I left this class confident and feeling like I retained everything that I learned within those 5 days. They are the sweetest here at MLA. 10/10 recommend taking Lindsey’s class or booking with her/ her team for their services.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80e824f20a16f0e7:0xfaca9ccc7c7d7203< /GmapID></record>

I had the amazing opportunity to learn from Lindsay & take the Brow Masters course at Microblading LA. I had a great experience and learned a lot! I love her teaching style and can’t wait to apprentice with her. I got certified in Microblading, Combo Brows, Ombré/Powder, & live model on the last day. I’m so excited to finally start my Microblading journey and change peoples lives! Thank you so much Lindsay  :)</Review>

I cannot express how honored and grateful I am to have chosen the most amazing team/group of women to guide and lead me in this field. Lindsey was my instructor and she was such an amazing teacher and so knowledgeable through her years of experience but was so willing to share what she knows. Lindsey is so caring, kind, genuine, humble, sincere, and ultimately want the best for you- which is to do well. Sasha, Ngoc, Bella (the other instructor) were my cheerleaders and I just love how positive and caring they are.  They are so fearless and so cool. I will especially miss hearing Sasha say, “you got this!” “More pressure,” “Go! Go! Go!”.  I will miss everyone at the studio and hope to be back for future classes. Thank you MicrobladingLa for everything and for being a part of my journey. If anyone is considering getting started in microblading then is is an excellent place to start.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80e824f20a16f0e7:0xfaca9ccc7c7d7203<//gmapID></record>

<text>Hi Everyone, I would like to say that I had an outstanding experience at MLA academy. I recently obtained my certificate as Master in eyebrows. I was debating myself with other courses out there, but I’m so happy I Chose MLA academy, the support in every step of the way. They responded to every question in detail, taking the time until you understood every stage of the journey, the patience, but more than anything their technique and their signature style, it really make the difference, compared to others. I feel that I learned all I need to know to help beutiful women and men to feel more confident with their faces frame by putting a touch with pair of beautiful eyebrows on them. MLA Eyebrows, If I could choose again, I definitely, choose them again. Going back to get my eyebrows done.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80e824f20a16f0e7:0xfaca9ccc7c7d7203</GmapID></record>

<Review>I am super happy that I chose to take my microblading and shading course with Lindsey at Microblading LA.  She is a super busy artist who takes the time to personally teach her courses.  I realize that the knowledge she shares has definitely got me a head start in this business because she shares information to avoid mistakes that many beginners make.  She is so willing to share her experience to avoid mistakes that she had to go through.  Bella, who is also a part of her team, devoted 100% of her time and knowledge to help students.  Her team even puts together a final supply list to aid students in purchasing all the needed materials, insurance information and sharps disposal.  She additionally continues to offer her direct support after the class by creating private groups to reach out to her.  She has proven to be a great mentor who has helped me in my own beginner mistakes.  She has offered her generosity in offering to help so that I won’t give up.  I appreciate this from the bottom of my heart.  The MLA team truly puts their heart into your success and is not greedy with the information they have learned.  I couldn’t be happier with my experience.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>I was a model for Microblading LA and I'll admit being a model is a little intimidating before you even walk through the door. But being one of the girls who actually does the Microblading must be just as scary. I went in yesterday to get my brows microbladed and Bella and Lindsey were so patient with their students. They were so hands on and made sure their students were doing everything right and explaining everything so well to them. When it came to Microblading the master artist does the strokes and the students then have to follow the same lines they did.

Lindsey and Bella did such a good job making sure everyone felt comfortable and were so nice. I saw other clients coming in and even the girl at reception made everyone feel just as welcome. Microblading LA is so clean and beautiful on the inside. It was such a great vibe and right now my brows are healing but they did a nice job.

I recommend coming here if you want nice brows, or if you just want to learn with the Microblading LA team, or even as a model. Their team is so professional and helpful. I didn't feel like I had anything to worry about my whole time there. I'm so thankful for the chance at being a model and seeing what a great place it was. Big thank you to everyone there that day and even my student artist, she was the best.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I made the decision to tattoo my eyebrows and lips about a year ago. The results are priceless. I have a great symmetrical foundation to work with now. Prior to seeing Lindsey, I would color in my thinning brows and was often left with an uneven shape, not to mention a great deal of time lost. Now with my lips and eyebrows permanently enhanced, my make-up routine has been cut in half. Not to mention I look way better now!

Lindsey and her team are highly skilled at what they do. I highly recommend them for your semi-permanent makeup needs. It will be money well spent!< /Review>

We went in together and the moment we walked in the door the greeting, the personal service and not to mention the look of the place was just five stars all around. We came in a little early and my wife was attended to immediately. Her Artist Julia took over the results were nothing but smiles and a happy wife.  We have since recommended four of my wife's friends and so far two of them were seen and they are all smiles. Thanks to everyone at Microblading LA my wife loves her birthday present and I'd recommend for any husband out there who want a happy wife.</text>< Pics>

I wish I could leave no stars - that's how disappointed I am.  The websites states that there is all this measuring and mapping before they begin to actually microblade.  NOPE.  None of that happened for me.  Instead, I am left with completely lopsided eyebrows, and it's totally noticeable, and I'm out $700.  At my touch up I tried so hard to convince her to even them out but was met with strong opposition and "you're not letting me give you the shape I want to give you".   Who is the customer here?   I even brought a picture and she still didn't listen to me.    Go somewhere where they map out your brows instead of telling you "they won't ever be even".   She kept saying they're sisters, not twins.  Well for $700 they should be twins and at least similar.  I look horrible!!   I'll never go back.  It was NOT worth giving up working out for two weeks!  The young lady at the front desk is not helpful, they don't answer their phone and booking your follow-up is so challenging.  I guess if you go to the owner, you'll be fine but not Julia.  Don't waste your money<//Text>

From the moment I walked into the beautiful Microblading LA studio to the end of my service I was treated so nicely and was so impressed by them!  I was so happy with the results and their work, my eyebrows look amazing they are truly the best!  I definitely recommend Microblading LA as the only place to do your brows.< /Text>

My eyebrows look AMAZING! Got my eyebrows done with Julie Ha and they have never looked this good. She was very thourough and patient. Usually when I go to get services like this the person doing them is always cold and rushes you through your appointment. It didn't matter what was going on Julie took time to get my brows EXACTLY how I wanted them. If I needed something changed or fixed she stopped and pleasantly changed whatever it was. I would 100% recommend her. I have never written a review online until I came to Microblading LA. Thanks again Julie.< /review>

My brows were done by Stacey Corletto (insta: @microbladingla_staceycorletto). Check out her amazing work - its why I chose her. I’m extremely happy that I finally made the decision to get them micro blades after 2 years of researching. Having them microbladed has shaved off 20 minutes of my morning routine. I booked 3 months in advance. I know Stacey will be on maternity leave & she’s all booked. But when she’s back to work, please please go see her. I would also recommend Julie Ha’s work.</Text>

Lindsey enhanced my lip line to make it look more complete since my natural lips didn’t have the same color pink all around the frame. lt changed my life!
lt was a pain to constantly color them in with lipliners that immediately came off when l’m eating or drinking.
l’m so happy ever since l got this done. Lindsey did a great job picking the color to match my lips and blending the liner into my natural lip color. No one could tell they have been enhanced.
My 2 best girlfriends loved my lips so much they ended up getting theirs done too. Lindsey did their full lips (lip and liner) and their eyebrows. It’s been over 2 years now and they are so happy and theiy want more! We have before and after pictures to compare and Lindsey is definitely our legend!<//Text>

<review>I've been skeptical about getting my eyebrows microbladed for months. I was in town visiting family and came across MicrobladingLA. Lindsey Ta, the founder of MicrobladingLA was the artist who performed microblading on my eyebrows.  She is very personable, extremely patient, a perfectionist, and her work is impeccable. I highly recommend MicrobladingLA if you're considering getting microblading done. They were more than happy to answer any and all of my questions prior to, during, and after my microblading session.

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>This was my first Microblading experience and I was well pleased with my artist Tania, and blown away by the facility’s classy decor and luxurious interior setup.

I Googled “Microblading for Men” and one of the first few results were from Microblading LA. I was intrigued by the realistic results and enhancing effects of Microblading LA’s work and wanted those results for myself. I drove from the Inland Empire to LA, a two hour drive, because I was convinced that this studio had the tools and experience needed to give me the best natural looking results.

The process from start to finish was super simple and straight forward. Tania’s customer service was warm and kind, and I clicked with her and trusted her instantly. She made me feel like my desires for my “new brows” were clearly understood, and she gave her professional and artistic opinion.

The final results were amazing and I can’t wait for my second session. I would highly recommend Tania from Microblading LA!

I spontaneously decided to try microblading after watching a video of Lindsey transforming someone’s eyebrows and I’m SO GLAD I did! I decided to apply as a model and they got back to me in less than 48 hours - I was shocked but pleased, and 7 days later I was driving down from Sacramento. Sasha was my Artist and she is the BEST. She listened to all my concerns and the brow mapping process was very collaborative which I loved. She’s a perfectionist which is exactly what you want for a procedure like this! She recommended a combo brow, which turned out fabulous. An all around lovely and talented person, she is officially my new makeup artist forever. Do yourself a favor, visit MLA and ask for Sasha, she will take care of you and you’ll love her work! No regrets here whatsoever, absolutely worth the road trip. I’ve already referred a friend who’ll be heading down to MLA this weekend and I know Sasha will take good care of her! 💜<//review>

I'm writing a review as a vendor who was very impressed with my experience photographing a wedding at the Lindley-Scott House. There was always someone around to answer any questions regarding the venue and the scenery for the bridal portraits was impressive.. finding luscious green grass and trees is not very common in SoCal. To top it off my couple are in love with their photos! Thank you for a great experience! ~Maria from Pink Heart Photography by Maria Evins<//review>

Went here for a friend's wedding. The venue was beautiful and the staff was flexible and accommodating. The price was allegedly good too. The only downside was that their banquet hall could have had better ac. I'm sure it would be fine 99% of the time, but our event was in the middle of a heat wave.</review>

The wedding and reception for my daughter and her new husband last Saturday was wonderful.  Your staff was curtious and the room was beautiful.  I want to especially thank George and staff for setting up the dessert table since Some Crust did not.  I paid extra for them to do the set up but apparently the person who delivered the desserts missed that.  George and company took care of it which helped reduce my stress during a busy time.

I also want to thank you for being so kind and adding another table at the last minute.  Family politics were taken care of because of your kindness :)

Overall, we were extremely happy with you and the team at the Lindley Scott House.

Sincerely another happy mother of the bride,<//review>

We had our wedding ceremony and reception here.  The wedding venue is gorgeous and the food is amazing. We receive tons of compliments on how pretty the venue is.  The best part about this venue is, Diane  (the coordinator).  Diane is very straight forward and explains all the details and fees upfront.. no surprises, no hidden cost.  With her help, our wedding day went very smoothly.  In addition, staffs were very professional and friendly. Our wedding day couldn't be any more perfect!</text>

Our daughter's wedding and reception were held here on May 10, 2014.  I can't tell you how many compliments we received from the guests. Everyone enjoyed the beautiful atmosphere inside the reception area and the outside grounds are gorgeous.  The food was excellent and the service was superb.  The only complaints we received were on the prices at the bar.  We went with a "NO HOST" bar (Guest pay).  No sure if we would go this way again.  Water, Tea and Coffee came with the Venue.  The Cake and champagne toast were included in the cost of the venue.  Service staff were very attentive.<//review>

I recently worked an event at the LSH as a Wedding Coordinator.  It was my first time working with the venue.  I was very impressed with the assistance I received from the staff that day.  Nearly everyone I encountered was eager to help, friendly, and polite.  I truly felt as if I were an extension of the staff and we were all working together for this bride and groom.  From a Wedding Coordinator perspective, I would happily work with Diane P. and her team again!< /Review>

Our daughter was married here in October. The LSH made all the planning effortless. From the onset, Diane was always available to help during our 10 months of planning. The grounds, staff, food and bar were outstanding! My daughter and her husband say the relatives and friends still talk about their beautiful wedding. If you have looked at other venues, then you know, this is a one of a kind beautiful venue at an affordable price. We looked at many places. When my daughter walked onto this property, she said "This is the one!" She has never regretted her choice.</Text>

<text>Though the venue is lovely and the day ran smoothly there were a couple of things i was unhappy with. The salad was not fresh, and the cake was not easy to cut into when my husband and i went to cut our first slice, not to mention it tasted nothing like it did when I went in for the tasting. Also if you want your decor to consist of lit candles do not reserve this venue. NO CANDLE LIGHTING ALLOWED. If you want to get dressed with your bridesmaids do not reserve this venue, if you dont want to be pressed for time do not reserve this venue, if you think your decorator will need more than 3 hours to decorate do not reserve this venue (they only give 3 hours to decorate). Like I said lovely, private venue though and besides those things my wedding was amazing.<//text></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Outstanding venue overall!  My wife and I had an amazing experience with Lindley-Scott House for our wedding.
Diane, George, Scott, and Kaitlyn were a pleasure to work with. Diane was upfront about everything from the start and very helpful in what we wanted. As for George, Scott, and Kaitlyn, they were always attentive towards our needs during the venue even if we didn’t need anything. The location was perfect as it was on a large property which looked clean and elegant with their Victorian style home.
As for food, it was excellent. They do not offer tastings which left me skeptical but they did not disappoint. My wife’s Salmon was cooked to perfection but my Tri-tip was a little over done as I asked for medium (get it medium rare) but their sauce with it was exquisite. The pear salad was fresh and crisp. Potatoes au gratin was mouth watering along with my flavorful asparagus. Dinner came out a little slow but that gave us some time to eat and get some quick photos with guest. They made sure everyone had a hot fresh meal. Many guest had complemented the food. Staff was very attentive in filling drinks and always presented service with a smile.
For the space, it was a stretch since we were at a little under 200 guest which is the capacity but it still worked out. Everything made it more intimate. Only con I have is parking for guest as it is limited inside which guest are open to park on the street. Hiring a valet would have helped.
To sum it all up, we looked at multiple venues a year and a half before we got married and booked it with Diane since dates were filling up fast. We trusted her with her presentation on what she had to offer and she delivered. They are very reputable as they have many awards from Weddingwire and The Knot.  Diane is genuine and sweet as she has a humorous personality which helped sell me to go with their venue 😁. Very professional and accommodating as long as it is within the limitations of your needs.
I would highly recommend them if you’re looking for a competitive cost venue, beautiful location, and love tasty food. I have no regrets as my wife and I had the best time ever with our family and friends. Many thanks to everyone at Lindley-Scott House for making our best day a lasting memory!<//Review>< Pictures>

I have to start off by saying thank you to the Lindley-Scott House for providing us with such a wonderful wedding day! My husband and I got married on 9/9/2017 and we had an amazing wedding! When we first met Diane we instantly connected with her! She is the sweetest and so helpful! She responded in a timely manner to any minor or major questions I had regarding the venue and the wedding day. This is a wonderful venue that gives you the best of both worlds (outdoors and indoors). Not only is it a wonderful venue but it is affordable. The food was amazing and the staff is wonderful. Diane and George were both a huge help and their son was wonderful service during the wedding reception. My husband and I had a long engagement and Diane was by our side answering all kinds of questions along the way. Up to the week before the wedding she would call us and help us through any concerns or questions we had. Most of the time we would end up laughing with her! She always keeps a smile on your face!
The day of our wedding went very smooth and Emily was a huge part of that. She made sure we were all doing well up until the event started and she helped keep everyone organized before the ceremony began. Afterwards during pictures, the staff was walking around offering the bridal party drinks and making sure everyone was happy. My guests continue to comment on how wonderful the staff was and how yummy the food was.
I am so happy that we made the decision to go with this venue as it made our wedding vision come to life. We wanted a romantic, vintage feel to our wedding and this venue gave us that. The ceremony site was beautiful with trees that arched over where the guests sat. The house provided a wonderful backdrop to pictures and great vintage feel. They have a beautiful lawn where we had games out and a gazebo that works as an alternate ceremony spot. The carriage house gave us that romantic feel and fit our guests to a tee. We had a wonderful time making that room a representation of us.
We are forever grateful for Diane and her husband George, as they continue to host weddings and make new couples feel incredibly special on their day. We happened to pick the same date as Diane and George's wedding anniversary, which made it that much more fun planning it along the way with them! This is a wonderful venue and we highly recommend it for your wedding! Wonderful people and a wonderful location.< /text>

My husband and I were recently married at the Lindley Scott House.  From beginning to end, it was perfect in every way imaginable!  Most of our family lives in CA, but for us, this was an out of state wedding.  We first met with Diane who was so easy to work with and really helped me, a very hands on bride, feel at ease the whole way through.  The grounds are beautiful and there are so many great places to take pictures.  Everything was kept right on time, which I so appreciated.  All of our guests were so impressed.  We had staff walking appetizers around during the cocktail reception.  The bartenders were awesome making our signature drinks, but we also had the full bar with all the top shelf options which our guests loved.  The steak and fish was incredible and served hot!  Something you would expect from a fine restaurant, nothing like what I've had at most weddings I've attended.  All of the staff were very attentive.  For all that we received, we would've expected to pay a whole lot more. Thank you to everyone at the Lindley Scott House for making our dream wedding come true!</review>

We had our wedding ceremony and reception at the Lindley Scott House. What we liked about it was that the ceremony site and reception were all in one place, on private grounds that you don’t need to share with outsiders like at a golf course or hotel. It’s the only place that hit everything on our check list and was within our price range. The package we got included open bar during cocktail hour, and then we paid for the tab for our guests the rest of the night, which came out to about $800 for drinks. That’s the way to go. It usually comes out cheaper than hosting an open bar all night. Also need to mention that Diane is great to work with!<//text>

Our daughter's October Wedding Reception was everything she dreamed of.  Lindley-Scott House is a beautiful venue, Diane and her staff really go out of their way to make sure everything is special.  We were told over and over how delicious the food was from the appetizers to the main meal.  Your Chef did a wonderful job, thank you.   I also have to commend your partnership with Some Crust Bakery the Wedding Cake was Spectacular to look at and taste.   Thank you for a very special day.</Text>

<Text>My wife and I shopped around for quite some time for our wedding venue. We finally decided on the Lindley-Scott House (LSH), and I could not be happier in our choice!! The grounds are beautiful (the manicured lawns, the trees, the flowers, the gazebo, the house, the hall), and best of all – they are all yours! This is not some hall in a hotel where your wedding will have the neighboring wedding do the conga line right through your cake cutting!!

The ambiance at LSH house is perfect. It is romantic, bright with lots of windows, the walls and carpet are neutral enough to go with any décor, and the outside areas are stunning! You guests will love being able to go outside to get some fresh air. They can sit on one of the many benches, stroll through the gardens, or sit in the lit gazeebo.

We were absolutely blown away by the staff at the LSH on the day of our wedding. Everyone was very professional. Amanda, the team lead at LSH, is amazing. All staff members went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. We had passed appetizers, which were a big hit. Staff members came and took drink orders from us and our wedding party as we took pictures. They even brought us some appetizers, which was very thoughtful. Dinner service was incredibly smooth. All food came out timely, and drinks were kept full. All-in-all the staff at LSH should be commended on their excellent job, we could not have been more pleased!! We opted for an open bar at the reception (which is a phenomenal value at LSH). As the bride and groom, we did not have reason to go to the bar. However, several guests commented to us about how “bad ass” our bartender was – so we had to go see for ourselves. We were not disappointed! This was one awesome, mean drink making guy!

The food at LSH was great. Our guests raved over the fish and fillet. Everything was cooked as requested, served hot, and full of flavor! The portions were more than generous. Your guests will not leave hungry.

LSH is a great choice for wedding venue for both quality and value. When shopping for venues we were struck by how ridiculous some venues were priced. LSH gives you the perfect mix of upscale at a reasonable price.

And best of all, the owners Diane and George are a hoot. Seriously, Diane is a little fire-cracker and it is a pleasure to have worked with her. She is professional, prompt, and fair. From our first meeting with Diane up until our wedding day, she was always there to provide any help or advice we needed. She answered many questions, provided helpful advice, and helped ease my sometimes worried bride.

We are so happy to have chosen LSH as our wedding venue. It is the perfect backdrop for pictures that you will warmly look back on for decades to come with memories of a magical night. When shopping for your wedding venue, make sure to call Diane at LSH!< /Text><rating>5</rating><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>110185672298326830638<//UserId.><time>1444682916939< /time>< Resp>

Always love coming here. Ask for Mike. He's the older of the 2 regular guys that work there. Be extra nice and have cash ready whet you're paying and you can probably ask for a better deal on whatever you're picking up.< /Text>

A rare experience. Both customer service and their products are second to none. I couldn't imagine spending my money anywhere else. Put it this way, it doesn't matter how far away I am from this place because I know not to do business anywhere else when it's important for you to get the most out of your money and time.<//Text>

They sell all kinds of FAKE merchandise.. everything is bought in bulk from china.. they sell used things as new items.. they have some rude drunk guy reeking of alcohol working at night.. so many better places in LA.. not sure how this place stays open.. probably from the profit margin they make from selling fake goods.. watch this place get shut down really soon</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1548970052186, 'text': 'hi Linda Dao im sorry you had a bad experience but i think you mean another shop. all products here are bought through contractor.second there is no alcohol allowed at our store. third....we dont carry or keep any used products nor do we sale used products. i also have a lot of product made right here in the united states of america...if you like i can show you. i honestly think you have the wrong store...or youre writing this review to negatively affect my store. if ever there is a problem here Linda Dao it is addressed immediately.'}<//Resp>< gmap_id>

The only place I go for all my smoking, vaping, and just good talk needs with my man J!
Ive been coming to this place for the last 6 months or so and Sphinx has the best prices on whatever you could think of. You're almost literally paying wholesale, as I price check very often on sites like dhgate and Alliexpress.
I'll be looking at something new online wishing it didn't have to take a month to arrive only to find it at Sphinx the next day?!
The owner J is very modest and never tries to push for a sale. Gives recommendations according to your specifications. And just gives the best real/sts talk in all of LA!
They just expanded their shop 2 fold so if you haven't been in a while you'll be more than pleasantly surprised!
Call ahead and make sure J is there. He'll hook you up better than anybody, I promise you!< /Review>

<Time>1619816381669< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Dr. Park is the best dentist I have ever been to. He thoroughly explains procedures, cleanings, and treatment better than any dentist I’ve ever had. He makes me assured in the treatment I’m receiving and that I now have better control of my dental health than ever. As someone who has consistently struggled with cavities I finally feel in control and the relief is a weight off my shoulders. I genuinely feel his interest is in me keeping my teeth as healthy and as long as possible.

I drive over an hour to get his office, but it’s well worth it. Please please please consider Dr. Park if you’re considering a new dentist or are new to the area. I can’t recommend him enough</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Peyton Dental is the best Dental office out there! Dr Park is not only professional and kind, but he has a great sense of humor. The staff is amazingly friendly and helpful. You can tell that they really do care! The dental assistant would periodically ask if I was doing okay during the procedure and making sure I was in a minimal amount of pain as possible. Highly recommend!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Dr. Park & his staff were super friendly! They told me everything I needed to know, the waiting time was not long at all unlike some dentist offices, & he was extra careful because of my pregnancy. I definitely recommend having him as your dentist!< /review>

Had to go looking for a new dentist after some changes to my insurance, and found Dr. Park. He came recommended, and he lived up to that recommendation! Office staff was super nice, and Dr. Park was cracking jokes the whole time. Great sense of humor. He explained everything that he was doing, showed me pictures, and made sure I understood what he was talking about. Ms Juarez came in and took care of me during my cleaning, all while being friendly and accommodating.</review>

<Text>Peyton Dental is a top notch dental clinic, and not because of fancy equipment or slick talking staff. They get high marks for their friendly demeanor and first class service, including their kind bed side manner. They are honest and caring about their patients while keeping us informed on our condition and procedures in progress and what is needed in the future. They make going to the dentist enjoyable. I and my family love the team at Peyton Dental and we recommend them highly. The  Reyes Family< /Text>< Date>

It's been pretty hard during this epidemic to do things that normally we wouldn't think twice before all this started, for several months I been living with pain on a dental crown with a root canal infection.  I work out of state so I finally had the time to comeback home and make time for it due to my  work obligations at a remote location. I been thinking for a long while about finding a dentist closer to home especially now that I would have to make several visits to the dentist to get everything taken care of.  I found Dr. Park's website and after reading all the reviews I decided to take a chance and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made. Dr. Park and his staff are kind and easy to talk to, during my first visit Dr. Park recommend me to a great specialist to deal with my issue, he gave me some meds for the pain and the infection, he even scheduled me through his staff for the earliest appointment for a endodontic treatment with Dr. Sue Suh who was able to clean the infection and do the root canal re-treatment. After the excellent work on my root canal was completed,  Dr. Park repaired my crown the very next day in no time. Peyton Dental is a small family oriented group and Dr. Park and the rest of their team are outstanding caring professionals. They operate with state of the art equipment and the latest approaches to dental health. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

I have been going to Peyton Dental for about 5 years now and it is always so pleasant to go there.  Dr. Park is very personable and does such a great job in caring for my teeth.  He recommends what is needed but I never feel the pressure or pushed to have to do the treatments.  It is also a very kid friendly environment.  At times, it would be difficult for me to find a sitter for then 3 year old son at times and Dr. Park would find different ways to help my son feel at ease while I get my dental work done.  I feel that he cares for people in general and very kind.  The ladies that work there are also very friendly.  I would definitely recommend Peyton Dental.  Definitely 5+ stars ⭐️< /review>

Our 2 boys have been going to Dr. Park for over 5 years . He has always treated us like family.  His staff are all very nice, professional and helpful. Dr. Park is honest and fair and makes sure he does the right thing.  He sincerely cares. He did  a wonderful job with our older son’s orthodontics and is now taking care of our younger one. We are thankful for Dr. Park and his team.<//Review>

Amazing service! Right when I walked in I felt comfortable and welcomed. The staff and Dr park went above and beyond and made the process quick and comfortable . Had my wisdom tooth removed and did not feel one thing! They were also very patient when it came to figuring out my insurance coverage! Highly recommend!!!<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>My family and I have been coming to Peyton Dental and Dr. Park for many years. The quality of care delivered is of its utmost caliber and we are treated like family there. Dr. Park is passionate and skillful at what he does. I’ve always loathed going to the dentist but I must say I had the most painless root canal here. My first root canal experience was not that great hence why I chose to remain coming to Dr. Park. I am confident and proud to refer Peyton Dental to my family and friends.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1566095483326, 'text': 'Thanks,  God Bless Your Family'}</resp><gmap_id>0x80c32d61c2218a01:0xe755a206a9a44840</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful dentist, I had a great experiences while to see Dr.Park and her assistant Vida, Dr. Park and his staff are very friendly and professional. Nevertheless, this place is very clean and you can hear your favorite music while doctor is in action , I can tell that they did a perfect job with my fillings ; they did 16 fillings in total so I hardly recommend this place if you want to take care of your teeth.<//Review>

I’ve been really looking for a good dentist to go to.  My search is finally over.  I haven’t felt this comfortable to come in to the dentist who really knows his craft and wants to make sure you are happy with you’re dental work.  It was quick everyone was very helpful and courteous.   I am definitely happy with the work done and can’t wait to be back for future dental work.
Thank you to Dr park and Peyton medical family.< /Text>

<text>I highly recommend this dentist in the Chino Hills area. Dr Park and his quite capable team have taken care of our family dental care for over ten years now. He provided me excellent orthodontic care a few years back and results are wonderful. We have referred many family members and  friends who trust in his care and return yearly as well. Dr Park has accommodated with last minute and same day appointments when needed. Strong moral and business ethics are practiced at this office.<//text>< user>

His staff is extremely welcoming, organized, considerate about my time and they always make sure to fit me in when I need an appointment. AND, he does beautiful work! I’ve had numerous fillings and a crown that you can’t tell apart from my other teeth because they look so good! I am truly grateful to have found an amazing doctor that provides great service and attentive staff.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

So welcoming and professional!  My family and I have been coming to Dr. Park for years and we’ve never had a bad experience. He is professional and personable. He always makes sure you feel comfortable and does a great job in taking care of my teeth. The girls in the front are always so pleasant and welcoming. They’re the best! Dr. Park and staff really make you feel like family and explain things in detail. The rooms are always clean and comfortable. Plus, they have great taste in music! Lol I recommend Peyton Dental, thanks for being awesome! :)</review>

<Text>First time going to Peyton Dental was great. They were quick in taking me in for wisdom tooth pain. Which I feel much better, there is not much pain than what I had when going to the dentist. Prescribed me with medication for pain and referred me to a dentist for wisdom teeth removal. I like this dentist more than the dentist I would go to. I didn't feel uncomfortable at Peyton Dental felt comfortable. It is best if patients have insurance that Peyton dental accepts because if not you have to pay out of pocket. Thank you Dr. James M. Park, Vida, and Leydi for making my dental visit quick and easy.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>These guys helped through one of the worst situations of my life and saved my teeth. That’s right, SAVED my teeth. And I am SO grateful that they did. Whether it’s simple cleaning or having to remove teeth; they can do it for a reasonable price as well. Dr. Park’s office is one of the best offices I know and he can get the job done easily.< /Review>< Pics>

I’m very satisfied with my experience here. The staff was professional and friendly from start to finish. Dr. Park is great at what he does. He made my procedure as comfortable as a visit to the dentist could possibly be. The man is funny and, judging by the fact that we listened to Def Leppard during my procedure, he has great taste in music. I highly recommend this place to anyone.</Review>

My son recently had a dental emergency and Dr. Park came in on a Sunday morning to care for him. We are very thankful for Dr. Park!<//Review>< Rating>

<text>Wow!  This is the place to get your dental work  done.  The staff is amazing. I love that they take care of you and they know what they are doing.
Dr. Park is by far one of the best at making sure what’s the best for you.  He is very nice and friendly.  I highly recommend this office if you are looking for professional staff and a super clean environment.
I had a situation one morning when I woke up for work with a major toothache. It was also extremely swollen. I called Dr. Park and explained to him the situation. He asked me to come in right away so he can further assess the tooth. The swelling turned out to be a growing abscess, due to a hairline fracture on my tooth from an injury that occurred 2 weeks prior that went unnoticed. Dr. Park took care of it immediately. The swelling went down,  the pain was relieved and I was able to go to work that morning.
Thank You Dr. Park!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c32d61c2218a01:0xe755a206a9a44840< /gmap_id></record>

I travel far to see him because he provides only the best care, guarantees his work, and is extremely knowledgeable.  He and his staff are always joyful and make it fun to be at the dentist.  At times, when my insurance didn't cover the costs, he worked with me to make it affordable.  This type of kindness isn't found very often.  I truly appreciate it.

Dr. Park and his staff at Peyton’s dental are wonderful! They have given me a beautiful and straight smile during the time I’ve gone to them while I was wearing braces! Plus they worked with me as far as financing goes since I’m a cash patient! I use to fear going to the dentist but Dr.Park surely changed that for me! He is highly recommended by me, as I refer everyone to him! Thanks again to the Peyton Dental staff for the beautiful smile!< /Text>

< review>
My family and I have been coming to Dr. Park for over six years and we have been satisfied !
Currently Dr. Park just finished treating my son who had an overbite ; the results are outstanding . In addition he performed a surgery to my 15 - year - old son's gums seem to be growing down over his top teeth and bottom teeth .  Dr. Park explained the procedure how he would perform and helped my son feel comfortable . We went back to Peyton Dental to get the stitch removed and the results are PHENOMENAL , my son he can not stop checking out his smile on the mirror ! ! My family and I we are beyond happy that we found Dr. Park.
He is patient , kind and above all a great dentist . I would not hesitate to recommend him to
everyone . His office staff are friendly and makes the clients feel at home . Dr. Park
is punctual , accommodating  with scheduling  and staff are always enthusiastic .
Peyton Dental is High Tech and Modern . That's the way to go Dr. Park ! !<//review>

Have been visiting Peyton Dental for a few  years.  I have never had a bad experience.  I especially like appreciate the time Dr Park spends on me.  Peyton Dental does not over book which allows me to get in and out in less than an hour.  I have been in and out as fast as 15 minutes.  My last dentist was always over booked and I would be there for hours.  Thanks Dr Park<//text>

We go to Dr. Park because we like feeling like we are appreciated as patients.  When you go to Dr. Park you feel like family.  He and his staff are attentive, responsive and prompt.  We keep going to him, even though we've moved a bit away, but it is hard to find a dentist that compares.< /review>

My daughter just started having Ortho treatments for her braces and had to have several teeth pulled to start the process, as scared as she was Dr. Park was smooth, gentle and calming for my child.  Everyone from the Dental Assistants to the Office Manager are very respectful and kind.  They all interact well with each patient and make you feel welcome.

The text reminders are great for appointments and I love that they are open on Saturday's, as a busy mom this is important for my schedule.

Overall, Dr. Park is thorough and quick and always has a smile on his face.  Office is always clean and very well kept.  When you see the team there treat each other like family, that's when you know you'll be treated like family too!</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I highly recommend Dr.Park-he does a great job at what he does. He is very patient and always gives his 100% attention to each of his patients. His personality is the best. I have never met a Doctor like him.< /Review>

I had not seen a Dentist for about 10 years before I started coming here. Let me say that Dr. Park has been very accommodating. I had a load of work that needed to be done and I chose Peyton Dental for all of it. Now my teeth have been better then they have ever been! Leydi at the front is wonderful and every service with Dr. Park and Vidamaria has been a good experience. This will be my spot for all my Dental needs.<//review>

<Gmap_id>0x80c32d61c2218a01:0xe755a206a9a44840< /Gmap_id><review>I was always very nervous going to the dentist and I was afraid of putting on braces. I was always miserable after a visit to other dentists and I thought this would be no different but with Dr. Park and Peyton Dental I can confidently say I like trips to the dentists now. The receptionist is very nice and greets you kindly everytime you walk in and Dr. Park also greets you as a friend. Dr. Park also treats his assistants kindly and he works well with all of his assistants. I would say everyone is very nice there and the equipment and rooms are always clean. They also send out reminder texts for your appointment and it helps because I myself am forgetful and it comes in clutch. I have had my braces on for 10 months now and I can see the results as my teeth went from totally messed up to straight and cleaner than before. My wife and family are amazed at how quickly my teeth got straightened and it’s all thanks to Dr. Park and the rest of the staff at Peyton Dental!

A little update to my review that I posted about a year ago. I recently had my wisdom teeth removed at Peyton Dental and I heard so many stories of wisdom teeth removal being very painful and awful but surprisingly when I got my four wisdom teeth removed I had little to no pain. I went about my daily routine and didnt have any discomfort three days later. The swelling went away pretty quickly as well. The team there at Peyton Dental are very good at there jobs and I would like to thank them again for straightening my teeth and removing my wisdom teeth with little to no pain.<//review>< user_name>

My favorite dentist!!  Dr. Park takes care of me and my mom like we're family. offering us reasonable cash rates. I love his attention to detail and 2 yr guarantee.  He and his staff are awesome!  My mom is diabetic and often needs more specialized attention, so Dr. Park has made arrangements with fellow colleagues to get her the care she needs.  A few weeks ago, I needed emergency treatment and of course, he fit me in between appointments.  Thank you sOOO much.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.  I know quality, and I am willing to drive to Chino Hills from Los Angeles for the best dental care around.  It's worth it. Gracias!!</Review>

<Text>I have been seeing Dr.Park for over 5 years and I must say that each time i've gone, my  experiences have been quite pleasant.  Dr. Park exhibits to be a true professional with his exceptional skills as a dentist.Not only that, he is thorough, considerate, and sensitive to the needs of his patients in the comfort of their experience from beginning to end.  It is very refreshing whenever I come across a person who displays a polite, thoughtful, well mannered attitude toward others and I am glad to have found that in Dr.Park.  Moreover, the staff is wonderful... Kish</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c32d61c2218a01:0xe755a206a9a44840< /Gmap_id>< rating>

My wife and I both go here and love it. Great staff, and Dr. Park is awesome! He definitely takes pride in his work and it shows. We both use to hate going to see the dentist, my wife especially. But now we go with ease, knowing that he and his wonderful staff will take care of us! We both definitely suggest going to Peyton Dental if you need any Dental or Ortho work done!<//review>

Dr. Park and his staff are friendly, knowledgeable, caring, and experienced. The only discomfort is from the initial numbing injection, which is truly minimal. It is completely gone within 20 seconds, never to return! The medication wears off without the usual painful tingling. He is a Korean cowboy dentist who LOVES to give you a beautiful smile. And he will play music for you to distract you, if you'd like! Insurance submissions are expertly handed by his staff. Our family has found a new dentist for life!< /Review>

I had to change insurances about a year ago and picked Peyton Dental because it was close to my house.  I'm so glad I did!  Dr. Park and his girls are great!  I always feel welcomed and they put me at ease during my dental work. I would definitely recommend them.<//text>

Hello Everyone! If you're looking for a dentist or considering a change from you're current dentist I'd like to recommend Dr. James M Park D.D.S. of Peyton Dental & Elegant Orthodontics as that choice.

Dr. Park is friendly, professional and honest as is his communication and integrity. I've been seeing Dr. Park for about three years now for dentures I received from my previous dentist of nearly thirty years.

Dentures don't just happen overnight. There are appointments for fixing your teeth, appointments for pulling your teeth and more appointments for pulling more teeth. This takes an incredible amount of time and money.

La Habra isn't just around the corner and getting to all of those appointments wore on me mentally and economically. Long story short, it was an absolute blessing that I could not only trust Dr. Park, but have confidence in his ability and practices. The true benefit was that Dr. Park is not only close but in my home town.

Additionally, I'd like to recognize Dr. Parks Office Manager Leydi who's  scheduling, billing and financial assistance is spot on. I have been able to contact Leydi and schedule immediate appointments as well long term appointments, which can be done over the phone or by text and is done so without hesitation.

Lastly, I can't end the post without talking about his quality assistants. These ladies are the backbone to ensuring a smooth transition by preparing and assisting Dr. Park throughout the procedure. They are Savannah Dental Assistant, Vidamaria Dental Assistant and Carmen General Manager. Without these individuals a complete and productive day just isn't possible!

I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read this post, Smile and have a great day.< /Text>

I've been going to Dr. Park for the past 12 years for the usual preventive care and occasional fillings. He and his staff are always professional and friendly. He is very honest and trustworthy. I've never had a problem with the work he's done on my teeth. He never tries to sell me more than is needed (i.e. whitening, braces, etc).

Review for Dr. Sandhu:
I had to get my first root canal a few months ago.  Dr. Sandhu ,the Endodontist at Peyton Dental made me feel at ease by walking me through the procedure and making sure I did not feel any pain. She was not able to complete the root canal in one sitting because she wanted to me to get a 4D scan of my tooth to make sure she'd be able to know exactly what my roots looked like and be able to navigate through the curves.  After the first procedure the pain was reduced considerably.  I went back to complete the root canal.  The nice thing was Dr. Park was there to finish filling the tooth where Dr. Sandhu drilled for the root canal.   So, I did not have to make another appointment. So, a few months have past since my root canal and I still have no pain.< /Review>

< Review>
I have never had a good experience at the dentist until recently when I started going to Peyton Dental over by Harkins. Last Dentist I went to tore into my teeth for what he called cleaning and what others would call a massacre. However everybody at Peyton Dental treats me like a friend that has been going there for years and they treat my teeth the same way. As they were finishing up I actually started thinking about how sad it is that I won't be able to come back until my next check up . . . For now I'm just going to enjoy the gentle Novocaine numbness blanketing my lower jaw.   Written by

<Text>(Translated by Google) I have been a patient of Dr. Park for about 6 years and I am honestly fascinated with the results of his work.
My treatment lasted 14 months the first time, as I opted to put brakes on, but Dr. Park and his staff made the time fly by. All its staff is very friendly and they are always ready to answer any questions or concerns you may have. And I would also like to comment that since the pandemic began, they have followed the health and hygiene protocol to the letter, in all possible aspects. They also have payment plans through credit, which for more information, I recommend you call them and ask what your options are if you do not have insurance.
If you are one of those people who are afraid to go to the dentist, here you will not have that problem because they will help you lose that fear. I can assure you. And they speak Spanish. Dr. Park and his team have excellent customer service and the results will keep you coming back again.

Todo su personal es muy amigable y siempre están dispuestos a contestar cualquier duda o pregunta que tengas. Y me gustaría también comentar que desde comenzó la pandemia, ellos han seguido el protocolo de sanidad e higiene al pie de la letra, en todos los aspectos posibles. También cuentan con planes de pagos por medio de crédito, el cual para más información, les recomiendo los llamen y pregunten cuales son sus opciones en caso de no tener aseguranza.
Si eres una de esas personas que temes ir al dentista, aquí  no tendrás ese problema porque ellos te ayudaran a perder ese miedo . Te lo puedo asegurar.  Y hablan Español. Dr. Park y su equipo cuentan con un excelente servicio al cliente y los resultados te harán regresar de nuevo.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c32d61c2218a01:0xe755a206a9a44840< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I’m writing this review, not because I was asked but because in my opinion, this person deserves recognition.  I’ve had two interactions with this person and both times, I came away impressed and confident that our community is being served well.

I am speaking of Channel Jordan, our Operations Manager here at FSTL.  I find her knowledgeable and yet open to suggestions and ideas.  She instinctively employs in her arsenal, techniques that can be found in a successful company’s Quality Management System manual.  Also, her responses are honest and substantive, which I find refreshing.

I believe that she’s an asset to our community and to management trust.</Review>

Jamie Hansen has been our Property Manager for less than a year - and on Day 1 started to make a difference. Jamie is unfailingly professional, polite, friendly - and, most important to us, highly productive. She communicates easily with residents, Board members, service contractors and personnel alike - which serve her well in project management. She has vastly improved our community's relationship with The Management Trust.< /Review>

Adrianna has been just fabulous on coming up with lots of fun things to do.  Especially during the pandemic she was finding exciting games to play online.
She helped to keep the neighbors engaged.  Prior to that she did a great job organizing parties and getting quality bands and entertainment.< /Review>

<review>I am specifically going to comment on Jamie Hansen who oversees our HOA as its TMT rep/manager/forward thinker.  She has taken over for about 6 months or so and the difference from her work and the predecessor is literally night and day.  Proactive, on top of things, keeps excessive notes and comments staying current, follows up, does what she says she’ll do, rarely needing promoting, organized, smart, funny, very capable, goes beyond often, partners with us, and plenty more positive adjectives.  A delight to work with and has changed our relationship with TMT greatly.< /review>< Pics>

Living in an HOA is new to us, we didn’t realize that we would get more than beautiful landscaping and a clean clubhouse.  Thank you to Adrianna Ramirez for your bright and cheery attributes to keeping us all connected through COVID.  The virtual games, online pet shows and your uplifting spirit made things much more fun.  We truly appreciate you.</review>

During this long Pandemic year, Adrianna Ramirez has truly brightened our weeks with the many opportunities to play fun games and to win prizes! It was especially comforting to see and Interact with neighbors who we haven’t seen in a long time, when we played her games on Zoom! Each week, Jim and I have looked forward to playing the fun and challenging activities that Adrianna has provided to our FSTL Community!  It has also been very special to be taken down Memory Lane …. seeing so many pictures of ourselves and friends at our past FSTL Community Events! Throughout the 6 years that we have been residents here, we have enjoyed so many wonderful times with our neighbors. We appreciate all the great activities that Adrianna has organized for our pleasure.😊< /Text>

<username>Rick Enriquez</username><Date>1615922607372< /Date><rate>5</rate><text>After recently purchasing our home, the fun began, renovation after renovation.  Problem  was, I wasn’t in the HOA system yet (due escrow stuff), & therefore, I could not get city approvals for work to be done (and it was a lot!).
When I expressed my frustration to The Management Trust, specifically Jessica Hernandez, she got right on it.  I cannot emphasize enough, how phenomenal Jessica has been.  She took what seemed to be insurmountable hurdles, & blew them out of the water!  The projects would not have even been able to start, without Jessica’s unwavering commitment & support.  The whole office has been a pleasure to work with.

Management Trust and our onsite General Manager, Angie Hill have been a great improvement over our last Management Company. After coming on-board Angie brought on two maintenance people to take care of small things that our last company would contract out, thus resulting in not only savings but also a better preventative maintenance situation.
Our last companies on-site Manager was a good person but selectively enforced the CCRs depending on who you were. All homeowners pay the same monthly dues and all should have the same treatment no matter who you are or how long that you’ve been a resident. Angie does just that.
As in any planned development that has an HOA you always have a very small minority of residents that are never happy with anything. These people think that they’re special and need attention on a daily basis. Instead of bringing their complaints through the correct channels, the HOA Board of Directors, they constantly are going around the backdoor and demanding personal attention from the onsite management, taking up much more time than all of the rest of the homeowners combined. Some homeowners don’t understand that the management companies employees are not “their”employees but rather employees of the HOA. They take their directions from the HOA Board of Dirctors and not from individual homeowners. Angie has always done her best to accommodate our homeowners and acts in a very professional manner.
I would recommend Management Trust and Angie Hill to anyone looking for a new management partnership.<//Text>

How in the world do they have so many good reviews?? Must be employees giving themselves 5 starts because these people are the absolute worse. Make you submit a ton of paperwork for the smallest improvements and then deny you with no explanation whatsoever. Take weeks to respond to anything if they respond at all. Absolutely sucks to have them as my HOA.< /Text>

Great HOA Meeting yesterday. It was run professionally with transparency and very minor dramas. Attendees were briefed at the outset as to how the Board meeting would be conducted. Homeowners interested in posing questions had an opportunity to sign-up in advance or speak at the end of the main meeting. While the stated limit to speak was 3 minutes, the Board always allowed as it has previously more time for "relevant" Q & A. Even discussions  about a children's playground area were lively and interesting and weren't "contained" in spite of an inappropriate "discrimination" attack by one homeowner. The Board President's response was classic and demonstrated considerable patience with this and other attendee comments. All in all, well done!< /Review>

As a vendor for residential construction services, we deal with many management companies and HOA's to complete the property modification documentation. In our experience, nobody is better organized and professional than TMT. They treat their residents fairly while aiming to please. The respect they show their residents and neighbors has been demonstrated to me time and time again. Great Job!< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I served on the BOD for our community HOA 2 years. We made a tough decision to change our previous management company do to a lack of professionalism. What a difference our change to TMT made! They are a very professional and proficient company. Definitely a huge difference from our previous management provider. I would definitely recommend them.</review>< Gmap_id>

Both Lydia Martinez and Leahna Lopez have been exceptionally helpful and courteous during my move to Palm Springs.  Very quick to respond to all questions and also courteous.

I visited the four seasons Terra Lago in Indio and let me just say that it's beautiful, they have all the amenities you could ask for! Plus more! The staff is Awsome!!! The GM Carl was very professional, Rita had an answer for every question I asked.  Adrianna the club manager was amazing and great at her job.   Channel was so positive and informative   very helpful,  Briana made me feel very welcome like I was in great hands,  and Charles was so great at knowing just what I wanted.
They are the most knowledgeable and friendly group I have ever worked with and I just wanted to thank you for having me and helping me at the Lodge in Terra Lago. I definitely will keep coming back :)
You ladies and gentlemen rock!
The Management Trust has a great team here at Terra Lago
Thank you,

I have worked with three wonderful young ladies at The Management Trust for several years.  Kari Martin, Michelle Reese and Cassie Gertz are simply amazing.  They are real pros in what they do.  Their job is a service type function and they are very, very good at what they do.  First, they listen to you and try to understand the situation or concern you have.  They work with you to try and "fix" the problem as much as possible.  They are always warm and friendly and willing to do what they can.  They make calling or talking to them a real pleasure.  One thing that always stands out is their efficiency.  Once there is a problem, they are on it.  It won't sit and linger; it gets resolved very quickly.  They have a very heaving workload, serving a HOA of over 900 homes.  Somehow they always have quality time for you.  They are very proactive; always looking ahead to mitigate potential larger issues.   I can't think of three nicer, hardworking and effective people to interact and work with.  Our Fairways HOA is most fortunate to have three of the best.  Walt Lloyd< /Review>

< Review>
I deal with property Management companies on a daily basis. I found that, The Management Trust sends the most time educating their PMs on customer service and collaborative thinking to solve property management challenges. Their staff is cooperative and attentive to issues that come up at their properties. At The Management Trust you are family.<//Review>

I receive email notifications and in order to retrieve the info I need my account number. Of course I have all my account numbers memorized."NOT". It is the most cumbersome site I have ever seen. Then once I get into the site there are several divisions within. I want to know what is transpiring in my community but Management Trust makes it very difficult.<//text>

I had previously left a 1 star rating because of the poor customer support I experienced with one of your employees Toni, and still experience it everytime they direct my call to her even though I make it clear not to. I’m adding a couple of stars because of your other employee Chris Olivet, he seems to get the job done and he actually listens and explains without attitude. You guys need more employees like him.</text>

When we called them, they stated we would have to wait 10 days for a refund.  When we went to the Trust Office approximately 12 days later, we were told they only issue checks after the 21st of the month. We called the Trust Office on October 26,2015, and still no check. The only person you can talk to in the office is the receptionist, and if you want to talk to anyone else, they send you to their voice mail. You might get a reply in a few days if you are lucky.

<Text>"2 THUMBS UP FOR TONI"
Having just moved into LANTANA community,  dreading with yet another obligation that comes with the joys of moving, i finally decided to give them a call to have my name added to the entry gate keypad name finder.  Figured it would be a huge pain with me driving to them and paperwork...etc.
Toni handled my request seamlessly within minutes.  She already had the info she needed.
I am very impressed thus far with The Management Trust Monarch Group..
Now if I can convince them to work on upgrading our much anticipated private dogpark, that'd be glorious!
A bench, pottybag dispenser and trashcan would be great for starters.
So would the sprinklers being adjusted to less than the current 8 hrs a day of watering.(ok, I might be exaggerating just a little)
I'm chosing to remain optimistic.<//Text>< Date>

This is the worst management company. We are so eager to get out of this community because it is in disrepair. When I send customer service an email, they send it to the HOA president who in turn tells me to clean up the trash when I see it. For $160 a month, I refuse to pick up someone else's trash. The grass is overgrown regardless of the water shortage--it's still overgrown, ants bite my feet, they allow people to swim with clothes in the pool and do nothing about it. I was talking to the Monarch employee and she witnessed this and did nothing. You have got to be kidding. The grass is overgrown, trash is all over, bouganvillas are overgrown, and they allow for the HOA president to give the gate code to anyone. Monarch takes their check and the home owners suffer. I have got TO GET OUT OF HERE! Do not join an HOA with Monarch at the helm--you will regret it!<//text>

Aside from being friendly and safe in their covid procedures I just got one of the worst haircuts ever. Wasn't expecting a barbershop type quality fade or anything, especially asking for a high and tight. Idk what this is but I had to say it was fine so she didn't ruin it any further. 3 stars from my experience here (2 visits) and 0 stars for the cut....yikes.</Text>

<Review>I had not had a haircut for 6 months due to the pandemic.  I had already started growing out my gray hair before then.  It was long.  Nina cut off all the old blond and gave me a short haircut.  It dried out beautifully.  I love it.</Review>< Rate>

<Time>1566004767812</Time><Review>I was excited to get my son's haircut to start school day fresh. I was thinking it's worth the price I'm sure there professionals. I paid $18 dollars for a fade that they said they couldn't line up his hair in front and couldn't do line ups on the sides either. I did not say anything I just paid oh well what was done was done they messed up my kids exciting day for school I could of done a better job probably or even an $8 dollar hair cut place. Because that's what it was worth $8 dollar hair cut</Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I recently went in for a trim for my already shot hair. I specifically asked the stylist NOT to cut the top and back, as it was already short and I only wanted the area around my neck and ears trimmed. I mentioned this more than once. She talked and cut and cut and cut. The result is an extremely short cut over my entire head. It’s as if she did the opposite of what I explicitly requested. I am VERY dissatisfied and feel awful about this horrible haircut. I couldn’t have been more clear with my request. I will never go back. I want to hide until my hair grows!<//Review>

I usually have my friend cut my hair but she is Downtown SD and I live in Fallbrook, so even though it's just a good tip.. The time and traffic make it not worth it sometimes.. I went here in an emergency and I have to say the haircut I received was AWESOME.. One of the best.. haircuts I've ever had.. Will definitely be back..< /review>

<Review>Sometimes they’ll have good ladies but trust me if you get someone that doesn’t seem like they know what they’re doing, they don’t.

Well to start of was not very welcoming at all and was told that it would be a 30 minute wait which was not the case at all my wife and sat their for a good hour and that is being generous with the time and saw others come and go and apparently is more of a popularity contest rather than good business educate. On top of that the 5 women working their were very rude from the start and was not notified of if we were next and basically of a lot of patient customers existence and when I have been to other locations it has been a very nice experience but for some reason this location has a very bad problem with rude employees very bad business etiquette and no appreciation for its customers two very big thumbs down</review>

I went in with long hair and came out with the most perfect pixie cut! I thought it would turn out horrible, but it turned out amazing! I look skinnier and I am so perky and happy! I highly suggest you get Torri for your haircut! She's brilliant! She has been at it for a long time, and she does a fast cut with AMAZING talent! She was so nice and helpful! I will be returning to her!<//Review>

I called on a Sunday morning to make an appointment. Spoke with Erika. She sounds nice. If I have to sit and listen to someone talk about life, Erika would be a good voice to hear.< /Text>

If you come in 15 minutes till closing they deny you. I was next in line and they told me they were booked for the night. I just got off work and I needed this haircut badly I will never go to supercuts again.<//review>

<Text>I went in today not knowing what to expect. I hadn't gotten a proffesional cut in a long time. As ive gotten older my sir has changed and ive had trouble trying to find out what to do with it. I had the pleasure of meeting shea today and she did the best job ive ever had on my hair. She was informative and understood my hair type I walked away with the biggest smile!! Thank you so much Shea!!!!</Text>< Pics>

It was 50 min until closing 2 people working. One person was waiting and I walk in saying I need a haircut and they say they are done for the day. Never plan on going there again.</Review>

<Review>The only place to go!!!! Better than any other places in the area (I checked out all of them).

I am European, and the American nail salon standards are terrifying to me... at some point I didn’t even want to get my nails done because of how bad the service was- my nails were burning while taking off gel manicure, my cuticles were bleeding, and the polish would peel off after a few days.
I went to Zin Nail with my nails in a very bad condition and they made them look all nice again. The service was very professional, the place was in pristine condition( which really is unusual in my experience), the tools they use are new, the towels snow white and clean (contrary to Hana Nails in Marina, or any Nail Garden where the towels seem not to be changed since the opening). They painted my nails very precisely, and corrected with a small brush ( which is the right way to do but for some reason other places don’t do that). Moreover, something I have never experienced in US nail salons, even instagram famous Modern Pamper or Laqued, they tried out the polish color on one nail first for me to accept (sometimes the color turns out different on your nail than on the sampler).
At the end, my hands were moisturizer (with cream from a separate designated container, not a nasty big box laying around open all day and touching different clients skin (I have experienced that too), and my hands were wrapped in in warm towels.
The whole salon was spacious and designed in a way to give clients privacy (again, not like most chain places cramped like a railway compartment).
Before entering, they check your temperature and do a COVID questioning.
Again, this is the only place I will go from now on, and I have been looking for a nail place for over 1.5 years and was always unsatisfied.
I appreciate that Zin Nail and Spa keeps the standard so high, even though they don’t have too (other places just do the bare minimum).
My brother owns a nail salon in Europe and was always outraged by my descriptions of places here, except Modern Pamper in Burbank ( however they charge 90$ for gel manicure). Zin Nail offers equally good service, charges 33$ for gel manicure and has much more convenient location.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0_87Yo4caEWhwmjV3RsW1ezAdclQLfZq0CmWQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

FRESHLY RENOVATED! Such nice ladies that give you great service beginning to end when you come to their nail spa. Cool dude that’s always in a good mood at the front desk.

I got a gel manicure and pedicure with callus treatment ($76). They lotion AND massage your feet and hands. Also hot towel before nail color application. All their tools are fresh out of a plastic envelope for all new clients which I LOVE!

Definitely coming back to this location with friends!<//text>

The nails here are wayyy too overpriced for what it really is, and my nails aren't always done exactly right when I'm paying $30 for regular acrylic nails no diamonds none of that. The customer service is whatever they don't go out of their way to help they're not that friendly the customers are even more friendly than the staff and that says a lot about the place. It's not worth it I only came because I needed to get my nails done and was already there but they're not the best nail place. If I'm going to pay $30 at least make it worthwhile for the customer! I got my nails done by Susan in case anyone was wondering.<//text>

I enjoyed my experience here very much. It wasn't too busy when I went with my friend, so they were able to get us in at the same time. Very sanitary and not rough at all when taking off my gel nails. There was a professional feel to the place. Most customers who came in seemed satisfied with their experience. I will definitely be coming back to get my nails done here.< /Text>

<Text>Worst pedicure I’ve had even though the staff was friendly. It wasn’t clean nor polished and my toe nails were not cut symmetrically. On top of that, they did two different colors for my nails and toes... total mess. However, the gel manicure lady (the young one) did an amazing job!<//Text>< pics>

Worst nail shop ever! I’ve paid for a gel manicure and within 2 days my nail polish completely chipped off my right thumb. I called and they said to come in and they will take care of it. So I did and 3 days later the polish came of and my nail broke off. Never has that occurred to me.< /text>

<Review>The worst pedicure I’ve ever had. Not only was it a waste of money but I spent over a hour and a half just for a simple basic pedicure. The person who serviced me thought It was okay for me to walk out after paying 40$ for my polish be completely uneven and all over my skin, my acrylic was applied so thick The price definitely doesn’t match the service. Not sure if it was the smell of a water leak but over by the pedicure chairs was a horrible smell.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I have been a patron of this nail salon for the past several years, although reluctantly at times. This morning I arrived a little after 10:00 AM and was treated very rudely as though they were doing me a favor to do my nails.
My nails were brittle and breaking after having a gel treatment two weeks ago. The man that was doing my nails said that the previous person did not apply the basecoat and that is why they were so brittle.
Usually the nail stylist speak to each other in Vietnamese  very loudly and make a person feel that they are talking about the customer.
This will be the last time I have my nails done there and I am not the only person who feels this way.
Writing this review only because I’m hoping they will step up their game. I want only to  see success for our neighboring businesses.< /review>

The worst experience ever. People  walked in before me and got service while others sat around and ate. This by far was the worst service I have experienced. I will be contacting the better business bureau. Money does not have a skin color on it and I will NEVER give them another dime of my money. I have never left a business so angry and disturbed to the point where I knew something had to be done. I will contact whoever to make sure this business is looked at and inspected . I asked for DIP and he said they had it but proceeded to tell me he was doing gel but charging me the DIP price. I had to let him know they are false advertising and they neeed to tell their customers they only do a few DIP colors . Please please don't go to this businesss!!!!!!!'nn

<user_name>Monica Salguero<//user_name><Review>I had been many times at this place and almost all experiences were great, I went for my birthday on January the 5th I had the worse attendant ever, who first of all I think she was upset cause she burly got the chance to finish her lunch, I explained her like 10 times how I wanted my nails and she kept on doing her own thing, she sent me to wash my hands and ask her, are you through filing my nails and she's like yeah. And I showed her that I had all the acrilic powder stuck between the skin and nail underneath.. long story I ask the one who was in charge of the spa to take a look and actually ask for someone else who could do a better job and the way I wanted and he ask me to wait like 30 min for another person, so I decided not to keep waiting and ask him how much is it? He was changing me the full price of the nails and I said I'm not gonna pay for somenthing I didn't ask for and I didn't like and they weren't even done, so he said oh well then I will have the same lady taking them off so I said ok.. I had some other lady doing the nails for me.. but no kidding I'm never going back, who wants to be stuck 4 hours in a place for my birthday and receiving bad service..< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Please do NOT go here. I was running errands in the mall and to save time I decided to get a gel mani and pedi here and they did a horrible job. The pedi was decent but the gel mani was horrible I was almost tempted to go to my regular nail salon to get them done over.</Text>

Over priced, but rude at times. Small portion of staff is professional, efficient and quick. No longer my first choice.< /review>

<Text>I smudged my nail, and they said they didnt have time  to fix it but if i wanted a full manicure/pedicure they have time for that 😂. Terrible service, they base their time spent on how much money a person is spending.< /Text>< response>

< review>
Dr. David performed knee surgery on our 15 year old son this summer. It was an unexpected surgery and we were concerned because he is a high school athlete. We consulted with many different doctors and once we met Dr. David we knew he was the right choice. He came highly recommended by his peers and we felt his surgical approach was going to give our son the best shot at a healthy future. His staff was amazing and Dr. David is incredible. He was calm and took the time to explain everything to us and to our son. He made himself available to answer any and every question along the way. The surgical facility and staff were wonderful as well. He communicated with his physical therapist throughout the whole process which was comforting to us. I can’t say enough about Dr. David and we are forever grateful that he helped us navigate this difficult journey.</review>

One of the best orthopedic surgeons in San Diego County.  We travel 2 hours to see Dr. David. My son had shoulder surgery in 2019 and, again, in March 2021 (both shoulders). Absolutely no complaints! Amazing doctor & excellent surgery center.</Text>

<Text>Dr. David is the best orthopedic surgeon I've utilized during my history of injuries through the years. He's straight forward and will tell you if you should have surgery or not.  His office staff goes above and beyond.  If you get an orthopedic injury, go see Dr. David. You'll never regret your decision.< /Text>< pictures>

My daughter had acl surgery two years ago. Still can’t walk. The surgery wasn’t done properly and nerve block was done with wrong medication. Still no feelings in calf. The doctor never did touch her knee after surgery only had aids check progress. When she tried to follow up-with concerns no one called her back.  He is not a good person only cares about his fees< /review>

Dr. David is beyond excellent. He and his staff are experts at Knees and Shoulders. From the moment you begin you feel welcomed and informed. My daughter had her knee fixed up and I had my shoulder looked at (after seeing how Dr. David handled my daughter it was a no-brainer!). Every once in a while you get lucky and encounter excellence when dealing with complicated nagging body issues. I can’t say enough how impressed I am with Dr. David and his staff - beyond excellent!!< /review>

< Review>
I have had progressively deteriorating knee pain for years. I went to Dr. David expecting that I would need knee replacement surgery. He suggested that I wait as long as I can and instead receive a series of knee injections. They have greatly reduced the pain and allowed me to continue to workout. I appreciate his honest and cautious approach.<//Review>

*Laterjet
*ACL
*Collarbone ORIF
*Hardware removal

Since both my laterjet and ACL surgeries, I have not had any problems with stability in my shoulder and knee. I have been able to return to the activities I love and not have to think a ton about being limited. The other two procedures very smooth and haven't had a ton of issues.

In my interaction with Dr. David, he's been very personable and makes a point to understand your desires post op and tailor his treatment accordingly. Dr. David is very willing to help you understand your options and the consequences of each procedure and answer any other questions you may have. It is evident that he wants to do what's best for his patients and get them back to the activities they love as quickly as possible. If I ever need another surgery (hopefully not the case), I'll be going straight back to him.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Dr. David repaired my rotator cuff that had supposedly been “repaired” by another surgeon. Then he repaired my torn ACL from a skiing accident. He has also repaired my husband’s knee and shoulder. All of our surgeries performed by Dr. David were very successful, and we don’t hesitate to recommend him to our friends. He’s not arrogant like so many of his peers; he has a great bedside manner. I can’t say enough good things about him and his staff!!< /Review>< Name>

I underwent knee/ACL surgery with Dr. David more than a year ago.

In my pre-op appointments, I was told that my "knee will be better than its been," and that I "won't regret this" surgery.  The reality could not be any further from those rosy and assuring words.

I was told I could start jogging about 3 months after surgery and playing sports 8-9 months after surgery.  Well, more than a year later, I am still struggling with walks around the block.  Before my surgery (on a leg without an ACL), I played sports a few days a week, took long walks in the evening, and enjoyed hiking vacations walking 20 miles a day.  I never had any pain.  Currently, I no longer even dream of playing sports, and the ability to walk long enough to go on a real hike seems unfathomable.

After more than nine months of what seemed like shockingly little concern and outright dismissal from Dr. David about my pain (he never ran any follow up tests), I was left with no choice but to seek the help of other medical professionals. At such time, I was informed that I would need another surgery and that my bones, tibia and femur, were misaligned. Yes, imagine how it feels to walk around like that for nine months. Also, half my lower leg at this time is still numb from my knee to my ankle. That is definitely not supposed to happen.  Dr. David will send you to his associated physical therapy clinic because it is owned by the same medical group and they make money from it.  This place is not necessarily your best option.  Do yourself a favor and shop around, I found better therapy elsewhere.

I could write ten pages describing the physical pains I have felt and still feel, the hopelessness I felt when going to my post-op appointments, and the sadness I continue to feel for how my life has changed.  I wish I could go back in time and undo this surgery.

I only write this review in hopes that is saves another person from my same fate.  Please think twice about whether you really need any surgery at all.  I wish more than anything that I had my old leg back.  If you decide you do need surgery, please run away from this doctor while you are still physically able.< /Text>

<review>Dr. Tal S. David did extensive shoulder surgery for me in approximately 2013.  He is without a doubt, the top surgeon and M.D. I have had.  His follow-up for PT and care is excellent.  I feel fortunate to have him as a M.D. Highly recommend this Docdtor.<//review>< Pics>

<rate>5<//rate><Date>1574882251762< /Date><review>I give the absolute highest recommendation for Dr. Tal S. David’s office. I was referred for my left Knee ACL surgery to Dr. David’s office by my Sports MD and several colleagues who worked with Dr. David for their varying injuries .
I arrived to Dr. David’s office right after meeting with another surgeon in the area prior, and was immediately blown away by the customer service Dr. David’s staff offered- especially in comparison to my prior meeting. I barely waited more than 5 minutes to be taken back to my room where I sat and chatted with the PA (Kyle) about my bilateral ACL tears for more than enough time. I didn’t feel rushed out of the room, nor did I feel like I was taking up too much of Kyle’s time. Kyle was sincere as he sat with me and guided me through the entire process of what my surgical recovery would be like, and gave me his cell phone number to text him should I have any questions. It was right then and there that I knew I wanted to go with Dr. David’s office for my ACL/Meniscus repair surgeries.
After getting fitted for both my post surgical and recovery knee braces, Kyle left the room to get Dr. David, who came in immediately to chat. Kyle sat in the room with Dr. David and I the entire time and even helped remind me of certain questions that I had wanted to ask the surgeon. Dr. David took his time discussing the different graft options, and after a few minutes of chatting, I knew I could trust Dr. David to operate on me.
The next day I got a call from Jazmine in scheduling at Dr. David’s office who worked with me on my insurance to obtain authorization so I can get my surgery the very next week. She understood the difficult situation I was in given my high deductible, and Jazmine was such a terrific help through it all. She was extremely knowledgeable and patient, and helped schedule me ASAP for my first surgery. She referred me over to Maribel in the office, who immediately assisted me with my disability paperwork for my employer and for the state disability insurance, which added to another relief that Dr. David’s office offers.
One week later, I met Dr. David and his OR staff at the Coastal Surgical Center at 6AM  for my 730AM knee surgery and was again blown away by the customer service the staff offered. My father (who flew in from NJ to help care of me) and I felt extremely comfortable and well taken care of and I was successfully in and out of the OR within 2 hours. The very next day I received a call on my cell phone from the RN in the OR who wanted to follow up and see how I was feeling and answer any questions I had lingering.
My girlfriend took me to my first post surgical appointment with Dr. David 8 days after the surgery, and even she was blown away by the entire office staff’s amazing compassion and care. We took two boxes of Donuts from The Donut Bar as a simple thank you for the way office staff took care of me.
I am looking forward to a speedy recovery so that Dr. David can operate on my right knee acl tear in the spring and give the highest recommendations to anyone looking for a trustworthy surgeon and staff.

PS.... i have seen other people recovering from ACL surgery and their incisions are garbage in comparison to Dr. David’s<//review></record>

Probably the most impressive doctor I’ve ever talk to. In one visit, we accomplished everything we wanted to know. We got a Cortizone shot for my wife and then got an MRI after that. We knew that my wife would eventually have to have surgery. We didn’t have medical insurance at the time but he treated us with great respect. The only problem was that he didn’t accept our type of insurance or we would have gone to him.</Review>

Dr. David is very professional and really knows and loves his work. My personal opinion is; he is the best #1 doctor, that I’ve ever seen.  He was at a different location when I started going to him and I have followed him  throughout the years because he is one of the best.< /review>

<text>To counter another review my father had surgery on his shoulder a little over a month ago. Initially, workman's comp would not approve his surgery. Dr. David went out of his way to schedule meetings with board members and got it all squared away. It was transparent to my father because Dr. David and his staff or nothing short of professional. Now, lucky me, I too have to have shoulder surgery. As long as Dr. David's office takes Tricare I will be seeing him as well.< /text>< pictures>

Two of my kids suffered with kneecap subluxation. We went to countless Doctors, and it was always the same, PT and knee braces which did nothing to resolve the issue.  Dr. David was the first who said PT and knee braces would not fix the issue,  surgery would and he could do it.  He did what he said he would and my son made all CIF Defensive POY and earn a scholarship. He was amazing.<//Text>

Dr. David was asked to speak with workers comp doctor to see if they could resolve reason why it was not approved. I have called at least 5 times to find out anything. If they talked to doctor or the workers comp doctor had not returned calls. Find out today that workers comp doctor tried on 4 separate occasions to get a hold of him. He never returned a phone call. This is the worst doctor I have ever met. Doesn't return a call to anyone. Staff does not know what they are talking about. I would not recommend this doctor do ANYTHING!!!!!!< /Text>< pics>

He operated my husband's meniscus several yrs ago. Terrible Dr!!! Wouldn't do a thing when I told him my husband was in pain and his knee a day after surgery was extremely swollen. The weekend was coming and he didn't make an effort to give us an appointment, on the contrary he told us to wait until Monday and we ended up in the ER. An ambulance had to come for my husband because he couldn't walk, he was in the worse pain. Save yourself the agony by not going to him.<//text>

They did not even answer the phone. I was not able to access my case information online and their was a prompt to contact them instead so I tried to call them as I have twice before and also did Not reach a human being. I have been on hold now for 56 minutes and getting impatient. If they were on lunch they should indicate the times on their phone message announcing they will not be accepting any call during that specific hour. Absolutely tedious situation trying to get help from these people. Don’t they want me to pay my ticket so They can get their money ?!?!? It’s never been so hard to give someone my money! Too bad I can’t add a photo of my wait time.<//Review>

When you have people waiting 2 or more hours to be called with only 5 people in the room, it tells the community you don't value their time or their purpose for being there. These people have jobs, struggles, and real life commitments just like you. Subjecting them to wait through your "breaks" while they put their lives on hold to address issues (I'm sure they don't want to deal with) is cruel. The lack of regard shown for people is astounding. We are ALL expected to perform our job in a manner that best serves our clients and/or community. If we didn't, we would be fired. The fact that the same culture and work ethics are not instilled with those working for the judicial system is why people continue to have such severe mistrust and disrespect for those working in it. Be accountable and do better!<//Text>< pictures>

That dude doesn’t seem to know anything about actual laws and made terrible decisions in my case. Will be switching to an actual JUDGE. Cowardly behavior.</Text>< Date>

“Apparently a great many people have forgotten that the framers of our Constitution went to such great effort to create an independent judicial branch that would not be subject to retaliation by either the executive branch or the legislative branch because of some decision made by those
judges.”  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (March 16, 2009).
This Courthouse is better than most, so they are capable of 5 star rating. Fight the legislative corruption happening right now.</text>

So how do you rate a court house.  Depends on what you are here for.  But the staff and clerks are helpful.  Good self help center but make an appointment<//Review>

It would seem odd to review a court since you really don't have a lot of "choice" when you are involved in the court system. I have to say that I appreciate the fact that you pull a number to file something (rather than wait in line standing), there is a copier available to the public, the self-help center has appointment times, and there are tentative rulings for some of the cases. In my experience, the clerks are helpful and the judges and commissioners take their jobs very seriously and professionally.<//Review>

The longest wait times for simple filings anywhere! A ticket system (take a number and wait), which has issues, such as skipping numbers after hours long wait. Don't expect the rude clerks to help you, either, take another number and wait at least another hour, or go to hell...THE WORST. Zero stars would be more fitting.</text>

<rate>2</rate><Review>Just like any other government run building, it is a miserable place to be. They need to get more specific when giving out numbers with the machine and front load the people whose business at the courthouse is going to take the least amount of time. I waited for 4.5 hours just to find out the paperwork I was told to bring in was filed online so they didn't need my hard copy... there has to be a better system. People take off of work and waste their day in this place just for 20 minutes of interaction, exactly like the DMV.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809b223409f95f3b:0x1a767a8eae3c528b< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I feel this court is very unorganized... I have had nothing but issues with paper work..it's always screwed up..i was marked wrong in the system they marked me with a felony when was supposed to be a misdemeanor charge.. Thank God.. i noticed it and was able to get it fixed.. Its a big inconvenience when you live hour's away from this county.</review>

<text>Average government help at the family law windows, from nice people at the same old job doing the same old thing. But they are very nice and manage to smile when you know they want to scream and throttle the guy acting a fool on the other side of the glass. Still they smile and tread on because it's probably the best possible job to be had in these times. Smile folks and remember, the clerks only relay information, don't shoot the messenger.<//text>< pics>

The Court Clerk was no help at all. She didn't even try to help me. I had no idea how to fill out the documents I was given. No one told me how to fill out the documents. If I lose my case I blame our Judicial system and severe lack of human decency.<//text>

<Review>This was My first experience at this Courthouse. Although I had no idea what to expect, I was really surprised how kind all of the staff were.  Just last week I had a written declaration due; however, I never thought the traffic window closed before 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. I called the courthouse at 2:55 p.m. and a representative answered the phone and explained that although they close to the public at 3 p.m., they are still there working until 5 p.m.  She then reccommended I drop my paperwork in the outside dropbox and she would be sure to check it before the end of the day so my papers would be date stamped and not late.  If not I would have forfeited my case; so this really meant alot as I am awaiting back surgery as well.  When I arrived, I double checked with security to be sure I put my paperwork in the correct dropbox.  I could not believe the security officer went and date stamped my packet for me. This location was a little hard to find the first time, however; I recommend using GPS.  Nice building, parking free, plenty of spots, and the staff are so kind!< /Review><name>Renee Ray< /name>< gmapID>

So I had to write a review this is my spot they are black owned and they are awesome both owners are so sincere and say hi to all customers. They did have some difficult staff but the saying finding good help is hard is so true. They have changed up their staff and I can say shout out to all the new girls homie on the cash register is so sweet and Rosa makes a really good hearty sandwich. They also carry cookies by Butterpecan bakery also a black owned business 😋.  If you truly want to support black owned business do it! Every business has its ups and downs growing and becoming better is what you should want from your community and they get better every time I see them.

Love Teresa 💘<//review>

<review>First of all I bypassed several options to solicit a black owned franchise, to my dissatisfaction. Unless you like your chicken ready to fly (feathers included) don’t try this place. The moral is very low, which explains why they gave me 2 mixed dark & white meat pieces when I ordered two 4 piece all white piece meals. Plus they forgot my biscuits. I also ordered a large fries, which made my wait time about a half an hour, then they burned the fries (totally inedible) First and last time at this place. Clean up your act, this could be a good choice with a few changes.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

They consistently mess up orders every time I go. Often the workers at the cash register seem rude and not interested with getting specific orders right probably because they act like they are so rushed to put a sandwich together. I can say 8/10 times they get the order wrong. Used to be good but I’m paying for one thing and getting another. Last time I gave y’all chance. I’m going to look for other sandwich shop. This is my first review I’ve ever had to leave on a restaurant.</Text>

Great Sandwich Shop, also serving Crunchy Chicken, nice establishment, with great customer service, love ❤️ the food and the hospitality that goes along with it, “You’ve tried the Rest , but from experience,” They are the Best. Keep up the good work Johnathan’s, and hope your New Year is Bright....< /Text>

The sandwich bread is dry and not fresh. The bread really makes the sandwich. Krispy krunchy side is great. Use fresh bread on the sandwiches and you could be 5 stars.< /Text>

Wow the best Chicken Gumbo I have ever tried! Perfect savory flavor that was delicious. And in a fresh sourdough bowl! This place is my new favorite spot for lunch. The staff were professional bu warm and inviting. If you're in Alameda, Ca., this is a great place for lunch. I'll be back!< /Review>

<Text>This spot has been around for years but was recently bought by an African American couple. They offer Krispy Kruncy Chicken, jambalaya, red beans & rice, crab sandwiches, shrimp, bottled drinks, sweet potatoe pies, cakes and much more. I STRONGLY support black owned businesses and just plain old nice people. They are really family oriented and friendly. 💯</Text>< Rate>

Great sandwich.. Fresh tasting I totally enjoyed it. I was so impressed by the customer service the employees were so engaged with the customer’s. I never felt rushed to place my order and they even recommended bread for the sandwich that I ordered. One of the employees told me that there going to start making hot sandwiches like panini’s for there winter menu. I honestly can’t wait. If I could give 10 stars I would.<//review>

I was wondering what this smell was as I looked around I see one of my coworkers eating soup. I was like omg that smells delicious. She said its from a place around the corner. So of course I went to get me a bowl. OMG it’s called chicken gumbo and it had the right amount of everything. Not to spicy just right. I will be going back after work to get another bowl for dinner.

< Review>
Visited this restaurant during lunch. Attached is my receipt for the pastrami sandwich I ordered. I will not eat there again based on the practices I observed. The person who rang me up handled money and touched food.There should also have a sign displayed informing customers of the charge for cheese. I passed on the chips and threw my sandwich away as soon as I got out the door. Waited almost 15 minutes for a few slithers of lettuce, pastrami, a dab of mayo and $1.25 cheese. They didn't even ask my name for the order but did of the customers before and after me. I had to ask if my order was ready.< /Review>

< Review>
Classic Alameda sandwich shop where everything is made to order. The sandwiches are lovingly made, like you would get while back at home. Quaint and cosy location, where you can sit and enjoy a meal with friends and family.

The chili on a cold day is perfect, or one of their signature sandwiches any time.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Love this place! I stop in for a sandwich or salad every once in awhile but I hadn't noticed that they also have home made soups. Recently while standing at the counter trying to decide what to order, a woman seated at a table behind me told the staff "This is the best soup I have ever had!!" and was raving about it. I said "Whatever she is having - I'll have that!" Turns out it was vegetable beef soup, which probably wouldn't have been on my list of favorites, but I wanted to give it a try, and omg - it was literally the best I've ever had. It wasn't tomatoey like vegetable soups are sometimes, but full of tender but not soggy veggies, and the flavor was really luscious.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Fond memory as a child visiting this place.  It had been closed for sometime and I am glad it reopened under new ownership.  It's a place from the past, that is worth a visit for your family. If you love dinosaurs, then without the sophisticated technology this is worth a stop.  Simple fun in the high desert! Close to Morongo Casino.</text>< pictures>

My husband and I took our grandkids here last week and had a really good time.
If I had any suggestions for this business, it would be that maybe they could put up more signs up to make the walking path a bit easier to navigate.
The prices were fair, I thought.
At the end of the walking trail, there's a humongous T-Rex that you can go in and climb to the top of, so you can look out the windows going along up the dinosaur.
Overall, I would recommend this stop. Especially if you're traveling with children. They will love it.<//Review>

I absolutely loved it. I am quite the dinosaur lover so naturally it was a great time but honestly, it was the child-like simplicity that really hit it home. Mr. Rex was sporting a classy bow tie and Easter tuxedo and Dinny was tatted up with a red heart. The size of these bad boys really helps put into perspective what it would have been like walking with these majestic beasts. I would have loved to have gone as a child as I think it would have left me awestruck and lit my imagination on fire.

The gift shop, which by the way is INSIDE Dinny the bronchosaurus, was filled with cute Dino plushes, toys, figurines, magnets, pins, jewelry, shirts, posters and more. I got the ET themed poster...instead of ET riding to the moon its Mr. Rex on the bicycle to the moon. Love it.  It made me giddy and lit up with joy to dig through all the treasures to be found here. Reasonably priced. Cute little ladies that worked here, helpful, kind and chatty.

Through the gates on the northernmost part of the property(lot opposite of Burger King) the excitement continued with robotic dinosaurs practically knocking you off your feet into the land before time.

Don't miss this family friendly, one of a kind, easy on the wallet, photo op extraordinaire. 5/5 will be back!!<//review>

Yes it's a fun place for kids..... Dinosaurs are very colorful and well maintained.....
Inside area is clean and well maintained..... have small kids playing activity area....
Parking is huge outside.....

Only reason I'm giving 3 star as I have few reasons...

1: we are in pandemic but it doesn't seems inside the area...people are not maintaining social distancing and more over no stuff other than ticket counter.
2: Restrooms are very very dirty.
3: Ticket price, I think bit high...</Text>

<Review>Fun family outing. I wish there were more to see though, our tour ended too quickly. All you need is an hour and you’ll see all Cabazon has to offer. Nevertheless, a nice place to take small children. Love how they change the color of the dinosaur to match whatever holiday is approaching. Such a Valentine’s Day or Christmas etc.. Fun and cool idea to stay connected with the public. I enjoyed my visit. I recommend this place.<//Review>< user_name>

Cool place to bring the little ones! My 5 year old loved it and had a good time. The animatronic dinosaurs were probably the favorite. We stopped on a drive from Palm Springs, but not sure if I would make the trip if living far away as it is a bit on the smaller side.< /text>

Cute, and great for pictures. Really really windy in this area so keep in mind. The gift store is cute but gets a little crowded for my liking. I really enjoy how the dinosaurs vary in colors depending on the holidays! A must at least once with family or friends.</Review>

The Cabazon Dinosaurs

If you are on your way to Palm Springs then you’ve had to have driven by the Cabazon Dinosaurs. The question I’ve asked so many is, have you ever stopped? I am surprised at how many have not.
It’s worth 15 minutes to stop and stretch your legs, take a few silly pictures, laugh and get back on the road. Good pit stop area, there is a gas station and a Burger King on the same street.
The gift shop is just a bunch of dinosaur toys, beware if you don’t want to spend money on over priced toys.
Mr. Rex’s Adventure is $12 for adults and $10 for seniors/military and kids. Not sure that’s worth it unless you have kids, I did not go in for the full adventure experience.
There is plenty of free parking.< /Text>

As a fan of the movies Pee Wee’s Big Adventure and The Wizard it was good to see the Dinosaurs with my wife and kids.

The gift shop has good items that are a little pricey but it’s worth the purchase. I wish the Diner was still open but we were a few years too late.

This is a great family friendly place to visit!< /text>

The dinosaur displays are quite good and the natural setting is very impressive.   There were fun activities geared for the little ones in the family.   We visited on a Wednesday night and therefore didn't have the throngs of people that we saw here last weekend. Most impressive too was the "nights in colorful lights" -- as we stayed til after it got dark (outside trail).  Great fun for all ages.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This place is ONLY cool if you're just stopping by for pictures. The two largest and coolest dinosaurs to take photos with are free to access. The dinosaurs were painted for Valentine's Day and will be that way through March apparently. Cool photo op.

Didn't go inside the little park, too long of a line on Valentine's Day and you have to pay admission.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Went to get the dinosaur I've cream as a stop on the way home. No ice cream I'm not sure if they had hours posted about ice cream or not but we didn't know them. Just walked around and went into the store inside the dinosaur. It was a cool little rest stop. Just sad they didn't have the ice cream.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvnu-R6hKa8y6decUGWYXqkR5HByiUBFGu-K-D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfV44bdstLssv-Iu1S78RGdgtHFNZRXSfPTRbS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEHLMwGZaQNW825eKuTI4-175mRNMKIBs60sU_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We get to drive by to see these guys when we have our Palm Spings getaways. I think it's cute that they repaint them for holidays.

Fun place to take the kids who love Dinosaurs 🦕❤ about an hour and 40 min from LA county with beautiful landscape. Arrived in the afternoon and was super windy and cold but the actual park closes at 8pm. Parking is free,, Park entrance is $13 per adult children under 2 free. Only one food truck available. Del taco across the way, parking is next to long neck Dinosaur 😊</Text>

Such a fantastic stop! Wonderful walk through, cool digging area, great for kids to get out and stretch their legs. I would recommend a Saturday when there's food, but there's still fast food across the parking lot. You can climb to the top of Trex and roar out his mouth!!</text>

What a fun place to visit! This time of year especially, it's Christmas! They've got the whole places decked out for Christmas with lights and everything. What fun! Definitely a place to bring your dinosaur crazy kids. :) Merry Christmas!</Review>

<user_id>115604234608161915250</user_id><text>I have driven past these dinosaurs on the 10 Fwy numerous times and never stopped to see them. This weekend we had our granddaughters with us and decided to check them out. It was a suprising stop - I was not aware of how extensive the display was. The kids had a blast and I am happy we finally took the time to do this.< /text>< time>

<text>How cute! Yes, Tyrannosaurus Rex & a Brontosaurus both have been used in original Hollywood Movies are here.. free to see, walk around..take photos with, under, around.  Lots of free parking.

Adults: go ahead & be the child you are inside & sit resting on T-Rex's toes!

Climb Up into the brilliant pink Brontosaurus - visit their DINO-STORE jnside this p in nk giant,  and oh. Don't forget to bring the kids in with you!

Wander to the Left of gaudily painted T-REX  - HE's GREEN NOW.. & sports an enormous painted Easter Egg on his upper chest (no I don't know why) .. on his Left is an Adventure of Dinos..for the little ones, they'll let you in too.  Enjoy!!</text>< date>

Speaking from the perspectove of a 5 year old, the dinosaur experience is more than worth it for price of admission. The larger-than-life dinosaurs and interactive exhibits are thrilling! He simply did not want to leave.
And this year, T-Rex was suited up a Santa and ready for the Christmas holiday!</text>

Love this spot. The gift shop closes, but you can visit the T Rex and the brontosaurus/apatasaurus whenever - dinos are lit up nicely. Big plus is that they're now painted in different colors for the holidays!<//text>

It's a good spot for kids, but way too pricey for what you get. Time spent there is about an hour or less. Three adults and one child was $50.<//text>

I'm giving it 5 stars because our group of 8 didn't really go to experience the museum. Instead we went to just take pictures with the outside dinosaurs and for that, this served its purpose. At the gift shop, the employee noticed I was looking at gemstones and made some great suggestions about there being even more in the museum gift shop if anyone wanted to go.<//Text>

This review is by Connie's husband. I enjoyed myself that day. Weather was great, 20 minutes out, got to climb in side the dinasors, missed the Ice Cream truck, they only come on the weekends and holidays. Staff is very friendly, lots of info about dinosaurs. Picnic tables out side and at night everything lights up. 13 dollar tickets are worth the money.</Review>

What a great day trip from L.A. For $13 adult and $11 for kids you can visit the other dinosaurs that have been situated behind a wood fence as a walk-thru decorated for Valentine's. Gift shop and I believe restrooms are available. There are also restrooms next door at the Shell.</text>

Went out here on a little family date. Def a cool spot to bring you kids. They have quite a bit to look at at and your little ones to discover. They have a "fossil" pit for the kids to find with names of dinosaurs and they get a toy when they find one. Plenty of walking space to social distance. Each type of dino has some info on them when is cool especially for the older kids. Gift store is small but they have plenty of toys and stuff to leave with. Theg also have a large t rex you can walk inside of and have a look out of its mouth. Didnt get to go up as there was a line for it. All n all good time fun experience</text>

Great for young kiddos. My 4yr old grandson loved it and was so excited. Although i don't believe climbing the inside of the rex to the top is for young ones too steep of steps had to carry my grandson which was dangerous  we both could of fell<//review>

<response>None<//response><Text>So cute for kids to take picture with all the Dinosaurs. Climb inside the big pink one and see the gift shop with all the toys.
Then go into the back behind t rex. Interactive Dinosaurs and a walking path full of Dinosaurs. Rocks to find for free gifts, pan for stones, and climb up inside of T rex and look out his mouth..</Text>< Gmap_id>

I little bit pricey for what you get.  I would give it 5 stars if they charged a little bit less. Perhaps $8 for adults and $6 for kids.  If you have a family of four, you are looking at $48.00.  This doesn't include anything, just admission.< /review>< pics>

For 13 dollars it's a fine place to be able to climb into the giant TRex. Didn't see all the creationist propaganda everyone keeps reporting, so it wasn't in your face if it's there. Place wasn't busy, and def is a tourist trap, but we knew it was when we went<//Text>

<Text>Kids 18mos to 4yo will probably enjoy this. This is a very small place with many dinosaurs made from a cement. Some make sounds and some can move. What fun is the shop that shapes like a dino. There are some benches with table but not enough shade to rest. It will be hot when its sunny.< /Text><user>118091548440967121764< /user></record></dataset><record>

A little crowded and needs a separate entrance and exit for people attending but still solid fun. Its $13 for adults to enter the exhibit and $10 for a family photo with Santa. They take the photo on a cell phone and you give them your cell number and they text it to you. If you going to just a take a picture in front of the Santa 🎅  🦖 its still a fun photo opportunity before going shopping at the Cabazon outlets. Go on a weekend to get a ice cream from the food truck. Very yummy.<//Review>

<user_name>lorena caviness< /user_name><Review>Super cool for something almost free and that you can't see just anywhere. You can actually go inside 2 of the giant dinosaurs! And pay the fee to walk through the park, its fun for something different for the kids. Mine are 9 and 15 and we all enjoyed it!<//Review></record>

<Text>Stopped by on our way home kids loved it. Giving it a 4 star because I wish it was a little bit bigger, and I wish the admission for kids was a little less. Overall a fun place if you're driving by and want to walk around and stretch.

This place was more fun than I thought it would be. We were entertained for an hour or two. It might be a bit pricy to enter for the amount of time you can spend here but we were happy we stopped. Especially good place for kids.</Review>

If your kid is into dinosaurs, they will like this place. It's hard to get pics tho when there's alot of foot traffic, as the walkways are narrow. Lines are long to get inside the iconic t Rex, bathrooms, ice cream truck, and picture taking areas. Still, it's a neat place to visit and family friendly!< /review>

If you ever saw Pee Wee's Big Adventure in the 80's. You may remember when Pee Wee visits the dinosaur statues. It reminds me of that time as a kid. I couldn't believe how many people were out there taking photo's. Great place to stop walk around and get a bite to eat before traveling on the Palm Springs.</review>

Nice little pit stop as there is nothing for a while. Easy to park, and there’s a shop inside. There’s also a walking park with $13 admission. Didn’t see that we were short in time. Fun for some quick photos.< /text>

It's predictably cheesy, but cute. My 4 year old son had an absolute blast. The step ladder and cans of spray paint by the raptors did ruin some of the magic though.
It's the kind of place that you go to once and then never again. You can walk through it all in about 25 minutes without hurrying at all. At the price of about $50 for 2 adults and 2 kids it's a little pricey.<//text>

We had a GREAT time with the Grand kids, it was nice to get out of the house on such a beautiful day. The Christmas lights were a very nice bonus, we will definitely be back.</review>

< Review>
I was so lucky that I got to go up inside the Tyrannosaurus rex mouth! This is one of California’s most recognizable roadside attractions. It was featured in a number of movies including peewee Herman‘s great adventure. Inside the park is a number of dinosaur displays. It’s definitely worth paying the admission to go inside. It’s a great photo op an a lot of fun. If you wanna see a cool video I made on the dinosaurs look me up on YouTube Bartell’s Backroads</Review>

<text>They painted one pink and added some rather expensive side attraction. At least you can stuff look at them and take pictures for free, and the shop inside one is still open. It's a fun quick place to  stretch your legs and take pictures.</text>< Response>

It’s a nice place to stop if you’re passing through. Short quick visit and the dinosaurs are really huge.< /text>

It was alright, though we were expecting a little more. It's basically just dinosaurs, 2 or 3 activities to do, the gift shop and the ice cream truck outside.<//Text>

This classic roadside attraction made famous by Pee Wee's Big Adventure has recently begun painting the T-rex and Brontosaurus according to the current holiday season!  In December, Rex was dressed Santa attire and is currently sporting a white jacket tux to celebrate Valentine's Day while Bronte is a bright pink looking like a Sweetheart. This is a must see event/photo op and when you go don't forget to tell 'em Large Marge sent ya!</Text>

Awesome place to stop with the kids... Maybe even without kids. Fun to see if in area or need a quick stop along highway. There is a dino area for the kids but it will cost money. It is worth it if you want a cheap 30 to 60 minute stop< /review>

We too my son to see the dinosaurs dressed in their Valentine's day attire.  Very cute how the pair them, the T rec in a black tux and the brontosaurus in pink.  My son was too scared to walk by them.  They do allow you to take pictures outside.  We didn't go inside this time.   Maybe when he is a little older...< /review>

<Review>Nice Place to come and take pics. With the family or solo. Small gift shop inside Dinny the Larger one. , you can walk Inside both.  They have a nice walk thru Dino and excavation are for families. Items are a lil pricey for me but aimed at tourists. For a local to stop n buy a few items cN spend 50 $ or more. Many come thru so you should also. Fun Experience.</Review><date>1611664735028<//date></record>

<Text>Love the massive Dino’s, fun for all ages, have hand sanitizer on-site. Feels like Jurassic park. Except the dinosaurs are stationary, but still life sized. Inside the Dino was super hot. They have bathrooms on site and tons of parking. There is also a gift shop with snacks, toys, and other random things to buy. Very campy, very fun. A roadside must see.</Text>< pics>

Went there around August 12. If you don't mind the heat then it's ok. But I really love the Brontosaurus and Rex by the entrance there. I believe you have to pay $12 adults to get in. It looks like a cute dinosaur jungle with some roaring but it was hot at the time so I'll save to come by in the winter.  If you enter from the Brontosaurus tail, there's a nice little gift shop in its tummy.</Text>

Really nice play to let kids explore and see all the types of dinosaurs. There's also a store to buy plenty of dinosaur toys and merchandise. Overall I liked it<//text>

If you grew up in the 80's, then you won't need to be reminded that these fantastic dinosaurs were featured in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. This place is great!! They have a walking path with dinosaurs, you can climb up into the T-Rex's mouth, and until Easter you can get pictures taken. This is a must stop rest stop on any road trip!!<//Review>

I've driven by the Cabazon dinosaurs at least a 1000 times, yet never stopped to see them up close.  Great for a pit stop. The dinosaurs have been spruced up with new coats of paint. Cool selfie spot. The pink dinosaur has a neat gift shop inside for kids. Definitely worth seeing. It's right by Hadley's. Stop in there too for a date/banana shake and scrumptious beef jerkey!< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>If you've ever seen Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985) the T-rex (Mr.  Rex) will look familiar. Although it is currently wearing a Tuxedo! The life-size Brontosaurus (Dinny) is currently painted pink! It was crowded with people taking pictures when we went on Valentines day, but usually it's not too crowded. I recommend visiting the souvenir shop INSIDE the dinosaur! Parking is easy to find and close to the dinosaurs.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqROrhsa6yWnks5YNa0IsAqloyMKqkDa00akp8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

I love how no according to the holiday the Dinosaurs change their look. It has become our family tradition to stop and replicate an old photo from our prior visits.</Review>

Fun place and kind of wacky! One of the dinosaurs was painted like a rabbit for Easter. Good stop off point on the way back from Palm Springs 🌴 .< /Review>

<Review>My rating is based on how long it takes to get there from Northern Orange County. They need more signs with facts for the different dinosaurs that they have. More working hand sanitizer’s. Employees to enforce mask wearing, and distancing. Perhaps lower the ticket price a bit. My child enjoyed her self. Mind you a mouth her like $40 toys.<//Review>< time>

< Review>
Our daughter had loads of fun for the 15 minutes we were here. Took a couple cute photos and had some fun but it got late and she lost it so we had to leave earlier than anticipated. She is VERY into dinosaurs right now and she was pointing out any that were hiding in the bushes etc. If it wasn't 2 hours away we would go back for sure. Maybe another day.</Review>

<Text>Always a fun stop.  Easy freeway access.  There is a gift shop and a portion you have to pay to walk through. We have never paid, but have gone to the gift shop before.  They are painted for valentines day right now.   Super cute.</Text><Rate>5</Rate>< Resp>

Cute little place to stretch your legs for a bit. You can visit the store inside the long neck in the front or take pics with that one or the Trex without going inside the gates.< /Review>

Could not resist the urge to come here to see the dinosaurs decorated for Christmas. It was just my husband and I. Our kids are grown but this trip did not disappoint. We've driven by this place so many times. Glad we finally took the time to go inside and see it all.< /text>

One of the few things open during these weird covid times but was still fun for little 3yr old. Not too busy when i went good way to kill 2hrs. Maybe not as fun for older kids since place is not so big and not a whole lot of things to do.<//Text>

A little bit of a tourist trap, dinosaur exhibit costs $13 for adults $11 children. There are a lot of dinosaurs for photo opportunities. But it is definitely for the kids.<//Review>

My daughter loved it. Its a nice walk especially with the sprinklers system they got for the hot weather. They have a gift shop inside a Brachiosaurus  which is awesome. You can up inside a trex and take good pictures. Love the animatronics dinos.the raptors are very sweet to take that jurrasic world pic. Overall a good place to take your family especially if they love dinosaurs.< /text>

It's not a museum, it's not an attraction park, it's more of a pit stop/ landmark that your kid(s) may enjoy. Cool souvenirs, however you might want to get there early to avoid the crowd.< /review>

<Review>Had an amazing time there with my daughter and my grandkids. My grandkids loved the little adventure thru the dinosaur path and the rock search for a prize. There's two dinosaurs 🦖🦕 that you you can go inside of 🤗< /Review>< pictures>

<Name>Brenndon McGill</Name><rating>5<//rating><text>Awesome place to check out.  There is a little exhibit you can also check out where you can sift through sand/rocks and find shark teeth and whatnot.  Also there are dinosaurs and velociraptors in there.  Out front, there is a gift shop inside of the Brontosaurus (one with long neck).  There is also an ice cream truck out front that's a little pricey but the ice cream is good.</text><Gmap_id>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134<//Gmap_id><user>115528361351702243504</user><Date>1610374367782</Date>< pics>

<text>There's a lot more to this place than there was when it was just two dinosaurs off of a truck stop years ago, and the employees here I have the best attitude I have ever experienced. Every single employee was as polite as a person could be, from paying to get in or asking about a gift or just them walking past you, absolutely amazing people, which is even more impressive when they're working and 115 degree weather with unappreciative crowds.
The ice cream truck is also a cool experience.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBc32ebsj0-lqpqRZEEzyiAU-CyRfb1dcuxKr6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5Oj56D2b2nGiYJsVDXcHbwe1f5CDJ-IAhggs5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEne2AU8am800TI7t73pQ83EbhL-q2dSUZSSDH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOp2EMW0ABHmbL5bPRhLY_WafOM-3XHIjt5bYWt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

If you want to go and live far, take everything into consideration and leave super early. Grandma was visiting and I wanted to try and take her and the kiddo to see the first night of Christmas lights before her flight. We had to wait for remote schooling. It said 2 hour drive from San Diego. Turned into 3 because of a random accident. And then we got stuck behind a none moving train for 15 min. We don't live there, so didn't realize there was another route. I tried asking the GPS but it wasn't showing an alternate route. Maybe my fault for trying to beat the clock! But then we found another route and got stuck in a highway split and literally missed the exit because it wouldn't let us out! The last tickets for Christmas lights are at 7:30. We were supposed to be there at 7 and then 7:20 so on and so on. We tried to run up to the gate to see if they would still let us in just for a picture. They said no. We were able to get a picture outside, which was better than nothing I guess. But not sure if I want to make that drive back when I heard its such a small park. Maybe I will on a day we have more time, but kinda sucks the 6 hour round trip drive was for nothing. We did however have a great time as a family in the car, so I guess in the end its what you make of it! Taught my son that every moment has a silver lining and that family time is awesome even without seeing spectacular lights and dinosaurs.< /review>

I haven't been here in a few years and took my kids today, it was so fun! Their was a food truck with dinosaur shaped treats, parking was easy and free, and the dinosaurs are painted in their valentine's best! There's a gated walking path that has lights and tons of smaller (still giant) dinos to read about and enjoy, and a store to buy lots of dinosaurs treasures. Inside the shop you can pay $2 for a kiddo dino ride. I loved that there was sanitizer every 10 feet too.< /Text>

You  can’t miss the Dinny the Dinosaur or Large Marge attraction in Cabazon. Seriously… you can’t miss it! Standing 65 feet tall, these massive concrete dinosaurs are a sight to behold! When you spot the T-Rex prepare for some gargantuan fun at a great value! Cabazon Dinosaurs rolls out the inner child in visitors year-round 7 days a week. Get up close and personal with photo ops galore. Make sure to have your friends  and family in tow as you walk around and admire the handiwork and vision of a man that sought to bring his childhood dream to life in his 80’s.  Thank you, Mr. Claude Bell.
Besides Dinosaurs there are several activity station kids will enjoy. Two awesome gift shops, one of which you’ll see and hear infinite realistic dinosaurs in every direction, — If you or your children dig dinosaurs- This is a must DO!< /Text>

Been driving by these all my life. Moved to northern california a while back so I hadn't brought my kids by yet. Finally got to. They're older but still enjoyed stopping to look at them and take pictures.< /Text>

I have always wanted to go here since I was a kid. Now having kids of my own afforded me the chance to go and do something with them.  I guess it was good that I wasn't expecting a lot, but they do have a whole walk through that you can learn about different dinosaurs and at the end you can actually walk up into the T-Rex and look out through the teeth. They have a couple of cool activities for the kids, like dig through sand, find a rock and if it has a name on it you get a prize of the gift shop, or learn how to panhandle sand and rocks to find gems. The prices are not outrageous, and it helps support local community projects such as this. If you're on the 10 headed to Palm springs or the rest of the United States take a chance stop by you might be pleasantly surprised.</Review>

It as fun for the kids, not factoring in 108° weather. Small place, definitely a 1 time experience. The upkeep inside could of been a little more lively. I would say the kids pricing should out weigh the adult admission.< /Text>

I love this place. A true gem for the dinosaur seekers out there. My kids love coming and let their imaginations run wild. The evening lights are a plus when on displays.</review>

A nice little getaway just to spend so fun time with the family making memories together. Definitely worth the trip if you have little ones. Would recommend going when the waffle truck is there. It is really good.< /text>

Stopoed there a week ago but we where only able to see the 2 Dinosaurs outside it was closed beacuse of COVID-19, but it looked fun, if you have kids take them there they will enjoy and will not be bored, something to do on a weekend.</text>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>Fun for the whole family. Our little boy loves dinosaurs. So, it was an automatic hit. Also this is an all American roadside attraction. Paying to go in is a little pricy. Don't walk to fast or you'll zoom through the little trails. Cute gift shop but expensive. Still happy to support a California landmark.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

It's kinda fun to stop by for free pictures with the huge dinosaurs if you happen to be in the area. We didn't pay for the whole experience though. The giftshop was interesting in that you walk up into the dino for it, and although we didn't get to see any waffle trucks, the dinosaur-shaped ones they advertise on many billboards looked really cute.</text>

<Text>Finally, after living in California for 50+ years, we stopped by the dinosaurs!
It was too cold outside to stop for long, but you can see these two free of charge.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134<//Gmap_id><date>1609194682348<//date>< Name>

<review>This nostalgic place has been a constant for nearly my entire life, and it was still open despite most tourist attraction places being closed. Everyone was social distancing and wearing their masks and it was so nice to be able to stop for a pic with my son and keep at least one family tradition alive during these difficult times. The gentleman handling the attraction was in such good spirits, also! This was actually my favorite stop there ever! Thanks guys!< /review>< user_id>

<Text>What a surprise! 100 foot tall TREX im not going to spoil it for you! Its clear from the freeway. One thing of note its a very tight parking Rea that doesn't allow for Rv sized vehicles. There is a gas station and other areas to park. Got kids or just a Redneck like myself.ITS A MUST SEE!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGsHehnr6zvFodJ9O-9VzmZU279BOW7tcTM0zo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLqokDuKCZkre9AVFp0_FeSAqZ_V0_xpVtJTMH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

Could use a bit more.  I was excited for the ice cream truck.  Unfortunately we went when it was not there.  The whole experience took us about 15 minutes.  Wish there was more.  Gift shop items are a bit overpriced if you asked me.<//Text>

This is a must-go place when you’re in Palm Spring. This dinosaur is voted the largest dinosaur sculpture in the world (can you believe it!?). They have 2 big dinosaurs in the park, including a big green T-rex and a long neck brown dinosaur. This place is in the desserts so the weather is hot and dry year round.</Text>

<Text>Nice little pit stop for the family. Even during these times(COVID-19). You have open space to walk around and not feel close to anyone.  It was good to see that everyone around us used there masks. Just like us.< /Text>< Rating>

Good good, Not a bad price for $13 adults and $7 children. but there is no need to go specifically from far away, it is not so grandiose as in the photos, drive along your way! for sure. good luck. Be blessed!< /text>

I have wanted to see these dinosaurs since I was 4 years old and I saw Pee-wee's Big Adventure. They do not disappoint. They are amazing. If you drive past these and don't stop to see them, you are out of your mind.< /Review>

Great place to visit if you are nearby. Gift shop is way over priced and sadly it advertises mechanical dinosaurs but there is only about 4 working the rest are not working at all. Place needs lots of maintenance.</review>

Some are dismayed at Bronto's color scheme & T-Rex's T-Shirt. I say nobody knows what colors they were & these could conceivably be as accurate as anyone else's guess.<//review>

That it was a neat place to take your kids if there 5 or above and understand about dinosaurs, there were alot of people so it was a bit crowded. $13. For adults and $11. Per kid Seems a bit much for just walking around. Landscape could definitely use a little cleaning up so you can see the dinosaurs better. But overall it was and could be a place I'd go again.</review>

T-Rex was painted wearing a Santa Claus outfit. Area was clean and many people stopped to take some pics with family. Burger King is near so you can stop for food if you want to eat as well.< /Text>

Fun family location. Small location, but if you like dinosaurs you can spend a good amount of time here. Plus you can get your hand stamped for re entry. Gift shops were cute and well maintained even during busy times. Employees were friendly and helpful.
Restroom was clean and well stocked.  Lots of hand sanitizers set up throughout park for covid times.
Parking was busy when we went,  but still didn't have to wait that long to get a spot. Santa Claws photo op is a great add on experience to remember your trip.
Overall great experience.</Text>

Super cute little stop on the side of the road. Plenty of parking, very sweet staff, and tons of dinosaur related merchandise. Dogs that can be easily carried are allowed inside the exhibit itself or service animals are fine too. Other dogs are allowed outside in the parking lot and around the brontosaurus gift shop and the giant T-Rex outside. We brought our own water foe the dogs and glad we dis as we did not see any wayer fountain and the only bathroom is located inside the exhibit. Glad we stopped here and forced our teens to take pictures with dino's. :)</review>

< Review>
A fun pitstop in the classic roadside attraction tradition. The kids mostly enjoyed themselves and the attraction is pretty well put together, but it definitely feels a little dated and banking on that trip through the gift shop.</Review>

WHAT A GREAT SMALL ROADSIDE ATTRACTION! Pull into the lot and you can get a couple of good pictures from the lot. The BRONTOSAURUS  is a gift shop! However if you wanna get a view from the T-REX mouth, you gotta purchase admission tickets. Throughout your walk you’ll get to see many many types of dinosaurs and facts! You’ll even get a chance to sift for gem stones and they provide you with a little baggie to keep your findings! You’ll even have the opportunity to do some Dino rock digging! Find a rock with a dinosaur name and claim your prize at the gift shop! The walk was scattered with water misters keeping you nice and cool. Lots of photo opportunities throughout as well. Ever heard of a WAFFLESAURUS? Certain days throughout the week the wafflesaurus truck is there to serve yummy ice cream treats with a dinosaur shaped waffle! Great for little ones or anyone needing to get some good photos. Went without any little ones and still had a blast!!< /Text>

<Text>Look at how big this Dino is! This is the perfect pit stop to stretch your legs with children or family. You don’t have to pay to go in! You can park in the lot and then walk around the two dinosaurs without paying any kind of fee. They aren’t behind any kind of gate and they’re the main attraction.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxd4MbGj7s3SvFxruBDbgMTNRbbwSa1Gq--_s6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<review>Perfect place for my little dinosaur lover!! It's a little small but great and just enough for my little toddler. We did spend more time at the gift shops looking at all things dinosaur. It's about $13 per person and we were there for about an hour. Took a lot of pictures and played in there little areas such as digging for rocks,  mining gems, climb up the big t-rex (we didn't go due to covid concerns), and trading in our rock finds for a small prize.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

<Text>It was my 1st time here my gf loves Dinasours and she loved it ❤ it was an amazing experience we are both in our late 20's but we felt like kids again and they have a lot of cool Dinasour stuff in their shop totally gave me Jurassic Park vibes.

So here’s the thing: what do you expect from dinosaurs off the freeway? If nothing than you’ll be pleasantly surprised. There’s a store in the belly of Large Marge (the long neck). There’s also a dinosaur garden you can pay to walk through and access the inside of the t-Rex and look out of the mouth. Our four year old was ALL about it and I enjoyed it too. Even if nothing is open, it’s a great stop for photos.< /Text>

Driving into and out of California, then you gotta come here. Sure you can see Dino’s in a lot of places but these are some of the best. Plus it’s a great place to stop and rest your legs from the long drive.</text>

Nephew loved it. They offer military discount. It shows they put effort into their dinosaurs. I waited about 45 mins to go into the T-Rex head. IMO you can pass on that line. Pictures with Santa had COVID precautions. Photographer used an iPhone to airdrop photos to customers.<//Text>

My nephew and my two nieces came last week and told me to come and see the dinosaurs, the  green one and the one with the Santa outfit are open to the public but if you want to go inside and see more you have to pay $13 dls. Worth it if you have kids and like dinosaurs.< /Review>

Super fun for my son (who happens to be a huge dinosaur aficionado).... great gift shop, and good place to stop and stretch the legs. Or to visit if your staying at Morongo with the kids.</review>

This is a great place to stop the kids love it here. the souvenirs are a bit on the higher priced side but they are cute and completely worth it! conveniently located next to a Burger King and a gas station! they also have a little area in the back the kids can go through I think it's like 13-15$ for adults and 11$ for the kids. I can't quote that pricing I am basing it off of memory.< /Text>

It’s a little over priced for the amount of dinosaurs they have but it’s still a cool place to check out if your in the area.</Text>

Plenty of people will be taking their selfies with the awesome tyrannosaur rex or stegosaurus. Enjoy it if you have the opportunity when your heading to Riverside from Palm Springs.</Review>< Rating>

Great fun! These dinosaurs are huge! Didn't make it to the museum, but will next time. Freshly painted these make for a great family photo.</review>

<Text>It takes all of 15 minutes to see....the gift shop is ok. The cool part about the gift shop is going inside a dinosaur! The ice cream truck is okay. They might attract more people to buy ice cream if it was $5 rather then almost $8 and the dino dig? $11 to get in is crazy. All in all it's a good place to stop for 5-10 min stretch your legs and take a picture or 2 and be on the way....this might be a better attraction if they did more with it!< /Text>< Name>

If u just want a pic with the giant dinosaurs you can just take it from the outside of the park. If u want to explore the "museum"  you can too.  Ita a bit pricey for what it is, but fun nonetheless.<//review>< resp>

<review>Love taking the family there. Been going there since the 80s back in the day when you could walk to the T-Rex back side and slide down. That place has changed a lot. Open close open but love when it's open. Next we need to check out there dinosaurs museum in the back the next time we have time to go.</review>< pictures>

<text>What a cool, kitschy place! The wintery weather and storm clouds made it even better. This place isn't posh by any means, but it exceeded my expectations. When you pay to go into the main part, you go behind  fencing and a whole new world opens up. Estimating another 30-40 dinosaurs of various sizes in this area. You can tell they're working on the exhibits. There's a nice path to meander through, either gravel or pavement. We had so much fun running back and forth. Great for little ones under five.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHbk6wK4wmLtZwHAETngUauqs5lk1aDPGCR1XE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOf40wlmKhWlqPboiDDieTuGDjiJc0BcehWSKRu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtajWwJ8dtv5GoBUakCVDAzjyAtWRjEbHBl3d2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnyVRzAtR6N-ixBLrf9O_PFClHeh023qAYVzW_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAprjveTJcwS7WWz642g7UC98GTAJaqQq8JrLA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNEBNJFRe-l_unofLh1sczOcsyWTCZcCWBCgGZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

Such a cool place and very easy to access. Stopped here to stretch our legs on our long trip home. My girls were able to run around and I got some great pictures. Gift shop is a little pricey but I kind of expected that. We got some neat souvenirs. Definitely a fun sight to see. Wish we would have had more time to check out the play area that was towards the back  but we didn't have the time to justify the cost. We will definitely check it out next time we are out that way!<//review>

It was a road side dino attraction. You look at statues of dinosaurs. All the animatronic dinosaurs were inside the gift shop. It's good if you you have kids 7 and under. The park did not seem to limit the amount of people they were letting in even during a pandemic It was very crowded when we were there. So just be aware.</text>

< Review>
This is one of those road side attractions that has been around forever. I enjoyed stopping here as a kid, and now enjoy taking my kids here. Anybody who is a fan of Pee Wee's Big Adventure will recognize this place from the scene that they did here. Inside the dinosaur is a gift shop with all sorts of toys and gag gifts. Lot's of cheap stuff you can buy for the kids to entertain them when you get back on the 10 freeway. There's also some food and gas nearby so you can plan a pit stop here.< /Review>

< Review>
This place is tiny but fun in its cheesiness. Great price, veteran & dog friendly! 🇺🇸 🐶 When you first walk in, you have to watch a minute of video in the gift shop. Then you can go wander through the Dino enclosure. It's best to look at the exhibits in broad swaths than to get caught up in the minor details & imperfections. This place is wonderfully nostalgic & not quite professional but way better than amateurish. The staff is great! It's a piece of roadside Americana harkening back to another time. Make sure you get to go up Rex and into his Jaws! Before sunset is a good time. May need a sweater depending on the time of year. It's usually windy. Can rush through the whole place in less than an hour, but I suggest at least two for fun photos.</Review>

< Review>
It is $10 to get in, which is why it's 2 stars. If it was $5 to get in then it would be 4 stars no questions asked.

This place was built in the 70's, it's a creationist museum. The dinosaurs are not as authentic looking or realistic as it should be, given its 2016. The information hanging around various sights inside the museum are partially accurate or fixed on creationism view point. There's lots of dinosaurs with a fixed trail. You are not allowed to walk into the forest dinosaur terrain because there might be wild life, such as snakes. There are some sheds in the dinosaur terrain which you are not allowed to go into to. Not as cool as it looks, most of the dinosaurs look deformed or scary with unwelcoming eyes our big head shapes. Some are missing limbs.

Inside there is a robotic dinosaur your can ride for $2 and you must be 80 pounds or lighter. There's a bunch of toys and goods for sale, everything you can buy on Amazon probably.

The robotics are the technology from the 80's and it's more on the creepy side then the cool side.

If you are on a long road trip, this would be a good spot for you. If you're on budget I don't suggest going inside but staying outside and take a few pictures.< /Review>

<Review>Great for children who love dinosaurs. Personally I think it's a little pricey for what it is. There are some animatronics dinosaurs in the gift shop. Wish some of the outdoor dinosaurs were also in the maternal. And they had more actual dinosaur facts posted.
Plenty of space to park does have a nice clean restroom. There's also a gift shop.</Review>< Time>

Love these giant well painted dinos right next door to casino morongo on the way to Palm springs, Salton Sea and Glamis. Great for the kids with current food trucks in the parking lot to serve up some grub during these troubling covid-19 times in 2021 stay safe people.</text>

I came here all the time in my childhood. It's nice with the remodels, more kid friendly and great photo ops. Nostalgia!</Review>

<text>These 🦕 have been roaming around Cabazon for millions of years. It's a great place to take the kids because they have a small area with other displays (for a nominal fee) truly worth it. Don't be afraid to to stop by unless you're chicken 😳<//text>< userid>

<Text>The place is great for a quick photo op but aside from the little shop, it's pretty much a fun tourist trap. Nonetheless, the place is great to visit on your way to Coachella. Bring your kids, I'm sure they'll love it here. The place could use more shade and tables though.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkf_eyb9kePbZPbfeGGv8bNlxUSOUpGRIsQp7a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONKrbV4JN6Q9n10sQj0r6sDnxNhzf4gzl7P6ye=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAm1BuqgPoVYqlTTvPEdEO3TOfsuiJ5Utu7jtB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmQ9bjuBNixJbVILM8yrpfqnUoEqI8ubbYTQCC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOarK5bp-I4i34p2G36hFaKhFtaGsJg0L_8_SCx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< date>

<text>This place, while seemingly cool to kids at first glance, is actually atrocious and ridiculous. It's a creationist museum that claims that scientists are lying and that the "fossils tell us that dinosaurs walked with man 6000 years ago." DON'T take your kids here if you're hoping to show them something educational and intelligent. DO go here with a bunch of friends while drunk.<//text>< Response>

Been coming here with my 3 daughters since they were toddlers...now they are in their 30's!!! Lots of great memories over the years. They are always inventing ways to keep this a fun and interesting destination for families. Still the most memorable experience is climbing the stairwell inside the T Rex to reach the mouth and monstrous teeth like Pee Wee Herman did in his big adventure. My kids still love it. Thanks for the memories.</Text>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>The dinos are cool and they have signs for masks and social distancing, but posted next to those signs is an essay about how they basically don't believe it and only post signs so Governor Newsom doesn't shut them down. They make sure to mention his name a few time. It's pretty juvenile. And reckless to endanger their guests. May be back for a photo op eventually...but probably won't support them...<//Review>< pics>

Great place for a quick fun picture. Best part the park is free.
This park is a mainstay of the area's history.
I read in their museum the dinosaurs were built and designed from a gentleman that worked on Knotts Berry Farm.
Great memories here.
Mexican restaurant across the street is good and reasonable.<//Text>

<review>Cute little stop off the 10 to get out of the car and stretch. If you feel like spending some cash the little Dino museum has cute animatronics and there's a couple hands on activities for the kids to enjoy. Didn't get a chance to enjoy the weekend waffle truck but it sure did look yummy.</review>< Name>

Despite repeated childhood viewings of "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" & fishing trips to the Salton Sea, it took the love of money (by way of adjacent Morongo Casino) to finally lead me to Riverside County's most famous roadside attraction.

Boasting over 50 static & robotic dinosaurs, the quaint Cabazon Dinosaurs theme park is great for young kids.  The giant T-Rex & Brontosaurus (now Apatosaurus) are free attractions for the public to enjoy.  Those with paid admission can find a few other activities to enjoy.

The Dino Dig provides a taste of excavation.  Budding paleontologists can scour the sand, in search of a rock with a dinosaur name printed on it.  The lucky ones that find said rock, can redeem it for a prize at the gift shop.

Fossil & gemstone panning recreates what it's like to pan for fossils & rare earth minerals, which attracted the California Gold Rush 49ers to relocate & venture over the Sierra Nevadas.  Bags of actual fossils & gemstones can be purchased at the gift shop.

Visitors can take the stairs inside the T-Rex to it's mouth.  Signs say to limit time in the T-Rex's mouth to 2 minutes, however, leaving kids & families to the honor system is a folly in & of itself.  After waiting several minutes inside the stuffy & crowded T-Rex belly, I was fed up with the disease trap & left.

During the weekend, the Wafflesaurus Truck comes by 1:30pm - 7:30pm, right outside the entrance.

I can finally check off the Cabazon Dinosaurs off my must-see list!  Little kiddos will love it!  Tweeners on up, not so much.  The roadside attraction is a good respite during a long road trip, but on it's own, it's not worth the gas.< /Text>

Fun little exhibit for any dinosaur lover to admire. Good for something to do on an afternoon with kids. The place is a little run down but still pretty cool to see the different dinos outside and some inside the gift shop that move.</text>

Very well kept up- clean, fun. Totally worth the stop on our way home. Even the grown ups had fun. Great photo ops as well. My only gripe is if someone needs to stay in the car with a pet or what have you there isn't really much shade.<//Review>

Pull over here if you like dinosaurs or like novelty stops! Not a ton of other things to do... But this is a great stop on the way somewhere. Burger King & gas station nearby if stopping for lunch or refuel.</Review>

Awesome place to stop for a little bit. Great history! 250,000 and 12 years to built the first dinosaur.< /review>

Under 3 free.
But it was a nice quick stop along the way to our destination.  Some cool dinosaurs ro take pictures of but lots of the same types also< /text>< response>

<Review>Certainly an iconic location used in many movies and visited by millions over the years. The pricing was perceived as too high for me so I reduced a star, otherwise I would highly recommend stopping if only to get pictures from the parking lot.</Review><user>113320775391418788357<//user>< Pictures>

< Review>
I'm a truck driver and had some time to kill before delivering in LA so decided to stop and check out the place.  I really wasn't expecting much since I'm an adult that went alone.  It was a nice little place but some of the dinosaurs were showing their age.  There were a few families there with young kids that appeared to be really excited by all the dinosaurs.<//Review>

My daughter and I had a lot of fun here. The price was reasonable. The attractions: Dino Dig, Mining for stones, the various dinosaurs around the place (moving and stationary), and the grand finale sitting in T-Rex mouth.

Overall an enjoyable experience for a decent price.< /review>

It's charming in a tacky kind of way. I wouldn't go back, but it's a cool place to visit at least once.<//Text>

<Text>Excellent for kids. I remember seeing this on an old vhs video as a kid and wanting to visit. I didn't know it was actually real until last year so I put it on my bucket list. I'm sure it was weird seeing a 30 year old man geeking out over dinosaurs, but it was absolutely worth it.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Great place to take the family! We went for the first time tonight for pictures with santa and as locals having the dinos in our family Christmas photo just makes sense. The park is clean and you can even go up to the trexs mouth. The gift shop is a bit pricey but they have lots of cute dino stuff. The man running the place even went out of his way to notice my two daughters and make their experience special as well.<//Review>< user_name>

It's definitely a roadside attraction, but there was just enough to do to entertain my 18 month old for an hour and a half and give her a non scary first introduction to dinosaurs. So for us, it was perfect! She loved the panning station, the dino dig and just wandering the paths to look at all the dinosaurs.< /Review>

Now, we get to enjoy the Wafflesaurus Ice Cream Truck, as well!  An angel food-like waffle dinosaur eating the scoops of your favorite ice cream!  Even with the safety measures in place, the staff was friendly and so helpful!  Shoot out to Dino Ranger Ezekiel for taking our family pic in this heat!  So Cheerful and hard working. A great representative of this attraction.   Thanks, Ezekiel!<//Text>< gmapID>

<Review>I strongly urge anyone with a family that is passing by these dinos to stop and check them out! You can climb into one of the dinosaurs to find a fun, little gift shop. My son always LOVED going in there when he was little! There's also an area that you can pay to tour. I can't speak on that portion, as I've never when into that area. Overall, this is a fun area to stretch your legs and give kids a little Dino lesson!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN36OYZcSW5LYGeZEb9KE3aAsGSqjMAhDpzXclz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOEk38MxAcMVBaXoSHRBQAusorqmK60hCagbZo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

Stand next to T-Rex and sit on his claws, or stand under the Brontosaurus and touch his belly.  Both Dinosaurs are also gift shops which hold treasures for you to buy and keep forever.  Right off the 10 fwy on your way through the Cabazon Desert, next to Casino Morongo.  It's a timeless place that has stood the test of time.  Get lost in this hidden gem and remember these guys forever.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLQFc5eTUE0oheM6RH6AQ5quKE0WjoWe1SE5R2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPavInmXY1ifVN52RpVcHGUpw6b3uM-qSzX8zuu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmGRl-oc8S5uFngYbPE7sVWm3Newdrzvc_glvm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5o_PlkA4TUSpSIdyixhvBEQ8C1SGOA4QqiRM3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKiPjaZ3ZMQD5N8vOyHFGacVRNOaSPWoMarK9-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIeWKpiK_O7WhVGML0kNlZshhTrF64wRZCIkNp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134< /gmapID></record>

< Review>
Fun 1 hour stop, it is a little pricy though at $13 for adults, kids 3-12 are $11, they do offer a military discount at $10 for the member only. It is hot in the summer so bring water and maybe a portable fan to help stay cool. They do have misters along the paths. Definitely recommend a visit!<//Review>

Fun place to stop with children on a roadtrip maybe? Wouldn't go out of our way to come here again in truthfulness. It's 10 dollars a person and we discovered afterwords that it was purchased in the mid 90s by a group pushing creationism mythology to families. Though the propaganda motif isn't spread widely around the whole park, you start to get a glimpse of the narrative as soon as you enter the gift shop. All inherent oddness aside, it's kind of neat to see the models against the Mojave backdrop. If you believe in your heart that the earth was created 2000 years ago along with primitive man.. this is the place for you!</text>

Date of Visit: Thursday Dec 12th, 2019

If you are ever in the area of Palm Springs, California you will want to stop at the Cabazon Dinosaurs just off the highway.
You cant miss these giants as they are towering figures right off the highway.

You can stop for photos with the 2 main ones that you see, but there is also a dinosaur park just beyond. The cost to enter the park is about $10 per person.
Once inside the park you can see dino digs, fossils, and much more - the biggest attraction is to go inside the T-Rex's head.

Be sure to visit the Gift Shop inside the brontosaur.
Here , you can buy several gifts in Dino theme as well as many other items.
You can also pick up a "Tell them That Large Marge Sent you" T-Shirt.</text>

Awesome! I haven't been since I was a child and just took my 7 year old on the way back from Palm Springs. This place has been upgraded big-time and my kid loved it.  A must stop for kids.< /Review>

The classic roadside attraction experience! Definitely not one to miss. Make sure you get a dino-themed ice cream treat while you're here, and take lots of pictures in their garden walk.< /Text>

I'm glad we didn't go just to see the dinosaurs. The best ones are in the parking lot. Took a few selfies, carried on driving.< /Review>

It's was fun for a one time experience.  The tickets are a little pricey in my opinion.< /text>

I love this place.  I know it’s probably more for kids but it’s so much fun.

$13 adult fee to enter the park but it’s a once in a lifetime (or for me twice) to get in and go.  I can’t remember the kids fee but it was about half that.

Great for kids. The park is small but there are lots of mini activities for kids inside.  Probably better for the smaller kids though.<//Text>

<text>One of the greatest roadside attractions we came across in a few thousand miles of roadtripping. Located conveniently just off the highway. Well worth a stop to take some great photos.  This is kitsch roadside America at its best! It's also worth spending a few dollars to go inside the dinosaur park.... especially if you have kids with you (which we didn't, but it's still silly fun). Buy a bag of rocks mixed with bones or semi precious stones then sift through it at the panning station. Dig through the sand pit to find stones with dinosaur names on them which you can redeem for a prize at the store. Climb up inside the head of the T-rex. Wander around and see some interesting dinosaurs in the gardens. The animatronic dinosaurs in the store are fun too.
Would definitely come here again.< /text>< Resp>

<Review>Nice place to stop by on a road trip.  There's a gas station, fast food, and I believe another dinosaur area but you have to pay to get in there.  Good place to take pictures as well.< /Review>< name>

The dinosaurs look great but overall you see everything in 15minutes and there is next to no information about each dinosaur  so you don't learn anything.< /Review>

In a middle of a pandemic I do recommend this place. Social distancing is a must and everyone was following it. It is located in a very hot place, but in every turn and corner they have those mist of water and they cool you up. The have $1 water bottle at the store in the entrance I do recommend you getting an ice cold one before doing the walk. They have dino digs and you can also go inside of t rex all the way to the top inside of its mouth very awesome. Adults is $12 children $10 seniors $10 and children under 2 go in for free. 😁👍👍</review>

Nothing special, I thought it would be a walk through of the pink dinosaur but it's just a shop and it's very small, can't even look out the window.< /text>

<name>Charl Lee</name><Review>Come on! What is not to like about a few giant dinosaurs in the desert that you can quickly visit for free?? And you can't help but smile because you know it is a pretty fun, campy stop that you will take pictures at and post on social and or send to your friends and family.

IF you want to spend money they have options for you too. A gift shop and some type of your behind a fence. We were content with just the giant dinosaur photos.

We stopped
We smiled
We took funny pictured
We were impressed by there size
We wondered why they were there
We read about them
We left

I don't know if the museum is still a creationist-museum but I am happy we did not give money to them to find out.

4 stars because my expectations of fun big dinos I could take photos of for free and then get in my car and continue to Joshua Tree were met!
If you expect more than that you may be dissapointed.<//Review><response>None< /response><UserId.>108354581063423471203<//UserId.><date>1519491419501</date><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnoM_BPng_rkwvftmWBCZ1WpUpzZ0kPIyrhuHh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-WmQlv19DYDXUb0KfE3kzc1Mr-2dYkydFEDGk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1CMA-QRAypbhsVss_CgPMI0DHikLpT4en_7Jo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpxzfg-OFY4awDtqJeVRbqT8Eq8qpkEa9X7FmI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFXFgeIwy2lCo38JkiSXzfidE7xNqVJPfkPdjG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY_5Vec7YSybY8C-NmwuVIevCHuPH8NcXuuRLS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< rate>

<text>I’ve always loved stopping by to say hi to these guys when I travel through on I-10. I have fond memories of visiting these dinosaurs since it was the first really fun field trip I remember experiencing as a kid. Every time I visit takes me back to that amazing day I had as a kid. Thanks guys!< /text>< pictures>

Whenever driving down to Palm Spring, the river or Arizon with someone new in the car we always have to stop here for they can see the dinosaurs. It's really a fun place to stop and check it out. I think they even have a little exhibit you can check out. Plus in one of the dinosaurs they have the gift shop its actually pretty cool. I recommend to check it out at least once if you haven't done so.<//text>

<Text>It's a cute spot. Definitely worth the stop. It's crazy hot, so bring water. There are the 2 huge dinos. One, you go in the tail, and there is a gift shop. You can walk around there and take a few photos. There is a burger king next door. You can grab lunch and eat at a table under the dino.

Follow the signs to the attraction. For $12 bucks per adult, you get entry. It's cheaper for kids and military. There is another gift shop, with animated dinos. A penny machine. And attack bees.

No joke. The bees attack your face! Over and over. They were attacking a lady with her 3 kids! I told the guy in the gift shop, and all he said is, it's illegal to kill bees. Well, people are allergic, so maybe they should do SOMETHING???

Anyway, then you get to pan for "gold", which is rocks. Kinda like mining. You get some, and rinse them. You get a baggie to keep some. If you're lucky, you can find one with a dino name. You take it to the front for a prize. Nobody found one.

There are more dinos out there. But, the attack bees just make you want to get out of there. When you get to the dino, you can climb up. There are 2 flights of stairs. Then a spiral stair case that takes you to the head.

The spiral case is SUPER steep and narrow. And inside the head, can only fit 2, maybe 3 people at a time. So if it's busy, it's gonna be hot and stuffy, and  crowded.

Totally glad we did it. But it's a one and done kinda thing. Visiting the dinos is great for everyone. But climbing up into the dino might be a challenge for young kids, elderly, and people with physical challenges.</Text><UserId.>104391725146946372378< /UserId.>< user_name>

This place is pretty cool. When you arrive the first thing you see is a massive Trex and  Apatosaurus I believe that's the name...inside this dino is a gift shop.  Once your done and if it happens to be Fri, Sat, or Sunday you will find the the Wafflesaurus truck which sells cake infused waffles in a shape of a T-Rex topped with premium ice cream. Once your done you can pay your $13 for adults and $11 for children 2yrs and above. Well worth it you get to see  50 awesome dinosaurs along with dinosaur dig, fossil panning and having access to climb into Mr. Rex. By this time your little one's will be exhausted but not enough to leave without going to the  gift shop which has robotic moving dinosaurs and super unique dinosaur toys and about three large dino egg props to take some awesome pictures. My 3 yr old had a blast....will definitely come back.</text>

Great place for a quickie fun picture worthy attraction. Best part is free and part of the area's history. Read in their museum the dinosaurs were built and designed from a gentleman that worked on Knotts Berry Farm too.
Great memories here. Take the kids< /Review>

Fun spot to take my kids. Long drive from SD. Wish it was a little bigger. Climbing in the big T-Rex was amazing</review>

A walkthrough of different types of Dinosaurs. With benches sit down areas.. Then you get to go inside this big enormous T-Rex all the way to it's head and you are able to lool through it's teeth. Pretty cool for young kids.< /text>

I love this place and I have seen alot of it change and grow. They have add more dinosaurs since I was a kid. But the best is always T-Rex. I recommend this place to see if you are ever near by.<//review>

This place has been around for at least 30 years now. My kids used to love to stop and see the dinosaurs (2) on our way to the river. Now, today I took my grandaughter there. They have a lot more than the original 2 they started with. And some are animated (move their heads, mouths, and growl.) Great place to stop and let the kids get a break from a long drive, or even to run out to for the day, as we did.<//text>

The best part are the dinosaur sculptures which are free.  The brontosaurus has a gift shop inside along with a small display on the history of the structures.  Ownership seems to change every few years with the current incarnation having a serviceable collection of Southwest souvenirs and curios.  Park, walk around, take some great pictures, and drive on.<//review>

<Review>Cabazon dinosaurs are awesome. We always stop for the kids to see them and buy toys. Prices are reasonable, some of the toys are overpriced, but not all.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I loved the movie The Wizard as a kid. And always said that I wanted to see these. I unknowingly passed by here once in the past. Today we went right at sunset. It was beautiful. Great photos the staff was very friendly. Cute gift shop. Of course I am a little bias as this is something I have wanted to do for a long time.< /review>

It is a beat place to visit but I would not advise going there in extreme heat it gets hot inside the dinosaurs and yes you can go inside and climb to the top and look out of the head of the dinosaurs. And there are a few places to dine and get gas</Review></record>

My kids are a little old to take at this point,  but I had to do it.  So,  off to the side there's a museum like place and gift shop.  Its alright to take kids between (I would say) maybe 5-ish to 8 years old and only worth the price if you hang out a while and have a picnic or something.  Which you can totally do! So,  yeah. Cool to check out once.  👍😁<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvao_hsSwoFu5IPQJDdnrPUMm0LrnMWJ_4uAiZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>If you’re taking COVID seriously do not go into the T-Rex. There is no regulation of people going in or out. We were about to walk in when we saw about 12 people hanging out in the entrance. We waited for them to come out and went in only to get to the T-Rex mouth and have another family close behind. I had to ask them to stop and not proceed any further. We had to pass them on our way out though. The employees were wearing masks and they had hand sanitizer at counters. The bathrooms were clean and the doors stay open when not occupied. It was 100 degrees so we zoomed through the other dinosaurs but were able to mostly maintain a safe distance from others.< /text>< pictures>

A nice stop in the middle of the desert, simple fun. It's something I saw in Peewee's Big Adventure that I've always wanted to visit and it's much better than I thought. I assumed there would only be the crontosaurus and the tyrannosaurus, but they also had a nice little shop and a walking path with more dinosaurs.< /Review>

<date>1546741500801<//date><rate>5<//rate><review>This is a great roadside attraction with dinosaur garden walkthrough, an area where you can pan for gems and little fossils as well as a sand pit where if you unearth a special rock you get to exchange it for a fun souvenir!! The best part is climbing to the mouth of their iconic t-rex. You can take a sweet photo there. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the vicinity.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_S833ExkVgBleZSzBx48X7Gx7bVHMbplKpR4x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Fun to see the giant dinosaurs but not accurate by any means and it is in fact a creationist museum. So throw your scientific brains out the window. But if you are going to have a cute distraction with kids then it's a great pit stop.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Great unusual / quirky stop to have a look at and experience the gift shop inside the biggest dinosaur but admission is a little steep for what is inside.
But some good photo opportunities and kids get a kick out of the Dino dig searching for rocks to redeem for a prize< /text>< Pics>

<Text>So we went on a weekday which is pretty nice because it wasn't packed because there wasn't anybody there but our family of four and there was only two employees in the whole place and we had to explore everything by ourselves. So it was neat for the kids but this place definitely needs to keep up the dinosaurs if they're going to be charging that much.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiEQSwhNYLDL9k3efR5Wo_bLhAv1425sZ5wcBj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>It's good for young kids but smaller than I expected. Plenty of dinosaurs of many sizes and being able to go inside a couple of them was cool. Probably worth a visit to pass time with kids on long trips but not somewhere I would go out of my way to see again.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>My 2 year old loves dinosaurs. So he loved and enjoyed this place soooo much.  It's fun and adorable.  Would give it a 5 star review if it had a little bit more to do.  For example maybe a reptile petting zoo. Also the gift shops have a lot of neat things but the prices are kind of ridiculous.  Almost everything was 20 bucks and up. All in all was worth coming since we don't live to far. Would definitely come back if they added on to it a bit more<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I don’t know how accurate it is about them being the biggest in the world, but they are pretty big. Please note it is a museum, sort of like a tourist trap that charges around $15 bucks. Fortunately, to take pictures outside is free, which honestly is the highlight of the museum—even though if you do pay, you can go inside the T-rex all the way up to the mouth where you can view the freeway. They do maintenance pretty often, I assume, because they always look brand new. Well, cretaceous new. Definitely a must if you’re road tripping in the socal deserts!< /text>

I love Cabazon!! Since I was a child we always stopped here on the way to LA to check out the awesome dinosaurs! They have a T-Rex and a Brontosaurus (there's a little gift shop inside). Whether you have kids or not, definitely stop at this place for a cool photo!< /Review>

This is such a cool place to stop at off the freeway. If your kids love dinosaurs, you have to visit this place. I mean, there is HUGE dinos. You can even go inside one to go to the gift shop. It's a fun and educational stop.</Text>

This is an awesome place to take the kids and enjoy ginormous Dinosaurs,  you can even climb up T-Rex's Mouth. My kids and even us grown ups enjoyed every second here, they got a store full of dinosaurs stuff. Take your kids, they will have a great time here, not pricy at all,<//Review>

Great stop when you feel like you're in the middle of no where.  The entrance fee I thought was more than a bit high, 12$ per adult/child, kids under 2 free... but if your child is at all into dinosaurs then I'd definitely make this stop. There are life like dinosaurs that come to life when you walk by them in the gift shop as well as huge dinosaurs that you can crawl up the inside of and look out the mouth.  You can see those guys from the freeway.  They look pretty real, much fun for those that love to say RAWRRR!<//review>

<text>A great place to visit. Whole family loved it especially our 3 year old niece. The long neck dinosaur has a neat toy shop in the belly you have to walk up some stairs to get to. There is also a T-Rex you can apparently climb into his mouth but you had to pay to go into the garden musum and we unfortunately already spent alot that day so we hope to check that part out next time.  My sister said it was $12 to go in when we went but the long neck was free unless you want to buy a toy;) pretty cool and cute toys.</text><gmapID>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134<//gmapID><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfr4YNZ3EqCS1U9zSyNEHXMZo-vzpY-eFqfi9r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Time>

<Review>This is a great place to get an Instagram of ur friends! Family friendly too. Best to go when the sun is up so u can really see the dino’s. The other visitors were all pretty nice when we went. One family even took our picture for us. Keep the culture friendly!</Review>< Response>

<Text>What's not to love about Giant cement dinosaurs in the desert?  Keep an eye out for the subtle hints at dinosaur creationist theory.  On a side note - skip this awful gas station and the worst most decrepit Burger King on earth.  Drive down a few miles to Morango and get the buffet or go to In-N-Out.  Also - I did not pay to go inside the dinosaur, neither should you.< /Text>< date>

<rating>5<//rating><review>An old time road trip quick stop just for fun. You can grab a bite to eat and check out the Dinosaurs. A well maintained arear with two giant Dino's. They have a T-Rex and a Brachiosaurus. Not a whole day event but worth making a short detour!!!

My family stops anytime they are in town to take a pic of the kids with the Dino's. It's just a thing. I took my kids this time and they lived it also! The store and the spot itself is nothing special. We did go during covid so idk  how much more there is to it than just taking a pic and going in the gift shop, which was expensive! I guess that is to be expected though all in all a cool spot for the littles.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>This was a really fun place to visit. They had a ton of Activities to do (but you have to pay - like the gemstone mining). They had a wonderful and delicious ice cream truck outside. With dinosaur shaped waffles! The only part I didn't like was the high price of everything. But it was still so fun to experience.< /Text>< Pictures>

Random fun stop for kids and parents.  We came at night this time and enjoyed a quick Pokemon Go stop to break up our long drive.
Not our first time and won't be the last.  Great photo opp spot.<//text>

You know what you're getting... big dinosaurs. It's a little pricey for what it is, but you've definitely gotta go see it at least once. The kids enjoyed it and I even got a kick out of climbing up in the t-rex. Good times.</text>

One of the dinosaurs has a gift shop inside up the stairs. It's so adorable. Expensive. I've seen the same products for half the price on Amazon. Just be weary of the other travelers there as well. Not everyone there is a tourists. There are many homeless people near by so don't walk away from your children or belongings. The grounds are a bit dirty from trash and cigarettes, but over all it's a wonder place for the kids to see some dinos.</review><userid>108696665171057765929</userid>< Rating>

This is just a cool spot. I'm a SoCal native and I haven't stopped here in years. I decided it was time to take the kids here on pur way to bowling. I forgot how cool the little shop inside the brontosaurus is. They've got all kinds ds of dinosaur nick-backs postcards and t shirts. This is also where you buy tickets for the robotic dinosaur museum behind the big dinos. We didnt go in the museum thing as I didnt want to spend almost 50 bucks for the 4 of us to get in so I cant tell you how that is. Anyhow, I wish the restaurant was still here. Used to stop and eat at the Wheel Inn when I was a kid. Attached a bunch of photos. Enjoy!</Text>

During this covid 19 out break, it smells like sanitizer lol.
Lots of great fun. Sometimes there is a ice cream truck parked, it takes a LONG LONG time for their freshly cooked cookie ice cream thing, but it's great.
Plus a Burger King and a Mexican restaurant are nextdoor.</Text>

Stop by again this year and was happy to see the dinos got a bit of a makeover. Looking more lively with the new paint job the got. The brontosaurus is actually a gift shop, pretty neat inside. Always worth the stop here for a quick photo sesh. There's actually a dino exhibit but I haven't checked it out.<//Review>< Pics>

Still fun for kids to stand next to the big models, but it's a Christian narritive of the dinosaur story. Instead of a scientific history.<//Text>

<Text>Tell 'em Large Marge sent ya!

This is the place. The PeeWee's big adventure dinosaur spot.

I'm sure it was more quaint, quiet and quirky in 1985 than it is now. The Wheel-In diner seems to have been replaced by a homogeneous Shell station. There's the constant hum of traffic, people going to a nearby hotel casino and outlet stores.

But still, the dinosaurs still stand. A testament to another time.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO15gCqcxjF8xWjHqmOWK4B8pUNkkZwpCvnB-Yd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNja7sfDF5bgWtZXQUtlgu-myRS0Yg90ef5IhFH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

It is a nice place to stretch the legs. When I arrived it was lunch so I didn't take the tour to go inside so I dont know if it is worth it. There is no charge for access and picture on the outside.

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I remember growing up and traveling by and stopping  as a kid. It use to be the only place around for miles. Things have changed but still very cool to stop and see it. This place use to be in  a few movies back in the day so a little nostalgia visit here. They are huge but cool to see. To bad the original restaurant  is gone, but has a few other places to eat near by. Dont forget there is a gift shop inside the brontosaurus... its a stop you should make when going by... these old places are disapearing all the time.< /text>< gmap_id>

High price for a short walk around dinosaur statues, but climbing inside the giant T-Rex and getting a prize for finding a rock in the sand pit made it all worthwhile.</review>

Excellent and cool place, Ezekiel, the attendant was exceptional, explained everything and gave us a nice little tour, was very friendly! Because of experiences and people like that I will keep on coming back! Excellent place that's fun for kids and adults but the service especially that of Ezekiel puts it over the top!</review>

This is a postcard worthy stop. I've been visiting Dinny the Dinosaur and Mr. Rex since I was a child, and finally was able to continue the tradition with my own child this year. Unfortunately there was a power outage when we arrived, so we couldn't go inside the dinosaurs or visit the new expansion, but I definitely look forward to returning. I chuckle every time we visit knowing Pee-wee's Big Adventure was filmed here.<//text>

Maybe it was fun 50 years ago but not anymore. We were on our way to the outlet so we stopped by to take a look. It was fun for my 3 years old to see those giant dinosaurs. Will not visit again and wouldn’t recommend either!</review>

Just two big dinosaurs on a service road.  It's maybe not worth driving out of the way for, but it's something to take some pictures of.< /review>

<user>116760416918942476722</user><Name>Maribabaz</Name><Review>One of my favorite places to stop through when I’m going to LA

I love taking the kids to see the inside of the longneck and explore your surroundings around the other dinosaur 🦖 🦕

what a great places to stop and take lots of photos 📸 of your family 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 because if they were there when I was a kid sure that be there when you’re grown to take pictures of my own grandkids there.

Little pricey to check out some of the other attractions but if you have the time and the money 💵 I’m sure you won’t be disappointed because this is a very cute and wonderful experience to share with your family or for yourself< /Review>< date>

<text>Neat roadside attraction. I've wanted to visit ever since I saw this place in the Peewee Herman movie as a kid. The two main dinosaurs are HUGE! The view from the top of the T Rex is great. Great stop if you have kids, they'll have lots of fun looking at the random smaller dinosaur statues inside the fence.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Super fun for the kids!  It's very easy to get to from the I-10 freeway, and has food and gas off the same exit.  There are 2 gift shops, one inside the paid entrance area, and the other is inside the giant Brontosaurus.  You do have to use the restroom in the Burger King as there is not one in the dinosaur attraction itself.< /Review>

$13/adult, $11/child is a pretty steep price to pay. It's small. Not a whole lot to see or do. But if your kids love dinosaurs they would enjoy it.< /review>

Fun place to stop if you have kids. Very interactive, kids can find "fossils" to turn in for a prize, and a gold/rock panning station, but don't expect to learn much about dinosaurs here. They have two gift shops which seem to be the main focus.</review>

Fun stop for the kids. The attraction and gift shop is pricey but understandable. Would avoid the gift shop if you have little ones under 5. Nice relaxing and very windy spot.</text>

<Text>We take our sons here every so often and come here by ourselves at times. It's a beautiful place nestled at the foot of the mountains. It's a great spot to take pictures, and if you're into dinosaur gear, both of their gift stores have everything you can imagine.</Text>< Rate>

Good for kids and family. My two year old was scared of the dinosaurs inside they move and make noise but he loved the outside part and it was awesome that we got to go into the mouth of the Giant Trex<//Text>

<Review>This place is amazing! The people are so nice. We came a last minute thing. We didn’t even realize there was a little adventure walk there we just came to see the Brontosaurus and the T-Rex . The people were so nice. It was my niece’s birthday they let her right the animatronic T-Rex for free and gave her a gift bag of goodies.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Great place to visit if you're coming from Arizona! You can stop with your kids and have a great time. Only down side is past the appeal of dinosaurs you can enter inside, there isn't much in the form of fun activities.< /review>

<rate>3</rate><Resp>None</Resp><Text>Worth a stop but not very scenic around the dinosaurs - so photos don't turn out great (you have to get them from the right angle to avoid the Burger King in the background). Still, pretty kitschy and fun if you're driving by anyway you might as well stop in and go inside the shop which is inside one of the dinosaurs!< /Text><GmapID>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134< /GmapID></record>

Great fun for the kids! A bit short and pricey, but overall a good experience. Take time to do the dinosaur dig. There are prizes at the end.< /text>

I was disappointed, but only because it's changed so much from my childhood. It's no longer the fun place next to Cabazon outlets. Now it's built up with fast food places and charges $13 per person to enter. The kids found it interesting enough to sit on the brontosaurus' feet before returning to the car.</Text>

Great stop for the kids. The price seems a little high for what it is, however, our son had a good time and so did we. Dinosaurs need some maintaining but the large large was fun to go into.</Review>

Cheesy roadside attraction as expected. The five year old enjoyed it and there were lots of fun things to look at and a few activities. If it was about half of what we paid for two adults and a child ($30) I would have enjoyed it a little more. If you are passing through with kids and they need to get out and strech their legs for an hour or so it's a good stop.</review>

$20 to Pee!

When we finally made it there (after 1hr drive), my niece had to use the restroom, she's 3 and I thought this would be no problem. I was really upset when I asked the ticket person  about the restroom and she directed me across two parking lots to a burger king. If anyone knows kids and esp little kids, when they tell you they have to go THEY HAVE TO GO! THEN AND THERE. She WOULD NOT have been able to hold it across two parking lots. I asked her if I paid the ticket price that if I would be able to go to the restroom and she said "yeah if you pay the ticket price you can use the restroom" $20 dollars later I took her inside to the restroom which was around the corner from the entrance and she was able to go. I don't understand why someone couldn't just escort us to the restroom? After using the restroom we left, never came back even tho I had bought a ticket, didn't feel like leaving my family (7 people) outside in the 100° weather while my niece and I looked around inside, and on top of that we had gotten a call from the hotel that our room was ready, it was such a waste of money. From our view point they are inconsiderate and not all that family friendly. Won't even let a 3 year old pee<//Text>

This place was amazing for kids!! The staff was so friendly and it was affordable and really fun. We climbed to the top of a trex mouth we panned for gold and fossils and just had a blast! Highly recommend checking this out for a fun afternoon with the kids!< /review>

<review>Not worth the price of admission ($15 a person). The area is very small and the dinos not that impressive. I merely came to see the dinosaurs from Pee Wee's Big Adventure. Movie magic leaves me underwhelmed again. Seriously drop the ticket prices or you won't stay in business.<//review>< pictures>

<Time>1577780721691<//Time><text>A really cute roadside attraction, great for anyone to visit but especially families with children. There is a gift shop with lots of animatronic dinosaurs, static replicas of dinos spread out an outdoor walking path, and you can go inside the giant T-Rex that is outside the main enterance. There are also a couple of other activities for small children like panning for minerals and a sandpit fossil dig. The staff were *super* friendly. Overall, totally recommend!< /text><gmap_id>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134</gmap_id><name>Ethan Whitted</name>< rate>

< review>
Cute and kitschy rolled into one. If you have preschoolers  or younger elementary they would enjoy. For an  adult who  likes dinos, I am not sure I would recommend Mr. Rex's Adventure unless you wanted to stop and stretch your legs.  My big problem with this place is the cost. It was too $$$ for what it was. At the time of this review it was $13/adult to basically see half working animatronic and plastic dinosaurs. Go at your own risk. On the plus side, it was a great place to take pictures!</review>

It was cool to see the dinosaurs. There is a gift shop INSIDE one of the dinosaurs which is cool. But the gift shop is horrendously over priced. Fun little stop to take fun pictures but that's all.</Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><review>We came during May and it was windy, my toddler was uncomfortable and we ended up not going in. It looks nice from outside, I guess we’ll try going in next time. We just walked around for 5min right outside the place where they have the two big dinosaurs. It is an open place so if it’s windy is not worth stopping.<//review>< pictures>

Seems like it's been kept somewhat. Entrance is a little pricey IMHO. But kiddies loved it. Just running around the outside was enough to entertain them.<//text>

Things around and even the colors of the dinosaurs have sure changed over the years. The truck stop restraunt has been torn down and two fast food restaurants have taken its place, a Jack n the box and a Mexican fast food place. Trucks are not even allowed by the Dinosaurs. But I still give it a 4 star rating. They are the Cabazon Dinosaurs, and at least they are still there, and still standing.<//review>

<text>There sure have been some changes done here. You have to stop just for the history alone that these dinosaurs have. The Pee Wee Herman movie and just the longevity od their existence. Wont take you too long to see all there is to see. Geared for young kid's. Grab a bite to eat or bring a picnic.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Even tho it is a little rundown, The Cabazon Dinosaurs is a great place to go especially if you have little ones. The "park" if you will; isn't all that big which means you'll spend at least and hour or 2 there. There's many photo ops, mechanical dinosaurs and gift shops with some cool merchandise. Definitely a great place to visit at least once!<//Review>

Don't expect a lot of activities, it's like visiting an outdoor Dino museum, with some added extras like climbing up a T-Rex to look through its caged mouth, or pan for precious rocks. Inside the gift shop at the entrance you also get to experience some dinosaurs that make noise and move when it's motion sensors are triggered. We added this to our list after going to desert hills premium outlet. It is not worth a trip on its own, unless you or the kids really like dinosaurs that much.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We went here because the movie of pee wee brought us there.
Its actually bigger than what I had imagined. There's also a store, a bit pricy but there's alot of dinosaur stuff. If your kids are into it  then this is a piece of heaven.

Bonus you can get inside the trex and climb to its mouth< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYNjt_D3HJx1J0OojuaskgXgX3MTyRk9XGAJau=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

<text>C'mon what's not to love, it's quick, easy, a place to stretch your legs after a long drive for some goofy cool photo ops, even in the dark, (apologies for the dark pix). Worth the stop as it won't throw off your road schedule. Take some pix, grab a bite, jump back on the highway literally adjacent to the freeway. Wish they'd add more over the top dino's to the mix because... MERICA!< /text><username>D. Bee</username><gmapID>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134<//gmapID>< Pictures>

The dinosaurs are cool to stop at and take some pictures. I wouldn't recommend going inside though, there's a reason there's a "no refunds on museum tickets" sign.

After the original owners death this place was sold to some creationists who have taken over the "museum" to push their nonsense. They literally have a sign saying that dinosaurs are in fact not extinct, because the Loch Ness monster is real. Take your kids to a real museum, they have way cooler dinosaur stuff that's accurate science.<//text>

<Review>Stopping here was a family tradition for my family and I as we were growing up. It had been 8 years since I'd been here, so I was definitely going to stop by with my own daughter to continue our tradition. The place is small, but the attention to detail is great! Both gift shops were stocked with awsome finds you and your family/ friends/ travel buddy's are sure to find some cool knick knacks to remember the place with. Also their is an old news paper article  in the entrance of the Brontosaurus shop, that teaches you when the first dinosaur was built and by who. Pretty cool little fact to learn as I was unaware of how these dinosaurs got their. If you're looking to stop here definitely do! So worth it!</Review>< pics>

My husband has been visiting since he was a kid. He introduced me. Then we introduced our kids today. They loved it. Especially our 3 year old. It was windy & the gift shop a little over priced, but worth the memories/pictures. We didn't go into the pay area. #tradition</review>

What a disappointment to see the fences that have been built and that they are charging an admission now to go up close. I did not pay and thankfully have my childhood memories still.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

It's a classic road-side attraction. A great place to stretch your legs and take a cheesy photo. It has a surprisingly nice gift shop with great quality plush dinosaurs.</text>

This is one of those roadside attractions that might be worthwhile if you have a dinosaur fascinated child. It might also be worthwhile if you need to use the facilities or just need a pit stop. Beware though that to use the facilities you will not be alone and there will be a wait.

We stopped this past trip from the LA area and driving back home. It was an ok pit stop but I didn't not feel the need to pay to see the whole attraction. There is a gift shop inside the dinosaur in the front of this place. At least I can say I've stopped here the next time I come out to California.< /text>

<text>So much fun. It was worth the stop. I didnt even go into the main exhibit but I had such a fun time. Also for you gamer bois and girls it has the t-rex that the game developers for fallout new Vegas used for reference. It even has the same sign and gas station out front.< /text>< UserId.>

Love stopping here on the way to Grandma's.  I think there was so renovation done recently because the ground looked really well kept and the dinosaurs seemed more life like and ready to come to life at any moment.. Ah!
There is a museum I discovered on my last visit looked so cool from the fence.
Well stop at next time.. But for you schedule a little extra time here and enjoy what this stop has to offer because it's more than just picture opportunities.</text>

The dinosaurs at Cabazon are a must stop area for my family every time we are on the 10 freeway. We have been stopping here for 20 years and look forward to many more stops. Great place to stop and grab a bite, use the facilities and of course see the dinosaurs!< /Review>

The dinos themselves are in good shape. The surrounding area is a bit rundown. Still it's a good nostalgic quick roadside stop for movie fans.< /review>

This place is a fun destination while traveling between Eastern and Western Riverside County. It's a good Midway point to stretch out your legs and take some fun pictures. Food and gas are in the area also. Think of it as a one stop shop for all your traveling needs.</Text>

I love coming here every now and then to check out the dinosaurs. It's a great stop on the way to Palm Springs or if you're heading to the casino nearby. Very windy, so bring a jacket.</Review>

<text>One of the most unique places to go in our state. The fact that the exhibit is surrounded by open desert adds to the nostalgia. Picture Pewee Herman sitting in T-Rexes mouth as the dawn breaks while your there, makes you part of and exclusive club called "The Hermanvore". Welcome!</text>< pictures>

< review>
I have wanted to stop by here since I was 6 years old!  What a great place.
I pulled over here a couple weeks back (mostly because my spouse wasn't in the car :) And our "old man Schitzu didn't mind, so off we went.
These dinosaurs are huge and beautiful!  My favorite is the Brontesaurus.  Yes, I'm aging myself, and I'm still calling them that!
When I was a kid, she was green. Of course, when I was a kid, there were only the dinosaurs...
I was so impressed. There is a little outdoor museum you have to pay to go into.  I did not. Maybe one day.
I'll come back to visit the T-rex, as he's invited me to lunch!<//review>

A must stop when traveling. Not an all day hang out but good to stretch and see these iconic monsters up close. Plus even though it's a hot area there's always a breeze, lol, or more.</Review>

We pulled off to get gas. These are really awesome. There eyes glow at night. If you pull at night for a snack its worth a drive by. I am sure kids will think it a treat.<//text>

So.... this is one of those places where I would not go back to. The staff were nice but I definitely would not pay to go into the pay area. If you happen to be driving by, just stop and get a couple pictures in front of the two big dinosaurs out front for free - that is cool and that is why I gave it three stars. I do not recommend going into the pay area.</Text>

Fun, short stopover before Palm Spring. We did not pay to see the rest of the dinosaurs since we don't have kids. I imagine it would be quite fun for the little ones. The two superstars were the two dinos outside and they are free to see!< /Text>

Great road side attraction. You can go inside the brontosaurus during business hours and explore their giftshop. To go into the T-Rex is $15, and that comes with a pseudo museum experience. I can't say how that is, I didn't pay. Definitely worth checking out.< /Text>

Stopped by briefly. Kids liked the 3 giant animals. Best part, if you don't want to pay, no problem, you can park and still be able to go close to 2 of the giants easily.<//text>

Very cool place to stop while traveling. Unfortunately we were an hour past close and couldnt go in but will make sure to next time. If it's open make sure to stop and go look around or even if its closed well worth the stop< /Text>

<text>a little stop to take some pictures. There are a little place to see more history about dinosaurs with a entrance fee; you have 2 choices of food, an ice cream truck and gas station with grocery store.</text>< user>

We pulled over for a quick leg stretch on our way North. We didn't have time to visit the museum but my husband was thrilled to get a large Marge shirt at the gift shop inside the Brontosaurus.</Text>

The first dinosaur here was the Apatosaurus , it was built by Claude Bell who was a sculpture for Knott's Berry Farm. Claude owned a cafe here and built the dinosaur to bring in customers. He started construction in 1964 and completed it 11 years later. He named it Dinny! Mr. Rex was built in 1981.

Claude died in 1988 and the family sold the property in the mid 1990's

If I were to rate this place on the two original dinosaurs alone I would give it a solid 5 but as a whole experience it is lucky to rate a 2.

These two magnificent examples of American Roadside Attraction art have become front-men to promote the new owners agenda.

The new owners are Young Earth Creationists, they denounce science and evolution while stating that the fossil record is wrong and that man and dinosaur walked the earth at the same time! Now if they want to believe that I guess it's their own business, if they had flyers you could pick up in the front office stating their beliefs I would be okay with that because it would be up to me to pick it up and read it but the grounds are littered with large red and yellow signs stating their beliefs, they are unavoidable. There is even a large sign inside poor old Mr. Rex.

I am both amused and saddened that anyone could believe something that can be debunked with just a little common sense but what really bothers me is that children will be exposed to this nonsense. Please don't bring children here, if you do please let them know that man and dinosaurs are separated by 65 million years.

You may be curious as to what treasures await you behind the wooden fence and be tempted to pay the entry fee so let me tell you what wonders lay ahead. Creationist propaganda and out of scale prefabricated fiberglass dinosaurs, that is all you will find in this whacked out wonderland.

If you must see the dinosaurs you can see the two original ones from outside without paying the entrance fee, so go look, take photos, then go, no need to help fund this place and help them disseminate erroneous information.<//Text>

Smaller kids enjoy stopping by to look around but not much if you're over 7 I'd say they'll lose interest quickly. Also suggest some modern upgrades. I believe this place is interesting to pee wee Herman big adventure fans as well because one of the dinosaurs were apart of the film other than that don't travel too far to come you may be a bit disappointed. Go to a museum or something. My daughter was a huge dinosaur fanatic brought her here at 4 yrs old age was fascinated but lost interest fairly quickly.< /text>

Very cool to see in person. I've wanted to see it all my life since it is in two of my favorite movies of all time. The 3 stars is how they've modernized it. I love how it used to look with desert all around it and wide open. Now it has small paths with some kind of ground chips and a fence going under the T-Rex which you also can't go up in without paying for their museum tour which is full of stuff for little kids. I think the kids thing was a good idea and is spread away from the big Dinosaurs, but I think they should have left it alone. No reason to modernize things when it comes to Dinosaurs anyway.</text>

<Review>I found about this place while searching for best spots to take pictures in Palm Springs. On way driving back to home, we saw these when we got out of Palm Springs area. Glad that we stopped. There was no entry fees to check them out and take pictures. Kids loved it. Worth the stop.</Review>< Pics>

Totally not worth the money. Two adults and two kids were $44 to get in. There was practically nothing to see inside except a lot of unnecessary security cameras. The path takes maybe 5 minutes to walk through and all the animatronic dinosaurs were broken. You can climb up in the T-Rex to see the view of mountain but it's no different than what you can see from the ground. Skip this and save yourself some money.</review>

<Text>Nothing they can do about it, but it's always so darn windy there. Makes it hard to have a picnic. Just something to keep in mind if you stop by.

Dinosaurs are cool, though. Great for pictures.< /Text><user_id>104264121339839722223</user_id>< rating>

Makes a good pit stop if you're driving by. Nice place to take pictures. There's even a small gift shop inside the long neck! Only restaurant near is Burger King.<//Review>

This is a great place but it's definitely a one time visit your of place, or a kind of place you only visit once a year at most
The kids will totally love this place
Also, it's very expensive for the products they offer... But what place isn't?< /review>

This is a roadside attraction that has a lot of charm and will be a hit for kids who like dinosaurs. I've read how the dinosaurs were in bad shape but when I saw them on my visit, it appeared that they got some work done and look pretty good. Definitely worth a visit to snap some pics with the big guys but if you have kids, it's probably worth a visit to go in too. How many other chances are you going to get to climb inside a T-rex?< /Text>< Pics>

Took my granddaughter. Loved this little place. Had sensors active for some dinosaurs inside, for movements and growling.  Lots of different dinosaurs. Even baby ones, her favorite.  For any children that like dinosaurs, this is a good place to visit.<//text>

<text>What could be better than life-size dinosaurs just outside of Palm Springs? How about about a life-size dinosaur park that attempts to connect the era to Christianity? — record scratch —  what?! The brontosaurus (which houses the gift shop) and t-Rex are free to peruse from the parking lot, but it’ll cost you a few bones to enter the park, and see how Jesus fits into the narrative. BONUS: Yes, this is the dinosaur attraction you remember from Pee Wee’s Big Adventure.< /text><response>None< /response>< rate>

We went there all the way from Northridge, CA for a quick visit. Our kid loves dinosaur and he loved spending some time there. But, we were done in 30 minutes. They can clean the surrounding area a little bit more though.<//text>

Ok, that was hilarious campy fun. After years of driving by these huge dinosaurs, we finally were driving with another couple and their 2.5 year old kid, and we stopped in. The kid loved it! It was so fun seeing his reaction to all the huge dinosaurs, and walking through the park with him.

Although not huge, it was definitely bigger than we thought!

My one recommendation is bring a water bottle, or buy one of the $1 bottles of water at the entrance because theres at least 30 minutes of fun outside when you're walking with a kid, and we got thirsty in the sun :)

Also bring a camera or camera phone for all the great photo ops!

Yes, it's a little cheesy, but it's cheesy fun that we all really enjoyed, especially with a toddler.< /text>

It used to be free, I used to love stopping there. Now they added a couple of smaller dinosaurs and started charging. The big dinosaurs are still awesome and are great for taking pics but I can't see myself paying for such a small attraction.</text>

The dinosaurs are the same when I came here as a little girl. We didn't pay this time because it was a quick stop. The giftshop wasn't the best. It is more for kids and not adult visitors. I remember different selection of items before.< /text>

It was cool to see the dinosaur statues, they were mostly accurate to size, however the place itself was unwelcoming, the store inside the brontosaurus was very boring, it felt lack luster and all the windows that allowed you to see out through the top of the dinosaur were covered in boxes and bad merch< /text>

Unexpectedly cool spot to stop off at on your way to/from the Palm Springs area. We saw the giant dinosaur on the side of the freeway and swerved off to make the exit. My son loves dinosaurs and we couldn't pass up the opportunity to check it out.<//review>

It's a cool place to stop while on a road trip. It's a bunch of big ol dinosaurs in the middle of nowhere. You can get some gas, a bite to eat, and/or use the restroom, while you wonder, "why the heck are these things here"?. Great photo op.< /Review>

An awesome landmark, right next to Morongo Casino and just a mile away from Cabazon outlets. Giant dinosaurs also famous they have appeared in many Hollywood movies; the gift shop it’s really cool with great souvenirs and toys for the kids. When visiting Palm Springs this sure is a stop you want to make to get some cool
Family photos and appreciate how big the dinosaurs are...I do believe the T-rex 🦖 is friendly and willing to take selfies with all

It's a great place to take the kids. Specially if your child likes dinosaurs. They are huge. Great to take pictures outside with the dinosaurs. There's a long knock and a T Recks.< /review>

There are really huge dinosaurs for photo taking. If you want to see more dinosaurs, there is a park/museum, but you have to pay for entrance.<//text>

Still great after all these years! Only thing I missed was the shop inside the dinosaur. Hopefully it's being remodeled. It's withstood a lot of windy weather over the years. Still a great sight that brings back happy childhood memories. Love it!!</text>

<text>Fun kitschy road side attraction. We loved climbing into the 65' T-Rex and wandering through the park. They were under construction while there and finding where to pay to enter (hint, it's in the giant Altasaur at the front). Some if it is a bit dated, but would still recommend it for the unique experience.</text>< Rate>

Fun pit stop stop off the I-10 in Cabazon. I know they need to be supported to stay open but a bit pricey on the entrance fee. Lower it and they will come. Same with souvenirs... You can get the same stuff at Walmart for 70% less. Sell cheaper and make it up in volume. Still a great excursion for the kids.<//Text>

This place is small, I taught it would be bigger and maybe more interactive but all you do is walk in the walk path and see Dinos, there's description of the Dino you are seeing but other than that its just okay. Great place to take pics though!< /review>

Excellent! I thought it would be the large dinosaurs and that's it but there were lots of intricate dinosaur sculptures, some of them animatronic. My 5yo (and me) loved it! 😍< /text>

If you're on the freeway and need a place to rest or fuel up, I recommend stopping here! Get some fries and look at the dinosaurs. Why not?
Didn't opt for any of the exhibits, but definitely got some fun photos from the quick visit!</Text>

<Text>Be sure to swing by this attraction. Fun for pictures and the kids will love it. Known for being in the movie Pee Wee's Big Adventure if you are an 80's kid or a fan. There is a gift shop inside one of the dinosaurs and a dinosaur exhibit as well but I think that costs $ to go through. Always alot of people here on the weekends.< /Text>< pics>

Place was cool to visit, but not for the price. It cost me and my family (5 total) cost almost 50 bucks to walk around and look at there out dated status. Only cool thing that I liked is being able climb into the t-rex. But not worth the cost.<//text>

<username>Popeye Flyer<//username><user>115931642494659489423< /user><review>A must place for any Barney or dinosaur loving child.   Parents, just because it's not important to you, does not mean it's not important to them. Having said that, the gates dinosaur walk is , in my opinion, not worth the entrance fee. Still, there is plenty of free enjoyment for your little tyrannosaurus rexes in photo and selfie pics. You can take a look at some cheap souvenirs in the shop located inside one of the dinosaurs. Warning, there are stairs involved when entering the shop. All in all, it's worth a stop for the kids and you will be back on the road in about 20 minutes. That is unless you stop at the burger place next door.  Mom, it's also near an outlet mall and a casino not far behind. Have a safe trip.  Hawaii Don<//review>< Resp>

<Text>The Cabazon Dinosaurs park is not great and really only intended for children under 4 who can't recognize the park's shortcomings (AKA my 2 year-old son). It says the park opened in 1978 and it looks like they might have purchased one or two new dinosaurs since then. It is mostly a collection of hodge-podge dinosaur models that aren't consistent in size and 90% are some variation of velociraptor. The big T-Rex is fine and by far the only reason to go here. If you have a child under 4 that likes dinosaurs I would suggest it, only if the price of admission was $5. Unfortunately the price of admission is $13 per adult which is way too expensive for what you get. My suggestion, just look at the big T-Rex and Brontosaurus from outside the fence, then leave and get In-N-Out Burger down the road.</Text>< pics>

<Text>A neglected piece of American roadside attraction history. The dinosaurs were once a visable landmark along the freeway and part of a whole entertainment pitstop for families traveling through the desert. Now these awesome dinosaurs are a hidden campy gem for those who are willing to seek them out. If you are ever near Cabazon take a few minutes to visit the Cabazon Dinosaurs, you will not regret it.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134</gmap_id><Name>cherry 7<//Name>< Pics>

I stopped because I saw the Pee-Wee movie and I then bought a Large Marge t-shirt at their gift shop.  I later regretted the purchase because I found the site is now owned by religious zealots and evolution deniers.

EDIT:  After only 3 washes, the t-shirt has developed 3 different significant holes in it, one on an underarm seam, one on the other arm not on a seam, and one dead in the center of the back.  Jeesh!  Review downgraded from 2 stars to 1 star due to the shirt's poor quality.</review>

They claim they have the world's "only museum inside a dinosaur". The "museum", if that's what you want to call it, is not inside the dinosaur, so they are wrong on that. They have also placed cavemen in the same exhibit as dinosaurs, as they are now owned by young earth creationists who don't believe in science.  That being said, the dinosaurs themselves are quite iconic, though the whole thing is (by design) very kitschy.</Text>

These dinos have been around for a while and they are still super awesome filled with dinorific toys and other items suited for kids all the way up to adults. Not handicap friendly or accessible but if you can find someone to carry you its worth the ride. I especially love that you can find the dinosaurs that grow in water up to 600% for only 6 bucks. I tried the new ice cream truck and it was delish!!<//text>

I have great memories of visiting this place with my parents when I was very young and crazy about dinosaurs. After visiting again for the first time in over 30 years, I was a little disappointed. The dinosaurs are still great, but they seem a little run-down and could use a coat of paint. They're still fun to look at, and kids would probably still love them.</Text>

Had the best time here! I've been wanting to visit since I first saw The Wizard. "Cali-fornia!" Way more than a gift shop. Great picture opportunities all over. The dinosaurs are awesome going inside of Mr. Rex was the highlight. Very affordable too.</Review>

It's dinosaurs, and it was in Pee Wee's big adventure, so it gets some credit. But ten bucks is super expensive, and it was bought by some creationists, so the gift shop/museum is actually had cave men and dinosaurs, and a sign about how dinosaurs are dragons (and the "by design, not by chance" stuff). And there were some random modern animals mixed in with the dinosaurs outside to imply they existed together.

In the end, I had fun--because dinosaurs.<//text>

Place is cool if your into dinosaurs. But it's a little expensive to what equates to a small park with a bunch of dinosaurs statues. Gift shop was no better. Toys were outrageously expensive. 25 dollars for a small pack of plastic dinosaurs is just too much. My kids did love it though.< /Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>I have wanted to visit this place since I saw the dinosaurs in Pee-wee's Big Adventure. Unfortunately I never came went until recently. It is the perfect combination of quirk and nostalgia. I didn't have a chance to go into the actual park due to a time restraint. But the putter portion of the park and the gift shop sufficed.

Fun Rest stop between AZ and NorCal! Great pic opportunities, cute store w/inexpensive souvenirs, and great place to stretch your legs. Did not spend the money for museum but sightseeing is plentiful for family w/teens.</review>

<review>I remember this place from when I was a little kid I had to stop in and see it again now that I'm older. It was just as pleasant as when I was young I'm taking my kids there it's amazing feeling this way like I'm a child again we would drive by the dinosaurs all the time coming back from different events in the desert if I have Amazon stop in to see these wonderful huge dinosaurs it's worth the time to go check out the museum inside.< /review>< GmapID>

My kids and now my grandkids always like to stop here for a look at the dinosaurs.     It's very easy to take the exit off 1-10 and spend some minutes just looking at them.     There is a little gift shop if you'd like to spend a bit more time.   Really doesn't take too much time and it's fun for small children.</Text>

<Text>I remember my parents bringing me here when I was a toddler and having a really good time going inside the dinosaur, looking at all their merchandise and minerals. I now have a toddler of my own and she enjoys visiting this place. They have a small section with more dinosaurs and even anamatronic models.< /Text></record>

I haven't been inside the "park" yet,  but the dinosaurs have been a part of my life since childhood.  I never miss a chance to stop here when traveling that way.  My kids really want to see the "park" next time.  Be prepared with money for the entrance fee.</text>

We have been taking our son here for 3 years now. Even if we just eat lunch outside of the exhibit he always has a blast. A few more picnic tables would make it perfect.< /text>

<Text>It was pretty cool place, it is a little misleading when you get there because you only see 2 large dinos, however there is a whole area that offers much more. There are lots of little things for the kids to see and do.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-xLPiTH0001qUZooTpIctMX-0ZgBQdWXjBsSM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<text>My son loved it.  It was neat.  Kinda pricey, however, the kids get to dig for a rock with a dinosaur on it and they get it prize.  Cheap little Oriental trading prizes, but it gives the kids something to do. The T-Rex was cool. Very windy up in it's mouth.< /text>< rate>

Love taking my kids here. Just wondering why they had to close off the T-rex from people seeing and going in unless you paid for the "tour" . Oh well, maybe next time.  Still loved see them.</review>

The actual "attraction" is way over priced as well as the gift shop...$1 toys for $10 or more
Sad that most parents have to disappoint their kids because of the prices...</review>

It's about time this place got renovated.  It's sad to see all this built up around such a relic.  But good to know that people care enough to keep it going through the ages.< /text>

Not worth the money to get in as much is they charge you would think they would fix things up even the fences are falling down inside the gift shop was pretty cool but for the price to get in not worth it at all</Text>

Museum in back is way over priced and the area itself is kind of stinky. Restrooms, drinks, gas, kids lovin the dinosaurs.. overall a pretty good stop.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Fun for the kids
I remember going here when I was a kid ... glad the dinosaurs did not walk off.

Now I get the pleasure to share the tradition of having my kids look upon the giant dinos.

Plus a good break after driving for so long, bathroom break, dog walk .. yadda yadda!</Review>< Pics>

Goofy roadside attraction.

Not a museum or anything educational but fun place to stretch your legs on a long road trip.  Don't go out of your way for this or anything.< /text>

It was dark by the time we arrived, so unfortunately didn't get a clear photo of the dinosaurs, but from what I seen from my eyes this place is definitely on my list to stop at when there is light.. the place should consider placing some type of bright or at least some kind of light to show the attraction for pictures.< /Text>

<Review>If you're a child of the 80s, are a fan of roadside attractions or just love a good photo opportunity, you MUST visit the Cabazon dinosaurs while in the area. Known to children of the 80s as the dinosaurs from Pee Wee Herman, go ahead and spend the money to explore the dinosaur park and go up inside the T-Rex.</Review>< Pics>

Very well designed dinosaurs. Little tour has interactive activities for kids like a panning and a dig. A must see on way to Palm Springs especially if you have kids!</text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>What a wonderful place! More animatronics than most places, so many dinosaur replicas. And the price is really low for what you get. I appreciated that it's not a museum that bogs you down with scientific theory mumbo jumbo. Just known facts about the different creatures. Great for kids! In fact, geared for kids. The admission includes panning for neat little rocks that you can keep, and "digging" for a prize. All these commercialized parks make you pay for every little thing. The staff is so helpful and friendly! Lastly their gift shop is all dinosaur; there is no place else in southern California where you can find such a range of dinosaur toys. If you you have little ones that are crazy about dinosaurs you will not find a better place for gifts. A definite stop for anyone going along I10 between the IE and palm springs.  And plenty of shady spots with tables for picnics!< /Review>< resp>

<Review>For the price of the attraction (13.00$) it should be kept up better. The majority of the  fencing was destroyed. The signs haven't been painted since I probably was a child. Alot of the  displays over grown not even visable. TRex stinks inside, and you can't even see out his body windows. Something I remember and a highlight as a child. Very dissatisfied.  Glad I went alone and didn't take my kids. And I live in Ventura CA< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Cool place for kids to check put while others are shopping at Cabazon or at casinos. Tickets to see motorized dinos are $13 for adults and $11 for kids. Very small exhibit but somethung for kids to do.<//Text>

Never watched Pee Wee Herman so I have no nostalgia about this place, but my 4 year old loves dinosaurs so we made the trip over from Palm Springs. He loved the giant dinosaurs from the outside and was super excited to go inside one!
We paid to go in to the inner part, basically a garden with paths and nice flowers interspersed with dinosaurs of various sizes.

Kids enjoyed the "dig site"  but it could have been done a lot better. Rather than finding a rock buried with T-Rex or triceratops written in sharpie, could have had kids find a few rocks drawn with feet, a body, and a head or something a little more like a fossil dig.

Price seemed a bit steep for what you get, but the kids had fun so we are happy with the visit. Bring a camera for some fun pictures.</Text>

It's fun my grand son who is 2 years old of course loved it so it made the visit fun but that much money for this I think in my opinion is over priced. Make sure you go with little grand children at least one time is enough< /Text>

<text>I didn't go in the dinos, but I'm sure they're more impressive from the outside anyhow.  It's unfortunate that about 100 feet away you'll find some of our nation's finest fast food joints.  This is truly a roadside attraction, so don't expect to spend a day, or even an afternoon here.< /text><rate>3<//rate><user_name>Adam Michaels (adam.m)<//user_name><Time>1479491451522<//Time>< pictures>

Been here a few times now as a break on our PHX-LA trips. You can take photos of the giant tee Rex and brontosaurus for free. They also have a place you can go inside and tour as well. At $13 per adult, it's quite overpriced for a 30-minute tour of rubberized dinosaur statues, but our daughter enjoyed it, and price gouging is expected at roadside attractions.

Gift shop has cute tshirts w/Cabazon dinosaurs on it and a handful of specialty items, but is mostly filled with the same dinosaur toys you can buy at Target for significantly less, so don't fall for their nonsense. Overpriced (-1 star). They always ask for my ID when I’m here and purchase with my credit card which I find annoying. Who’s using a stolen credit card to buy some cheap azz dinosaur toys that break on the ride home?! I’d like to know.< /Text>

<Review>If you are a kid who loves dinosaurs, this is heaven. It's outside in the hot, dry desert. There are a couple of things to do... and a whole lot of dinos to see! There are animatronic ones in the gift shop. But the end of the trail leads to Mr. Rex... and you can climb the very steep and narrow stairs, which get even smaller at the top (obviously not built to today's codes)... to peer out the mouth through Mr. Rex's teeth. There is another gift shop inside the Donny. It's a good hour of fun.</Review>< Response>

Lotta staged dinosaurs scenes but barriers too tall and too obvious, so very difficult to get any decent shots. Can walk up to T-rex head. Entrance fee $10/head. It's outdoor, so going in fall & winter is more preferable.</Text>

<Text>I grew up making regular visits to this attraction back when it was reputable.  It pains me to see that creationist lunatics have bought it and have turned it into the opposite of it's original educational purpose.  The sculptures built into the gift shop walls now have signs deriding them posted under each one, and claiming most of paleontology is a series of hoaxes and scams.  The place now is no better than one of those Creation "museums".</Text>< rate>

<review>Cheesy Roadside Store - still a neat little slice of time-warped heaven. Nothing's been changed since the 60s, inside or out. Something cool for those few kids who still appreciate toys and fossils.
Been here my whole life and just now seeing this place for the first time.</review>< pics>

The two dinosaurs were cool to see. But the gift shop was too pricey and so was the entrance fee to see the other dinosaur exhibits.</review>

It was cool walking in a dinosaur and taking pics with a brontasaurus and t rex but the price to walk through their garden area was a bit too rich for my blood. Overall it was cool to say I was there.<//review>

We didn't go in the visitors center, but for a couple of overgrown children (adults) who love dinosaurs, this was a fun stop along I-10 for the perfect photo op.</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I used to come to this place almost every weekend because my mom would gamble at Morongo. I was about 8-9 years old. I loved it! The luscious green grass, the lady in the gift shop was always so welcoming and the many people I met. It's a simple but fond memory that I'll cherish forever. I'm 23 years old  now and decided to take my daughter for the first time. I can't begin to express how disappointed I am. The ground is pure dirt and any grass that is there is yellow. They added some type of makeshift walk through type attraction that they make you pay for! It was garbage! Almost every dinosaur in there was broken, discolored and dirty. I saw other animals that didn't even belong there! Like lions and alligators. And you have to pay for this walk through just to get the view from inside the T Rex. The staff were all young punk kids who clearly didn't want to be there and not one was  informative or knew anything about dinosaurs. If you've never been here I guess it's okay because you have nothing to compare it too. But I wouldn't recommend trying to recapture childhood here.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>One of those kinda corny things to do along the interstate, but pretty cool. Would be aimed more for the kids I think. Good picture opportunity. There is food and gas nearby. Lock your cars, I've heard of people having things stolen here by tweakers. Literally right off the I-10. You can climb up in the dinosaurs, too. Morongo is also very close by.<//Review><date>1495558896264< /date>< user_id>

It's owned by creationists that use the attraction to push their views. The dinosaurs are fun to look at, but the signs covering the area denouncing sound science are annoying. Wasn't expecting to have creationism pushed so hard onto me.</review>

<text>There is some odd magic at this place. Looks like it was a thing back when it opened. Now it's in very bad shape and it is hard to tell how it keeps being a business.

Long drive from LA just to see these dinosaur. Finally got it out of to do list. Note: visit this place as a pit stop on an outing or if on your route. Check price for dinosaur exhibition.< /Text>

Was like twenty dollars for me and my 3 year old. Biggest rip off! The dinosaur dig is rocks with dinosaur names on them. There are not even tools like paint brushes to use. Going up the T. rex felt like a death trap and their rock mining was sedentary not worth the money either. Do not throw away your money. I wish I would have known the truth, I would have taken her to boomers for $20.<//Text>

This is my First time visiting, i had a great time at the gift shop, i bought a poster for $10 i think, and i loved it.
- Not Wheele Chair Accessible.
- Cloths Way Waaaay to expensive for the brands and for the $.05 decal use.
-Not over populate which is a huge plus.< /review>

An interesting stop to stretch your legs (especially if you're familiar with Pee Wee Herman) but the "No Refunds for Museum Tickets" gives you a sense of the quality the sites.< /text>

Nice place. We took our 3 grandkids under 4yr old and they had a great time. It's a little pricey for what it is though. There's robotic dinos in the gift shop, which are great. But outside there's a lil path with dinos ( some really fake looking some need repair), and there's a small dirt patch for the kids to look for rocks. At the end of the path you could go up inside the dino tail to his head...be real careful really hard to take small kids up this stairs are really steep and scary. It was fun and exciting for small children but not so much for older kids. Probably take no more than 1 hour to go through everything twice. Would be nice if they expanded.</Text>

Who doesn't love stopping at the dinosaurs when you driving on the I-10 freeway to or from California. The nostalgia and awe factor is really there which makes for a great photo opportunity on your road trip for sure.  They recently repainted the 2 big dinos, so they are looking new and shiny. It's nice to see that they are maintaining them, but no care were given to prevent paint fallout on the pavement, especially by Rex. A bit of a sloppy job if you ask me. The the parking lot is always very dirty, it would be nice if the grounds were maintained better, especially cause of all the foot traffic they get. The gift shop is small, stuffy and overpriced for a dusty road side attraction. The animatronic walk thru is fun and pretty cool but way overpriced. You see everything pretty quickly. I could see us going more often if the price was more reasonable for the entrance fee. So we just stick to the outside photo op.The animatronic section is reserved to a single room and the outside area has more big dinos but nothing compared to the size of the 2 main ones on road. They have concession stands inside the walkthrough but they were closed when we went. A small mining for gems and rock section was the only hands on activity available and the best part of the walkthrough was going into the T-rex and climbing to the top of his head where you have a great view over looking the parking lot. The 4 stars goes to the big dinos on the road and we will always stop to see them and take family photos.</Text>

One of the best roadside attractions out there! We did not pay to enter the museum, we only took photos next to the dinos and went into the giftshop.

Super cool spot of vintage americana history!<//review>

< Review>
This was a bucket list item for me to visit.  Every time we'd drive by here, I wanted to stop but never did for whatever reason.  I'm so glad we finally stopped and to look.  There's isn't much to see but it's an iconic location and movie spot, making this a must visit.< /Review>

<text>The two biggest dinos are in the front. Pay to see the rest. Admission includes climb inside big TRex"s mouth. Animated dinos inside. Gas station and food nearby.

Fun roadside experience that breaks up a long drive.  Cabazon reminded us of the Eccles Dinosaur Park & Musuem in Ogden Utah (which, in comparison, made Cabazon seem small and overpriced).< /text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Brian Garant<//user_name><response>None</response><Text>I'm giving this place 4 stars with some VERY strong caveats. First off, make no bones about it (ugh): this place provides nothing even remotely resembling accurate science. In fact, any allusions that you might be there on a science-filled field trip are shattered as soon as you enter the gift shop and see the ANIMATRONIC MONKEY JOUSTING A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR. Oh, and they are both riding raptors in case you thought they were afraid to go all in on the crazy here. A thing of wonder, this place is.

Once you have made peace with the fact this is essentially a "young earth" propaganda park you can begin to appreciate the amount of work that went into this place. A big percentage of the dinos are in good condition, a lot of them seem to have been painted fairly recently. I'm not sure if the overgrowth is a nice touch or just a lack of grounds keeping but, either way, it's a nice touch. I can see kids having a good time here.

Probably the most notable attraction here is the giant T-Rex from Pee Wee's Big Adventure. Unless you make a bee-line straight to it, the T-Rex is probably the last thing you'll encounter. Up a ramp and into it's very narrow stairwell you'll ascend to the mouth of the beast, overlooking the parking lot. Be careful: it is cramped in there and everything is painted a disturbing shade of red which may or may not be out of necessity. If you're not careful you might end up leaving a little paint yourself.

Thing to look for:
A golden retriever just chilling next to it's natural best friend the Brontosaurus.
A tiny maniacal dino riding atop his enslaved brother, the very picture of evil.
A lion.
A stupid concrete snake that has his big dumb head sticking out into the walkway just enough to make you think it is an actual snake for a second and, honestly, why do that?
The stretch limousine of turtles.
A huge goofy toad.

All in all, this place is harmless and could be a nice pit-stop if you and your family are stopping through. Quick note about the kids working there. An earlier review mentioned how little the kids seem to care about the people stumbling through. Fair point, when I dropped by the one kid on duty seemed as if I might have just woken him from a nap, but if you had suffer condescending jerks asking you all kinds of dumb questions day in and day out you'd probably wince every time that door opened too.</Text><Time>1423601630700< /Time>< rate>

<Time>1467357527486< /Time><rate>5</rate><review>I remembered this location where they filmed the movie called Pee Wee's Big Adventure , which was located in Cabazon. Me and my family went to Yucca Valley  to go drop off my cousin , because he is serving his time in the U.S. Armed Forces. And then we went back to visit the World's Biggest Dinosaurs for the first time in Cabazon. I also remembered the part of the movie on Pee Wee's Big Adventure,  when Pee Wee Herman was lost in the middle of nowhere, an old lady in a big rig was named Large Marge who dropped off Pee Wee at Cabazon, and this is what she says to Pee Wee . She says be sure you tell them Large Marge Sent You, and she laughs. I also remembered the other part that Pee Wee enters the diner where he told all the customers that Large Marge sent him. The customers was telling Pee Wee that he was riding with her ghosts. And that's how me and my family went to visit Cabazon for the first time ever. And we took some pictures of the dinosaur statues which was a perfect location. We also took a picture of the Wheel Inn Diner, because this was also part of the movie that was taken place where Pee Wee Herman entered. I wish I can come back real soon to see what Cabazon is like.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
I watched the first Brontosaurus being built in the 60’s. It was started with 55 gallon drums, rebar, junk steel and scrap iron welded together to make a framework, to handle chicken wire and add plaster.  Imagine, a brontosaurus with a gift shop inside. It was simply an oddity at the time, similar to but different from other oddities created to get people to stop for a bit and drop a few shekels. With the Wheel Inn next door and their wonderful pies, and an ok restaurant the dinosaur was a nice pull and things thrived. As time passes and over the decades the surrounding businesses had a newer sheen, cars zoomed by more comfortably, distances in the desert seemed to shrink a bit and progress moved forward. The dinosaur has been in scenes in a few big screen movies and even in Howser’s travel show. The dinosaur was a local oddity that simply lay in waiting for Jurassic Park. Wow! Now the dinosaur is is a huge hit. Dino upgrades are installed. Dino fever, and people and their children came in droves! Well that fervor cooled over time, the Wheel Inn and its famous pies are in the rear view mirror, the Dinosaurs are back to being a roadside attraction that continues to bring excitement to first time visitors and is always a fun stop to see the full sized dino’s and snap a few pics. Enjoy the stop, stretch your legs a bit, and dream of times long gone by. Another roadside attraction built by another visionary with  imagination and sweat her in the mini metropolis of Cabazon,  Ahh Cabazon…. Now there is another story.<//Review>

That's right,  as seen on PeeWee Herman,  these dinosaurs are huge!  The T Rex you have to pay and the Bronchiasaurus or whatever is a gift shop inside. In an ugly area,  adequate parking though. Worth a stop overall.</text>

<Review>Reminiscent of an era when Route 66 was the main thoroughfare across the Southwest. If you're into Americana and have kids who are Jurassic Park fans, this is a must-see. Only 4 stars because I thought it a bit overpriced at $12 a head.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>This place could be bigger, it could have more robotic dinosaurs not just the few that are inside the gift shop. It is good for children under the age of 7, anyone older would be bored out of their minds. heavy persons should not climb up the T-rex as the stair case is very narrow. Although people with disabilities get in free and get a free waterbottle, it is not completely disabled friendly (unable to go inside the trex) this place is not as big as the billlboad makes it seem. Not a lot of activities to do and not very educational. It can be done 20 minutes, adults shouldnt have to pay to enter.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80db3fa29b621d4d:0x14116535bfc44134</gmap_id></record>

The dinosaurs are OK but the anti evolutionary spiel in the giftshop was horrifying. Run by loonies, clearly. Should this ignorant sentiment be allowed in public?!</Text>

Dinosaurs! Like huge ones. The paid attraction is a bit lackluster, but the emmereffing bigger than a house T-Rex was awesome.<//Review>

Worth visiting for a look at these giant dinosaurs, but the inherent silliness of the creationist owners has converted the place into a fundamentalist Christian museum, full of nonsense including that the earth is only 6,000 years old and that dinosaurs are actually dragons. Don't give these snake oil peddlers a cent.</review>

<Review>It is not that big, I wish there was more things to do there, more interactions that involved the dinosaurs.

<rate>3< /rate><review>Last time I went there they were closed. I don't know if they were close just because of the time or permanently closed. The Wheel Inn restaurant is permanently closed very sad :-( that was the restaurant in the Pee Wee Herman movie I remember that as a child so sad to see it go away. I don't know if the dinosaurs also went away with it but the buildings and the dinosaurs still stand and remain just not accessible.< /review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) This place is very cool, the dinosaurs are fantastic, you can go inside the biggest ones and the pink one has a shop inside you can have a picknic day with your family since they have outdoor tables and they have bathrooms 100% recommended 😍😍😍

(Translated by Google) The shop is also open.
(However, the mask is absolutely worn)

There are several picnic areas & Burger King nearby, so it is recommended for families and groups who want to change their minds a little.

The unfortunate point is that there is no public toilet nearby.

There is a relatively clean public toilet at the nearest gas station.

(Original)
お店もオープンしていますよ｡
(ただし,マスクは絶対着用です)

数箇所ピクニックエリアがある&近くにバーガーキングがあるので,少し気分転換したい家族やグループ方にお勧めです。

残念な点が公衆トイレが近くにないという事｡

1番近くにあるガソリンスタンドには,比較的綺麗な公衆トイレあります。</text>

At the entrance there are 2 big dinosaurs the female dinosaur, her belly is the gift shop and the male dinosaur is to take pictures inside.

<Text>(Translated by Google) My children enjoyed climbing the T-rex and seeing the dinosaurs, in addition to the fossil search, at the end we had an ice cream and very delicious Apple waffle (I think the food truck is only on weekends from 1 pm until closing ), you can do everything in 1 hr maximum 2.

My kids enjoyed get in to the T-rex, the dinosaurs and the bones hunting, at the end we ate ice creand apple waffle, these are delicious. (I think that food truck is only on weekends from 1 pm until closed) you can do everything in around 1 hr, maximum 2.

Mis niños disfrutaron escalar el T-rex y ver los dinosaurios,  además de la busqueda de fósiles,  sl final comimos un helado y waffle de Manzana muy rico (creo que el camioncito de comida solo está los fines de semana de 1 pm hasta el cierre), puedes hacer todo en 1 hr maximo 2.

(Translated by Google) I really liked this place, the truth is, we did not go inside because we were only passing by and stopped only to load gasoline and eat something and we saw it and we liked it so much that we are going to go again but this time if we are going to enter, stop as if by inside outside a jungle with dinosaurs I'm not sure but it looks great.

(Original)
Me gusto mucho este lugar la verdad no entramos hasta adentro porque sólo íbamos de pasada y paramos sólo ha cargar gasolina y a comer algo y lo vimos y nos gustó mucho tanto que vamos a volver a ir pero esta vez si vamos a entrar parese como si por dentro fuera una selva con dinosaurios no estoy muy segura pero se mira padre.</review>

Is it enough to go once?

(Translated by Google) The idea is interesting, that's why I give it 2 stars, but the mechanical dinosaurs lack maintenance and the area where they are too, there were deodorants everywhere, you could see a lot of dust ... in the area of ​​the tiny path there was no Nobody to give you instructions or just for surveillance ... leaves much to be desired for the price you pay ...

(Original)
La idea esta interesante, por eso le doy 2 estrellas, pero a los dinosaurios mecánicos les falta mantenimiento y el área donde se encuentran también, había desodorantes en todos lados, se podía observar mucho polvo... en el área del minúsculo recorrido no había nadie que te diera instrucciones o simplemente por vigilancia... deja mucho que desear por el precio que pagas...</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It's not an amusement park, It's small, but it's a good place to stretch and for children to get distracted in the middle of the road.

(Original)
No es un parque de atracciones, Es pequeño, pero si un buen lugar para estirarse y que los niños se distraigan en medio del camino.< /Review>
