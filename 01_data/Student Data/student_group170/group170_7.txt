<Review>Do not get your COVID-19 test here or use this pharmacy. I do not recommend. They made me wait in line 40 minutes  with a valid appointment to tell me there's a glitch and sent me away. I waited 3 days for this appointment with my kid being sick. Not a very kind or health conscious pharmacy. Pharmacist has zero sympathy.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Amazing helpful service from Garo & Fabian!  These two made it easy to ship out several FedEx packages; Fabian actually volunteered to came out to my car to provide assistance.  They both went out of their way to make my work this evening go a little smoother & my day to finish a little better.  I encourage you to shop here and recognize these gentlemen.<//Text><user_id>101064384783777885817</user_id><gmap_id>0x80c295f34feaec7f:0xfaaa778bb33fc7fa</gmap_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< name>

I get that Walgreens feels the need to supply the drug users of the world their needles to do their thing safely. If it must be done safely is better than not but when I park and go to walk Into their store and have to dodge used needles on the ground I'm a bit worried about the safety of those of us that choose to not inject yourselves with drugs. Where does our safety become a concern. I walked around the parking lot found 1 used needle and a small baggie. See photos. Walgreens step your game up and clean up after then at the very least.</Review>

Our family took covid test here and it’s been 3 days without any word from them. When we called and asked, we were told it would take 4 days to get the result back. I said it was terrible to wait this long for something that can be done in 15 mins then I was rudely hung up. Do not recommend this location or any Wallgreens really.<//Text>

< Review>
This is literally the WORST Walgreens in Los Angeles county. The pharmacy is soooo slow, it's painful to watch them work. I have had to leave the drive thru and the indoor line so many times because of how long they took. They always say it's due to under staffing. Then HIRE MORE PEOPLE. Also they now do drive thru COVID tests here, but they are in the same line as people picking up prescriptions which makes absolutely no sense, so I had to wait in the drive thru line for 45 minutes to pick up a prescription. This is insane.</Review>

Do not go here!  We went here as we figured it would be a safe drive through option during covid. It’s not. If u want to sit in trash covering their alley while the pharmacy ignores u for 30 minutes to eventually have someone who wasn’t doing anything go ‘oh!’ Then it’s perfect. Then after waiting to pickup the completed order I had to insist they re-run the insurance because they wanted to charge me 4x as much for my prescription.  They don’t know what they are doing. Avoid!</review>

Been waiting for 25 minutes for the pharmacy to open. I need a specific vaccination for an upcoming trip and this is the only Walgreens in my area that carries the vaccine.

They were supposed to open at 9am. The staff at the front keep telling me to just wait and they have no idea when it will actually open. Don’t waste your time here unless you have no other option.</Review>

I have been a Walgreens customer for a while, my mom and I use the printing service so often I cant think of another place to print. I decided to have something printed close to home instead of close to work this time and truly regret this decision. The size of  poster board requested was not in the store, and when they printed it on a larger board the orientation was wrong and clipped a large portion of the picture. The manager on duty was called to assist me when the employee saw the mistake. When the manager arrived he proceeded to show me the misprint and said there is nothing they can do for me. At the store in Glendale where my patronage is obviously appreciated, the managers and employees have consistently gone the extra length to ensure what is ordered is what is received. The misprint not the problem, its the fact that the man in the vest had no customer relation skills.<//review>

I'd give it 3 1/2 stars to be precise. It's not bad, it's slightly above average. It's on a busy No Ho intersection w/ a lot of homeless camped at the 4 corners' bus stops. The staff & store are 'hit & miss'...sometimes, they're a big hit: U might hit the Pharmacy @ right time, but sometimes, they're a miss. You might get a very helpful staff person & easily find what you need & get an item clearly for what it's priced. But, another time you might get a vacuous stare-back from some underling when you ask for the price of an unmarked or "on Sale" item (always read the fine print: U might need to buy 2 to get it). Or, you'll overhear someone murmur "kill me now" after their 3rd trip to the pharmacy counter, asking if their Rx is ready, only to hear that they're really sorry, but it'll be another 15 more mins. Or, you might find 5 people waiting in cashier line w/ some 80 yr old lady trying to write out a check! So yeah, this Walgreen's tries...but sometimes, you'll just find this Walgreen's trying...<shrug>< /review>

Every time I want to pick up my prescription using the drive-thru it takes at least 10 minutes for the process to be done. It shouldn't take more than 5 mins.< /Review>

Pharmacy was rediculous. I was treated very poorly. They don’t take normal insurance(blue cross), probably because they’re lazy. Makes me appreciate my local small pharmacy who is prompt, friendly, and always in stock. Will never go to Walgreens again.< /Text>

What kind of drug store, especially a Walgreens, doesn’t carry pill supplies? No pill boxes/minders, crushers, trays for counting pills… I thought you guys were a pharmacy? Now I have to drive to another location to get my supplies so I can count out and organize my prescriptions for the week. Thanks a lot Walgreens… You’re useless!<//Text>

Nice dog park. Well behaved dogs. A lot of dirt. Someone complained about the 2 hour parking limit. That is only on school days and in effect until 3 pm. That's because it's near the high school and they don't want students parking there. I've never seen anyone ticketed. Lot can fill up on weekends sometimes but usually not a problem. In the mornings and evenings, you can see hot air balloons in front of the mountains. Nice.< /text>

This playground is fantastic.  The area is gorgeous.  The park and playground is kept up to perfection.  It is very sad and upsetting that the dog owners don't respect the rules on the playground and clean up after their dogs..... especially when the dog playground is right next door.</text>

I love the Boot Barn! Hanna has been there for about 5years or so, she's absolutely awesome!  I met Michelle and They have a new (to me) Hanna too. They are a great team and the vibe makes you feel welcome. Thank you so very much! I can depend on them having exactly what I'm looking for, high Quality products. I love the belts, jeans and omg the boots are the cutest ever... almost forgot about the adorable purses😍 I recommend you stop in and check it all out. 😇🤩< /Text>

They are extremely helpful there. They provided all of the clearance information while walking about. Explained boots and how to properly size. Both the women working this morning managed a decent amount of folks, while upholding personal service for each guest. I was able to accomplish my shopping for everyone. A baby shower, my son, my husband and myself. Can't get any better being besides Starbucks.< /Review>

The staff are very helpful, friendly, and courteous. Boot Barn has a wide variety of everything and a greater selection of work clothing/accessories for women than any other store I have been to. I'm sorry I hadn't shopped there sooner. My first visit was for work however, I will definitely shop there again in the near future. Keep up the good work Boot Barn!!</text>

The staff here was super friendly and helpful. We came here looking for work boots for my husband. He needs a certain type because of his work environment and the staff was knowledgeable and very friendly. They had clean, thick socks for him to use while trying on the boots. We left happy with the purchase and will return when it is time to purchase another pair.<//review>

I went in looking for a pair of women's cowgirl boots and walked with a pair that fit me perfectly. I tried on four pairs of boots. This happened very easily; if it weren't for the salesman that offered me advise and educated me about the different style and types of boots I might have not purchased any!!! Thank you Spencer Scruggs. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Looking forward to shopping there again and again.</Review>

If I could give Boot Barn zero stars I would. I imagine if you go in to the store in person the experience is different but the online experiences was horrible.

I tried to make an order that kept blanking out, stalling and refreshing. I put my information in exhaustively but never received any confirmation or anything.

No second page. No confirmation number. No email. No nothing.

Then it started saying that the card was declined and to call customer service to provide them additional information.

I checked my account and they had put two charge holds on my card for the order that never went through. (Amounting in over $1,000).

I contacted them immediately and they took more than a day to respond. When they responded they did not address my issues at all. They completely ignored my concerns and were telling me to put in another order when I explained that 1. The online form was not working and 2. their numerous card holds would overdraw my account and that because of that there was no way for me to complete another order I.e. the resulting card declined issue. Again they ignored what I had to say.

Then suddenly the card holds are gone and they tell me the address information was incorrect and to update it, re enter all my information, and re check out.

I try that and the same thing happens. I contact them again...

They say that they have no record of an order and that they have not charged me. They make excuses and beat Atkins the bush regarding why my account was charged twice if nothing went through. They tell me there is no order and I will have to call them to complete it.

I decide to drop it and spend my money elsewhere.

Then a day later they send me an email telling me they are going to ship my order. I’m like, “what order”? Nothing ever went through. I was told they did not charge me and that the address was incorrect even though I triple checked my address and all other information the trillion times I entered it.

I tell them I don’t want the order and that I no longer have the funds available for the order because I have spent it elsewhere.

They take two days to reply to me and when they do they say it’s too late, they have already shipped then order.

What order!!????!!!! I haven’t received an order confirmation. I havent received an order number. I haven’t received shipping or teaching info. I told them to drop it and now they’re saying I suddenly, magically, have an order on its way? I am adamant that I do not want whatever order they are talking about and reiterated that I have but revived all of the above. I repeat that I do not have the funds available and that my account will overdraw if whatever they claim to have shipped goes through. (However they won’t provide me with any details on what they are shipping or any information regarding it). They basically skirt around everything

They don’t reply to me for yet another day. When thy finally respond they said I can return it and that that’ll be “happy to help with the return process.”  Then they didn’t respond after that.

If the return process is even one fourth as difficult as this situation I know it will never work out. I’ll probably get charged return fees too.

I feel like I have been scammed or that their site was hacked. But i’m feeling like they just really don’t care about their customers.

The delay and lack of response. Repeatedly is unacceptable.

This whole situation is resulting in overdraft, overdraft fees, and cancellation fees. And I seriously doubt I will ever receive anything from them since they claimed they didn’t have an accurate address to ship to...

I wish I had never heard of Boot Barn and never tried to place an order. Much unneeded stress and hardship for something really not worth it.<//review>

This is where to go in Sonoma county if you're looking for western wear, from belt buckles and clothes to hats and boots. They carry most sizes, children's, men's, women's. They also sell leather care products.</review>

<Name>alarik wood</Name><review>I went to this Boot Barn and Jose is a terrific salesman/manager. José is very polite and will address all your needs/concerns.  The sales on Cinch, Roper and Wrangler George Strait shirts was fabulous.  The boots and other great merchandise, are priced very fair, and of great quality.  This store also is a comfortable environment with no pressure sales. The best Boot Barn location I have ever visited. This is how an efficient business attracts a lot of repeat sales. They have my future business. ...and I wear a LOT of western wear! Thank you José< /review></record></dataset><record>

Dan Panduro is a man of honor and stands behind the CarStar guarantee/warranty.  He and his staff fixed all the issues mentioned below and I couldn't be happier. I received five (5) star service which is the reason for the update and the star rating. If you take your car here and you have a problem and you can't get it resolved at the shop call Dan, he will make it right.  Thank you

DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE -
My first mistake was bringing my car here for body work, my second mistake was taking the rental car back before checking over my vehicle. If you have a rental car go to carstar first and check over your vehicle before returning the rental. If problems exist at least you won't be left without a vehicle.
Not listed in any special order but after they took my car apart they didn't know how to put it back together properly. See photos - they put the rear bumper back on but they didn't attach it, so it's loose. They took off the tailgate/door, when they put it back on they didn't align it properly so one side has a wide Gap in the other side has no Gap. They left gunk in the rear passenger window, when I put it down and put it back up it's just a big black streak. They didn't put the passenger door handles on properly, when I opened the door the handle fell off. The front passenger door squeaks like a cricket in summertime. The wind guard on the front passenger door fell off almost immediately after leaving. I went back and told Eddie about these things he seemed genuinely disinterested. I asked him why they touched the front passenger door and he said so they can match the paint to the rear door, I wish they hadn't touched either door. I filled out the carstar survey - I never heard anything back from them either. I did share this information and the photos with my insurance company.< /Review>< gmapID>

< review>
I recently got into a minor collision that dented my front fender and prevented my driver side door form opening properly, Carstar was one of the shops recommended by the insurance company taking responsibility for it and, after reading reviews, went in. I dropped my car off on a Monday, via text was notified the same day that I would have it back the following Monday but was presently surprised when I picked it up only 3 days later on Thursday. They were ahead of schedule and their work is flawless, they went above and beyond with the repair and my car looks brand new. They did inform me that one small piece (not structural, just cosmetic) would be on back-order for 3 weeks, but even then I have my car and a promise of a call once it's in so they can install it for me in a couple minutes. I will be returning if I have any more damage and I recommend the shop to anyone.< /review>

Beyond professional and super communicative, they got my car back to me both earlier than expected and about $300 under the estimate. Gabby and Matthew did a great job taking care of me and will definitely see me again for anything I need taken of for my car in the future.</text>

Sincerely grateful to Matthew Z. and the front desk manager from Carstar. I arrived in LA to drive a Honda CRV back to the east coast tomorrow.  The glove compartment broke and would not open. Tried Ocean Honda Service Department and they were not helpful- they would only break into the compartment leaving me with a mess.
I was driving past Carstar and decided to ask for a recommendation. The company was clean, well kept and following all COVID 19 protocols.
Matthew assessed the situation and was able to remove two screws and removed the glove compartment, the contents, and reinstalled.  Now happily driving cross country with the manual and registration in hand.
Thank you very much!

Incredibly nice staff and great service. They worked very hard to make sure I was happy and were very honest about labor/pricing. Would highly recommend! My issue was resolved very fast and the damage to my car was dealt with. If I ever get in another accident or damage my car (I hope not) I will take it back here in a heartbeat.</Review>

Eddie and Renay at Carstar absolutely saved me time, money, and peace of mind. After my car kept overheating, I knew I had a coolant leak. I was able to setup an appointment for the next day, and my car was diagnosed and fixed with super speed. Eddie even went out of his way to pick up the needed part for my car, rather than having me come back later after it had been delivered. They didn't try to upsell me, they kept me updated throughout the process, and the pricing and choices were very transparent. As a side note, they even have comfortable waiting areas (and safe for COVID-19). Can't recommend Carstar more highly!< /text>

My car had a couple dents and some scratches on the right door.  I was recommended to Carstar Sun Valley by a friend. Johnny and Peter were the guys who took care of my car for me. They were very courteous and professional.

<review>I was involved in an auto accident and took my car here for repair. At first everything went “ok” Gaby was helpful when I initially went in. After I dropped off my car they lacked communication with me. The fallout with Carstar was when I went to pick up my car. There was a scratch on my car that was very visible! (previously wasn’t there, opposite side of where the damage was done) Manager I believe his name was Eddie came out and told me the wrap on my car “wasn’t done right” I told him I didn’t need his opinion I simply need for him to take accountability for the damage that was done on my. He kept going back and forth with me giving his opinion of how the wrap on my car was instead of apologizing and accepting responsibility. He is very rude and hardheaded never going here again poor customer service ! Please go somewhere else I went in thinking my car would get fixed and I picked it up with other damages and they were still very rude !PLEASE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE !<//review>< Pics>

My car was hit, my insurance recommended Carstar. They called me less then two later letting me know when I could bring my car in. I made appointment which took about 20 minutes for the person to survey my car of damage and any others things just to make sure. I got the estimated in a timely manner on cost and approximately when I be getting my car back. They texted, when you get the parts in, when they fixing, any other issues and any other recommendation before continuing. I appreciated all the text message which was helpful. But they kept in shop free of charge until the following week. The repairs took 2 weeks in half. Which sounds reasonable since there’s a holiday, know they are closed during the weekends. The car came out good, bumper look amazing and  hood had a new fresh paint matching the rest of car. They said they put a gloss on frame which is maid of plastic. They didn’t a horrible job on it. They said they tried matching the front bumper. I feel they should left alone. I paid my deductible, but two hour later my insurance called saying that they called few days back saying that I didn’t need to pay my deductible and they send a letter to carstar letting know that I didn’t need to pay. The owner never mention anything to me about it. The insurance called carstar and let them know to hand back the money. This is something I didn’t understand why owner didn’t say anything about letter. I didn’t like that dishonesty on his part, I called back he said that sometimes insurance never communicate on when they get paid. He did returned the money. The issues was, that they insist that you leave a review on there google. I haven’t wrote review until I give few weeks to test the final product and work done on car. I did like that they keep texting, calling, and I just got a text by gabby 4/14/20 2:35am asking me to leave a review. I really feel annoyed over a text that early in morning.< /review>

They do good work at a fair price. This alone deserves at least 3 stars. I've been coming here for years and will continue to come. Having said all that, I am giving them a passing grade of 3 stars this time. The problem they have is that their mechanics are too busy and often times you can pull into their entrance and wait next to your car for awhile and no one would come talk to you. This happened to me today so I walked to the other side which I thought was their "front desk" or "receptionlist" area. I did get to talk to the personel there right away, but the guy clearly didn't have much interest or patience to talk to us or to listen to what we wanted to do. At the end of the day, I got most of the work done but one of the things I really wanted to do was not even mentioned in the work order....< /review>

<Text>Fix Auto Sun Valley did the fixes to my car quicker than I was originally told and everything has been fixed back to the way it was. They keep you updated as they do the work. Everyone was really nice. And you can grab a free coke or bottle of water while you wait. :) They did a great job. Highly recommend!</Text>< time>

So drivers in L.A. are crazy as anyone knows who lives here. Twice I've had people hit me and had to have repairs.  I picked Fix Auto Sun Valley to do the work the first time and was treated like royalty.  They arranged for Enterprise to bring me to the rental car office, sent regular texts to update me on the status of the repair and were HAPPY AND ENGAGED with me the customer.  (A refreshing quality in customer service these days.) Plus once the car was done, I could leave my rental with them. But most importantly, the quality of the work was EXCELLENT. So I picked them again when I needed another repair and they did not disappoint.  They are so good, I went ahead and replaced my passenger side mirror which was still quasi functional. I did it because I TRUSTED THEM to give me a competitive price and do an excellent repair.  They communicate well, are happy people and do great work - truly what more could you want?< /Text>

Fix Auto Sun valley is hands down the best auto shop in the valley! I have never experienced such an easy non stressful and quick fix to my car. I am currently in my masters, and my car broke down on me during finals!!!  Already stressful as is, the amazing staff took time to wait around after closing time just so I can get my car towed. The car was fixed and returned to me very fast and  clean. The prices are amazing and the staff are amazing ! I most definitely am making this my go to auto shop and you should too!</Review>

My wife and I used Fix Auto Sun Valley because they were referred by the insurance company we were going through. We were a little apprehensive because we had never used them before, but they didn’t disappoint. Even though we were frustrated by the situation of having to get our car repaired to begin with, they were always so nice, professional, responsive, and they kept us up to date on the progress of our car. The results are exceptional. Our car was done quickly, and ahead of schedule even, and the repairs look great. The fact that they worked directly with the insurance company regarding cost/funding and completion status was super convenient. I really appreciate the high quality work and professionalism.<//text>

Giant kudos to the crew at CarStar Sun Valley!  My car was smacked by a grocery delivery truck and needed good inspection and repair.  Added stress was that the accident happened in Mexico just as we were leaving from our vacation there and so wanted to get it fixed here in the U.S.

No problem for the CarStar folks. Gabby Quezada walked me through the process and paperwork with her professional and compassionate demeanor as I dealt with two Mexican insurance companies and an international claim company.  Any questions I had I could just call her.

Matthew Zamacona is the estimator who also worked with the insurance companies and made sure that every detail was perfect and to my satisfaction before I drove away.

Eddie Soto is the general manager who oversees this fabulous operation and who threw in a fix for an ugly scratch as part of the deal.  Always smiling, always ready to help, he was the final fixer for one last detail as I left the premises yesterday.

This is the second time I’ve used CarStar, the first being the fix of a bumper that was a hit and run.  They heated and restored it for $800 less than the insurance replacement would have cost.

It was most reassuring that I could just leave the car there and know that it would be fixed right, quickly, and with great professionalism. I highly recommend them!<//Text>

Robinson is the guy you want in your corner. He is as honest a mechanic as you will find. He has told me numerous times that certain repairs were unnecessary or that I could wait another 10 thousand more miles to fix something, etc. In other words, Waylon knows your not made of money, and he respects that. He's been so good to me over the past few years, and I'm really grateful to have him as a resource, especially since my Matrix has 220k miles on it. Thank you Waylon! I'd never go anywhere else.< /review>

<user_name>Sam In California<//user_name><Review>My experience at FIX Auto in Sun Valley exceeded my expectations.  First and foremost, my Chevy Volt was repaired beautifully.  I can’t tell where the front end damage was.  The paint was matched perfectly, and my particular paint had a difficult green to grey pearl prism color!
Second, they updated me daily with text messages and phone calls.  They interfaced with Geico Insurance with ease and professionalism.  Marty was wonderful!  My hat goes off to Mr. Gonzales who did part the repair work, and also a big
THANK YOU to the rest of the staff.

<user_id>113414790676550011822<//user_id><pics>None<//pics><Review>I recommend NEVER take your car to Fix Auto Sun Valley or check your The vehicle before you leave!! My car was in an accident on February 1st 2018. I was told the was wear and tear because it has been a little over a year! That’s why they are not paying for it l. “It pass the alignment” they claim. This is what hold my wheel in place. Is this look like water and tear??? I took it back to them told them I felt some type of vibration about I believe a little over a month or almost a month when I got the car back after they claimed they fixed. I believe March They still did not fix the problems after I told them the problem. I could have been dead or seriously injured from them making a mistake, a BIG mistakes!! So tell me How Is this wear and tear? Took them  about a whole day to get back to me. My insurance geico wasn’t going to pay for it because they and Fix Auto Sun Valley feel and came to the conclusion that this is wear and tear!! It was cause by a pot hole or something I have run over on the road. This is what they believe and their conclusion. It on the same side of where the person hit me from. I had to pay for the part and me and my dad installed it on.

Thank you Fix Auto Sun Valley for doing a poor job, not doing your job and making sure everything was fixed!! The part was fracture do to the accident and it had finally snapped in half! I am very disappointed with your business I will not be recommending anyone to y’all at all!

P.S I post the picture on their Facebook page</Review>< Rating>

The people are really nice they explain everything and the best thing  is that they are honest and do a really good job. And honestly they will leave the car better than when you buy it from the dealer. My wife, me, my cousin and my uncle have always brought there car here. We recommend this place to anyone that want honest people  a good quality work.< /review>

<Text>Do not Go Here!!! Poor quality workmanship belittled my Mustang 2017 race red vehicle at just another fully built American car. Cat adjuster from Mercury come out and evaluate the poor repairs ever made. He came out gave instructions to fix it auto to repair it correctly once again shamefully the vehicle came out more poor than initially brought. I believe the Mercury adjuster and the Proprietors of this location have something going on why wasn't my vehicle repaired correctly.. do not take your vehicle here poorly mismanaged low-quality</Text><username>emilio garcia<//username><GmapID>0x80c294351452b4bb:0xcf9fb0e1b052f07c</GmapID>< Response>

My insurance Geico had referred tHis body shop first time I got hit. Gabby was very friendly, very professional, very informative. Did a great job repairing my car on time not lagging even though it was holiday time, few days into Christmas day.... Second time got hit big time , told the adjuster to have my car tow to Fix Auto. Gabby was again very courteous, professional... I  recommend Fix Auto to eveeyone!< /review>

Update: the owner response is total BS. I didn't yell at her staff. I was firm with them but I did not yell or call anyone any names or swear at them.  I had a legitimate issue with after picking up my car and they didn't want to take responsibility for it.

I told them I'll pay for the rental but I'm giving a bad review and I don't give bad reviews for no reason. That's when the owner jumped in and started accusing me of not maintaining my car and so forth and she didn't even know what car was mine or what happened. She told me it's not their job to let you know if something is wrong with your car uhhhhhh.

Maybe she doesn't realize that threatening a bad review is the only way to get a shady company to act right. That is the case here. I give good reviews when they are warranted and I don't give bad reviews for minor things.

The owner only cares about herself and her business but not the customer. She is immature and will argue with you even when she doesn't know the details of your car. THEY screwed up and then LIED, and then tried to blame it on me and talk down to me.

I brought my car here because it was recommended by Geico. Everything went smoothly at first but when I got my car back the brakes we're having were having issues. So I brought the car back and they gave me a rental car and told me they need to keep it for the night. they called me and said that my brakes were down to the metal and that was causing the issue so we agreed that I will pay to get my brakes done as long as they make sure that they are okay. Even though there was no issue when I dropped the car off. I knew they were getting low so I decided to let them fix it.

So I get the car back and they said I have to pay for the rental car and I said no way. they gave me the car back when it wasn't even ready they didn't test drive it properly and I had to bring it back and deal with the hassle. They didn't reinstall my brakes properly after they replaced the rear axle. Then they want to try to blame it on me and say that I'm lying and dont maintain my car and charge me.

I agreed to give them a 5 star review if they just pay for the rental like they said they would. I can't say they were good because they weren't. They screwed up and instead of making it right they blamed it on me and I had to fight to get them to pay for 1 day of a rental car.

The owner jumped into the conversation without even knowing which car was mine or what happened. She treated me like garbage and completely disrespected me and accused me of trying to get something for free.

The mechanic tried to reason with me and was more logical than the owner and he agreed that they would pay for the rental. I appreciated that but he said my brakes were down the the metal and it just wasn't true. He said they drove it and they wouldn't let the car leave like that but the fact is they said it was ready before really checking it because the brakes had a clear issue that I noticed immediately when picking it up.

At the end I requested the old pads back and they truly were lying. One side was pretty low but in no way was it down to the metal. BS. But go ahead and have your 5 stars Fix Auto.< /text>

< Review>
Great quality work, honest, 10/ 10 star  is what Fix Auto Sun Valley is !

Other body shops are trapped in enclosed warehouse, where Fix Auto have open space and cleaner air and less dust, well organized, and the location is convenient.
Big chain shops are too big to care about customers where fix Auto Sun Valley provide the service unlike many shops, they cares about people.

Quality -
Daniel the owner cares about his customers, he personally and his team go through every steps in the repair process with us and keep us well informed and updated.
Mel in the team repaired our car made sure the paint was great and it was same as manufacturer quality, they did an excellent job!
They are very detail and kept the car clean ! I like their detail department cleans the car inside out ! The exterior shines and they use great cleaner to clean the interior of the car.

Honesty -
I read reviews for other shops and there are many shops that belongings inside the car got missing after the repair, Fix auto kept all of the belongings inside the car and when i get it back all things were there.

I am very happy with them and highly recommended this body shop, it has unparalleled service !  Many expensive cars lined up for repairs, If you are looking for a body shop, see what they offer yourself !!< /Review>

<review>I got hit on the driverside door. My insurance company told me I could come here and get my insurance inspection, estimate and rental car all in one place.*  It took almost an hour between inspection and when I could leave to pick up my rental. (that's right, Gieco lied to me. You can only get a rental at the site if you have rental insurance, not if you are paying out of pocket) I don't think it needed to take an hour either way, but if that had been the only problem I'd be leaving a 5 star review. Finally, they let me know my car would be ready at 5:15 on a Tuesday night. I can't get there Tuesday that late so I come at lunch the next day. That takes about 1/2 an hour of her calling for my car 3 different times before they bring it up. It was FILTHY. I don't mean a little dusty,  mean it looked like someone dumped a bag of fine sawdust over the whole thing. Again, if that had been the only thing, not that big a deal.  But, on my way home there is a strange sound. I get out to look, they didn't put my front end back together right and the plastic wheel covering is rubbing on he tire. I had to  use plastic ties to secure it. I would have done it the proper way but,  I am not pretending I know how to disassemble a car and reassemble it like this, not going to repair your car shop, does.  Also, the front panel is no longer flush to the rest of the car.  In addition, I found two unused parts in my back seat that I was charged for but they either didn't need or forgot they needed while repairing my car blindfolded. This place could have only done a worse job if my door fell off.  Also, Geico signed off on these "repairs." Both businesses are an insult to those who pay them.  This is a great place to bring your car, only if you want it destroyed.< /review>< user_name>

No customer respect. Had a 9AM appointment and because of a freight train and traffic arrived 10 minutes late. I was asked to sit down and wait, got a cup of coffee, spent about 12 minutes hanging out and then the guy who told me to have a seat came back in and said I would have to reschedule. Well what I did not realize, was that the person who was supposed to be handling the Geico accounts was on the phone... he was on the phone the whole time I was there. Something about it left me really upset, like his time was more important than mine. Sorry Geico, can't deal with this kind of customer service! By the way I was only 10 minutes late and I did not "curse" as stated in the response, but I did ask "if I was in a docter's office."< /Text>

<resp>{'time': 1510186738886, 'text': "Dear customer, the Geico representative in the office is an employee of Geico and as such, owns the scheduling effectively taking it out of the shop's hands. Normally if you are within 5 mins of your appointment time, they do their best to accommodate you. Appointments are set in 30 minute increments so if you are 15 minutes late, as was your case, you will not be given the necessary attention and will therefore be asked to reschedule. On this occasion, you were also offered the option to return at a later time at 10:30 thereby avoiding the need to reschedule. In LA traffic is a way of life and we all do our best to solve issues. Respect is earned and easily lost when profanity is introduced into the conversation. Even when you did curse, the staff remained professional and did not respond in kind. This one star review would be effectively handled by sending it directly to Geico and rationally discussing the matter. We are not one and the same entity but will pass along your sentiments. You will receive an opportunity to  submit your review directly to Geico through their survey program. Your one star review on this page affects the livelihood of all employees and their ability to feed their families. I invite you to carefully reconsider the next time you take the time to blast a business in public."}</resp><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>1< /Rate><user_name>Levon</user_name></record>

{'time': 1559066733081, 'text': "Good morning Rose, my apologies for my delayed response to your review.  I generally will reply to a review within a few days but this one required me to do some research.  It's important for me to take what our customers say extremely serious especially when theft is part of the subject matter. I must say that I was more than surprised to receive this review simply because it's the first time in the 15 years that I've overseen our family business that we've been accused of stealing any item from a customers vehicle.  That being said, as painful as it was to do, I interviewed all 14 of our loyal teammates and reviewed several hours of surveillance video and was not able to confirm at what point any item(s) were removed from your vehicle.  I'm sorry that I was not able to confirm these wrongdoings and I do hope that you were able to locate the items that were misplaced.  If my team or I can do anything further to help you, please feel free to contact the office and ask for me directly or one of my trusted teammates and we will do what we can to extend a helping hand.  Thank you"}< /resp>

< Review>
This has been one of my favorite parks since moving to the Walteria neighborhood in 2011. I've been to a lot of parks and even my pup knows when we're almost near the park. He can be in a dead sleep and all of a sudden he'll jump up and go put his head out the window. He only does that for one other park and the beach lol. 🐶🐕🐾🌲🌴🌾🌳😍</Review>

Nice park, quiet neighborhood and cool playground. Also good for parties... Can get a little sketchy at night as there's some homeless that like to hang out there but during the day it's awesome....<//Text>

I am from out of town. I brought four boys to play; ages 2,4,5, and 7. They enjoyed the playground and I enjoyed that it was clean and enclosed on three sides. There were plenty of benches and a shelter with picnic tables. Great neighborhood park!< /Review>

<text>I love this park. It's big with plenty of room to find your own space. It's dog friendly, kid friendly and adult friendly. There's a play area for the kiddos, plenty of grass area for your dog. Basketball, handball and tennis courts with a workout area. Cook out BBQ pits and tables and a bonfire pit. The trees are big and beautiful with plenty of shade and the best breeze ever for those super hot days.</text><user>115953522392419972748<//user><Pics>None<//Pics>< Time>

Good park, lots of grass and great for kids. I used to love it here. Key word- USED. The park is still in good conditions, with a McDonalds near by, but there are to many mentally ill people or homeless guys. There is a lot of cursing, and weird things being said. I drove past their once, and saw a guy with only his undies on. So, to sum it up, DON'T GO HERE!!!< /review>

Showed up for a crochet/ sewing class as posted on "Meetup"  and I was straight - stood up!.... Never been so insulted! I had the twins and they gave the jungle gym area a 5 for the balancing pods. They also have good inclines for fun scooter riding.< /review>

all the children pouring sand in them..there should be some kind of note posted for children not to do this since the parents are too busy on their phones to even notice or even care.....I really hope to see some improvement soon, because Walteria is a beautiful park  it just needs to be kept up to day!!<//Review></record>

<review>I like that Park itself had a beautiful room where they did crafts and stuff however not good for bringing a classroom or a daycare for the day a few homeless people hang out there which is fine they don't bother anybody but it makes people feel very uncomfortable when you bring their children in that environment so the park itself is beautiful</review>< pictures>

We were charged for a cleaning fee for something that WAS NOT there when we returned our car, and worse over they wouldn’t provide us photographs of the supposed spill from before our rental and the one that was shown to us WAS NOT date stamped and was printed in such poor quality you could hardly make anything out! Why didn’t customer service email the photos to us like they said they would two of the THREE times we had to reach out to them?? Considering we had to request a different vehicle upon arriving because the one we booked smelled like cigarettes, you would think someone was checking the cars before releasing them to new renters... with no one to check us in and out this is without doubt the worst experience we’ve had renting a car in any state or from any company. I suggest everyone steer clear or be VERY careful if you must book via Payless.</review><user>112496916164966901916<//user></record></dataset><record>

HORRIBLE SERVICE! Beware of this company. You're better off paying a little more and going with a more reputable rental company. The cars are dirty and disgusting. They didn't have the car available that we wanted even though we paid for a full size SUV. Also the first car they gave us reeked of cigarettes. Payless is shady and charges their customers cleaning fees without proof of damage. I was charged a $250 cleaning fee. There was supposedly a stain they could not show proof of. Customer service was a nightmare! We requested the photos multiple times and they never emailed them. We finally went in person and the manager said he'd knock off $150 and we would see the credit in 7-10 days but it never happened. Scammers!!!! I have yet to call them them because I always get the ring around. DO NOT use Payless.<//Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><date>1615392160322</date><Review>The wait to get our car was longer than anticipated. When we finally got to our car it was nowhere close to similar to the style car that we were expecting (we had booked a Toyota 4Runner or similar and we received a Mitsubishi Outlander). The car reeked of cigarette smoke and had mud and dirt smeared across the ceiling of the car. It did not look like it had even attempted to be cleaned before we got it. We were in a hurry to get to a meeting and were already late since it took so long to get the car that we had no time to go back in and try to get a different car. I will never rent with this company again!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Beware..  no one at Payless counter. After looking around and waiting for quite some time for a customer service rep to allow us to pick up our car, a worker from another company informed us that you have to pick up the car with Avis. There should be a sign on the counter or something in the reservation about this. Can you actually think about and be considerate of your customers time? Just a simple sign letting customers know.  That is really not hard to do.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<text>There was no clerk at the Payless car rental desk. I had to wait in a long line. The line serve all Budget, Avis and Payless car rental. Then the Budget car rental clerk came out and served their customers. After Budget called their clients from the main line, I became second in line to be served.< /text>< username>

I greatly appreciate the pricing for the rental and it was even sweeter that i did not have to go through Expedia,Priceline or any other discount service in order to get a good deal.I recently rented from a few of your competitors but in order to get a decent deal you must go through a discount service which means the billing can be confusing. I like dealing with one rental company when spending my money.<//Text>

Currently standing in line for about 30 minutes.  One employee working who is extremely slow.  She then let someone cut which has made this whole process even longer.  Every other car rental place is moving their line quickly.  I don't recommend.</Text>

Car wasn't thoroughly cleaned beforehand but it wasn't anything terrible. That's honestly the only bad thing I have to say. Customer service was great. In and out very quickly. Fees and price were exactly what was quoted online and when I called to extend my rental it was a very easy process. Would definitely use them again and would recommend to others.</Text>

BE WARE!!
I am glad I read all of the reviews before actually picking up the car.  I made a reservation and noticed in the restrictions that I had to let the counter know if I was leaving the state.  I was curious as to what that might mean or why it would matter.
I sent the customer service an email letting them know I was heading out of state and see if I would incur any additional charges for doing so.  Throughout 5 emails the lady (Destiny) kept beating around the bush saying I "probably wouldn't" be charged if I took the car out of state, but there was no way to know until I got to the counter.
Destiny stated "however due to the fact we are not at the counter and they are run off different systems, we do not see what they see nor with all the charges that can/ cannot be added on when a contract is opened. Mileage is unlimited. If you are just driving to Colorado and back to California, then you should be fine. "
I was still skeptical so I called the customer service to actually talk to someone, and Frank, whom I talked to, seemed to have a very clear understanding that I would be charged 25 cents per mile outside of the state, and the car had a GPS which would track miles, and then I would receive a bill!
Now...it seems if Frank knows that this is a clear rule, I am not sure why Destiny would not have told me that the numerous times I asked her if there were any reasons I would be charged.
Either Frank is wrong with his answer, or Destiny didn't know, in which case she should have found out. Or Destiny knew, and was trying to scam me out of money, which is what I have read from numerous people here!
Either way, I canceled this reservation s fast as I could, and decided to spend the extra $30 on a more reputable rental company!< /text>

<text>FRAUD and THEFT!  Do not rent from Payless Car Rental.  They gave me a beat-up beater with dents and scratches, an engine that stalled, stuttered and barely ran, and a front air dam that was dragging on the pavement.  I informed the agent I would be returning before they opened.  She said it was "No problem."  I returned the car at 4:00 am Sunday morning, following the agent's instructions, but Payless said I returned it "late Monday evening."  They charged me for an extra day, and added a late fee for the extra day.  I provided Payless my airline ticket, showing I flew out of California early Sunday morning, and receipt of a purchase at the Utah airport after the flight landed.  Payless said those things did not prove I returned the car before I left California.  This was not a "clerical error," it's malicious, purposeful fraud and theft.  Fortunately, my credit card company disallowed the illegal charges.  Do not rent from Payless!</text><UserId.>106941761602960636686< /UserId.></record>

Nice people I came across.  Don't smoke outside/besides of your car if you don't wanna get charged for smoking inside you car. Smoke may go in and you may get charged if smoke gets inside and your car smells.  Good clean cars.< /review>

The guy at the counter asked if I wanted any of the "extra services" and I said a very definitive "NO," as insurance is already covered by my credit card.  I got to the car with my daughter & realized he had charged me (a lot!)  for unwanted car insurance & something called "sickness insurance" -- like if the car gets the plague?  Seriously.  So I promptly called them to correct the mistake but kept getting bumped to their national number, which claimed they couldn't help me.  When I returned the car, they were very hostile & said I must've asked for the insurance, and refused to remove it.  SO, if you use them READ the paper before signing anything.  They are sleazy & shady, but you can be smarter than I was ;)<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<rate>2< /rate><text>My car was in the shop and I needed a replacement for a few days. I booked online for pickup at 8pm. I got there a bit late and they were closed - I was not notified that they close at 8.  My fault for not looking, but frustrated because I could have gotten there earlier if I knew.  I came back the next morning and they could not find my reservation. Once located, they needed current proof of insurance, again if I had known, I could have come prepared.  I located my insurance on my phone, but they needed a hard copy.  I had to call my agent to fax to them.  Then they needed TWO forms of ID that showed my current address.  My license was not enough, so my insurance agent faxed a current bill to them as well. Then, they needed to place a $500 hold on my card for security if I don't buy their insurance - but I just showed them that I have current insurance.  When they told me the car I reserved was no longer available and I had to get a more expensive vehicle, I started to leave.  Another employee said they could honor my online quote and we closed the deal.  The person was nice enough, the car was fine and the price was good, but I had to fight to get the rate originally quoted online plus a $500 hold on my credit card. Their policies should be disclosed up front.  Buyer beware.</text>< pics>

I have been renting from Payless for more than 5 years. It's my go-to car rental several times each year. I have never had a negative experience with them, and have always had friendly customer service - always! It's not because I'm recognized as a regular customer either (their system doesn't show me as such, apparently) so the consistency with great and patient customer service is even more impressive!<//text>

They will literally rob you.  My receipt says 160 dollars (for two days) but they charged me for 250.  No receipt, nothing.  I called customer service, I called the location, just to get a receipt.  Turns out they charged me 80 dollars for fuel.  They gave the vehicle to me on empty, I returned it at half, told them about it and I quote "We will not charge you for the fuel".  Several phone calls and emails unanswered.  This transaction was deceitful and negligent, I would avoid renting from here again. 35 dollar a day rental cost me 250 dollars for two days. False fuel charges in addition to tons of other misc charges I never agreed to.  Please learn from my mistake and avoid using this rental company, you will not save any money and they will definitely waste your time.<//Review>

We received a very good price to rent a car at Payless in Oakland at the airport.  The Customer Services Representative was very helpful, knowledgeable and pleasant.  Payless has a great program if you have AARP you can get a free upgrade on the automobile rental if a vehicle is available and in our case it was!  It was a quick process to rent and return.  We will definitely use Payless the next time we are in Oakland!<//text>

We are Oakland residents and needed a rental for our family vacation. The car I picked up had a smoke odor but I was in a hurry so I noted it clearly on the contract AND told Jamie as I left the lot. She assured me there was no problem as long as I made a note of it.

As my husband started to drive the car more the odor intensified and was really overpowering. We noticed there was also a cigarette burn in the upholstery of the driver’s seat! We were relieved to return the car and be done with it.

The insult to injury came about a month later when a letter arrived with the information that Payless had charged our credit card $275 for smoke damage! It felt like such a betrayal and I regret trusting the company with my credit card!

I followed their customer complaint process through their messaging system and they were obtuse, obstructive and refused to refund the charge. The person I messaged with refused to escalate to a manager, writing that the manager would contact me if he or she felt like it!

I got through to the people who work at the rental facility near the Oakland Airport. One person said she would locate the contract for me but then called to say I would need to escalate to a manager there. Very frustrating! When I look at other reviews it seems to be a pattern with Payless Car Rental here in Oakland to add fraudulent charges after the fact.

Beware! Do not share your credit card with them!

Update: I see the management keeps offering a phone number for defrauded customers to call. I have wasted too much time on the phone already trying to recover the fraudulent $275 charge from this company. I am reporting to the Better Business Bureau and sending a letter to the CEO of Payless.< /review>

<review>When we arrived the staff was very friendly.  The car we rented was very clean and accommodating to our needs.  The process was very easy and the price was great.  I would recommend this company.  The only negative I could say is that when we were returning our car, there were no instructions as to what to do with our keys, listed anywhere.  We went early in the morning so there weren't any staff members present.  We found out by accident that you can leave your keys with the shuttle driver and they will return them for you.  But overall, very pleasant experience with this company.<//review>< Pics>

I am not one to write online reviews, but I have to make an exception in this instance. After reading all of the reviews on here about Payless Car Rental at OAK, I felt someone had to tell the truth. First of all, it IS located at the rental car center. No $10 bus ride required; just the same shuttle for all the other companies. The reviews who claim otherwise are lying. Second, when I reviewed my final charges after returning home, I was actually charged LESS than what the invoice states. Third, Isabel was pleasant to work with, was helpful and friendly and was no more pushy than any other salesperson in any other business. Fourth, the vehicle I rented was clean and in good condition; in fact better than some I have rented from more expensive companies. Lastly, not only will I rent another vehicle from this location the next time I need one, I will gladly recommend this company and location to any and everyone looking to rent a vehicle in Oakland.

Don't believe all these online reviews. 99.9% of these people are just whiny little Yelpers and bitter wanna-be writers who are no more qualified to write a review than my cat. Check out Payless for yourself. I am very glad I did.<//Review>

<Review>I was over charged for my rental car. My reservation was for $238.98 & they charged me $421.06 once I returned the car. Gas tank topped off, cleaned out and everything so I see no reason why I was over charged $180.00. I've called over and over again speaking with their awful customer service with no answers. They continue to promise it back onto my card & still nothing. Reading these reviews make me so upset I didn't see them before I rented the car. This place is a scam. My family and I can't afford to throw money away with our tight income and this has been a very upsetting awful rental car experience. I've already filed a complaint through their website and have an incident number open and STILL nothing. So bummed. Don't give these people your credit card!<//Review>< Date>

< Review>
Stay away from this company! I arrived at airport on time in OAK, dragged my luggage to their surface booth, only to find out they're already closed. Although so far I was not charged, it's totally unpleasant at late evening. Go for another better brand if you don't want surprises.</Review>

I've rented twice from Payless
And I really must confess
The service & experience
Have been among the best.

Would I return and rent again ?
And would I spread their name ?
An unequivocal YES INDEED
They're worthy of such fame.<//text>

If I could rate this a zero stars I would! Absolutely horrible customer service at this location. I rented a car through this company for the first time. Typically I use Enterprise, at the time they were too expensive. Payless offered a great price to only rent for 3 days. Long story short I had paid a deposit for an underage fee was told I will get this back after I return the car (just like any other car rental company returns the deposit) Get there on the return day the same lady is not working whom told me I could return the deposit to a different card if I wanted to. (Only reason I even remembered about the deposit) The ladies at the counter swiped my card like she knew what she was doing and then stopped because she said it was trying to return more than I was talking about. I told her I didn't want all my money back just what I was told I would get back. Well this particular lady whom helped me out the first time was on vacation so nobody could reach her. She proceeded to tell me to just wait for this lady to get back and I wouldn't have a problem BUT NOT TO CALL CORPORATE CAUSE THEY WOULD TAKE LONGER THEN THE COUPLE OF DAYS SHE WAS OFF TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. So I waited the few days, then when I finally talk to her she tells me something totally different AND HAS THE AUDACITY TO CUSS ME OUT AND HANG UP ON ME! I have called corporate and am now waiting for a resolution on this situation. Corporate actually takes ONLY 24 hours to resolve an issue (why I listened to the people giving me horrible customer service IDK! I guess I am too trusting on people and their word) Nobody could call the manager while I was there to ask her to help with the situation and I was not told any other options. I am a manager myself and I would NEVER treat a customer like this. Especially when you're spending so much money on something.< /Text>

<review>Easy online reservation, and the initially good price kept getting better for a while, so I just made a new reservation.  Staff was friendly, car was clean and in good condition.    Late evening return was a bit confusing, since we had to enter via the Avis/Budget driveway, but we had been forewarned.  I always try to rent from Payless if they're at the airport where we are travelling.<//review><user_id>100908852264155248718< /user_id><resp>None<//resp>< date>

I made my reservation before reading some of the comments...ti say I was apprehensive was an understatement, BUT my service here was impecible!  The 2 ladies working the front desk were very kind and made my experience super easy. I reserved an economy car but was given a larger car. It was in ok condition...not new but not old. It was sufficient for the weekend use.< /Text>

< Review>
I'm writing this review because I was so impressed with the rental counter agent, Jamie.  When my husband and I got there there were a couple people ahead of us, including one person who had just made a reservation online and was waiting for it to show up in the computer. Jamie was working the evening of Tuesday, Feb 17th by herself and was handling it like a pro.  She was VERY calm, professional, and courteous the whole time I was there. One of the customers had been assigned a car but came back when they discovered something they didn't like. Jamie didn't look irritated or put out, she simply re-assigned them another car and sent them out happy campers..  She continued to check the computer periodically to see if the other customer's reservation showed up.  With each customer she was very THOROUGH.  She had the rental agreement MEMORIZED. She knew without looking, exactly where the customer should sign and initial and verbally described each item they had to sign. (I've been renting cars for many, many years and I have NEVER seen that kind of attention to detail and desire for excellence.) Although she had to handle all the customers ALONE, she never lost her composure or pleasant attitude even though there were a few challenges that popped up during the time we were there. Our rental process was smooth and easy.  I wish I had a business where I needed a top-notch employee - of a leadership caliber.  I would STEAL Jamie away from there with financial incentives and employee benefits and perks.  She's the kind of employee that will help to build any business that deals with the public. I am so totally impressed with her that I had to write this review.  If she had been rude and nasty I certainly would have; why not do the same for someone who deserves to hear...You did a great job! Thank you Jamie for your service!<//Review>

Can I give negative stars!? Ugh! They charged me a $250 cleaning fee for "smoking and animal hair". I do NOT smoke, nor did I have an animal in the car. I 100% am not guilty. They said nothing to me when I returned it, then a month later I got a letter saying they were going to charge me. I called to dispute it, and they said they weren't going to charge me. Then I got charged. I opened a case with customer care, and they are refusing to give me the $250 back. Absolute BS!!!!!!</review>

< Review>
Overcharged on fuel even after agreeing to the prepaid (apparently it was my negligence to not see it was not added to the contract just a verbal YES on part) they also added road side insurance that I did not ask for..... all I can say is "buyer beware": READ your contract carefully to ensure you get what you ask for and then double check your final invoice!!

Finally, extremely poor customer service.</Review>

I want to give 0 star but I can't.
Arrived this afternoon and agent told me no car at all. Several customers were waiting there with no idea when they could get one car.
Fortunately, I wrote these bad reviews and booked another car rental at Alamo in a later time and got my car with no problem. Payless sucks really.< /Text>

Please dont be tempted by the lesser rate. My initial receipt for was 60$ and after almost a month they held back  another 75$ without any explanation.

Have been calling the customer care for 3 days and no clear answer from any one. Worst rental car provider in the whole US.<//review>

<Review>I'm not sure how this place is still running? They are scammers! I really wish we would have listened to all the reviews because we ended up being charged an extra 200$. We received a filthy car, returned it early, we even helped an elderly lady start her keyless car at the rental place because the employees were too busy for her..... a week later we notice 200$ had been charged to our card, we contact the company, they told us to call customer service, guess what? NO REFUND! they pulled every trick in the book to not give us our money back (dog hair, late fees, dirty car) which is hilarious since we own a hairless dog, returned it early and in the same condition as we received it, filthy(I'm not here to do your job for you).</Review>< rating>

<text>Do not under any circumstances rent from these people. I had the worst experience ever with this car company. The car was dirty and scraped. After I returned it on time the correct day, the car rental charged me an additional day. I asked for proof of the charges and they were incredibly rude to me. Because I was in the middle of moving I threw out the receipt and now I have no proof that they are charging me too much. Just don't do it.< /text>< Pics>

Pick up was fast. Car was ready since I had reservations already. I checked car for damages, made sure tank was full and was on my way in less than 15 minutes.

I usually rent a car and don't worry about gas receipts, etc but after reading the posts this time after filling I not only got a receipt but I snapped a picture of the receipt, gas tank guage and mileage to be on the safe side.

Drop off was just as quick. Their entrance is a little further down around the corner than the rest so you have to look for it or you'll pass it up. I found it after getting directions. Attendant met me at the car after parking, checked car for damages, gas on full. I went inside and he gave me a drop off turn in receipt and just like that finished in less than 5 minutes. He said the hold on my credit card was released and should see it when my bank releases. I'll be check for sure.

So good experience. I suggest just make sure you reserve prior, check vehicle and mark the paper thoroughly, keep receipts and get receipts, and you'll have no problems.

I didn't give it 5 stars because I wanted to extend one more day and I couldn't get ahold of anyone even during business hours. This was a little inconvenient but I turned it when it was due.

I'm assuming management finally got it together seems like. Will I book with them again? Yes. Great deals lol!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><user_id>114731658418132416466</user_id>< rate>

This has been the worst experience EVER with a car rental place. I turned the car in very early in the morning, there was no one there to accept the car. Now I am having to prove that I do not have possession of the car when I am in DC and I rented in CA.  To make this worse I was on hold for over 2 hours waiting for someone to answer the call.  I ended up calling when I did not receive a receipt and not once did receive an email or phone call from the company asking if I was keeping the car.  This is by far the worst experience, I will NEVER rent from them again and suggest you do not also.</text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>Service was average when I picked up the car--only one person to help the line of many. When we returned the car we were told to leave the keys on the counter, nobody was in line and two employee behind the counter, so we did so and headed to the airport. When I received my charge on the credit card it as for $99.54 more than what I was  given on my itinerary with Travelocity. I called and filed a complaint and was told someone would get back with me within 24-72 hrs. Nothing a week later. I called and disputed the charge w/my credit card company and called Payless back. The complaint ticket no. I was given didn't exist and I had to start over again. I will never use Payless again, and we do a lot of travel and often rent cars. I have never had this happen elsewhere.</review>< resp>

<text>Be warned! Not at the rental car center. You will not only have to take a shuttle from the airport to the rental car center, you will have to take a second one, which in my case left me waiting for over 20 minutes, to their location. When I got there, no one was at the front desk, and after finally soaking with someone, was told that my car, supposedly reserved for an hour ago, is not yet ready.  It's now been 40 minutes since I made it to the rental car center, nearly an hour since I landed, and still no car. Oh, and the office? Filthy.<//text><GmapID>0x808f85a10fd70387:0x2088f7e8df6927eb< /GmapID><user>109134952589885369854<//user></record></dataset><record>

Super dissaqpointed after receiving a bill for $75.00 for carpet cleaning on a vehicle that never had no food or drinks in the car 30 days later.  I will not be using Payless rentacar under any circumstances ever!  Seems to be a common practice as you can see in other reviews.<//review>

If I could I would give this company ZERO stars.  Waited over an HOUR when picking up the car and there were not that many people in line.   2 people ahead of me had to come back in after they were given their assigned cars because the cars were filthy inside.  Have Called customer service 4 times now to try and get a receipt , emailed 3 times and have gotten no response.   I'm told there is No one else I can speak to about getting a receipt and the dept. that handles sending out the receipts is only contactable via there internal email.   in short, I'm not getting a receipt, therefore I cant claim back the charges for the car and am out of pocket for the full amount.  Worst company I have ever dealt with for Car Rental and Only falls slightly below Century Link as worst customer service EVER.< /text>

To avoid if you do not want to pay more than expected :
- Firstly, the place is located off airport that means it is not located like all other rent a car company and you'll need a ride offered by Payless for which you will be charged 10$.
- Secondly the person in charge of the car renting had questionable methods. At first, he billed us a lot of extra costs without telling us. He did not give us the car we ordered even though it was there. He corrected those points when we requested.
I will not go back to Payless.<//review>

<text>rented a car for one day ...when we arrived they didn't have any cars when we had a reservation but the wait was not as long as I thought ..half hour ..we purchased insurance for any damage we walk away for the one night it was $11...we were given a car that had "return to eccles " on two sides of windows in white marker ...one the second day trying to return to the car while on the sidewalk in San Francisco with my husband and 90 year old mother in law we could not get in the car ... the key button NOR key would unlock it ... all I had was a number on the key for roadside assistance ...which I called ..I was treated like a complete moron that I could not open the car ...and was then told we did not purchase roadside assistance so for them to help us they needed a credit card and it would be $59 ....long story short when we got back to then rental place the lady saw the key wouldn't work and apologized and said  we should not have been charged anything and if we were to contact Payless....so of course we we charged $59 roadside assistance ...now the tune was we did not purchase roadside assistance so they couldn't do anything ..to today ..they did not charge us so they can not issue the credit ..the roadside assistance company I called can't do anything because " the work was complete" ...its ridiculous .... so for $59 they will loose a customer and I will be putting a complaint in to the Better Business Bureau ..we could have BROKEN the window and got in the car and they would have had to repair and we pay nothing because we did buy damage insurance but we didn't do that and now all we have gotten is grief to try and get the charge removed ..as the Payless and the roadside assistance now just want to blame each other about who should take off the charge< /text>< user_id>

I'm very unhappy with my experience. I rented a car from the Oakland, California location. My departure was earlier than the 7 A.M. opening time. There is no way to return a vehicle when it's not during business hours. I called customer service and was told this if I didn't return it during business hours, if be charged until I did. Then, the agent hung up on me. I had to change my flight just to return the car. VERY DISSATISFIED.< /text>

<Review>Terrible company. They don't have enough employees working here. People were coming in and complaining about smoke and headlight issues. People came in for reservations made at 1130 and Payless turned them away because they close at 11. Why would you allow someone to make a reservation after you're closed?</Review>< pics>

<text>This business has questionable methods!  I reserved for 7 days and they changed it to 5 days on my contract.  When calling, they said that it must be turned in or there will be a fee.  They told me that they could not extend because of weekend demand.< /text>< pictures>

<text>The dancers seemed like they were about to fall asleep, no energy. They also didn't pay any attention to the few people who tried sitting at the stage. Entry fee is doubled for men ($40) and the smallest size red bull costs $8. Nice interior design though.</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I'm not lying or exaggerating when I say this is the worst place ever.  Extremely over priced and the girls are very pushy. $500 for a private lap dance in the back with"Aspen Pounce" which was supposed to be "25 minutes" but turned into a regular 10 minute lap dance in the back. Don't go here! I've been to a lot of strip clubs in my time but this was by far the worst.< /review>

My friend and I went to this place around 11:30 Saturday night. The entry fee was fair at $20 before midnight. The guy at the counter was nice. But when me and my friend went inside, before we got to sit down, 2-3 women approached us and wanted to give a "tour" because it was my first time in the place.

I get the tour, but then they were pushing harder on wanting me to spend $500 to do 15 minutes (which I didn't even have and was ridiculous). Then trying to pusher harder to do more for $1000 minimum which I was like "no way" in my head. They then push me to the ATM to withdraw. I was able to finally get out by saying no thanks, I want to sit and get use to the place, and I just walked downstairs not stopping.

So we finally sit down and enjoy the show. After awhile, a blonde several times tried to get me to get a lap dance like every 5 minutes or so. I finally get one from a lovely women not pushing too much, but didn't do much for the dance, but I couldn't complain much, it was a cheap dance. Another lovely lady came to me and we started talking and such. She was wonderful and cool. My friend and I stayed for about 2 hours before we left.

Place was nice inside, just several pushy women, only one or two that weren't. I understand it's their job to get the most for the business. But being super pushy to get overpriced services for little time is nonsense. Nobody would go for it unless they had money to burn or to get rid off.<//text>

<text>This full nudity establishment really needs some improvement. When you enter the place there is a large stage and comfy chairs...but that pretty much sums up the positives of this place. The girls were all sitting in booths looking on their phones looking completely bored while the other girls were constantly using cheesy one-liners to get you into the private rooms. Let's face it - this is a non-alcoholic venue and the only way the girls make some $$$ is to get you in the private rooms. The girls were like piranhas and it got old over time. The real kicker was when we started seeing the girls yawning and looking bored, and that's when the manager walked over to the girls and yelled at them to work the room...This was on a Friday night at midnight..enough said..we left shortly thereafter< /text>< Pictures>

Ummm... no.

Here's what's what:

1) Taxi driver who works for the club to entice you to go there. He'll keep the meter under $10, which basically means it will be $10 to get there (plus tip). But he'll give you a "discount" to get in—which means $30/pp becomes $20.

2) Once you get in the door, be prepared for the onslaught of "HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON TONIGHT!" by a posse of hyper-aggressive girls who literally won't take "no" for an answer. They will try to drag you to the back for a "free" tour, which is neither "free" nor a "tour."

3) The girls onstage take it all off. For about 5 seconds. And in the least sexy manner possible. We left after about ten minutes—literally because the girl was yawning and basically walking around the pole—refusing to engage with us or any of the other customers. And by "fully nude" they mean, "fully nude for about ten seconds."

Don't bother.< /text>

<Review>The lady working behind the desk upstairs is kind of a jerk, she does not make me feel comfortable as a customer. Not to mention the girls in there are super pushy and want you to spend a lot of money and get you high, not cool. Lish is amazing though.

Girls are hella pushy and not anything special. Also tried to get me high in the process. I left my hat because they don't allow beenies I don't care I'm glad I made it out alive.

<text>Selection of woman at this club is the best I've seen in SF (considering it's outside Atlanta, GA) and they're all professional as long as you keep it professional with them. I'm a New Century customer for life based on my Tuesday night experience.

This place suxxx. Wasn't allowed to get in with my warriors beanie which I spent $100 on. They told me to leave it at reception and that I'll get it back on my way out.
Unfortunately for me my hat got stolen and the lady at the reception told me that she was sorry and that there's nothing they could do about it. And then she kept eating her cake as if nothing happened.
The security guy told me they have a no-hat policy, so I should have left my hat at home. How am I supposed to know? That was my first time at the club.
These people are careless, the dancers are mean and the music suxxx.
I wouldn't recommend this place ever.<//Text>

Stay away!!!. They havent returned phone calls after scamming me while I was very intoxicated.  So Now I have to involve the Police as well as my lawyers. It's a big hassle. They will get you intoxicated  and charge you more than promised for services not received.</Text>

Disappointed overall.

Prix entrée correct...de magnifiques femmes mais prix pour des danses privées sont plus qu'excessifs et la plupart des danseuses sont peu agréables.
Déçu dans l'ensemble.< /Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) I went to this club at the end of October 2018.
The atmosphere and top, there are very very beautiful girls, there are small dances at 40dollars but very light
The goal of girls is to go further
But very very expensive a ma say 800dollars for two hours
A ma dis mini 150 for 5 min
Ben ben extremely dear to me
By that
The guy who manages the super simple room passes checks to see if everything is going well ....

(Original)
Je suis aller dans ce club fin octobre 2018.
L ambiance et top, y a de très très belle filles, y a des petites danse a 40dollars mais tres Leger
Le but des filles et d aller plus loin
Mais très très chère une ma dis 800dollars pour deux heures
Une ma dis mini 150 pour 5 min
Ben ben extrêmement chère pour moi
A par cela
Le gars qui gerela salle super simpa passe vérifie si tt va bien....<//Review>

This place has an authentic vibe with great food. Depending on what you order, your food might take quite some time to be prepared so do keep that in mind. It can also a bit pricier than a typical Mediterranean place. Overall, great experience.</text>

By FAR the best Moroccan food in LA. Casablanca is the I my restaurant I have visited in LA that serves authentic Moroccan cuisine. My family is Moroccan, and until visiting this restaurant I had yet to find a single quality Moroccan establishment in LA. Simply the best.<//text>

They gave us a private room for a birthday party where we were able to seat 4 different groups of people at socially distanced tables indoors. The food is authentic, and the photos on the wall and music make you feel like you're in another country.

My favorite dishes were the eggplant and marinated olives for appetizers and the lamb and braised short ribs.

The belly dancer was very talented and was an excellent surprise for the birthday boy.

BYOB.</review>

<Review>Amazing ambiance, authentic food, perfect hospitality! We were searching for an authentic Moroccan food which led us to this place. Don’t be fooled by the exterior as it is not amazing, once you enter the place you will be surprised by how amazingly they have set up the interior. Do not forget the mint tea at the end! Thank you for an amazing evening!< /Review><username>Amina Asif</username><rate>5</rate></record>

Major cross streets are Melrose/LaBrea!

I have my little share of cooking Moroccan food and my first time here we actually dined in and had a really great experience. Anis and Naima are super friendly and cater to you! My descent visit i ordered Cous-Cous with chicken and seven vegetables. I knew what I was having and was excited to get home to grub! If you’re looking for some authentic food this place is a must! Presentation is everything! Wish I had some photos. If you like spice don’t forget to ask for the harissa sauce!< /text>

This is a dining experience not to be missed in LA! The ambience and decor is like being in Morocco, and the complex, delicious flavors of the dishes blew me away! Loved the veggie course, especially the perfectly cooked pastilla!  For the Chicken tagine, the hen is pasture raised- my mom loved it. They serve the BEST couscous in town, by far!<//review>

Tucked behind some vines hanging off the buildings edge, a short walk through the front to a fabulously designed interior with low lighting and comfy seats. Owned by a cultured, global traveled couple who make you feel welcomed and well fed. The food was amazing, the lamb slid right off the bone, the seafood was perfectly seasoned, OH! And the Moroccan mint tea was a crazy wonderful experience in itself. Best first experience with Moroccan food. Thank you, thank you. Will be back soon.</Review>< Date>

If I could give this restaurant 20 stars I would. I went to this place because it had such great reviews and to be honest I'd never seen a restaurant with such a good rating, so I was a bit skeptical it could deliver. Man was I blown away!

Huge foodie and I can honestly say this place is a gem. Unbelievably genuine, delicious flavors. Great service. Atmosphere transports you to the point you forget you're in LA. It's a must go.

By the way, it's BYOB which is amazing :)< /review>

Okay listen to me now and believe me later. Coco Queen is an unassuming but legit stop in Weho. Seriously. The roti chicken is flat awesome - so fragrant and juicy. The sides are amazing - especially the dripping potatoes. But wait - the homemade sauces are freaking mind blowing. I'm not exaggerating. So good. I could drink the garlic aioli. The staff is kind and playful. The French vibe is actually rather authentic - as a fan of the small cafes of Paris myself. Check it out. You won't regret it - or the super affordable Price point!!! My large dinner for two was $36 plus tip.</review>

<time>1615562157862<//time><rating>5</rating><text>What an experience. We went here on a freezing night in LA with crazy rain and thunderstorms.  The place is unassuming. From the outside, it doesn’t look like much. It appears small. You have to walk through the kitchen and a small hallway when you come in, then it opens up to this big beautiful room with billowing curtains, chandeliers and beautiful Moroccan lanterns.
The ambiance couldn’t have been more magical. There were a group of six of us. We sat in the back under the Moroccan curtains in the far back in big enveloping red velvet chairs and uncorked the wines one of our friends had brought along. We were treated like family from the start. The chef came back to meet us and told us we were in for a great, and the night didn’t disappoint. We tried every appetizer and one was better than the next. We all ordered different entrees and looked around at one another’s plates as they were placed in front of us with envy. Everything looked amazing and tasted even better.  We topped the evening off with amazing fresh baclava and freshly baked cookies with mint tea. The ambiance transported you to a warm magical night in Casablanca. The service was impeccable. They treated us like family. The food was absolutely phenomenal.  We will absolutely be back again and again and cannot wait to share this place with all of our friends and family.</text>< Pics>

This was the best Moroccan restaurant Ive ever dined in. The food was authentic and tasteful. The environment puts you in a relaxing mood and takes you to the wonders of Moroccon culture. The staff are so hospitable and friendly. I loved the experience and I highly recommend this place for a unique Moroccan experience. I recommed ending your meal with a soothing hot cup of tea.</Review>

<Review>Here is the place you feel you’re home. They are nice, kind, polite, and respectful. I’m grateful for finding this restaurant. Let’s review it:
1. food
1.1. the taste: I think we tried most of the foods; they are wonderful, all pieces are synthesized, not mixed, I emphasize again, synthesized in one piece. Spices and ingredients are present in harmony while manifesting themselves individually.
1.2. I believe we have tried most of their food, and all confirmed what I said above.
1.3 quality: really good.

2. staff
2.1 they are amazing. I sincerely respect them

3. Ambiance - lovely
3.1 they have background music, mostly Oud (love it)
3.2 Fridays and Saturdays, a belly dancer performs for a while

4.parking
4.1 most probably you find street parking

5. Signature
5.1 hard to say, but their pastillas, lamb, fantastic tea, and bread

6. recommendation
6.1 general: everything
6.2 specific: tea, vegetarian pastillas

7. language
7.1 English, Arabic, French

8. space

Truly amazing and authentic! Everything from the Couscous to  the tajine to the tea was delicious. Super cute little restaurant and super friendly people. It has been a long time since I have been looking for a restaurant to make me feel like I’m at home again. Nothing compares to the experience I had here. Definitely will be back soon when I’m in LA again.<//Text>

This is a great place to come and hangout after a long day after work. I came in the late evening so luckily there were still seats for large parties. I like going here because if you have a larger party, it will accommodate well since the seating are benches

I tried their Belgium and stouts and I was a fan. Not to mention their bratwurst is on point! I recommend any of their exotics since it ranges from mild to strong flavors.< /Review>

<Text>Here is the Moroccan and Arabian restaurant in Los Angeles, we went on Saturday night its the time they have a belly dancing show, and we reserved the VIP table, it was Amazing experience, we ordered the Zalook and the chicken, Scallops and Seafood pastillah, and the Lamb Tajen and the Kofta Tajen and the Koskosi with Lamb shank, the food was great, and the Moroccan Tea was the best ending of remarkable night, Thanks Chef Anees and Naiemah for the great service & hospitality 👍< /Text>< gmap_id>

The food was very tasty and definitely authentic. Restaurant took every precaution to keep us safe.  Only downside was it took very long for the food to come out but I understand restaurants are struggling these days.<//text>

<review>What a wonderful restaurant. Went with my family for a birthday celebration and it did not disappoint. The food and drinks are delicious. Everything is made at home and to order. The atmosphere is lovely with its authentic decor. The owners are lovely and provided a great service. Made everyone feel like they’re at home.  We also brought our dog and they even brought a bowl with water for her. Will definitely be a regular customer. Recommend this to anyone looking for authentic food and a great time.<//review><rating>5<//rating><gmap_id>0x80c2b8d4cf0c0c3b:0xeb4c33be622b8c32</gmap_id>< pics>

<Text>Made a reservation at 9pm for 3 people. Sat down and weren't even greeted until 30 minutes later. They only had a prix fix menu that was never posted on their website or anywhere that they would only have a limited menu. After waiting 30 minutes and finally putting in our order it took another 30 minutes to get our first course which was 3 different tiny salads of beets, cucumber and carrots - should not have taken an additional 30 minutes by any means. THEN we waited another hour before getting our 2nd course which was a chicken pastry. After yet another 30 minutes, (we're at 2 hours and 30 minutes at this point) and still not receiving our main dish, we decided to leave. There was no alcohol (yet another thing they didn't advertise) and so we also had to walk to a local liquor store to get wine. All-in-all after the 2 hr and 30 minute wait for nothing, they still argued with us and were going to charge us the full $55 per person, but after almost walking out, they settled at $40 per person - for literal beets, cucumber, carrots and pastry that I could have bought at Vons for $5. Don't waste your time. I wish I could get those hours of my life back.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2b8d4cf0c0c3b:0xeb4c33be622b8c32<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>We received food credit from a food blogger off Instagram. So we decided to eat here after watching Family Feud live. It is so close to everything, and the environment is very classy with a modern feel. The only criticism I have factoring why I did not give a 5 star is the customer service. My friends and I waited at least 30 minutes without water nor menu, as the waitress did not know about the food credit. I feel like, either way, we should have been seated with water and menus. Seemed unprofessional.
However the food is delicious. They apologized with 2 complimentary desserts. Pizzas were freshly made right in front of me through a glass barrier and pasta tasted great!< /review>< rating>

Exquisite flavors and the best Moroccan food. A few years ago we toured Morocco and fell in love with light sweet and savory pastillas, and tagines with their dark thick sauces. Since that visit we have tried every local Moroccan restaurant, but were never satisfied until we discovered Casablanca Moroccan Kitchens. If you like well yet delicately flavored food you will love this restaurant.< /text>

I really wanted to love this place... The staff were pleasant and the belly dancer was awesome, but they were out of half of their menu (and when I made reservation I specifically told them I am pescatarian. They were out of Salmon, shrimp,  and lamb) didn't get any food for over an hour, one of the meals were wrong, and there were no heating lamps for outside seating.</review>

Believe me or not, this place is a hidden gem in L.A. that you will regret not trying. Saloua and I enjoyed every second there, and we are so grateful for finding this restaurant. The owners are very nice, kind, and respectful, the ambiance is lovely: you definitely feel you are home. The food was wonderful (special mention to the lamb tajin that was exquisite with a perfect harmony of tastes), and the tea and bread so delicious. I warmly recommend anyone to try their foods. I would give 6 stars to this restaurant if I could.< /Review>

<text>Casablanca Moroccan Kitchen is amazing! 110% would recommend. The food is incredibly authentic, so much so that it transported us back home to my husbands Moroccan family’s house. My Mexican family was absolutely blown away.
The owners Naima and her husband are so very attentive, welcoming and very friendly.
Make sure you try one of their lamb dishes. The lamb Tagine and the Kafta is my absolute favorite. Also, the moroccan iced tea is to die for!
We love you! and wish to dine here for many years to come!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Amazing “ Real Moroccan “ Restaurant .. everything on the menu is very authentic !
As a Moroccan customer it was really hard for me to find a real authentic Moroccan restaurant That did not try to change things around, which is a complete failure when it comes to Moroccan cuisine .
I have tried at least half a dozen of different Moroccan Spots around San Diego, Orange county and LA and I really wasn’t impressed .
Now this is literally my only place, I wouldn’t go to another Moroccan restaurant if you paid me . Lol .
Honest truth !< /text>

Recently opened, family run business, French trained chef that I just loved!!  I’m familiar with the previous space, will you walk through the kitchen to get the back covered patio, which is very romantic. The food portions are very generous, so bring your appetite!  A muse bouche was offered as herbed cheese am with lovely cruchy crusty bread and soft interior.   I had the lobster lentil soup to start, the half lobster tail was grill to perfection with lots of great flavors. Next, veal shank braised in a clay pot (Tajina) was tender flavorful and lovely citrus flavors.  Then best yet was the dessert options which I can’t wait to try all three.  Welcome to the neighborhood and can’t wait to go back!!  Also BYOB with no corkage< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Amazing place where you can taste the Moroccan Cuisine and feel the Eastern Atmosphere. The menu is really good and diverse. The stuff is Very friendly. Hope for them the best.

Young people who deny desires, visit Morocco, and change the atmosphere a little in the happy place. Anis and Naima Magadish give up their effort.

<Review>Round table is the best pizza near me.  The one up on N.  Brea has better prices than the one on Chapman too.  Speedy pick up service. Crew is always friendly.  This isn't a cheap charlie pizza, but if you are looking for a fresh well made high quality pizza at a good price they are great.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>I placed an order for two pizzas for pickup. When I got to the location and picked up my food. I should have checked before leaving. But one pizza was completely wrong. I didn't find this out until i got back home. I immediately called the place back, let them know I was on my way back with the wrong pizza. I get back to the location and have to wait for them to make a new one. This time I look before I left and THEY STILL GOT IT WRONG. I immediately asked for my money back since it's  really hard to make 1 pizza. Will no longer do business with this location and when I asked how to get in touch with the manager I got no response. So I will try to contact that person during the week and let them know how they lost a loyal customer</review>< Pictures>

People who work there are nice, love the pizza.  It would have been a 5-star review if it wasn't so hot in the restaurant.  It was a hot day but the temperature read 87° on the inside.<//Review>

<text>Pizza was great.  The interior of the restaurant was a little messy (flour on the floor of the customer area).  The salad bar was not lit up making it a little unattractive and begging the question, why? The booths are uncomfortable, carpet needs cleaning and overall the interior looks dated. That being said....the food was good :-)</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

One thing that I can count on for Round Table Pizza is good pizza. Their recipe has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid, and even in college.

This Round Table is similar to other pizza parlor places (like Shakey’s). They serve pizza, have a salad bar, have beer, and a small arcade for the kids.

It’s not a fancy place, but the pizza is pretty good.< /text>

Wonderful staff and good food. Pizza was just right, I had the thin crust with pepperoni and mushroom. Had the salad bar which had fresh lettuce and vegetables. Staff was attentive and excellent.</text>

If you like round table this location is awesome great service. The owners take pride in their business and employees. I urge the owners of this location to buy out the bozos running the location in La Habra.</Text>

I heard this place is now under new management and wanted to try it. We ordered the King Arthur Supreme pizza, barbecue wings, and buffalo wings...ALL DELICIOUS!  They serve beer and wine, and they have a game room too.  And we were met with AWESOME customer service!  I definitely recommend this as a go-to-spot for family and friends!</Text>

My first visit here in support of a basketball fundraiser. The order came out quickly and was perfect. Staff was friendly. I had a small problem... somehow my boxed left overs were cleared off the table with the dishes. Disappointing, but not the end of the world. The staff went above and beyond to make it right. I felt valued and appreciated as a customer. I don't live in Brea, but I'll be sure to visit this location again and do recommend. The Flatbread chicken veggie pizza was delicious! There is fireplace in the dining area that creates a nice ambience. I like to support business that support the community...Great job Roundtable Brea!< /Text>

<Review>Pizza was much better than a typical pizza delivery place.  It is a sit down establishment with the fancy COKE machine as well as a small arcade with tickets and prizes for the kiddos.  The pizza is very good.  They have a bar with a variety of beers and wines!  I love the fact that they had big HD TVS with all the games on.  Great place to take a group or team.  Great place to go with the wife/husband and kids.<//Review>< Pictures>

Place sucks!   We brought our softball girls here to eat giving this place a lot of business and they kicked us out an hour later when our 10 year old girls were just playing.  We were so nice and respecting of this place and the owner just kicked us out cause we stop buying stuff.  I'll never come back</Review>

<text>Had really good experience here. Sharon greeted us with a friendly smile and told us about their promotions. She offered to take a look at their jewellery  since it was 60% off plus additional 10% off entire store. So I ended up buying a gold necklace and two beautiful rings for such a great price! I’m happy. Thanks to Sharon 😊</text>< Date>

Specific review for the Bobby Brown sales associate, Kelly. She is not only incredibly good at what she does (nailed my skin tone for foundation on the first try) but she’s delightful, funny, giving and knowledgeable. My skin has transformed so much with her recommendations. I won’t work with anyone else there... she goes overboard to meet my skincare and make up needs. For the first I wouldn’t rather shop online. Thank you Kelly!<//Text>

First time going to this location and found some good deals. The guy who works there was very helpful as well and if I’m not mistaken his name was Mario.< /review>

The store is built with open architecture. . .very well lit. making it an enjoyable shopping experience.  My favorite sales person is Sherry.  She pays attention to detail and has a pleasant and effervescent approach to customer service.<//review>

Saks Fifth Avenue was wonderful when I bought my wedding gown six years ago and they were just as wonderful when I took my mother to buy her gown for her 50th wedding anniversary!<//Review>

< Review>
Sadly to say, always enjoyed my visit to this establishment but unfortunately encountered inexperienced girl assistant after invested on some cream and perfume products to dare having the audacity of telling me and I quote
" who let you in"??!!
So Being astonished and yet respectful I decided to leave the premises without making a scene!
So with all due respect having a sales person with no credentials is no way how to treat paying customers for future business.

I hope this message seeks the managers & directors to NOT over see this poor service and to attend to it immediately.

Thank you</Review>

Saks is the based OG (that was for my teenager). But it's an original, truly. Quality and service. We don't waste money or time here. We invest it.<//text>

I was helped by Anna in contemporary who couldn’t figure out how to do a return. She talked and acted like a gang banger, was so shocked Prestigious Saks would hire such a slob! She could not even work the register. Even at one point asking me for my credit card number and pin to look up a purchase. Sadly Saks has lost its prestige.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dafe7ac2a01ed9:0x84d230781a0aacac< /gmap_id></record>

I find the sales people at Saks fifth ave. very friendly and professional. I find the the remarks made by  the so called “marketing executive “ and” SR” very inaccurate and mean spirited . It seems some people think to give a review they have to personally attack other people who they don’t know. That’s not what reviewing is about and I would think a marketing director would know this . Let’s stay professional when giving a review.< /review>

Awful and atrocious behavior here. I was helped by a women named Paula Maietta who was very rude and verbally abusive to me while at the register.  Since I have filed a complaint with their corporate office. This woman is a who is a very scary looking creature and used this to intimidate me while shopping. I was verbally abused by this disgrace of a woman for wanting to do a simple exchange. I surly hope Saks can clean house because the store is a ghost town and the employees seems lazy especially Paula who Has a very bad presence at Saks she seems like a very miserable person.  Since speaking to colleagues about her behavior they have all stated similar experiences with Paula. Very unfortunate to see someone weighing the company down. (Literally)</text>

Saks Fifth Avenue in Palm Desert is a wonderful large department store. The store is spacious with clothing for Men, Woman and Children from many different designers. The staff is very professional and attentive.</Review>

I ordered something online using corporate email and corporate card which I don’t have access
anymore. The sales person Sam didn’t help me at all and when I was asking
him to try some other ways to look up the purchase, he sharply responded me that
he doesn’t want to lose customers that want to buy stuff and he doesn’t have time to
help me. I’m not used to attitudes like this and as a customer who have spent thousands of
dollars in this store I deserve respect. Sam Kavenchy must be fired.< /review>

Its holiday gift time at the Estee Lauder counter! Trust me, they have the best gifts with your purchase than most other luxury brands at Saks...other brands expect you to spend a high dollar amount on purchased, but not Estee Lauder. The gift sets are always a great value filled with luxury skincare and trendy makeup newness!🎄🎁</Review>

< Review>
I went in to exchange a pair of shoes that were a defect. I had the receipt, the original box and in the original condition. The shoes were never worn outside my home. These are very expensive shoes that were a Christmas gift. Further, I was willing to pay extra $$$ for the a good pair without defects.  However, the manager Mr. Stevens (son) insited that there were no defects and refused to exchange them. He insisted that I take them to another branch (6hours away) where the orinal receipt is from. He lacks basic common courtesy, proffesionalism and customer service. That said, if a negative star was an option he would get that instead. All in all, just an awful experiance dealing with an awful person.</Review>

I just stood in line waiting for parts and overheard Angel J telling a customer he can't use synthetic oil and go back to conventional oil.  This misinformation is severely flawed taken as an absolute.  It is perfectly safe to switch between synthetic and conventional oils provided your engine seals and gaskets are healthy.  Synthetic oil provides better protection but has more aggressive detergents that clean your engine better BUT potentially expose gasket and seal failure.  Bottom line, any leaks are ultimately caused by old/faulty seals and gaskets.  As long as your engine is't leaking any oil, use what oil you please and/or fits your budget.  Simply make sure it's the proper viscosity for your engine.< /text>

<Review>While visiting the Pico Rivera location, I was assisted by Nick V that proceeded to check the battery in my vehicle and determined i needed a new one, he proceeded to look it up on the computer and unfortunately it stated that they did not have one in stock but he went above and beyond and found the last one in the back. He proceeded to replace the old one with the new one although it was getting dark out and visibility was minimal as it was pointed out by his manager. He went above and beyond his job and educating me on the new batteries warranty and details. I was beyond pleased with the commitment and pride he took in his job and assuring that I had every need met before leaving the store.< /Review>< Pics>

<user_id>118026879638639321385<//user_id><Text>I want to start off by saying I’ve been a member of auto zone for several years now.
Overall the store is a great place with a lot knowledgeable workers.
But I am giving one star today because it was the worst experience I had when coming to this place to pick up some stuff I order online.
I decided to try out curbside pick up, but autozone never gave me a conformation notice to pick up my things, I waited patiently for two days.
Never received an email saying “my stuff was ready for pick up” keep in mind it was only two items that I needed.
I called the place but when I did I would get a worker on the phone with a nasty attitude.
I forgotten the mans name but he didn’t seemed reasonable, not even when I went to go pick up my stuff, they were still
Giving me attitude. I tried calling ahead letting them know I was on my way to
Pick up my stuff. But had me on hold for a very long time, so I decided to go in like a normal person just to get my items.
One of the workers made me get in the line even though I told him I came to pick up something i ordered online, the worker didn’t seem to care and told me to get in line still. I guess he was giving me snarky looks and his attitude because i came in without a mask.
Since he was complaining about it,
I told the gentleman I don’t wear a mask because of a religious belief, and you wouldn’t believe what the worker said. He said with a strong nasty tone, “DONT GIVE ME THAT RELIGIOUS CRAP”. After that he left in a rush not letting me explain to him about it. I felt discriminated and embarrassed in front of my wife and kid
So if your a religious believer like myself, be careful with this place they don’t care if they discriminate you in front of your loved ones or anybody you come along with.
not even if u been a member for autozone all your life.
I do believe it goes against your “code of conduct” when your putting customer last.
What happen to putting customers first? 🧐
It’s against the law when your discriminating ones belief. Autozone owner I suggest you educate your workers when it comes down to a religious belief, I don’t want to come in again and get treated like a low class citizen I will be filing an affidavit to your corporate office if this were to ever occur again, very unacceptable. In your own code of conduct it also mentions to treat everyone with dignity and respect which is a fundamental right on your behalf, I advise you to use your own advise that you give to customers and employees.< /Text>< rate>

Horrible customer service. Was getting keys done by representative angel, who was doing a good job until his co worker, Dart , came along and decided to stop him to make a key for another customer. Basically telling me that the other customers time was more important than mine. He then confused my order telling me they wouldn’t have one of my keys when the other representative had told me all the ones they would have. Very rude representatives make good employees look bad in situations like this.</text>

As always great prices and service is on point. They are friendly and patient. Even if you don't know the name of the part. They take the time to figure it out  what you need. Take advantage of their reward program. Every purchase accumulates point which exchange as a credit to buy items at the store. I had about $20 worth of points so my items were free.< /review>

TODAY I CAME INTO AUTOZONE AT LEAST 4 TIMES FOR THE PARTS AND STUFF I NEEDED PLUS RETURNS AND WHAT NOT. I HAVE TO LEAVE A POSITIVE REVIEW FOR THE MANAGER SHE WAS GOOD, I LIKE THAT SHE ASKED EXACTLY WHO'S ACCOUNT MY REWARDS POINTS WERE ON AND SHE ASKED ME TO HAVE HIM COME IN WITH ME SO THERES NO DISCREPANCIES. EVEN AS AN INCONVENIENCE AS IT MAY BE I APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT SHE IS TRYING TO SURE THAT IT WAS LEGIT. I LIKE THAT. IT GAVE ME A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE STORE.<//text>

The line to pay and get parts was wrapped around an isle.   On the most part people were keeping their distance.   I was being patient waiting my turn.  Unfortunately, the employees were receiving many calls from other stores.  A few customers behind me became a bit vocal.   The employee asked for those who are only paying to go to the pay line.  I was at the register when the vocal customer began to step in front of me.  I informed him I was next inline and he began patting my arm.  I had to tell him not to touch me.   Employees were a bit overwhelmed and didn’t see much that was happening.  They were doing their best.<//text>

Service was "okay".. right now stakes are high and several employees were not properly wearing their face masks.   thankfully, the one that helped me was.. and it was rather quickly. But i would've liked my situation resolved,  rather than just wait to see what happens.<//review>

I was having some issues with a car battery that I had previously purchased from AutoZone, and came into this location to get it checked out. I was helped by Luis, who was eager to help me out. Luis was very professional and friendly, but what I really appreciated was that he genuinely cared about the issues that I was having and provided tips to help me take better care of my car battery. He took a look at my battery and confirmed that it was still under warranty. He took out my battery, and replaced it with a brand new one within 5 minutes, and that was it. It was done. Easy peasy. I really appreciate the help that I received from Luis, and tried to tip him but he told me that they can't take tips, so I decided just to write a review instead to shine a light on this outstanding service. Thanks again Luis, your service is very much appreciated!< /text>

This particular store was open later than other store locations. I was very pleased with that. Our cars don't always need something between 9 am - 10 pm. It wasn't far from me either. It's another good place to look at items to "dress up" your car to make it feel "pretty".</text>

Had a great experience here! My car was having trouble starting and I was going to go to the mechanic but came here to get the battery tested first. Cecy, Ken and Joshua were extremely helpful! They tested the battery, alternator and starter. The battery was bad and Ken changed it out. I even got a discount by turning in my old battery! Even though they got busy, they still made time to help me. Thanks to their kindness and amazing customer service, they saved me a lot of time, stress and money. Thank you all so much!

I 'dislike' auto parts stores with a passion! Unfortunately because my daily commute to work is over 2 hours a day, I want to make sure that my car is in the best condition to face traffic. So I came to this shop and I can definitely say that I Love coming in here!! Everyone is so friendly and helpful. I don't feel 'dumb' like I have been made to feel at other auto parts stores. They know exactly what my car needs. When they don't  know, Alfred comes to the rescue and will find  it immediately.
This will be my store from now on.
Today I was helped by Menny,  and Alfred was there to assist, thank you guys, you are Amazing!</Text>

< Review>
poor service.
[edited] I walked for 20 minutes to get an emergency starter from my home. At the store, I put my wet hat in my backpack. Then one of the employees approached and asked me to show my bag in a rude manner. I showed it and there was nothing but a wet hat in my bag. He left without saying anything. Anyone in this situation would have felt insulted. It was a terrible experience in my whole life.</Review>

I went too O’ Reilly’s first to ask about my battery situation, the girl was so rude so I left and went too autozone and I give it a 5 star because the Guy who helped me out with my battery was such a gentleman and very helpful! ☺️ I was trying too read his name tag I couldn’t see , if maybe I’m right his name was Louie hopefully I’m right but I was pleased with his work and just so nice! 👍🏻☺️</Review>

Been coming here 12 years as I live down the street and normally they have everything instock since they have big stock of parts.  Used to be good service and bonus of open late. Now its just bad, Everytime I come is worse. Takes for ever to get anything..wrong parts given out. Employees lack training on customer service and parts look up. Came to dispose of oil today took 30min. Get in line and wait is what I was told untill someone frees up, this didn't bother me was polite and I saw how bad it was with just 6-7 people already in there. One of the employees apologize and said 3 employees at lunch at the same time to a customer who left she was really upset said 45minutes couldn't be helped with light bulbs... LIGHT BULBS the guy couldn't look them up.  Saw a customer told to wait for the only guy knew what he was doing (grey shirt) by a lady (short, not good with English, not sure her name but she shouldn't be working here been "helped" by here before and usually ends up not knowing and I have to wait for someone else) because she didn't know how to look up a part that was put on hold by other branch. The other employee was stuck looking for a part he couldn't locate for 20minutes till finally the guy in grey told him it's not in location it's missing can't help customer out, not sure how long the guy was actually there that was just from what I saw. Worse of all they didn't offer to look up other location and place hold for him!
At one point guy Martin ( guy in grey shirt) called someone, asking for help upfront as they were falling behind really bad at this point at least 7 people behind me. At least 10 min from that call till I left and no one came up.
Even when there isn't 3 employees at lunch at same time and theye are full staff theyre service isn't quick, very relaxed no sense of urgency sometimes here conversations no where near work related while customers just stand there waiting.  They are getting to dmv level of service at this location and even the environment seems that way, carless employees and upset customers. The only people seems to care is Martin and an older lady glasses really short hair ( I should know here name been there for a while and always very polite and helpful and has good base knowledge of parts)  are the only two I would not fire if I was management there everyone else would get $##T canned.  Better off going .5 miles down Whittier to O'Riley's.< /text>

<review>one winter me and my friends were going up the lake arrowhead.  because i wanted to be prepare i bought the snow chain before i went up to the mountain.  the employee input my car information to the system and got me chain.  i drove up to the mountain and try to put the chain in my tire and found out that the size didn't match.  i was so upset and mad.  i was already up in the mountain and it was snowing.  the roads were all icy and covered with snow.  i reach out to autozone but they didn't do nothing to reimburse me for my money.  these employees or autozone don't know what they are doing.  i put my life in their hand and almost lost my life.  never will shop at autozone again.< /review>< username>

<Text>one winter me and my friends were going up the lake arrowhead.  because i wanted to be prepare i bought the snow chain before i went up to the mountain.  the employee input my car information to the system and got me chain.  i drove up to the mountain and try to put the chain in my tire and found out that the size didn't match.  i was so upset and mad.  i was already up in the mountain and it was snowing.  the roads were all icy and covered with snow.  i reach out to autozone but they didn't do nothing to reimburse me for my money.  these employees or autozone don't know what they are doing.  i put my life in their hand and almost lost my life.  never will shop at autozone again.< /Text>< rating>

Waste of time. Drove all the way from another autozone because it was supposedly in stock. Got there and was told it wasn't there. Even after someone had called in about it. Never shopping here again< /review>
