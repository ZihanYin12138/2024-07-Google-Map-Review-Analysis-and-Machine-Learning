The staff here  have been nothing but a pleasure to work with. I think what separates Johnny from other agents is the customer service. Filing a claim has not been easier. All I did was call Johnny and he handled the rest.

Recommended him to multiple friends and family members.</review>

< Review>
My family and I have been with Juan Castaneda Farmers Insurance  for the past 13 years. Since the first day we met him he has always been available to us by phone, email and in person. Anytime we have a question he is always available to provide us information. Johnny is very knowledgeable when it comes to having proper coverage for our auto, home and life insurance needs. I have recommended several family members and friends to Juan Castaneda Farmers Insurance and they haven't been happier just like us. When it comes to insurance you really need some one who is there for you and we are extremely happy with the services and products we have with Farmers. Thank you Johnny for always being on top of it and treating us like family. We appreciate you very much.<//Review>

I have been a more that satisfied  Farmers customer for years now. My agent Johnny Casteneda is always there for me. If I have questions or concerns I have never hesitated to reach out. I know I may not understand some of the policy guidelines, but he has always been able to explain to me in a way I can digest it.  I will continue to be a happy customer!! Thank you for all you do as a company!</Text>

Johny is very transparent and makes your policy easy to understand. He made getting insurance with him a learning experience, he went into detail so I understand every aspect of my coverage.
Very competitive pricing/coverage.

Johnny and his office have been amazing. Had AAA before and had a terrible experience.  Switched to Farmer's and Johnny walked me through every aspect of the my new policy and coverage and answered all the questions I had. He made sure I understood everything. He has now been my agent for several years and he is still always available whenever I have questions and is always very knowledgeable.<//text>

Juan has been our best insurance agent by far , at our age we have had plenty of other companies . We had Allstate as well as AAA  and let me say that out these Farmers represented by your agent Juan Casteda has been the greatest and by far the best experience with an insurance company . He’s professional as well as friendly and his knowledge unsurpassed . That’s why I always recommend him to my family as well as everybody I know . Thank you farmers for having an agent  at our reach that cares about us .

Yours truly , Gus and Juanita Rocha .< /Review>

We have  been with Johnny castaneda since we bought our first home. Johnny was so helpful with understanding the way home owners insurance works . Being new home owners we were so lost.within our first couple weeks we had problems with our house n Johnny made it all smooth sailing on what we needed to do.we have saved so much money with Johnny's guidance n knowledge, he is always on top of things. I highly recomend farmers insurance and Johnny for your agent.< /review>

<text>:: Edited below:: I'd this place closed? Passed environmental inspection (notice on door), but padlocked with lights on during business hours. Made me sad. ☹️

Edit:

The owner came back and apologized to my review. Very respectable. 😎👍 Changed my rating, they deserve it. :: To the owner, I hope all is well, take care and be safe.< /text>< Name>

I only found this place because I googled bars in old town Sacramento otherwise I probably would have never noticed it.
I went two days in a row. The first night Saturday it was pretty busy. They have lots of pool tables, and friendly bar tenders.
Sunday was more slow and laid back. The bar tender pulled up a chair and chatted with us for a bit.
Really cool place.</Text>

When people say that they want to hang out at a cool dive bar, this is what they mean. A great selection of beer and liquor, and a fun menu of house cocktails. The staff is awesome and they have tons of space, including multiple pool tables and an air hockey table. A really fun hang out. I'll definitely be going back.</text>

Cash only seedy dive bar in a basement.  Beer prices were ok. Service was rude and unwelcoming, beer selection was lacking.  Not the cleanest place. Plenty of better options in the area that aren't cash only.  Overall, it is what it is. A dive.< /Text>

<review>I think Vega's Underground is a pretty nice place to drink and socialize. You can meet really nice people. I used to live in Sacramento. but now live in Camden, New Jersey. Vega's a wonderful place to chill at.<//review>< Pics>

How are you going to advertise about "BULK MAILING" (Where your business customers come to drop off their loads of packages) and put up "EMPLOYEE ONLY SIGNS" on the only entrance to the drop off zone? Not only that, they faced the containers away from the dock, FORCING you to have to take the stairs. BUT WAIT, it's for "EMPLOYEES ONLY"?! WHERE'S THE SENSE IN THIS?< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The stairs to the deck where you can drop off packages are only for employees. People who come here to drop off package will have to jump/climb up/hang themselves up or however they can from the parking lot to be able to manage to drop the packages up to the containers up on the high deck (while cars moving in and out). This is so insanely nonsense and dangerous.
Yesterday I saw Michael, the African American staff, asked an Asian customer to clim up the ramp to the deck (not using stairs), which is so dangerous. And for some reason, he kicked the base of the paper container to make all of the Priority Mails fall out all over the floor for the Asian customer to pick it up back to the container (while he was standing looking down on him picking the packages). Whatever the reason might be, this is so wrong and rude. The organization is crazy and the staff is so rude !< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Worst post office I’ve ever came across. They delay shipping packages and try to make you pay for more overage outrageous postal fees. They don’t answer your calls and they seem like they don’t know what their doing. They must be a new untrained staff over there.  I’m not sure if that sent it correctly back to me...still lost in transit.   I think they are really shady. Hopefully I’ve never have to send any more packages to their low leveled post office. 2 thumbs down!< /Text>

<text>Michael is the best!!
I've only ever done mass mailing here and my experience has been excellent! For my first time, I came in with a large bag of Priority and First Class Mail packages to mail out and stood in line because I wasn't sure how else to proceed. Michael appears seemingly out of nowhere, as if he occasionally circulates to spot confused faces, and helped me right out!
He kindly and patiently showed me where to go for mass mailing, how to sort out the packages and scan them and gave some very helpful tips and tricks, as well!

It seems as if he's always there to help, too, if you ever have any issues or questions.

Because of my experience with Michael, if I knew anyone who needed to mail out a large number of packages, I'd definitely recommend this place!!
Parking is super easy, too, if you're doing mass mailing here. You can drive into the large parking lot via 1st St or Garfield, and park right up front by the sorting station.</text><date>1555630059546< /date><resp>None<//resp></record>

<Review>First of all....my apartment complex has mailboxes for all the residents and apparently our group of mailboxes has a broken masterkey and it has been a month now and still no new masterkey replaced. We are having to go to the Post Office every week to check for our mail and the employees are not thrilled to have to stop what they are doing to check. They are not helpful when asked about the masterkey and they claim to not know anything.</Review>< gmap_id>

This place is incredibly understaffed. Always busy. And manger/supervisor does not have any decent customer service etiquette. I just dropped in to fill out several money order inquiry forms and I needed some assistance in filling them out. I came several minutes before they opened this morning and waiting in line.  I’ve been waiting +45 minutes at this frivolous place. Once I got in line, I asked several questions if it’s possible to track money orders if they’ve been checked in. They couldn’t even answer that and asked me to just fill out the forms. I requested six forms but received five official copies and one copied version. They didn’t even have enough official document forms!! I didn’t quite understand some of the fill in boxes so I wanted to ask a representative to help me filling these out. Instead of receiving answers, I got pushed aside to wait for some reason. After waiting 20 minutes, I asked to speak to their supervisor, who by the way, happened to step towards the cashier area. She tells me to wait some more without giving me a definite time frame. Basically I wasted an hour with absolutely  no representative helping me out. I just needed someone to help me fill it out! How ridiculous is this? How are they even open and running?< /Text>

<review>Horrible service all the way around. When this was my local post office, packages would arrive but sometimes a slip wouldn't be placed in the box. I had to go directly to the front to ask if they had my package but if I didn't have tracking numbers and other proof, they would say they never received it.

When I would check tracking numbers online, they would cease to be updated once they reached this post office or have incorrect information saying someone else picked it up or it was sent to another post office.

Now that I no longer live in the area, I set up a mail forward over 6 months ago. But I received forwarded mail no more than 3 times, and only after persistently contacting them about not receiving any mail.

None of my packages were forwarded. I had to go in person and pick up several packages, and practically demand that future ones be forwarded, after which they still did not forward any.

My current post office responds to phone calls immediately and online claims within 24 hours with direct calls and personal service. In comparison, this post office responded to 1 out of several claims with a generic email where the postal worker didn't bother filling in the boxes that said [insert information here] with anything. Additionally, this post office's phone number just rings through no matter what time you call.

I am very pleased to no longer have to associate with this post office. I am also pleased that the post office is changing to include nicer staff and self-serve kiosks, so hopefully, if things don't improve, customers can at least work around the poor service.< /review></record>

Like most small local USPS, they're severely understaffed, in a building that's clearly showing its age. The lack of parking doesn't help either (just park at the Chase, no other way). Nonetheless, the employees do their best, and still provide good service, just be prepared to spend at least 30 min there.< /Text>

Customer service from the manager is, for the most part, non-existent. This location DOES NOT provide walk-in service for passports, regardless of what the US Department of State says. There are much better options for parcel and passport services near
by, use them.<//Text>

< Review>
I have a PO Box here and so I'v used this office regularly for nearly 10 years. Post offices are busy and like any other busy place you either accept the long lines during busy hours, or try to go when there aren't long lines. Certain things for me haven't worked out perfectly here, but the  individuals who work behind the counter have never given me less than good service, and usually it's great, and considering how busy it is, I'd say most of the time they do a fantastic job.

I got my passport here too, and I was dreading that, but as others have said, the lady who helps with that process is wonderful. And a few times she has helped behind the counter with mail issues, and she is super nice then too.

There are lots of busy/grumpy/impatient/demanding customers, but the employees who work here keep it cool and get people through as fast as possible.

If you want a quiet post office, try a different one, cause this one is busy. But the people who work here do their best and they do a good job.</Review>

I go in and there is no one at the counters. Use the self service machine and it doesn't print a receipt. Takes 5 minutes for anyone to come to the counter while the line just gets longer and longer. The facility is falling apart. It looks like the place hasn't had a single upgraded since 1950. I would not come back here if I had a choice. Don't come here if you have a choice</Review>

These people are very nice and completely helpful. They have a great system, with a person designated to help you with things that may not require you to stand in line if you don't want to, like buying postage, picking up a package, or renewing a p.o. box. Classic old building. (The on-the-street carriers I've met have been great too.) Recommend.</Text>

<review>I've used 4 or 5 post offices around the city and I'd agree that generally, USPS sucks in LA. The same problems seem to plague every location: never answer the phone; long lines; difficulty resolving virtually any problem. This location is not much different...

That being said- the staff at this location genuinely try to be pleasant, they do try to move the line along by getting the easy customers out of the way (drop-offs, pick-ups, info requests, etc.) and are far and away much more helpful in answering questions than other USPS locations.

I'm giving them a 4/5 because they are definitely a BETTER location than any of the others I've visited.< /review></record>

< Review>
This is the best Post Office in America! Every single one of the employees is great, affable, a good person, the old fashion way. I feel that the USPO in Alhambra reflects the very soul of who we are as a community. I always commend them when I send a package or buy stamps. They are wonderful people and do their job exceedingly well. Unfortunately, with the Federal cuts in the USPS and all, we have less and less of this personable service and more machines. Apparently, the Postal Service is losing money. What a shame! I will miss this little remnant of Americana!<//Review>

After waiting in line, I go to the next available clerk, but she directed me to the guy next to her because she doesn't do them. so i wait for the guy. After waiting a few minutes, he asks if was getting a passport, i said yes, he asked if i was renewing or first time, i said first time, he said that he only does renewals and to come back tomorrow because the girl that does them didn't come in. what a joke.. Only 1 person is qualified to process passports there? what a joke. i'll just go to Montebello or make an appointment at the library.<//review>< Pictures>

This post office is convenient and strategic, near to most of the landmarks in the city (Alhambra High, Civic Library, Police Dept, Court, City Hall, etc.) so it's in the middle of everything else. However, I suggest that a post office should be open earlier than 8.30, like 8.00 to support people, who work at 9, can stop by to do postal service or do passport processing before going to work. They can close earlier though.< /Text>

“Saturday”Well came in for the passport as I walked inside the line was huge for the packages to be picked up or people sending mail I walked over to the passport area not knowing I had to to sign in ok that’s fine someone told me so went over to sign in not knowing it was booked for today not only that this says they open at 9 am WRONG guy working the counter said they opened at 7am for passport so I was like WOW so my conclusion is get here early on Saturdays I know it says 9 don’t believe it be here early and you might be seen I give them a 2⭐️ cause of the line I seen walking in but don’t get me wrong workers are probably doing there best to handle these customers and the passport was just not cooperative nor signs being up saying they open at 7am<//Review>

<date>1387471670128< /date><Rate>1</Rate><review>This is absolutely the worst USPS.  I have packages not delivered by them, however FedEx, UPS, and Ontrac seem to do just fine.  After I request a redelivery, nothing happens.  When I go pick stuff up, they can't seem to find my items.  Two weeks later the item is either returned to sender or else finally gets dropped off.  Many times my items are marked as delivered, but nothing has come.  I have had to complain numerous times that items are not delivered and nothing changes, but only gets worse.  I have no idea what this post office is doing but I do know if I was in charge, I would fire everyone in management and replace them all with people from offices that actually work well.  Then figure out which delivery personnel were just as bad and fire them as well.  What is really the worst is that I actually like my postal carrier.  He is very nice.  It is all just so frustrating.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Worst Ever. A government run institution at its finest. Said they missed me at home to give me a package which was fine. I go to the post office the next day to pick up said package only to way 20 minutes before finding out that they couldn't find it. I leave and come back 4 hours later to see if they had found it. They had but the biggest problem was the fact they the package itself could have fit in my mail box. It was tiny and I've receive douzens of the same size package in my mail box before. Why not this time. I'll never know.< /Text>< Pictures>

PLEASE what ever you do DO NOT use this post office. They stole my $50 dollars. I had a $50 parking ticket and I used them to send it and of course they didn't send it. Because they never sent it, my parking ticket now rose to $100! Then again maybe I'm in the wrong...I'm thinking that this post office has a shipping fee of $50. Or actually maybe it was a service fee of $50? Maybe I should open up a post office and just steal people's money. It sounds like a pretty good business move. Anyways, I hope the Chinese food you bought with my $50 gives you diarrhea.</Review>

<Review>I have been coming to this post office for years with no problem.  Since I print stamps online, all I do here is drop off packages and leave.  Nothing else.  Yesterday the postmaster (Asian guy in his 40's) yelled at me in a very, very rude tone for not honking when backing up my car.  Told him I did not know it was the USPS policy since no sign was posted anywhere.  He told me never to let him see me in "his" post office again (or else!!).  He walked up to me, in a menacing way, until he was inches from my face and asked if I wanted to do something about it.  Another customer saw what was happening and start telling this guy to stop bullying me.  This postmaster walked up to that customer and told him not to come back to "his" post office also.

I am an online seller that spent at least $6,000 a month on postage.  This is the only post office near my house, or I could drive 3 miles to the next post office to avoid this kind of ugly incident from happening again.  I filed a complain with the Inspector General's website yesterday after the incident.  Hopefully, something will be done about this guy before he really starts hurting someone.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This is by far the worst USPS. They never answer the phone and they are extremely rude. I would completely try to avoid this place!!!! When i was there i complained to the supervisor about no one answering the phone. He said at times we get busy, however, while we were having this conversation i was calling on my cell phone and no one bother to pick up the phone. I mentioned it to the supervisor and he could even answer me. He had this stupified look on his face. THE WORST USPS IN THE WORLD!!!!!!<//review>

<Review>It says they take walk-ins for passport service in the web page and I called to make sure they will. A lady said YES. But when I was there, the old lady doing passport and her supervisor I believe his last name is Su said they take appointments only and they are already full. I ask them if they can take us in because I saw no one was there waiting in line, they say NO. The only words they kept saying is "I have no idea about that, but you need make an appointment." Haha, ridiculous!

Every employee should understand and talk to clients the service policies clearly, no misunderstandings at all. Either update your website or take the walk-ins.
I really didn't want to waste time there keeping hearing that old lady blaming another family for not filling form completely! Shame!!!<//Review>< name>

I'm indifferent about this place as it's a hit or miss. I like the people who work here as they're nice but it's always crowded, the machines don't work sometimes and the people who go to this place throw their trash all over the place. The mornings and about 4pm is the worse as it's so crowded. It's a tough business though and I give props to the people who work here though. Generally pretty nice and very patient to deal with some of the people who come here... haha!< /Review>

Was looking for a large flat rate shipping box which are normally outside even if they are closed. There weren't any and they just closed at 2:00PM. It was 2:01PM and saw the employee just lock the door and asked for a box and he refused to provide me a box noting they were closed even though there should be a supply of boxes and there were obviously a ton of customers still inside. Terrible service.< /Text>

Incompetent! I asked for redelivery on a day when someone will be home to sign for my package. They deliver it on a different day instead! Called customer service which is as incompetent as the people that work at this place. They had me waiting in line for more than 40 minutes just to tell me they are not able to do anything but document my complaint!!!!! I can't believe our national mail service is this horrible!!!!!!!!!</text>

These people are Rude, Uneducated and have no sense of worth. They could not even help me pick up a package that the tracking number I had showed they had sitting in their facility. Instead they constantly argue with you over moot points.

USPS should just be shut down they are not able to maintain customers. I will never use them again even for a simple letter.<//review>

The owner and staff are friendly and cool.  Great haircuts and they take their time to do it right.  Good music and atmosphere, like you could chill there for hours and shoot the breeze.  Highly recommend!< /review>

<text>Casey is the number one chair and he really shows why he runs the place. The other barbers are all a very close number 2 though. Talent abounds. Less expensive than other barber shops and the quality and conversation at Jerry's Barber Shop is above and beyond any other barber shops. Best place for a men's cut in the area, guaranteed.< /text>< pics>

Topline barbers for adult and for kids cuts. Bella was great with my 4 yr old son and did an amazing job. Cut came out really nice. David did mine and gotta say he has to be one of the best barbers I've been to. Definitely recommend it. Will be back on a regular basis.</review>

Went here, someone recommended Noah so I was able to get a fresh cut from him. Really cool guy with a dope personality. Definitely recommend this place if you’re looking to get a cut around the area. Place is really nice, and in my opinion, they play awesome music. Solid 10/10 in my books, would come again.</text>

<review>Jaime did a excellent job on my cut. The staff are very friendly and safe on social distancing. They do recommend to wear a mask. It's for everybody's safety. I recommend anyone to come and get your hair cut. Believe me. I am picky on who cuts my hair.< /review><rate>5</rate><GmapID>0x80c336e6f8c6da7d:0xb0a6c5c08a834a07< /GmapID>< user>

Old-school, old fashioned, and professional barbers hands down! Manny is my personal favorite, but the whole crew is second to none. I used to have to go to LA to get a decent haircut... not anymore!!!👍👍👍< /Text>

Came straight from Norway, my first time in California. I was not sure which barbershop I should visit but took this one.
I will never regret it!  Fantastic barbershop with excellent staff! They really listen to you and do really use their time to get you want you want! Thumbs up for you guys! if you visit this place, ask for Carlos, fantastic barber!<//text>

Good barber shop regular prices about the same as most usually a 10 min to 1 hour wait depending on when you go in best bet is to go in early give yourself time.. every one ther clips pretty well</text>

The place has some great barbers like Dylan for example. Ultimately though, the poor customer service from most of their employees overshadows some of their most promising ones. I decided to post this review in hopes that they'll seek to improve in this particular area.</Text>

This was my first time visiting. Great place!!  I was planning only buying the homemade cookies, but wander around and few more delicious treats I ended up getting.   Very helpful and sweet sales person.  Will be returning.<//Text>

<Review>Top of the line dog/cat food. & GROOMING! A self wash station is also available.

They’ve got the best raw brands freeze-dried or frozen, and Earthwise is conveniently located near Albertson’s.  Actually, I found better prices here than online and other neighborhood stores.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIdy4C_4_gFJK5bxE4hbAXX2KbCnH-3v4Z7mg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

<review>I’ve been to 3 different self dog wash facilities all similar in price.  I prefer Earthwise because it is always very clean and I don’t feel rushed nor nickel and dimed.....there is one price for wash AND blow dry.  It is convenient and when they had a small problem which was beyond their control,I was offered a compensation on my next dog wash.  THAT is what customer service looks like.  These are some of the reasons I will return to Earthwise over the other neighborhood facilities.<//review><Time>1582077620408</Time><Response>None<//Response><user_name>Pam Laamia</user_name><Rate>5</Rate><gmapID>0x80dafdbcc8e92c09:0x49b17f52160b69a0< /gmapID>< Pics>

The co owner Mike was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He waited for me to arrive there 10 minutes after closing. Furthermore he didn’t try to up-sale me and He advised me of a slightly cheaper flavor. I was buying Primal raw freeze dried food so he mentioned purchase discounts from Primal. Petco doesn’t carry this brand.

<Text>I have now been to EarthWise twice  to bathe my own dog. The store and washing facilities are extremely clean and well stocked. Lorene ,a store employee was a delight to  meet. She was very friendly and treated my dog like a queen , and even lavished her some tasty dog treats!  I give this shop five stars  and highly recommend it.  I encourage everyone to support our small businesses!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Earthwise Pet is the best place in the Desert to shop for healthy food and great supplies for your furry friends! I love shopping here they have all the natural ingredients that our pets need without all the added fillers found in department store brands. Sometimes I bring my dog here and she gets a free treat! This place also has grooming services to pamper your pet. I will always be a customer to Earthwise Pet!</text>

The staves were so accommodating and courteous. They also gave some useful tips on how to take good care of your pets. They are also attentive in answering all of your concerns about my pets. Five stars for you, guys! Strongly recommended!< /Review>

Wonderful experience ordering dog food for my Frenchie! They have great brands and ordering online was quick and easy. I needed it delivered same day, so I called after ordering to see if it could be done. Mike contacted me right away and was such a pleasure to deal with & dropped it off within a few hours! Their communication was fantastic- I received an email upon ordering, when they were on their way to deliver, and after it was dropped off. 100% recommend!<//review>

What a wonderful experience my two pets had today with getting a much needed bath. The environment was clean and friendly. The staff was very helpful, everything was there ready for us to get nice and clean. I will definitely be returning to bath my two babies there.< /Review>

I   had planned on buying my Beagle a nice bone or elk antler to chew on in addition to the other little treats I think he would like to try.

That was by far the best service I have ever had and a pet store. The knowledge and fun personality of Lorene was great. She had so many suggestions for my dog because we just moved out here in my Boston is having a bit of trouble. Thank you for having such a knowledgeable person at your store. I’ll definitely go back!</review>

Great experience! Love Amanda, so caring & patient with my two nervous furbabies and did a great job. The female is afraid of everything  so she cried a lot & probably drove everyone crazy! I will start giving them CBD oil daily to calm their anxiety. I appreciate everyone at EarthWise - seem to love animals.<//Text>

<Review>This is a relatively new place that is filled with happy people and pets. The new owners have made this a great place for grooming and supplies. They are the nicest and most friendly guys you’d ever want to know with genuine enthusiasm for their new endeavor. The grooming facilities are neat and clean and you can even do a self pet wash if that’s all you need. We will definitely return. Thank you!</Review>< pics>

Took my 13 yr old golden retriever to get a good summer cut to make him more comfortable. Not only is he more comfortable but he looks amazing too. Brand new dog. They were so kind and patient with him as well, and gave him as many breaks as he needed. 10/10 would recommend.<//review>

I took my dog there for the first time for a grooming, the staff are very friendly and welcoming. My dog is fearful and the staff took the time to understand what his fears were and also getting to know him. They made a huge effort to help him adjust. They did a beautiful job on his cut and I can say it is one of the best grooming stores I have ever been too. I highly recommend EarthWise.< /Review>

Earth wise is a fantastic pet store! The owner is very nice and informative about the various kinds of dog food, etc and how they differ. He was also very informative about their grooming services which sound awesome and are a much better deal than any of the other groomers in town…That usually don’t do that great of a job as I’ve been to many of them.
I will definitely be taking my pooch to Earthwise for his next grooming appointment and will continue to buy my dog supplies from Earth wise in the future. Highly recommended!< /Review>

<review>do not go!! the one who attends is very disrespectful. I had an appointment scheduled for Monday at 12pm. As soon as I arrived, he told me he did not have my name in a very arrogant way. Very bad attention from this man, hopefully not the owner because if so I do not understand why this place has so many good reviews on google. At least he would have apologized and everything would have gone better. This place does not know how to treat clients in a polite way.<//review>< Rate>

Earthwise in Rancho Mirage is a wonderful place with food and pet supplies. My favorite thing is their grooming department. I have three large fluffy doodles and they love the treatment they get from everyone and always pick up stunning dogs that have enjoyed their special treatment. The owners and staff are welcoming and friendly.< /review>

<Review>Mike, the owner is fantastic!!! My dog is 13 years old, has seizures and has hated going to the groomers. He makes it so easy to drop her off. She goes right to him and his happy to see him. He does a great job with the grooming and the price is fantastic! I would recommend Mike to anyone that would ask!<//Review>< pics>

The owners and employees care and love your pet as much as you do! I’m so thankful to find a great facility to bathe my older lab, which requires some caution due to her hips. I wouldn’t trust just anyone. They stock only the best variety and highest quality foods from raw, freeze dried, and dry as well as treats and supplements and cute accessories! We will be life long customers:)< /Review>

Amanda was awesome! I brought in a picture of a Golden Doodle puppy cut and that is exactly what she gave our doggy, Izzy. We loved her grooming techniques, tips for Izzy (ears & tushie area) and Amanda loves Izzy as well. We look forto our return in December and have already booked our next appointment for Izzy❗️< /Text>

This place is amazing! From the first time you and your pet walk in the door, you are treated with so much Customer Service! They truly care and love all animals.
Jackie and Elodie took so much time to help me find the perfect harness for my tiny Chihuahua Rubie Blu. We are so thankful for you.
Also, the owner cut Rubies nails and did the BEST job ever...all for just $10 bucks!
Great selection on top brand/healthy pet food...
Check this place out...your pet will love you even more for doing so  🐾 💜💕< /Text>

I took my dog, Cody in to be groomed by Taylor. She did a great job. He had experienced extreme stress related issues at other places I had taken him but did just fine at Earthwise. The entire staff was very friendly and patient with both of us. I'm so glad I have a place to take him where I don't have to worry.</Text>

<Time>1531418255193</Time><rate>5< /rate><text>I took my teacup Poodle , Penny in for grooming yesterday .  She looked like a little princess when I picked her up and she was calm and happy sitting there waiting for me so I know the experience was a pleasant one for her.  The shop is very clean and neat and the groomer was so very nice 👍. I talked to the owner about dog foods for my baby who is picky and has digestive issues... she is only 4 lbs... he gave me some samples to take home and try. I also bought a beautiful collar for her.  I'm bringing my Shiba Inu in today to get her nails trimmed and a fancy new collar for her too.
GREAT place and very nice staff💕</text>< pictures>

It's a nice quiet little park just 3-4 miles outside of town. It's very clean and well maintained. There are about 28 sites on gravel. The outside rows are back in, and the inside are pull through. The sites are level and have 20, 30, and 50 amp power. Each site also has water. There is a double bay dump station easily accessible. There is a laundry and shower building just a short walk (~100 yds.) from the RV parking area. They are also very clean.
This is an Elks Park, but non-members can stay for a slightly higher rate. We are not members, and it cost us $25 a night during the off season. Elk members pay $20. During the busy season it is $5 higher.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaQumq5Q-0x_T5_ZmeFKRzu7pb4uJ0G6BzdQoC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7S-aKSMGI82FD8_oCd1N7Iy2tKTL8yNsoIaev=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaGSgMui7bFWRpBX_pbuUphbuVCC_KogBfSWT0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXZpeLrQzhXeQMznMD506jI2E1DxKH69RLzQVa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTHhW8pn5lLrNznb4nT9rUrs90B7cjvA1xYDGH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5gt1uWAcr7tlL51WNhyLplP1pn91Tk7DZXC5X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOizJsVwL0iMrKMtccPC8Q0Cojs13FufabR4-0m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuqrtdW5gRfNbiOOVpl5IIpNBymcGAVcgc-YaC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVU2iPhg24ezmPQNydtbSsUDby_X4P4CibQmnE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I would never recommend staying here, the host would not allow guest to use the bathroom s, shower's or laundry facilities, claimed it was because Covid, it was 112 degrees. Most people do need to use them when this hot. No other place we stayed at did this to their guests for basic cleanliness and bathrooms.  Also our site was loaded with ants, and all the host did was bring a can of cheap bug spray over once, we were all bitten up. When I contacted Mark and asked for a refund, he offered me a free night, like I would really want to go back there, instead of a monetary refund. I would been happy with at least 1/2

Don't stay here it sucks!!

<name>GK Davis</name><pics>None< /pics><review>I quiet campground owned by the elks. If you have the opportunity, I recommend stying here. This campground offers electric and water but no sewer hookup as well as back in and pull through sites that are relatively flat.

I will say the host is all business- not much for friendly conversation. That said, check in was quick and painless. Its an all cash transaction so be prepared when you get there.</review></record>

Good park for reasonable price.  No sewer but a convenient dump station.  The bathrooms and showers were pretty far away from the sites and was told that I'd have to squigee the water if I showered??  Its quiet but a train came thru with horns at 3 in the morning.  I'd visit again.  Beware that GPS is off a bit for the entrance...</text>

MOSQUITO VILLAGE WORST PLACE TO RENT FOR AN EVENT! I wish I could give this place no stars! yea its clean for all the RV people but to have an event its the worst place! We were invited to a party here and my daughter's 9 and 4 years old and myself were bite so bad including everyone else that was invited. MY LITTLE GIRLS WERE CRYING WHEN WE GOT HOME BECAUSE THE BITES WERE SO BAD AND BIG! NEVER AGAIN AND I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE TO HAVE A PARTY HERE AS WELL!!</Review>

<Review>Horrible people to rent from!!! BEWARE!!!Owners are very prejudice against mexicans.They made comments like" your not going to have a mariachi are you,because if you are thats not aloud here"...Along with various subliminal comments.They ruined my friends wedding.They constantly complained about music being "TOO LOUD".Even the bass was turned off.They came over 5 times saying theyre getting alot of complaits from neighbor's(Which was a lie).Constantly breaching their contract.Owner came and turned off the DJ equipment at 9pm,Making threats"if i call the sheriff's they will confiscate the dj equipment(AGAIN THREATING).He told me to "shut my mouth" when he was told hes breaching the contract.The owners wife was spying from rv park and sent a text to bride saying,"i see you have a jump house thats an extra $20.00.Nothing in contract stated anything about that.When bride & grom had enough of their BS they called sheriff out to de esculate the situation.Sheriff stated they got NO PHONE CALLS OF ANY COMPLAINTS.Owner was asked to leave.***HORRIBLE AND PREJUDICE PEOPLE** .We got it all on camera also.<//Review>< resp>

Jerry and Suzie - amazing hosts. They were very kind and modest. The campground is a nice and quiet place a couple of miles outside the Merced town. We had to make an unplanned stop to avoid driving late night towards Yosemite valley, and the Manteca RV parks were all full. The Merced route was much more easier to drive through and lesser traffic on the route from SFO to the valley. If you are driving from SFO to the valley, we highly recommend a stay here. They have electricity, water and dumping station along with bathrooms, and a party pavilion too! All at very affordable rates<//review>

Showers and toilets very clean.
Only cash payments are possible.

Wirklich schöner Campingplatz, alles da was man braucht. Für Abwasser gibt es nur eine zentrale Station aber das hat uns nicht gestört.
Duschen und WC sehr sauber.

< Review>
I give it 5 stars because the people, the service, the place are all nearly perfect. I used this storage for 4 months for my clothes and books. It is very clean, dry, and save. There are no dusts, bugs, spiders, whatsoever. The air is fresh inside the building and there is no bad smells. There are carts for you to use and the elevator is convenient. You can easily access your room during day time and night. It is well lighted in the night. The gate is secured, and the street is save. They response to your question very fast through phone and emails.

The only one thing I would like to suggest to improve is about the metal lock. Everyone need to buy the door lock when move in, which is of a special type, and you need to bring it with you when move out. I do not think the lock can be used for anything else, therefore it is a wast of the natural resources. Is it possible to be recycled and used by another person?

Thank you very much.<//Review>

<text>Great staff, professional through-out the whole process of renting a unit. Would have given 5 stars but the carts provided are old and needs to be replaced.  I just noticed my unit does not have good lighting.  I had to place battery operated lights in the unit.  This place is clean, safe smoke free.  No surprises unlike extra space storage on 10th street.</text>< pics>

As I went around the store, I didn't know what boxes would be best and she saw that I was struggling a bit and assisted me. She is very knowledgable and didn't try to "sell me" on anything which I really appreciated. She endured all my silly questions with kindness and I ended up buying 7 record boxes, tape, 4 medium boxes, bubble wrap, and a bed cover. I feel like I have all the necessary things I need to move thanks to her (:<//Review>< pictures>

I like that this storage is close to everything and you need a code to get in/out. The storage sizes were great but a bit expensive. They can definitely have someone clean the bathrooom more regularly they were always disgusting and when I was moving in I had to go so bad so that was an inconvenience. The staff are very responsive and almost always replies to requests the same day if not the next day. Would use them again for short term< /Review>

My unit was ideally located close to the back driveway making loading and unloading a breeze. Always a lot of carts handy too. The entire place seems very well cared for, clean and well lighted too.

My experience with Chris and A-1 Self Storage was awesome! I have used a storage company before and the staff was miserable to deal with and the lot was filthy. I was worried when I realized I needed a storage company again due to an upcoming move. I was so stressed! But it turned out great! Chris is so easy to deal with and so pleasant! The grounds and the locker are spotless! I have a few nice things and Chris set all my worries at ease! I feel so much better having my items with Chris! It's obvious that he takes very good care of the place and he's great with his customer service! I am very pleased with the whole experience!</Review>

I am quite pleased with this storage facility. The 6-10 access hours are really convenient as well as always having carts available.  I also appreciate how clean the bathrooms are. The bathroom is the best place to determine the cleanliness of a facility! I looked around at others storage places but they just weren't as clean as this one or as convenient.< /review>

<Review>I could write about the many services and reliable security that A-1 Self Storage provides, but you can read that for yourself on their website or Google page.  I would like to comment on their concern for, and ethical treatment of, their clientele.  I have been a customer for over 3 years now, and A-1 has made good on all promises they have made.  Honesty is a big factor in my choosing with whom I do business.  A-1 has not only kept their word, but care enough about their clients to work with them on any special needs that client may have.  Bravo, A-1!!  In a time of corporate and government deceit on an epic scale, it is nice to see a company who puts the needs of their customers ahead of the almighty dollar.  My heart-felt thanks!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

They have really great access times. I work odd hours so I need to access my stuff early in the morning and late in the evening and they have hours that accommodate that. Not to mention, my storage is well lit, which is important for me to find things. So, if you are looking for a storage this is the place!!<//review>< username>

<Text>This is the most customer friendly storage facility you will ever get. Chris is a great … he was very flexible with me changing my move-in dates and was always happy to drop in a courtesy call as a reminder.

After I moved all my stuff in and left the storage facility, I was surprised to get a call from Chris telling me that I hadn't locked my unit properly and it is not fully secure. I went back and fixed the lock. This shows me that Chris really cares about his customers.< /Text>< time>

Hooray! You've reached the end of your search for storage in the San Jose. Chris is so wonderful!

- Flexible, friendly, helpful staff
- Clean, well lit, extra tall units
- Easy, drive-up secured access

I've had several units with Chris over the past year. They've been flexible and willing to switch me to a larger unit when business required me too. They have never charged me for un-used time in a space,  I could go on and on...

Their staff is totally helpful, understanding and flexible- always making sure that the customer gets the most for their money. There's no question- this place is the best! Susan and ManuelUnique Furniture and More</text>

(Translated by Google) They gave me a storage that does not look safe .. the door is wide open on one side and the lock is crooked. Like someone forced the lock and so they rented it to me ..😞

Went to this location 2 times. First time great customer service. Second time the worst ! First of all she took another girls drink to fix and couldn’t wait to make ours first that had been waiting. I waited for like 25 minutes to get my drink and for the girl to only make me 1 drink when I ordered 2. Took up my 30 minute lunch , will not be going back to this location. Honestly worst experience</Review>

Essentially ordered, walked outside, as is consistent with current procedure at all restaurants and sat at a table. The server came out and asked us about specifics on our order on 2 different occasions, then crickets. 20 min later my wife went in and told the server we still hadn’t received our order to which he had a “uh-oh” response. 10 min later a different server brings us our order which was placed on the table reserved for Uber eats. The bowls were completely melted. He said he had a ton of orders so we’d be waiting a while to get it remade without having melted for 30+ minutes. Apparently getting orders correct before moving on to new orders is not part of the business model at this particular location. I asked him if he thought I should just eat it melted, he’s reply was “well yeah”. Since I felt $22.50 was a bit high for acai soup, I said I just wanted a refund.
This is when he really rose to the occasion, and threw my money to me, going all over the counter.

We retired from this nightmare and went to Bowlology for the best service, best bowl we’d ever had.

Being treated well, and working with young professionals that know their product and take pride in their service is delicious.

If the owner does not want to adjust the culture of the employees at this location, I encourage you to use your power as a consumer and give your business to deserving teams that understand the value of a quality product and service, particularly during these uncertain times.</review>< Pictures>

Vacationing from  Texas, I found this place with my sister. I tried some Coconut / banana  drink. It was pretty tasty. I find though there's a small selection, but you can add things to it and different shots: protein, wheat grass..., etc. Good service, nice staff!!!  That would make me come again for sure....🙂<//Review>

What a joke this place is! The portion(s) of the bowl is never the same and not very consistent...sometimes "OK" and most other times the the portion is so little. The service is so terrible and very slow...it takes at least more than 20 min plus for only one bowl. I saw quiet a few people get refunded and left .. for it took after more than 30 minutes of waiting for their orders. The workers   don't seem to have any sense of urgency or  they seemed not well trained to make most of orders...so frustrated with this place!< /text>

What a joke service is awful - 3rd time is enough to never go back.  I get opening weekends they need to get it together even though they stood there doing nothing but.  This morning walked in with 1 customer waiting for drink -after 5 mins had to ask one of the 3 employees to help me.   2 minutes later they come back to tell me a rush order just came in it will now take 10-15 minutes for a smoothly!   Guess my money wasn't good enough so I took it back - another 10 mins for that but will go to Jamba Juice - they like my money.   Apparently they only pay attention to the app orders.  Guess you don't realize people pay for smoothies not apps!< /Review>

I have had nothing but the best experience since becoming a member.  Each representative I have dealt with, especially my Agent Michelle Pappe have been efficient, courteous, responsive and very helpful.  The amount I pay each month is also a plus because it is very very affordable.  This tells me that they care about me, my needs in insuring my automobiles and renters insurance, especially and most importantly the financial part of it.  I am definitely getting way more than what I pay for and for that, I am a very satisfied customer.  Thank you  Michelle and your insurance representatives for making me feel special.  Member for life, for sure!< /Text>

<Text>I’ m pleased with all four selections
I do not worry that I am not covered if I should ever be involved in an accident.
I trust Allstate to be there for me.
I feel Allstate cares about it’s customers.
I feel that Allstate will offer me the best rates for the coverage I need.

<text>Michelle is extraordinarily compassionate, knowledgeable and detailed-oriented. When my 40 foot elm tree fell on my home, she had the tree guys out there within an hour - the tree carted away before my kids came home so they didn’t have to witness the scary sight. She makes sure you are adequately insured, so when disaster happens, you’re covered! She is awesome!</text>< date>

< Review>
Michelle Pappe is the best! She's been helping us for years and has taken great care of us every time we needed help. We have multiple types of insurance under her care and agency, and we keep adding on more because we love her exceptional service. She is quick to respond, personable, always tells us our options and is not afraid to research things for us when needed. She always strives to provide us the best quotes and services. She helps drain the stress out of the insurance process when you need to use it. Finding Michelle as an insurance agent is like finding a good doctor, you want to keep her for life! ❤️❤️❤️<//Review>

The home is in a fire zone and so not many insurers would provide coverage. She presented us with several options and explained what the differences were as well as a recommendation. She kept us updated on the status of obtaining a policy since we needed one as a condition of the mortgage. I would highly recommend Michelle for all of your insurance needs.< /Text>< pictures>

We have received excellent support from the Michelle Pappe Agency.  They have always been available and responsive whenever we have had questions or concerns.

Ms. Pappe is very good with return calls/emails and gives all the information that is needed in an accurate and timely way. She is extremely personable and the customer knows they and their needs are cared about. In an age where you sit on hold with menus that you can't navigate, Ms. Pappe is a breath of fresh air.<//Text>

< Review>
Michelle is the absolute best Insurance Agent I have ever dealt with, honest, to the point and finds me the best outcome every time.
I was new to the USA in 2012 and totally confused, by 2018 I have been through about 4 agents, Michelle, and Allstate are now my only go to agency.   Highly Recommended for sure.</Review>

< review>
Allstate turned out to not be a right fit for my situation, but Michelle took the time to discuss and walk me through my options (even with other providers), far beyond what I could have expected. Will return here when the time is right, knowing I'll get the best service.<//review>

Although it was off-season in Napa, we were welcomed with a very pretty and colorful wall of ivy, along with a glass of their unfiltered Chardonnay. The tasting room was modern and chic and was a great atmosphere. Our host Sean was knowledgeable about the wine, grapes, and more. He also gave us a tour to learn more about the fermentation process and barrels, which was very interesting. The winds were AMAZING and my favorite was the Three Graces.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Beautiful winery and delicious wine! Bill was a wonderful host and my husband and I really enjoyed our time. They took all necessary precautions for covid (seating outside with few people around and the hosts wore masks). We will definite be back again soon.<//text>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><Review>This was my favorite winery in Napa. We were greeted with a splash of Chardonnay before our tasting. Brilliant wines coupled with a finely crafted, personalized guest experience. I was sold. They are nailing the details. Highly recommend trying the Three Graces.<//Review>< Pictures>

This place had some of the best wines I've ever tasted. The tasting room is comfortable and tour was really interesting. The crowd is small and you can get a lot of personal attention.< /Text>

<Text>Very friendly and courteous staff.  The gentleman who provided the tasting session was very knowledgeable of their products.  Building is a little smaller in comparison to other vineyards but very nice nonetheless.  Wines are what you would expect from this region: extraordinary.  Would highly recommend it and definitely worth a visit if you're doing a tour of the region.<//Text><Date>1535733163063< /Date><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

<Text>Regret wasting my time coming to this winery. We did not stay, so I cannot speak for their wine, but we did get told that they were at full capacity when they had over 50% of their tables open. They were very cold and uninviting. The next winery we came to (without reservation) gave us a warm welcome & found a spot to seat us followed by exceptional service. I will definately think twice before re-visiting this winery or recommending to friends/family.<//Text>< name>

Really fabulous wines on a beautiful property. Unfortunately the service was bad enough to cloud our experience - worst we’ve had in 3 days in Napa. Waiter was abrasive, walked away as we tried to ask questions, and short-changed us on last serving during our tasting. Will not return.< /text>

<text>Have been drinking their wines for years. First time visiting the vineyard. This is a beautiful facility! Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and their wines are delicious. Introduced me to my first 100% Petit Verdot (usually just used in blends) and my first Cabernet Franc. These wines were great, I really enjoyed them. One of the only cabernet sauvignons I don't mind paying a high price for, (it is worth it), but I grabbed these 2 wines to add my collection as well.<//text>< Pics>

Their picknic area is under construction but it looks like they have a temporary outside seating area. We wanted to have a bottle of wine out there but were told that we can't do that We were very disappointed. What's the purpose of visiting a winery when you can't enjoy their wine. I would definitely not recommend  to go there.<//text>

<Review>Beautiful space, medium sized wine tasting room with tall ceilings. Loved the outdoor lawn, cabana seats (requires reservations), and picnic tables. Not a huge fan of the wines but was affordable if you can find a 2 for 1 coupon. Most hotels may be able to provide discounts.< /Review>< Pics>

The view is ok. The wines in the cheaper tasting menu are not so great. The experience was like "drink, next, drink, next...", not so much explanation or a place to hang out during the tasting. They do have a cute little picnic yard though.< /Text>

Very friendly and knowledgeable service, and good wines. The tasting is $15 for 3 wines and $25 for 5 wines. They have a fancier, more expensive option too.

The grounds and decor are not as gaudy as a lot of the other Napa wineries, and have a beautiful rustic look.<//Review>

Having loved a visit here several years ago, we came back and serendipitously it was their opening of a lovely new building and beautiful modern patio. Free liesurely tasting on the patio with Nick, who is just the right amount of attentive, funny, and knowledgeable. What a lovely experience! Left with a yummy Cabernet Sauvignon and a Sauvignon Blanc.</text>

I mean the visit is incomplete as long as you do not visit one of the vineyards!  The prices are decent. They offer 3 wines for tasting in $15.</review>< Pics>

Hands-down, the highlight of our day -- Clos du Val offered a personalized experience, starting with a custom-printed reservation card for our table, which we were shown to by a welcoming and attentive staff.  We enjoyed our wine tasting at a relaxed pace on a beautiful sunny patio.  We noticed that a nearby table had a more aggressive agenda, which CdV honored to make sure that the party could make their next appointment.

The wine punches above its weight--it is competitive with bottles nearly twice the price; perhaps being an original Napa winery before the famous "Paris Tasting" transformed the valley explains why!<//review>

As you walk in, you see several canopied seating areas that are marked "reserved". As we found out very soon thereafter, they're reserved for club members, which is a definite perk for becoming a member because it's a delightful set up for an afternoon wine tasting.

Our server was very nice and verbose. He explained the history of the winery and the style of wines that they make. They have several chardonnays, pinot noirs and cabernet sauvignons. I personally don't like the style of Clos Du Val wines as they are very French. I prefer California style. But the wines here are very well made and definitely worth a taste.</Review>< time>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The tasting here is $ 35, and if you buy two, it will be a chara. The range of wines on the list can range from around $ 40 to $ 120. I bought two each with the person I went with, put them in a cardboard box of six and took them home from Sanfran to Haneda. JAL does not have any troubles because it handles them well. Tax exemption for up to 3 bottles per person, but no problem at all, even if it exceeds 100 yen. Because it costs $ 100.

The person who gave me the guide carefully told the noisy Japanese without any disgusting faces.

ここのテイスティングは、35ドルで、2本買えばチャラにしてくれる。リストにあるワインも40ドルくらいから120ドルまでとギリギリ手が出る範囲。一緒に行った人と2本づつ買って、6本入りの段ボール箱に入れて、サンフランから羽田まで持って帰った。JALは、しっかりと扱ってくれるので未だにトラブルはない。一人3本まで免税だが、たとえ超えても1本当たり100円だから一切問題なし。100ドルもするワインだからね。

案内をしてくれた人も、うるさい日本人に嫌な顔一つせず丁寧に教えてくれた。</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0_1PETjTvrD3ifjaOOnAYzEZPJBfwtuAi3O6x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqw-FCRZRlBuNxILoJekhfzSarSya6Aquuubgi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxanO41c47bb0r2lMVf4ph5vczbXGXq5oghZBR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoGvO4IEyFPIJn-YoPYKOtL14eC4k7WsQMH-n2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPacK2Me4s4eo3JC8QvLFEo_7uFv16W3TDBn44w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

<rate>5<//rate><text>(Translated by Google) $ 35 for 4 plus 1 tasting. Tasting fee is free if you purchase 2 bottles. One was about $ 30-120, so I managed to reach it and bought two.

This is a great place to get some quick cash till payday comes . Never a hassle when you coming unless it’s someone new who does know what you need. But aside from that I would recommend you to come and get cash till payday comes . The owner whom I think is the owner is a good guy<//text>

<Review>Great people to help you with all your needs, and the prices are displayed an reasonable. It like walking into a big all sale store. I enjoy coming seeing all stuff I want grab and seeing vintage items. Sale personal items that I’ve been holding on to for awhile they gave me a great deal. I highly recommend this place.</Review>< pictures>

A pawn shop that's actually decent.  I mean that in the way that I don't feel like I'm a piece of meat coming in.  They's always been fair, courteous and just cool about everything, which makes it the best pawn shop I've ever been to. Straight up.< /text>

Had a pleasant first experience here; the people were nice enough and
service was straight-forward and easy to understand. Today was a short visit, but tomorrow I'll have other things to sell.<//Review>

Very good service, they have a very good security method when entering the store since at this time we wear a mask due to covid19, they ask us to identify ourselves by removing the mask for 1 second looking at the camera, for the safety of the store and  We, the clients, have very good service, very good prices, I recommend it, I feel very safe in that place.< /review>

Best Pawn Shop in town! Friendly staff. I was in need of some cash and i brought my Ps4 in. They exceeded my expectations by giving me more money than other pawn shops in town. I will come back to them for sure.<//Text>

Negative experience boiled down to 2 things: apathetic customer service, and unwillingness to break down / explain loan fees.

Walked in (no greeting, just a "Push the door") with some equipment worth over 500, and when I asked what the fees would be on $100, she stated it would be about 30-40 bucks in fees.

When I asked for a breakdown on the fees, the young girl working at the counter refused to write up the loan ticket, and instead told me, "it will be between $20-25".

Maybe she's good at what she does, and was simply disinterested in helping me with the loan. Either way, I walked out with my equipment.<//text>

<text>THIS PAWN SHOP IS THE BEST,, THEY CHANGED THE IMAGE OF PAWNSHOPS.
I ALWAYS GO TO PAWNSHOPS AND ALL OF THEM ARE RUDE AND NOT ORGANIZED. OTHER THAN THEY REALLY GIVE LOW PRICES.
THIS PAWNSHOP IS REALLY GOOD, ORGANIZED, AND THE STAFF ARE VERY FRIENDLY. AND THEY PAY HIGHER THAN OTHERS. I WILL BE BACK FOR SURE :)<//text>< Pictures>

Worst pawn shop!! I baught a computer there for a good price but just didn't need it. so I went to return it they said they don't do returns  not even for store credit even tho it clearly says they do on the receipt. I will never go there again and I suggest you don't either.</Text>

I love this place. I go here all the time. They are really nice here compared to the other pawn shops downtown. Whenever I want a new video game or movie I go here and check to see if they have anything.
My mom needed a new cell phone rather than here old crap one and I got her one from here rather than a brand new on that she would drop and break the first day. Go here for sure.</review>

<text>To be honest, I think the general attitude and vibe leaves something to be desired.  The employees are apathetic, abrupt, and seem to take a little too much joy in being ambivalent.  They seem remarkably ignorant of their surroundings and neighborhood.  One of these aspects alone is a bit off putting.  Put all together you have a place that's distinctly uninviting.</text><GmapID>0x80ea6c0966224af5:0x910cc95bd1faf09e<//GmapID><pics>None<//pics><user>111241374458358690197< /user>< resp>

This pawnshop was very fair when I needed them I went to  many others and most of the times they would offer me more .  I noticed that the interest is the same in all the shops but those people always treated me very fair .  And I have no reason to go elsewhere .  Thank you to FrancisCo  always greets me like family</text>

If you're trying to sell they go online and search for the cheapest offer on ebay and base it off of that regardless of condition gamestop has better trade in deals ...and we all know how bad they are.</Review>

They pay better than any other shop and don't have that attitude like you're a scumbag because you had to pawn an item. This is the ONLY place I will do business with; 100% professional!< /text>

So here's my experience with this place. I'm not angry just disappointed. A couple of months ago I found myself in a bind and in need of some cash. I searched for the best pawnshop and because of the reviews I decided to go with them. At first it all seemed cool but then... I missed placed my receipt. When I first pawned my items the guy at the counter said we could just buy a copy if we lost it. which was fine since all the other pawnshops usually tell u the same. About a week ago I called them and asked and they say it was no problem I could just buy a copy like they originally said. A couple days later I went down there and the owner was ringing someone up and the chuby guy came over to help me. I told him I had lost my receipt and wanted to buy a new one he immediately stated he couldnt give me a copy but he can tell me how much was due and when. I asked him the due date and he said Oct 14, 2016 and he gave the owner a quick look. which I thought was kinda weird but whatever. I asked him how we would take it out without a receipt and he said just come back with the money and it wouldn't be  problem. As it turns out God is on my side because I found the lost receipts. it was actually due on Oct 2 not the 14!!! He straight up lied to me and the owner didn't say anything. What kind of place steals from their own customers!?! Thank God I went back and took my items out today chuby was just sitting there looking real stupid. Also, i cleaned the tv and ps4 and the games myself before pawning them. I like to keep my things looking new. When I got them back he took a really long time to get them and they looked dirty the plastic on the side of the tv was coming off. I never took it off when I purchased it, the games looked dirty and had a scratch. One of the other games was in a different box. They're not suppose to touch your things until it belongs to them. They are such a disappointment. People be careful who you make business with. We work too damn hard to get the things we own so a crooked businesses like this pawnshop can get richer off our misfortunes. Research the place before you do business not everything that shines is gold. I hope this is helpful to someone else out there thinking of pawning there belongings here.</Review>

They give the most money on your pawn than anyone else in town, but one of their employees is constantly trying to screw me over when I come in to pay my bill and I have to call him on it every time! I think he is trying to make a few dollars on the side!<//Text>
