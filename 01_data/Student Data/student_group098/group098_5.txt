I highly recommend this staffing agency if you are looking for a job. They are quick to respond to your needs and all work as a team to provide excellent service! Suzanne & Deb helped me find a great opportunity and I couldn't believe how quick and seamless the process went. I am grateful for their care and positivity. Thank you Express Employment Professional for all the work you did!</review>

The day I walked into the office to do paperwork I was told the job I applied to wanted me and I started the next business day.  This office has contacted me day 1 of the job to see how it went. Have stayed in touch to insure my first week went smoothly. After 2 weeks they still stayed in touch to make sure I was still happy with my job placement.
Never had an employment place care and keep in touch like this.  Perfect job placement as well. I love my job.</Review>< name>

I had the pleasure of working for Express Employment for Suzanne and John.  I had two interviews within two weeks and were offered both positions the next business day.  Suzanne is very professional, she made sure to set up interviews for positions of my interest but also provided other opportunities without being aggressive or tried to convince me but simply provide additional options.  John helped me with the decision making of which company would be best for me.  After I started employment, both John and Suzanne would continue to communicate and made sure I was comfortable.  While picking up my first paycheck, John took the time to meet me in person and congratulate me and continued to be there when I had questions or concerns.

Express Employment on Flanders Drive in Mira Mesa has a feeling of comfort, compassion, professionalism, and it felt like home.  Everyone there has been great, on point, and communication is on point.  I would strongly recommend Express if asked which agency to sign up with.<//text>

I have found Express to be of great value getting on my feet and finding a work family to call home. I moved to San Diego in late 2019 to find work and continue on my career path. I found work with several great companies and have created new friends along the way. And when I was furloughed from a job I finally landed because COVID hit, Express Employment Professionals was there to help me get back to work immediately. The staff is very positive, highly professional and the owner really cares about the team. Don't walk, RUN to Express if you are looking for work and or a career position. My experience has been nothing but positive! Bravo Express Employment Professionals, bravo!< /text>

Once I called the office back, whoever was in charge that day was absolutely so rude to me. Not only did they not have work for me, the lady said we never want to work with you again.

Came as a walk-in and they said they don’t have time for any interviews. I had to give my information, waited maybe like 20 minutes and none of them we’re talking to anybody at all and were just at their desk. Maybe occupied on the computer but an interview doesn’t take that long. Heard the pay is really low and assignment lengths are unknown.</text>

<Review>staff are incompetent. pay is very very low, but you’ll take a job because money is money. communication via email & phone sucks, they do not respond. there are way better temp agencies around there esp. with more decent pay.</Review></record>

supposedly a professional temp agency but do not seem professional at all . a small temp agency thats only willing to help you until it benefits them . they don’t really care about the employees they are sending to their clients . after they get what they want they dont help you any longer .< /text>

Then she said she would forward my resume to a company that she thought would be a good fit. The next day I interviewed for a job, the day after I started. I am grateful Nikki went above and beyond to get me a chance. Not very many recruiters would be willing to so that!!!

UPDATE: I was brought on permanent with the company. The people at Express are to thank and have been there for me throughout my journey. My family thanks you!</Text>< Pics>

Thank you now that I am in this new job I am super happy that I do my job with love 🥰 I am very grateful to express ......

I had a few horrible experience at this location. Sandy has the worst customer service. It was to a point that after being with Sprint since 2002 we finally decided to leave for a better provider. I would give them 0 stars if i had an option.</text>

They are deceitful and commission-based so they will cheat you if you don't call them out on it. Don't be fooled by their nice easy-going personalities. They're thinking about the commission they'll make off you.< /Text>< Rating>

Absolutely love this store! The workers and very nice and don’t try to push you to buy anything, they let you just browse and if you need anything, they’re always happy to help! If you were to buy a phone, GO HERE. I live in a different city, but still drive to this location because I trust this store.<//Review>

I gave them one star because they had no zero selection. The rep was unhelpful and rude. Sprint used to be a good company to work with and now it has become a nightmare. Do yourself a favor and don't get sucked in by this company and especially by this corporate office. They will say anything for business. I am paying off my leases and going elsewhere.<//Review>

Their customer service is absolutely horrible. I swapped to an 11 Pro last week. Since the swap from my XR my signal has been horrible. Average downloads of 2Mbps, and upload of .4Mbps.

If you research online this a widespread issue with 11, and 11pro’s. My satisfaction guarantee for the phone is January 25th. It’s currently January 7th.

This store would not swap my phone because diagnostics showed everything checked out, even though the speed tests showed very low.

They directed me to the Apple Store, so I went. The Apple Store wanted to swap my SIM, and restore the phone as new. Which means I have to download all my apps again, re-categorize, and group everything. They wanted to eliminate software as the issue. If that didn’t resolve the issue they would swap the phone. I was not willing to do this, because if software is the issue, then the issue would have existed on my XR. It didn’t.

Went back to the store, and they said they could swap the phone, but they would have to charge me the restocking fee of $45. I should not have to pay this when the device is not functioning properly.

I chatted with Sprint online, and they are immediately sending me a replacement, and return package, without charging me a restocking fee. This appears to be an issue of the store not wanting this return, and replace, to show up on their bottom line. This is terrible customer service. They will never receive another dollar from me.</review>

DO NOT COME HERE! This store has scammed my family and I TWICE! First, they told us if we upgraded our phone and switched to auto pay we would get $400 in-store credit. We believed them and then found out we were getting billed $30 a month for the purchases we made. A few months later my sister upgraded her phone and FOR SOME REASON they added an extra phone line to her plan and were charging her for it! We have gone in to confront them but they say the employees no longer work there and apologize. EFF THAT! I will never use Sprint again!<//review>

<Text>So incompetent and nobody is held liable for anything mess up they did! No apology even for the simplest mistake they made. We waited more than an hour on a third trip to transfer a phone number to a different phone, only found out the guy reversed the SIM card. Not even a simple “sorry.” We will never go to this place and will leave Sprint altogether when we find an alternative carrier.</Text>< Rating>

We waited at least a half-hour, with no sign of being helped anytime soon. The store was loud, and there was an alarm going off on one of the in-store models, and it took several minutes for an employee to make his way out to turn it off. Only go to this store if you make an appointment, otherwise you'll wait indefinitely.< /Review>

Great experience! I was all ready to buy and learned that with a credit union I was eligible for 100 bucks in accessories per line,  including the one I got for free!  Great CS, but the process of changing carriers and setting up my phones was about 4 hours total.</Review>

My husband's phones screen was shattered. We took it into sprint, they said they didn't have the screens in with it being a new phone. They told us three days to get the screens in. We waited. Three days later we were told they were not in and that we had to wait 2 more days. Nothing still. The weekend goes by and first thing Monday we called.  We were told that unless we ordered them they would not be in. I had to explain once again that we have been waiting on them and that it should have been ordered already and arrived by now. She puts me on hold. They do have the screens! They then told us it would have to stay overnight seeing that it's late and they have a line.  We arrived 5 minutes later and dropped off the phone. They once again told us it would have to wait overnight when we were told twice that it would only take 2 hours. We hit traffic on the way back to pick up the phone and were going to be 2 minutes late.  I had been calling the last ten minutes before they closed trying to get a hold of someone and the phone would ring only to be abruptly cutt off to the elevator music-.-     we are so enraged by this unsatisfactory service from this Sprint store.     The staff does not seem to be aware of the proper procedures for their office practices. It would help significantly if everyone were on the same page.

Update Tuesday morning: we get the phone back without a sim card.< /Review>

I went in last night because I needed to get a new phone because the screen was cracked on my Evo. I was greeted by Michael A. He was very helpful, knowledgeable, and really made my experience quick and easy. I appreciated the fact that he did an analysis of my usage and offered me a different plan. Even though I did not take him up on it I appreciated the effort. I am on vacation here from La.and am very glad that this was not a chore but rather a very pleasant experience!</Text>

This store in Elk Grove has been dishonest with us since we began service with Sprint. We have wasted hours trying to resolve issues with our bill. We have reported this to Sprint customer service and hopefully they will hold them accountable for dishonest business practices. This is just a warning to other potential customers to beware and to not trust what they say or promise you but to get everything in writing.< /review>

I usually never review places. But this has got to be the worst place. Slow service. The staffs are not knowledgeable and does not try to help you. They try to tell you BS, saying this and that will lower your bill. Dont fall for it or you will literally pay when you see your bill. They were not able to explain anything to me or answer my questions. They were deceiving discounts and promos that never applied. Its sad when I can get more answers from workers over the phone in the philipines.  Negative stars if it was an option. Dont waste your precious time coming here. Stay away!< /Review>

They will skip you even though you've WAITED to get CHECKED in and what's funny and stupid is that isn't "checking" customers in helping the employees KNOW whose next in line? Shake my head. These are uneducated employees who knows nothing about the job and employees who gets paid for disrespecting customers.

The lady who helped us on the other hand was also very unprofessional; she was drinking soda in the middle of helping us and giving attitude when we asked her why we were skipped... is that really okay SPRINT? Seems like she had no interest in helping us. Let alone, being there at all! You guys need better training for the employees at this location.

This corporate store is the worst, rude management. Came here with a problem with the phone and told them it glitches intermittently, the so called manager told me to show me the problem while it's happening, I told the idiot it happens Intermittently and since I bought new phone and I have 14 days to exchange it he wouldn't. Been here few other times and they give horrible customer service. Folks take your business somewhere else where you are appreciated.<//Text>

This location is a total nightmare. Buying a car I'm sure is a better and faster experience than going to this store. Staff is soooo rude. Unbelievable. I couldn't believe it. Horrific service. Now I will drive out of my way to go to a better sprint store with better reviews. I can't believe how some places get away with bad and rude service.< /review>

<review>The 1 star is ONLY because I set up an appt & they seen me within 5 mins. Every time i come to this location the staff even the "Tech" are NEVER Helpful. They have such bad customer service. Not to mention the guy i think his name was "Bryan" was SO unprofessional, he was on his phone - texting while I was asking him questions. The answers he gave me were ones found on 'Google'. I do NOT Recommend & will avoid EVER going to this Location.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1523227198567<//Date><response>None<//response>< username>

<review>A couple of the employees and the manager is nice...but this has to do with Sprint being shady. They decided to discontinue selling HTC and funny how two weeks after my phone was paid off it magically shorted out and was unrepairable. When it was only a speaker.  They couldn't replace it with a HTC because they said there were not any that were referb at the time. I was told I can wait but probably won't get one. So after several days, then into a week of having a phone with no way to answer or make calls, I was given one available option,(second option I was told if I chose it, I might not get that either) so I was pretty much forced into a Samsung. From day one it was a problem, freezing, lighting up by itself I had to go through BBB to get them to switch the phone again. They send me another Samsung with has a crack in the camera, so they send me another one it has a broken piece in the screen. The manager from corporate says if I have a problem I have to take it in and have it looked at ..which I've done and the little insurance area told me if I'm so unhappy with it upgrade and by a new one. Why when I just paid several hundreds of dollars for my HTC and have insurance. Give me a phone that works.  This whole thing with the way they shadely didn't tell there customers about the HTC issue. Funny as it is I ran into someone who had the same issue,  having the same problems with the Samsung replacement. Pay so much money for my original phone, to be given a piece of garbage that has issues and was given to me with damage.  Terrible!!< /review><user_id>113491311636435449180<//user_id>< gmap_id>

This staff is ridiculous. My phone wouldn't charge so I took it in. They said "buy a new charger, nothing is.wrong". I've tried all 4 charges I have so I made them look again.....same response. I'm not an idiot, its not the charger. I took it to the store on Calvine and Josh diagnosed the problem immediately! Sucks because the phone is broken but at least I know. The Laguna store is a waste of.time!</Text>

<review>First sprint sucks! They are the worst phone carrier out. This location has the rudest employees and they are very uneducated on there job. Not to mention a 35 minute wait just to pay a phone bill. I gladly paid a 300 dollar early cancellation fee and went to Verizon wireless best decision I ever made!! Also if you dont know sprint does not have 4g they false advertise so think twice before joining sprint or going to this location. Metro Pcs has better service and costumer service than this place< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<text>I just received my replacement phone after my screen was cracked and could not activate it, So i decided to head to sprint for them to help, stood in line for about 10 mins before an employee helped me although he was just standing around, fyi it was not busy. When i told him i needed to activate my new phone, he just said call the number and they'll guide you through without even trying even though when I said i tried that already. Went to Bestbuy and the guy sat down and in 20 mins my phone was up and running. Not the first time Sprint Employee turned me away after being with them for 5 years.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Absolutely terrible service. Take my phone in to see how much it would cost to get the screen fixed. Took and hour and a half to get someone to help me when the place wasn't busy. Once I get to the window and tell them the problem she asks if I have insurance with them I said I did. She said ok so your phones screen is going to cost 100 dollars without even asking to look at the phone!!! Now after this I talked to a rep on the phone and they said that a tech is supposed to look at ur phone and determine the price for you not give a flat rate. Plus the person on the phone said with ur insurance I could send my damaged phone in and back a new one back for 50 dollars. The lady at the store completely failed to mention that. What she did say at the time that I could add another line and get a new cellphone that way... That's how they seem to help you here. They try to find any way to rob u of your money. Watch out for things they say here!!! Liars not helpers out for your money. Including terrible wait time and no one greeting u at the door.1star all the way</review>

Horrible service. Will not even honnor a recall on a phone that is on the SPRINT network. Followed instructions per email and verified in store before making an appointment. Called ahead prior to going in and verified only to be told that they could not exchange my SPRINT device because I purchased it from the SPRINT counter at Best Buy. Wasted my time.</text>

<text>I went in loaded for bear. I have had problems with Sprint dropping calls. Stopped in to have them check my phone all was  well. Went home called Sprint. They SAID that the problem was with the network and that the 2 towers that serviced mare that one was at 65% of power and the other was 45% of power. They stated that they would check into it and get back to me in no less than  3 days day 4 arrived i waited until late in the day and called them. gave them the run down and low and behold they wanted to do all the tests again . 1st my phone . which I told them I had checked out at the sprint store But it means nothing. Then they looked at my records and said for the 2nd time " yes you do have a lot of dropped calls" Then they started talking about service areas. I stated that I was in the service area per their map.. Oh she said. you have to go online and look.. what you maps are not correct? I saw nothing to say I needed to go online?  after a few more minutes of them trying to blame my area and my house and my location  I stated that they were out of contract as my service was minimum at best. they then moved me up the ladder. mmmm bout 5 minutes later another person on the phone ask me the same crap i had explained 3 times before.. i was going to blow chunks about now. Then she says oh I see you have a lot of dropped calls.. phunking wise woman. She then said that they would be happy to let me out of my contract as I was now on the EDGE of the service area and they could not give me the service that i was paying for..All I had to do was return the phone? What I said I bought they phone! I paid up front for the phone and the service and the phone belonged to me. Well long story short. Sprint SUCKS. They play little games  when in fact they need to be honest sooner.</text><Gmap_id>0x809ac789589d4951:0xf0f1e1fcb28715ec< /Gmap_id>< Rate>

This store is very friendly to help. Making an appointment is very helpful and faster to get help.<//Text>

Well......where to start?? Simply the worst network service I have ever experienced.  My contract was up two months ago so I upgraded my phone to the SG S4.

I was told this was the top of the line phone with the most features and the best service (4GLTE).  The employees at the Laguna Sprint store told me the upgrade for the 4GLTE service in the Sacramento area and more specificly the Elk Grove area was to take place in the next week or so.

Here I am 2 months later with the worst 3G service ever wishing I went to my wife's carrier or at least shopped around a little better.  I was a consistent fan of Sprint's Unlimited Package since early 2000's.  Now I'm lucky to get e-mail updates, media is a joke, shopping is a joke, and sometimes I use my work partner's phones for doing work related tasks I use to do on my own.

I contacted Customer Service who informed me there were no specific plans to update coverage to the Sacramento/Elk Grove area; however they are constantly trying to upgrade and improve 4GLTE in all areas........So politicly correct, aren't they?  This is if you speak/understand broken English.

The Laguna Sprint store USED to have some pretty knowledgeable employees that were very helpful.  As of lately I am assisted at the reception desk where I have been contacted by a cocky unexperienced staff member who thinks he has all the solutions and answers.  This is coming from another issue that involved an update which ultimately had to be pushed to my phone from customer service.

My advise is to stay away from Sprint all togeather.< /Text>

<review>Over 2 hours of standing & sitting on a bench, and they finally admit they have to ship it to Samsung because they can't figure out what is wrong with the phone.  The phone is an S8+, but loaner is an old LG that barely gets any internet.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x809ac789589d4951:0xf0f1e1fcb28715ec< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Worst Customer Service, the employees don't reward what they say when they are trying to sell you a phone. No professionalism and they will leave you in the middle if they see a new customer trying to purchase a phone. Looks like sprint has hired them on commission based. They kept on overcharging me for some devices I had never ordered and they refused to refund my money.<//Text>

According to the sales reps here, the Note 7 phones that were released yesterday are on a first come first serve basis. So essentially we can't get a replacement unless we wait like it is launch day because customers that NEED the replacement because they don't have a phone that isn't melted don't have priority over new customers that WANT the Note 7.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Worse experience, this store is a joke, bad costumer service they make you go back a forth a bunch of times to check on the phone as if I had the time of my life to waste on this people, it seems they are there to waste their time while getting paid, had to drive to another location to get help.< /Review>

I waited for 45 min and I left the manager is slightly rude I'd say if you're impatient this is not the place for you , lack of customer service and lack of employees id recommend stay away from sprint over all the customer service plus the quality of the network is horrible I feel like sometimes I don't even have data as it just disappears on me the manager as u suppose his name is Nick or whatever is unprofessional, I waited for 45 min and he attended different customers who came in and got what they came for ,  the manager sags seriously just looks like he can give a rats ass for the customers there's only one employee that stands out she's more professional than the others , stay away from this place , and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way< /Text>

I agree with the comment below this place is terrible its been under construction for the past year the road looks horrible theres alot of trash in the front entering the mobile park abandon work equipment everywhere the management  people don't care also DTS towing always towing cars for no reason people that live in the mobile homes don't clean after there dogs either would not recommend buying here your better off buying in lake forest the mobile homes are newer or the new construction in laguna beach</Text>

<review>Dont let the reviews fool you... Don’t think about moving here they have a contract with a company called DTS towing and they like to come in whenever they please and tow poor peoples cars... especially since we are under a PANDEMIC people are getting towed when they take out their car out to move their other car to go to work.< /review><Rating>1<//Rating>< pictures>

It's nice but... There can be truck-nuts who like driving over everything and revving their engines right down on the beach. Kind of a jaunt to get there too. Once you get past the off road vehicles it can be nice and offers a loooooong beach to walk on. I did not see any bathrooms/facilities. The whole experience was kind of a let down to be honest.< /text>

There are a couple of walking trails that lead through nice wooded areas and on the rare occasion that the sun is out it really is quite beautiful. The only downside to me are the giant power lines running through making an ugly, electric hum just loud enough to remind you that you aren't really in the wilderness. There are definitely better places to enjoy nature in the area.</text>

We didn't really go down to the beach but the larger loop on the map. The trail is pretty simple and there is nothing steep. This is an easy trail with kids. Many different types of vegetation, animals and terrain to check out.</review>

<review>A fabulous stretch of beach: I lived on the edge of the Lake From '50 to '65 and I fished with a Dip Net, dug for Cohog and Razor Clams and fished for Flounder as Lake Tolowa was ready to flow into the Pacific when the sand break was still intact-words fail me in describing its beauty (Hi Ron).</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Tolowa is a great place to hike.  It has a lot of variety from the beach to the forest with ponds scattered around.  It also has an Elk herd of over 100 that you see ever now and then.  It is also the only place I've ever been close to a Porcupine.  Keep you eye out for giant ant mounds as well.< /Text>

It's removed from the mainstream, it's beautiful, be forewarned though that it gets COLD! And quick. Plus, in the summer, the mosquitoes are thick in the trees, the wind is blowing so much and so hard it is probably the equivalent to a windsurfer in their ultimate happy place. It's intense. The only amenities that are available is a rest stop style outhouse. It is way off the main road and you might have a couple of misses at first when you try to find it. Unless you have gps or something like that. Last thing I will add is that it is a historical site in the local eyes as the area between Brookings and Humboldt county are  native american indian ancestral lands with their own history to share that is something that, if given the opportunity to learn more about it from the tribespeople you should count yourself among the very few gifted with the knowledge and should treat it respectfully. That respect should please find it's way into how the protected watershed/wetlands and state/national park/dunes area are treated, as well as our everyday life.< /Text>

< review>
Overlooked by most , this wonder of the area is not given the credit it deserves! Absolutely beautiful! I recommend dead lake early in the morning to see river otters, the loop at the end of old mill rd to the big dune, and the yontucket area (1/2mi walk from the end of lake earl dr) and go to the ocean, the smith or the dunes!</review>

Talk about a sketchy place... It's mainly a place to take a stroll on the beach or hang out. The waves are usually crashing big time all the time. To get go farther down south here you must take some shady gravel roads through the undeveloped area.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>(Translated by Google) The only way from the road leads through the grass landscape through the pine forests on the Elks over to the Indian graves. Then left to the sea and back to the access road. Approximately 13 km for hiking. Recommendation value.

(Original)
Der einzige Weg von der Straße führt durch die Graslandschaft durch die Kiefernwalder an den Elks vorbei bis zu den Indianergräber. Dann links zum Meer und zurück zu der Zufahrtstrasse. Ca. 13 km zum Wandern. Empfehlungswert.</review>< Pictures>

I bought a used Kia and came here to have 2 recalls repaired/remedied. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They were ready to meet with me right at my appointment time, offered me a shuttle to work, and allowed me to pick up my car after the service department was closed. I really appreciate them respecting my time and working around my work schedule. Very happy I bought a kia!</review>

Won't disclose if a $25 part would be covered under your warranty if it failed under any criteria, but can let you know only after you pay $160 for a diagnosis if it's covered or not. So you'll just have to take time off a week in advance, bring it there for x hours, and gamble to see if it's covered. Really good policy</review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Paid $568.50  for service. Which was extreme, but it's a dealership. I expected it. what I did not expect was to get in my car after paying $560 something dollars to find their service people's trash in my car, no plastic on my seat or on my floor, obviously no disinfecting or cleaning even though covid-19 is here and strangers are in my car. Horrible, horrible service. I do not recommend bringing a car here for service. Id even take my warranty work somewhere else.</review>< Pictures>

<text>The service center is very slow, and lied several times about the existence of a extended warranty. And upon evidence of the warranty coverage were forced to honor the extension.  For a week they heald my vehicle claiming to have other vehicles ahaead of mine.
My second interaction was with the parts center which wouldn't do me the simple respect of returning my phone calls or requests for a call when the parts paid for where delivered.
Just a lack luster customer service from a hige brand that i expect better from.<//text>< Pictures>

<date>1621199505787</date><Response>None< /Response><text>Reached out simply looking for a price on one of their new Kia Carnivals. I’ll let their internet service manager, Paul Interrante, speak for himself-

“Make it easy.

For customers who live locally to us we charge MSRP.

For others that are outside our area we have a $3000 mark up over MSRP. “

Hope that clears it up for you.”

Needless to say I’ll be taking my business to another dealership.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

Day 1- ask about battery, told to get it replaced at KIA service center because Costco ones tend to drain when installed wrong.
Told to make an appointment.
Day-2 call to make appointment, service center is close for appointments
Day-3 call to make appointment. Ask if they have battery for KIa Sorento 15, told “of course, we change those all the time”
Appointment day-
“Oh we don’t have that battery and haven’t for a month. Go to Costco or call AAA”
1 star service with a 5 star waste of time. Hope they gave my appt to the other lady complaining.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

My sister bought a kia from camacho motors and decided to get a second opinion on the rattling her steering column was making. “Camacho” was trying to charge her over $2,000 to get it dealt with especially since the problem should have been covered because the rattling started a few weeks after she bought the car . She went to “Rally Kia” and Raul the service manager helped her out and come to find out it was just a $4 part plus the labor that was the cause of this. He had her bring her car in and he took care of the issue and also had her car serviced and washed . Raul is a prime example of professional and hospitable true service . If you go here hopefully Raul is who takes care of you but regardless “Rally Kia” is awesome and i totally recommend them to any one thinking of going to check them out..< /review>

<Review>Very positive experience.  Sales rep Randy was not pushy and was very helpful in answer questions and was very knowledgeable in providing information about different options.  Randy was very polite, respectful and professional.  The cleanliness and good layout of the dealership matched with Randy's work ethic gives Kia 5/5.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1595610887761, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback! we appreciate you and hope to help you in the future!'}</resp>< gmapID>

Dear Quick Lance, please do better on ordering parts for our vehicles. Every time we went in to get our vehicle fixed, they had to reorder the part. I live in Lancaster ca, not a far drive but it's been 3 times now and we had to back and forth from Lancaster to Palmdale in the last three days...very frustrating experience imo.<//text>

Very slow service. Employers are comfortable letting customers wait forever while their car stay in the lot with  no one working on it.
Have had same issues multiple times during oil change work or any maintenance work while I am left Without any update in the waiting room . Never using their service again.<//Text>

I recently had to order a shark fin replacement for my Optima. The first salesman was courteous and gave me a quote. Told me I had until monday to order and said it would be $153.00. I called back on that monday only for a second salesman to tell me the part would be $176.00. I promptly told him I had a price of 153 to which he stated who gave you that. Now agitated I stated your department. He the said oh let me give you the person who helped you. I ordered the part and picked it up the next day. I went in the service department to inquire about what it would cost to have the antenna installed. He asked what my car was acted like he punched some numbers on a calculator and stated it would be $300.00. I turned and began to walk out being I found this Price to be over excessive to which I hear take my car we can work something out. Not sure what your policy is but it seemed your employees are up pricing for themselves. I went to an auto body shop and had it installed for $100. This will give me pause to do business here and to ever buy another Kia.< /Text>

My dad and my husband were going to sign for me for a car long story short I had specifications on what I wanted I also was not blind on the credit we have and knew it would be a long shot, I was dealing with Ricardo and he called me to say he can get an approval I asked him the specifications on that as I didn’t want to drive all the way to Palmdale nor expose my dad due to covid he stated he would talk to his manager and that was Saturday I text him twice to ask what happened or if there is no approval or nothing to be done to let me know, at least respond but nope no answer at all.< /text>

My sales rep Randy was very assertive and found the right car for us very quickly. He also did a solid job of getting us the deal we wanted and the payments that fit our budget. I'd recommend him to anyone considering a kia. Their finance guy john was efficient, friendly, and helpful, and even the GM Paul was a solid 5 star guy. Being as tough a customer as I can be, I'd really like to thank the whole crew for putting up with me!< /review>

The most amazing experience ever... Randy has an eye for the right vehicle, for the person he is helping to find their dream car!  He knew exactly what I was looking for without me saying too much.  He was so helpful in getting me acclimated with my new Kia before I left the dealership, very kind and educated in knowing the vehicles.
George was very helpful, as well. I appreciate him educating me in how to help improve my credit and did a great job in getting me the APR and monthly payment I wanted.
I applaud the Kia Team! Thank you!< /review>

He knew by looking at my boyfriend Sal credit score he was able to determine if he was going to get approved and wanted to help us and make it easy. He was approved and had his KIA Soul in less than 2 hours. Washed clean and full tank of gas. We are so very pleased and will continue to shop at Rally Kia for our next car purchase.

Fortunately, Christian made it painless. I had the keys in under 3 hours! Highly recommend him< /review>

Worst experience ever! I highly recommend anyone purchasing a vehicle from this dealership to have them wash the vehicle you are considering  before you sign any documents.  I Purchased a New 2019 Kia Optima to find out after the dealership washed it for me to drive off the lot that my new car was covered in water spots. The Sales department said no problem we will take care of it. After multiple acid washes, front and back window being replaced  my passenger and driver side windows still have light water spots and the paint is still covered in water spots.  The General Mangers response is they will not be doing anything else to fix this problem.  I Highly recommend purchasing from another dealership.<//text>

It was a good experience, the service was great. But, theres an additional wait time even if you've scheduled before. It would be better to already have cars prepared, so that there wouldn't be a need for delay.<//text>

<Text>Fantastic customer service at this dealership! Friendly, efficient and reasonable service prices. (Especially if you use Kia discount coupons!)  Would definitely recommend this location. Great customer waiting room while your car is serviced too. Clean, ample seating, tv, complimentary snacks and beverages, with free WIFI and recharge ports.  Larry in the service department was great!<//Text>< resp>

Every time I go in for an oil change it takes over an hour. Customer service representative are courteous but obviously commission is a perk that is in addition to hourly pay so beware of all the extras they’ll say you need. I have found them to be competitive with better mechanics in the valley overall plan for a long wait.</review>

March 2019 we had a 10:30 appointment for our 2013  KIA Optimas oil change, tire rotation,and we agreed  to  have the coolant exchange and fuel system service. Was told it would be finished in early afternoon.  We we called and came back twice. We picked up the car at 5:45. They did not do the coolant and fuel system  service  but put on the paper work that "THE CUSTOMER DECLINED  FACTORY RECOMMENDED SERVICE. Lie!  We have purchased several KIA'S  there but not anymore. KIA didn't  call for a service  survey on how they did. I wonder why. This elder service adviser needs to get some integrity.< /review>

<review>I had a credit card company approve financing for a Kia. They were all just as motivated to assist someone regardless of the cost of the vehicle. I absolutely felt that Ed was being at least 95% honest with me. And that's excellent in my book. Ed treated me with respect. My next car will be the Kia Stinger G2. Black with all the fixins'! Thanks, Ed!</review>< pictures>

<time>1560318220272<//time><text>I really like the people and service at Rally Kia.  I just made my 2nd purchase from them.  A couple of weeks ago I dealt with Christian and Jacob for my new car.  Super friendly guys and most of all HONEST people!  At first I did not really want to pay for the extra "audio upgrade" that was on the color car that I wanted so I started to look around outside of Palmdale.  One dealer up'd the price we agreed on and then sold the car the day before I was going to pick it up.  Others would not give me real answers over the phone.  I decided to go back to Rally and buy the car with the better stereo.  I feel that I got a great deal and super service by my sales guys and George the sales manager.  George will ensure that you are also happy after the sale.  It's called customer service!< /text>< resp>

<review>The staff over at Rally is awesome to say the least. They're very knowledgeable and helpful about pretty much every question I had for them. And I can be kind of a pain in the ass sometime. They gave me a great deal on my vehicle. And despite my credit not be in the highest they gave me very fair financing. Almost on par with most Credit Union. As long as you understand the reality that this is a business and they have to make money then you will most likely have a great experience here.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Went for oil change and inspection. Made a 9:30 am appointment. Drove an hour and a half to have car serviced. Was told it would be done between 1 and 2 pm. It’s 3:15 pm as of writing this. What’s the point of making an early appointment to wait around all day twiddling my thumbs for something that shouldn’t take over 6 hours.  I will never have my car serviced at Rally Kia ever again.< /review>

Talked to the sales manager "Idan" this evening.  He was argumentative, rude, and refused to let me speak with his general manager.  Even though my first car buying experience at Rally was good, they have lost our future business.  Spoke with the sales team at another local Kia dealership who is more than happy to help me buy a car for a lot less and was very pleasant and helpful.  If you are in the marker for a new car I highly suggest you go elsewhere!< /text>

<review>Purchased a brand new car there. At 56k miles, the engine started having problems. Took the car back to the dealer due to it being under warranty for 100k miles. The Kia dealership refuse to honor the warranty stating that the engine had slugde inside the engine, and that it was our fault because we (supposedly) did not maintain the oil changes properly. Had to pay $3,000 to get it fixed and needless to say....they have loss a good customer.

So please beware of this problem and when they promise you that your vehicle is under warranty.....because the Big print in the contract giveth, and the Small print taketh away.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Randy Melendez & Rob has really helped us out. They took the time and listened to what my nina and I wanted in a car. They didn't even take lunch until we left. They worked so hard on getting the deal we needed. If you ever need a car go to the Kia dealership in Palmdale!<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>When my family arrived to Rally Kia, we were greeted by a sales representative who was eager to help us out on finding a new car for our family. We were given water for everyone and when we decided to leave to look at other dealerships there was no trying to push us into leaving contact information. We then went to the Hyundai dealership where we had an horrible experience with the sales manager and ultimately went back to Kia where the GM of Rally met us and personally helped us with finding the car perfect for our family. Rally Kia went above and beyond what was expected in a dealership. All the workers were all smiles and friendly faces. I highly recommend going to Rally Kia if you are looking at getting a new car. Evan if Kia is not your list I recommend stopping by if you are at the Palmdale auto mall.< /text>< pics>

Robert from sales is very argumentative, also the managers are even worse. Going in the management office is like walking into a mob boss meeting. Never get straight answers from anyone and it’s never busy there which should tell you something. Save yourself time and money and go to Nissan directly behind Kia to get better deals and respectful sales.< /text>

<Review>Worst Kia Dealership when it comes to service and maintenance. We bought our vehicle elsewhere, but needed fixing here. If your car goes into limp mode (Reduced Power Mode), they will try everything to not look at your car. If you turn off your car and codes temporarily go away, they will not look at your car even if you uploaded the diagnostics to UVO. They will say to not use the UVO app, even though it's your only evidence! Buyers beware! They might be okay on the sales side, but good luck getting anything under warranty fixed here!</Review><GmapID>0x80c259b6527e2ad1:0xbb47aff9dc5886b0< /GmapID><userid>115544685953610958084< /userid><Rating>1<//Rating><Resp>None</Resp>< Pics>

Over the last 12 years Rally Kia has been my go to for any of my car needs. The last few years were a bit rough to say the least. However, I cannot express the amount of appreciation and TRUST I have again with them as they have come under new management.

My 2018 Optima was recently totaled. The interior handled like a champ - 3 airbags deploying and all! Walking away with soreness and only bruises, I was somewhat reluctant to head back to this particular dealer due to the decline in customer service over the last few years.

Making my way in to double check on last minute questions before I headed to a competitor dealer, I was greeted by ROBERT WALLS. I had worked with him once earlier in the year but never saw him again and assumed he left the company. After explaining my previous incidents and issues with Rally, Robert apologized and explained that he would do his best to amend my views and rectify a situation to which I had no fault in. Because of his demeanor and WILLINGNESS to HELP me, I toured the lot with him.

He then had SHAINA, a member of his team, take me on a test drive of a car similar to what I had lost. She was informative and beyond kind. I appreciated being treated like a person, not just dollar signs. Although the drive went well, I remained skeptical and kept "one foot out the door".

ROBERT WALLS came into the office to present a great deal but unfortunately I was still a bit short. He left for a few minutes and came back with a deal that RESTORED MY FAITH in Kia's customer service, rectified the finance issue caused by previous management and HELPED me to drive off in a new car!

Words cannot express the amount of GRATITUDE I HAVE FOR ROBERT WALLS, SHAINA, SANDRO GUZMAN, BRYAN ARANA and the AMAAAAAZZZZZING team at Palmdale RALLY KIA!!!!!! My husband is due for a car soon and I know WE WILL be coming back! I am PROUD to have my 5th Kia and looking forward to my husband getting his 2nd!

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, you guys!!!!!
BEST. EXPERIENCE. EVER!< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
So this place... Where to begin. Bought a Cadenza from these guys in February. Went in looking at a Stinger to begin with. Looked at the numbers and my trade situation. Against my better judgement I did the deal. Mainly because they weren't willing to get to a reasonable place on the Stinger and I kinda wanted to get rid of my trade. So, a few weeks go by and they tell me they need to rewrite the contract because there need to be a service agreement in it. They wanna raise the price of my monthly by $40. I tell them just give me my trade back. They settle on like $10 a month more. Which even then I should have just given them the car back and taken my trade.
Here is where it gets screwy as if it wasn't already. The check for my trade payoff that the dealership sent to the finance company bounced. Yes that's right it bounced. So did the second check they sent to pay it off. I email the owner. I go down there. He says my checks don't bounce. Well obviously they do if the lienholder to my trade tells me that it bounced. So I got to make 2 extra payments on my trade in addition to paying for my new car. In the end they gave me money back for all that. Which is the only reason they get 2 stars.
I have since gotten rid of that Cadenza because it wasn't what I wanted to begin with. That was a month ago. Gave these guys the paperwork to cancel my service plan that they made me get about a month ago as well. They still haven't cancelled it nor sent me a check for the refund.
Other reviews say walking into this dealership is like walking in on a mob boss meeting. They are spot on. There is never anyone there on the lot looking because they don't wanna deal with the tactics sales uses. Once you are in there they will basically grind you down until you submit. Best thing I can say is if you bring a trade make sure to get your keys and registration back as soon as they are done appraising it so you can leave at will. Not sure how these guys are best of AV 2018 dealership.
If you really want a Kia try CarPros Kia. Never had any issues when I bought my Optima there. It was in and out not much haggling at all and took about 2 hours.</Review>

My experience was horrible and down right insulting. A total waste of my time. I would not even recommend visiting. The very next week went to Wokeswagen and my experience was fantastic. I am going to purchase a car from them.< /Text>

Good service but online appointment scheduling did not advise that 11:00 am appointment would extend into technicians lunch hour. A 60 minute wait turned into 2 hours because of lunch.< /text>

They wanted 31k for a kia forte LX base model automatic, they messed up the contract on a rolling deal aka weekend buy when the banks are not open to buy the car for financing, they asked me to come back in to resign a contract for the deal and they proceeded to tell me it was a good deal but i learned it was not and I couldn't back out of since I signed the first contract though that one is voided since the bank didn't fund it. After that they proceeded to use scare tactics to make us not leave the car there.

TL;DR don't buy a car from here they will try to take advantage of you whether you look young or you want a car.< /Text>

Horrible service! They lie about the work they do on your car!! They eyeball everything and expect you to be okay with it. You pay for a service and they do whatever they want. Not caring for your family or your safety they're okay with sending you off with a crappy service being done on your car! For all you know all they do is sit your car there and put old oil on it or don't change anything at all.<//review>

Yes I'm satisfied the food was good & Chile was bomb i recommend & there nice family owned business<//Review>
<date>1619846790803</date></record></dataset><record>
<text>We were there during the off peak time so there were plenty of parking.  Located in a complex with other businesses.  Service was excellent.  I ordered a bowl of menudos.  My son ordered tacos.  Menudo was really good to my taste, plenty of meat, not so much Hominy.  My son can usually eat dozen tacos but since the portion was large so we only ordered 8 tacos and took 3 home.  We also had horchata and it was delicious.  I'm still full from Menudos!!!

<Review>I am from L.A. and my Mexican food ALWAYS has to be authentic! In Lancaster I have been to almost every "Mexican" restaurant and have had no luck since they all cater more of the Americanized versions of the true culture dishes. For the people that are like me and like the authenticity in cultural dishes this is #1 in Lancaster for Mexican food 🙌🏾<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>From a scale of 1-10 these place gets a minus 10. Wont find that real authentic Mexican flavor you craving.  Not only should the cook get fired, the receptionist should pack her bags too. Funky attitude like they doing us a favor... Do us all a real favor and shut it down!!!!!!! Only reason i gave them a start is because it wouldn't post without one. Buy some salt or something with your lame green sauce and canned sauce to dip those so called chips in.<//Review>< Pictures>

One of the better Mexican food restaurants in lancaster. Not an undetstatement either. Good prices and food. Would recommend. I've attached pictures of their most recent menu as of August of 2018. I prefer a wet chicken burrito or a chicken tamal.</text>

<Review>Gave this place a try today and as soon as you walk in the atmosphere is very welcoming. The gentleman who took our order was very friendly and approachable. We ordered for take out, waiting time was reasonable considering the place was busy at the time and there was only one person handling everything. Though we were given the wrong order, and didn’t find out about it until we got home, the food tasted good. Asada burrito was one of my fav, accompanying salsa tasted so much better than in other Mexican food places. Will def. recommend and will def be coming back. Just one one piece of advice though, if ordering for take out double check you have the right order before leaving the restaurant 😉<//Review>< Pics>

I’ve been here a couple times in the past and always loved their soft chicken tacos and Tortas. My family wanted to try something new and they are picky with their Tacos but i told them to try it and it was a success. The place is nice and clean and the lady who took my order was the sweetest! They aren’t pricy and their food is yummy even their hard tacos and Pazole.. My family is now coming back just like i have ever since i first tried it. A+<//text>

Delicious food, great prices, great staff. The food was amazing, they are very generous with the amount of food they give you. Definitely one of those hole in the wall restaurants. Highly recommended!< /review>

The food is real Mexican food. The place is clean and friendly. Only wished the servers would learn what ingredients are on their food. One young female server was not of any help when asked for an item posted on their menu. She was friendly though so it's all good.</text>

This is becoming my favorite place for Mexican food, and their hostess/server Lissette is super nice and her service is fantastic. I've been liking their taco plates, because they dont sacrifice the flavor for the price they offer. Will always come back again.< /text>

Worst customer service today for breakfast, we came in and someone just dropped our menus on our table without saying hello or even eye contact, then came to take our order and before we got to say anything, he said"u better hurry up cause we have 10 people ahead of u waiting for their order, so if u don't hurry up and order it will take even longer". After that we walked out which he had no problem. We ate here before and the food is good , but after this horrible customer service encounter, we will never come here again!</Review>

I have been to Burrolandia twice. I had the "lunch special" tacos both times. I know I should have tried something different the  second visit, but I like these tacos ! The service was excellent both times. Not a fancy place, but I would definitely go back.<//Review>

< Review>
I may never cook again!  Family of five had a meal within $40 and totally satisfied.  Great meat selection, we had carnitas, asada, beef, chicken-all tender and hot hot hot.  Have seen so many medics come through here since it’s near the hospital they seem to really like it.  Call in your order and it will be ready for you to pick up.  This cook doesn’t mess around!</Review>

Great place! Authentic Mexican food. The carne asada is some of the best here. Their fish plate is huge! Carne asada fries are amazing! The employees are super nice, very attentive. One of my favorite restaurants in the AV.</Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>I like coming here most of the time. But today we spent over 25 dollars in food and the service was terrible. The lady at the front had some type of family come in after we sat down at the table. We asked for more chips because there was a burnt French fry in it, she said sure never came back. She kept goiin to the table where she had family refilling their cups several times b4 she even thought to come back to our table which she didnt. We literally had to get up and refill our own drinks get our own refill of chips and its never been like that b4. I'm also disappoint at the fact that they made us pay b4 sitting down while everyone else in the establishment paid after the were fat and full. I would recommend they treat everyone the same because if the relied upon family to pay the bills they would be shut down.</text>< Pics>

Great hidden gem.. I've driven by alot of times it's in a odd section of town to me.  Near the hosptial across from av lung clinic. But breakfast was all like home made fresh. Not fast pre cooked stuff.. but like dozen eggs and fry one or 3 up at a time. Portions are shareable.. but the flavors are so good I've ordered 3 types of food and got over whelmed that I took 2/3 home.<//text>

If you're looking for really good Mexican food, this is the place to try. Our family always orders the tacos. Prices are decent and the staff is very attentive. There is no other place we would go to when it comes to Mexican food.</Text>

Came in around 11am it was already hella packed. That's a good sign. Now I'm assuming they take orders over the phone so that adds time to waiting. I got a plain Burrito de asada and it hit the spot. My brother got the menudo and it was also good. Will be coming here again.<//review>

<gmap_id>0x808327bf3d5366f9:0x494b95247dbb11b9< /gmap_id><Text>I like the workers at Trailblazer Pet Supply. The one woman I talked to has a very upbeat personality. My dogs were out of their food and they're the only pet food place that carries the brand I feed them anywhere near me. I normally order their food on line but it was late getting delivered. I got to the business with only a minute left and they let me get the food. I really don't like having to give the dogs other food, it gives them upset stomachs. I was very happy when I was able to feed them their usual food and not worry. I recommend this place.<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

The best! I love shopping here for my pet's food. The frozen raw selection is excellent especially and is what I recommend for starting a complete species appropiate diet for your felines and canines.</text>

They only stock the best brands they know of, and were super knowledgeable when answering my questions. They also have stamp cards for food, which I think is amazing since I'm going to be buying food every month for animals whole life. They have lots of sample packs of food for your animal to try in case they're picky eaters like mine are. My dog is very shy and skittish, so I was worried about her nail appointment. The environment and staff were so friendly she had no trouble at all and actually socialized with everyone. This business helps me treat my animals the way they deserve, like family.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

In looking for a new food for our Yorky - my husband called & spoke to a young lady Who gave him a lot of great information. I not knowing he called the store - researched the same basic information as he got from her but it took me about an hour on the Internet to draw the same conclusion. Down to Trailblazers Store we went- the staff immediately greeted us & told us to look around. If we have any questions to please don’t hesitate to ask them. After husband & I walked up & down a couple isles & talking one of the female staff came over to offer some expertise on product. Not only are they Nice but very helpful & knowledgeable and we like the information/ purchase system they have on computer. We’ve been back 4 times for more food for our furry kids. Thanks again - The Rizzo Family<//Text>

I came in to ask a couple of questions and the girl(with blue) hair couldn't answer so I then asked to speak to the lead and she responded with "we are really busy at the moment come back Monday through friday" but did not answer my question of when was least busy to come by or who I could talk to and let me just say there were only 4 people in the store.  She had Very rude customer service and was no help!. Store did have quality supplies but service was rude!< /Text>

Allison went out of her way to find me on Facebook and message me to find out what kind of haircuts I’d done in the past so she could make Ana’ali the Goldendoodle look her best! She was so kind and thoughtful in all of her messages to me and even kept me updated on the groom which I couldn’t have been more happy about since this was a dear client of mine. My client could not have found a more caring groomer and I would recommend Allison to everyone if I could! She really went above and beyond and we need more people like her in this world! ❤️👍🏼😊</Review>< pics>

<review>I took my labradoodle in for a haircut for the first time since I've had her and they did so great! I was nervous because when I first got her the haircut she had was so bad.. My  husband showed them a photo and they gave us exactly that! We will be back! Thank youuu<//review>< Date>

Owner is super friendly and the crepes were excellent - and very reasonably priced. I love that it is next to the Honda Service Department. Waiting for my car will now be more enjoyable. It's also right across from the East Bay Nursery!!! Get a coffee before you walk around and look at the plants.<//Text>

I've tried their crepes and their sandwiches, and while both were adequate, neither was particularly great, and there's a lot of great food nearby. I don't recall the crepe in detail, but the avocado sandwich was basic, on white toast, and felt more like a snack than a meal. To be fair, the price was modest too.

I'm living less than a block away, but I rarely go here, because I've always come away underwhelmed. I'd go again if invited by a friend who likes it, but otherwise, probably not.< /text>

Food was really good I had the chicken breast omelet and highly recommend. However, this place is a one man show. Took a while to make the omelet as he had to take the orders make coffee and cook. In addition the kitchen did not look too hygienic. He handled money and touched the food without washing his hands, and dropped a spatula and used it with only a quick rinse< /review>

I had a savory breakfast crepe here and was impressed with the generous portions. The place is small inside,definitely cozy with just a few tables. If it's warm out there are a few tables outside. Other customers seemed to be regulars and were very friendly towards one another<//Review>

<Text>Alfonso is very sweet and makes the best crepes I've ever had. My favorite I'd savory Florentin. It is only Alfonso and his son so you might wait a little for your, but it is well worth it!</Text>< Date>

Cute indeed.  Isolated small little building like in a parking lot between two buildings or something looks like could have been a gas station mini mart before.  Alfonso is nice and I love his accent.  Had two things there so far: breakfast sandwich and pastrami sandwich which were surprisingly similar.  Both panini style with red roasted peppers, pesto, and melted cheese.   Doesn't seem to get busy.  Lovely outdoor seating.< /review>

Had a great cortado and talked to the owner of the cafe for a good bit. I recommend going for a quick coffee or bite of food!<//Text>

Hand made, flavorful creations. Quaint little cafe, serving homemade food. Crepes are amazing and there is a good variety of both savory and sweet options. I had the avacado crepe and it was delectable.< /Review>

First off, delicous and friendly.  Don't expect anything fast.  Most things are scratch made.  I forgot how good real eggs are vs thst instant egg batter most places use.  I have never been in a place that made me feel more like I was in my grandparents house getting a custom homemade brrakfast.

Portions large, taste excellent, and prices  LOW.

If you have time to wait,  RECOMMEND, RECOMMEND, RECOMMEND!!!< /text>

A tiny café with so much charm! A very family oriented staff who's always cooking awesome homestyle food. Came here for a crepe (perfectly cooked!) and an Italian soda in a cozy little breakfast house, stayed to chat with the owner and his son for a while before continuing my day. A really nice treat, and much more than I expected from an unassuming little café hidden on San Pablo. Definitely coming back to support them, and you should too!< /Review>

So I decided to give this place and try and just like that, I found us a new Place to visit often. Was more on the pricey side, but the food was really fresh, and very good. Unfortunately the crab fried rice was out of hand for the price, so we didn't get to try it, the Thai tea had a spin on it with whipped cream but none the less very delicious. Definitely give them a try if you want to taste a dream come true.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOu_9P1yRsNeK3IRBrgH9D10G2oaguLw4OOscXz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbGrlF1YDr9RpxoboXoBRTMXsKobqKW1XyPCku=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dca8a7fb607355:0x9dbbf88cc558fcf9< /gmapID></record>

Pad Thai “glass noodle”. The noodle is much thinner. The flavor is a little tangy but addicting. Highest recommend. The garlic rice is really good as well. Not too much garlic, just a hint. Their orange chicken is fantastic as well. Really easy to find something delicious here. We also get the fresh spring rolls. They are not fried but wrapped in rice paper I assume. Comes with a sweet peanut dipping sauce. They also have very good tea. The service is attentive and friendly. Great for the family, friends  or a date. A must try!</Review>

This includes soup or salad, and a dumpling; brown or fried rice instead of white for an additional $1.00. The meals were delicious: absolutely spot-on from the sauce to the presentation. The service was fast and friendly.</Review>< Response>

Me and my Lady are huge fans of Thai Food so we just had to stop, well worth it and the service was great. We ordered spicy green beans and chicken with sticky rice on the side and I would definitely recommend  it (Pad Prik Khing) if you like fresh vegetables stir fry  and spicy food check this place out :)< /review>

Excellent food and prices.   Everything great with the exception of service being a bit slow.   Otherwise perfect. Had a nice family style meal.  The calamari appetizer was fantastic, savory pineapple fried rice, rich noodles and perfectly done mixed vegetables finished off with mango and sticky rice... so delicious.<//review>

<Review>The food is great - a great mix of pizza, burgers, and a must have BBQ pork sandwich. With 6 handles of local beer, wine and bottled beer available I say you can't go wrong at Woodfire Cafe.Walking in you are instantly hit with the smell of pizza. It's a small cozy place and you can see pizza dough being thrown up in the air. We were quickly sat down and the menu is great.</Review>< pics>

<Review>They don't follow directions. I asked for no tomatoe. Not only did they put tomatoe they put it under the rice. They also put extra tomatoes. Food is good but they do what they want.< /Review>< userid>

My favorite Thai restaurant ever. It's a very elegant place, lovely customer service. The food is extremely delicious and their Tom Yum soup is the best I've ever had out of all of the Thai places I have been to. If I could come here every weekend I would. I definitely recommend this place 100%√</text>

Thai Garden restaurant is amazing. The food is delicious and the service couldn't be better. The food is always fresh and innovative. The owner Pitt always comes up with a great dish for the daily special. In addition to everything being great the owner comes out to sincerely give welcome. The cook and the servers are the same and give a hearty welcome. I would recommend Thai Garden a hundred 100%< /text>

Food was good but customer service was awful. The employees kept making rude comments like "you should've called in your order, its late" and when I was offered a second cup of coffee and I said yes she replied "oh now everybody wants something from the kitchen" then laughed like it was a joke. I understand we got there 30 min before closing time but the comments are unnecessary. Good thing there's other Thai restaurants in town! Good Bye!< /text>

The food is tastes really good and the veggies taste fresh, when you crunch into them they explode with flavor.  I would recommend.</review>

If your looking for either Chinese or Thai but preferably Thai you will totally enjoy it. Tasty good, very clean place and totally helpful and friendly servers.

If you need help making food decisions and you will they are great in describing and helping you select dishes from rice, noodles and main dish.< /text>

More people need to know about this place. My favorite is the chicken curry. I really like how non of their food is overtly sweet like many other Thai restaurants. Also they have comfy booths and friendly service.</Review>

I was pleasantly surprised the first tome I visited this restaurant, looking at it from the street, you would not expect what is inside, it is a peaceful ambiance as soon as you walk through the doors, the servers are soft spoken, which it goes with the ambiance :)  the food is delicious, it is not greasy and the sauces are not heavy, I do not drink sodas, or sweet drinks, so I ordered a coconut water, which they serve on the actual fresh coconut. it was amazingly delicious, and after I was done with the water, I scooped up the coconut meat, it was so fresh, tender and creamy, their pineapple fried rice its delicious, I also recommend the kung pao chichen level 5 (spiciness) I love it spicy, they also have great weekdays lunch deals under $8, I highly recommend this restaurant, I just gave it 4 stars, because there is always room for improvement.  over all GREAT EXPERIENCE!</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The soup was delicious but the waitress who served us was too distracted and it took more than 30 minutes to serve the chaow meen that we ordered and to top it off it was not what we had asked for.

(Translated by Google) I ordered a few Noddles with extra shrimp ... for which I paid $ 3.00 extra, which I consider reasonable ... But my surprise was that it was three ... yes, three shrimp .... Three shrimp .... AND The Noddles were smoked .... So I paid over $ 40 for three courses .... I guess it doesn't matter the price ... What matters is the very poor quality and very theft.

Pedí un unos Noddles con extra camarón ... Por los cuales pague $3.00 dlls extra.lo cual lo concidere razonable... Peroooooo mi sorpresa fue que fueron tres...si tres camarones.... Tres camarones .... Y los Noddles estaban ahumados.... Así que pague más de $40 dlls por tres platos.... concidero que no importa el precio... Lo que importa es la mala calidad muyyyyyyy malo y es un robo.< /Text>

This was my first visit  but heard many positive things about Dr. Smith's Office.  Very clean, very welcoming and very professional.  Once inside my appointment went well.  I was informed about the process from A-Z. I look forward to my next appointment.  I advise anyone who needs dental work and has been looking for the right fit, make yourself a consultation appointment...and then spread the good word!< /Text>

My husband and I have been going to Dr. Andrea Joy Smith for over 20 years. Not only is she a great dentist, but she's a wonderful, kind person. She went out of her way to help our elderly parents feel comfortable in her office. We would highly recommend Dr. Smith and her staff!</Review>

Dr. Smith is an excellent dentist who puts you at ease and makes sure you understand everything. Her staff is friendly and professional, and take the time to explain each procedure. I highly recommend her! They are providing quality service at reasonable prices.< /review>

<UserId.>105936054265151657932</UserId.><Name>Tony Torres</Name><Date>1620784419105<//Date><Rating>1</Rating><text>I feel the dentist is extremely busy.  She needs to bring on other dentist,  or take less patients so we can have more time to be consulted.  This is a major life changing procedure,  and to walk in check my teeth, and walk out and have someone else bring the estimate for the procedure did not make me feel comfortable.  I don't think she will allocate the right amount of time for the procedure.   She will probably rush it, and I'm not comfortable with that. Some of the equipment was a bit dusty, and dirty, and  the cost was a bit more expensive than what I was anticipating.   I found a dentist that will do implants for $3000.00. I was being estimated $2600.
Not impressed,  but more importantly,  I just didn't feel comfortable.< /text>< Pictures>

I have been going to Dr Andrea Joy Smith for several years now and I’ve never had a better experience from the moment I walk through the door. Everyone is friendly. I’ve never experienced such a caring Dr. she explains everything in detail and ensures that I understand. She definitely has the compassion and kindness that anyone who’s uneasy about the process. I don’t live in the area but I drive without hesitation. I highly recommend. My smile has never been so beautiful 😃< /text>

<text>Coming to Sacramento from Reno wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be.   Moving up the road from Dr. Smith's was meant to be,  I only had to drive down pass her office.      After a couple of visits,  I wasn't sure until Dr. Smith stepped in and put her experience, compassion, knowledge, and most of all understanding of ones reluctance to Dentist making me feel comfortable.     In my seasoned 64 years I'll have to say Dr. Smith is without doubt #1 in my orbit.          Thank you.

<Review>Dr. Smith and coworkers were very nice, courteous and thorough with the work performed. I would have given a 5 stars, but I could not find parking until someone left the premises. I did have to wait approximately 45 minutes before being seen, but my appt was well worth the wait.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I had my first visit with Dr. Andrea Joy Smith. I have had a missing tooth for about 5 years. I had a partial retainer & it was thrown away by mistake. I watched a YouTube video that Dr. Andrea had posted on her website. I felt at ease after listening to her explain mini implants. I was able to get a visit within a week. The staff is great! When I finally met Dr. Andrea, she was the sweetest dentist EVER! She put me at ease right away & told me that she could do an implant. I was so happy. So glad I made an appointment & I can’t wait to get my implant.< /Review>

I would recommend this office because of how hard they work to make sure their patients are happy.  The Dr. Smith goes beyond to the call to make sure of this.  I am always impress of how long her staff has worked for her, that really says a lot about the Doctor.  When you get to know the staff, they are all very kind and professional.  Can only give a five star and nothing less.<//review>

Dr. Andrea Smith is truly the best that there is! I had been in desperate need of implants for over 10 years and simply dreaded it. But immediately upon meeting Dr. Smith who has the most endearing and warm spirit, I felt relieved and unafraid. Needless to say, I received my implants and the procedure was seamless. Felt 100% the very next day with no swelling or pain and, of course, a beautiful smile. It was truly a miracle! Highly recommended to anyone worried about dental surgery. I promise you won't be disappointed!<//text>

Dr. Smith really cares about the end product, how it looks, how it performs and listens to the patients concerns.  I am in the process of full mouth dental implants and have had no real pain and the temporary teeth are some of the best teeth I have had in a very long time.  I am looking forward to the finished product.  Yes I would recommend her as the best dentist I have ever gone to.<//text>

My visit with Dr. Andrea Joy Smith yesterday was exactly as stated in the positive reviews that I checked out before setting up my appointment. Her staff is wonderful and very attentive to you. She seems very genuine down to earth and professional. I am happy that I was able to connect with this wonderful Dental Association. I'm looking forward to some great results and happy with my smile:)< /Text>

I have received great care here. I have had short wait times to get appointments and into see doctor quickly. Even though my initial implants were not provided here Dr Smith has given me great follow up care and improved on some of the initial treatment. I would strongly recommend her to anyone looking to improve their quality of life with implants.</review>

Ive been going to Dr. Smith for at least 10 years and she is the best! Shes very knowledgeable in her profession and has done extensive dental work for me, including 4 mini dental implants, which is definitely her specialty:-). Additionally her staff is so awesome! I refer all of my friends and family to her and I believe she is the best choice if u are searching for a dentist in the Sacramento area</text>

My girlfriend recommended Dr Smith to me.  At the time my mouth was a mess. I never really smiled much. Through time and numerous visits I can say I do smile now thanks to the professional work of Dr. Smith and her staff.  And speaking of the staff they are the most helpful group of people who do a service for others that I have come in contact with besides my regular MD. I highly recommend Dr. Smith to anyone needing dental services</review>

I discovered Dr. Andrea Joy Smith one morning  watching TV. After watching her explain about the implants I was so excited to go in for a consultation! I didn't wait long before being called back which is always nice. Everything was clean and accessible for patient care and I was treated like a VIP the whole time. Dr. Andrea is very knowledgeable and therefore explained everything very clearly. Once I had the procedure done, staff checked in with me several times after going home. I really appreciated staff being so attentive to my recovery! I followed the aftercare instructions closely and recovered just fine. I really appreciate the excellent treatment and great experience with Dr. Andrea and her staff. I've never been so happy to go to a dentist appointment! If you're considering dental implants or any other procedures the office offers, I highly recommend seeing Dr. Andrea Joy Smith. Thank you Dr. Andrea!< /Review>

I switched well over a year ago. The office promised follow up calls after meds but did nothing. Had to have a root canal re-done and my partial was poorly manufactured. This doc is way over worked. Go elsewhere.</Text>

As ever Dr Smith was amazing. After my husband suffered through a botched surgery at a different dental practice this morning, Dr Smith was kind enough to fit him into her schedule and accomplish what should have been done during the first dentist visit. Dr Smith was gentle, efficient, professional, and she’ll be the only dentist he goes to from now on. Thanks to her wonderful staff and her brilliant and kind practice it’s the only dentist I would ever visit either. And I suffer from a serious dentist phobia. Dr. Smith and her staff are the only ones who alleviate my fears. Hands down this is the best dental practice in Sacramento.

Follow up for 2/12/2020
Since Dr Smith is concentrating on her implant patients she has now hired a new dentist. Her name is Dr Basrai and she is very knowledgeable and gentle. I’m extremely phobic when it comes to dentists but she put me at ease. She is very thorough and I highly recommend this dentistry!
5 stars once again!< /text>

Dr. Smith and Annette  are a dynamic dou! Let’s start with Annette as she is vey kind, knowledgeable, and has good energy! But more than that, she is amazing at her job! My teeth still feel good. I’ve never had my teeth polished using her technique but it was very effective and there was no pain involved! As for Dr. Smith, she is a very pleasant and skilled dentist with a gentle touch. Also, I appreciate her explaining what’s going on with my teeth and acknowledging my efforts to keep my teeth and mouth healthy! More importantly, I never feel judged and she does not try and up-sale her patients!  Lastly, Dr. Smith utilizes the latest dental technology, the wait time is minimal, and the office is very calm and inviting! I can’t wait for my next scheduled cleaning! 😊</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Dr. Andrea Joy Smith has provided my dental care for pass several years, and mostly I appreciate the improvements I have thus far experienced. I believe that there are a lot of people being processed through for services, and  more than a few times it seems things are not completely given clarity such as what next steps will be, is my dental care in final stage or are there more steps to complete, just this week one person said one thing was to be checked, and in came another person  and said okay..you can leave now. Additionally, why is it I paid for services completed, and my insurance paid for same services in proportion.  I'd like more clarity in process... that's just me...so I can realize what I'm doing and what they are doing as well.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>This appointment was a special experience to the continued professional quality I have grown use to from Doctor Smith's office.

The payments and payment schedule were manageable.

The pre-procedure orientation was explained and understood.

Sedation was introduced and applied.

The procedure was completed and explained with clinical care.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Dr. Smith is without a doubt the best Dentist l have ever had. She is knowledgeable, gentle and just a great person to be around. Didn't know that going to the Dentist could be this pleasant! The entire staff is so helpful and cheerful. My Keyhole surgery was a great success. Highly recommend it!< /Text>

<text>Having waited 1 he 25 minutes I was finally seen. After a 20 minute assessment was told that I would be a great candidate for the pinpoint him procedure. That I could expect to see results. A financial statement would be calculated. The cost to my 2 insurance policies would be$4000.00 which would leave me $4000.00 out of pocket or more if I went with Botox injections. I called the office to see if they could just do the upper quadrants for the $4000.00 of insurance
Or would I still be obligated to half. I never received a call back. I really don't feel comfortable with the disorganized quality of this office. Not what I am looking for in a professional organization.<//text>< username>

<review>I lost my upper teeth in an accident in my 30’s and it was truly one of the worst things I’ve been through. I had a bad experience a few years back and I was worried that implants were just not going to be an option for me. I was convinced that I would just wear a denture for the rest of my life. I met Dr. Smith after seeing an ad on TV. She took care to ensure that I was a good candidate then explained the process to me thoroughly before I made my decision. The staff helped me figure out the best treatment plan for me based on my needs and my wallet.

A full replacement of my upper teeth was more expensive than I really wanted to pay but once I compared the cost of mini implants to regular implants, I was convinced it was worth it. I decided on the nicest material because I really wanted them to look natural and stay with me for a long time.

The process wasn’t perfectly easy, there was some problems with my temporary bite and it caused some extra visits. My temporary broke on Christmas Eve and I called the answering service. Someone met me at the office within 30 minutes and spent hours fixing my temporary and ensuring that I could eat Christmas dinner with my family. It was a huge deal to me. I chose sedation for the initial procedure and it was way easier than I thought it would be. Pain was minimal after the procedure was done on Saturday I was back at work on Monday.

After about 6 weeks from the start I have the kind of teeth that people notice and make comments about. Teeth that I can actually eat with. I am so proud of my new smile and I actually open my mouth to talk.

Anyone can write a review about their dentist but Its impossible for me to express exactly what this process has done for me and how well I have been treated by everyone at Dr.  Smith’s office. I still get emotional just thinking about where I started and where I am now after just a couple of months.

I know this is your business but my wife and I will never forget what you have done for us.

While it’s way to early to tell if the PST will deliver the desired results, I couldn’t be more pleased with Dr. Smith and her staff. Dr. Smith goes the extra mile. She helped with reducing some cost when she didn’t have to. Something my personal dentist of 35 years or so has never done, that I can recall.
I felt that not only was I going to a very good dentist, I met a new friend. Her staff was great and helped make me feel at ease. I only wish her practice was closer to home.
My wife who went with me and is in need of an implant was given consideration in the form of X-rays and evaluation at no expense to us.
I would highly recommend Dr. Smith to anyone in need of the many procedures she can provide.
We also met her husband who drove us back to the motel of which I remember little if anything. Being from the same state, he took the time to introduce  himself prior to my PST and implant which was done during the same time frame. I had very little pain and really think I didn’t need the three Advil I took afterwards.
You can’t go wrong if your in need of dental services.<//Review>

Dr Smith goes beyond the call to make sure her patients are happy.  The fact that her staff has been with her for years says a lot about the kind of person she is even as an employer.
My experience is always good when I come in.< /review>< pics>

I really like Andrea I feel like she really wants to help me. I am on a tight buget and if I am understanding everything and my insurance I wont have out of pocket costs or at least it wont be much. She understands that not everyone can afford a full mouth of implants. I wish I could tho.</Review>

Dr Smith and her team are the best! We are never waiting more than 3 mins to be called in. My 11 year old doesn't love having her teeth cleaned but she is not afraid of the dentist like many adults I know. This is because of Dr. Smith's warm demeanor and gentle touch.< /Review>

Dr. Joy Smith is an a amazing dentist.  She was able to place an implant with success in an area of my mouth that a previous implant from another dental practice had failed.  She really cares a great deal about her clients.  They are a very busy office but I never feel like I do not know what is going on.  There can be a wait at times but because of the deep knowledge, years of experience and great care Dr. Joy Smith has taken with me I would highly recommend her services.  Hope you find her to be as great a dentist as I have.< /Text>

Sandy from the front office was welcoming and friendly and Jacky, the hygienist was competent, gentle and concerned if I was having  any pain throughout the cleaning process. Dr. Andrea is a very nice person, friendly,  knowledgeable in her field and very easy to talk with. She answered all my questions in a easy way to understand (showing some pictures and explaining some brochures) about futures treatments options that I want to have done in my mouth.Overall I was very happy with my visit.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I was seen very quickly ! I love the atmosphere and the people were very friendly!    Prices are just right and financing is available 😊  My whole life was changed!!!   Nothing is more important then a first  impression!   I was so worried about what people thought of me because of my missing teeth.  Now I don't have those worries anymore.   Thanks Dr Joy Smith !!!    I don't even have the words to express how grateful and extremely happy I am.   It's amazing to be able to face people with confidence.   Especially the line of work I am in.  I will always appreciate the work you have done for me.     Thank you for my second chance!!!!!   I will take great care of my implants.    I can't stop looking st them !   They look great !!</Text>

< Review>
From the time my husband and I entered the door, we were greeted with kindness, professionalism. Because I am such a coward when it comes to dentistal work which I truly need, from the dental assistant to my first exam with Dr. Brasai, I was catered to and reasured that I would receive the best of care and it truly eased my nervousness. Currently I am waiting to start a treatment plan which I am excited about and looking forward to starting and completing all my dental needs. I truly encouraged others who are having dental issues,  please consider coming to Dr Andrea Joy Smith dental office. A church member referred me and I'm so thankful she did!</Review>

Wonderful, as always - Dr Smith and Staff as good as they get! Great Dentist and a better human being.  She has worked with me to get a great smile after a  lifetime of not having one...she worked with me in every way, she listened to my hopes and my budget and created a plan that worked beautifully.  Thank you Dr. Smith - that is why I drive 4 hours just to keep her as my dentist.  The best!</text>

<review>Our entire family (immediate and extended) has been seeing Dr. Smith for years!  She and her staff are friendly, gentle, professional, and do everything possible to ensure a comfortable visit.  You know it's a great sign when your kids are asking to go visit her!  I totally recommend her to anyone looking for a new dentist.  They are the best!< /review>< Pics>

5 Star Rating!! One of the best dentist you’ll ever find. You can trust her. The  staff is very friendly.  I highly recommend Dr. Andrea Joy Smith for your dental work. On 8/28/2020 I went in had  some work done. People she is the BEST in Sacramento , CA.  She’s well worth it! She put a smile back on my face. I need a lot of work done and I keep on coming back.  My most recent  visit to Dr. Andrea Joy Smith on 10/1/2020. She is so good at what she does. I will continue to use her service in the future.<//text>

My wife and I started with Dr. Smith just a few months ago. From the first time we walked into her office we knew we made the right decision, all of her staff are wonderful. Her office is great and full of the latest technology, especially compared to our last dentist. Thanks Dr. Smith and team!!< /Text>

I live in the Bay Area and I travel to Sacramento to see Dr. Smith. I have been her patient for over 11 years and no matter where I live in California, I make the trip to see Dr. Smith. Family n friends all think I'm crazy and try to recommend other dentists but none of them live up to Dr. Smith.

I have a severe phobia of dentists, struggle with anxiety and have a panic attack disorder. Dr. Smith's sedation services make dentistry possible for me despite my limitations. Other sedation dentists want to use IV sedation but Dr. Smith only uses the most minimally evasive options in all her work, including sedation. I know I'm a difficult patient but Dr. Smith makes me feel like her favorite patient and I am so grateful to have a dentist like her.

I tell her all the time, "If it wasn't for you, I would have no teeth." She smiles n laughs but it's true! No matter what it is that's keeping you from the dentist...fear, embarrassment, anxiety, or any other medical condition...you don't need to live in pain. Dr. Smith can and will fix it because everyone deserves to smile</text>

I had my first visit with Dr. Smith today.  Dr. Smith is very knowledgeable about treatment options that I didn't know about before.  She began a treatment with me right away to help  with my chronic pain.  I was there for a consultation and she went above and beyond anything I have experienced before at other dentists.  I am so grateful.   She is very focused on what my individual needs are.  Her staff are also very professional and kind.<//Text>

This has been a great dental experience I really feel spoiled regardless of my insurance.  Dr. Smith and her staff really takes care of you.  I want to move but her dental care has become a reason not to...  How will I find another dentist who truly cares about your teeth and your smile.< /text>

I've had a rough time with my teeth, no insurance,years of pain med prescriptions (which are horrible for teeth) and not a lot of money. I've seen many dentists but none like Dr Smith. The first time she saw me was for a dental emergency..I was so worried about missing a tooth when I smile and she made sure that did NOT happen. So now I'm a patient here. I do not worry, despite paying because the staff is so friendly, the dentists so thorough, and the pressure non existent. They even referred me to an insurance carrier that's helping with the costs as I need a LOT of work. I needed a good dentist, who was going to listen and help. I found that here.<//text>

It is always a pleasant experience being there. My last visit was on Nov. 8th. 2016. I give Doctor Smith and her staff a 4.95 rating out of 5.0.

<Review>Dr. Smith is by far the best denist I have ever had. I have recommended many of my family and friends to her and all of them have are very satisfied with her work as we all know it takes more than good work to be a denist it also helps if you are a good person and she certainly is that and her staff are great too. Keep up the good work....Gary and Sunita Penny</Review>< pics>

Dr Smith is just so easy going she knows her stuff im kind of loosing hope because of the prize but hey there is a God no i dont want to go to a foreing city to get my work done my damage was caused by some medication the worse is being judge and even by a medical doctor ..who lost his license didnt even know  my name and the question he asked me.. it was sad..and its imbarrasing. But Gods will be done...but even if i dont get my birthday wish to come true ....i will still give Dr.Smith..5 Stars she kows her thing .< /review>

smooth as boston cream pie the staff is so kind  so professional and so efficient as for andrea such a lovely person  so refined so experienced she makes her job look easy. she made me feel so at ease through a very scary procedure. the passion and dedication she displays in the work she does  is second only to honesty and integrity she displays as a person. when i am sitting there in the dentists chair along with andrea and her staff it gives me that down home feeling , you know the kind you get when  youre coming home for the holidays and sitting down for some good home cooking with family and friends.if it sounds like i cant say enough great things about these people ...youre right  i cant!!!   tell your family tell your friends TELL THE WORLD all about this wonderful place ! i know i am.I'M TELLING YOU NOW!!!!</text>

He made sure that the rental car I got was to my satisfaction.  I am an Emerald Club member of National Rental Car so when I booked with Alamo I did not know what type of customer service I would get.  But lo and behold, a pleasant surprise!  The pickup and return was efficient and went by smoothly, hardly any waiting in line.  I highly recommend it!  Keep up the great customer service!<//text>< Pictures>

Rented an SUV from them for Thanksgiving week. - Wound up getting a beautiful Ford Excursion MAX Limited that worked AWESOME for our trip. - Tons of room for our 7 passengers and luggage from the airport, smooth ride, decent mileage. - Staff were friendly and efficient, paperwork was simple. - Only one small complaint... - The cars are jammed in TERRIBLY tight. - I could barely squeeze in the door! - I'm not that big of a guy either! - I'm sure if I would have asked for assistance it would have been granted, but I managed just fine.  Drop off of the vehicle was equally simple - pull in - friendly staff got to me quickly, noted the mileage and sent me on my way. - This was everything a rental should be! - Oh and the price was great! - Holiday week I expected to pay a lot more than we did for such a perfect family vehicle for the week.  THANKS!</Text>

We flew into Orange County from Texas to travel the Pacific Coast Highway . Alamo has an easy check in and out process. We loved our Jeep Cherokee! Unfortunately our car was broken into in San Francisco at the Warf. They busted our back window and back passenger window ( 3 other cars in our $40 parking, did I mention broad daylight,  were broken into.) Alamo and they're staff were great we switched out our car and kept going on our trip! Thanks Alamo!!! FYI thank God I purchased the extra insurance it totally was worth it!❤< /text>

The 1 star is really not for the overall staff but rather the manager, Matt (no last name). He decided to be judge and jury regarding an issue we had w/a temporary license. He has no clue as to what he’s doing. Believe it or not he was spewing information regarding a vehicle code, as if he’s an attorney, but I’m guessing he hasn’t  gone to school beyond high school. It’s against the law to give legal advise Matt (no last name - like Cher). He really has no idea how to deal with the public. When I sarcastically said “way to diffuse the situation.” His response was, “Thanks, I’ve been working on it.” That spoke volumes. He is passive / aggressive. He tried to wield his authority and to be intimidating, but was shaking at the same time. His hands were shaking when he gave me my paperwork.

Avoid the Alamo location at John Wayne airport, but instead, head on down to Budget / Avis. Way better customer service.< /text>

Fast service. Thank you to the staff and management for the free upgrade to a Dodge Challenger. Made my trip from SoCal to NorCal even better.< /Review>

From the initial greeting by Alamo team members to the extra effort to locate specific vehicle by the shift manager and super fast early morning airport drop off, the Alamo rental process was a breeze!
Awesome Tacoma truck did it’s job well and total price was far less than competitors & TURO options- BRAVA / BRAVO Alamo!<//text>

<text>Alamo is always the most cost competitive and easiest rental service out there.

Every time I have used them my experience is great.

The lines to get my car are always quick.

The car i receive is always clean and high value with all the desired bells and whistles to make my trip more enjoyable.

The pricing usually beats anyone else on the market.

Happy Customer.</text><Gmap_id>0x80dcdef72d684abd:0xe2c3d7e083d3af52</Gmap_id><user_id>113083572024627438835<//user_id></record>

< review>
This was the worst experience in renting a vehicle in my life. Two days into a 20 day rental, I had a flat tire. Called my AAA to come out, there are no jack or tools in truck to lower the spare so they can not do anything for me. Called Alamo Roadside assistance (Charged $50.00 extra) because I was forced to when no tools are available. I explain that there are no tools in the truck and they send out AAA who can't help because there is no way to lower the spare. I have to go through neighborhood to find someone with the proper tools. Come to find out that the tire that went flat had been plugged. Not patched but plugged. Way to endanger my safety and the safety of each person who rode in the truck.Two days later The "Change Oil" lights comes on, as the vehicle needs service. They gave a vehicle for 20 days that was going to need service soon. Had to drive on spare to get to airport to exchange vehicle. Once there they tell me that they can downgrade the vehicle without a problem, but can not give me the same vehicle in exchange. What kind of logic is this except that they are trying to give me a small vehicle for the price of the larger one I paid for. This was paid in advance so no refund could be given as it was a different franchise. Finally after 2 hours on the phone I finally received the same vehicle I had originally rented. Then a few days later even thought the vehicle was checked and cleared at the exchange site, I get an email saying that there is damage to the vehicle that I am responsible for. UNBELIEVABLE. I drove this car on Highways, only carried clothes and snacks to eat on trip. Now they want to charge me for something that I did not do to the truck. Finally make it back home to return the truck. Then I am told that I owe $12.00. When I ask for what I am told "I don't know" I explain that it was prepaid and there should be no added cost. I am told "Maybe you are late". I respond "No, I am actually returning the car a day early". Once again I am told "Well I do not know, but it says that you owe $12.00" I have never had issues with this company before but this rental definitely turned in the "Rental from Hell".<//review>

<username>isaac boll</username><Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Alamo left me, my wife, and one year old son stranded. We had a rental confirmed, and were told over the phone that someone would be there after hours to get us our car and car seat.

We chose this location because they were one of the only companies to offer after hour services, but when we got to the Alamo location by the airport there was no one there. When I called, they only told me that they could get us the car in the morning, which left all three of us stranded in the airport terminal all night with no other option.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dcdef72d684abd:0xe2c3d7e083d3af52<//GmapID>< Rating>

<text>I am truly disappointed in Alamo service and their policies. They have vehicles available to rent on a holiday weekend and they won't allow a California Resident the same options as an out of state visitor. If you have an itinerary with a flight they will except a debit card although if you a CA resident they will only except a credit card to be used. Where is the common sense in that? If I can afford to fly (have enough money or good credit) I would be able to have a credit card in my name to use to rent a vehicle. If I can't afford fly (I don't have enough money or not so good credit)I don't have a credit card available so i fit in their box. Im a struggling single parent trying to get somewhere and these restrictions make it impossible for the lower class Americans to do so. Our country is great and the offers we have are wonderful and im so thankful for for them but how is this helpful to a person like me who is trying to make it. I get it they need to cover themselves but this frustrating for anyone in my position to get anywhere.< /text>< pics>

We were very happy with our rental.  The car itself was great(clean and no issues).  SNA is a smaller airport, so you have less cars to pick from than larger rental locations.
We would rent from this location again.</text>

my experience is always great but when i rent these seven passengers i really need them to seat 7 and it makes it difficult in  caravans as they have bucket seats in the middle. The staff is always great as i have gotten to know many because of how often i rent from the location where i rent.< /review>

Doesnt take digital drivers license despite losing drivers license in another airport.  Doesnt bother to look up license number to validate credentials.   We are attending a funeral and has no empathy towards any other method of requiring authorization. Station manager is Christopher Aguilar.   Police officers can validate drivers license via DL# yet these guys need an actual physical drivers license?  Nowadays everything is digital. All they had to do is validate the drivers license yet. Someone that flies halfway from the midwest is denied car rental coverage despite already validating the car rental via website. Replace these guys with a machine instead! They are worthless for customer service support!! Dont use them< /review>

Do NOT, under ANY circumstances, give this company any of your business. My husband made a reservation for a car and carseat rental over the phone days ago. Our flight was scheduled to arrive at 10:10 pm and the representative from Alamo assured him that they would have someone stay two hours late to make sure that we could have our reservation at this time. My husband double, triple, and quadruple checked that this would happen, and over and over he was promised that someone would stay late to give us our rental.

Well WE. WERE. LIED. TO. Our flight came in as scheduled at 10:10, we walked to this location where our reservation was made and it is closed! No one is here. My husband called the company and was simply told that they close at 10, even though we have a reservation with a confirmation number saying otherwise.

The representative said that we could pick up a car tomorrow, but that is not an option, seeing as how we are now stranded at the airport parking garage at 11 pm with our 1 year old child. Apparently they expect us to sleep in the parking lot with our baby while we wait for them to fulfill their broken promises.

This awful depraved company has single handedly put my family in a terribly unsafe position. If a business following through on their word means anything to you whatsoever, I implore you to stay far far away from Alamo Rent A Car.

UPDATE:
I see that the owner has asked for us to email Alamo so that they could “look into this further.” My husband actually already emailed them last night (we had plenty of time while we were stuck at the airport alone until 2 am while we waited for my aunt with nightblindness to get out of bed, unload her car, fill it with gas, and brave the night to come rescue us) and we received a lackluster canned response trying to place the blame on us for being late to pick up the reservation. Yes you heard me right, even though we gave the employee our flight information when we made the reservation (which had our arrival time after 10 pm) and we were assured that someone would stay after, because their employee did not record this it is now somehow our fault that this company stranded our family at the airport parking garage in the middle of the night with no option to take an Uber (because we were renting a car seat) and no option to go with another rental company because they were all closed. Thank you for your inspired customer service, Alamo.</text>

Please beware if you are not white!This Location at John Wayne Airport has a systematic racial discrimination in place.I have been renting at Alamo for years and several other rental car agencies depending which has best offer.I booked online as usual normally use LAX rental terminals alot closer.But I had a reservation at Long Beach Airport when I arrived they where out of cars and sent reservation to John Wayne I was skeptical anyways when arrived the 1st attendant to one look at me my I'd and credit card without even looking up my reservation he runs out goes somewhere and comes back with Joshua Cabula I believe the manager he blantaly is looking for any reason to not honor the reservation he starts typing then says my I'd has a small tear on corner and he was not going to honor the rental agreement and said he would not rent me the and there was nothing he can do I have rented from Alamo within the last month and several other rental car agency while on Vacation.You could clearly see the look on his face and by how ridiculous his policy sounded made no sense I had my medical,Auto Insurance card several credit card 2 bank cards and my state worker I'd with a valid CA driver License and that still was not enough for a 46.00 rental for a return customer.As An African American this is the type of systematic discrimination we are up against in some cities.I hope things change by educating and addressing the issue.Mr Joshua Cabula need some type of racial discrimination class an Needs to be retrained on diversity issue an professionalism at work.</Review>

The agent was very friendly and didn't try to get me to buy a lot of additional things like GPS or other things just basic liability insurance which i got for 10 dollars a day. When i went to pick up the car i asked if it had a CD player it didn't so he looked at a few other cars until he found one with a CD player. I have rented cars a few times before and this was the best experience i ever had. I will truly consider Alamo in the future.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<text>Not a good experience from start to finish. Poor on-site service skills at all levels. Was my first time with Alamo and will be the last and canceled. These companies know how to *take* the reservation,  just don't know how to *hold* the reservation... and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them. If I'm making a reservation and checking in ahead and its not available I'm checking out of the company...I don't ask, I just move on and don't look back...from the cockpit to the car the door is closed.<//text>< date>

I have rented from Alamo in Orange County (SNA) a number of times. My last experience there will be my last ever, as due to an unprofessional lot attendant, I am now liable for hundreds of dollars of damage that was already present at pickup. The attendant, who was not in uniform and did not identify himself, handed me the keys and said "the car should be down there somewhere", pointing down an aisle. He then left and was nowhere to be seen. We noticed  small scuff on the side and some damage on the bumper, but it appeared to have been painted over already, so we thought nothing of it.

Fast-forward to 6 weeks later and I get bill in the mail for $700+. The claims dept. is giving me no way to dispute this other than "file with your insurance". Needless to say, Alamo is off my list.</Review>

I made our car rental reservation through Southwest, after my boyfriend and I decided to fly down to Orange County for my cousin's wedding in Temecula. Our plane landed at John Wayne and it was a short walk to the rental car area, then almost as short of a wait to get our car.

"Would you like a free upgraded vehicle?" we were asked. Um, yes, please?! No catch. We got the same size vehicle but nicer quality; ended up with a Nissan Pathfinder instead of a Jeep something.
For.
Free.

Enjoyed our unlimited miles for $27ish/day. (About $36 total per day once all taxes are included). No charge for adding a driver, which was great since I barely drove, even though each of our destinations was for my friends and family.

We returned the car a couple of days later and were happy the return process was as quick as check-in was. Thanks to Global Entry status and Alamo's customer service, we made it into the airport with time enough to spare for a final drink in SoCal before flying home.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Alamo rent a car goes above and beyond when it comes to customer satisfaction. After some negative experiences with other car rental places I don't go anywhere else than Alamo. They've earned my business for life for consistently providing high quality service and exceeding my expectations. Thank you for putting the customer first and ensuring I always leave happy!< /review>

When I went to pick the car up, there was a line and 1 person working so I had to wait longer than I wanted to.  When I saw the car I was getting, I was very excited.  It was a big and roomy new SUV.  I loved the car, and now would like to purchase that car.  Returning was very easy, especially trying to get to the gate with 2 kids.  It was basically a drop off, here are the cars, unload my stuff and walk away.<//text>

<text>Alamo Ford Equinox Complete Tire Separation while on So. Calif Fwy.
While on the 73 Fwy. in Orange County on 9/30/18 on my way to John Wayne Airport, the tire light came on and not soon after the car felt "strange."  I moved over into the far right lane, sensing something was wrong with the tires.  As I was doing this, I lost most of my steering control.  Thankfully, there were few cars on the hwy. and I was able to make it all the way over onto the right shoulder of the fwy.  As I went around the car to see what was wrong, I saw that the front right passenger tire, had only the "walls" of the tire and the complete part of the tire that meets the road was gone.  Wow, this is a first for me.  Evidently, there was some defect in the tire.  Unfortunately, I got a call today to say that Alamo put in a claim regarding this incident, as if I were at fault.  I would have thought Alamo would have called to find out if I was okay and what they could do for me, after this incident. Nope.
I trust this is a never had or rare incident for any vehicle rental agency.
My concern, after this experience and question would be how carefully are the vehicles being returned, inspected before being sent out again on another rental?< /text>< Pics>

Great customer service from checking in to get the car at the Airport (John Wayne - Santa Ana). They made sure that I knew all the features of the car before leaving. When returning the car, the Rep made sure I got all my stuff out. They made check out process very simple and easy. I highly recommend renting from Alamo at John Wayne Airport.</text>

There is an exceptional long wait at the counter and it's understaffed. Allow an additional 45 minutes and non-peak times to process at the counter. The counter staff is very friendly and they do have managers working the front lines were you pick up the car but I think they need to have some of the managers overseeing the counter at the airport. I was disappointed in my sport car rental experience the colors were a drab and mundane. Rental return clerks in my opinion are among some of the worst I personally have encountered< /Review>

I try to use Alamo as much as I can, the cars are great, the price is competitive and the service is good. I had checked in on line for a car at the Orange County airport and tried to use the Kiosk to get my reservation. The Kiosk does not work for California Drivers licenses. I had to stand in line, with only one service provider and about 6 people in line. Certainly not the end of the world, but why would the Kiosk not work on California drivers when we are in California? That is just plain wrong. Why would you have the option to check in online, if it doesn't do me any good??<//review>

So first let me start by saying I am normally NOT a fan of rental car places. So man, was I in for quite the surprise here. Let me begin by saying it is extremely accessible. Next it was quick! Most importantly, the staff was so so soooo FRIENDLY and HELPFUL. They even hooked me up with a sweet deal and gave me recommendations on how to do it for the future. There was no BS. I was pleasantly surprised by my whole experience and can not recommend this place enough. I wish I remembered the name of the man who helped me so I could give him a shout out!
I will add that I only picked up here. So I cannot attest to the drop off process though people looked happy.< /review>

I love to rent from Alamo, but I hope to never have to rent from this location again. I am so used to being able to pick the vehicle I drive and when I asked if they had anything else they said it was all they had. Fortunately Alamo allows you to do a swap. So I drove to LAX which is closer to home and was able to get something I could choose. Ended up with at Ford Fusion hybrid. This car is great.< /Text>

Alamo has been one of the more frequent rental service for me from past few years. They always provide very good car for decent price. It has been very nice experience whenever I have rented with Alamo.< /Text>

Received notification less than 16 hours before pickup time that the rental car that was reserved in advance was not going to be available. Very poor customer service. They were not willing to assist in rectifying the situation. Would not recommend reserving a car with them as it clearly doesn't mean anything and is likely to leave you stranded. Should have trusted the other poor reviews on here instead of the good ones. Renters beware</text>

Great service with renting a vehicle at Alamo.  Reservation confirmation was quick and easy and the person at vehicle pickup was patient enough to allow me to try a couple of vehicles to be sure I could see out of them adequately.  Once again, we appreciated the professionalism offered by Alamo!< /review>

I rented a 15 passenger van from Alamo's SNA airport, the van wasn't cleaned and sanitized. Upon returning the vehicle to SNA, I was not able to return the van in a timely manner, it took me over an hour to return the van back to Alamo.< /Review>

Omar at SNA Alamo was excellent! Received the best customer servicer ever!! Check in was painless!! Upgraded to a Mustang, but wished the inside would have been a little more cleaner. That would be my only complaint.  Other than that, I will be a returning customer. Thanks Omar!!!< /review>

<Review>Competitive pricing but not worth it to experience poor, insulting customer service.

The girl at the counter was unpleasant when I asked for an upgrade, I had entered a code for it in my reservation when I booked.

The code did not show, and from then on the rep at the counter was dismissive of all questions I asked and yelled to her coworker the car type I am to pick up, and I quote  her "just so that you are aware", to her coworker.  Why do people feel this free to behave this way?

Of my years of renting with different companies whether it was Hertz or Enterprise, for a day or a few years, I never encountered such ignorant interpretations of simple inquiries and responses from a car rental rep.

I did not catch her name. My car rental time is stamped at 7:33pm, 02/12/2019.

I should have, went with the other rentals when I was trying to locate a rep at the counter. They had such professional service, and redirected me where Alamo reps were.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1550177168984, 'text': 'Private Customer, we would like to look into this further but need some more information.

<Review>I rented from Alamo in Orange County because they did not have any large vans available in Los Angeles. So I caught a train down there to pick it up and although they do keep the vans in a separate lot from the airport it was not ready for pick up  nor was it clean. after it was taken for a wash and brought to me I got in and drove off because i had somewhere  to be in L.A. when i got to my destination i took a look in the back and it was filthy the seats were stained the cup holders have spills coming down the walls. it was really bad i had to clean it myself and it still was not good enough. long story short this was my first experience with Alamo at John Wayne Airport and it was extremely disappointing.

P.S. I tried to post pic's but it didn't work<//Review>< gmapID>

<review>Alamo has been always the first and the best rental car for me. I rent cars from different categories, sporty, luxury SUV, Full-size, etc at least twice a month. I got a sporty car (Dodge Challenger) last month for only $25/day. Sometimes they offer very good upgrades/deals to larger/better cars. Last week I rented a Full-size SUV, and you know what I got, a Chevy Suburban LT with only 150 miles on it. Do not bother yourself with other cheap rental cars for $10-20 less because if you do so you will get a much cheaper/nasty car.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>They've gone from 5 stars to less than 1 star since my review 8 months ago.  Never renting from Alamo anywhere again.  Twice with one-way rentals to PHX from SNA I was given a vehicle with pre-existing difficult to see damage and twice under their microscopic examination at the drop-off they've tried to charge me for it.  Hint.  They give you the worst cars when it is a one-way rental.  One of the recent vehicles with damage was also filthy.  They claim they inspect and disinfect every one.  Obviously not the case.  I don't have the time and energy to fight with them and waste time documenting every little defect that I might find in the dark rental center.  So I'm back to Avis / Budget which I absolutely hate but they don't have microscopic examinations.  Sometimes the worst is actually better!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< GmapID>

I recently rented a small SUV from Alamo at John Wayne International Airport. The check-in process went smoothly and quickly and I received the car I reserved, which is not always the case with the other rental companies I've used. The car was clean and ran well. When I returned the car, the check-in was also quick and pleasant. I will definitely rent from Alamo again the next time I travel. This was pretty much the experience I want when renting a vehicle.<//review>

Rented full size car for 1 day trip up to Fresno. Car was great. I had called Alamo Customer Service line before I reached the airport to ask about their credit card policy and if there was a deposit when checking out the car. I was told that if I had not pre-paid for the reservation then they will be authorizing my credit card for the amount of the reservation. No additional deposit required. However, at the front counter the girl who checked me in didn't mention any deposit, just asked for my ID and credit card and off we were to get our car in less than 5 minutes. I only noticed the $200 additional deposit when I logged onto to my credit card company and saw the authorization. Then upon returning the vehicle we were running about 20 minutes behind. I had return time of 12 noon. It was 20 minutes to noon when I was filling up the car and I called Alamo and spoke to another customer support person who advised me that I had a 30 min grace period so I should be fine. I arrive at 12:17p and was given a receipt which had a 2 hour charge. I asked the guy who checked me out what it was for and he explained that I actually picked up the car at 11:30a and so it was due in by 11:30a. I asked about the 30 min grace period and he didn't know what to say. He was kind enough to fix it but had I not looked at my receipt I wouldn't have noticed the extra charge. Not happy with this transaction. Probably won't rent from them again.< /Text>

When I return the cars, all the people are really quick to get you checked back in.  Very pleasant experience while your traveling in and out of the airport.

I have started to use Alamo over Enterprise. I'm glad I made the switch. I loved Enterprise but Alamo has really been better. The ease at the counter in the airport was great. The friendly staff was great. They offered me an upgrade at an extremely low price. It was still lower than the advertised price for that upgrade and I loved it. Got exactly what I wanted and it was easy to pick up and easy to drop off. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thanks Alamo!< /Review>

Nissan Rogue -- Black.  Well-crafted interior.  Spacious.  Ample seat for any adult driver/passenger.  Very good fuel economy and power-performance.  The seat warmer switch is awkwardly placed; my hand accidentally turned it on when I was opening the center storage console because of its low location.  It would be better placed on the dashboard.

The fob needs to have a chain or tie that the renter can attach to something.  Since I use an actual key on my own vehicle, I am not accustomed to the fob, and kept forgetting in which compartment of my purse I put it in; plus, it always made me nervous that I might have misplaced it because it is an unattached, small object.

Customer service at John Wayne airport is as-expected.  Staff try to be nice, but are generally unpolished in pulling this off.  They come across as fawning, patronizing.  Speed of service during the off-peak hours that I checked out and checked in the vehicle was fast, as it should be.< /Text>

<Review>Worst customer service I've ever had. The manager Godfrey had attitude & was hostile from the moment we stepped up to the window. The minute my Uncle asked him for a refund because of the service & the attitude, Godfrey raised his voice & told us we better leave before he called the police on us. I've never been treated so poorly, especially by a business who was paid for their services, in my entire life. Will never give them my business again. I'm sure my family will do the same after being yelled at for asking for a refund. Save your money, go elsewhere. Wish I could give 0 star's.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I contracted with a deal for whatever car was most available. When I arrived at Alamo, I was greeted courteously and the paperwork was fast and easy. My grandchildren were thrilled that I ended up with a 6 passenger car and I could take their friends along with us for day trips.  It was clean and ready to go. Returning the car took less than 5 minutes. I would do this again. Great experience< /review>

Finely of Alamo here in Santa Ana has a very thin skin and absolutely abuse of power. There is nothing professional about him at all. He threatened and me to deny car service without an obvious good reason for questioning why the information on the car rental was different from Alamo. They don’t need to be questioned at all. They are like car mafia bosses such a< /Text>

<Text>It was a good experience checking in and out. I would recommend them in the future. My only issue is when I checked in on the self check-in computer it offered me an upgraded for a certain price for a premium vehicle which I accepted. When I went to the counter they didn't have the vehicle and I was offered another premium vehicle but it was at a higher price and the rep said that the self check-in offers are better and there was nothing she could do. It doesn't make much sense especially since I accepted not to allow the rep to match the price I was offered.  Again besides that it was a good experience.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Would love to get a higher rank. But was pretty perturbed when arriving they did not offer me an American made car. I called the previous day to make sure that I would have one available they assured me it would not be a problem. I stood around for 30 minutes waiting for a different vehicle.

There were no more cars available at the level made with my reservations so I was given a complimentary upgrade. Darnett was amazing!. Very nice young man who was pleasant to all of the customers in line. He should be promoted as he was very expedient in getting everyone to their cars with a smile.

<Review>Counter and garage staff were extremely helpful and enthusiastic. We left our house key by mistake on the rental car's key fob when we returned it. When we realized our error an hour later, that car had already been rented to another customer. But a very alert Alamo employee had noticed our key, set it aside, and we were able to retrieve it, saving our day! Exemplary attention to detail and service. Alamo remains our go-to rental company.< /Review>< Pictures>

The minivan I rented for my family was great.  It was brand new; had 200 miles on the odometer.

Checkout from the counter was not that smooth.  I was quoted $200 more at the counter and fortunately I was able to pull up my reservation email and show the agent the price from the reservation.  It took 10 minutes for the two agents to figure out how to match their computer to my reservation price.  It worked out, but not very smoothly.< /review>

The associate in the garage barely spoke to us. He pointed to a row of cars in the dark garage and said take that white one on the end. He handed me the keys and walked away. The car was scraped up on the front bumper as well as the rear bumper. He made no notation of that of course since he did not even look at the car.  The exterior of the car was pretty dirty and  It also did not have a single drop of windshield washer fluid in it.<//review>

<Review>The low rating is not due to my original rental from the Santa Ana (John Wayne) Airport. They were spot on; courteous  and professional.
My poor rating is reflection of my experience with roadside assistance call line and the Long Beach Airport staff (except Nikki) and their District Manager.
The people at this location are callous about their customers and their care; having returned a VW Atlas that consistently shut off in the power -down mode, they put the car back on the line even though I told them it was mechanically unsafe.
I had to get a manager and insist that she remove the car from rental use, Raven was irresponsible in caring for her customers as was the District Manger as he explained away the issue. His quote was that they could not duplicate the problem and it had been back in rental use for 2-days without issue. Car problems do not magically resolve themselves.
I received good service from customer care prior to going to Long Beach ; they refunded me the 2-days of fees in which the car was stopping and set up a replacement.</Review>< Pics>

The only reason for not giving Alamo 5 stars is when I picked up the car, it was still wet from being washed which I don't mind.  But there were water spots all on the side mirrors which made it difficult to see.  I suggest that they simply wipe/dry the windows and side mirrors.  Everything else was great.<//Review>< Time>

I've always had a good experience renting from Alamo and particularly at the John Wayne Airport location.  The reservation process, and check-in and check-out are always smooth and the vehicles I've been provided are always in good condition and usually a higher end trim level of the selected vehicle.  I'll keep using Alamo because they're less expensive and give me everything I want.<//review>

<text>The manager served Alamo well....they should be proud of him and his desire to make the customer happy.  The vehicle that arrived did not match what I booked, but there was no argument; he immediately went into problem solving mode and gave me a vehicle that would make my group of 6 even more comfortable than the one we booked.  The entire transaction from booking to returning was simple and smooth.</text><Date>1500212667997< /Date>< Response>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>I will never rent again from Alamo/National/Enterprise.  This was the worst experience I have EVER had!  The key fob was damaged and no one would call me back.  I spent almost 3 days (half the vacation) tracking down how to get a new key fob and at the end, my AAA representative (who helped as I had to arrange a tow) mentioned roadside assistance.  It would have been nice had Alamo actually called back and mentioned this!  Then at the end, the dealer I found also couldn’t get Alamo to return the call to release the car!  Seriously!?!  Then, the car with the new key fob wouldn’t work so another car wasnbrought over...one that apparently had a flat as it had a donut for a tire and half a tank of gas.  When I dropped off the car at the airport the attendant was super rude and hassled me about the donut tire (which I had nothing to do with) and when I returned the car with he same half tank I received it.  Done!  Ridiculous and completely unprofessional every step of the way.  Will never make this mistaken again and after such an experience will encourage everyone I know to not rent from this group as it is not worth the awfulness.  Save yourself the headache and stress and go with ANYONE else!<//Review>< Pics>

First let me say I've rented here 30 times so far this year.
The people are generally polite, biggest issue so far is that many times the cars aren't cleaned well. Worst issue was an OPEN bottle of alcohol left in the car..

However this time after turning my car in on a Sunday night, I go to switch the charge to my debit card, as I usually do.
The charge is approx 50 bucks.
I go to the counter, hand the guy my debit and he says all set.

Next morning, I look at my account and apparently "All SET" means charging my card twice for $210.00 and $310.00. Posted charges, not holds.

Monday, call Alamo. Get told the location has to fix it and they will call me. Nobody calls.

Tuesday First thing, call again. Get the run around and told it's probably my fault. Riiiight. Literally every way to blame me. Finally they will call the location again. 6 hours later I get a call, I miss the call but call back shortly.

Again hear about a half dozen ways it's probably my fault. Finally after about 40 minutes the guy seems to understand what's going on. But cant help. Someone else has to and will call me back.

Wednesday nothing.

Thursday. Call again. Again get the run around and that its probably my fault. Worst problem with the 800 number customer service, they seem automatically be trained to not listen and blame you.

You must have had more than 1 rental. NOPE
You must have damaged it. NOPE
You must have not put gas in. NOPE
It's only a hold. NOPE (after telling them it was a switch to a different card)

Finally I get transferred to "escalations"
Where again, I get told it's my fault.

After beating my head against a brick wall... Im told "you could always just dispute it instead of keep calling".

Really? Basically telling the customer to "eff off and fix it yourself" Thats ridiculous customer service. Thanks for telling me I can go drive to my bank and waste even more of my time fixing YOUR MISTAKE myself.

So now a District Manager is supposed to call and that was 6 hours ago.. Not holding my breath at this point.
Edit...8pm 11 hours after I was supposed to get a call, no call. Good thing I didn't hold my breath. I'd be dead, and still out 500 bucks.

EDIT 2...  Noon in Friday.
Still no call from the District Manager or the Location manager.
Called Customer (no) Service again. And again it's my fault.

4...now 5 days 6
...now 7 people and no results. Probably the most inept customer service across the board,  I've ever come across.

Hopefully if you rent here you don't have any issues, because if you do, you are in for a clown show.
I've been a district manager myself for several retailers and had to deal with similar issues countless times. Never has it taken me 4 days (and counting) to address a customer and get the issue resolved.</Text>

They ran out of the four-door sedan size vehicle I requested (Toyota Camry), but they allocated me a sports car, a Dodge Challenger. I had a great experience from beginning to end. I dropped it off before my flight after topping off a full tank of gas. It took 30 seconds for them to read my gas tank indicator and gave me a receipt. Absolutely painless. I'd recommend them again as always.</Text>< UserId.>

I have been renting Alamo every time I need traveling. Alamo at John Wayne Airport in CA has professional  staffs. They are always helping out to customers. I rented only at other rental cars because Alamo was not available; especially summer. Wish Alamo would offer special deal to frequent customers.  Alamo is my favorite rental car; they have new cars and better millage.<//review>

Be aware of tolls in california, alamo conveniently fails to mention that you need to register on "paymytolls" before renting car, otherwise you are forced to pay their $20 administation fee for toll payment...if preregistered there are no fees...deceptive practice...clearly nickel & diming their customers<//Review>

The vehicle I rented had a stale smell inside of it when I first got in it. I thought if I drove away with the windows slightly ajar, the smell would slowly go away. Also, the sun was down when I got the car early in the morning. Once the sun rose, I could see that all of windows were extremely dirty on the inside. It was like someone with sticky hands went around to each window and smeared their hands on them. I had to clean all windows and deodorize the vehicle in order to enjoy it. Whomever was responsible to clean that vehicle ONLY sprayed down the outside! When I called customer service to inform them of how I received the vehicle, they made note of it on my reservation. I ended up paying less for my rental than expected, but a customer shouldn't have to worry about if the car will be clean and free of smells when renting a car. The customer service I received on the phone when filing my concern and when returning the vehicle were AMAZING.<//text>

I rented a Ford Edge Titanium through Costco Alamo and was very pleased with the comfortable ride. MPG could have been better, but I had a lot of luggage. I do have one gripe - Alamo should explain that with electronic tolling you cannot pay the toll authority directly. Alamo's third-party company will bill you and add a large fee for the service. This is not EZ=Pass territory (Calif). I would like to compliment the manager at John Wayne Airport location who compensated me for the alignment problem.</Review>

I switched a week long rental from Hertz as a gold member to Alamo because they were 1/3rd the price. The nice lady at the counter was fast, efficient and very pleasant. When I went to pick up the car, the young lady that helped me was so nice and accommodating.

Overall, a wonderful experience, thank you Alamo! Will use you in the future.< /Text>

<text>All Foreigners: On this location, they do not except an international ID as a document (also no German IDs). You have to bring your passport with you, even you have been a customer before and they have every information they need. Otherwise they won't let you rent a car.
Normally an internalional ID, which is a legal document in the U.S., is fine. Other Alamo locations and rental companies mostly do except regular IDs.

Staff was friendly, cars clean, location fine.<//text>< pics>

Did everything online. Fast in and out. Drove one way from Orange County to Denver--no extra costs for the one way (did rent for one week though). Added bonus, I was given a brand new car. Though they are not the cheapest local, they were by far the cheapest one way. The drop off was even quicker. No standing in line for anything. I was impressed by the whole experience. Alamo has a convert!<//Text>

<Review>I've rented from Alamo before with good service and prices. This last time though, I had to wait an extraordinarily long time to get my car after all the paperwork was completed. There was only one person on the job. He did not know what was available. The car was not washed very well. I loved the Nisson that I drove and everything else went fine, but it was a long late first night for my wife and me.<//Review>< Pics>

My latest rental with Alamo at John Wayne (Orange County) Airport was completely hassle free. I loved the fact that I can now "check in" online so when I get to the counter all they have to do is verify my driver's license and I'm on my way.  Lines were short at pick up and returning the car was as slick as valet parking.<//text>

<review>The Alamo experience was good at John Wayne Airport but there were a couple issues. The car rental location in the parking garage is excellent for both pick up and return- very convenient and easy. The car I rented- a Chevy Malibu drove well but got very poor mileage for the size of car- about 20 mph-about the same size as an Altima which would get 28-30. That meant the gas cost more.  I asked for a GPS and $10 extra per day and turned out that meant an external Garmin not a built in one. It did not work well. The signal came and went making it unreliable. I wouldn't do that again.  My cell phone worked better.< /review><GmapID>0x80dcdef72d684abd:0xe2c3d7e083d3af52< /GmapID><time>1533647175547</time>< resp>

After being reminded that as non-Fast Track members we needed to go to the counter in the terminal(even though we already had a reservation), staff helped us anyway and gave us a nice upgrade for a nominal additional amount. I take points off though because the vehicle was dirty and smelled of cigarette smoke. Note there is an airport tax that may not be reflected in the stated price.< /review>

Like the fact that the kiosk is on the airport grounds rather than to have to take a shuttle.  Staff friendly and courteous and went out of their way to provide me the best vehicle available for my needs.  My only complaint was that this particular vehicle was supposed to be "non-smoking" , and it was obvious that a previous renter had smoked.<//review>

The car itself was great I'm only giving 3 stars for customer service.  We were upgraded to an SUV when we arrived because they ran out of the car we selected (this was a plus).  However, the guy pointed to the car and handed me the keys.  No explanation about the car so if you weren't familiar you needed to just figure it out.  I had to ask him two questions and he seemed very inconvenienced by this.  I don't rent cars very often but I feel they should ask you if you have any questions about the car if the customer has them.</text>

<text>Easy return for vehicle. Lots of space inside the seating area, but my wife likened the car to a huge house with lots of living space and tiny bedrooms. We are disappointed with Alamo for false advertising because we rented an SUV for 7 passengers and it said it fits 5 bags (1 large, 2 medium and 2 small). NOT EVEN CLOSE! We were able to fit one large and one medium in the back and THAT'S IT! We had to smash the second medium bag between two kids in the back and store the other two in the middle sections with our kids having to put their feet on them. We rented based upon our luggage capacity and if we knew it was going to be so cramped, we would have purchased something with larger luggage capacity.</text>< pics>

With that being said. The last 2 rentals I've had have been very dirty on both the interior and exterior.  The first time it smelt like someone had just eaten fast food. The car smelled like french fries and had soda stains on the console. This last time I was was pressed for time and had to get on the road. But the car reeked of cigarettes.  There are stickers on the dash prohibiting smoking but they were clearly ignored.I had to spray Febreze to make it barable.   In addition, the exterior was filthy.   I do like the company, but if this happens again I will be forced to go elsewhere and pay the extra few dollars to have a clean ride for my family.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1512683731580, 'text': "We're listening and would like to know more, Mr. Flood.

I had a nice experience with my most recent car rental with Alamo. The price was outstanding, surpassing my expectations. The service was friendly and prompt. The car was a nice, well maintained Chevy Impala. I will be looking to Alamo for my future car rental needs.</Review>

<Review>The staff at Alamo at Orange County Airport were excellent. Within 10 minutes, I was in my mini SUV and on my way to a work meeting. I appreciate Alamo's staff realizing that a lot of business travelers fly through John Wayne Airport, and that time is of the essence. I will always use Alamo Car Rental when travelling to Southern California.< /Review>< resp>

That’s a huge plus considering I do so much traveling I am always looking for a good rental deal. 8 out of 10 times when I rent a car it’s never really clean and has a musty smell to it. Even when I returned the rental the gentleman that assisted me was fantastic!  In other words a great team working at the John Wayne airport Alamo rental.
I was meeting my sister there and her flight was arriving after mine. We were there to meet my son whom I haven’t seen in a year!! Unfortunately, when I called and explained the situation no one was able to accomodate the situation. I had spoke to several people and asked if possible my sister could be added as a driver so she could pick up the car since I wouldn’t be arriving for another 6 hours. Nothing could be done.  Only option was to cancel the reservation and have her start a new one (which the rate I had there was no way I was canceling). Unless she had a physical card of mine there was no way around it. Again, unforeseen circumstances that should be addressed in the next staff meeting.  We can fly a man to the moon and back, yet couldn’t accommodate a situation I had no control over. Situations like this happen and I feel there is a better approach to resolving issues such as this.

Experience at the counter at the airport was fine, howeve, with only one person at the counter, it may have taken us a long time to get our vehicle.   When my husband made the reservation, he asked for a compact car of which we did not get. We got a jeep, which was the only one left for us to get.  The person who gave us the keys was not exactly friendly either.  We did not feel comfortable driving the jeep around as well.  We may decide to give Alamo another chance, but not too soon.<//Text>

<review>Alamo did a great job getting renters through the line to check-in.  The attendant provided an upscale Chrysler 300 for $11 per day which was much appreciated when another traveler was added to our itinerary.
Checkout also went very smoothly and it is very accessible to the airport since the rental cars are in the adjoining garage.H</review><Response>None</Response><pics>None<//pics><user>107551613810824447638< /user>< rating>

<Name>Darcy Becker<//Name><Review>The wait to get our car last Thursday evening was RIDICULOUS! I've never had to wait so long.  There were 2 people working the desk.  After about 30 minutes of waiting a 3rd worker finally showed up but then took the last people to walk in - not those of us that had been waiting forever!  There should be ONE line so that the next customer gets the next available customer service rep.  I had reserved a "Standard SUV" and ended up with a Nissan Rogue which I believe should be considered a "Intermediate SUV".  Not happy this time and I usually love renting from Alamo.< /Review><date>1479834198957<//date>< resp>

<text>Rented a car from John Wayne Airport. Very good experience; everyone that I dealt with was fine. Was given a 2015 Chevy Impala with 2000 miles on it. It was a great car. On the second day, I was caught in a flash flood and the Impala was non-driveable. Alamo was quick to get a replacement car to me. It was over 2 hours away from the closest Alamo so they flat-bedded a Camry to me and picked up the Impala. The Camry was pretty ragged out. It only had 12000 miles, but it smelled, was dirty and not as comfortable as the Impala. I would use Alamo again.</text>< Pictures>

I am only giving the one start because the gentleman that helped us when we dropped off the car was very kind and helpful.

The car we got was incredibly disgusting.  It smelled like cigarette smoke before even entering the car but we only had it for one night and after a long plane ride I was just ready to get to our destination so I did not complain.  I just drove with the windows down.  Once at our first spot we noticed a splatter of I am not sure what all over the passenger side interior of the car.  I nearly threw up because at first it looked like blood.  Still not sure what it was but it was gross.  The car not only reeked of cigarette smoke but also body odor.  Once we got to our destination I dropped the car off early because it was so disgusting I did not want it a second longer that I had to have it.  I only had the car for a few hours.  The car had obviously not been cleaned at all.  Very dissatisfied by our experience and I don't know if I will rent with Alamo again in fear of getting a disgusting car.  We have rented with many other companies before and I will most likely rent with someone else because we have never had such a poor experience.<//Text>

<text>Even though a weekday, Alama counter and kiosks closed in airport.  Had to wait in line for 15 minutes at car center for an agent as kiosks were not present.  Had to wait for another 15 minutes for someone in the car lot to give me keys and walk me to my vehicle.  Far above an acceptable amount of time to wait for a vehicle when an Insider.< /text>< Gmap_id>

The manager at John Wayne Airport is awful. I would suggest renting from National who has always been about customer service and ensuring that all their customers’ needs are met.< /Text>

Picking up and returning the car was very easy. Vehicle was fairly new and ran very well. I just wish they had cleaned the interior better. Mats were dirty, dash was dusty, trash in the cup holders.<//Review>

<review>I've used Alamo for many years but the rental experience at John Wayne Airport was the best ever. My original flight from Denver was canceled at the last minute and I was rebooked to the following day. I called Alamo to change the reservation to my new arrival day/time. Upon arrival the rep asked about my change, then upgraded me to a better car.  The Audi was awesome and made my trip very pleasurable. Thanx Alamo!!< /review>< pics>

Warning that the online check-in does nothing at this location.  You still need to wait in line in the airport for the counter person and provide your driver's license and credit card again at that time.</Text>< pictures>

< review>
When are flight arrived at John Wayne Airport we proceeded to the baggage claim to get our bags.  The Alamo rent a car office was a short walk outside to the rental car parking lot.  There were 2 people ahead of us and just waited about 5 minutes to get our vehicle.  Check in was very easy (since I did the reservation online before we left for our vacation) she just had to re-verify all of the information and then we signed a few documents.  She asked me if I wanted to upgrade (I believe because they did not have the car available that we reserved online), I declined the upgrade (which I would have been charged for) and when we got outside to get our keys they ended up upgrading us, so instead of getting the Toyota Corolla that we reserved online we ended up with a Dodge Charger (which was very nice!).  The car had only 8123 miles and we did not have any issues through our rental.  We returned the rental car to the Airport in Las Vegas (which was set up when I reserved the rental car online).  Drop off was very easy, just drove up to the drop off point, unloaded our vehicle and they came over checked over the car and gave me a receipt.  I noticed that I was charged an extra $22.78 for a tourism fee....I am not sure why....but I am going to get with AMX to see if they will adjust the fee for me.  Overall we were very happy with the rental and would rent from Alamo again.<//review>

The car we rented hadn't been cleaned very well. There were empty plastic bottles in the back seat and crumbs on the seat. Also, half way thru our rental period, the check engine light came on so they had to bring us another car. Alamo was efficient in bringing us a new car and they also gave us an upgraded car. Unfortunately, I left my sunglasses (Maui Jims) in the old car and when I called the next day to ask if they had the glasses, they only let you leave a message. You can't talk to a real person. The lost and found message says that if you don't hear from them, that means they haven't found your item. They don't even get back to you. I knew exactly where the glasses were but I could never get a real person to talk to me.</review>

The car was not clean. It looked clean outside but was dirty inside.
The seats were not clean up properly.
The windshield water was almost empty. After couple uses, the windshield light on the dashboard was on.
It took more than 10 minutes to return car at SNA. It's under staff, less staff for more customers.
Alamo was my favorite and always my first choice but in the past few rents, I see the service quality  kept going down.</text>

<user_name>Karen Cheung</user_name><Text>Rate was confusing online when I signed up for Alamo insider. It made you think you were getting an upgrade from the line you were on and when I arrived the lady at the desk said that the pricing line was with the upgrade. She then told me they were out of full size cars but when I went to get the car they had a full size car. It didn't seem like I was being told the truth and wasted time over discussing the upgrade. Also I rented thinking I was going to have to return to San Diego but then returned back at Orange County, the rates were like $75-$100 less returning it back to the original location yet I wasn't credited as it wasn't one way as I brought it back to the original location. And I knew this as I checked both rates before I picked up the car--because I could of just rented it round trip and paid the lower rate- it was nearly $100 lower, and decided later and not had dealt with this. When I would call Alamo twice I would get agents from the Philippines or India, I had a *very difficult* time understanding them and communicating. The only thing I think I liked from renting at this location would be that it was in the terminal and the pick up was across the street.</Text><UserId.>107035940963824245714< /UserId.><date>1459427152847< /date><rate>1</rate><Response>{'time': 1460089059700, 'text': 'Karen Cheung, customer service and satisfaction are very important to us at Alamo.

<Review>There were plenty of cars and we received a 2018 model with under 500 miles on it.  The only issue was at check-in.  SNA doesn't have full pre-registration where you can just pick a car from the row.  After pre-registration I still had to go to the counter because the kiosk didn't work correctly.</Review>< Pictures>

After having a not so awesome day, we missed a flight, tried to get a car from our rental company who stated they had nothing on a Saturday. We should have been in Orange county but with the rebooked flight we were in Las Angeles. So they were okay with leaving us stranded unless we wanted to pay another fee for another car to use for 1 hour. So we go to Alamo and they were cheaper and very friendly. The car was extremely clean, looked brand new. And when we got to the airport to pick up our luggage we we're greeted by Chaz who was wonderful. He made sure we had everything, ran though a list of anything we could have forgotten and we did forget something so he saved us! He greeted us with a smile and he was so polite. After the long day we had it was a breath of fresh air. Thank you Alamo!</text>

<review>I have been a loyal Alamo customer for decades and experienced trouble-free experiences throughout a majority of the rentals.  One evening I was involved in a collision while in Hawaii, and that was taken care of with minimal inconvenience, especially since the other party was at fault, honest about his error, and insured.</review>< Pics>

Rent from Alamo quite a few times but this was the first I had to wait for more than 40 minutes. However the attendant was kind to offer us free gas. Will use Alamo again.<//text>

<review>Careful, if you rent with your citi card from Costco, you are fully covered up to 50k for any car. One of the guys there will try to cheat you into buying insurance saying Costco covers only up to anything below full size car.. This is at the Alamo JW Airport..<//review>< Pics>

<Review>I will rent a car there again if I return to John Wayne Airport. Staff was very polite. I prebooked the car via internet and the guy in the booth didn't tried to sell an additional expensive insurance to me, like I often have experienced at other rental agencies. Nor he tried to sell me an upgrade although I only booked an economy class car. Service was fast and without any problems.<//Review>< user_id>

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>Always rent with Alamo through AAA or Costco Travel. Never had problems until this time.

Upon arrival to the rental counter at John Wayne Airport, the poor girl at the counter was by herself, not a soul to help her.  There were about 10 people in line.  It took forever to get to the front of the line. When I finally got to the front of the line, I had a sunburn on the back of my neck from the sun blaring through the glass windows and ceiling around the rental counter area. These kind of things start your vacation off on the wrong side of the road. Lady was friendly and welcoming upon reaching the counter.  She's good.  I would be irritated if I were her.

My rate was all good, then I was offered the gas for 1/2 a tank for $18.00 total. Information given was that gas was very expensive in LA, which I believed and turns out was correct. I agreed to the gas part as we were driving for 5 days only a couple miles from the hotel to Disneyland Park round trip then to Los Angeles on our last day. 1/2 a tank was exactly where we landed upon returning to LAX late in the evening. That is where we were met by some crazed ALAMO return agent outside that just had it in him to argue with me that night. He informed me that instead of the $18.00 for a 1/2 tank, I was being charged about $40.00 or more for the gas. I explained about the $18.00 agreement.  He said that didn't matter anymore because it wasn't on my agreement and I had been upgraded for free so the car type no longer qualified for the $18.00 gas promo. I told him "no, it's on my agreement, and I didn't ask for the upgrade, the lady in the garage at Anaheim just gave it to me because there were no compact cars ready." He kept insisting that I agreed to the upgrade vs. the gas promo.  Should that matter: I didn't know it was one or the other. Never had that problem before. But to my amazement, the gas information wasn't on the contract. Now is when I started to curse in my head that I didn't double check it before I walked away from the counter.  I kept saying to him, that it was agreed upon in Anaheim, and he kept trying to tell me "no, that is not what you are paying." I argued for awhile, but ended up giving up as I didn't want to spoil my last day of vacation. I just walked away.

I come home to check my credit card bill and it was only charged for the original $69.58. WTH!? So what was the purpose of the guy in LA treating me like an idiot and wanting to argue with me.  Shoot, I work for a major hotel chain and can't believe that this guy argued with me...a customer.  If I did that, I would not have a job.

Next car reservation has been made with another major car agency.  I will give them a try.  Let's see if they want to argue with me. One wrong episode and I don't usually return to a business. Save my sanity.</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Traveling throughout the country and Alamo’s pricing has been the same as or better than any of its major competitors.

We rented at SNA for 10 days on the 'Deal" rental where you don't choose your car ahead of time. They gave us a Nissan Altima with 7K miles on it. A very nice car that ran well. We especially like that we can make a reservation, monitor the rates, and when they drop make a new reservation. We did this four times and saved $100. We had only one area where they could do better; the car was dirty on the outside with birds and bugs, but their other services more than made up for that. Thanks Alamo!< /Review>

Reserved and prepaid for a "premium crossover", Infiniti QX60 or similar. Upon arriving, I saw another guy driving off with the Infiniti, probably taking the car I've already reserved for.  And I was correct, they didn't have anything similar to the same class, even had galls to offer me a Ford Edge instead! After insisting that I should get a "premium crossover", they reluctantly gave me a Nissan pathfinder which is obviously a class below Infiniti. In addition, the car wasn't even  vacuumed with food crumbs all over the front passenger area. This is second time I've had a similar experience with Alamo, and will be the last time I will ever rent from Alamo.

UPDATE: Although I initially had unpleasant experience with them, I was kind of surprised someone from the headquarter actually cared to follow up on this internet review and gave me a partial refund, which I thought it was a nice gesture.</text>

Great service on check in.  I was concerned coming in on the late flight we would have issues, but the young gentleman who checked us in was very helpful (even though he was dealing with computer system being down.)  Return was ok - little stressful, we had an early flight and the attendants were not there yet, unclear as to where to park the car and I received a call from the attendant saying they couldn't find the key I left in the dropbox - just as I was walking to the gate.   It all worked out.  I would recommend Alamo - they are inexpensive and the car we rented was very nice for the money (Nissan Sentra)< /review>

Got off the airplane at SNA and went straight to the Alamo desk.  No line ups.  In under 3 minutes I was on my way to pick up my car.  Attendant in parkade gave me two options for vehicles and we were out of parkade and on our way within minutes.  I was impressed as I always have been with Alamo for their courtesy and customer service and efficiency.  Dropped off car in San Diego a week later at the new Car Rental Center close to airport.  This structure has really sped up returning the vehicle at SAN and it's right close to the airport.  Again, within minutes we were on our way to the shuttle and with the same excellent customer service and friendliness.  I book Alamo whenever I can.  I've never been disappointed in my experience with them.</text>

Had prepaid our car reservation for April 2015, so when we arrived at SNA, everything went smoothly.  Attendants at the service desk assisted us almost immediately, and we were in our Rav4 & driving away to our hotel in less than 10 minutes!  Returning the car went just as smoothly.  Will rent from Alamo again in the future.< /Review>

<Text>Zero problems, which is what I like. John Wayne shuts down flights at 11:00 PM, but the Alamo office stayed open for those of us who had reserved starting at 11:00. A line, but they worked efficiently and politely. No surprises on my bill AND they offered a HALF tank of gas, which saved me time and money for my return. Big yay!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>We expected to rent a RAV 4 or equivalent, however we were given a Chevy Escalade. After loaded the vehicle up we decided to complain about the size (i.e. it was way too big for our needs) and they fixed us up with a mid-size SUV without any hassle, except we had to wait for a good 45 minutes.  We were fairly compensated for the wait though as we were told we didn't have to fill the gas tank upon return.  Generally speaking the staff at Alamo were extremely helpful. And they went over and above the expected level of service when they drove us to the airline terminal with our baggage when we returned the rental.  We will definitely consider them when renting our next vehicle.</review>< pictures>

<review>The airport did not have the class of vehicle available that I paid for. I was really disappointed that the selection was next to nothing. I made the reservation well in advance, about a month out. They then offered me a vehicle not anywhere close to what I reserved...I expect more out of this companys staff at John Wayne Airport -Orange County.</review>< gmapID>

<Text>Alamo provided a beautiful 2016 Grand Caravan for my family at a competitive rate. It was a very reliable van & held 6 people (of those, 1 had a five-point harness car seat, 1 booster seat, and 350 lb male) comfortably. It also had stow & go seating which held a double stoller & 9 suitcases (various sizes) including all passengers as described above! Amazing! I needed to extend our reservation & it was simple & efficent. Every customer service rep was professional & knowledgable. Only "complaint" is no one told me it was an E85 fueled vehicle, which was confusing, at first, when I went to fill up the first time. Come to find out you CAN put regular unleaded gas in it, but the road to find that out was scary, while at a gas station on almost empty...trying to make sure I could fill with unleaded without damaging the van.<//Text>< time>

I rented from them 2 weeks in a row, once thru Priceline and once directly thru their website(cheaper thru their site!)  Quick service, easy pick up and drop off. The second time I even got the car I requested, almost unheard of in the world or rental cars.  The experience was so good, I booked an Alamo car for my trip to Hawaii this summer!< /text>

<Review>Booked a car online through Orbitz in a package deal (i.e., air, hotel, car). Arrived and was able to immediately speak with an agent to get the paperwork done, which was quick and straightforward. Went to pick up the car and was offered a "free" upgrade, not sure from what I was upgraded to. Alamo staff were friendly and professional and the whole process went smoothly. I thought the pricing was pretty reasonable as well.

The only comments I would make, and these are relatively minor, at John Wayne Airport I think then need better signage outside to locate the pick up location. The direx from the Alamo desk agent were really unclear, and there is little if any signage outside, had to ask a cop.

Second, I asked about direx to a nearby hotel, no one truly knew and the direx I got from Alamo at the pick up point were so vague they were entirely not helpful... if you don't know where something is, don't send a customer off with bad direx.

Given this, it would be helpful if they had GPSs available for rental as well, this would have been a great opportunity to "up sell".

But all in all, a pretty good experience.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcdef72d684abd:0xe2c3d7e083d3af52</Gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp></record>

I often rent from Alamo. The car was a good vehicle, Chevy Impala, but it was very dirty inside. There where coffee spills on the console, dirty floor boards and dirty glass windows. The checking process is a hassle even after completing pre checking on line.
This would be simple problems to fix.<//review>

No comparison in type of vehicles, customer service and quality of rental Vehicle I would pay a little more with Alamo.  Only one thing, they should keep their damage waiver cost down.  I paid more for the Damage waiver than my rental per day!</text>< pics>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>Alamo lacks knowledgeable people, top to bottom.  We were directed to 2 different websites to pay the highway tolls after our trip in SoCal, only to find that we didn't really didn't need to go the websites at all; the credit card on file gets billed.  Trying to get all this figured out, I finally asked for a manager on their 800#, who, after 15 minutes on the line, disconnected us. It's highly unlikely that I'd ever rent with Alamo again.</review>< Date>

<Text>1) When I arrived to pickup the vehicle I had reserved— NO ONE provided a walk around of the vehicle I was given.   So, I resulted to taking photos of some rear bumper damage I was concerned about.

2) The navigation system  failed 3 days into my 7 day rental period.   The failure was a HUGE issue given that I do not know the area and Orange County is huge with many freeways to navigate!

I reported both issues after a very long period of my call being transferred or I was given another number to call.  So, finally I reached someone at a customer service call-center — the report was taken and that was all.   I WAS EXTREMELY UNSATISFIED with the lack of concern- so much for CUSTOMER SERVICE!   I would have pursued this more but I was dealing with a family crisis involving a ailing parent.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dcdef72d684abd:0xe2c3d7e083d3af52< /gmap_id>< resp>
