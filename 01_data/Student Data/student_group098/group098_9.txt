We love the program. Thanks to the staff, who made it so that we could finally afford to get to Hawaii. We'd been trying for years, and had not been able to afford it. Thank you!!!<//Review>

So here we are, and it's renewal time.  I received many, I mean many phone calls from TT.  Now keep in mind our nation shut down and was not able to travel, but I maintain paying my bill.  Time to renew,  and finally getting to speak with a human I'm told this.  In order to get the 3 months, you will need to pay another annual fee.  TT, how about this, instead of your customers coming out to the pocket to pay $300 dollars, why don't you offer a deal since we Americans were not able to travel (unless you are rich).  I feel that you are not taking into consider the working middle class folks that maintain their accounts in spite of what we Americans (TT members had to experience not being able to travel).  I want to travel, but I didn't want to take the chance and find myself dead. I am asking that you take my situation into consideration, and provide me with a discount for the renewal and the three months for free.  If you truly appreciate your customers that should be real easy.  So what do you say?</Text>

I have been a member for almost 2 years and I have enjoyed all my savings! I have traveled more now since it is so much cheaper to travel at wholesale cost! The platform is easy to use and very user friendly. The BEST part is I have used so many timeshare weeks without paying any maintenance fees or buying the timeshare from $200-$300 per week! AMAZING!!</text>

I was called from a local phone number and the person identified herself from United Airlines.
I was lured into their grand opening for their new travel center and I would receive as a gift 2 airlines tickets plus hotel stay, completely free.
I was transferred to their manager to confirm their requirements, then another person called me to receive a confirmation code and offered me a complementary $100 dining card.
Here is the FRAUD/SCAM: They are travel transparency club preview center, they have been open for years... you have to endure a long presentation on their travel platform and pushed to buy a membership for $10K (it will go down if you say no) plus annual fees. Back at home I did compare the prices shown on their PPT presentation with priceline, tripmasters, TripAdvisor.... and they are soooooo overpriced.
The free airlines tickets.... comes with unreasonable conditions, including a $250 taxes and fees per person and mailing a $100 and $75 cashiers check;  is almost impossible to book.
The $100 dining card are coupons, several coupons

Regardless that I asked to each person if they were calling from United Airlines or it was a third party administrator or a marketing company; they all answered they were from the new Travel Center in Oceanside from United airlines.

It is misleading, fraudulent, abusive and absolutely wrong their tactics to attract new “clients” to SCAM  and they are 100% responsible for their marketing

About the 5 Star reviews.... they will offer more “free incentives” if you leave a 5 star review....<//Text>

My experience with this website was great! I’ve used it multiple times and my stays at the hotels on the website were all pleasant, and they were even at a reasonable price. The website was also user friendly so it was easy for me to find the right hotel for my budget. All the hotels were managed well, clean, and had good customer service. I am looking forward to my next vacation!<//review>

This place is a total scam. I was contacted by a marketing company who offered me 3 days, 2 nights hotel stay at anywhere in the continental united states as well as 2 free airline tickets to anywhere in the continental united states to listen to a 90 minute presentation with no obligation to buy anything. They said it was a grand opening for a travel agency.

The sales person was nice. We listened to the presentation and felt pressured to finance a membership (which we didn't do). It was NOT a grand opening (they had been open over a year). They gave us a gift receipt with MANY conditions; including, only traveling on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday to a limited number of cities. And guess what...it wasnt free! It was $199 per person plus a $50 processing fee. $450 of free!

They were taking advantage of many retirees as well. The prices for what they were offering kept moving with the conversation. So annoying.<//Review>

Going to Disneyland and staying for two nights was easy with my Travel Transparency  membership. Staying at the Hilton two blocks from Disney Village  was wonderful. Saving $270.00 on that hotel stay Palm Sunday was AWESOME.  I love the fact that I do not have compromise on quality because of affordability or dates. I go when I want, and all at wholesale prices. European  River Cruise here I come.< /Review>

Hi highly recommend that you work with a US based or local telemarketing service if you must use one. Nowadays with all the scams going around people are concern and lack trust about any free offer. Since you are a local business you should have no problem connecting with the community in much more trustworthy  manner.
Best of luck.</review>

The marketing company that called me said they were "Southwest Airlines" and that I would receive two round trip tickets for free plus 3 days 2 nights hotel stay to listen to their presentation. Come to find out the tickets are not free and can only be used on a Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays and you have to return in two days. You leave after 3pm and have to return the morning of the 3rd day, so where ever you go you would only have one full day at your destination. No thanks!

The timeshare seems like a good value, just wish they didn't use lying marketing companies to get you in the door. Travel Transparency should also give you what was promised for viewing the presentation. I was also promised upon arrival dining coupons, which I did not receive. Just the fact that they don't deliver what they promise makes me question this company's ethics. I was going to research another travel company and compare but not anymore. If you can't be up front and honest with your initial promises you're not the type of company I want to do business with.</text>

< Review>
This company made it easy to come in, listen to their pitch and make an informed decision. After weighing everything out and considering the fact that I want to travel with my family at least once a year, it became a no brainer. If you travel, or even plan to, it’s certainly worth checking out. The best part was the rep didn’t pressure the decision, they presented the facts and we acted!<//Review>

< Review>
Got a call to listen to a presentation on a wholesale travel membership.  The 3 day 2 night weekend will be nice as we will go to Nashville for the first time. Btw this is a separate promotional company.

The bonus is we signed up and our family will be able to enjoy the member benefits for life!  $50/night for some very nice resorts in Cabo, Vegas, or many places in the world is an example.  Cruises at 25-50% less than lowest listed price as well.  Many other member benefits as well. I’d recommend going in and listening to what these folks have to offer.  No high pressure sales at all.  If you like what they have to offer sign up. If not, follow the steps for your promotional weekend away including hotel and airfare for a few hundred bucks.  We will be booking our first cruise soon!

Robbie, Lisa, et al are very knowledgeable friendly with many years of travel industry experience between them!

I’d recommend sitting down and listening to what these folks have to offer.

<text>Leif and Robbie were really nice and cute and they answered all of our questions and worked with us until we created a plan that worked for us. They made the experience fun but even if they weren’t fun and cute, we would have purchased anyway because this service is absolutely worth it - hands down - if you travel, or even if you just want to travel, you need this service!!! It is worth it at any price!!!<//text>< name>

Interesting concept.  If you travel frequently for vacations it might be for you.  The up front commitment is not cheap. If you’re looking just to snag a couple of “FREE” airline tickets just for showing up, think again.  Think again.  Restrictions make near impossible to book anything worth while.</review>

<review>SCAM ALERT!!!!!

They called me out of the blue and offered me 2 free airline tickets AND hotel accommodations if I go to their "Celebration Event" and when I wouldn't give them my live-in gf name without her consent, they hung up on me. Even after I requested they use my name and plus one. I even said they could verify that we both have THE SAME house address.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rate>1</rate>< gmapID>

<text>It is illegal to call people from a spoofed phone number. A call from 501-2 came in and I spoke to “Kim” who was phishing for personal information by telling me I had won two Delta Airlines tickets. What a scam. Rest assured, you guys have been reported to the FCC.

Your “free trip” will cost you $75 per person  at least to stay in a Motel 6 in your chosen destination. And I will take a heckuva lot of work on your part navigating the restrictions to finally try and make any reservations. The “open house with a 20 minute video” that was mentioned in the phone call is actually: 30 mins of an appointment with a “host” and painfully awkward small talk (where they’re trying to pull information out of you to see if you can afford their program essentially), a preview of their website, and a 45 minute PowerPoint presentation on timeshares, and will end with a hard, hard sell. They will try to sell you a “new and improved timeshare option“  for thousands of dollars where you don’t really own anything, but you’re basically buying access to cheaper prices, and more flexibility - the ability to use their proprietary system to still then buy discounted, wholesale priced travel rooms/activities. Yes, you will save money. And instead of 90 minutes where whatever they promised you, it’ll probably take at least three hours and they will keep going back-and-forth trying to sell it to you even though you said no 50 different ways.  However, if you do keep saying they’ll they’ll reduce the price from $8000 to $1000. It’s a big joke and a massive waste of time.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

We listened to their sales pitch and decided against handing over $8,000. I was not comfortable with making an on the spot financial commitment. Glad I did not, too. Afterwards I learned that their gift incentives were highly misleading. They promised a $100 dining gift card and 2 free airline tickets to any CONUS destination. The dining card turned out to be a bunch of discount coupons and the airline tickets require you to register by mail and send a $100 cashier's check. Makes you question the integrity of this business.< /review>

Travel Transparency in itself is a cool business idea. They do require an up-front cost, ranging from $3k - $10k, to basically give you membership and access to discounted hotels, time shares, houses etc. . . Sometimes the price for a full week (for a hotel or time share) is around $200. This is an insanely good deal.

There's a yearly fee of $150, and if there wasn't a $3k initial investment my wife and I would have jumped on it. This private membership does offer some great prices on vacations. So the initial investment ($3k - $10k) could make A LOT of sense, and save you a lot of money if you're going to travel a good amount.

My issue is mostly with their marketing company. They got my wife and I to show up. So kudos to that. They did their job. But we asked several times about the details of the "round trip airfare". We were told we won free tickets from Delta and could fly anywhere in the continental US. We asked about restrictions and the marketing company said we would receive an email with all details. The email we got just further highlighted that we would get 2 round trip tickets and 2 nights in a hotel! Sounds great right? **Terms and conditions apply** But they do charge $75/person in gov't fees and $75/person in a "reservation fee". We thought, "ok, if we can fly from San Diego to New York for $150/person, that's still pretty good". Because of this, we went through the presentation, which was well done. Very nice people. No complaints in the presentation. I just wish they would have told us about the flight restrictions up front.

After the presentation we get our "voucher" for the plane tickets:

**Valid for Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday Departure dates only**
**you are required to send $100 cashiers check to CasablancaExpress to request your travel dates**
** The $100 cashiers check is refundable 30 days AFTER you complete your travel**
**After Casablanca gets your $100 cashiers check. They send you a reservation letter that you must complete with your requested departure dates. You must send this back with $75/person reservation fee**
**You must provide THREE different departure dates at least 60 days in advance of your first date and 30 days between subsequent dates**
**You must provide at least one alternate destination**
**All reservations are subject to availability**

These last few qualifications makes planning a trip really hard. This makes me assume that CasablancaExpress (who you're sending $100 to, then $75/person to) gets to pick any of the 3 dates (within a 3 month range) that you provided, and either to your preferred destination OR the backup destination?? I'm assuming they will just pick the worst/cheapest date, and the cheaper destination.

Departing flights are between 3-10 and return flights are between 6am - 1.

Your tickets will be mailed at least 10 days prior to your arrival date. . .

All of this would have been good to know BEFORE agreeing to the meeting. This is what should have been provided in the email. I understand that Travel Transparency can kinda blame this on "their marketing companies" But if they don't know what their marketing companies are telling their future customers, theres a little bit of blame on Travel Transparency for that. . .

For a company called travel TRANSPARENCY, this was not a good start to doing business with them.

The flight/hotel deal has wayyy too many *send me money first by mail cashiers check* *send me more money by mail with 3 different dates that they get to choose* -- WAY TOO COMPLICATED for a company who is trying to make travel easier by just going online and booking a vacation. I feel like their promotion should be in-line with their business model. Not something that will be extremely hard to plan around (what am I suppose to ask my boss for 3 different travel dates for 3 subsequent months and be like "yeah boss sorry, I'm going on a vacation, but i dont know when yet, can i get march 3-7, april 3-7 and May 3-7 off please?".)

I wish the business success because I like the business model. They need to change their marketing plan</Text>

Clean establishment with nice people. I would say their pricing is reasonable and very comparable with other salons in the area.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I gave it 4 stars for the cleanliness and customer service. I don't remember the lady who did my nails, but she was so focused, detailed and delicate. I get scared seeing the tools because I'm scared I'll get cut due to past experiences, but she never took her eyes off my fingers. They wipe down all stations before you are seated, and are great at communicating when you call or walk in. I just wish they had more options for gel and powder colors and updated there designs to what is trending. This is what I ended up with, which is nice, but initially not the color I wanted.</review>< rate>

< Review>
I'm really disappointed in this place I've been coming to this place for almost 10 years. Because there are FEW people who do a good job. I had given this place 3 chances before I decided to give up. The last two times I made appointments the first one I made when I was here the second I called.... I came both times and they didn't even put me down and was a 1hour and 45 minutes wait. The last time I made the appointment the morning of thinking it would be fresh in their memory I made an appointment I get here and I told them I had an appointment all they said was oh okay.... here I am a hour waiting.<//Review>

< review>
Price was great, service was awesome, Jaquelin was OUTSTANDING!!!!  I showed up right at closing for a fill, and my nails were a mess from the salon I had them done at previously. Not only did they take me, but even well after closing and I was the only customer still there they gave me the same quality of service as if I had been the first customer of the day. The service I received was not rushed nor uncomfortable, but most impressive and absolutely most appreciated of all was the attention to detail Jaquelin paid to my nails. She listened to the complaints I had with the way my nails were done from a different salon and did a beautiful job of correcting every last one!!!! My nails look fantastic!! Im VERY PLEASED!!! Thank you Jaquelin!<//review>

Honestly, i was really nervous on how they were going to come out. I really left satisfied with not only my manicure but also my pedicure which i was not planning on getting. I will come back again the lady that did my nails unfortunately i didn't get her name did an amazing job. She had lots of patience. She did not once male me.feel uncomfortable

<review>I came for the first time for a mani-pedi. Since it was not busy I expected for the service and finished product to look nice. It felt like this lady was in a rush, I don't know for what because no one came in until I sat down to dry my nails. She didn't even take off all of the old glitter polish completely.  And it was $28 for a mani-pedi for rushed service and an old massage chair. Sorry will not be back.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c34d3475ea74dd:0x3b3626b30c6ab12f<//gmap_id></record>

<review>I’ve lived in a few different states and Dr. Duenas is my favorite chiropractor I’ve seen throughout the years. He cares about his patients and is willing to go the extra mile to teach people how they can help themselves. If you get the chance, take one of his trigger point classes, where you can really learn to care for your body and resolve some issues on your own. I used to go for adjustments much more regularly, but I’ve gotten to a point where I don’t need to go as frequently.

His staff is incredible, and I highly recommend Cynthia if you are in need of a massage. She knows all the tricks to help relieve pain and release problem areas, not to mention she’s just the sweetest.< /review>< Pics>

I started coming here when I was about 20 weeks pregnant because I started having lower back pain. I’m so thankful I found Performance Chiroptactic because Dr. Duenas provided me with so much relief! He does great adjustment and also teaches you what’s going on in the body and things you can do at home. It’s obvious he loves his job and truly cares about his patients. The massage therapist, Cynthia, is amazing! She did several prenatal massages during my pregnancy. They helped so much.</text>

I was in constant pain for over 2 weeks and would wake up in tears every night. The pain and ache I felt on my shoulder, neck and back was radiating down to my elbow. I was unable to use my left arm or move my neck. I came to Dr. Duenas and he recommended Fascial treatment. During my treatment he explained everything in great detail and made sure I was doing okay throughout the treatment. After the treatment I felt instant relief and was able to move my neck. As the days went by I felt great, it was like I was never in pain. Here I am a few weeks later and I haven't had any pain or aches come back nor linger. Fascial treatment is the best treatment I have received and I truly recommend it. Dr. Duenas is the Best Chiropractor I have been seen and his office staff Cynthia is always very pleasant and helpful. I highly recommend Performance Chiropractic to anyone looking for a Chiropractor.<//Text>

< Review>
Erin, Cynthia and The Doc (Dr. Duenas) are hands down A+MAZING! As soon as you walk in they are inviting and greet you by name. The staff is very knowledgeable and provide self-care options for everyday care & most importantly very professional. I wouldn't go or recommend anywhere else in the AV for Chiropractic Care. #goteamPerformanceChiropractic< /Review>

<Review>We love Dr D. He has been very patient with me and all my questions. He goes above and beyond to help you find the issues and understand how to take care of them. He is more than just a chiropractor. My kids are on the very affordable kids plan and love him. Jessica does my massages and she's great. It's amazing the strength that comes out of such a sweet and petite person. I've been to several chiropractors that have been good but this one has been a great fit for our family. Check them out!!!! You'd be amazed at how much your spine controls your health.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Dr Rick was recommended by my therapyst. I had issues with my spine and my elbows.

Dr. Rick discovered I had other issues besides the normal adjustments and recommended I see an orthopaedist. His diagnosis was correct. He could have just continued with the adjustments but my well being was his concern not his pockets. I am happy to say that I no longer have any issues with my elbows and he has rid me of back pain. I can now golf and exercise without discomfort.

His staff is courteous, facility is immaculate, and his concerns are for his patients health.
His professionalism reflects credit upon his self and his establishment. I have recommended him to all my friends and will continue this practice in the future.

My thanks to Dr. Rick, Jessica and Staff!!!

<text>I scheduled 3 full body massages on 07/25/2015 with Cynthia for myself and 2 other friends. We were very pleased with her promptness, her professionalism and her attention to detail. She asks you about the pressure throughout the massage to assure the pressure is sufficient. I will be back. Thank you Cynthia.</text>< user>

I've been going to Dr D on and off for close to 5 years now and I can honestly say that he takes the time to listen to my concerns and thoroughly educates me on why I have pain, how it gets aggravated, and what I can do to alleviate it. I never feel as if I am getting the same treatment as anyone else. Today, I did the foam rolling class to learn how to relieve my own trigger points. It hurts so good!! I walk out feeling refreshed. I always highly recommend Performance Chiropractic to all of my friends and family.< /review>

<review>I wish I would have listened to my coach and came in a lot sooner. I have been here twice to get worked on and will continue to do so. I am in and out in a timely manner, the staff especially Jessica are friendly and welcoming, and answer questions efficiently. Dr Rick Dueñas explained everything in a way that was easy for me to understand. He spent time with me during my initial consultation, and they were able to see me the same day to get worked on. I feel 10xs better since going in for my adjustments.<//review>< user_id>

<review>Jenny is my favorite Masseuse! She finds knots I didn't know I had so when I leave I feel so much relief. I carry my stress in my neck and shoulders and I leave feeling so relaxed and ready to take on the world. Jenny listens to what I want/need and does exactly that. When I tell her it hurts, she keeps at it, knowing that I need it and when I tell her it's too much she backs off a bit. Always get my money's worth with Jenny. Thank you soooooo much!< /review>< date>

He has the best staff!! They were very friendly and I received nothing but the BEST service and treatment!!! They have definitely helped me so much, my pain has been minimized and I will definitely be back for monthly adjustments, I wouldn't go anywhere else! They made me feel like family, and I will be referring my friends and family to this office! Thank you Dr. Duenas and Jessica for helping me out!

Excellence at its best!
I have been seeing Dr. Duenas for over a year now and am extremely pleased with his expertise as well as the staff! They are always welcoming and provide excellent service, not too mention i always leave their office feeling 100% better than when i came in. I used to visit his office twice a week to relieve my pain and now i only go 1 time a week and/or as needed. I also have taken his foam rolling class to help work out my pain at home which has made a tremendous difference in my pain levels! They have massages, which are very reasonably priced and are better than at a day spa in my opinion. I would (and have) highly recommend Performance Chiropractic to anyone needing pain relief! Thanks Dr. Duenas and staff, you guys are the best!</Text></record></dataset><record>
<text>I've been going to Dr. Duenes for about 5 years.  I have been in a couple car accidents where I've injured my neck,  and chiropractic care is the only thing that helps!  Dr. D is very personable, and knowledgeable.<//text>< rate>

<Name>Lynelle DeRoo<//Name><rating>5<//rating><review>You are in *very* good hands with "Dr. D" and Jessica. I go in with a cane to walk, and leave without needing it. I love the heat and the roller table. He accommodates whatever disabilities I may have that day and adjusts without hurting me.

Dr Duenas:  Great skill, explains well, experience, prompt--doesn't make me wait forever to see me either when I am needing an appointment or in the office, helpful in any way he can, generous, professional, warm hands (freezing hands I've had, and that's not helpful when you need an adjustment), and humorous.

Jessica:  Cheery personality, fun, remembers my name/background, great conversationalist, EXCELLENT massage therapist!, funny, thorough, professional, perceptive, down-to-earth, generous, heart-centered, thoughtful, did I say EXCELLENT massage therapist? oh yes, she's the best...lol.

I've had back issues since 1991. I've seen a dozen chiropractors all over (CA, Alaska, Virginia). Some have helped, some have hurt, some have REALLY hurt! Dr. Duenas is the FIRST and only to stretch and massage my neck after an adjustment so I didn't have a throbbing headache when I leave. That's huge. I've never let anyone do my neck because of how it feels torqued and hurts afterward--except him.

I always look forward to going in to see them. I've known them since 2010. They make a great professional team and I am so happy to see their success and growth.</review>< Resp>

<user>115861869874269684777< /user><Review>I strongly recommend Dr. Dueñas.   I started my chiropractic care with him 4 months ago since I could barely walk because of my lower back problems.  I was limited in what I was able to do.  Most importantly I was unable to play with my nieces and nephews without any pain.  Since I started going to Dr. Dueñas I immediately felt very comfortable and started getting educated in how I can help myself and my body.  He is very understanding and caring for his patients.  He has amazing staff that will always make you feel at home.  Driving from San Fernando every week was not an issue since I knew he was helping me be pain free.  Not only do I feel 100 times better from my back but I also became and exercise addict.  I'm able to do my normal activities with no pain and most importantly no medication.  I will always recommend Dr. Dueñas to all my friends.</Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< gmap_id>

They're not rude, they've always treated me well.  I've been to places where they're rude and bothered with customers... These guys had a good attitude with a beginner like me.  The price is what it is, pretty much everywhere. So the big difference is service = their good attitude. Don't forget to bring your ears & eyes ;)< /review>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>Not a super fancy place, some of the staff can be a little dry sometimes, but certainly not rude.  This place serves its purpose well, prices seem reasonable, seem to be open lanes when I go, they seem to take safety seriously but not in a tension causing manner.  Nice balance of diligence and accommodation.  Good to go.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I, like everyone else it seems, am trying to find a handgun and also a rifle. I was getting set to join the club to go shooting because they have perks for members. The range was okay, seemed typical for a few that I have been to over the years which isn't many but it doesn't take a whole lot to figure it out.
The staff however is a bit on the 'pithy' side. Two or maybe three conversations on the phone left me not feeling like I want to join. Mind you, it is a financial commitment, aka, not cheap.
On the positive note, the help at the range was good. At least, the one time I was there. I will continue to shop as the California legislature makes it impossible to shoot or buy ammo. Too bad the service didn't leave me with the feeling of wanting to get more serious. On the other hand, maybe it is better off. I will use my cell phone for help and then throw my phone at the perpetrator.< /Review>

I went here just to inquire about getting a new membership, but the staff was so friendly and helpful that I ended up buying a handgun at the same time.  The staff was knowledgeable and explained to me all about gun legalities in California.  I would definitely recommend this place not only for target practice, but for sales and services as well.< /text>

Take safety very serious (which is a good thing).  Reasonably priced, glad they had rentals (pistols and rifles).  Clean, efficient, and friendly.  Enjoyed our shoot that day!<//review>

I like this place to shoot during the week and after work. Prices are not bad, safety is stressed but shoved down your throat. The gun selection is very limited compared to my previous visits to the store.</Text>

<text>Not only a great gun range, but a classic -- perfect. Old, nondescript building, nothing fancy, but everything you'd need or want. Fourteen lanes, good assortment of range guns for rental, outstanding staff with a significant depth of knowledge. This is a place to treasure, it's that good. Other gun ranges are imitations of ASC.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dbffb2b82ab841:0x30361dd2c94a52b4< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I WENT IN TO THIS GUN SHOP 3 YEARS AGO WITHOUT MUCH EXPERIENCE AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE EDUCATION THEY PROVIDED ME. I NOW FEEL I CAN HANDLE A FIREARM SAFELY AND WITH CONFIDENCE. I HAVE SINCE THEN BEEN TO MULTIPLE GUN SHOPS AROUND FROM SAN DIEGO TO ORANGE COUNTY AND THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST PROFESSIONAL AND POLISHED GUN STORES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I CONTINUE TO SHOP HERE FOR MY FIREARMS AND I JUST RECENTLY GOT A MEMBERSHIP. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ASC TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES GUNS AND ESPECIALLY YOUNG ENTHUSIAST WHO ARE GETTING INTO THE HOBBY.<//Review>

The service was definitely very accommodating and easy to deal with.  I guess it just really depends on when and what time of day you go, but on  Tuesday afternoon, one can't complain.  Thanks guys!</review>

This "one star" is based upon today's terminal negative experience.  The experience of the previous 6+ years is more like "4, then increasing slightly over several years."   Helpful staff.  Staff had continually improved as they finally got rid of some of the rude long time employees.

I have been buying an annual membership at ASC for six years, renewing each June.  I recently renewed in mid June, 2017, for the beginning of the 7th year.

I had recently been to the range at ASC for target shooting, about 10 days or possibly 2 weeks ago.

Wednesday, Sept 6, 2017, I arrived at ASC to find a gutted building !!   Not even a sign on the door, which would tell customers, and paid members, about this sudden, unannounced closure.

Then I called the ASC phone number, only to reach a non-message voice mail which said nothing at all about what has taken place.

No previous indication that they were soon to be shutting down business, even though I was there recently.   ASC ownership has skipped out.

ASC should return a pro-rated remainder of the money they charged me for a one year membership. ASC took money for my membership, which they had no intention of fulfilling.

Disabled Vet, with multiple physical problems, on a fixed low income.

ASC should be honest and forthright, by not avoiding responsibility for problems their abrupt actions cause.

Don't skip out - - and give me back my money.

The customer service and care is mind blowing, I was getting daily updates on what stage the car is at. Quick responses to my questions. I am very impressed.
The facility is clean, staff is friendly and go over the details. The work done was tremendous. Car was delivered clean and feeling like new. Cannot recommend enough.
Thank you!</text>

Their internal program call Perfect 10 is only for surface looking instead for doing the real audit on theircompany. There is no improvement within this Perfect 10 rating program after reaching them. I boughtmy car to this auto body the shop for repair. It come out to be very disappionted to me because thedamage parts have not been fully repair but they are charging for the fully prices. The waiting time isextremly long, I have been waiting from the morning to the afternoon is just for scheduling anappointment.Friendly reminder: Record the interior and exterior of your car before handling over to auto repair shop.Check it carefully and be wisely to choose the shop.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRGPoHyx4W1QqxTFKswQWB947tHlC2LpphCmJD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808f872597387571:0x877237350356d5e8< /GmapID></record>

My experience CARSTAR Chilton Auto Body Oakland was  excellent. I was treated with professionalism and respect. They kept me up to date by phone calls and text on the status of my car. They also kept the date of completion exactly as they quoted to me. Everything was great from start to finish.</review>

<Text>Brought my civic in through Geico. A snowplow hit my car (I moved from Chicago...)and I needed to repair both doors on the driver's side.  They got it done in a week, and washed and vacuumed my car.  It looks wonderful! Very polite and friendly staff.  Also, price was reasonable considering the work and time put in. Definitely recommend this shop!< /Text><response>None<//response>< name>

<Text>I would give them zero starts but this system won't let me. My wife and I showed up at 4:15 pm to turn my car in, which I had prearranged, and the lady I spoke to had an attitude, would not accept my car, took a bunch of pictures for her adjuster and asked for the registration. I have worked with Auto body shops multiple times in the past and have never had someone be so rude to me and ask for my registration.  The turn in was arranged by my insurance company and confirmed by my wife.  Because of this I took my business elsewhere and spoke with my insurance company and told then not to send business there either. This is such a shame because I have had business with them in the past but did not recognize anyone there when I showed up this time.  They also sent my wife into a dark and empty office and no one came to talk to her.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This was my 2nd time returning to this shop in Oakland.  I expected more quality but felt I sent my car though a Mc Dondalds drive thru.  Ask for work that got no attention.  They were more interested in speeding my cat through w/o care.</Text>

poor customer service. I put my car over 1 month. They change 4 times of my estimated  date. And they send messages to me for pick up, after I get there, they told me need more day for fix. I never see the shop like that. I never return.<//Text>

<review>The work done was good, but the service and communication was awful. When I brought it in for an estimate, I was told the work would be done in 4 days. After I brought the car in, I did not receive any communication on the status of the car. When I called on day 3, I was told that it would not be done until day 5. When I called on day 5, I was told it would not be done until day 9. When I called on day 9, they were actually irritated and said, "We'll call you when it's ready." They called me 40 minutes before they closed. How is someone supposed to plan to get a car with 40 minutes notice? This really messed up my schedule for a whole week. People are not friendly and not communicative.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808f872597387571:0x877237350356d5e8< /GmapID></record>

<Review>Very poor customer service.  They had my car for three weeks.  Poor communication and no updates throughout the process. They take customers for granted and seem uninterested in providing quality service.  You feel unwelcomed when you walk through the door.  This unhappy customer will not return.</Review><Time>1493738554790</Time></record>

Over the last 2 months, I experienced an unfortunate situation with my car. My brother had recently used Chilton for his autobody needs and suggested I try them for mine. Throughout the entire experience, Chilton Autobody was phenomenal! Every employee I dealt with was always friendly and helpful, which is much appreciated as this can all be very confusing and it's hard to find people you can trust or good customer service these days. From day 1, Bobby Carter at Chilton in Oakland was my trusted advisor and the customer service I experienced was exceptional! I pulled in to the auto body shop frantic over what was going on with my car and he immediately put me at ease and never once rushed me or lost his patience with me. He let me ask ALL my questions and answered them thoughtfully and thoroughly and it allowed me to fully understand what was going on. This is NOT my area of expertise, but it is extremely important to have as much information as you can and I am so thankful for the good folks at Chilton taking such good care of their customers. I will never go anywhere else for my autobody needs and I want to ensure I highly recommend this exceptional business to others who have those needs! THANK YOU, CHILTON, and THANK YOU for employing Bobby Carter! His customer service deserves to be commended!!!<//text>

(Translated by Google) The place itself, I do not have a direct opinion of them, but of the auto insurance representatives exactly GEICO.
I have this insurance and I really have a very bad experience with them.
In my opinion they are only pretty commercials and pure scam.

(Original)
El lugar en sí, no tengo una opinión directa de ellos, pero si de los representantes de seguros de autos exactamente GEICO.
Yo tengo esta aseguranza y realmente tengo muy mala experiencia con ellos.
En mi opinión solo son comerciales bonitos y pura estafa.</Review>

If I could give 0 I would! The barista that made my coffee was rude and absolutely has no idea how to make coffee. They were down right disgusting! They both were typical signature coffees that should've been easy to make but it was just terrible and undrinkable.

I tried to give her a chance to fix the order and all she did was hand me a small cup with sf vanilla. Ended up having to throw away our drinks and waste our money. Never ever have I tasted anything so bad! No flavor whatsoever! Do better! Train them better to do their job with the prices you gouge from the passengers of your airport.</review>

I visited here this morning. Thought I try one of the  holiday turkey sandwiches. I ask for the sandwich uncooked so I can take it and warm later on. The cashier told me that I couldn’t do that. I couldn’t understand when the sandwiches are offered in the fridge area in other Starbucks. I started to decline the sandwich but she already opened it. How it is your discretion but it cooked or not. Not sure if it’s because the Starbucks is inside the JOhn Wayne airport. But it was ridiculous.<//text>

Very unhappy with the service I received. I ordered a drink & toasted croissant. I received my croissant & waited a long time for my coffee. People that ordered their drinks well after me - their names were being called to pick up their drinks. I asked the staff about my coffee, & was informed that she didn't receive a cup for me. 😑 So, how is it that nobody else had this problem the entire time (over an hour) I waited in the airport? (My gate was next to Starbucks). NOTE:  I believe Diversity & Customer Service training(s) are very much needed. 😐< /Text>

Another Starbucks in the airport messed up my order and the barista argued with me that I didn’t know what I was talking about. I just happened to walk by and see this Starbucks and ask if they could correct my order. The barista was SO KIND and remade my order even though it was not his mistake. THANK YOU!</Review>

<text>Very busy Starbucks with up to 20 people in the line and only one barista preparing drinks.  Drink and food quality is excellent.  Waiting in the line for one half hour is not so excellent.   There are 3 Starbucks in the airport so quickly walk to another location which is not so busy.<//text></record></dataset><record>

If I can do zero stars I would. customer service here is terrible   (AMY) is the worst one of all when it comes to customer service she is extremely rude! I cannot express how RUDE and unprofessional she is not only to myself but to everyone ,I've seen her interact with other customers she is very impatient with people and you can just hear the frustration in her voice as she takes peoples orders. I work at the airport so I've seen it happen way to much! Not worth spending my money here. I just rather drive to a nearby Starbucks outside the airport, During my 30min breaks, than to order from this location again.<//text>

<text>The staff here is horrible! I typically don't write reviews, but I am disgusted with how rude they are for such a small airport. Because they're inside Security they are one of the only options for coffee/breakfast which made it worse.< /text><GmapID>0x80dcdeedce394bb5:0xd59c35d97e5d79c3</GmapID><rating>1< /rating>< Time>

I worked for Starbucks for 4 years, various stores across Southern California. This has SOME of the WORST baristas ever. Customer service is not their strong suit. I don’t usually leave reviews but just finished this order and the girl had such an attitude I decided to leave a review. —— horrible horrible service, the drinks aren’t made according to sbux guidelines, bad attitude, customers next to me we’re becoming upset as well. Considering they charge a premium because of being in an airport you’d think you’d get what you pay for. Avoid avoid avoid.</review>

Just when you need something Gluten Free, it is not made available to travelers in an airport!  I had a wonderful ham & egg and cheese GF sandwich earlier this week in a free standing Starbucks which really met a need, but could not be found in the airport 😢when we are confined without being able to search for safe items to eat!<//Text>

This is like the worst Starbucks ever. It’s like the Latina gang who are incredibly rude and they speak bad of people in Spanish thinking they don’t understand bc they look white. I’m latino and it’s so embarrassing for them. I love reggaeton like the next guy but they blast it and sing along with it while they ignore you. Fly out of SNA weekly and have never seen a smile on these ladies faces. They constantly ignore you and pretend they don’t hear you. If I didn’t have to go to this Starbucks would never go. Maybe I’ll just make coffee at home.<//text>

Slow - this location opened 20 minutes late. The line was 27 people deep and the employees just casually walked around setting up the store. They opened 20 minutes late - and made the worst latte ever.<//review>

The girl who took my order was not very friendly. She called me "hun" with nearly every single sentence. After I got my drink (which was overbearingly sweet although I'd asked for less sweetener pumps than the usual number), I sat down and listened to her other customer interactions. This woman came up and asked for hot water. As the girl was filling the cup she asked if the woman wanted it all the way to the top. However the woman couldn't hear her and answered wrong each time until the girl spoke up. After the woman left, the Starbucks girl proceeded to make fun of the woman, loud enough for anyone in the vicinity to hear. Not very professional or even called for in my opinion.</text>

My husband asked her politely to warm his cinnamon roll and she responded in a rude manner "give me a second" not even a well-mannered "yes or of course," that is the least they can do for the high prices they charge for coffee. We're so disappointed that Starbucks doesn't train its front staff to have a suitable customer service.<//review>< Pictures>

Came here before my flight took off and I was surprised by how rude the staff was. My double shot espresso turned out to be a strawberry acai refresher, which is most definitely not what I had ordered.<//Text>

< Review>
I'm sorry but this was the worst service and drink I've ever received. I ordered a skinny mocha frap but was made a regular mocha hot. Told the barista that I ordered skinny mocha frap and he went to make it and then came back and said they didn't have the sugar free product. So I settled for a regular mocha frap and is was so bland, tasted like blended ice. So I stirred it and let it sit to melt some, and stirred it again and it didn't help. I have never received a Starbucks coffee that tasted so bad I had to throw it away. Yes, I threw it out it tasted so bad. I had chosen Starbucks over McDonald's coffee because I didn't want their high sugar frap ... Wish I would've just gotten it ... I know it's good!</Review>

Get your coffee somewhere else before coming into the airport here. They somehow lost a whole stack of drink orders in the middle of morning rush. Customers had to re-ask the barista for what they ordered after a long wait. Failure.</Text>

< review>
Mangold had been managing our properties for years. When my mother developed dementia they took excellent and compassionate care of her. They made sure her mortgage was paid, kept track of her insurance and taxes, kept track of her. I was living far away and Mangold gave me peace of mind. After she passed one of the staff who became close to her came to the funeral and comforted me. I continued the management of the properties she left me to them. They take the same great care of me and they did of her. One of my homes needed extensive work after she passed and they have been overseeing the project. I'm still distant so having Mangold take care of everything and keeping me informed has been a blessing. They are like family and I couldn't keep my properties without them.< /review>

<text>We have been using Mangold to manage our properties for years and they've been a godsend. We were local to the area but I'm now out of town and if not for Mangold, I wouldn't be able to hold on to the properties. The rental income I receive is my retirement and Mangold allows me to forget I even have rental properties. They allow me to live a peaceful life. The tenants are well taken care of, the properties are well maintained and Craig has been incredibly informative over the course of Covid.<//text>< time>

I lived in one of their apartments for a year. They worked to get me into it fast since I had to start working right away. Then when I would have a minor issue, they would dispatch someone that same morning. But the best thing is, I got my full security deposit back. I didn’t damage the apartment and used their suggested apartment cleaners. Given the cleaners were like 300$ for a small apartment, but my deposit was definitely more than that with California rent.</Text>

I have lived in a mangold apartment property for over 10 years and  have attended me very well. They were able to extend my rent payments and were able to provide a lot of help during the COVID-19 pandemic. During all of my years of living on the property, I have never had people assist me as helpful as Jackson Trapin and Jacqueline. You guys are the best.< /review>

I have been Mangold PM for a variety of property management and maintenance issues for almost two years now.  I find them to be an extremely prompt, courteous, and cost effective solution for me being a property owner a state away from his rental units.  Their range of expertise and services make them my one-stop-shop for my property management needs.<//text>

This is just a note of thanks for all the hard work and endless effort you demonstrated in this transition for us to get what I called "The house of my dreams." I have had my eyes on this property for a few years now and finally thanks to you and your hard work it is now a reality. It means a lot to me that I will soon live in peace with my wife and enjoy each day from this point on. Also I would like to thank you for your pleasant attitude when answering my many questions and your patience of my many phone calls, including your co-workers Alex and Francisco, your manager should be very, very proud of your dedication and service you provide on a daily basis<//review>

The people at Mangold Property Management really are unsung heroes in many respects. I want to thank them for their quick response on the recent plumbing issues in my property.  They have been great to both me and the tenant’s.  By the way, the landscaping and the rental lot look really good. Thanks to your staff!< /Review>

Mangold has been great to rent from.  From the first day we had a nice gal help us fill out the application form, and the day we moved in everything went smoothly.  I am really impressed with the response times of the tech crews whenever there is something that needs to be done.  All in all, solid company and solid business.< /text>

First, our family wishes yours a very Merry Christmas and wonderful remainder of the holiday season.  We’ve been very lucky to live in the Monterey area for the past 18 months, and having direct contact with you when issues arose at the house sets you apart from your contemporaries (and competitors).  Our sincerest thanks for everything!<//text>

I've been a tenant for over 3 years now, and have never had any problems with my apartment. I'm lucky enough to live in a building in a quiet neighborhood, and none of my neighbors have ever been a problem. There have been occasional maintenance issues - a burst pipe or inconsistent heat - but the Mangold PM facilities crew always fixes the problems in no time at all.   I do wish the apartment complex were entirely non-smoking, although I don’t expect that it will be.  And I do love the ivy and replanting that’s been going on, it is a great improvement.<//text>

The water at their residences  will often pour out a disgusting brown or rustic yellow. They do not operate speedily and obviously do not care about their Tennants< /text>

<response>{'time': 1532984406020, 'text': 'Hi Andy,\nI am concerned about the review you have left.  You mentioned our residences have water that is often brown or yellow.  I have not heard of this at any residences.  Sometimes the water company will do work to the main water supplies in areas and get debris in the lines and it can discolor the water.  If I can get the address I will be able to determine if this is the case.\nPlease call me to discuss.  (831) 372-1338.\nSincerely,\nCraig Coming\nPresident'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x808de426a5ffa8c9:0xc959d0545e8911f3<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've lived in my apartment for more than 5 years. I don't want to move to another area because it's always clean, silent, and the managers are very responsible. I'm very satisfied.< /review>

Even when I had a gentlemen here to inspect the unit before I moved in and specifically pointed out the items to his face there was no concern to call the maintenence department to have this resolved for me. I just can't see a 4 or 5 star rating when there is no concern or care involved, but don't worry the rent is always paid on time!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>Worst experience I have ever had with any property mangament company!!!! From the rental property to the customer service this business is by far the worst business.

I have only been in this rental property house for 6 days and I have numerous incidents and issues already.

This high end rental house ($4400 per month) was advertised as "move in ready" which clearly was not move in ready. The day I moved in I found out the refrigerator was broken and a new one was to be delivered the next day. I drove 4 hours to get here and I had groceries that needed to be refrigerated. I ended up throwing 3 large bags of food away. The communication was very poor from Mangold Property Management. If they knew the refrigerator was broken the day before I came they could have called/emailed me and informed me that a the refrigerator was broken, a new one was coming in a couple of days and not to pack any perishable items for there is no place to store them. I could have given my 3 bags of food away rather than packing it and letting it spoil.

Besides the broken refrigerator there was no microwave in the kitchen. 6 days ago when I signed my lease I was told a microwave should be coming but they had no clue when it is suppose to get here. 6 days later and still no word on the microwave.

Dennis the owner of Mangold Property also told me that the place would have a full clean from top to bottom before we moved in. That was not the case. In the master bathroom, old urine was clearly visible around the bottom base of the toilet. The carpets were so old and the smell was so bad it made me nauseous. We called Mangold Property and they sent someone to wash the carpet which was nice, but this should have been taken care of before we moved in.

The bedrooms are all upstairs and the 2 bedrooms where my kids sleep are connected to an outdoor balcony. The balcony doors in both bedrooms do not lock which seem like a serious safety issue. My kids are 3 and 5 and I do not want them having free access to a 2nd story balcony. I temporarily solved this issue by placing both of their dressers in front of the balcony door preventing the door from swinging open.

There were also these old armoires that are broken, wobbly, and tilting heavily to one side that could have been a disaster if it fell. They weren't attached to the wall and the most of the pieces were all broken. The have removed one of them to the garage and their still is one more upstairs that needs to be removed.

The oven had a broken knob so we could not turn the oven on. STEVE from the Mangold Property was sent to my rental to do an initial inspection today. He figured that we would not use the griddle as often so he removed that knob and placed it where the broken oven knob was. The knobs have different numbers on them so that quick fix did not work. It actually just filled the house with gas. I mentioned to him that the whole house smelled like gas now and he replied, "I don't smell anything". I complained as well as my 5 year old that we smelled gas around the whole house. I opened all the windows and told him he needs to call a professional to take a look at the oven. Steve was very RUDE and argumentative. It seemed like he became more frustrated as we pointed out everything that we found was an issue in the house. He left 1/2 way through the inspection and SLAMMED the front door! Steve is the most unprofessional employee I have ever met. Clearly I was also upset because of the gas situation in the house so he said I'll come back another time. I told Steve that I do not want him ever returning to my house and to send some one else over to do the initial inspection. Now I need to clear my schedule out again to meet another employee from the company when ALL of this should have been done before we moved in.

There are rat droppings everywhere in this house now! I need to get out of here. This is DISGUSTING!</review></record>

Awful company, please beware when renting with this company, they rent their properties to individuals that don't know their rights and exploit them, they charge 25 per applicant for credit check , but they never check your credit and keep your money major scam, they ask you to move out for no reason at all just to raise the rent, they charged double security deposit (2200) and when they call us to go pick up return deposit they only gave us $200 back, the apartment was left in immaculate condition and they made false claims to cheat you out of your money, 100 to removed satellite dish we never had satellite dish beware of this fraudulent company<//Review>

<Text>I went in for a keratin smoothing treatment and came out worse than I went in! Stylist was speechless and had nothing to say after. I told her how horrible it looked. I asked if it was supposed to look like this.. she said my hair was thin and that will be $225. I messaged the owner who responded promptly. I explained my results and she  did everything she could to get me in to have another stylist try again. I was hesitant but This stylist was professional, skilled, and definitely redeemed themselves in my eyes. Thank you for caring enough to try and fix it.< /Text>< GmapID>

I have curly hair and it is always a struggle to find someone who knows how to really cut curly hair. I was excited when I saw my stylist had curly hair. But that was where the excitement ended. I gave the stylist a run down of what I was looking for. No triangle head, face framing layers, and need to put up in a ponytail. Three weeks later I am still in tears as I am trying to style my own hair. I have short triangle hair that I can’t even put up with bobby-pins. Such a waste of time and money. Never again!< /text>< pics>

<Text>Tonight I went in to the salon with bright orange roots and brassy tips from a blonde balayage gone wrong at a different salon. I left feeling insanely happy & optimistic for the final result. The color specialist corrected my color and made the tone cool and silver in 1 session. Next week I come back for the final session in my quest to achieve a silver balayage & I know these ladies will have me taken care of! Great customer service & the stylist was so gentle with my scalp. So happy to find this place!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<rate>5</rate><review>From the moment I stepped into the salon, my experience was nothing short of amazing! I was offered something to drink, friendly staff escorted me to sit down and wait for my stylist. I didn’t have to wait long at all.
Lindsay was friendly, pleasant and professional. I asked her to do inverted bob haircut and previously I went to 3 different stylist with no successful result. So I was a little skeptical that it won’t work again. Lindsay listened to me, reviewed photos from Pinterest that I showed her, consulted with me about what I want and gave me good suggestion also. I received relaxing head massage before wash. As for haircut I was so extremely surprised how well it turned out and she styled it nicely too. I didn’t feel rushed or ignored the whole time I was there. I absolutely love Lindsay’s work, such a talented and wonderful stylist. I am planning to use her for color in the future as well. Couldn’t be happier in finding her. Thank you Lindsay!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I had a haircut with Yvonne this week and she did a wonderful job! I have straight hair on top and super curly hair underneath and I finally found a stylist that understood how to cut my crazy textured hair. I am headed out of town for a wedding this month and can't  wait to show off my new style. I am so happy I found Willo and Yvonne.<//Review><user_name>Cassandra Ramsey<//user_name>< Resp>

She is a sweet girl and It started off great. I enjoyed the hair washing, but when I explained the desired haircut (a short A line) it took 3 times to get even close to the way i explained it. Im not upset or anything, Its just much longer than what I had asked for. My hair grows really fast so I'll be needing another cut too soon. She seemed apprehensive to cut it shorter...Just a note on that, but otherwise, It was a great hair cut. I would still recommend this place. 😊</review>

<review>Krissy did a great job! made me feel very comfortable , they offered me a beverage when I walked in and when I sat down. Very professional,  my first hair cut was 10 or 20% off , and when you book a second appointment it's also 10% off. Also she styled my hair before I left at no charge made me feel wonderful walking out with brand new hair cut, and styled!! Love love the Willo!<//review>< Pictures>

I never go to the salon! Like never!
I wanted to do a little something for myself and my husband was like yes you should. I wasn’t even sure what I wanted done with my hair and when I walk into the salon I was greeted by the young lady at the front and I explained the problems I have in the he winter time with my scalp being very dry and irritated. She went and got Marcos and had him talk to me about what could be done to help. I got a moisturizing scalp treatment and he showed me some products that I could use daily to help with the dry scalp. I really don’t fit in at a salon like other women but it was nice to have someone take the time and explain what I needed and give me advice about my hair. I really appreciate it. Yes I would recommend this salon and his service!</review>

<text>Very disappointed in my second experience here with a stylist named ‘Cathy’.   All it takes is one bad experience to lose all faith in a place.
The stylist had a picture in front of her of the color I wanted.  After 2.5 hours she unveiled a totally different look from the one I was after and clearly shown in the picture.   I expressed that I was not happy and she said she could fix it.  2 hours later she unveiled an even worse orange tinged color.   During the process she promised to make things right.  I heard some discussion with her coworker about being careful not to make my hair orange.  Well guess what orange tones and hair line was the result.
At the cashier, almost in tears they asked for $170.   This was also not what I was quoted by the stylist, Cathy.
I paid and left extremely distressed.  It pays to get a good colorist...shop around.  Unfortunately I did not have a good experience.
I do want to add however that my first experience having my hair cut by  Marcus’ was a good one.
With this said I can’t return there, after such a poor customer service after they messed up my hair.

Amber does my hair and truly is amazing! I originally went to her with hair that had been destroyed by box color. My hair was in her hands. She did an amazing job getting RED out of my hair. I am still going to her a year later. And still love what she does with my hair. The Aveda products are amazing and there is nothing in comparison. Love the products, love the quality, love Amber. Great place! In all honesty, Wilo is expensive, there is no other way to put it. But you get what you pay for and I am very happy with what I get for the money.<//text>

My first loyalty is to the Aveda product, second to a superb hair stylist, Eric.  Love the Fair Oaks location. It's a comfortable place and pleasant experience.  Love the way they all help each other.  I'm a regular and I hope to stay so for a long time.<//review>

Erik Hyler is terrific. So professional, and I feel pampered when he does my Keratin treatments. I always leave my appointment with styling and care tips, as well.<//Review>

<Text>Jenni was recommended to me by a perfect stranger who had a beautiful hair cut:color. So I took a chance! Jenni was amazing. Listened to me, understood my concerns and made decisions according to my needs. I walked out with my difficult grays covered with a soft brown all over cover interrupted with light highlights. I haven’t loved my hair in a long time. Super cute fun short hair cut with feminine lines. Thank you.<//Text><resp>None</resp>< user>

Had a hair cut and color by Krissy Ballard. She did a beautiful job giving me an A line bob. My hair is straight so cuts need to be precise. It’s definitely one of her specialty cuts. Super cute and professional! Will be going back to her in the future. Highly recommend her!<//text>

This place is so amazing..everyone and the environment is very relaxing and positive. Rachel is amazing. I get compliments on my hair, all the time.
I have naturally curly hair and Rachel does too, so she understands the issues. She cut my hair so I can style it either curly or straight. Great place.< /Review>

Rachel has been my stylist  for about a year and she always makes the color very natural and shiny . She is an expert colorist and haircuts are amazing . Add to that a hand massage that almost puts  you to sleep , truly a great hair experience every time that transforms my day !< /Text>

My daughter recently got a haircut here with Mariah as her stylist. The haircut turned out exactly how we all liked. This was only her second haircut as her first one at a different salon did not go so well, Mariah was so patient with her wiggles, caring, understanding. Would definitely recommend, and will be returning.</text>

I LOVE this place and have been going to Lindsay since I was in high school (won’t say how long that is 😉). She takes her time to listen to what I want and it is always perfection! The staff is always super friendly when you walk in and always offers you a drink. Won’t go anywhere else!<//Text>

Rachel did an amazing job on my hair. The only issue I had is that I was quoted 80.00 dollars and at check out it was 120.00. I questioned the price and they dropped it down to 100.00. Said the toner was 20.00. I even filled out and signed paperwork that stated I was to pay 80.00. If it was more I felt as though I should have been informed.  Rachel did a good job on my hair. I do love the colo . .. Bonnie Sue Carter< /Review>

I love having Lindsay cut my hair. She ALWAYS listens to what my concerns are and fixes the problem if I have one. She is a very bright and bubbly person and is always willing to work with me if I can't come for an appointment she always finds room for me.<//review>

I love all 3 of the Willo locations, and have had fabulous experiences at each one. Yesterday, I treated myself to a blowout with James at the Fair Oaks location. He’s new to Willo, but not new to hair! I felt so pampered and left feeling like a better version of myself, and having made a new friend :)< /Review>

Jenni G
Is a wonderful, talented stylist with excellent knowledge of cutting and color skills. She manages to be able to communicate with her clients and deliver exactly what I want.  She also is able to offer suggestions of techniques for styling which are appreciated.
I am thrilled to have her as my beautician!<//review>

<text>I went or a haircut after 2 years, and this experience reaffirms why I haven’t gone back. The hair cut was fine, and Lindsay wad great! My review is for their charges. I paid $91 for a haircut that I pay $45 at the other Aveda salon I have been going for 7 years! After I paid for my my $80 haircut and  tip amount that they offer when you are paying, I left feeling mislead. They gave me a menu of their charges after I paid, showing that they had various  levels of haircuts! Apparently I had paid for a master level haircut employee! Really??!!!!!< /text>< pictures>

Only adding starts because AVEDA backs their stylists and will correct problems after services.  I was quoted a certain amount for a cut and color but paid over $100 more without being informed that the services would be additional AND still needed to get it corrected by a stylist at the Roseville location.  I suggest scheduling with Seth at the Roseville location if you want anything done with color, he is amazing and listened to exactly what I wanted.<//review>

Krissy was awesome and I made a follow up appt. however, I was pretty unhappy with the color turn out of my hair. I went in blonde and left a brunette. It was my first time there and from previous experience I know that it can be difficult to match colors from another salon. I plan to return to get my spring highlights in 4 weeks and will be hopeful to get my warm blonde hair back 😊.<//review>

Willo is exemplary with techniques, comfort and thoughtful applications far above other salons. Kathy who is a goldstar stylist with them is absolutely amazing in  her knowledge and sensitivity to the clients needs and preferences. I have been to salons in Beverly Hills, Granite Bay and Willo  is by far comprable if not more so in their trade. They are worth every bit of your time and money to invest  for your styling preferences. I would highly recommend the salon to anyone , but keep Kathy as a secret.<//review>

I had been to several hair stylist in the past year and a half trying to find someone who could cut my hair in an A-Line style like I wanted. But I was disappointed each time until I made my first appointment with Willo. Jenny listened to what I wanted & I couldn't be happier with my hair cut & style. Her friendly personality & massaging techniques are just added bonuses!!!!< /Text>

Walk in appointment are available but they made me make an appointment for later that day. I was like “okay thats fine, i’ll make the appointment for 2:00 pm”. I get there and they tell me “we don't have time for you, there’s another appointment coming in soon”. What do you mean you don’t have time for me? If you made make an appointment then you obviously had time for me. I wanted to get my hair dyed, but the stylist there only offered to dye my roots. I told her thats not what i wanted, that i made the appointment for the purpose of dying all my hair, she said she’d go get someone else to explain it to me because I “obviously didn't understand what she was saying”. I waited for 15 minutes before she came back with someone. They kept telling me that they'd only do my roots and wouldn't listen why I repeatedly told them i made the appointment for the full hair dye. They called me abusive for trying to explain why i was there and that “if i didn't like their service that i could leave”. Who the hell do they think they are to talk to a customer this way? Obviously i did leave because they were so disrespectful and wasteful of my damn time.< /Review>

Love this place! My go to to always kick back and relax and feel beautiful every time I leave. Marisa has been my stylist for 5-6 years, and she knows exactly what I like and don’t like, but is never afraid of spicing things up a bit if I ever want to. I love when we do a natural look, or for fun add in some different colors like pink, red, purple, etc. She does amazing with my extensions both tape in, and beaded. She’s a magician who conquers all that she does, and at the same time a loving and caring individual that thrives to make every client feel loved and accepted. I appreciate my stylist and salon for always being there!</review>

I'm a hair stylist myself and I've taken the summer off. I needed my niece's hair done so I called willo and took a chance. Rachel was absolutely the bomb. My niece's highlights turned out beautiful... definitely book with her...<//Text>

Erik Hyler is a gem and a half. I have moved to Arizona but still come to California so he can do my hair. Everything he touches turns to gold, he really listens and understands how to create a look that will be aesthetically pleasing while still fitting in with your lifestyle (any other folks who don't even own a hairvrush out there? No? Just me?). And he is just a joy to be around. So sweet, so fun. Erik has my business!</Text>

<review>I goofed & showed up the wrong Willo salon. The receptionist looked to see if the stylist I like had openings later in the day-& he did! Very accomodating. Their online appt system could use help (the appt I made did not register & required a few texts back & forth to confirm the appt I tried to make.)<//review>< rating>

<Review>I have been coming here since the previous location in Gold River. I love the Ávida products and will not use anything else when it comes to hair color. about a year ago my hair stylist moved out of the área, I was recommended to Erik, I took up the recommendation. I continue to see Erik today, he loves to cut and color my hair and I love how it always turns out.<//Review>< response>

He got my color and cut to the T! He has over 30 yrs experience, beyond knowledgeable and understands what you want ..and delivers! I have been back a 2nd time and I didn't think he could do it again, but he did! My hair is curly and difficult yet James is just a master of what he does and it shows! On a second note, you cant go wrong with any stylist at Willo!< /Review><name>Erika Speisser<//name></record>

Erik was wonderful, very knowledgeable and took time to talk with me and explained everything he was doing.   I only wish I could have had two hours instead on one.  I had a grown out pixie.  Erik trimmed up the back giving the the back a slight stack look.   Didn’t do much trimming on top or sides, (allow more time for the shorter pices to catch up with longer pieces.  ).    He blowed out my hair and helped me to see how I can do the same.   I probably will continue to wear my hair bands.  Lol,  overall the experience was very pleasant.  Head message I hope will continue.  I plan to come back!</text>

My go to for the last 9 years.

If your going here for the first time ask for Erik.

He's a pro and is occasionally humourous.

He's is also technically a hair stylist.

Win. Win.</Review>

<review>I cannot say enough awesome stuff about Shayn and the whole Willo team at their Fair Oaks salon. Shayn is extremely versatile and always up for the new challenge I bring her every time I visit. I tend to want something new every time and she knows exactly how to get it done. I love the collaboration that goes on between the stylist to make sure the best approach is being taken for my hair. It's like having my own team of stylists. I've gone from black to blonde and back with many colors in between and my hair still feels full and healthy.

I've found a lot of the AVEDA products to do wonders on my hair and they all smell incredible. Shayn never makes me feel pressured to buy something for the sake of a sale. Instead she identifies a need I may have, explains and demonstrates what they have and why I could benefit from it and I make my own informed decision. I haven't been disappointment in a single product because I end up getting what's right for me and my hair.

Last thing I want to add is that Willo, from my observations and personal experience, is both queer and transgender friendly. Everyone will feel welcome here. Prices are reasonable, as well. Definitely a 5-start experience.</review><UserId.>100234136598205139553</UserId.><user_name>Bailey Hollander</user_name></record>

I am always happy with my hair after Stephanie cuts,colors and styles it. I often get compliments from complete strangers on my hair. This seldom happened before I started going to Stephanie. The salon is very nicely set up and everyone is professional and friendly. It is worth the long drive that I make for my appointments!<//Review>

<Review>Amber is amazing. I came in to the fair oaks location desperately needing my hair fixed. I made a big mistake coloring my blonde hair a dark dark auburnish color and then attempted to fix it myself which just left my hair very damaged and still a dark red color and a bunch of different shades all over  it was a mess I was worried nobody would be willing to even try anything because of the shape my hair was in already. Amber really did an amazing job the fact that she really understood what my problem was and what I wanted to achieve. The outcome was so much more than I was expecting to be possible.im so happy with  The color and the feel of my hair  I'm very grateful and lucky that I had amber. She's amazing!!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>My story is too upsetting to repeat. I am just wasting my time with this place again because i need to let people know that they lack respect and customer service. I can't even put in words my disappointment and how humiliated I was. Stay away. Go spend your money somewhere else. There are great places with respectful, caring and very professional people.< /Review>< username>

<review>Ladies...Do not fall into this trap! This store uses great products. They have a decent set up...but, their business practices are unethical. Ask for an itemized receipt. You'll talk about services during your consultation. You'll agree to them. Yet, somehow they never happen. They remember to charge for them though. Stephanie was careless with my hair. She treated me poorly and took advantage of my generosity, flexibility, and willingness to overlook mistakes. In hindsight, I should have stopped going to her much sooner. This is not the first time I have been overcharged at an Aveda Salon. It also happened at the Loeman's Plaza location. The owner does not care. Her salons and their practices reflect her character. If you go here... just beware!</review>< Pics>

<review>I have had my hair done by Aveda salons exclusively for years, but this was my first visit to the Willo in Fair Oaks. I was there while they were moving, so the mess was understandable. What I don't understand is how they mismatched my Aveda color so terribly that I looked like a skunk one week later. At the price I paid, I supposedly had an expert.  I would drive the extra 15 minutes and go to the Willo in Sacramento, I will never be back.< /review>< Rating>

<text>Worst service I have gotten in my life. The lady's have the worst customer service. It took them 30 mins just to do my eyebrows and it was dead. Then they end up messing my eyebrows. I have no shape because she took so much hair out of one. I wanted to cry leaving this place. Don't come save yourself the trouble.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80d95239ef4bcfc9:0x52d9d52b426be0f9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<response>None< /response><review>Worst worst worst experience I ever had. Rude workers and terrible work on my nails and to top it of it was for my baby shower. Got a full set French tip done my nails look horrible some of my nails look thin and crock it. Also got a pedi and I didn’t want the back massage and the lady turned it on and I told her no I didn’t want it and she didn’t listen to me and still turned it back on.  I wouldn’t recommend this place ever to anyone. I will never return back there again.<//review>< user>

I'm sorry but this place is the best. Prices and employees are Awesome. I've been going there for years and will continue until I croak. I've went all around San Diego trying to find someone comparable and it was a colossal waste of time. My girl Lisa is the best. Just Saying, and for artificial nails I heard the men are on point.< /Text>

<text>I don't even think they deserve ONE star. I went in to get my eyebrows done and the lady looked me in the eye & didn't even speak to me! So I waited kindly and there was a lady ahead of me who got her hair cut bc it's a nail and hair salon. So these other ladies who had just finished with their nails decided to get their eyebrows done ..the lady looked at me and went to the ladies who had just got done and said she would take them I let her know I was next and she refused to service me so I left! RUDE !!! Bad customer service !!! DO NOT HO HERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>My mom has been taking me here since i was little. now i take myself, and still get great service at a GREAT price. I've gotten mani's and pedi's a couple times but being a guy, i wouldn't be an informed judge on it. They do great haircuts, i'm always happy with my hair when i leave, and quite some time after. Jenny is the stylist i use, and she is very friendly and can always give me the cut i'm asking for. I would say the only flaw i can see, it's very hard to understand them sometimes. (not racist, i swear) I'll be giving them my service for the foreseeable future.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>We had lunch here during a trip to Stinson beach, and the food quality was very good. Due to the covid restrictions, they are obviously hamstrung in terms of seating and service, but they make efforts to make the customers feel welcome in spite of that. Definitely worth checking out when in the vicinity.<//text>< pics>

<text>We were pleasantly surprised to find this place open when we headed into Stinson Beach looking for the bookstore. The sandwich board stating “adult slushies” 😋😎 drew us in, and we stayed for the food.

The oysters were great, and the beef ribs were incredibly tender! A big plus for one of our party, who needed easy-to-chew foods YAY. The slushies were amazing, BTW - rum plus a whole mess of other ingredients that we don’t remember, but made for a yummy blend.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtd04BCMLBKBpDZdz0U-BodPpccV16PyeXkA71=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCSasSgMYiwIu1ZqPc25j0UP2WK4ZWZPXwG82Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808593cdf61f89a5:0xb0ecce353b049062<//gmapID></record>

Californians will give just about anything that even remotely resembles food 5 stars. That’s very unfortunate because it becomes difficult to go online and tell if a place is any good. No matter how basic or overpriced a place might be, it’ll have at least 4 stars, so I’ve learned to treat the decimal as the actual rating. This place has 4.2 stars as of this post. So really it’s about 2 stars.<//Text>

Great, quick service on a very busy day. Lots of seating options outside, pet friendly and delicious tacos. Portion size was surprisingly big and I found the price very reasonable. Perfect for pre or post beach bites!</Text>

Food was good, although somewhat pricy for what we got. Did not like the bloody mary, but the margarita was yummy. Oysters were 6 for $18, so about normal. Got oysters, swordfish tacos and shrimp ceviche with 2 drinks for around $89 for lunch.<//Review>

Walk up to the counter and order your food and drink, then sit and relax outside or inside.  Small town feel, just off the beach on the main drag.  I didn't see many choices for food in Stinson Beach...< /text>

Great eatery with outdoor dining patio. Pet friendly too. We had lunch on a weekday during spring break and it wasn't crowded. Food was above average. Good cheeseburger and calamari. Fish taco was overcooked almost burnt. Nice place close to Stinson Beach. I would come here again.<//Review>

<Review>Menu selections are limited. Ordered the corned beef hash. This is my benchmark for any breakfast place. The way it's prepared tells me a lot about a place. The dish was mainly bell peppers and onions, fillers. Much room for improvement. They do serve a mean bloody Mary though.</Review>< Pics>

Amazing eggs Benedict. Bloody Mary was perfect and the staff is top notch. They also have great coffee. The prices are fair about $14  for and $3 for coffee. Much better quality and value than the Sand Dollar across the street. Breakers is wonderful.<//text>

Breakers Cafe is a great stop for lunch or breakfast! Great atmosphere and amazing service! I've been several times after spending the day on the beach and absolutely love it every time. You cannot go wrong with anything on their menu. I highly recommend making this a stop if you're near Stinson Beach.</Review>

<Text>The food is horrible.  We had breakfast there, from the ketchup to the potatoes and my poached eggs, everything tasted like it was dowsed in vinegar.

I ordered poached eggs well done and they were runny.  My toast was over cooked, hard and dry.  The bacon was under-cooked.  On top of that the potatoes were also greasy. Atmosphere is nice, bartender was great and hard working. I would only recommend this place for drinks, but I would never eat there again.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808593cdf61f89a5:0xb0ecce353b049062<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

For how much the food cost you'd at least think the fries would be fresh made and not the frozen bag stuff like at Walmart or something, very bland lackluster fries. Crab Melt was good. My wife got the seafood soup it was like 22 or 24$ and it gave her food poisoning. Turned our relaxing beach getaway into a scene from the exorcist, she is currently in a lot of pain. Sadly threw up all of her expensive soup since it wasn't cooked properly I'm guessing or maybe old seafood was used. Not worth the 50+$ we ended up spending. Didn't expect such a bad experience with so many good reviews. Extremely disappointed.< /text>

<Text>Spent $90 for food poisoning. Had their fried calamari and I’m sure that was it. People camp at tables forcing new customers to sit outside when it’s cold. Only 2 of the outdoor heaters had propane. Eventually came inside and bused our own table. Would not recommend.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Cute little restaurant with a good amount of outdoor and indoor seating.  Fire pit outside for the chilly days.  Order at the counter and take your number to your table to get served.  I got the garden salad, new England clam chowder and a beer.  The $13 soup was expensive but good and huge portion.  Dog friendly.  Chill atmosphere.  We went here before our reserved parking time at the Muir woods.  Would recommend!< /text>

We went on a Saturday brunch time. A number of groups ordered the oysters and alcoholic drinks. We didn't try it, but it seemed like the thing here. What was really annoying was all the bird poop outside--on our table and landing left and right as we were walking around the tables. I'd eat inside.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Date>

Lots of options, ranging from the healthy to the very unhealthy / most delicious.  Breakfasts are around $15 each.  Great way to start the day near Stinson Beach, highly recommend.< /Review>< pictures>

Stopped here for lunch and was not overly pleased. Ordered the Cod fish tacos, which were on the fishy side, and too large for any normal human to get in their mouth. Can't say much for cleanliness either. Nice setting though in a cute town. Next time I'll stick to ordering a beer at the bar.< /text>

Food was good and the restraunt was clean. Our drinks were not what we ordered and they forgot the waters. We had to go get our own butter and jelly for the toast. I asked twice for sweetner for my tea and had to go get that for myself as well. We probabley wont go back. The prices were high and the service did not match that.</review>

Food was ok, service was great. Outdoor seating available with only half offering shade. Keep in mind, there were only two restaurants available to choose from, they looked very similar. Flip a coin, have a bite before or after your beach outing<//Text>

<Text>Ate here about 20 times for great good with the smell of sea salt air. First time with dog outside. Never again. Ignored, cold eggs uncooked, cold still uncooked hashbrowns, pancakes with no syrup, toast unbuttered after our meal was delivered 15 later. Complained to host, Steve, twice. He comp'd our pancake. Saw our waitress only when we gave our order and when the bill came. It wasn't that busy, seen it much crazier. I think we're officially taken a break from Breakers.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x808593cdf61f89a5:0xb0ecce353b049062< /GmapID></record>

<Review>If there was a.way to give zero stars - I'd be giving it here...
All I ordered was coffee and creme brulee.  Coffee was ok but the creme brulee was really old and crumbly. The worst part was that the plate of the creme brulee was dirty with avocado... probably from a previous dish. When I mentioned it to the waitress she saw it and said " wow...gross
...."  And walked away.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808593cdf61f89a5:0xb0ecce353b049062< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Good food, self service, good coffee. Would have given 5 stars if the coffee were served in glass rather than paper cups. I had a latte which was good, but can't say excellent.
Had the huevos rancheros which were good..I personally prefer more chili.<//review>

<Review>The whole town of Stinson was a sight worth seeing, due to its location on the cliffs on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

Not a lot of places to choose from at Stinson Beach, which is nice, because they're all great.  Breakers has great coffee, they're open early and there's no shame in an 8:00 am bloody mary.  I can't wait to return.<//text>

<Text>Visited at an offpeak time (one person in line in front of us) and ordered for lunch. Had to wait nearly 30 mins for our food to come out. I surely hope that isn't normal!

Came with a group of friends and had the lobster bisque.

Tasted like watery lobster flavored tomato juice with cilantro.

Seriously. How do you screw up lobster bisque so bad?< /text>

Nice place, came here after a horrible experience at Parkside Cafe. Ordered the Steamed Mussels with Chorizo on special...wow, amazing. Really satisfied. Fast service, great food, free WiFi. No attitude like their neighbor Parkside Cafe.</Review>

You don’t have a lot of choices at Stinson Beach, but I think Parkside cafe is a better way to spend your money.  The food at Breakers was uninspiring and the cappuccino took almost no preparation time and tasty like drip coffee with some frothed milk on top.  Maybe Breakers has other redeeming qualities, but I don’t know what they are.</Review>

Someone please tell the chef of this place, the definition of what a PANINNI is. On the Menu it says "Tomato/Avocado" Paninni...when I ordered it...it was a sandwich of 2 breads toasted in a toaster. REALLY!!! and they charged me $9 for THAT??? My Husband ordered Quesadilla and it was tortilla filled with stuff but not cooked ...PATHETIC. not only it is pathetic ...it is an overpriced restaurant. Save yourself time and money and try some other restaurant.</review>

<text>I had the avacado shrimp omelet- it was great and unique (I added a little tobasco to spice it up) My wife had a scramble with avacado, tomato and toast- she also liked her food. Atmosphere was quaint and prices were reasonable for a small resort town.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I was alone once and ate very well. I would return without hesitation. Very good food, good dishes, attention was very good and the place is nice with an eclectic style that pleases. Highly recommended if you are in the area.

I highly recommend extra space. I grew up in Atwater, so I’m aware of the neighborhood, but the facility itself is safe and clean. I had a great experience with the staff at extra space, especially with JJ. He went above and beyond to make sure my needs were met.

Thanks again for all your help!</text>

When it became clear that there were no matching units available in my timeframe he checked around and referred me to their Alhambra site where I found just what I needed.  JJ went above and beyond.

I have used the services at this location twice and they have been efficient and their one-month free deal was legit. Although I stayed over for a week, they only billed me for the additional time and I did not have to sign a long contract to get the complimentary one month free.

JJ is an exceptional associate. I stopped by this evening to ensure my unit was in good shape and to purchase a lock ahead of my move in the morning and we discovered that somehow my unit was rented.  He was quick to sort out details to locate another available unit and ensured that all the proper paperwork and approvals were made this evening so that the new unit would be available for me in the morning upon arrival.  Previous to this visit, he was the associate I initially met with to acquaint me with the property and walk me through the process. He's always very polite, professional, calm and cool and exudes passion for his job with the excellen customer service he delivers. Thank you JJ for ensuring that my belongings are in good hands.<//review>

This Extra Space Storage is incredibly accommodating, and the folks who work there are all extremely friendly and helpful, JJ particularly. The space is easily accessible and clean. They also have some of the best deals and rates I've found. I would highly recommend them for any storage needs.</review>

<Review>Really greet place. Beth, was the manger in attendance. Despite the recent quarantine she found a way to let me see some units and get the paperwork  for me to rent a storage unit din 10 minutes.
They have great  prices,  longer hours and cleaner facilities  than the completion. The  fact that the employees are actually accountable and helpful , weighing all that in I highly recommend Extra Space storage.< /Review><response>{'time': 1589650523187, 'text': "Howard, thank you for the 5-star review!

<date>1603398428452</date><Text>The owners of this place hit the jackpot the day they hired JJ. This guy went way out of his way to make sure I was taken care of during the process of renting a unit. While in the process of reserving online I called with a question, that's when JJ answered. With his kind and genuine energy he helped me with my question. After getting off the phone my reservation dissapeared from my browser (guess I waited to long). I went back on the website only to find the unit was no longer available. Now get this, a few minutes later I received a call from JJ asking me if everything with my reservation was ok and if he could be of any help. I explained the problem. He was quick to solve it. He sent me my rental agreement. Then I had trouble signing it (I need a new browser). Low and behold I get a call, it's JJ! He helped me by verbally going over the contract and finishing up the process. I arrived around 7pm to find my unit with a lock and key waiting for me. I can't emphasize enough how happy I am with my unit and the service I received. I haven't met you face to face yet JJ -thank you for your time and help!!</Text>< GmapID>

<rating>5</rating><review>This is a review of the manager for this storage space, JJ. All the five stars are for him. I cannot speak to the price of the units and such, but I will say JJ is seriously one of the nicest and responsive managers for most anything - let alone storage units which often - sadly - are very poorly managed. I was moving a client out of this unit. She is very specific and wanted me to double - then triple - up to sextuple checking that she wouldn’t be charged and wanted repetitive inquiries. JJ was so kind and completely understanding and patient - and definitely had the clients interest in mind. JJ is a rare and special manager that respects and cares - and is extremely responsive - and for that alone - five stars for this location. But, again, really all the stars for JJ.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I had a very good experience with this location, in fact I have been looking at storage locations for a few days now because I needed to relocate from my previous storage location and when I stopped by the other and met JJ he was friendly and showed me the unit.
When I stopped by the following day and met Beth, she was also very friendly, walked me through to the entire process to rent my unit, went over everything in details.
Overall friendly personnel and very good experience.
Would recommend this place.</Text>

Steven was incredibly warm and professional. We had issues with our previous unit at a different facility and he made me feel very comfortable about the security of our stored items. We especially enjoyed the cart ride.</Review>

Extra Space Storage was amazing! JJ has such great energy, full of smiles and was extremely accommodating and considerate. I got this huge storage for an amazing price. It fit all of my stuff and the place was very clean. They have a newly remodeled bathroom in their office area and all of their staff was friendly. I saw him near my storage space and he even checked me out when he got back to the office which helped me out a ton before work! Thank you Extra Space Storage!< /Text>

Today I had to rent a smaller unit from the bigger one I have been renting here, Ken was very helpful in finding one that was close to the unit & accessible. The set up was quick and painless!<//review>

We rented a space for two year and our overall experience was excellent.
The Facility is clean and the Customer Service was superb.

It was great working with Ken. He is both accommodating and reliable.
In particular with ensuring our Fedex & UPS deliveries were placed in our unit.

Knowing your belongings are in good hands is very comforting.

Thanks for everything. It was great doing business with you.< /Text>

This Extra Space Storage in Atwater Village is awesome!! First of all, the location is great for a business that's running events all around Los Angeles--really central and easy to access of the freeways. Plus, the facility is really spacious, beautiful, and just well-kept overall. Most importantly, Ken and Jeremy are wonderful WONDERFUL people who really go above and beyond to make our rentals here smooth and easy. I ask a ton of questions and have many specific requests, and they have really taken the time to explain everything to me and work with me on what can be done. The service is really top-notch, and after days of searching for a decent storage unit (don't even bother with Public Storage--what a bunch of unhelpful goons who are only interested in completing a transaction), I am so glad I went the extra step and found an exceptional storage facility with Extra Space here.

Thank you, Ken! Thank you, Jeremy! ^.^<//Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Was great experience. JJ was very helpful. Was a little worried about the safety area as started getting closer to the lot, but it’s completely fenced in, very clean and professional. Got a good deal with web promotion, JJ showed me the space first and around the place. Then signup took five minutes. If you’re looking for storage and there’s an open spot here, definitely recommend.</Review>< user_id>

Great services.  The hours your unit is available is awesome.  Ken was always helpful when needed it.  He helped to get everything set up when I moved and when I was set to leave he was very helpful in making sure things went smoothly.<//Review>

<review>I have rented storage units from multiple vendors all over the country, and this is my favorite location to deal with. All of the staff are extremely friendly, professional and knowledgeable. The manager, Kenneth is very helpful and a great guy to deal with. The other office staff are also awesome, including Jackie, Warren and Liz. This location is always clean and organized. The office staff even helps me whenever I need a hand to send or receive a package, which is great for my business. I definitely recommend this location.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I have been renting a unit here for just a couple of months, and am already so pleased with both the facility and the staff support. The manager, Kenneth Johnson was especially helpful in dealing with a recent delivery of a valuable piece of furniture that had traveled cross-country in a huge truck (18 wheeler). He worked with the driver to park where the rig would not be blocking other customers, and he also helped me deal with the logistical challenges of getting everything where it belonged.<//Review>< user>

I've rented storage from four different companies, about 9-10 times and Extra Space Storage has been my favorite. Kenneth Johnson was immediately helpful and simple cool from the very first day I walked in till the last day that I checked out. I loved the location (very private). I would definitely recommend Extra Space Storage to anyone looking for storage space. That facility and spaces are clean. Easy to access and open late. This was a five star experience for me and Johnson is more than competent he's a genuine man,<//text>

<Text>Everyone I dealt with online was very friendly, accommodating and informative.  These folks are not "corporate" but real people aimed at helping you.  I just rented a space at Casitas Ave in LA, Ken was absolutely super.  Feel more than comfortable storing my possessions at the space--very safe--and feel I just joined a community called Extra Space Storage.

<review>I was originally supposed to meet with Beth but couldn’t make it before closing. The following day I met with JJ. He was the most wonderful man with excellent customer service. I’ve rented many storage units in the past and never had anyone come close to the caliber of quality as JJ. He was extremely helpful, completely thorough and helped me choose the right storage size and price in my budget. He made this process a breeze for someone as indecisive as I usually am. I would highly recommend JJ to guide you in choosing the right storage for you, especially when you’re in a bind and stressed out of your mind!< /review></record>

<review>Extra Space on Casitas is the best - I’ve rented units here three separate times, and no one else in LA even comes close. The space is clean, well maintained, and immaculate. The customer service is second to none - Ken and JJ really go the extra mile to make sure that each customer is well taken care of.

Kenneth is the best! Renting here for the second time because the first experience was so positive. He's super helpful, great to chat with and not pushy or trying to over sell you on things you don't need. The facilities are clean and well looked after and the hours to get in and out are great.</review>

I spent about 2 hours with Steven, who helped me book 7 units across the country for business.  He was able to set me up perfectly hassle-free and courteous the entire time.  Steven was even able to service other customers while tending to my jobs.

The facility itself was very clean and protected by cameras and had gate code access.  I had a great experience from a professional and customer service standpoint.</review>

<text>Very accommodating on my last minute mad dash to grab a storage unit.  The process of choosing a unit online and having it set up and ready to move in was less than 2 hours including  the traffic on the way over.  But once you get here it's like an oasis.  Right next to the river and bike path do you can go on a nice meditative walk if you really need to over analyze your organization of your stuff.  Stephen helped me out and was very helpful and down to earth.  The price was also very reasonable.  Overall fantastic vibe and experience, couldn't recommend it more.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Rate>5<//Rate><GmapID>0x80c2c12b78d6b027:0xb7318acd878d178e</GmapID><Name>Mike Riccitelli</Name><UserId.>116631296292649109926</UserId.>< response>

Customer service was excellent - Kenneth greeted me, showed me the units I was thinking about, gave me all the info I needed to make a decision, and also helpful tips about pricing.  He was fantastic.  Just keep going past the odd overpass (even though it doesn't look like anything would be there).  The location itself is nice, clean and well-kept - and the prices are definitely fair (go online for internet rates).  I feel like my things are secure, and after reading reviews of some pretty sketchy sounding places, I definitely feel good about my choice.  Already recommended it to a friend.< /Review></record>

It's rare that you really like your storage space!  But Extra Space is a wonderful place.  Ruben, the Manager is really nice and professional.  We had a good price for our unit and I checked around!  If you sign up for the auto-payment you can get up to 2 months free!  Yes, I know no-one plans to be in storage for a year or more, but it happens and when it does Extra Space Storage is a good place to be.<//text>

I was looking for a storage facility close to my home to accommodate a very large household of furniture. Ken Johnson provided excellent service! Ken gave me a tour of the Extra Space Storage facility in his golf cart, showed me my storage unit, which is very large and clean, and walked me through all of the paperwork I needed to complete, including insurance options.

Ken was very pleasant, personable, and patient, and he ensures his facility is kept clean and well maintained.

I highly recommend this facility, especially under the careful management of Ken!< /Text>

<Review>Kenneth was helpful and informative in showing me the available units and explaining how everything works at the facility. If you’re lucky you’ll get to take a ride in his golf cart.
JJ is also always incredibly helpful.
Good vibes at Extra Space Storage.

*** Updating my review to note for long term renters. they’ve raised my rent 3 times since I moved in. including once during this global pandemic. it’s a great clean facility with good hours and helpful staff...  but be aware that your rates are not locked.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Unfortunately had to edit my first review which was excellent upon signing up. Just showed up to my space and theres no rolling cart anywhere in the building which i was promised when i signed up. In fact the only reason i took this space which is very far from where you can park is because i was enthusiastically told there will always be a rolling cart by the door.
Well, no rolling cart and Ken is the only one here so i'm now having to wait who knows how long until he can bring me the cart.
what a bummer...< /Review>

< Review>
This is a clean, well-managed place convenient to everything yet tucked away on a quiet out-of-the-way street. I felt reassured with my four wheeled family heirloom in storage there. Never had a problem with access, and the facility is extremely safe. Ken, the current manager, took a personal interest in my needs and security.

Extra Space offered the best rates initially - but the gradual increases really started to make this place unaffordable. Over three years the rent increased nearly 75% - while my salary increased by 0%. Had I not had other arrangements, I would have started to look for alternatives. That being said, this Extra Space is still a great place for short-term storage.< /Review>

UPDATE:  the service has always been excellent here, and the new manager is a lovely person and was super gracious in assisting the move out process!

The downside I experienced was that I moved in at $170 and after a year started increasing it roughly $10/month until it was $235. That kind of price jacking should be illegal for personal storage. That said it is a convenient location.

INITIAL REVIEW:
Check in, facility tour,  info -- the whole process -- wss quick and simple...AND the gentleman that helped me was very friendly. Positive experience all around!  Oh, and the facility snd unit is very clean and modern.</Text>

Stephen, the Assistant Manager at Extra Storage, goes above and beyond in order to accommodate his customers.

We stopped by in a panic tonight within 15 minutes of closing, and Stephen quickly found us a space within minutes. He is sincere, non pressuring, and makes the leasing process a breeze. We were moving into our unit within minutes.

I can't sing Stephen's praises enough. He was a life saver!<//Review>

Went there to check on the unit and was met by Mr Ken Johnson. We were surprised on how clean the property and it’s surrounding.  We didn’t even have to think twice and decided this is the place. Big thank you to Ken for getting us in and out within 30 minutes.<//Text>

Kenneth and Veronica have been so wonderful to work with. They provide excellent customer service! I recently experienced a very stressful move and some problems from my cross country driver, but on the day of it all, Extra Space Storage helped me out. They were there for me and I was so grateful! Also, the facility is so clean compared to other local storage companies. The prices can't be beat either. Don't shop around! If you want to do business with the BEST, then choose Extra Space Storage!<//review>

< Review>
UPDATE:  the service has always been excellent here, and the new manager is a lovely person and was super gracious in assisting the move out process!

The downside I experienced was that I moved in at $170 and after a year started increasing it roughly $10/month until it was $235. That kind of price jacking should be illegal for personal storage. That said it is a convenient location.

INITIAL REVIEW:
Check in, facility tour,  info -- the whole process -- wss quick and simple...AND the gentleman that helped me was very friendly. Positive experience all around!  Oh, and the facility snd unit is very clean and modern.</Review>

Friendly local management and superb facility with great opening hours. If you are staying for an extended period in any Extra Space storage location for over a year, make sure you lock in your rate before the 3rd billing cycle, or you will suddenly find that the price that you were offered on moving in has mysterious been hiked up. This is not the fault of the specific location, just the douchebaggery of the Extra Space Storage parent company< /review>

Been at this facility way longer than I originally anticipated, and I'm too embarrassed to say just how long I've actually been here, but let's just say I've been through many managers and two or three name changes.  The management now has given the place a facelift...new paint and redid the floors and everything looks nice and clean now.  The manager Ken is very friendly and accommodating.   I have two other storage's and I don't get this kind of service with Public Storage or Life Storage.  I highly recommend extra space storage on Casitas in Atwater.

Have a groovy day,

Dudes are pros and know how to handle your stress of moving all your crap or parking your car for a month or two or years in their storage spaces, and they made it a really easy, pleasant experience. Will update once I move out but I don't foresee any issues these guys are on top of their game.< /Text>

Perfect place to dump a body (joking!) But srly, it's quite calm and you hardly see anybody and if you do everyone is minding their own business which is always good, they also don't charge for the trolleys!< /review>

<Review>I originally had a 5 star review for this place, but then my unit got robbed, the cameras here are worthless and staff refused to review footage,  I asked if any other units got robbed and was told no, when the police came to fingerprint my unit, I learned that they were also fingerprinting another unit. Several units got hit, no cooperation.  Make sure you have insurance, luckily I did, there are tons of people in and out of here every day and your stuff is at risk.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1574378439117, 'text': 'Justin, we consider security our top priority and are very sorry to hear about your experience.

I originally had a 5 star review for this place, but then my unit got robbed, the cameras here are worthless and staff refused to review footage,  I asked if any other units got robbed and was told no, when the police came to fingerprint my unit, I learned that they were also fingerprinting another unit. Several units got hit, no cooperation.  Make sure you have insurance, luckily I did, there are tons of people in and out of here every day and your stuff is at risk.< /review>
