<Text>Another wonderful week in Laguna! Started off chilly and rainy, but by the end of the week the weather was beautiful. It's such a nice, relaxing, and friendly place - always a good time! :)</Text>< Date>

<Review>Perfect coast-front units for quick getaways just a couple hours drive out of LA, but a world away.  Quiet quaint environs of Laguna with beach, art studios, restaurants and even grocery store within walking distance.   Mid week is great but weekends are fine outside any major events.  There were four in our party and we were comfortable though there was only one "bedroom."</Review>< Resp>

Laguna Beach is one of my favorite places on earth. Laguna Surf is a perfect little timeshare on the south end of downtown.  Walking distance to everything and you cant beat the views.<//Text>

Perfect location! Few feet from the beach. Walking distance to shops and great restaurants. Although the private  beach entrance was closed ; we had easy beach access through the public beach walk away "Sleepy Hollow".
Confortable and fully equipped units.</Text>

< Review>
My family has owned a time share at Laguna Surf for over 30 years, we're original owners. It has been kept up and managed wonderfully over the years, and the current management staff is probably the best they've ever had. The rooms are very comfortable, and they all include fully functional kitchens, complete with pots, pans, plates, and cutlery. The units facing the ocean offer some of the best views in Laguna. Laguna Surf is also ideally located within walking distance from most of the best spots in town. We go every year and have no intentions of selling.< /Review>

< Review>
For an ocean front property the beds are smaller than a queen & the mattresses feel as if they were leftover from 1960 they are so worn, lumpy & have such poor support. And the sheets have been used so much they have nubs on them. I was & have been appalled by this over the 8 years I’ve been coming here w/ my boyfriend now husband who invested in this condo years before me. This time I was disgusted that one of the pillowcases smelled of BO but because we came after 5 pm no one is ever here to help w/ bedding. And since we had to commute back & forth based on our work schedules we kept coming after 5 & so never got to get a new pillowcase. We love Laguna & the locale is great & beach access is super but the beds & sheets are so old & used you would think you were in a 1 Star hotel. And this time I don’t think they cleaned all the bedding either since the BO smell on the pillow.<//Review>

The location is perfect, just a short walk away from the downtown part of Laguna. The rooms are a good size with two bathrooms a master bedroom and a pull out Murphy bed from the wall. You can comfortably sleep four people. There are a few flights of stairs that lead down to the beach, and there's a jacuzzi on the rooftop. Although, the jacuzzi is not always open so don't count on it.<//Text>

Excellent location, wonderful shopping and dining are right outside the door.  The day spa downstairs is no longer there. Every unit has a parking spot in the gated subterranean structure. Units are one bedroom with two baths (1 full and 1 3/4) there is a murphy bed in the main room. Sleeps four max.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I do not recommend this place. I went to the other one that the owner has but since I got a cockroach in my food, I stopped going. I thought this would be cleaner and gave it a try. But from now on with the virus and come to see how they do not wash their hands after receiving money. Once I saw a worker enter through the back door and he did not have a mouth cover, and when he entered to pay, he noticed that nothing was put to work. They are definitely not taking the necessary care to prevent a client from getting sick.

(Original)
No recomiendo este lugar. Yo iba al otro q tiene el dueño pero desde q me salió una cucaracha en la comida deje de ir. Pensé q este sería más limpio y lo intente. Pero de ahora con lo del virus e llegado a ver como no se lavan las manos después de recibir dinero. Una ves mire a un trabajador entrar por la puerta de atrás y no traía tapa bocas, y al entrar a pagar note q así como si nada se puso a trabajar. Definitivamente no están teniendo los cuidados necesarios para evitar q un cliente se enferme.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Their menu said $ 7 for Asada Fries, but they charged me $ 8.50. And, the lady said they went up to $ 8, but the employee said $ 8.50. ?? They charge what the menu says. I'm not going to come back. They lost a 4 year old client. They charged $ 8.50 for Asada Fries when the menu said $ 7. They've lost a customer of 4 years because I won't be going back.

The customer service was spot on, and they serviced my vehicle quickly and were responsive and attentive to my questions. There was a little flub up with my key but they fixed it by replacing my keys and giving me a loaner vehicle to drive in the meantime. They also had me back in my own car in a timely manner.

Andrew, Brian and Donovan are amazing! 10/10! I recently purchased a GMC Terrain through them. The first time I decided to look at the car Andrew was there he was super friendly and had an answer to every question we had. When I purchased my vehicle Brian helped me. He made the process very easy and was willing to help me out in every way possible while being patient. For the finance office Donovan was so upbeat and nice with good advice! Overall they were awesome! Thank you guys!</review>

<Text>Everyone was very pleasant/polite. Jacob took care of my oil change the same day I call to make an appointment. The driver took me home and within an hour, Jacob call stating my SUV oil change was complete. The driver picked me up within 10 min. The driver was a very nice man. My SUV had been washed and the tires had been rotated. Thank you Jacob and your whole crew. You made my day. Thanks again.</Text>< gmapID>

<Review>We were served by Andrew and overall very happy with his services. There was no pressure to buy contrary to what is typically expected of a car salesman and Andrew took the time to answer all of our questions ensuring that we're fully satisfied with our decision to purchase before moving to the paperwork portion. The price we paid was very fair and we were not bombared by any "fake fees" which I had experienced at other dealerships before in the past. We love our car (Enclave 2020) so far and looking forward to enjoy it for years to come.</Review>< Pics>

Have done business with Alfred Matthews Buick GMC for several years and I am very happy with their service.  We have purchased vehicles, ordered parts, have had our vehicles serviced and unfortunately had to also have them repair vehicles involving auto accidents and they are always very courteous and helpful.  They communicate really well and make sure their customer is satisfied.  Thank you!!<//review>

Took a long time to get the part I needed and they made me pay the marked up price of the part they bought after they quoted me the lower cost. Paid an extra $100 for the repair. I know it’s not Justin’s fault but just wish something could’ve been done about it. Other than the part taking long, Justin was great and kept me updated throughout the whole process.< /review>

<Review>Bought my truck here 10-10-2020 and still awaiting my plates for the vehicle. Dealership still hasn’t resolved my issue even after being informed on several occasions that they didn’t submit my paperwork to dmv.
03-09-21 update I’ll stick with responding here Juan as this seems to be the only response I’ve gotten from you guys on the situation in a timely manner. Just got back from Lodi dmv and they stated that you guys just submitted everything two weeks ago so I should be expecting my plates by the 23rd of this month. 5 months for plates is pretty inconvenient. An DMV set the blame on your laps for not submitting it in a timely fashion. Just wanted to come on this platform to let others know what they’re getting themselves into by being a customer of Alfred gmc. I hope that others will share there experiences, an Alfred gmc will do right by the next customer here on.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>My sales associate was great. Super calm and patient. He covered all subjects of the deal thoroughly, making sure to not give me any misinformation. The lack of inventory nation wide is making the truck market very volatile, but even though they had three trucks on the lot, they still worked with me. I appreciate the lower volume and more family atmosphere of AM GMC. Will definitely recommend!</Review><user_name>Victor Reyes</user_name>< gmap_id>

<user_id>110691374087071110639<//user_id><Review>I took a trip to this dealership to look at a car maybe test drive it and gather information for a car purchase,  just a feel out I would say, when taking the test drive the salesman asked me if I were a Costco member, I did say yes because I am familiar with the Costco auto program as I am doing my research, the salesman tell me I get a $1000 off because I am a member, which I am aware of, I inquired what was the Costco pricing because there is a program which gives Costco members their own pricing as well as the extra $1000, the salesman insisted there was no other pricing, the $1000 off is the Costco pricing, so the salesman goes to ask the GM I believe if there is a Costco price sheet, the GM informs me the vehicle I am looking at is not part of the Costco program. Like I said I am just doing my due diligence in my research but it’s very disheartening that car salesman are either uninformed with the car sales program and pricing or just out right dishonest with potential buyers. The GM tells me if I find a deal on this car run to it don’t walk. I know every business is trying to make a profit but if you want honest, informative car salesman, or looking for a good deal I would advise staying away from Alfred Matthew’s Buick gmc</Review><resp>{'time': 1601842754484, 'text': 'Hello Mr. Patterson,\nThank you for the review. We are a Costco dealer all year long. During the months of October, November, and December, Costco Auto Program teams up with GM and adds different perks to certain select models. Right now there is a $6,000 Rebate from the factory and $1,000 Costco rebate if you are a member prior to September 30th, 2020. Dealers who are signed up with the Costco Program have the availability to add additional discounts if they choose...(Costco Price Sheet)  Like most or all of the GM dealerships in our area right now, we have excluded the Sierra pickup and they are doing the factory rebate only do to the limited supply of trucks on the lots. Inventory has been very slim this year for all dealers. I spoke with the Manager on duty that you spoke with and he was simply mentioning that if you have found another dealer that has more of a discount to get it because of the limited inventory before someone else buys it. This has been the case so far all year long where customers come in, take a look at a vehicle, leave, come back a few days later after shopping around to only find out  two or three others of that same vehicle have been sold.  So the salesman was correct about no other additional discounts from Costco besides the $1,000 Costco Rebate. If you change your mind or if we can address any other concerns please feel free to give me call at the dealership. Thank you for your time Mr. Patterson.'}</resp>< Date>

We connected with Luis Cuellar, internet sales manager and set up a visit. My wife and I drove up from Fresno, met Luis and checked out the Canyon. We were interested. The price was $25995 not negotiable. I had a pre-approved loan from NuVision Credit Union for $16000 and would pay the balance with a cashiers check the next day. The sales manager rejected my offer and said I had to use their credit services then and there. When I told him this was unacceptable, he walked away without another word. My wife and I left dismayed and disappointed. Luis did his job well but the sales manager left us with a bad taste in our mouth.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1605554196132, 'text': 'Hello Dennis,\nMy apologies for your experience at our dealership.

< review>
So for reference, we are dealing with uncertain circumstances due to covid-19 which has thrown our entire world for a loop. I have been wanting a new car for a while and finally with my time off of work, have decided to research and purchase. I found my perfect car here at this dealership online. I contacted them and was quickly in correspondence and we set an appointment for the next day For 1 specific vehicle. My husband who already commuted two hours from work, picked me up and we drove an extra hour away (2hrs in total) from our home to look at purchasing the vehicle discussed. I was in correspondence with the sales rep the same day as the appointment regarding changing the time (by a few hours) due to my husband commute and work schedule. Unfortunately I was not told that the car was already sold THE NIGHT BEFORE. I’m sure it was busy, but I really would have appreciated a phone call letting me know that the car I was driving out for was no longer available. The staff was respectable and informative however, I made a trip and got my hopes up for nothing. I hope they put practices into place to avoid this in the future. I can respect a hustle, but when you waste my time, I’m not happy about it.  I have a few family members in the area looking to upgrade and if all went well, I would have sent them here. I really did have high hopes and left disappointed. I hope they step up their communication and hope they don’t let something like this stop them from motivated buyers in the future.<//review>

Had the unfortunate circumstances of having both of my family's cars needing to be serviced over the span of one month. Luckily the folks at Alfred Matthews are amazing and made the process as painless as possible. Both cars required extended time in the shop and they were more than willing to accommodate my family's needs during that time. They were upfront with the cost and when the repairs were completed there was no sticker shock. In fact it came in less than quoted. And now I have two cars that run like a million bucks! A huge thanks to Alfred Matthews for their help!</Text>

< Review>
Today was my first experience with Alfred Matthews Buick GMC, Cadillac. First of all, their service department was able to get me in today where other dealerships were telling me next week. I had a check engine light on and had failed my smog test.  Sergio and service team was able to change oil, rotate tires, diagnose 2 error codes and fix them for me in a relatively short time. One happy customer!! Thanks</Review>

Ronnie Tyson was my salesman.  He really went above and beyond for me.  I had a little trouble with financing because I was dealing with the lemon law.  He helped me find a car that was in my price range and satisfied the customer care team I was dealing with.  I originally was going to buy a Nissan, but he showed me the advantages of a Buick.  I LOVE my car and I totally appreciate Ronnie making me feel like my car purchase was the most special thing for him to do.  Thank you Ronnie.  I have the most beautiful car on the road!!</text>

Great customer service. I received text notifications every day while they had my car with updates. They went above and beyond. When I got my car back they had washed and vacuumed my car! They must have waxed it or something because my car looked brand new.. mind you the damage they were fixing was the front bumper. I would DEFINITELY recommend them after my experience!<//review>

<text>I am in the military and my wife and I are stationed out of state but this area is our home town so, my wife and I decided to buy a used car to get us around so we wouldn't bother any family members. my wife and I have 2 kids so we made sure we got a SUV. less then 10 days driving this car that was "inspected" by this dealer ship my check engine light came on. then the car just turned off on my wife in 2 separate occasions with the steering wheel locked up both times.  I called into the dealer ship and they said come bring it in. now I don't have any warranty on it since they strongly advised me that it was more then the car was worth. I spent just under 10k cash on this car. it lasted 10 days. I am out of state now because like I said I am in the military so I had to come back to work. my wife is still in Modesto so lets see what happens. I have the feeling that they will not take care of us but I may be wrong. I'll let you know what they tell us tomorrow "16JUL19"

16JUL19 update
My wife spoke to the dealers and they said they were going to fix the SUV free of charge. I guess they did take care of us. this will be day 2 that they have our SUV. The SUV is still with them due to the fact that they need to order a wheel for a flat that we had at no fault to them but they said they would fix it free of charge as well. I can't wait to see if they will be true to there word. if they are then I would definitely recommend they to my fellow Soldiers and friends/family. we should be getting our SUV back on 17JUL19. I will give an update on what happens then.

17JUL19 Update
so I called my wife and she informed me that the staff was rely nice to her. they explained to her what was wrong with SUV fixed the issue, no charge. my wife took it for a test drive and said she liked it. I was shocked how happy my wife when she called telling me how she was excited to get her car back. I would recommend this dealership it has good service and always took care of us 100% even when I had my doubts they would.<//text><Name>ALEXANDER VELAZQUEZ< /Name>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The last time I had my car serviced I wrote a review about waiting for over an hour for the prearranged shuttle service who obviously forgot me and then having to argue with the dealer’s operator to get threw to the service department.
Now let’s fast forward to this experience. - when I phoned in to make the appointment I spoke with Jason the service manager. Jason was very kind and was trying to make the past mistakes up to me. He assured me I would have my car delivered to my work when the service was complete.
When I dropped my car off to initiate the work I asked the service desk to confirm my drop auto delivery when completed. I was told “We don’t give anyone that service. Do you want a shuttle or not”. I tried to explain I had a terrible experience the time before. He was not going to budge on the vehicle drop off. I’m going to stop here and ask if you wouldn’t - at this point - pick up a phone and start asking questions about this customer’s situation?  When I left I asked the Buick service guy if I could get my car serviced at the Chevy dealer across the street. “You can but it’ll void your warranty”
Hmmm. My car is long since out of the warranty period. I have since found a couple of very reputable mechanic other friends who own Buick’s take their cars to.
Bye bye Buick - and Chevy. After buying 6 other Chevy/ Buick vehicles - this was the straw. I am no longer going to remain faithful to US Autos as those US manufacturers are not faithful to the US.

Salesperson Brandon was right on top of everything. I had asked him to find a specific new car for me and he would contact me everytime he found one. Unfortunately they were all sold before I had a chance to look at them. He just kept trying. They gave me a really good deal, both in my trade in and on the new car. It was very easy to work with Donovan the finance manager.</Text>

<Review>Terrible place. I tried to get the recall work done. Got like 10 letters from GM that the parts were there. So I made an appointment. I got there and they had terrible customer service, they had attitudes and acted like i was dumb for being there. They told me that they didn't have the parts and i would have to go back another time. They didn't even offer to make another appointment. Then i called about two months later and spoke to a nice lady. She made my appointment for 2:30 and said she would call before my appointment if they didn't have the parts in and I specifically asked her if they would be able to do everything the same day. She said they would inspect it and then if it needed the part they would replace it. . When I arrive at 2:00, they take my car and tell me that they don't know if they have the parts needed. And they he told me that they would be able to get it back to me the next day. I work at 430am to 1pm, and drive an hour home, so I cant leave my car overnight. The earliest i get home is 2:30, he said that his guys leave at 4:30 and there's no way. Now I'm sitting here waiting for them to call back so I can pick up my half fixed car. I have no idea when ill be able to get my gas leak fixed.<//Review></record>

I waited a few days before posting this review just to make sure I wasn't posing and out of anger. I took my car here for insurance repairs after 6 months my car still not repaired they tried to charge my insurance company more then necessary and held my car for hostage they did the same thing to More than one person I know . They appear to be money hungry And often shown signs of being vindictive. I would never go to this place nor would I ever suggest anyone else go to this place. There other Cadillac dealers that are way more helpful and honest and trustworthy. I had a similar experience with the same company several years ago the thought why not just give him another chance. Boy was I wrong I should have listened to my 1st mind and took my car to Stockton I would've been better off. If you are able choose another Cadillac dealer.< /Text>

<text>I would like to begin by telling you that my wife and I have been fortunate in that we have been able to purchase seven new cars from various dealerships in the valley over the last eighteen years. The dealerships were Tracy Honda, Mistlin Honda, Chase Chevrolet, Heritage Ford and now Alfred Matthews. The experience my wife and I had at Alfred Matthews was by far the best we have had at any dealership. Jordan our salesman knows the vehicles well and was able to show us all of the features and answer all of our questions without hesitation. Jordan is very professional, courteous and has great communication skills. My wife and I were surprised when Jordan told us that he has been a member of the Alfred Matthews team less than a year because he definitely performs his job at a high level. I would expect that level of service from a veteran who has been in that profession for many years and to have experienced that with him is truly and honor and privilege. My wife and I also met a few other members of the Alfred Matthews staff that included Adrian Perez, Eddie Mack, Donovan Hearron, and Paul Caron. These men are a great example of what excellent customer service is and should be in any business. Alfred Matthews possesses a strong leadership team that is committed to its customers and staff. I can say that because the experience my wife and I had at Alfred Matthews is second to none. There is no doubt in our minds as to where we will look first and who we will recommend to our friends and family when it comes to purchasing a vehicle in the future....Alfred Matthews of course!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Quick and efficient service.  My new truck had a sticking e-brake, it wasn't that big of a deal, so I kind of put it off.  Albert followed up appropriately, and wouldn't let me forget.  Brought it in for the repair and while it was there, they checked my oil life, and it was almost due for an oil change.  Even though the cost of the oil change was included in my warranty, he still called to get my approval before doing the work.

<Text>I was driving my 2016 Cadillac and suddenly got flashing service lights telling me there was a problem with my all wheel drive and rear axle systems. I called the service department and explained what happened. Jason told me to bring it in. I was close by so I did. They took my car in, without an appointment. It took about an hour, but they figured out what the problem was, fixed it, and it was covered under warranty, no charge. I couldn't ask for better service.< /Text><gmapID>0x8090512edd734be3:0x8d42b7db3463eabe< /gmapID><resp>{'time': 1590782394389, 'text': 'Thank you for your review!

<Text>Overall my past experiences have been favorable. However, I recently took my Cadillac CTS in for an oil change and while driving to work two days later, I noticed smoke coming from my exhaust and pulled over only to find I had no oil registering on my dipstick. I had to have the car towed (my expense), back to the dealership, where they admitted that the oil filter was not sealed and caused the oil to leak out of my engine. I was informed it caused no damage to my engine (I hope that's the case). I take my vehicle to the dealership because I believe that is the best place to care for my Cadillac and I am willing to pay the extra dealership costs so these things don't happen, and my vehicle gets the best care suited to my Cadillac needs. I was a bit frustrated that the dealership did not ask to have my towing reimbursed, not to mention the $1000.00 that their mistake caused me to lose in business income from having to miss a day's work.  On the positive, I highly recommend, should you go for service, ask for "Jason" he is the service manager and is very honest, and professional.  I do not hold Jason responsible for the service issue in the review!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

< review>
We wasted 130 on a diagnostic only to find out they wanted 600 dollars more to replace a plastic piece on my Buick. It took my husband 3 mins to replace and It didn’t even work. Not sure what they were planning on doing and why they didn’t list what was really wrong with the car. Now I can’t even take the car to get fix because they didn’t list what was wrong. I thought taking in to them I would at least know what was wrong with it. Can’t find an honest mechanic.<//review>

Went down to look at used gmc terrain vehicle for our daughter in law. We loved it and told salesman we would be back down when she got off work to sign paperwork or start paperwork now. He suggested we do it online and save time. We did what we could and called a few hours later to come get the car with our daughter in law. Well he sold it out from under us! No phone call ,no nothing. Typical car salesman. Stay away from this place.< /review>

I had high hopes for this place and I wanted to send my car somewhere I can get the most reasonable price to fix my car. Estimated price to fix my car was 700 for a part that is 67 at auto zone. Last time I will go there for service. Also it took me 3 mins to replace.<//review>

I took my Buick to get the steering wheel repaired.  I had taken the vehicle twice before for the same issue.  The told me it was no longer under warranty.  After a discussion of the previous work they agreed to fix it.  I picked up the vehicle to find damage to my front bumper.  They stated it was old damage.  I informed them that I hand wash the vehicle and know the vehicle.  This was not old damage!  They got upset and very defensive.  They are liars and I would recommend to everyone not to use this shop.<//text>

<review>I was having issues with my vehicle and was transferred several times. I ended up being transferred to a Brittany who was extremely rude and unkind. I would not recommend this place based on their customer service. Brittany did not seem interested in helping me or getting me to the right person. It sounded like I had interrupted her day by simply calling. It sounded like she was on her cell phone or something, I am not sure.<//review>< Rate>

Our 2010 Acadia had an issue with losing power when making left-hand turns. The issue was taken care of under warranty. The techs at Alfred Matthews quickly diagnosed the problem. After determining it would take longer than usual to obtain the parts for the repair, we were offered a loaner for the time that we would be without our Acadia.

The repairs were made and the car drives just as well as it did before we had the problem. I could not be more satisfied with our experience and we will definitely be back if we have further issues. Paula in the Service department was a pleasure to deal with.<//review>

< Review>
I have had had two experiences with Alfred Matthews service dept. and both have been solid. I have a 1997 Suburban 4wd with a 454/7.4l. These vehicles have a few things that need attention after 160K miles. A mechanic named Glen knew these older truck styles and all their idiosyncrasies, he took care of the proportion-valve/rear brake issues without the usual diagnosis of fixing everything but the problem like most places would do. He knew exactly what needed to be done and fixed it. Even on an aftermarket part, he was able to find a fin or a slot or some weird thing on a rotor that was causing an ongoing mystery pull to the left. He used the shop resources(lots of 100k machines the standard shop won't have) to remedy the problem and solved a world a headache. I notice some bad reviews here, and believe me I'm the first one to blast any shop that I feel was just experimenting with my money, but these guys did good by me so I'm guessing those may have come from a different era of personnel. I've been there twice and I'll go there next time I have any issues with my burb.<//Review>

Horrible! Sergio is a liar and a cheat! mechanics are unqualified, it took them 3 times to fix my fuel system!!! first time they did not replace all failed parts, second time they replaced bad part with another bad part!!! it too them over a month to fix my car!!! Worst part, Sergio was trying to sell me new key fob when i only needed yhe battery to be replaced! Sergio then said it took them a long time to open the car door, Yeah, they scratched driver side window in 2 places trying to "jimmy" in my car! Seriously???? Also they ripped my driver side leather seat getting in and out of car! I approached them nicely about issues snd they accused me of fabricating all this! my car is a corvette and they abused it! Do Not take your car to them, they SUCK! i wonder why i am not allowed to see them anymore???? horrible experience ........ 1 star because i had too in order to post!!!< /text>

Promises and actuality didn't quite line up. We bought a new Acadia and because it was a Sunday and the detail show was closed, we brought it back a few days later. My wife is a teacher and timing is a problem so they have her a loaner so she could drop her off and pick it up the next afternoon. They called to say hers was done and ready and when she got there several hours later, it hadn't been touched. She had to wait an hour to have it done.<//Text>

Worst dealership in the world. Customer service sucks and when I came back again and was told to leave and was kicked out because they were getting in our faces and told them to back the flip off then treated us to call the cops so we waited. Over all sales manager eddy is a lair.</Review>< rating>

Average amount of homeless and tweakers, a place where all of porterville goes walking, jogging or using the skate board park. Full of fixie(bike)groups of kids. Also the south side of the park gets gusts of sewage as the park surrounds a sewage treatment area.</text>

<Review>Veterans Park has come a long way in looks and necessities. The playground has covered shade. I love the Benches that have been donated. The benches are made of great quality and looks, especially with the Donors names on them!!! What a great idea of recognition. Being a Senior I appreciate lots of benches, they are vital being close to the gated play area for when I take the grandchildren to play. God bless each Of those DONORS<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

It's the best park to walk around and there are always friendly faces. The only thing is the walkway that runs along Morton needs to be tended to. Bushes, weeds, and tree's alike.< /Text>

Pokémon GO Review: This park is great for Pokémon GO players. It offers more than 10 pokestops, 3 gyms, two of which are side by side, one gym is an EX raid gym and this park is also a nest! Easy walking paths with pokestops along the sidewalk.<//Text>

If you want a simple park then it's a place to go. Small playground, birthday party to celebrate here. There's skatepark nearby. Or if you want to just chill then it is indeed your place.</review>

The lights and benches are a nice touch. It is only missing basketball courts. It could use more lights down Morton. Also, it could use a path toward the tables on the that side.< /Text>

Nice, shaded playground, pavilions, and lots of uneven grassy space. The Vietnam veteran's memorial is nice too.< /text>

< Review>
Clean, near food and shopping, playgeound is gated which is awesome! Kids love the big train 😊 shaded with plenty of trees. Also has benches and plenty of space to throw bbqs or parties. The skate park is right accross the parkinglot next to it and my older kids love that place so its a cool little spot to take the whole family.<//Review>

<Text>Very good food. The owners are Italian, so the food tastes about like it would if you made the trip to Rome. Service was friendly,  but unobtrusive. Nice restaurant in a quiet neighborhood not far from downtown.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-4fMyx9v8x6E4-jo0bZjQj5CWvbp68r5M1Z0f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

First trip to San Diego and we decided to try different ethnic foods. This was a hit all the way around! It is a small restaurant with a wonderful welcoming atmosphere. I recommend making reservations because it was packed when we were there. Wine is excellent. Can't say enough about the food. Everything was a hit for us. We ordered different dishes and sampled each others food. There wasn't anything that we didn't like and the desserts cannot be passed up!!</Text>

Our first time trying this please it was so delicious I even called them after we were done eating and told him how delicious their food was and this will be my favorite Italian restaurant to come when I come to San Diego even though there’s a lot of Italian restaurants in Little Italy this one is my number one the best<//text>

< Review>
Just completed a southern CA vacation with friends.  Liking good Italian food, our hotel recommended Mia Trattoria and it didn't disappoint!  The pride in  providing personal service as well as excellent food mirrors Italian experiences.  Of our different meals, all were excellent, as was the wine and apps.  We didn't have room for dessert but said we'd return which we did.  The next night, our last in San Diego, we enjoyed wonderful desserts and wine, capped with excellent lemonciello, hugs and kisses we exited with fond memories of our enjoyable time spent in San Diego.<//Review>

Neighborhood "go to" for top notch Italian with a welcoming staff...the owner remembers everyone..even where they prefer to sit/dine.  Melt in your mouth food awaits complements of chef "Sammy" (thanks for the vegan request). A wonderful experience EVERY time. Great for a cozy "date night" or solo dining at the Bar.  You will love this place...</Review>

This place is amazing! The food was delicious and simple. We shared the grilled veggies appetizer then had risotto and fried shrimp with calamari. Also tried their tiramisu. Everything including service was outstanding! The wine list is pretty diverse. There were Californian and Italian wines in it. The music was very "Italian" and added to the ambiance a lot. We enjoyed the whole experience. Will definitely go back and also will try their brunch menu!</Review>

So far so good. Desserts are great. Nice hide away away from the main drag and great people. The owner and manager and chef were so great. Open for 6 month so have to let people know about this place.</text>

Hey! Honestly one of the best authentic Italian places in San Diego! None of that tourist trap stuff with the food here, Italian owned and operated with the proper pride for good food and wine! This is the perfect place for an intimate dinner with family and loved ones of great food is appreciated. Definitely get the tiramisu because they are the best way to finish off the meal :)< /text>

The food was amazing and the staff was very respectable.  Hands down 5 stars.  After finishing every last mussel, clam, shrimp and noodle from my entree (fettuccine al frutti di mare) I honestly felt like a million bucks. Truly hit the spot. They were very generous with the amount of seafood they served with the fettuccine and the buttery garlic sauce was perfect. I would have took a picture but I was so hungry I wasn't about to wait. I chose this place based off of the pictures I already saw under photos for this restaurant. The pictures did not lie, it was as good as it looked! My girlfriend got the raviolli ricotta e spinaci and she had said it was so good she made me try it. And honestly I didnt feel like eating raviolli at the time, but after i took a bite I was blown away. It was by far the best raviolli I have ever had. It had the perfect amount of cheese, spinach, sage sauce and butter. Overall the meal was excellent and the staff was super helpful,  attentive, welcoming and respectful. I would absolutely come back! Had to leave a note on the receipt saying how much I enjoyed my meal.  Thanks again Mia Trattoria!</text>

Absolutely amazing food. It's a family owned restraunt with amazing service and stunning food. I had the ravioli and I wish I would have ordered about 5 more plates. The tiramisu was the best I've ever had. Absolutely phenomenal. If you want an amazing traditional italian restraunt this is it.< /text>

Had a very good meal and nice experience @Mia last night. Is a nice neighborhood trattoria with very friendly people that own and run it. The food was very good, the grilled octopus with asparagus sauce, the tonnarelli cacio e Pepe pasta dish was superb and then for main courses the lamb chops and the prime beef were also very good. The owner even gave us one of his homemade tiramisu at the end!

Nice little wine list, mostly lower cost bottles, had a nice mid price bottle of Italian red vino.

Will be adding Mia to the regular rotation.<//review>

Wonderful!

We started with an Insalata Mista, dressed with a nice perky balsamic vinaigrette. We had three pasta dishes and all were excellent: Rigatoni Amatriciana, Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe (the pasta is fresh not dried) and Spaghetti alla Carbonara. Dessert was also excellent: fresh Strawberry Gelato, Tiramisu and Cannoli Siciliani. We finished with Espresso and Cappuccino which both had incredible crema (foam).

There are so many delicious choices on their menu that I can hardly wait to return for another wonderful meal.< /Review>

<Review>We were visiting San Diego, began to search for a special place to dine. Our dining experience was Very Special.  Our Calamari and shrimp was exceptional, lightly breaded and fried to perfection. Our server was attentive to our wine and refills. We ordered Ravioli and the spagetti special was cooked perfectly. We finished with a delicious Tiramisu. The owner, Sergio was professional and hospitable. It was a perfect evening and highly recommend this gem as the perfect quaint date night.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80d954cf3af71857:0x846358c43c43f523</gmap_id></record>

<user_id>105410929363930057598<//user_id><Text>We went there for lunch today, it was our second time.  The first lunch was OK but nothing special and we love neighborhood restaurants so we decided to give it a second chance.  That was an bad and costly decision.  We ordered a caprese salad that arrives as 4 gigantic slabs of tomato with thin slices of mozzarella and some olive oil drizzled over.  No basil!  I asked for basil and the waiter had to go to the store next door and buy some - what Italian restaurant does not have fresh basil in the kitchen?? Our entrees arrived after a long interval.  I had ordered eggplant meatballs.  They turned out to be seven deep fried balls of something that tasted very much like falafel.  The sauce they were nestled in was too salty to be edible.  My husband ordered pasta with a light sauce that was just OK.  He also ordered iced tea and when he asked for a refill was charged for another iced tea.  So, we had an appetizer, two meatless entrees, two iced teas and our bill was $52.00  which I thought was outrageous for lunch.  We won't be giving it a third chance.</Text>< Name>

<review>Mia Trattoria is incredible!!! The food is amazing and the staff is wonderful. I made a 15 person reservation for my family in Christmas Eve and they spoiled us rotten!! Treated us like family and it was such an amazing and homey family dinner!
My family members still keep telling me how much fun they had and that it was their favorite christmas meal. Definitely check out this restaraunt and you'll want to become a regular. The most friendly staff! Owner Sergio is the best.
Dinner, dessert, wine, cappuccinos! All was incredible!!!</review><time>1515795281049<//time><GmapID>0x80d954cf3af71857:0x846358c43c43f523< /GmapID><Response>None<//Response>< name>

I just finished a really lovely dinner here on Christmas with my family. The service was friendly, attentive and personable, and our four year old was welcomed very generously. This is a family-owned authentic Italian dining experience. Excellent food, especially the zuppa di funghi and the panna cotta. Good value. 14/10 would recommend.</Review>

Everything was amazing, no complaints. The food was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Expect to pay a fair price for this service and excellent food (more expensive than your average dinner but definitely worth the money)</text>

<rating>3< /rating><review>Cindy's Donuts, they are as good as any other place open at 6 am. Fact being that for the better part most places are not open till late morning and some closer till noon. Donut shops on the other hand, most open closer to 4 am which is awesome. Best thing is you know the donuts taste the best early in the am because they were just made. Nothing like a fresh soft tasty wonder. Thanks Cindy's Donuts.
Your lemon filled and apple bear claws were amazing! Also covid compliant and not mean about it, thats always a plus.

Thank you for reading and have a swell day. Asta< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>We wanted a little more than the basic doughnut selection since our neighborhood doughnut shop is good but has just the basics. We checked out a few other options close by online and decided on Cindy’s. We are so glad we did, not only do they have a beautiful presentation but are equally as yummy. Made a special treat for our 7 year olds birthday and will most definitely return.< /text>< Pics>

This family apparently makes our family warm and happy every Saturday morning with fresh donuts. Raspberry and Bavarian cream are my two favorites. Support your small business. 5 stars. Very recommended< /Review>

Very delicious! Doughnuts are well made and of good quality. Croissants are also wonderfully flaky and slightly sweet! A good choice for a sweet breakfast. Festive and fun decorations!< /review>

The donuts had a fresh taste to them that I had not experienced in a while.
The Apple fritters were not over fried and hard as it n most places. The cinnamon roll was moist and fluffy.
The pastries were not over glazed. The blueberry doughnuts were tasty and the kids went crazy over the chocolate glazed ones.
It's a small place I discovered when visiting the pho place next door.
It's a bit pricier than most doughnut shops in the area, but worth it.
Don't wait too long, the close at 1.< /text>

<Response>None<//Response><text>An Amazing local donut and pastry shop. Awesome customers service.  The family that works there is extremely nice and respectful. Always great quality donuts. Always fresh. I love the selection and the location is prime. My only concern is the price. Though it's fair, I wish they were a lil cheaper and had more hours of operation. Hopefully this helps you.< /text><Name>Blake Winters<//Name><rate>5< /rate><pictures>None<//pictures>< GmapID>

Brandon was incredibly nice and upfront about what he was going to do! He even came and showed us the oil level on the dipstick without being asked to do so, and washed our windows! Very great service! There was a bit of a long wait time which is totally understandable because there were 6 people in front of us, 4 of which were getting breaks done.

Please keep up the good work!<//text>

Notice that my oil gauge was going crazy this morning on my bus, went to check it and realized that I had very low to no oil left. when I recently just took it to a different mechanic Simi Valley. I them contact Brandon from Jiffy lube took me right in, check everything and did a fantastic job! My bus is my lifeline and Brandon understood that. He went thru the whole thing with a fine tooth comb, and took great care of my baby! Thank you again Brandon your def a rock star ⭐!<//Text>

Sent my daughter to get simple oil change and tire rotation and they tried to sell her on transmission fluid change. I just fully flushed that transmission less than one year ago. They charged her over $100 for oil change. Rip off guys.< /text>

Based on their service quality, average wait times & speed, and their staff's attitude/friendliness, this Jiffy Lube is usually a great place to get an oil change, tire rotation, air filter replacement, etc. This place is right down the street from my house as well which makes it an easy option for me when I need an oil change.

That being said, today seemed to be an exception to my past experiences at the Jiffy Lube off New LA in Moorpark. I went by there today on a Sunday morning for a simple oil change and possibly to flush any fluids that were dirty, per their suggestion at my last visit. However, when I pulled up to the open service bay a the high school age service attendant noticed that my car was a stick-shift and said, "oh, we can't do manual transmissions today... come back tomorrow morning."  To which I replied, "HUH?? What do you mean?"

This poor kid had to then explain to me how none of the 4 people working that day (there may have been even more than that many people working, 4 was all I could see) knew how to drive stick so they were unable to drive my car up onto the service bay and that I wasn't allowed to do it myself.  As though it takes some kind of doctorate degree to drive forward slowly while following hand signals.

Anyways, since I work Monday - Fridays I was obviously unable to simply bring my car back in the morning so I had to drive all the way to the Jiffy Lube in Thousand Oaks. Well, I guess I didn't "have to" go to another Jiffy Lube, but I'm cheap and wanted to use my $20off coupon that as a loyal customer they send me when it's time for another oil change.

I guess I just think it's pretty riduculous that a business who works on cars wouldn't employ mechanics who know how to drive a manual transmission. Call me crazy.  Other than that they're usually pretty good. That’s the reason behind my 3 out of 5 stars.< /Text>

When of the better jiffy lubes always really nice and curtious. Also pricing is very competitive. The only reservation I have is they aren't very jiffy but at least they get the job done right.</Review>

<review>Great community park with old Bridge, mill house, fishing,  BBQ grills, tables and a couple of trails along the river.

The trails that follow the river require some boldering and may be too challenging for little kids or the elderly though< /review>< Pics>

<text>January, very chilly, bring a jacket!
Great place to visit, picnic tables, barbecues,  hiking, canoe,  and just a good leisure stroll.  Not all locations are for wheels but the majority is handicap accessible.
Day use only!  There are no parking lot lights or lights in the restrooms.  This is not a ‘free’ park, sad to say the ticket machine only takes plastic ( credit cards or debit cards 😢).  $5.00 per vehicle 👍.</text>< pictures>

Beautiful moderate to easy hike. Spring has lots of stunning wildflowers and this year the river is up and flowing rapidly. Lots of little trail offshoots to explore. Easy enough for kiddos. Lots of other people, but not overwhelming. Dog on leash friendly. Restaurant and cafe nearby outside of park if you want to get breakfast or lunch before or after your hike.<//Review>

Knights Ferry is gorgeous. Filled with amazing sites, and the wonderful outdoors. However, its pretty foggy and the clouds are filled with soot. Not the most attractive view of the sky.</review>

Beautiful landmark. We walked around here for a couple hours and had a picnic in a near by park. Also found a nice patch of grass to play some bocce ball that we brought. Good times and beautiful location.</Review>

<review>Great place for photos, hiking and catching frogs. Yes there are lots of frogs and tadpoles. Like tons.  One trail along the river even has bathrooms about a mile up.

Really beautiful place.</review>< pics>

One of the few destinations around, historic. Fairly cliche place for taking photos locally (expect to see many a photographer and many a engaged couple). Parking can be a pain. River access is nearby (but can be dangerous, heed warnings). Take the kids there frequently, nice place for easy hike.</review>

<text>One of the few places you can still find running water in California without a lot of hiking around. Trails are also not that difficult but air quality can be an issue if you suffer from allergies.</text>< pics>

The best place around Oakdale to go walk around and explore. Beautiful scenery and old civil war era architecture. Bring what you need with you though as there are a very limited amount of conveniences in the area aside from a couple restaurants and an old shop.< /Review>

This place is great to have a BBQ and go for a swim in the lake. It gets pretty busy so it's best to get there early.</Review>

Great place to hike and explore. If you don't cross the covered bridge from the old jail house side there is a trail you can hike. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery while you and the family get some experience. There is also a spot where you can cliff job. If you cross the covered bridge there is a trail as well, one that is not so family friendly that will take you all the way along to someone's property. You can cross the river from either side by jumping from rock to rock when the water level is low enough. I have done this multiple times with friends. It's a beautiful and great time. It's a must see if you are visiting or a local to the surrounding area.< /review>

< review>
I bought a car in November.. I didn't realize it was bad till I drove it off the lot a hr later  the tire sensor went on and the back drivers side brake light was out. I let them know and they told me they would fix it. I assumed they fixed it so i drove off.. I got pulled over for my light this time and got a ticket the same day they they supposed to fix it so I took it to the Kia dealer in Victorville. I left the car with them for 10 days to tell me the tire sensor went on because the tire wasn't the right size and the sensor was missing.. Then the radio had to be replaced all coils in the car were bad. Spark plugs were bad. Oil hasn't been changed because it was black. All this added up to $1,250 to get my car out of the dealer.. I definitely got ripped off because they made me sign a paper stating they looked at the car entirely when they obviously didn't.. I hope no one goes through what I did.<//review>

Bought a car from this place in January and my car has been in the shop since March with more work having to be done on it then the car is worth. I was sold a lemon and will never by another car from this place. Yes buying a car from this place may be easy and the salesman may seem nice and understanding but he his all about the sale and $$$. If you buy from this place RUN AND GO HAVE A MECHANIC REALLY CHECK IT OUT!!!! BUYERS BEWARE!!!!</Text>

<Text>Bought a car from this place and they didnt give me temporary paper plates which by law u must do in California. Ended up getting pulled over and now my license is on hold because i have a different address on my license then where i stay. Which isnt a big deal but now i have a traffic ticket that i have to pay for because these BOZOS dont know what they are doing. And they also said law states they dont have to give paper plates if the car already had plates, only thing is the plates on the car said “Victorville auto sales” . Such a joke.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c365c33d500001:0x2092661e0b1e57b2<//gmapID><Date>1598508349026<//Date></record></dataset><record>

I would have given one star but Ehab was super cool. I went and looked at a truck they have there. The truck in the pictures look flawless! It was super clean in the pictures. I do a walk around like any normal person would before they buy a used vehicle... now I get the truck is used, but after the walk around I found a bunch of dents, dings, scratches, and RUST! In the pictures, none of this was shown. The description on the ad of the truck said the truck was in flawless condition and there were no problems with it. I come to find out after an hour drive that the truck is terrible shape. The bed is rusted out, you can see daylight through the bed. There are dents and dings through the entire truck and scratches on every corner. We went for a test drive in the truck and it rode smooth other then about a 1/4 turn of play in the steering wheel while driving. If you’re looking to buy a car that you don’t care about and will be a beater then this is your place, but if you’re looking for a good quality vehicle. I would stay away from here. Ehab told me when I was looking at the truck that he wants to make sure his customers are taken care of and honesty is his first priority. Well if honesty is his first priority then he should have pictures of everything that is wrong with the truck and talk with the customer before they make a trip down to the lot. Part of it may be my fault and for not asking for pictures of any of the stuff that wasn’t shown but they should warn you about it before hand.

STAY CLEAR OF THIS PLACE. THEY ARE A BUNCH OF CAR-SALESMEN THAT JUST WANT YOUR MONEY.< /Text>

Had a very good experience with the sales manager with the purchase of my 2014 Honda accord, he worked with me to come up with a great agreement and the purchase was done. You should come down to Victorville auto sales and see what deal you can make.< /review>

I feel super young again and gained more confidence with the choices she made with how we should do my hair because to be honest I wasn’t really sure with what direction I was going with my hair.

During COVID, I grew my long gray hair out. It hadn't been cut for a year. I love Aveda salons. Fusion3 was perfect. I showed Tori what I wanted to go back to short hair.She did a great job. I will be back. Thank you Tori<//text>

<Review>Courtney is amazing! My hair had grown out for over a year and she did an amazing job freshening up my blonde and working on taking it back up. I love the techniques she used giving my hair much needed dimension. She was also very attentive to maintain the integrity of my hair. This was my first time at the salon and I'm more than impressed with the skill and added services. I was offered a hand massage, hot towel for my neck, cookies, water, tea I mean talk about a quality experience! I can't wait for my next visit in a couple months! Thanks again for an amazing first visit Fusion 3 Salon in Brentwood CA!</Review>< Pics>

<text>Love this salon, so sad to be moving out of state, I don't think I can ever replace them. They are all wonderful, but I usually saw Vanessa. She is a true artist, whose work always got me complements everywhere I went. In all of my years going to this location, I never had a single complaint with them.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1501634475096, 'text': "We're sad you're moving!

I've had some good hair colorings at Fusion 3 in Livermore, but I am not going back to any of these three salons. Half a year ago, I expressly asked for a new talent hair coloring and then added on a haircut that day. I wasn't warned that the woman cutting my hair was experienced talent, so I was surprised at the end by the bill. Yesterday at the Brentwood salon, I was going to be 15 minutes late to a hair appointment, and while I do not like lateness, this was still around rush hour, so I hoped they would be understanding. After just 10 minutes beyond my scheduled time, I got a call saying that my hair colorist was already starting on another client. So apparently, she only had allotted 10 minutes to sit me down, get me a cup of coffee, mix the color and apply the coloring to my hair????? Sounds unlikely. I was offered the choice of getting experienced talent & going home with wet hair or else rescheduling. I opted for switching to another salon. I cannot imagine that other clients are never 10-15 minutes late, but it seems Fusion 3 lacks flexibility to juggle their appointments.< /Review>

I had the most wonderful experience at this Salon! Iam so happy that Brentwood has an Aveda salon, the staff here is very warm and professional at the same time! I recieved a free hand massage while shampoo and it was such an unexpected perk! Overall they care for the customers! My color stylist was Tasha and I will be going back more often!! Love Fusion 3! keep it up.< /Text>

<text>My absolute favorite salon!  I've been going to Fusion 3 since it opened in Pleasanton.  I have since gone to the Livermore location and now Brentwood and each of them have been equally wonderful!  It's such a comforting feeling to walk in the doors of a new salon and know you'll come out with hair you'll love just as much as at any of the other locations.  Everyone is so talented and friendly, I wouldn't want to go anywhere else!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I had a great time, they were what seemed the only shop doing Friday the 13th tattoos in Santa Cruz this 2021. I was able to get on the wait-list just in time. Super happy with my artist and staff. I now want an old school tattoo added to my collection of body art because of all the beautiful work they had around the shop. Would definitely go back to possibly get that done by them!😆</review>

I had such an amazing experience today at this place! i walked right in and was helped so professionally and kindly. I was tattooed by Joseph and not only does he but all the other artists take their time to perfect customers tattoos. I was so pleased with how everything turned out and i couldn’t have gone to a better shop! such great quality work with awesome artists.</Review>

On a road trip running through Santa Cruz for a couple of days. Saw the reviews and walked in to see what they could offer. Their artist, Keeli, absolutely crushed my tattoo. The owner Joey knocked out an amazing tat for my girlfriend. Beyond the tats these guys treated us amazingly. Great conversation. Super professional. Really just made the whole experience killer. Can’t thank the guys enough for staying open later and just absolutely treating our tats like a priority. I will be rolling back through.<//text>

< Review>
Came in for a walk-in with a drawing of a taxidermy fish and Mars took on my little drawing, evened/cleaned it up, I was hella nervous because it was my first tattoo but Mars took my design and made it really something to marvel at. Overall just made it a really comfortable experience, it was so clean and he was super conscious/considerate of how I was doing with the pain for my first time and I got to leave with two pieces I am absolutely in love with. The line work is simply stunning and neat and I don’t think I’ll ever stop looking at my arm. I 10/10 recommend, absolutely coming back for more :’))<//Review>

<Text>I had an amazing experience at Paradise with Joey as my artist. He was very professional and patient, making sure I really loved the placement and size of the piece. He really focused on my comfort and continually checked in to make sure I was doing alright. The tattoo turned out perfect, and was centered exactly down my spine. Couldn’t recommend the shop enough, very clean and great music. All of the employees were very friendly and had a great energy. I was the last customer and the people closing made sure I got to my car safe since it was dark out.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fb72290866a81:0x5d524821271aa6e<//gmapID></record>

Recently got my first tattoo done by Eddie, and his patience and reassurance throughout the process made it extremely enjoyable. I am not only pleased with my first tattoo, but I came to get another large floral tattoo done by Joseph. Joseph walked me through the process, was extremely easy going, and kind, all while remaining very professional. Pricing is fair and all the artist are super sweet and make sure to prioritize and please every single one of their customers! I will be back for more!</Text>

<date>1626364102933</date><Text>Was in Santa Cruz for a couple days on vacation. Decided to get some tattoos to mark the occasion since the wife and I weren't sure when we could visit again. Eddie did a beautiful, somewhat intricate, little piece on my wife. Turned out great. Justin did a simple little piece on me, quite heavy handed and line work was a little off. But otherwise, not my worst tattoo experience. If I had more time (and quite a bit more cash) I'd be interested to see what some of the other artists can pull off. Next time I'm in town, would visit again: if they would have me in of course, 7/10.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808fb72290866a81:0x5d524821271aa6e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

HOLY HECK I had the most amazing experience here. Justin did the best job ever hooking us up with his spin on some American Traditional flash tattoos! Helped me pick the location, color, design, everything, and I'm smiling EAR TO EAR!!! A million thanks to Justin and the whole crew❤️</review>

We came in for an appointment for Joey and got in at a timely manner. The whole shop was very clean especially his station. I got my tattoo on my sternum (between the beasts) and he made sure I was very comfortable throughout the whole experience and even put up a privacy screen. He did an amazing job on both mine and my friend’s tattoo and I’ll definitely go back there!< /Review>

<Review>Eddie Chavez did an amazing job! 10/10 would recommend getting ink from him! He is so nice, gentle, and incredibly talented! If you are looking for a hyper realistic tattoo, go with Eddie!! His attention to detail is astonishing! Overall, Paradise Tattoo is very clean and has great energy! Will be returning and asking for Eddie:)!!</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaA7jv_X6kXF6cg_vg2u_-AUwuxDkjz2UHz7Ym=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808fb72290866a81:0x5d524821271aa6e</gmapID></record>

Spur of the moment a friend and I decided to make good on our matching tattoos. We found Paradise Tattoo and they were able to accommodate us as walk ins. The shop is immaculately clean, the artists are so friendly. Joseph James has such gentle hands and it was an amazing experience being tattooed by him. 10/10 recommend this shop. They are absolutely amazing!</Text>

I came in with several disjointed ideas, and he was very patient with me in parsing out what it was I actually wanted, answering all my questions in a chill, non-judgmental way. He was really easy to talk with, and made the actual tattoo process comfortable and enjoyable. I couldn't be happier with the result: the art is gorgeous, the lines are crisp, the saturation is unreal. Looking forward to next time!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>I got a tattoo at this shop today. I had tried to get one last night (as a walk in) but they were fully booked. Even so, they offered great customer service and  I was helped in booking an appointment for the next day (today) so ensure I got my tattoo. The tattoo itself is exactly what I wanted and I’m over the moon (pun intended) in love with it.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Just got a tattoo and I'm really greatful they were able to take my friends and me even after hours. The shop has such a chill vibe and everyone seemed really receptive to walk ins and questions. Mars did our tattoos and was really patient and thorough with all of us. Honestly the least painful tattoo I've ever had and it came out better than expected.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Came in to get a tattoo and Joey did a wonderful job sketching out a personalized design for me! The quality and time that was put into my tattoo made for one of my favorite tattoos that I have so far. He even gave me quarters for the meter outside! So nice! I also got a tattoo from eddie and his skills in detail and fine line are immaculate. Santo also helped me out at the front and while I was getting my tattoo I got a little chilly and he closed the door so I didn’t catch a draft! Everyone was so nice and those hard wood floors are truly breath taking. I will definitely be going back to Paradise to get more work done. Perfection.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fb72290866a81:0x5d524821271aa6e</gmapID></record>

Joseph took the time with me to find exactly what size I wanted my tattoo and made the whole process easy and exciting! My tattoos came out better than I ever imagined!

My daughter has been twice to Paradise Tattoo for 4 new tattoos. My dad passed away very suddenly on 12/28/20. Due to the pandemic, I had not seen him since January 2020. Myself & my family are heartbroken 💔

A few weeks after he passed my daughter made an appointment at Paradise. She came home & had gotten the word ‘sweet’ tattooed on the outside of her left forearm - near her wrist. Sweet was my dad’s last name - my maiden name. Joey had done the tattoo & it was very delicate. She mentioned that he had a light touch & was very friendly.

I didn’t have any tattoos but after seeing hers felt compelled to get one to honor my awesome dad. My daughter made an appointment for me today with Joey. I ended up with ‘Sweet’ on the inside of my left forearm near my wrist & another tattoo on my right arm in the same spot.

Joey was so nice. He explained the process throughly & asked me how I was doing while working on both tattoos. I had fun chatting with him (I am a talker!) and learning how he got into the tattoo business.

I would definitely recommend Paradise Tattoo. The establishment was clean, inviting, and the staff was very friendly!</Text>

Definitely a 5-star shop. Every last detail was thought out an executed well, from the neon signs out front to the interior flash racks and the team of awesome artists. Everyone I interacted with at the shop was friendly and the energy inside was positive and welcoming.  I was tattooed by Joey who was very patient with my perfectionism and just had a general good vibe which made it an overall incredible experience. Highly recommend checking them out, 10/10 all the way around.<//Text>

<Text>Eddie Chavez did an amazing job on my fine line tattoo. He was clean, professional and he did everything he could to make my experience at Paradise Tattoo comfortable. He paid close attention to detail and my tattoo came out looking perfect. I would highly recommend him to anyone in the Bay Area looking to get a fine line micro-realism tattoo!!!

Absolutely amazing shop and even more amazing artist! I had the opportunity to get tattooed by the owner Joseph James and he did an absolutely amazing job just as expected. Their Instagrams really showcases their skill which lead to badass tattoos. I am beyond satisfied with my tattoo, I love it and will definitely be coming back. :)</review>

We could not have asked for a better experience! From the moment we contacted the artist to the moment we left the shop, we felt comfortable, taken care of and at ease! They did everything possible to make getting the tattoo as easy as possible. The tattoo itself turned out better than we ever imagined! The owner Joey was so accommodating and knowledgeable, we will definately be back!<//Review>

I stopped in as a walk-in and they were very welcoming and had no problem taking me in as they were already super busy. Justin Gallagher was the artist that did an amazing job. Positive Vibes for sure, and happy clients were walking out the door.</Text>

Came in for a walk-in type of tattoo of a hummingbird and got exactly what i wanted. Mars was my artist and he was really accommodating, professional, and nice to talk to. Everyone in the shop had good vibes and everyone who came in seemed really comfortable. 10/10 will come back< /Review>

Eddie is a sweet dude who put a fine line dragon on my belly and a spiderweb on my leg - and I couldn't be happier with my decision to work with him.< /review>

It was a great experience! Mars was amazing! Super nice during the entire experience! I love the tattoo and it wasn’t painful at all! Comparable to angel kisses even! The machine he used was small and barely made any noises. He was very nice and made sure that I was okay throughout the process! Definitely recommend going to him for any tattoos! The entire shop was filled with nice people and made it feel very calming! 100/10 the best experience getting a tattoo! Mars did an amazing job and made it look even better than I could have hoped! He also has a very delicate hand so it was not painful and all of the details look amazing! Love this place! His Instagram is @cloudsolid definitely go to him!!< /Text>

<review>We cannot say enough!! We had a blast, and the artist and art work was amazing! We were from out of town, stayed in Santa Cruz celebrating a loved one who was supposed to had been in Puerto Rico on his 50th but ended up passing away sooner. We are grateful Paradise Tattoo SC allowed walk-ins for all 9 of us. My art work was done by Mars. He is awesome, made me feel comfortable, patient, professional and does incredible work.

Very nice big and new shop. Tall and open space with rad art. Joseph was super quick and my tattoo came out amazing! If you’re a fan of black and bold or traditional definitely hit him up! I’ll be coming back</text>

Got my first tattoo at Paradise. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Justin, my tattoo artist, made sure it was a pleasant experience. Highly recommended if you’re looking for a place that’s close to the city and does great work.<//review>

I was recommended to this shop by a friend. I’m very happy I went. The shop is spacious and clean and has a great location. Mars did a fantastic job with my tattoo. The line work he did was perfect - about as straight a line as you can get. They are taking customers during COVID, and I felt comfortable with the cleanliness of the shop. Thank you again!</Review>

Had the best experience with Keeli tattooer. He was amazing the whole time, gave me and my fiancé exactly what we wanted. My fiancé almost passed out and he was quick on helping him in anyway that was needed. Recommend to anyone that wants a tattoo. The best tattooing experience I’ve had yet.

<review>I got tattooed by Joey at paradise tattoo last night and let me tell you the whole experience was AMAZING!! From beginning to end my friends and I were treated so well. The tattoos came out exactly how we wanted and he really took the time to make sure it was perfect. Unlike other artists, Joey was easy to talk to and get comfortable around. Would 100% recommend anyone looking for a tattoo to come here! The atmosphere in the shop was very welcoming and clean. 10/10 would come again. Best tattoo experience so far!<//review>< Name>

The artist who did me and my fiancé’s Narwhal tattoo, Keeli, was an absolutely wonderful, outstanding man who not only provided us with quality tattoos but as I fainted afterwards he helped me and stabilized me from falling and gave me water. His skills with tattooing are wonderful, his line work isn’t heavy handed, nor light, but it’s just the perfect amount of weight. He was so professional with helping us and how he handled everything for us. When we come back from out of town we will definitely come get another tattoo from here. 10/10.< /Text><name>Eric Guzman</name>< Pictures>

Had such a great experience! I loved the plants and art displayed on the walls, it gave me something to focus on while getting the tattoo! The artists are extremely talented and professional. Cool music and really cool vibe, I’ll definitely be coming back!< /review>

Paradise Tattoo is a perfect place to come for an array of tattoo styles, I got two mirrored black jaguars on the front of my chest here in the American Traditional style and they are amazing! Joseph is a fantastic artist and I hope to get more work done here!<//text>

Mars (@cloudsolid) was super friendly and great artist! Highly recommend! I went for a Friday the 13th tattoo, and were good with having us wait and calling us when it was our turn. I got a scorpion tattoo with red ink, and was really happy how it turned out.< /text>

<review>I got my tattoo from Mars, or cloudsolid on Instagram, and it was all around perfect.
First of all, he is overall super nice and chill. He can draw anything you suggest and he will get it exactly how you imagine it. Then throughout the whole process he makes sure you’re comfortable, relaxed and able to keep going. During the tattoo you can just chat and have a nice convo, or if you need to relax he will just focus on the tattoo and not even mind, so he is great for all those introverted snd extroverted people. He is also very nice about working with your budget. You can tell him how much you have and he will completely work around that.
Secondly, just his tattoo machine is the best because it is so quite and feels super nice compared to other tattoo machines. For me it felt the same as someone drawing on my arm with a fine tip sharpie.
Third, the atmosphere is really nice. All the artists seem really nice and welcoming. The shop feels like a place of happy times with people being hyped about their new art or just hanging out with pals.
Overall this was by far the best experience I had getting a tattoo. The tattoo turned out absolutely amazing and I had so much fun getting it done.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I’m vegan and LOVE that they use all natural and vegan ink if requested. They’re a new shop and the experience was super positive. Joseph James spent a lot of time explaining the process and I appreciated that. He was also very considerate of the social distancing and taking the extra precautions during all this. Love my tattoo! Thank you!</review>

Came in for a walk in tattoo, had a brief consultation and came back a few hours later for a great tattoo with Justin. If I'm getting tattooed in Santa Cruz, it will always be at Paradise.< /Text>

Ray tattooed both my boyfriend and I. We picked both picked something off the wall, ray alternated them to our request and threw his own spin on them so we could have unique tattoos. AMAZING WORK! We were both blown away and said we were coming back.

I’ve also been tattooed by the owner Joesph and he does amazing work as well!! Can’t go wrong with a shop like this.

Thanks again!!< /text>

We crossed paths with Joseph about a year ago while we were in town, and since then have been back to see him two more times and will be back again in a few months for more! Paradise Tattoo is the cleanest and most organized shop I've seen. Both Joseph and Ray are not only extremely talented artists, but great people as well!! Their artistry, ideas and clean lines are the best I've come across. Paradise Tattoo will not disappoint! You'll walk out with rad ink, and a love for both the shop and the guys. Thanks Joey and Ray!! See you soon!< /Text>

I had my tattoo done by Joey and let me tell you, from beginning to end, best experience yet. My tattoo turned out exactly how I wanted it, other than that he was extremely considerate, helpful, and precise throughout everything. Definitely coming back for future tattoos!!</Text>

<text>Joseph was so accommodating and did an incredible job on a small minimal tattoo with fine lines. Made me feel comfortable, heard my ideas and was more than willing to change anything to my liking, an overall great experience for my first tattoo! Recommend to anyone near Santa Cruz or willing to make the drive for great customer service :)<//text><gmapID>0x808fb72290866a81:0x5d524821271aa6e</gmapID>< userid>

Love this place! Joseph is awesome and keeps the conversation going so if you’re nervous about gettint inked dont be. I got my sisters birthday in roman numerals and they definitely helped in sizing/placement and took the time to do whats best and what looked best on me too. Definitely recommend coming in.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>They got me in right way. I had a vision of what I wanted in my head and they made my vision come true. I only get tattoos that mean something special to me and he captured my vision perfectly.The tattoo artist who was also the owner was so nice and professional. He opened the niddle right in front of me and he cleaned everything off before he did anything. The place was very clean and the atmosphere was very peaceful. The tattoo started to hurt but he had something to help numb the area which helped tremendously. I would recommend this place to anyone of my friends and family. I will be going back the this place for all my future tattoo needs.</text>< Pictures>

I’ve been to this tattoo shop on two separate occasion. Both of the times I’ve been tattooed by the owner of the shop he’s done most of my finger tattoos such a good quality tattoos and was exactly what I wanted. I’m not from the area I’m from Bakersfield don’t mind coming out here to know I’m working with a chill cool laid back professional person. Would recommend this tattoo shop to anyone who’s in the area! Thank you ✌🏻< /Text>

I went in the other day to get my first professional tattoo ever, I was getting a cover up of some of my really bad home style tattoos. Joey was my artist and not only did he do an amazing job but he also helped me pick out a design I liked, personally added onto it because the original didnt have enough shading to be a cover up, and talked me through the whole thing and ended up making it an overall great experience for me. He also a super cool person to talk to and he has great music taste. I'm in love with my tattoo and I'm going back to Paradise Tattoo for more as soon as I can.</text>

<review>I never leave bad reviews because its waste of time, but I will make an exception for this place... got a really bad infection from this place. Spent over $700 getting better at urgent care. Artist was extremely rude/dismissive when I attempted to communicate with them. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, and will never come back here.

He's a great conversationalist, I hate when I'm getting a tattoo and the artist doesn't talk, doesn't make me feel comfortable, and just doesn't make an effort basically. He was busy all day and I didn't feel treated like just another number even tho my tattoo was a small one. He did beautifully and I definitely plan on coming back to him!!!

<text>I have to say, this shop will ALWAYS be my go to when I come into town. We live in Sacramento and wanted to get tattoos before we took our 3 hour drive home. Joseph was great he should’ve been closing shop but said if we didn’t mind waiting he’d get the next person done and shoot us a message. We went to the bar across the way. Btw great environment as well!!  Came back he was just finishing offered us to go next door and grab food. By sh*t it was DELICIOUS. Aye. And when I say I love ink I love ink I like when the artist can input ideas without shredding mine. And he was great. Both my girl and I got tattoos. And will return probably EVERY Santa Cruz visit LOL

Thanks again -Sacramento, Linnea</text>< UserId.>

<Review>Joseph James has tattooed me a couple times now and I've had nothing but great experiences. Hands down the best tattoo artist I've had and have ever seen. Really down to Earth and all around fantastic person to be tattooed by. Will definitely be going back to him again, no doubt about it.< /Review>< user_id>

Met James on a summer vacation to get a trinket tattoo with three of my friends. Walked into a clean, friendly, open shop with great service. Our tattoos were perfect and James even provided the best care for our friend who was getting her first tattoo. I would definitely visit again !< /Text>

My new and only tattoo shop I will ever visit!!! Where do I even begin!!! Okay so my girlfriend and I had appointments with another tattoo artist at a different shop and he totally blew us off 30 mins before our appointment. Luckily we walked in to Paradise Tattoo and Joey and Ray helped us right away.... they took our ideas drew them up in about an hour and a half and we came back and got tattooed.. we were there well after the shop closed until about 12:30am and it was so fun and amazing to see such professionalism from these guys!!! I’ve never experienced such good customer service like this in my life this is my new tattoo shop and these guys are the best and their work is amazing!!

To Joey and Ray:
Thank you guys so much!!! We will see you soon!!!

If you’re looking for an all around good time and great quality this is the place for you. I’ve gotten 3 tattoos from joseph and he’s gonna be my artist for the rest of my tattoos. Always quality, clean work and good vibes to go with it.< /Text>

Met Joseph James this summer for a small walk in tattoo! I’ll be back in about a month to do a bigger piece with him! So happy I met him and he shop is very clean ,sterile, and professional ! If your in Santa Cruz Joseph James is the tattoo artist to go to ! $100 minimum but it’s worth it to me . I could tell he took his time and made sure it was right and I was happy with everything . And I’ll take that over a cheap tattoo anyway ! Thxs Joey<//review>

Man! I am so glad I found Joseph in Santa Cruz for a tattoo! We were just looking to get a small walk in tattoo but we looked his Instagram up and I had no clue we were getting such a Great artist  ! Joseph is by far one of the best tattoo artist in Santa Cruz . I got a rose and panther tattoo all in traditional colors ! I’m so stoked on this ! It came out amazing and it was my first tattoo. Also I really like how he uses all vegan and natural products . Thxs again Joey ! Can’t wait for my second tattoo ! I’ll see you soon bud !<//review>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>From Los Angeles to the Santa Cruz waters! We found Jospeh James tattoo in Santa Cruz California . Really good dude to have do a solid tattoo . Myself and my buddy came in Monday morning and got matching tattoos ! Jospeh squeezed us in right before his appointment and we’re so excited with our new tattoos . Jospeh has really clean lines and it was honestly kinda painless . He did a great job and were both really happy with our tattoos< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmap_id>

This was my first time at Paradise tattoo and I had a great experience! My tattoo artist, Justin, was caring and patient. He gave me a lot of helpful advice about the placement and size of my tattoo. I would definitely come back here to get another tattoo!<//Review>

<Text>I had a great time, they were what seemed the only shop doing Friday the 13th tattoos in Santa Cruz this 2021. I was able to get on the wait-list just in time. Super happy with my artist and staff. I now want an old school tattoo added to my collection of body art because of all the beautiful work they had around the shop. Would definitely go back to possibly get that done by them!😆</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtW7SneA3YfIciUZFCse2gPtOr9R3dTEKCqroi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><user_name>Josy Feild< /user_name></record>

I had a really great experience getting tattooed here by Joey. He's done a really great job creating a relaxing environment, I was able to feel completely comfortable during the process. Also, I was not rushed or pressured with any alterations I requested. I love my tattoos and will definitely be back</Text>

<text>On a road trip running through Santa Cruz for a couple of days. Saw the reviews and walked in to see what they could offer. Their artist, Keeli, absolutely crushed my tattoo. The owner Joey knocked out an amazing tat for my girlfriend. Beyond the tats these guys treated us amazingly. Great conversation. Super professional. Really just made the whole experience killer. Can’t thank the guys enough for staying open later and just absolutely treating our tats like a priority. I will be rolling back through.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3sfeZuljZFknWz1r-rcf0sdQM77CKM-rjvXfq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3UcG0LA4Yvv5TE0q-EwdM2ms2EnXGyNCf9yBl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Came in for a walk-in with a drawing of a taxidermy fish and Mars took on my little drawing, evened/cleaned it up, I was hella nervous because it was my first tattoo but Mars took my design and made it really something to marvel at. Overall just made it a really comfortable experience, it was so clean and he was super conscious/considerate of how I was doing with the pain for my first time and I got to leave with two pieces I am absolutely in love with. The line work is simply stunning and neat and I don’t think I’ll ever stop looking at my arm. I 10/10 recommend, absolutely coming back for more :’))< /Text>

<Review>What a great experience today was. Today was the 1 year anniversary of losing my mom (and dad shortly after). I wanted a double-heart tattoo to commemorate them. Joseph was there ready to look at my ideas, patient when I had questions, and never made me feel rushed. It came out exactly as I wanted. I have no regrets and would recommend him to anyone.

<rating>5<//rating><review>I had an amazing experience at Paradise with Joey as my artist. He was very professional and patient, making sure I really loved the placement and size of the piece. He really focused on my comfort and continually checked in to make sure I was doing alright. The tattoo turned out perfect, and was centered exactly down my spine. Couldn’t recommend the shop enough, very clean and great music. All of the employees were very friendly and had a great energy. I was the last customer and the people closing made sure I got to my car safe since it was dark out.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Recently got my first tattoo done by Eddie, and his patience and reassurance throughout the process made it extremely enjoyable. I am not only pleased with my first tattoo, but I came to get another large floral tattoo done by Joseph. Joseph walked me through the process, was extremely easy going, and kind, all while remaining very professional. Pricing is fair and all the artist are super sweet and make sure to prioritize and please every single one of their customers! I will be back for more!</Text>

Was in Santa Cruz for a couple days on vacation. Decided to get some tattoos to mark the occasion since the wife and I weren't sure when we could visit again. Eddie did a beautiful, somewhat intricate, little piece on my wife. Turned out great. Justin did a simple little piece on me, quite heavy handed and line work was a little off. But otherwise, not my worst tattoo experience. If I had more time (and quite a bit more cash) I'd be interested to see what some of the other artists can pull off. Next time I'm in town, would visit again: if they would have me in of course, 7/10.</Review>

HOLY HECK I had the most amazing experience here. Justin did the best job ever hooking us up with his spin on some American Traditional flash tattoos! Helped me pick the location, color, design, everything, and I'm smiling EAR TO EAR!!! A million thanks to Justin and the whole crew❤️</review>

Got my first tattoo here from Justin! The place was clean, spacious, and the walk-in process was simple. Justin was great- I was pretty nervous but he quickly made me feel comfortable and excited for the experience. He had no problem changing the design placement until I was happy with it. Definitely plan on coming back here soon!</text>

We came in for an appointment for Joey and got in at a timely manner. The whole shop was very clean especially his station. I got my tattoo on my sternum (between the beasts) and he made sure I was very comfortable throughout the whole experience and even put up a privacy screen. He did an amazing job on both mine and my friend’s tattoo and I’ll definitely go back there!<//text>

Eddie Chavez did an amazing job! 10/10 would recommend getting ink from him! He is so nice, gentle, and incredibly talented! If you are looking for a hyper realistic tattoo, go with Eddie!! His attention to detail is astonishing! Overall, Paradise Tattoo is very clean and has great energy! Will be returning and asking for Eddie:)!!</Text>

<text>Went and got some tattoos with the family today. I walked into the the shop I was destined to visit. I met Justin and we clicked right away. I will come back on an instant to get more work done by Justin.

I’ve been coming to paradise tattoo since it open to get my work done. I’m always met with professionalism, friendliness, and personable artists! :)
Joseph has done most of my pieces in Santa Cruz  - the atmosphere that he’s cultivated in the shop creative, chill, collaborative, and so rad!
Just had the privilege of getting a tattoo done by Mars. Their energy was inviting, calming, professional, and really sweet.
Never disappointed! Always a hella fun, awesome experience.</text>

<review>Spur of the moment a friend and I decided to make good on our matching tattoos. We found Paradise Tattoo and they were able to accommodate us as walk ins. The shop is immaculately clean, the artists are so friendly. Joseph James has such gentle hands and it was an amazing experience being tattooed by him. 10/10 recommend this shop. They are absolutely amazing!</review>< user_name>

<Text>I'm so impressed with the artistry, time and care Joey put into making my first tattoo so beautiful. I came in with several disjointed ideas, and he was very patient with me in parsing out what it was I actually wanted, answering all my questions in a chill, non-judgmental way. He was really easy to talk with, and made the actual tattoo process comfortable and enjoyable. I couldn't be happier with the result: the art is gorgeous, the lines are crisp, the saturation is unreal. Looking forward to next time!</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTx1NcphpkIN5kxFNHulQWGFont6aBYUawyxtT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgc-bwH_e0PXigS6BM95cycuupdMBgF-AyyphR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxVpb4tishGCHCpoIEYQ3TxnAchA6iVv1NIxvP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fb72290866a81:0x5d524821271aa6e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Today was my first time in for the 420 flash that they were doing. They were busy (as expected) but every artist was working hard to make sure every client left happy. Joseph James was my artist and I’m SO happy with how my tattoo came out :) he was friendly, professional, and you can tell he really cares about his work. I’m already planning out my next visit!< /Text>

Just got a tattoo and I'm really greatful they were able to take my friends and me even after hours. The shop has such a chill vibe and everyone seemed really receptive to walk ins and questions. Mars did our tattoos and was really patient and thorough with all of us. Honestly the least painful tattoo I've ever had and it came out better than expected.</review>

<Review>Came in to get a tattoo and Joey did a wonderful job sketching out a personalized design for me! The quality and time that was put into my tattoo made for one of my favorite tattoos that I have so far. He even gave me quarters for the meter outside! So nice! I also got a tattoo from eddie and his skills in detail and fine line are immaculate. Santo also helped me out at the front and while I was getting my tattoo I got a little chilly and he closed the door so I didn’t catch a draft! Everyone was so nice and those hard wood floors are truly breath taking. I will definitely be going back to Paradise to get more work done. Perfection.</Review>< userid>

I cannot say enough good things about this place and Joseph! The shop is clean and open and everybody is extremely friendly! Joseph took the time with me to find exactly what size I wanted my tattoo and made the whole process easy and exciting! My tattoos came out better than I ever imagined! He is insanely talented and gives off such good energy through the whole process! Will definitely be back for more!< /text>

My daughter has been twice to Paradise Tattoo for 4 new tattoos. My dad passed away very suddenly on 12/28/20. Due to the pandemic, I had not seen him since January 2020. Myself & my family are heartbroken 💔

A few weeks after he passed my daughter made an appointment at Paradise. She came home & had gotten the word ‘sweet’ tattooed on the outside of her left forearm - near her wrist. Sweet was my dad’s last name - my maiden name. Joey had done the tattoo & it was very delicate. She mentioned that he had a light touch & was very friendly.

I didn’t have any tattoos but after seeing hers felt compelled to get one to honor my awesome dad. My daughter made an appointment for me today with Joey. I ended up with ‘Sweet’ on the inside of my left forearm near my wrist & another tattoo on my right arm in the same spot.

Joey was so nice. He explained the process throughly & asked me how I was doing while working on both tattoos. I had fun chatting with him (I am a talker!) and learning how he got into the tattoo business.

I would definitely recommend Paradise Tattoo. The establishment was clean, inviting, and the staff was very friendly!<//review>

<review>Definitely a 5-star shop. Every last detail was thought out an executed well, from the neon signs out front to the interior flash racks and the team of awesome artists. Everyone I interacted with at the shop was friendly and the energy inside was positive and welcoming.  I was tattooed by Joey who was very patient with my perfectionism and just had a general good vibe which made it an overall incredible experience. Highly recommend checking them out, 10/10 all the way around.< /review>< Date>

Absolutely amazing shop and even more amazing artist! I had the opportunity to get tattooed by the owner Joseph James and he did an absolutely amazing job just as expected. Their Instagrams really showcases their skill which lead to badass tattoos. I am beyond satisfied with my tattoo, I love it and will definitely be coming back. :)</Text>

<Review>Joey was amazing and knew exactly what I wanted. He was not heavy handed and he ranges from traditional tattoos to fine lines and minimalist pieces.

<Review>We could not have asked for a better experience! From the moment we contacted the artist to the moment we left the shop, we felt comfortable, taken care of and at ease! They did everything possible to make getting the tattoo as easy as possible. The tattoo itself turned out better than we ever imagined! The owner Joey was so accommodating and knowledgeable, we will definately be back!< /Review>< Pics>

The service here was super friendly and felt very comfortable. I had the artist Joey do my tattoo today, he drew out my lotus tattoo to exactly how I wanted it with no problems and was very tentative to the details I asked for. :D<//review>

Came in for a walk-in type of tattoo of a hummingbird and got exactly what i wanted. Mars was my artist and he was really accommodating, professional, and nice to talk to. Everyone in the shop had good vibes and everyone who came in seemed really comfortable. 10/10 will come back<//review>

Very smooth experience over at Paradise. Friendly and welcoming staff.
Eddie is a sweet dude who put a fine line dragon on my belly and a spiderweb on my leg - and I couldn't be happier with my decision to work with him.< /Review>

It was a great experience! Mars was amazing! Super nice during the entire experience! I love the tattoo and it wasn’t painful at all! Comparable to angel kisses even! The machine he used was small and barely made any noises. He was very nice and made sure that I was okay throughout the process! Definitely recommend going to him for any tattoos! The entire shop was filled with nice people and made it feel very calming! 100/10 the best experience getting a tattoo! Mars did an amazing job and made it look even better than I could have hoped! He also has a very delicate hand so it was not painful and all of the details look amazing! Love this place! His Instagram is @cloudsolid definitely go to him!!<//text>

We cannot say enough!! We had a blast, and the artist and art work was amazing! We were from out of town, stayed in Santa Cruz celebrating a loved one who was supposed to had been in Puerto Rico on his 50th but ended up passing away sooner. We are grateful Paradise Tattoo SC allowed walk-ins for all 9 of us. My art work was done by Mars. He is awesome, made me feel comfortable, patient, professional and does incredible work. James and the other team members did a fabulous job. Very sanitary and clean shop. We look forward to returning and referring others to your business. If you’re in town this is the place to go!!<//Text>

I've gotten a few tattoos there & scheduling is always solid and easy to lock in assuming they're not booked up,
prices are pretty reasonable compared to a lot of shops I've been to before in the past too.

If you're in santa cruz & you need a place to get tattoo work done, this is the #1 place to go!</Text>

Artists at Paradise do great work! I've been tattooed by Joey several times and has worked well with me to understand my concept and vision for each tattoo. And does great traditional and black work. I'll come here whenever I have a specific idea for a tattoo that I know the artists will take time to understand and work with me to get it right.< /Text>

I was recommended to this shop by a friend. I’m very happy I went. The shop is spacious and clean and has a great location. Mars did a fantastic job with my tattoo. The line work he did was perfect - about as straight a line as you can get. They are taking customers during COVID, and I felt comfortable with the cleanliness of the shop. Thank you again!< /review>

My experience with this business was great! Friendly, welcoming and open to collaborative influences on the pieces. I got a partial cover up and you can barely tell anyone else touched the area with ink. Fabulous work by Mars, I'll be back again asap.<//Text>

<Text>This shop offered honestly one of the best experiences I’ve had while getting a tattoo (in my case, a 4 hour long one). Joey was extremely kind and made the experience so smooth! Highly recommend this place, plus my tattoo came out amazingly.< /Text>< time>

I got tattooed by Joey at paradise tattoo last night and let me tell you the whole experience was AMAZING!! From beginning to end my friends and I were treated so well. The tattoos came out exactly how we wanted and he really took the time to make sure it was perfect. Unlike other artists, Joey was easy to talk to and get comfortable around. Would 100% recommend anyone looking for a tattoo to come here! The atmosphere in the shop was very welcoming and clean. 10/10 would come again. Best tattoo experience so far!</text>

<review>Absolutely wonderful people and wonderful team of professionals there. The artist who did me and my fiancé’s Narwhal tattoo, Keeli, was an absolutely wonderful, outstanding man who not only provided us with quality tattoos but as I fainted afterwards he helped me and stabilized me from falling and gave me water. His skills with tattooing are wonderful, his line work isn’t heavy handed, nor light, but it’s just the perfect amount of weight. He was so professional with helping us and how he handled everything for us. When we come back from out of town we will definitely come get another tattoo from here. 10/10.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I have been wanting to get a tattoo in memory of my dad for over two years. I found Joseph James the owner of Paradise Tattoo. He is beyond incredible, so talented. I definitely recommend.< /Review>

Felt super comfortable this tattoo shop, can’t say that for every shop. The artist Joey is professional and very sweet. He answered any questions I had and did not rush. Clean work. Great experience and finally found my favorite tattoo artist in Santa Cruz!<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I got my tattoo from Mars, or cloudsolid on Instagram, and it was all around perfect.
First of all, he is overall super nice and chill. He can draw anything you suggest and he will get it exactly how you imagine it. Then throughout the whole process he makes sure you’re comfortable, relaxed and able to keep going. During the tattoo you can just chat and have a nice convo, or if you need to relax he will just focus on the tattoo and not even mind, so he is great for all those introverted snd extroverted people. He is also very nice about working with your budget. You can tell him how much you have and he will completely work around that.
Secondly, just his tattoo machine is the best because it is so quite and feels super nice compared to other tattoo machines. For me it felt the same as someone drawing on my arm with a fine tip sharpie.
Third, the atmosphere is really nice. All the artists seem really nice and welcoming. The shop feels like a place of happy times with people being hyped about their new art or just hanging out with pals.
Overall this was by far the best experience I had getting a tattoo. The tattoo turned out absolutely amazing and I had so much fun getting it done.</review>< Pics>

I came in on Friday the 13th expecting to get a simple tattoo. Joey worked with me and my tattoo idea so well that it ended up being my favorite out of all of my current tattoos. Would definitely recommend this shop to anyone thinking about adding some ink to themselves.<//text>

<text>I’m vegan and LOVE that they use all natural and vegan ink if requested. They’re a new shop and the experience was super positive. Joseph James spent a lot of time explaining the process and I appreciated that. He was also very considerate of the social distancing and taking the extra precautions during all this. Love my tattoo! Thank you!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Ray tattooed both my boyfriend and I. We picked both picked something off the wall, ray alternated them to our request and threw his own spin on them so we could have unique tattoos. AMAZING WORK! We were both blown away and said we were coming back.

I’ve also been tattooed by the owner Joesph and he does amazing work as well!! Can’t go wrong with a shop like this.

Thanks again!!<//Review>

<text>We crossed paths with Joseph about a year ago while we were in town, and since then have been back to see him two more times and will be back again in a few months for more! Paradise Tattoo is the cleanest and most organized shop I've seen. Both Joseph and Ray are not only extremely talented artists, but great people as well!! Their artistry, ideas and clean lines are the best I've come across. Paradise Tattoo will not disappoint! You'll walk out with rad ink, and a love for both the shop and the guys. Thanks Joey and Ray!! See you soon!< /text></record>

Love this place! Joseph is awesome and keeps the conversation going so if you’re nervous about gettint inked dont be. I got my sisters birthday in roman numerals and they definitely helped in sizing/placement and took the time to do whats best and what looked best on me too. Definitely recommend coming in.</Text>

<text>They got me in right way. I had a vision of what I wanted in my head and they made my vision come true. I only get tattoos that mean something special to me and he captured my vision perfectly.The tattoo artist who was also the owner was so nice and professional. He opened the niddle right in front of me and he cleaned everything off before he did anything. The place was very clean and the atmosphere was very peaceful. The tattoo started to hurt but he had something to help numb the area which helped tremendously. I would recommend this place to anyone of my friends and family. I will be going back the this place for all my future tattoo needs.< /text>< pictures>

Ray was beyond cool from the second my girl and I walked into the shop. He helped us both figure out exactly what we wanted, was patient and did AMAZING work on both pieces. We were on vacation from Seattle and this was one of the highlights of our trip. I highly recommend this shop.< /Text>

It was my first tattoo joseph james the shop owner made my first tattooing experience probably the best you could ask for, he made me comfortable when tattooing me, had an amazing conversation actually believe i made a good friend out of it as well but the guy is amazingly talented at what he does he gave me a killer piece that is perfect from the line work to the shading and i couldnt have asked for a better first time experience than what he provided HIGHLY recommend paradise tattoo such an amazing environment and the people all love their jobs and let this be know it was on a walk in! Not an appointment!< /review>

<review>I’ve been to this tattoo shop on two separate occasion. Both of the times I’ve been tattooed by the owner of the shop he’s done most of my finger tattoos such a good quality tattoos and was exactly what I wanted. I’m not from the area I’m from Bakersfield don’t mind coming out here to know I’m working with a chill cool laid back professional person. Would recommend this tattoo shop to anyone who’s in the area! Thank you ✌🏻< /review>< Pictures>

<text>I went in the other day to get my first professional tattoo ever, I was getting a cover up of some of my really bad home style tattoos. Joey was my artist and not only did he do an amazing job but he also helped me pick out a design I liked, personally added onto it because the original didnt have enough shading to be a cover up, and talked me through the whole thing and ended up making it an overall great experience for me. He also a super cool person to talk to and he has great music taste. I'm in love with my tattoo and I'm going back to Paradise Tattoo for more as soon as I can.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I never leave bad reviews because its waste of time, but I will make an exception for this place... got a really bad infection from this place. Spent over $700 getting better at urgent care. Artist was extremely rude/dismissive when I attempted to communicate with them. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, and will never come back here. Enter at your own risk.<//review>< Pics>

<time>1605331957150</time><Review>Joseph James, the owner, did my tattoo personally and let me tell you....he's AMAZING. He treated me with kindness and compassion. He's a great conversationalist, I hate when I'm getting a tattoo and the artist doesn't talk, doesn't make me feel comfortable, and just doesn't make an effort basically. He was busy all day and I didn't feel treated like just another number even tho my tattoo was a small one. He did beautifully and I definitely plan on coming back to him!!!

<review>I have to say, this shop will ALWAYS be my go to when I come into town. We live in Sacramento and wanted to get tattoos before we took our 3 hour drive home. Joseph was great he should’ve been closing shop but said if we didn’t mind waiting he’d get the next person done and shoot us a message. We went to the bar across the way. Btw great environment as well!!  Came back he was just finishing offered us to go next door and grab food. By sh*t it was DELICIOUS. Aye. And when I say I love ink I love ink I like when the artist can input ideas without shredding mine. And he was great. Both my girl and I got tattoos. And will return probably EVERY Santa Cruz visit LOL

Thanks again -Sacramento, Linnea< /review>< time>

Joseph James has tattooed me a couple times now and I've had nothing but great experiences. Hands down the best tattoo artist I've had and have ever seen. Really down to Earth and all around fantastic person to be tattooed by. Will definitely be going back to him again, no doubt about it.< /Text>

My new and only tattoo shop I will ever visit!!! Where do I even begin!!! Okay so my girlfriend and I had appointments with another tattoo artist at a different shop and he totally blew us off 30 mins before our appointment. Luckily we walked in to Paradise Tattoo and Joey and Ray helped us right away.... they took our ideas drew them up in about an hour and a half and we came back and got tattooed.. we were there well after the shop closed until about 12:30am and it was so fun and amazing to see such professionalism from these guys!!! I’ve never experienced such good customer service like this in my life this is my new tattoo shop and these guys are the best and their work is amazing!!

To Joey and Ray:
Thank you guys so much!!! We will see you soon!!!

So happy I met him and he shop is very clean ,sterile, and professional ! If your in Santa Cruz Joseph James is the tattoo artist to go to ! $100 minimum but it’s worth it to me . I could tell he took his time and made sure it was right and I was happy with everything . And I’ll take that over a cheap tattoo anyway !

<Review>Man! I am so glad I found Joseph in Santa Cruz for a tattoo! We were just looking to get a small walk in tattoo but we looked his Instagram up and I had no clue we were getting such a Great artist  ! Joseph is by far one of the best tattoo artist in Santa Cruz . I got a rose and panther tattoo all in traditional colors ! I’m so stoked on this ! It came out amazing and it was my first tattoo. Also I really like how he uses all vegan and natural products . Thxs again Joey ! Can’t wait for my second tattoo !

From Los Angeles to the Santa Cruz waters! We found Jospeh James tattoo in Santa Cruz California . Really good dude to have do a solid tattoo . Myself and my buddy came in Monday morning and got matching tattoos ! Jospeh squeezed us in right before his appointment and we’re so excited with our new tattoos . Jospeh has really clean lines and it was honestly kinda painless . He did a great job and were both really happy with our tattoos</text>
