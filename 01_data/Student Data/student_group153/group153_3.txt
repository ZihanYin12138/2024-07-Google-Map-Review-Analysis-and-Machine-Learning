< review>
I used to be a regular parishioner at this church along with my family until February of 2019. I was in my second year of confirmation and enjoyed the idea of finishing up. However A friend of mine's mother had died from breast cancer that had metastasized to her brain in January. Suddenly that family of six children found that they had to all live, go to college, and pay all expenses off of the meager wage of a construction worker in California who was not getting his wages because of issues inside of his company. So I decided to ask the church for permission to hand out a flyer with a link to a go fund me for the family and collect some funds from any people who were willing to give it to them at the end of mass in their announcements where they frequently ask for money and donations. They did not answer the phone for three straight days. Eventually on Saturday I decided to go to a vigil which was ironically about helping people in their time of need. The padre who was there that day said that he was not part of the church and could not authorize it but that if he was he would give me his blessing to do so, and was referred to Father Eddie Ruiz. Eddie Ruiz said they he did not have a procedure for this at the church and said he would not allow me to do this because he did not know the family directly through the church. After three days of waiting for a phone call that never came, waiting in the rain while writing an email to him for an hour, and multiple hours of waiting, I got a less than 3 sentence reply denying help to this family after being told to follow the church's example and help people in their time of need. On Sunday I decided to go door to door handing out flyers and learned that about $135 had been given to the family through those means by some strangers. After this I stopped going to the church and didn't return to my confirmation. Set me on a spiritual downwards spiral I'm still trying to get out of. I walked into a church for the first time since then yesterday. To any good soul who reads this, I sincerely hope you think long and hard before giving another donation or prayer at this parish.< /review>

Not like other businesses.my answer it was yes I will help you he was happy because he said not a lot of people acting like how you act I really like this place.<//Review>

<Text>New to this parish and was stunned this morning. Someone did not turn off ringer answered a call and had full on conversation during mass. The woman behind me kept talking to her kids throughout the mass. As someone who has gone to catholic school for grammar school and high school and was taught that church is Gods house show some respect. Alot of talking in the church during mass. See what how it goes next week.</Text>< Pictures>

Street metered parking. Indoor/outdoor seating. The cafe area is nice and spacious. Quality and service as you would expect from Starbucks- consistent.

I am told to not park in the Safeway lot, tempting as it may be. Apparently, you may get the ‘boot’ or towed. ... unless you’re shopping at Safeway, of course.<//Review>

How can a person enjoy a delightful drink at this Starbucks if your meter is flashing seizure causing red pulsing lights? But, no worries, the staff here is fast and friendly. Your puppy will have to wait outside  so feed your meter.</Review>< Pics>

Is this the Starbucks that Shuo zeng’s laptop got robbed? I wonder how you will feel if you know a young man got robbed here and caused his life to try to get it back.

May your god bless you!< /Review>

<Text>Indifferent attitude.. Garbage cans overflowing.. And no one seems to know how to make a cappuccino.. It's always made like a latte with too much milk. Peets just half a block way is so much better and they know how to make a cappuccino<//Text>< username>

< review>
It's a typical Starbucks. Friendly counter service and a few stools to perch on to watch the driving citizens of Montclair do silly things at the intersection. Be careful in that pedestrian walkway as you leave , those yellow lines are hard for drivers to see after 3 margaritas at El Agavero.<//review>

<text>The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is a decent place to grab coffee, tea, and/or breakfast and lunch items. It's conveniently located in Old Town Los Angeles with street parking and 90 minutes of free structure parking across the street. I'm not much of a coffee or tea drinker, so my review is strictly based on a couple dishes (which probably isn't very fair considering they seem to be more geared towards the coffees and teas).< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2be2301fc3141:0x27fc448a4f6c9da5<//Gmap_id>< date>

LOVED. IT. This was my first time. I had the Cherry cold Brew tea - let me tell you - it was DELICIOUS! I also had a cheddar jalapeno bagel toasted with cream cheese and it was tasty. The vibe was great. It wasn't too crowded. I will definitely visit again.<//Review>

<review>I really like this location. It's incredibly convenient for me because it intersects so many different routes. The service is consistently good. Its clean. The people who work there generally seem to like what they're doing and are pleasant to talk to. Their Vietnamese Cold Brew is  a must try. I REALLY hope they keep that on the menu.  5 Stars from me.< /review><username>Jackson Ruttan</username>< Pics>

<text>Great place for really good coffee at reasonable prices. Service was also very good. Greeted with a hello and a smile by Juan, who may have been in training. I had questions and they were answered with a smile also. I don't stop to buy coffee very often, maybe once or twice a year. This was a treat. Had a decaf latte and added my own sweetener.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2be2301fc3141:0x27fc448a4f6c9da5<//GmapID></record>

<Text>Today my fiancé Josh and I went to our neighborhood coffee bean.  We usually go there every other day, and sometimes 4 or 5 days in a row.  Today surprisingly, the service was pretty slow. We waited outside in line with about 5 other customers.  Once people would get to the register the next person would wait inside the lobby and stand right inside the door. When the person in front of me approached the register I stepped into the lobby with my fiancee' as everyone before us had done.

We were immediately met with a terrible attitude from someone named Cliff I believe (greenish/yellowish died hair). It was my first time ever seeing him.  It seemed that he was a new manager at this location.  He yelled in a rude/condescending tone "WAIT OUTSIDE!! WE WILL WAVE YOU IN". Afterwards, Josh explained that we were just following what everyone else was doing, Cliff reacted again in a very condescending manner. We stepped out and waited.  Were the first and only customers that I witnessed that had to wait outside until there was  no one checking out at the register.   A few mins later we were waved in by a young lady at the register.

As we walked in, the person waiting in line behind came in as well.  Josh and I waited for the backlash he might receive, but nothing was said to him.  He was allowed to wait inside and order directly after us.  Not only that, but the lady in line behind him, also decided to walk inside.  Once again, no response from Cliff.  I am a black woman, and the only person of color at the store.  My fiancé and I felt attacked, singled out, and belittled. In this current climate, it became pretty obvious what was happening.  Not only to Josh and I, but from others in the store.

Finally Josh confronted Cliff about his aggression toward us.  He said to Cliff, "I don't appreciate your tone that you are giving us."  And then he asked Cliff, "Why don't your rules apply to anyone else walking in the door?"  Cliff simply responded "If you don't like it, go to another Coffee Bean."

We have over 2500 points on our CBTL app, combined together.  a fair amount of them spent at this location. Id like for the general manager and franchisee to know what type of person is representing their store.  I always felt like I was so proud of my coffee shop that I visit almost daily.  Now I cannot say that I feel that way anymore.  I would hate to see Coffee bean face the same negative coverage that Starbucks faced because of a racist manager.  I will not "go to a different Coffee Bean" as he insisted.  But I will document every visit with my camera until he is replaced with a unbiased manager.<//Text>< Name>

<text>I had to divorce Starbucks for my new marriage to this place. Every location is always bright in decor, the Baristas are very pleasant and the drinks, OH MY LORD.... A Winter's Dream hot tea Latte is just what it's titled. I don't know if my honeymoon stage will ever end with this place. I wish everyone could experience them, but it appears they're only on the west coast right now.< /text>< Pictures>

Best coffee in America, bar none!! Real coffee you can drink without cream or sugar because it actually has flavor. You can get them to make a mixture of pure Kenya and pure Kona so you can smell each one in the mix and they will fix the mixture so that the one you want to smell most is the higher percent.  When you make the coffee oh, you can actually taste both.  No need to junk it up with mixtures that mask the taste of inferior coffee.  Real Coffee!!< /Text>

Well I like Coffee Bean and I love their Scottish breakfast tea, tropical passion ice tea, their House Blend coffee, and my all-time fav SF ice.blended mocha drink.  Barristas are nicer and more professional than that other coffee place, and the line moves faster.  I will be back soon.< /Review>

Haven't had good luck here lately. Ordered an Iced Chai Latte to go. When it was served, the bottom half of the drink was still quite warm. That by itself is unpleasant, but it also meant that within a minute or two, much of the ice melted and I was left with a watery, cool chai.</text>

<text>I really like this place (especially coming from the East Coast where it was all Starbucks and Dunkin) but I do have 3 issues.

1. Most of the flavors are mixed with a cream base. It is interesting but for those that can't handle much in the way of dairy, it is an obstacle. The only flavor that is safe is the vanilla.

2. I really love their sandwiches but instead of using something like a Turbo chef, they use a microwave which leaves the sandwiches not tasting as good as they could.

3. I always see an inconsistency in their drinks no matter what location I go.

I will say that I really enjoy the ambience and they have the best pumpkin flavoring I've had from a cafe establishment.<//text>< gmap_id>

Very bad service. I really needed to use the restrooms before Making a purchase and they told me if I want to use the restrooms I have to make a purchase first. I came from a long drive and was planning to eat and drink my regular coffee. They had a big line of people and I couldn’t hold myself. I’m a regular customer spending about $150 a month at coffee bean and that was not acceptable!</text>

Nice place, never a long wait, and friendly staff. However, sometimes parking can be a little hard to find, especially just for a quick stop. Not that great for meetings, with the small tables (inside), a couple of larger tables outside, but almost always taken.< /text>

Good spot, looks great, good coffees and teas, very professional and friendly baristas, and free parking!

A bit small of a location, but it looks really nice, and there's both indoor and outdoor seating so you can still have a quick meeting or check your emails as you sip your coffee.<//text>

I like Coffee Beans in general but this is the only coffee PLACE that does not have any outlets for you to plug in your laptop. I'm guessing it's due to the high traffic surrounding areas since you're only allowed to park for an hour. But it's almost 8pm right now and there's barely anyone here... hence the lack of outlets.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Price and performance match and the coffee was also good to boil. Free internet. One star less because you sometimes have to wait a long time

Took my car in because I had concerns about my brakes. Fid was friendly and funny.  He took the car in and his people checked it out and said my brakes were still good.  He didn't charge me anything and said they'd note it and check it the next time I was in for any service. So honest and Amazing customer service!!. I will definitely go back and refer them to all my friends and family.</text>

After about ten years in West Sacramento and tried a number car repair shops, this is where I come back to get my cars fixed. Simply the best shop in town.<//Review>

<Review>I cannot say enough about the positive experience of my first time at FIds and everytime since then.

Not only were they professional, honest abutjust flat out nice people.  I had an engine replaced and additional work done on my 2004 Honda. They have earned my trust completely and won't take my car to any other mechanics. This includes regular oil changes.

It is time for my car to be tuned up and I am so grateful to have them to do it.

I would recommend Fids to everyone, no matter what the issue.

Keep up the great work guys< /Review>< pictures>

I'd been recommended to Fid's two years ago for some work on my car, and decided that when my starter failed on Halloween, I'd have them take care of it. The estimate was more than fair, and when I towed the car in they offered me a ride home and to pick me up when it was ready. I was prepared to sit there for a couple hours, so that was a bonus. Super friendly staff, prompt service, accurate estimate on how long it would take. I'll be back when the car needs more work, that's for sure!< /text>

I have always had the best experience with Fids. I will always bring my cars to them, they have always been very honest with me, and I get my cars done in a timely matter. It has always been very easy to make an appointment, and then there have been a few times that I thought I had a problem so I brought my car in without a appointment and they took care of my car right away<//text>

<Time>1486499432347<//Time><Review>This review is late, but my experience was worth me remembering to post. I was referred to the shop a local muffler shop. They told me this was a good shop that knew what they were doing and priced fair. Fids did not disappoint. They were friendly, knew their craft very well, and customer service was spot on. Not to mention a place is usually good if reccomended by another unrelated professional in the industry. It is so nice to not be worried about getting raked over the coals for poor work. This was great work for a fair price.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><gmapID>0x809ad14dcb863ecf:0x33ccd1253e1eeaa4< /gmapID><Rate>5</Rate><username>The Fun Bros</username><userid>102989303347050876665<//userid></record>

The owner was very aggressive when I disagreed with him, he grabbed a light acted like he was going to hit me with it. They said a fuel house was changed and failed my diesel due to the original fuel line being replaced. Avoid this place at all cost. Go anywhere but here, I seriously don't know how they are in business still.<//review>

Excellent group of massage therapists here, with the exception of one. I come a lot and find it easy to book an appointment at the last minute- a huge help with my work schedule.<//review>

It's a great place and well worth the price. A few things to note... They could tidy up a bit and do a thorough cleaning. And they need to bleach their towels. They go sour very quickly. Other than that, it's great. Very nice staff.< /Text>

Extremely well maintained and clean. The front desk guys and I believe ' the owner' have been friendly and welcoming.
It is a small spa and has a good attendance. Not to overpacked during 'peak' times.
My last visit found the steam room being redone so it is Currently out of service.</Review>

I started going to this place when it first opened. It wasn’t bad for a $10 entry but they have since change the price twice since then & honestly for $18 this place isn’t worth it. I’ve been to bigger better spas for the same price< /Text>

Photos didn't match the place. Sauna didn't work, regulars said it's a usual problem.  Hour late on Massage,  relief person seemed like it was not his usual position.</Text>

what a disappointment..
first of all, the Japanese massage guy was no longer there!
he was amazing in every aspect like great skills, professionalism, personality, very attractive guy indeed...I miss him..where did he go?
and massage was instead performed by an elder Korean masseur/scrubber...the music he was playing was boring same melody over and over drove me nuts
and massage itself was mediocre at best..oh and while scrubbing my body( I requested body scrub in advance without knowing the Japanese guy was gone already...I should've asked first..) he unnaturally touched/rubbed hard my private part even on my prone position by sliding his hands underneath between my legs(yikes) which was totally unnecessary
and felt violated..and on my spine position..again kept touching the part as if he was trying to achieve something else ...NO THANKS!

now this place became really sketchy place consists of unattractive creepy masseur/scrubber ...two thumbs down
oh, also this time as everyone else mentioned here, the Latino receptionist
had very rude and unwelcoming attitude..this place's literally going down the hill now....NEVER AGAIN.

going back to Riviera spa or Seoul health spa.<//review>

Reasonably priced and clean. The main Mark against it is that the cold pool was tepid, which was a bummer on a hot day. It's been cold in the past.< /Review>

I just Stopped by there on Wednesday afternoon-ish when I drove back to South Bay from near Mexico and the place was cozy, peaceful, down to earth vibe, clean and  dry/steam sauna and Jacuzzi Were nice. I didn't use bio rooms, warm room etc...thus can't comment on that.
I was so tired from driving, stress from work etc ..requested 1 hour massage (their rate was so reasonable compare to other Spa /massage places) and Never regretted.
The massage guy was an Asian, he was nice, very professional & very easy on the eyes...his skill was phenomenal, satisfying and very soothing/relaxing session made me feel refreshed afterwards. If you expect some kinda happy ending/sexual services from the massage guy, keep looking elsewhere. All he does is just giving the superb massage & I'm totally fine with it. next time I go to the area, I'll stop by this place again just to get a massage from him.
Enjoyed this place much better than other Korean style Spas I visited before in whole LA area.< /review>

<Review>The young Lady that works there is honestly the most pleasant... with her professional greeting to every customer... she not only says "Hello, Welcome" she makes eye contact with a genuine smile... I'm new to the area and I could see she had some regular customers and she was so attentive to my unfamiliarity to some products and she would allow me to brows while waiting on customers and check on me and answered my questions no matter how ignorant lol... So ya it's a long drawn out review, and it should be... with everything going on its nice to have someone be genuinely respectful, helpful, educated on inventory and all around just good at her job!!!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

No longer a fan of this smoke shop and i am no longer bringing my money here. They are rude inconsiderate ppl who don't care about consumers. They have their feet on counters watching tv when you walk in , it always smells heavy and dirty plus STALE SNACKS!</review>

<review>5 stars! I go in and I get so lost of how many unique things they sell. I go in there quiet a lot and I never once was disappointed. Their prices are fair, hell sometimes they try to do your favors because they believe in a friendly enviorment. That moment you walk in, I can garente you that you'll feel so welcomed, This place is phenomanal.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>At Vida rescue the people I met were amazingly responsive and kind, which was not my experience with other shelters. I was impressed with how quickly they responded and solved any issues that I had. They also know their cats and dogs well, which means they can match your family with the perfect pet.
Their cats (and I also saw a couple of dogs) are clean, cute and happy. The two I adopted are fantastic purr  machines and they are super patient with my kid. I chose them because they were described as child friendly by Vida rescue and they definitely are!

I really recommend this shelter, you will find good people and adorable animals 😊<//Text><user>114198747905230836417<//user><name>Lisa De Luigi< /name>< Pictures>

< Review>
Prior to VIDA Rescue, I had the experience of trying to go through an adoption process (notice how I said "trying") with another rescue and needless to say, in comparison, I will adopt and recommend to others only VIDA Rescue.

This is the best rescue experience I've had - everything is electronic and they have a simple google survey for you to fill out if you're interested in adoption and it's quick. They also keep their forms updated so you're not filling out something dated 2016.

We set up an appointment to see the available cats and met with Monica. My partner and I told her about what we were potentially looking for (a 3rd cat to be a playmate for our youngest cat so the elder cat can have a quiet retirement) but more so, my partner and I had anxiety about the entire situation in general as introducing another cat could potentially disrupt everyone's routine and most of all, our current cats' behaviors.

Monica was a great listener and answered our questions (no matter how inexperienced it sounded) and instead of us diving right in, she suggested we foster for a month.

Now, it's been less than a month and we made the adoption official. Everything was officiated electronically and done quickly - thank you VIDA Rescue for an amazing adoption experience!< /Review>

I am so grateful that I came across VIDA Rescue. As a first time cat owner, there were a lot of unknowns for me as I began looking for my pet. Out of all the places I contacted, I found Kim and the rest of the VIDA team the most helpful. They answered my many questions and helped me feel like I wasn't in this alone! And most importantly, they introduced me to my wonderful new cat! I would definitely recommend VIDA as a great place to go to when looking to adopt.</review>

My experience with this facility has been nothing but frustrating. I fell in love with one of their available puppies on PetFinder and filled out an application immediately after it had been posted (assuming I had probably been one of the very first applicants to express interest in this dog). It says on their site that if they don't get back to you within a week or so, it's most likely that the dog has already been adopted. I think this is a very unprofessional way of dealing with a potential adopter. Leaving someone in the dark for up to a week wondering if they're going to get some kind of response or not is very dishonorable in my opinion. I filled out the application last Wednesday and it is now Tuesday. I called the facility five times over the course of the last week to get information on the dog's availability and got no answer and no call-back. I just wanted to get ahold of someone that worked there, but their lack of communication was very stressful to me. I decided to drive out to the rescue to talk to someone face to face. They don't allow walk-ins and meet-ups are by appointment only, so I didn't show up expecting to meet the dog. I just wanted them to know I existed and that I was very eager to possibly meet and adopt this specific dog. I talked to a woman at the front desk and kindly explained the situation. I told them I would appreciate it if they could at least keep me updated on the dog's status, so I left my name and number. This happened yesterday. This morning I refreshed the PetFinder feed and the dog I wanted had been taken down (this typically means they've been adopted). So, the reason I'm writing this negative review is because their total lack of communication was very disheartening from the very beginning. I wouldn't be writing this negative review if they had just taken a few minutes to call me back (or email me) and tell me the dog's adoption was pending so I could move on with my life. Why didn't they just tell me this when I was there in person yesterday instead of keeping me in the dark? I hope the dog went to a good home, but I don't plan on adopting a dog from this facility at this point given the situation. If you fall in love with a dog at this facility, don't get your hopes up! They've probably already found someone else and they will not let you know. I'm extremely disappointed in VIDA rescue, please do better.

EDIT: I may have come off a bit harsh in my initial review for VIDA rescue. I don't think they're a bad shelter, I was just salty about their initial lack of communication after I got my hopes up for a potential adoption. But, I appreciate that the owner of the company expressed sympathy in regards to my experience through reading this review. I'm sorry that they don't have enough staff to stay on top off the influx of applications. I just hope they will be able to come up with a system that will allow them to be more organized/timely about getting back to adopters in the future.<//text>

We also receive 30-60 applications for puppies in our care within a matter of days - we are currently training a volunteer to help us keep on top of this. She will likely be emailing you and other applicants for that puppy within a few days, as we only mark the animals as adopted once things are official. We are also exploring automated options for keeping adopters up to date. Because we are completely dependent on volunteers and a few staff, it can be very hard to keep up with thousands of applications and parties interested - each month we get on average 1000-1500 applicants. Our phone line is also our founder’s personal phone, which cannot always be answered - we really apologize for that. As stated previously, because were such a small scale rescue it can be really hard to keep up with everyone’s interest in a puppy. We are working on becoming better on our end - please also reconsider the very negative review status, as these can harm us more than they are beneficial. If you’d like to work with one of us one on one to find a good fit for you so we can make it up to you, you can reach me at kimchenvidarescue@gmail.com.  Thank you!'}</Response>< user_id>

The employees and volunteers a Vida rescue care so deeply about the well being of each animal. I visited the shelter back in February, and while I did not end up  adopting, the individuals I spoke with were so knowledgeable about the animals health and care. I donate each month to the shelter because the workers are doing miracle work! I would highly recommend adopting or supporting this shelter.< /review>

We adopted our sweet Autumn from this great organization. We changed her name to Frida and we are in love with our baby, she's is an amazing dog! I was contacted by Madison the next day after I filled out an application for our baby. Madison was so sweet and you could tell she cares for the animals. Our baby had a cough and needed her stitches from being spayed removed and I was able to bring her to get them to be removed, received meds for her cough, and even got her nails trimmed. We are so happy and thankful to VIDA!!!<//Review>

I called them and told them I was interested in helping out their cause by volunteering. I made an appointment to meet Laura at 11:00 am. I got a message at 10:52 am that she would be there in 5 min. I waited until 11:30 am and nothing. I called her and she didn't even return my call or text me. Not even a simple apology. Very disrespectful.</text>

If you are looking for someplace to adopt a pet, I would highly suggest you find another facility. They are not up front or honest with the information they provide regarding their rescues. For starters, their listing for our now dog said he was 2 years old, however, when we showed up and saw the paperwork, it said he was 4. Not the biggest deal in the world, but why lie about that? Secondly, the paperwork said that he had no behavioral issues. The woman told us that he played happily with other dogs, was good with children and showed no behavioral problems. That also turned out to be a lie. In the 2 months we've owned him, he's growled at my son and bitten him 3 times. To be clear, our son is 7 and would reach out to pet him and get snapped at. He's also charged at and bitten the vet, the groomer, family members, a neighbor, the list goes on. He snarls and growls at children so we just keep him away. We can't have guests over and my son can't invite his friends to play. I understand they want to find pets homes, but that shouldn't be the only goal. The proper goal should be to find a good fit. Had we known he was this aggressive, we probably would have kept looking for a dog that bonded better with children so our rescue can find a more well suited home. It will be more traumatizing to the rescue and heartbreaking for the families to have to return a pet due to aggression or health issues they just can't afford. In addition, she had told us that our dog had seen their vet and had a clean bill of health, however, a day or two later when we noticed his leg was bloody and raw from biting and scratching we took him to a vet of closer to home and learned he had a skin infection that went untreated. When we mentioned it to her, she insisted we see their preferred vet, but after what we found, I wouldn't trust it. We will continue to do all we can for our rescue, however, if he still poses a danger to a home with children, we are going to have to face an emotionally tough and financially costly decision. Find a shelter that is up front and honest with their animals so you know exactly what you are getting into and can make an educated decision that best suits you and your new addition to your family. This place, in my experience, just isn't that place.

UPDATE: Upon seeing this review, VIDA reached out to us and has been more than accommodating and sympathetic to our situation. Unfortunately, in he end, we had to make the very tough decision to surrender our dog. While he is actually a really good dog and won our hearts over, he has some trauma which resulted in aggressive trigger responses that became dangerous for our child. After some discussions with behavioral trainers, the vet, etc. it became evident to us that VIDA may not have seen or known of these aggressive responses during the time they had him in their care.  Maddie with VIDA has been very helpful in taking care of our dog and has been in communication with us to assure us that he is happy, taken care of and most importantly placed in a good home that can better help him heal and grow. Based on their response and communication afterwards, I feel that we all have learned and grown from this experience and I would feel confident in adopting from them again. Thank you VIDA for all of your help and support.< /text>

I adopted my baby boy Wolf from VIDA and they were SO helpful! They drove him all the way up from Mexico for me to meet and adopt him. The woman who fostered him was a true angel. She bought him from a homeless drug addict who was abusing and starving him, giving the man all the money she had just so she could save Wolf from his terrible existence. She fed and bathed him, loved and petted him and helped him not to suffer anymore. He still had fleas when I adopted him and when I told Laura (the head of VIDA) about it she offered to buy the flea medication to treat him. When I informed her I had already had him dipped and bought medication for him on my own, she took $50 off the adoption fee to cover the cost. This is a wonderful organization with amazing fosters and volunteers. Donate, volunteer or adopt from this rescue. ❤️</text>

<review>Laura and the staff deeply care for the animals in their care and work so incredibly hard to get every single dog and car adopted. I recently began volunteering with VIDA, mostly office work, and really admire the dedication and heart of this organization. This dogs get walked about twice a day, are let out and run around time to time and eat well. It’s a very loving facility.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Took in a dog last Saturday, for a week's trial period. Turned out that the cute medium-sized, energetic girl was more attached to me than my husband, who was very gentle with her. I fell in love with her, but it was unrequited. I had to return her yesterday. We miss her.</Text>

I've been volunteering here since December 2018 and I'm still volunteering here... I decided with a group of people to volunteer here together. I would recommend anyone to come here to volunteer, or even adopt a dog or cat!!! They are all adorable. This place is making a change for each and every dog's and cat's lives, and I praise them for this!!!<//Text>

< review>
On 01/07/2019 evening around 7:30, my wife found a ferret with white color fur roaming at the front door  while she was taking the trash out. She was a bit scare about this type of animal and called for my help loudly, then I rushed towards the front door and saw this ferret was roaming around trying to get into my house. I gently approached this animal with a flash light and discovered it was tamed and friendly.Since it was already dark and cold outside. I decided to take the ferret in and kept indoor overnight. Next morning at 8:45, I called the VIDA and talked to Laura about this stray ferret  if she could accept this ferret. Amazingly, Laura was so kind and friendly, saying that there will be someone coming in later at 9:30 to look after it. She also explained to me where to put the cage on the table in front of the office premise. Wonderful place for animal rescue ! Thanks to all volunteers.....< /review>

Laura's got the kindest hearts for the animals but her rescue does need some assistance like more volunteers. Her office definitely could use a hand in  cleaning. Please do reach out to Laura if you have any questions in adopting and rescue questions.< /text>

Sadly the dog we rescued here had aggression and biting history but Laura didn't let us know and we are stuck with a very difficult to train dog. I really wish ViDA was more transparent with us! We really regret adopting from here.<//review>

Great organization. Helps out the community. Wonderful place to visit the adoptable animals.   Only place I'd adopt from.</text>

This store seems to be closed permanently.   Not sure if it will ever open again.   There was a fire at this location in July 2020, no further information.  It's kind of sad that NO ONE has any information on whether or not this place is closed forever, or it it will open again.  Seems like someone would be willing to at least give their customer base some sort of courtesy information.  The owner being tight lipped is really a huge turn-off and it shows a lack of common courtesy.  At the very least, it would be a simple task to put a note in the window letting people know what to expect.  BUT....  nothing.  Boo to PHU QUY BAIT.</text>

Needed live bait early in the morning before a trip. Picked up some worms and some other tackle for cheap, great no-frills service. Was worried about the hours based on past reviews, but was assured the opening times online are accurate (only closed Tuesdays)</review>

I use bloodworms a lot and they're always in stock and in great shape.  I checked out the water system Victor uses for the mud shrimp, etc.  Real clean.

Ever been to the place in San Jose(no names)?  Sold me dead bloodworms and their ghost and mud shrimp are sketchy.  Buyer beware there.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808f8721e20626eb:0x58e5467f6011cdb7<//GmapID></record>

The service was excellent and prompt. Their pizza crust was extremely crunchy and not too sticky. It went best with a can of soda.<//Text>

<text>Love coming here for our pizza. It’s thin crust with good fresh ingredients and it’s ready in 2 minutes!!!   The firecracker crust is really good!!! 😋 The cookies are so good too!!! Can’t wait for the service to open in doors again. Darn covid, but at least there is a patio to eat outside. 😊</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPT2DyYB6J63e4Rxbmvn5zIu2VvsKOrxWbmcIM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkMv1Mges-HrOlFgKjx2x1saCySy3nUgKwWSjt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c34cb4fb91a833:0x81fd47d68507359<//gmapID></record>

It was very fast to order, pay and get my pizza. A lightweight pizza, not as many toppings as Pieology but still decent. Not for people who like thick crust.< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Great new little pizza place near I-10 and Sierra Ave in the Hilton Garden Hotel lot. You decide how you want your pizza made. You walk up to counter and choose your pizza crust, traditional, rosemary, gluten free or others and then walk along the counter where various pizza toppings of vegetable and meats are displayed and you pick out your sauces, cheeses, toppings, etc. There is no limit to your toppings and you can get as creative as your stomach can handle.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Use to like coming here but price hike and the cutback on ingredients giving in the pizzas are not worth the money. Customer service could definitely be better, place definitely need cleaning as when we sat down we sat on a food and seat are torn and filthy. Wouldn't recommend if you seek a good ordering and clean sitting environment. Will not be returning.< /Text>

<text>This spot is getting better! It was a pretty cool spot when it first opened and then I found the quality of food kind of changed a year or so later. But they've definitely stepped up their game and are making their pizzas a lot better and the toppings are pretty good. They now have wings which were very flavorful! And cauliflower and gluten free dough options!< /text>< pics>

Amazing service. They made a mistake in my order (don't worry doesn't happen often) and they make up for it big time. The manager was so kind and helpful (Patricia) the experiences was top notch. You don't find a lot of places like that anymore. Also the food was awesome. Thank you Patty for the help!!<//Text>

<Text>The Pizza Studio is a knock off of the Blaze , Mod, Pieology Pizza and the like. This place is not near the taste and quality of the three mentioned. The pizza dough is so so, the sauce is nothing great and the pepperoni could be a whole lot better. It’s a place that I feel is only 3 star quality. The staff were polite. I personally would look for another pizza restaurant to go to.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>1st visit today and had their Italian Vegan pie. There are a few vegan spots in town I have tried but this simple, quick pizza was better than expected. The staff was politely conversational and responsive to my questions, they use Beyond Meat crumbles btw. It is a faster type food environment (pizza only took a few mins), pizza was very good with great vege toppings which I give 4 stars for, add a star for interaction with staff. = 5 stars. 🙂</text>< pictures>

I've been to pielogy, blaze pizza etc. But none are as good as this place. Their firecracker pizza crust is amazing. The wait is never long. The options for toppings just feels unreal. Artichokes, broccoli, I mean they really have options. They have great service and the cookies they have available are pretty awesome. I've never had a bad experience here. And it's so clean. Sometimes my fiance and I share a pizza. I'm a vegetarian and he's not and they will place it on another pan and put it in the oven.<//review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>We love the pizza here. The variety of toppings really opens up so many possibilities and they taste great. The only reason i deducted stars is for the staff. Each time we go, it feels like their attitudeis getting worse and worse, as if it's an annoyance or an insult that we came to order some food. Either they miss what we ask for or they plain old ignore what we said. For example, one time I specifically wanted the 7" pizza salad combo. However I hadn't realized that the, I'm assuming lead or manager with the collared shirt, didn't hear a word I said and made a full size pizza. At the cashier, i realized they were charging me for a full pizza and refused to discount it even though I had ordered correctly and the employee with the collared shirt heard wrong. We were hungry so I just paid but we weren't happy. I really think the people in leadership with the collared shirts are to blame. They always seem to have the most "whatever" attitude/demeanor which then ripples into the work attitude of the employees. They could use some additional leadership and customer service training, because honestly, I'm starting to get sick and tired of it.< /Text>< date>

DEAD FLY in my salad, and the fly looked to be old. I tried taking a picture of the fly but they quickly took it away to avoid a bad review. They served me a new salad using the same batch that had the fly in that's disgusting. The staff is always rude. Ilene is the one that helped me out she didn't even apologize for the incident. I requested to talk to a manager and Jessica G. Came out from the kitchen also being rude. Worst customer service I've experienced in a while. DON'T waste your TIME and MONEY here. EXPENSIVE.DECENT FOOD. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.<//review>

<Review>Pizza Studio is the best "build you own" pizza place in Fontana. Online ordering is my favorite since I usually order for more than myself. It's very spacious inside, so it's a great place for groups, or big families. If I'm craving pizza, this the place I visit for good quality ingredients.</Review><time>1493143144101<//time><rating>5<//rating><pictures>None< /pictures><GmapID>0x80c34cb4fb91a833:0x81fd47d68507359<//GmapID></record>

Pizza is delicious best place in Fontana Ca. But today one of the girls who was serving me had a really rude attitude . Rolled her eyes while i was asking for toppings on my unlimited topping pizaa. And making smart remarks..it was a shorter chubby girl. Be nice to customers it's not that hard.< /review>

They put too much cheese and toppings to the point where it didn't cook enough
Taking a bite​ resulted in all the toppings falling in a cheesy mess
Second to last slice I found a short brown hair cooked into the cheese.. totally killed it for me

<Review>Pizza is really good and you have a large variety toppings to choose from. The only issue I have is when I order it for takeout, by the time I get home (only 1 mile away), the crust in the center becomes very soggy.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Golden west Collision center has been around a long time. I have had many cars, and many car repairs performed by Golden West. The best thing about Golden West is its culture. Joe, and his staff are very friendly, and easy to interact with. This quality makes it easy to do business with them. Body work is an art form, the car will never be the same as when it rolled off the assembly line, but golden west does a good job getting as close to perfect as possible. Overall, I have been extremely happy with this body shop. I feel comfortable referring anyone who needs this type of work done to them, because I know they will be treated well, and golden west will make it a point to ensure they are happy.

Here is a photo of my car after Golden west repaired it. It was side swiped on the right side, and both the front and rear doors needed to be painted, and the right rear wheel needed to be replaced.<//review>

<review>Great customer service.  Fair price.  Fast.  I don't know what Joe is feeding the employees, but everyone that I dealt with to repair my Explorer was incredible.  They seriously must coach customer service because I've never met so many nice, helpful people at a body shop.<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1613085443129, 'text': 'Awesome,  thank you for the Positive feedback and your business.

My car was sideswiped in a hit and run accident and I brought my car to Golden West.  Joe and his team did a fantastic job with my car.  All the panels were affected in the accident and after the repair, the car looks brand new.  You can't even tell it was ever in an accident.  Because of the amount of damage it took a couple of weeks to fix.  They kept me up to date every step of the way so I never had to wonder what was going on with my car.  The car was ready to the date that they estimated.  I wouldn't hesitate to trust them with my car again!<//text>

This shop is excellent, the owner Joe is fantastic. I'm a collision instructor at a Trade school in San Jose, Joe has hired many of our students directly out of our program. He has given these students the opportunity to  have real world experience working on customer cars. Without owners like Joe, our students wouldn't be able to persue thier dreams< /Text>

Lee (Abenoja) did a great job fixing up some bumper and liner damage on my Honda Accord. His provided estimate was exactly correct in price and he actually got the job done faster than estimated to get my car back in time for Thanksgiving. They cleaned and disinfected the inside of the car up too. Thanks Lee and Golden West!</review>

TOP notch service, and quality.  I had two of my cars fixed at Golden West, and both times were seamless, and outstanding service.  The whole team and Joe made it so easy, they provided up to date status, took action with my insurance company, and both times did outstanding work, making it look new again.  A++ and highly recommended!</text>

<Review>Joe and the team turned 1989 Toyota pickup into a polished classic gem.  Their attention to detail surpassed expectations and the quality of the work was fantastic... They listened to what I wanted and helped to guide me in my choices ( they’ve done this 1000s of times and I was a Rookie) .  I am very pleased with the results. You will be too!< /Review>< pics>

<Review>My insurance company assigned a collision center near my house.  The insurance company offered lifetime warranty if I let them do the repairs with used or aftermarket parts. I talked to Joe McKenna, the president of Golden West Collision Center, and he explained all the details with patience. The cost is more than $20K and my car was less than one year old. Joe and his staff helped me restore my 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV.<//Review>< user_id>

<Review>Unfortunately, I've had to bring my cars to them for collisions. Fortunately, Golden West Collision did fantastic jobs on both of my cars. I don't plan on any more accidents, but if they happen, I'm coming back here!< /Review>< pictures>

< review>
I was recommended by Geico for repairs a year ago. Golden West did a fantastic job repainting my car. Based on my previous visit, I wanted to go back to get my car fixed. Unfortunately, the company failed to follow up with me after submitting the estimate cost. It has been more than a week without a follow-up. Beginning to question the accountability of the management team.<//review>

<text>I love the help and the way this business looks and runs. They called Enterprise rental when our vehicle was not safe to drive after getting hit center T-Bone on driverside. Someone came out to pick us up while we watched for the updates on their mobile app link on our vehicle status 24/7. This feature is a plus and a piece of mind. They have adjusters on duty and work with your insurance adjusters as well.</text>< user_id>

<Review>I had a unique problem. The fender portion making contact near the driver side door had caved in. I couldn't open my car door. It was a major hassle.

Being an old car, replacing the entire fender wasn't going to be worth it. Golden West had a tech come out with his tools and he spooned out the caved in portion in 5 mins and they didn't charge me anything!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

My car got keyed on all three panels at the passenger side. Went to this shop and done the painting. The job is spotless and costed significantly less than what a BMW center would charger. I also had some disagreement with the insurance company with regard to my claim, and some mis-communication happened in between. But Henry, the manager, is very nice and worked very professionally to help me to arrive at a resolution. I am very satisfied with the service from this shop.< /text>

<Time>1559017266280<//Time><Review>Running an honest business!!
Someone bruised their door against my car in the parking lot. I went to Golden west via Geico. I wasnt sure, if the mark can be taken off via buffing or would need a dent/ paint job since it looked pretty deep. However, I asked and received an honest answer that it can be totally taken off via buffing. Not only they took off that mark, but also helped take off couple other buff marks which I ended up putting on the trunk while putting/ taking groceries, which were totally unrelated to the event They also gave me a paint 1x1 for handling chips/ cracks. All done in 20-25 mins. I highly recommend them.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><user_id>114260432054069921149< /user_id><Name>Atul Mohan<//Name><Gmap_id>0x808fb68a9394a101:0x1653ba2b57876842<//Gmap_id></record>

Golden West went out of their way to make sure that the parties involved in my daughter's collision were taken care of and that the auto repairs were completed thoroughly and on time. Having a collision is stressful enough, but Golden West, especially Henry, handled our case with high level of professionalism and care. Their work is warranted and they explained how the auto repair that they performed, addressed safety issues that other auto repair shops missed in their estimate.

Being able to handle insurance issues and rental car right at their shop location made it more convenient. Their shop is very clean, neat, easy to get to and park at.

I want to point out that the more the customer can communicate clearly what their questions and needs are - the better the Auto Body shop can help - it's a two way street, but Henry and team definitely went the extra mile to take care of our parties' collision repairs and get us smoothly on our way.

Thank you VERY much Henry and Golden West Collision Center. Keep up the great work and service.< /Review><user>114001709455166975197< /user><Pics>None< /Pics><username>Julie Tsoi< /username><rate>5< /rate><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I went GWC for auto body work and I must say I had the worst experience ever. Here are the four major points I sent them about my experience:

I had one of THE most terrible experience at Golden west collision. They were very un professional, did not respect schedule, delivery date. They had no regard on how I would be moving around for a week when they were delayed. They promised that they would pay for rental car but never given the fund.

I was not given update on regular basis, specially after they failed to deliver the car on time. I waited SIX days after the due date. I had to call each evening and each time same answer, it will be ready next day.

Although mechanics did fix the body damage however I noticed two new additional damage within the interior that was not there before.

Car had lots of dust inside. It seems they kept my car out in open with door dislodged, hence lots of dust went in every corner of the car.

Car: Audi 2011 black
Job: Fixing body damage on the passenger side doors
Due date: 6/29/2018
Actual date of delivery: 7/5/2018<//Review>

<review>Geico recommended this body shop after I had an incident . Overall my experience was quite unsatisfactory. If I were you I would look for another option. Here are some examples of my experience:

The work was originally supposed to be completed in 2 weeks. The delivery was delayed by 10 days .During this period the communication was very sparse. I had to call everyday to get an update. I was hard to get past the reception and I was promised a call back which mostly never happened.

When the work was finally completed , the hood of the car had a ding. They supposedly replaced the hood with a new one. They took back the car and fixed it ..to their credit. But the 'new' hood still has fine scratches as if they polished it with a hard material or cloth. Very sloppy and  unprofessional work overall.

The overall work was very sloppy. They left artifacts and labels on the material they used , like stickers and labels etc. The registration plates were not fully repaired.

One of the receptionist was very rude and quite unprofessional.

Overall , stay away from these guys. There are  other better options.<//review><Date>1441391558275</Date>< userid>

<Text>I did an estimate here with Geico, then when I called to make an appointment for repair, the lady at the phone said she couldn't find my record. The lady said they and Geico have different computer system, so she need to sync with Geigo agents there to get my estimation. Then she asked for the adjustor's name and said she will call back in 10 minutes. Naturally I never heard from her again. When I called again after a few days, she basically repeat the same stuff and refuse to make an appointment for me. I can sense they are messy with their data internally, and attitude wise I feel she would rather push customer out of door then welcome them in. Don't feel it the right place  to fix my car, so I would try somewhere else.< /Text>< Pictures>

I've taken my car for repairs here twice (once after getting rear-ended pretty badly!). The estimates are reasonable, they provide online progress updates on the repairs, and the people are really friendly/helpful!< /Text>

I cancelled my Geico policy after several bad experience with this collision center. I’ll write a detailed review when I have time, but Geico policy holders, be aware of choosing this one< /Review>

I'm so glad to help I'm always here to serve my customers and the community. I sincerely appreciate your review and you as a customer. I will share this with my vendor Sherwin-Williams as well. Have an amazing day! continuous Improvement is the key."}<//Response><review>It's taken me a little while but I finally got the chance to write a review for the Golden West Collision Center team.  I have to say I am not only supremely impressed but also highly satisfied with the services and follow up received from this company.  Let me tell you that Joe has nothing but the highest expectations not only for his team but also for the vendors that he promotes within the business.  I lived in California most of my life and only used Golden West for all of my vehicle needs/accidents because they have always had great reviews and their work is impecable.  Since then I have moved out of state and now my resources are limited to a more rural market where things arn't easily accessible.  I had some recent top coat pealing from a car they repaired and called Joe and his team up and mentioned my dilema.  It was great to hear that their paint work has a lifetime guarantee and within the week not only did I have several options provided to move forward and fix the paint work but I also had something that was as local as it can get.  I was reached out to by the General Manager of Sherman Williams to schedule an appointment with a local collision Center, prompted by Joe and you guessed it FREE OF CHARGE.  This is why they will always have a loyal customer in me.  Thank you Joe and team!</review>< Date>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>If you are a Geico insurance customer, most likely you will be referred to this poor service Collision center. Unfortunately, I had to go thru this. It took the center multiple delays (3 times, 16 days) just to get the car fix. And it was only the front bumper damage to begin with. The status update is horrible, the auto update from computer system is totally inaccurate, u had to call them to find out the real status. Also, be careful of the lip service from the service folk (His name Henry) had to promise u. He would lie about taking care of your "deductible" just so you won't bug him on promised "delayed" delivery. To make his story sounds even more realistic, they will bring in the owner Joe McKenna to call you and provide similar hollow promise. Overall, if u have to put your car to the shop.....AVOID Golden West Collision. Be sure to have them put in black and white if they promise you something.....Good luck</Text>< pictures>

Bad service. Called in to schedule a repair, asked for an estimate PDF. I emailed the estimate, called back before 5, no one picked up.

Called again and they promised to call me back. No response after 2 days.<//text>

<Review>Love this hospital for the Labor and Delivery unit.  Had my baby here and the rooms are spacious and very clean- also updated. The nursing and medical staff were amazing.  They helped me to have the birth experience that I wanted through their support, encouragement and understanding of the birth process.  I would highly recommend Adventist Health Glendale for your delivery hospital.  Also, the food was great!  Each room has huge windows so you get lots of natural light.

There were two people that were exceptionally amazing in my care while at the hospital. One was the nighttime charge nurse, Jenna, who kindly supported me and encouraged me in my birth plan and supported me and my husband during the whole birthing process. Also, Dr. Shirley Chan who was my OB and was amazing in the care she provided to me throughout my pregnancy and during the birth. Thank you!!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Our family has been to this hospital in the last 20+ years. We love the services here. Seems sufficient training on customer service. Also, I believed that all these worker have been train to serve from their inside, love and passion. We live in Burbank but we desire to come here . The facility is clean and modern. Lots of good doctors with compassion and knowledge.</Review></record>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Just left the ER with my two-year-old who ended up with 3 stitches on her chin after a fall (yep, on Mother’s Day 🙃 -a true mothering experience!). We’re so appreciative of all the staff at Adventist; every person we met was so kind and considerate, and they all tried their darnedest to keep my girl calm during a difficult and tricky procedure (serious kudos to NP Kelly B for staying focused and calm when she started losing it -it had to be so hard). Not the Mother’s Day memory I’d ever imagined we’d be left with, but my daughter is back to playing pretty happily, all things considered. We were seen quickly, the facilities are clean, and the staff’s awesome. Definitely recommend this ER!<//text>< pics>

Overall one of the better medical facilities but why the high dollar pay to park. Not making enough from the high cost of care provided. Plus it's a private garage parking company. $$$</text>

They made me feel welcome and not made to feel like just another "number" to be processed.  Every staff member looked me in the eye and made me feel welcomed coming to their facility.  The health care I received was excellent, if I can give them another star, I would.  Thanks again.</review>< Date>

<Review>Huge shout out to Marissa, Kathleen and Karen from the labor & delivery department. I’d rather keep the details private but these selfless individuals deserve all the recognitions and awards adventist has to offer. The way in which they handled a difficult situation, with such confidence, professionalism, calm and care, I will forever be grateful for. Thank you! .... from: a helpless dad< /Review>< time>

I'm truly grateful for the care I received in the emergency room and especially ICU October 31-Nov 1. They saved my life and gave another chance that I am taking full advantage of. Thank you to the emergency room nurse for being so kind and caring. And big thank you to ICU staff and nurses who helped save my life. I will always be indebted to these people for treating me with dignity and kindness</Review>

the caring attitude of their personnel made me at easy since I am in the most vulnerable group. fearful of any medical facilities because of Covi-19. My request for radiology services was taken immediately with no concern for my Spanish surname, color or age. The services were provided on the day and time given, with no delay and no changes. In simply words: Excellent and great service.
Thanks to all of you, for your care and help to me.<//Text>

< Review>
The hospital in Glendale, CA is not bad, but just for a two hours emergency visit, they charged my SSI recipient mother's Medicare, and Medical and then they sent us an additional bill. They want to collect as much as possible even after charging Medicare and Medical. Then, a few weeks later, we took my mom for a routine mammogram, they took her Medicare and Medical cards again. Charged as much as possible and then sent another bill for that.
Anyway, I try to call them, they kept me waiting with the answering machine saying that they are busy with others. Apparently, so many others have also billing questions and they do not have enough staff to respond to billing questions. They kept sending us two more times by threatening that this is a final notice before they send the bill for collection.
It seems that they are really good at billing and collection after all. So Sad! I will try to not take my mom there anymore.< /Review>

I arrived at 9:00am and was taken in by  9:10.  HInt:  if you can manage it, go in the morning!  I was well taken care of, they ordered multiple tests and had good advice for me.  I appreciated the care and kindness of the staff and their knowledgeable interpretation of the test results.  I must say I was told that if I had arrived at 9:00am a few months back I would have been waiting for 3-4 hours due to the rush of COVID illnesses.</review>

< review>
The hospital was very clean and the nurses were very kind. I think they could better coordinate when they come into your room - no need for housekeeping to enter while the nurse is in the middle of changing my clothes and I’m in pain and clearly struggling, but sometimes the blood pressure guy would coordinate with the nurse so I wasn’t woken up twice. I understand things need to be done at certain times but sleep is also important when one is recovering and in a lot of pain. Overall I felt very well taken care of and listened to. Thank you!< /review>

I spent 5 days on the surgical orthopedic floor at Glendale Adventist and was very impressed by the care I received. The doctors and nursing staff were so kind, attentive and caring! As a physical therapist, it was difficult to be a patient, but the excellent care I received made it much easier. I would highly recommend this hospital!</text>

This is the second time I used Adventist Hospital the first was a disaster, however this visit was exceptional.  I ended up in the ER and I must say the staff who took care of me was exceptional I think one was name Patrick but I was totally out of it so not sure.  The RN was very attentive and Patrick was extremely attentive.  Yes I would recommend this hospital for friends now.</Text>

<Review>I am so happy for choosing Glendale Adventist Hospital for having my surgery. From Pre-Op all the way to my discharge I was extremely satisfied with professional service that was rendered to me. They made me so relax and comfortable even on the time that I waited to have my procedure. Everybody were very professional. Thank you fir looking after me.</Review>< Pics>

Glendale Adventist has to be the best maternity hospital in the Los Angeles area. My wife and I are having our second child here and staring from her OB Dr.Nataly Nguyen , her staff and the hospital nurses and doctors and the staff there are amazing. The rooms are huge, private and you can rest assure you and your child are in safe hands.

Thank you Dr.Nguyen and Glendale Adventist Hospital<//text>

I had an emergency c-section at 29 weeks and the doctors, nurses, therapists and staff were amazing, caring snd went above and beyond. The rooms are spacious and private, the facilities are clean, and the care is outstanding. Also, I can’t say enough about their NICU - the team of doctors and nurses saved our baby’s life and helped him grow and become stable and healthy throughout a critical period of his early life. They are professional, knowledgeable, personable and extremely kind. The NICU cared for our baby like he was their own and the developmental therapist, Meg, was also amazing - thorough, patient and experienced. I am forever grateful to GA and would recommend their labor and delivery/maternity services to anyone.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Im this is the second time I have been admitted to this hospital, 2 years ago I delivered my son here and I must say the experience 2 years ago and last weekend were both so pleasant. I was treated with so much care I felt like my mother was by my bedside. The hospital was immaculate, and considering we are in the middle of a global pandemic Covid never crossed my mind. The care from the nurses that cared for me was like no other and the check in process easy as a breeze. I recommend this hospital to anyone that wants to feel cared for.</review>

I could not have been in better hands than with all the wonderful nurses at this hospital. Such caring and loving souls. I am unable to remember the names of the two nurses that prepped me for surgery on 9/9/20 but both were great. To one of them, "Thank you for your special Victoria Secret line" 😊
After surgery I could not have been in better hands than in the hands of Helen. Thank you so much for being such an amazing nurse, you truly are an angel on earth 😇💖  Last but not least, Trish. Thank you for being so caring and that beautiful smile/laughter of yours that immediately lights up a room. Best of wishes to you next year on your wedding day🤗👰<//Review>

<Text>I've been to the ER twice in ten months. I was x-rayed, treated and on my home in under two hours both times. The second time, just before Thanksgiving 2020, was the height of Covid. I was certain I would be there all night. But efficiency got me out and home in bed where I could rest. The staff has always been friendly and in good cheer.< /Text>< pictures>

Your emergency room truly made a statement last night and today.  I realize the onset of Covid-19 patients seems to have take presidence over any other ailments,  however, waiting from 01/15/2021 @ 1015 pm until 01/16/2021 @ 430 pm is a bit extreme.  I can't believe a hospital of your stature would have "bottomed out" as you did. No one should have to wait that long to get a bed once they have been admitted as I was. I had to leave AMA because of your accommodations.  Your RN's did a fabulous job facilitating my needs. It was your housing supervisor who decided to play "god." This review will be posted throughout the Los Angeles area to inform other patients of your misgivings. Thank you.</review>

Overall positive experience.   Organized.  Professional.  Friendly.   Facility was extremely clean and furnishings well kept.  Temperatures taken at entrance and social distancing maintained.  Nobody allowed into the building unless you had an appointment.  All others must wait in car or come back to pick up patients when their appointment if finished.< /Review>

<Text>Excellent hospital. I just had a laryngoscopy here and it went as smoothly as possible. They provided a very personable touch and I also liked the connection the hospital has with religion and God.

For the past year and a half I have been battling the complications from a double mastectomy. The staff in the Emergency Department always make it a point to be gentle and kind. A lot of smiles. Some laughs but never without clear communication. We drive 30 minutes from our home to get here and will continue to do so every time.

The surgical unit...
I’ve given myself a few moments to think about what I want to say.

Family. That is what the nursing staff of the Surgical Unit is to me. If you have an emotional family, a family who shows continuous affection, then you will feel what I mean. Not know but feel. It is a feeling of safety and foundation. Being able to let go and accept help. It’s what they do best.< /Text>

Total negligence, ignorance and malpractice.  not sure how they are getting 5 star reviews, but something needs to change in this hospital. Do not take your elderly patient here.. they have special protocols to make sure they do not come out of the hospital, after making all they can from Medicare. Their patient coordinator is useless, along with their case management, but they will have to report to higher ups when the time comes. They only have handful of good nurses and rest of them are ignorant, complaining and negligent.< /text>

Doctors and nurses in that hospital are truly heroes. They attended to my needs during and after surgery. Never been in a hospital without a family but these nurses became my extended ones. Surgeon Dr. Merritt was Excellent . Care and professionalism are practiced in this facility , with kindness on top.</Review>

The worst place to go to as a patient.
I went to the ER and after all the tests doctor Harper ordered for me to get ... they all forgot about me. No one talked to me about the results, nothing. Only when I was getting discharged 4 hours later (after I asked about what was happening) the nurse is surprised no one came to talk to me.
They had messed up my files. And from July till today I still cannot see anything in my portal. And medical records are rude and very unhelpful.

I could be having a heart attack and ambulance tells me we’re going to Adventist, I’d  tell them no, please take me somewhere else. I will never go here EVER. I will never recommend ever.<//text>

<Review>AMAZING EVERYTHING!!! Every nurse, tech, doctor, and anesthesiologist on the labor & delivery as well as postpartum floor were the best I have ever experienced! I just gave birth to my first daughter and even with the units being completely full the attentiveness, kindness and compassion each employee had was way above par!< /Review></record>

I had never been to this hospital as a patient prior to this. I had surgery here to have my gallbladder removed. I would definitely recommend this hospital to everyone. Every member of the staff was helpful and caring and made sure that I was comfortable and had all the info and care that I needed to get through it. It was my first time having surgery and I was very nervous, they took very good care of me.< /review>

<review>The care I received was great from the pre-op to the surgery itself.
My one complaint is that it felt like I was rushed to leave the hospital after my surgery. I didn't even get to speak with my doctor about the results of my operation, that was the one thing I didn't appreciate.</review></record>

I was admitted into the ER after experiencing kidney stones. The staff was fantastic through point A-to-Z. Facilities were modern, clean and welcoming. I appreciated the transparency and detail in communication from staff members as well as their friendliness and willingness to answer my questions and make sure that I felt 100% taken care of. Great experience.<//Text>

I would give 5 stars but I can't. For a 30 min procedure I was told to come 3 hours in advance and I was there at 7.30 a.m. waiting for a receptionist to come and tell me where to go....After a 30 min wait I start walking around and found a desk with a security lady who told me what to do...So why not put some signs to follow ...Anyway the procedure was perfect as dr.Yavrouian Robert was perfect as well , so I was very pleased in the end.</review>

This hospital is superlative at every level, from the parking garage attendant, to the intake staff at the emergency room, to the nurses and doctors that supported my urgent medical needs. No  one wants to go to the hospital, but when you do, you just want your dignity preserved and competent attention. You will get both at this hospital.< /text>

<Review>It took less than 5 minutes to check in the ER.  Within 30 minutes I received the initial evaluation and all my vital signs were taken including specimen for lab.  What really impressed me the most was that they started an IV line at the same time my blood was drawn in the event I needed it.  For someone who does not like to be poked multiple times, it was a relief. I was treated courteously and professionally.  The MD and RNs (caregivers) would not discharge me until all my questions had been answered.<//Review>< pictures>

Delivered my baby boy there last week and had the best experience. The nurses in labor and delivery and post-partum were excellent. The anesthesiologist did a perfect job on my epidural. The lactation consultant was super helpful. The rooms were huge and very clean. I would highly recommend!</review>

Received the best care from staff and exceptional surgeon Dr. Peter Ashjian. During my stay nothing but the best in ICU, Med/SURG and all staff in between from CNA’s to PT and Pharmacy. Would like to give a special thanks to Jennifer from ICU she showed me the exceptional care as well as Raquel that was there during my lowest point emotionally missing my family and home. She held my hand and allowed me to feel and cry. The 2 young ladies Alyssa and Hilda were outstanding. Med/SURG very own Madeline, and special Brent (cna) the most caring compassionate man I have met. Can’t believe he said he was 67 yrs old unbelievable. I have so many stories of specific staff that I can share but I would write a book :)
Big Thank You for being professional but without leaving human kindness, compassion and sincerely caring, out of caring for a patient. My most humbling and sincere Thank You for taking care of me and allowing me to heal properly to get back to my family.<//Text>

During my recent visit, all the staff was excellent and very caring! I really appreciate the camaraderie exhibited among staff, and their sense of humor brought some much needed levity to an otherwise serious situation. I also appreciated the doctors thoroughness in running all the applicable tests, to rule out possibilities.< /Text>

Busy Friday night at the Glendale Adventist ER. Expected wait of 4-5 hours. I was suffering from severe abdominal pain, vomiting, possible appendicitis. I really appreciate how hard the staff worked to get me in a bed (as it really hurt more to sit) as quickly as possible. The nurses were very kind and helpful. The doctor had me on an IV and treated my nausea very quickly. Blood tests, urine tests, x-rays, CT scans all seemed through. The tests showed that I wouldn’t need surgery that night, and I was released to recover at home.
While no ER visit is good, it’s good to know where you will be treated well.
If I were to offer any advice, it would be to have places to lie down in the waiting room. Sitting while very sick can be torture.< /Text>

<review>My experience at Adventist Health exceptional. From arrival at Emergency. Entrance and screened for COVID-19 I was admitted to emergency room due to allergic reaction my blood pressure pills which was identified very quickly and started the treatment right away . With in few hours I felt good and transferred to my room for over night observation . Staff and nurses were extremely nice , knowledgable  and detailed oriented and practiced all necessary precarious .
I would recommend this hospital to all my friends who some day  might need theIt services.

<review>Have been here a couple of times now and have always been well taken care of.  It can be very busy some nights in the ER but the staff was always communicative and helpful and once I was inside, did everything they could to find the source of my problem and not leave anything to chance.  While I was sitting in my curtained off bed waiting for results, I could hear the staff interacting with patients, always with kindness and courtesy.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I was feeling falling down when my husband called 911. They took me to ER I can tell in five minutes. 🤦🏼‍♀️The process of result and proper medication was great. I was feeling fine in a matter of one hour🙋‍♀️. I really liked when they got my medical information from my doctor and took the steps as appropriate as possible. In addition, their listening skills and checking the information to make sure was remarkable.⭐️<//Review>

I had 3 tests arranged for the same day.  I arrived early for each one and expected to wait until my scheduled appointment time but was taken early for each one.   It was a great experience because all the check in personnel and the technicians were very friendly and very efficient in their jobs...<//Review>

<text>We came in for my wife's kidney stone.  They released her without giving her any form of pain management and we had to return.  We are still in the ER, waiting, waiting, waiting, for them to rectify their mistakes.  There is no recourse; its just an ongoing terror of incompetent doctors.  The nurses are great for the most part but they have no power.  One of the worst experiences of my wife's life and she is a two time cancer survivor.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I had a triple heart bypass surgery procedure last August 17, 2018
at Glendale Adventist Hospital and remained in the hospital for the next 9 days.  Everyone from the surgeons, nurses, the technicians including the people who brought my meals to my room and the cleaning staff were all courteous in a natural and yet still professional manner. Each one of them made by recuperation much easier.  Recently in April, 2019 I had two stent artery placement procedures surgery done at Glendale Adventist. Once again, all staff members made my overnight stay comfortable and relaxed. The natural caring compassion from the staff begins at the reception /registration desk and continues to the end of my stay in which the hospital volunteers deliver me to my medical van transportation in a wheel chair.  Yes, Glendale Adventist Hospital easily deserves a 5 star rating.</review>

I was very shocked by the level of poor care I received at this hospital.  I would never go back.  I would not recommend it to others. After being admitted to the hospital for a kidney stone, I was released before the stone was gone without any plan for resolution of the problem or pain management.  I had to turn around and come right back in enormous pain.  I was then ignored for hours at a time in the emergency room.  I literally had to unplug my IV machine & heart monitor and stumble through the emergency room area in order to go to the bathroom.  I had to do this again and again as the hours went by.  I signaled for help many times.  The nurse came 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes later.  In one case, 2 hours later.  When I was finally re-admitted, I was treated terribly by another nurse that was annoyed by my crying.  I was crying due to pain, distress and fear.  What an awful place.  I would not wish it upon anybody.<//Text>

The nursing staff in the OB/Maternity Wing are amazing, wouldn’t necessarily give the same review to ER (is any hospital’s organized or efficient though?) that being said I was passed along to the correct department smoothly in the end. Also could add the resident physician was somewhat tactless in handling me and woke me up suddenly to a rather sensitive exam of which he was using to teach two students? Not pleasant for an exhausted pregnant woman in a tense condition. Overall, I will be coming back for my actual delivery (hopefully with a female OB performing), and look forward to being aided by their nurses again.</Review>

The care given here is very professional. All members of the team introduces themselves each day which I liked very much. Very helpful. Report was given at the change of shift and I could listen to it too. RN’s explained medications given and used. Very good drug delivery system .  ID was always checked before any procedure. New gloves were put on before procedures. I especially want to praise a new RN named James.
Elvis was always there when I needed him,he even made me a fan to cool when room temp seemed to be overwhelming. Thank you all very much. May your drives to and from work be fast and safe!

Marina was very good when doing my MRI about a week ago. Very nice and making one comfortable during the MRI.
I was really not expecting the parking rates to be so expensive. I expected a much less expensive rate as other health organizations don’t charge so high. I go to Beverly Hills for some medical appointments and they charge much less.<//text>

I came in to the ER due to complications with asthma and I was admitted over night. The care I received in the ER, and at the hospital was amazing. I felt like the nurses, the doctor and all the staff were attentive and extremely attentive. I can’t remember every person I came in contact with but thank you, Dr. Ahn, Nurse Mark, Nurse Danielle, and the Respiratory Team! You made my stay much easier!!< /Review>

<Review>Very quick and friendly service. They didn't waste my time at all. Robert, at the registration desk (room #4) was amazing. Super helpful and a joy to talk to. The X-Ray tech was really nice and took photos really quickly and professionally.

Top notch experience, save for the fact that my knees are screwed up! Hah<//Review><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2c10b06f8c3c9:0xd71f5ee5c2347add<//gmap_id><Date>1555118203292<//Date><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

I think the only hard part was trying to find the location of the office. Other than that, checking in was easy. Technician was good at making me feel comfortable with the procedure.< /Review>

Glendale Adventist has the best maternity in the Los Angeles area in my opinion. Starting from the doctors to nurses and all the staff even the valet.  Me and my wife are grateful and thankful to everyone at Glendale Adventist for helping us bring our little bundle of joy to this world.  We are most definitely having our second here.<//text>

<Text>Honestly, I was originally hesitant on delivering there because a few years ago 2 of my friends gave birth there and they were unhappy with the staff. But I must say, something has definitely changed at Adventist because every single person was great for the most part. Every nurse had a charge nurse who came and introduced themselves and asked me to let them know if I was unhappy with anything. Everyone was helpful and nice. The only thing I can think of to say is, I don’t ever remember a lactation consultant coming by. The nurses were very helpful in the postpartum room, but I would have liked for a visit from a lactation consultant maybe early in the morning, and I believe I was asked about it later on in the evening. I appreciate Glendale Adventist’s rules about their visitors, they are flexible and accommodating to bigger families and that’s wonderful! As nice option would also be if we could have the option to order food from cafeteria rather than the regular food. That would be great! But thank you for everything, I will be recommending this hospital!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c10b06f8c3c9:0xd71f5ee5c2347add<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<date>1575926502251<//date><rate>1</rate><review>STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!! This is going to a long review but it's worth reading if you ever plan to use the ER at this hospital which I absolutely do not recommend.

I visited the ER room during the evening hours on a weekday as I had pretty severe abdominal pain. There were at least somewhere between 80 to 100 other patients ahead of me. After waiting for about two hours I was called in for the triage (this is where they took my vitals by someone nurse I could swear was an intern) and "assessed" that I needed to wait outside even longer until they found an empty bed to take me inside. After waiting in the waiting area for another hour where it was really cold which was not helping with my pain I asked the staff at the front desk how much longer we needed to wait in which she responded she has no idea and that there were a lot more patients ahead of me. This is when I decided I could no longer wait and left to visit another nearby urgent care. before leaving the ER at this terrible place, I asked the front desk girl that if I left I would not be charged for this supposed "service" and she assured me that I wouldn't. My husband was there and he confirmed this with her again. A week later I get a bill from the hospital for $1,300, of which they've already charged my insurance for $200 and that I'm responsible for the remaining $1,100. Long story short I call the accounting department several times and wrote respectful dispute the charges. All I receive back is another bill telling me it's my final notice. I ask for a detailed statement and a diagnosis because they obviously don't have that as I was not seen or checked by an MD or a PA but they don't have anything of that sort and instead keep lying to me. Today I received a notice for the collection company with additional interest charged on my balance due. One of the several times I called the accounting department the manager named Maria even said to me "I'm surprised they've charged you this amount, it clearly shows no one has seen you and that you decided to leave the ER" then told me she would personally follow up, asked for my number and said she would get back to me. I never received a follow up call or letter or anything. Instead I received the letter from the collection company.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Everyone was very nice, they heard everything I have to say and showed interest in my needs. They did a complete check and gave me the medication that I needed during the time there. It took a while for my results but that's because they did a lot of testing and they sent me home with the best treatment for what I had. Today I'm feeling so much better. Thank you very much much Adventist Health of Glendale for doing what others hospitals don't. You showed me compassion!!!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Really like the attentiveness of the staff in the maternity department. They are very caring, friendly and considerable of your condition.

Absolutely top of the line. Gave me a wonderful room, excellent care. Nurses and aids are very overloaded, some na's I only saw when they came on shift. Too heavy pt load to do what is needed not the staffs fault need more help.
All the tests were done very professional and no waiting. Transport staff are great, cherry and attentive. Food was fantastic, excellent selection, nicely presented. Highly recommend this facility, top docs, everything above my expectations.  Retired acute care hospital administrator

I got the basic testing when I went to the ER the 2nd time and was discharged. My right leg was very swollen and I thought it would be okay to leave. Six days later my leg is still pretty swollen,  but finally going down. I wish there would have been something else that could have been done instead of only going home with a prescription. A couple of times in the past the condition I had was treated with Heparin and the swelling went down pretty fast. Other that that It was good to know that I didn't have a broken ankle, but later to discover what to be a very bad sprain.</text>

Hospitalization is never like staying in a five star hotel yet when hospitalization is necessary, like my stay was, Glendale Adventist Medical Center was very much my first choice.  The hospital itself is clean, up to date, staffed by real professionals and in my case they were right on with their treatment of my condition.  I recommend this hospital unconditionally.</review>

<Review>We just delivered our second baby here. Our first was at another hospital and this one was hands down so much better!! The nursing staff both during delivery and postpartum were amazing. Me and my husband both had such a great experience. They were so attentive and nice, kept everything calm and were very informative.  The hospital rooms were nice and clean, roomy and bright. We would recommend it to anyone.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I've had a couple surgeries there with overnight/next day recovery on the patient floors.  The surgical support staff are top notch professionals with may years of experience.  This is serious stuff and I would rather be here than anywhere else for surgery of any type.

On the floor, you have three tiers of nurses assigned to each patient who are busy but good about answering calls.  Food varies from very good to not so good. Temperature controlled room can be set for patient's comfort.  Leg compressors to prevent blocking an artery in the calf - these are assiduous but necessary.  The bed some will like and some will not.  No satellite radio, lousy TV.  Still you are there to get on your feet not watch CNN.

Quality of care is very high.  The ability of nurses to relate varies, but there are many who find the time to go beyond the technical's and provide heartfelt care (Lily and Shampoo - you know who you are).

Gratitude to everyone.</review>

The ER nurse Gail was amazing and the nurse that took over was so nice and attentive and the nurse Jennifer who took care of me once I got a room was absolutely amazing!  All staff in radiology departments were so nice and attentive.  It was a great hospital stay and the transporters were all so professional as well as the volunteers in the brown uniforms were just amazing.  I would recommend every single department.  Even my mom travels from Panorama City if she knows she needs ER care or the possibility of being admitted.</review>

This place has the most red tape and horribly outdated process and  system.  I will never come here again.  They called me to pre-register, which I did and even paid for my copay, and yet still have to wait an hour just to see the registration people before even going to wait in the imaging  waiting room.  I also had an appointment which apparently means nothing because the registration wait time throws everything off.    I asked them what is the benefit of pre-registration and essentially there is zero benefit as you still have to wait only so they make a copy of your insurance card!!!!! Which they already have and they have checked it in order to collect my copay.  Archaic.  Only retired people with no plans all day can come and just sit here all day.<//Text>

I have always had excellent care at Adventist Health Glendale. This visit I had Dr. Serge Ayvazyan and he was amazing.  So caring and thorough and helped me out right away.  The entire staff is caring and attentive. From the moment I walked through the doors until the moment I walked out I felt taken care of 100%.</Text>

<review>I was born here. Adventist has always done the best as humanly possible in regards to policy structure and overall process.  The only thing I would ask is for the Dr’s and healthcare providers to remember to see us as humans that need the best possible care.  We are not just files or appointments.   I just feel like some steps are rushed. Recently had pneumonia, bronchitis, and a virus as a diagnosis... 3 different visits. Not once was I swabbed, or sent for labs. Not one lab test. I did do two xrays and got antibiotics.  Just do not understand how labs get left out with the condition I was in. Very frustrating.<//review>< response>

One review is too much for the emergency room today. I went in for something minor but needed to be seen. There’s no valet and this horrible parking garage with ppl just hanging out. I walk into the Er and ppl are packed in the waiting room and getting their vitals done in the waiting room chairs. The floors had trash all over them and the place was filthy. The lady in front of me was denied service Bc she didn’t have a ID. The receptionist said it’s California law. But emergency rooms cannot deny care. Then she got to me and didn’t even ask why I was there and said there’s a two hour wait. I was so mortified I left and I would never recommend this hospital or go back ever again.< /text>

<Text>I went in to Glendale Adventist for my annual mammogram and bi-annual bone density.  While I generally feel like it is a very good hospital, although my experience there has fortunately been limited, I feel like they need to update their procedures a little. I have been to other women's imaging centers in the past where mammogram results are given immediately, and if other procedures are needed such as an ultrasound, they are also done right away. I have spoken with my doctor about this, but there doesn't seem to be anywhere in Glendale that provides this service. For such a large metropolitan area, this seems a bit ridiculous. I waited 6 days to get my letter in the mail. For most women, the annual  mammogram is fairly stressful, and if a repeat visit is required, it is even more so.  This process needs to be streamlined. This important annual check should be much less stress and hassle.

The other issue I have is with the parking at the outpatient center. I had my tests originally scheduled on a Wednesday morning at 11:00, and when I got there, I could not get a place to park. I followed other cars (I kept seeing the same cars going around in circles) looking for spots for 25 minutes in the parking garage, then finally decided I had to reschedule.  I went at 8:00 in the morning the 2nd time when I was able to get the tests done. If parking isn't available, parking stubs should not be dispensed or there should be readily available overflow. I won't be going there again at any time except first thing in the morning.<//Text>< Pictures>

Glendale Adventist did a better job this visit than a year ago.  They were attentive to my mom's medications.  I always find however the wait in the ER VERY LONG... My mom came into the ER at 8:30 to 9pm and they did not move her to her room until almost 3am.  That was a 6 1/2 hour wait.  I arrived right after she came in the the ambulance and during that 6 1/2 hours time span, I saw 1 xray given.  I never saw the Dr. at all.  The nurse however, was helpful in answering questions.</review>

<Text>I came to the physical and occupational rehab center for a two weeks stay, hardly able to walk after spinal surgery.  After the 2 weeks of therapy, I am able to do so much now.

If you know you must go into the ER for a few hrs or even be admitted, before you go get your noise canceling headsets out. The noise level is way out of proportion to your comfortable time to help with recovery. The bright 3rd degree lights don't help any either. Take your cap and shades too. The poking and prodding you will just have to put up with. All in all they do a great job!!< /review>

The quality of work was very poor here and I would not recommend going here. I left the hospital to later find out I had additional fractures that the hospital never checked for even though I complained about all the pain. They also referred me to the wrong doctors when I did my follow ups. The nurse rarely checked on me and gave little interest in her job. The management is poor and the doctors need to be trained on how to handle patients.</text>

<review>Glendale Adventist did a better job this visit than a year ago.  They were attentive to my mom's medications.  I always find however the wait in the ER VERY LONG... My mom came into the ER at 8:30 to 9pm and they did not move her to her room until almost 3am.  That was a 6 1/2 hour wait.  I arrived right after she came in the the ambulance and during that 6 1/2 hours time span, I saw 1 xray given.  I never saw the Dr. at all.  The nurse however, was helpful in answering questions.</review><rating>3< /rating></record></dataset><record>

If you have another choice for hospitalization, take it. Although the ED, ICU and clinic staff were great--very competent and kind, the regular hospital staff are not nearly as knowledgable as staff at other hospitals I have been to, and this has been detrimental to the recovery of the patients. Their care is piecemeal, disorganized, and lacking compassion. This is not true of every staff member by any means, but there are enough who exhibit this type of disregard for others' needs that it pervades the entire hospital ward. This is not a place for hospitalized patients to get well; it's a place to lose your faith in the medical system and its ability to heal the sick.</review>

I had a cervical surgery performed by dr Badr and stayed one night at the hospital. I was extremely satisfied, everyone was nice and helpful. Thank you to the day shift nurse Dianne, the nurse assistant Maria and the nurse leader Martha also the night shift nurse Tahj and the nurse assistant Roqelle. Plus who ever that answered the bell promptly .Also I must say that the food that was served was yummy and enough. In general it is a great hospital.< /text>

Every single nurse in labor and delivery were all amazing. As a first time mom, I get emotional just remembering the perfect experience my husband and I had. Every single one of them, I wish I could remember their names, made the nerve wrecking experience so easy and relaxing. Dr. Lantry is also phenomenal at what she does! I couldn’t have wished for a smoother delivery. Every single nurse and doctor who assisted us were so comforting and kind. I wish I could take one home with me lol! So eternally grateful for the experience! Can’t wait to have another baby at Glendale Adventist💙<//text>

The long wait at the emergency room 6 to 7 hrs is too long and definitely needs to improve. I was told that was because of the overflow from St. Vincent's Hospital.</Text>

<userid>107505416844080634764<//userid><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>I have been to many hospitals, many doctors, many ERs in the past 4 years due to, well, chronic health issues, and this one is by far the best. They're clean, well organized, polite, helpful, understanding, all the things you need when you're in a lot of pain!

I would like to give a HUGE shout out to their ER specifically. My boyfriend was in there last week due to a kidney stone, and I was in there the following day for my health issues. Both nights, we were treated with kindness, understanding, and compassion. Every nurse and student nurse and doctor and receptionist and technician and transporter was so super delightful!

I highly recommend this place!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

After suffering for 5 weeks with something lodged in the bottom of my right foot, the pain was more than I could bare, I went to the emergency room of my hospital, Glendale Adventist,  on Sunday morning,  Oct 20! Xrays were taken, showing nothing!  The doctor said he would trim away at the huge callous on the area of my foot where the pain was! After quite a while of trimming away, he said he could see there was something “black”, and continued to trim away.  Relief swept over me...the pain was gone!  The object was removed!
Without that procedure, I would have had to live with that pain!   Without that doctor’s patience, in concentrating and working in that painfull area on the bottom of my foot, that object would still be there, causing me such pain!</review>

The people were kind,helpful and knowledgeable.My one complaint was the parking availability. I ended up having to use the valet parking for $6.50 because there was not a single parking place available in the parking structure. I'm hoping there are plans to fix that in the near future. However, that was a small price to pay for the excellent service I experienced.<//Text>

I say I will give this hospital a 2 star because my cousin was in labor and the babies heart stopped and they didn’t give here c section until she asked the doctor and they said that a baby can last 24 hours without eating. I really don’t like this because they also didn’t tell my cousin do u want to sit up a little instead they had her almost on the floor. The baby was across the room because they didn’t let her have the baby next to her. My cousin felt dizzy and they didn’t give her water until my cousins boyfriend/husband asked his sister to give him  his water to give to my cousin. The nurses are mean because they don’t really act like they see u they act like if u are invisible</Review>

This hospital never fails to illustrate its negligence. My father had a routine angioplasty here last month and has had to undergo two surgeries since then at the site of the procedure because of an infection that caused sepsis. He’s still in the hospital trying to recover from the lasting damage from this hospital.</text>

I live in Downey CA and always drive the 30 minutes to Glendale because I like service so much more than that of the hospitals near my location. I even choose this hospital to give birth and even though I sat in the car for about 45 minutes in active labor I did not regert it because the labor and delivery  nurses were amazing! Thank you to Nurse Stephanie again amazing!!!< /Review>

<review>I love this hospital. I came here to deliver my baby and my experience was fantastic. My Doctor Selena Lantry was on call the weekend I gave birth. She’s the best and I would definitely recommend her. The entire Labor and delivery staff are amazing. They even had a bed for my husband. I knew from going to this hospital for many years that I would have a great experience but it exceeded my expectations. I will definitely have my next child here. Thank you GMAC!< /review>< Pics>

<rate>5</rate><text>I just delivered my 5th baby at Glendale Adventist. It is such an incredible hospital. The staff are experienced, well trained, attentive, empathetic and strive for excellence on even the smallest details. My daughter is also currently in the NICU, and again the care she has been given by the staff is second to none. Many of the staff have been a part of the team for decades, which really says a lot about the quality and relationship of the staff teams serving.</text>< Time>

The emergency room was under-equipped to handle all the sick people on a Saturday evening in mid-March of 2018.  I waited four or so hours just for an exam bed to be available.

That said, once a bed became available, the treatment I got was five-star.<//Text>

Do to my family history with breast cancer from maternal & paternal sides, my annual mamogram visit is scheduled every year at the Glendale Adventist. It's a blessing to be taken care your professional staff with state of the  art technology, 3-D mammogram machines. Thank you for creating an environment that is welcoming.

<Text>Nice Drs, fast service, exorbitant inflated prices. I was there for  20 minutes and received no actual treatment of any kind. More of like a quick Q & A and was charged 550 dollars. For pretty much nothing.... 550 dollars... for a conversation. I'm grossed out by this. What the actual ****. Scam artists.<//Text><Date>1533505822426< /Date></record>

The er checkin was very quick and the emergency services were very thorough.  Dr.  Chiu took care of me and was soft spoken and kind.  The er was clean and well-equipped.  My only criticsm is the portal as I was not able to access my reports until the following day due to a type in my email address.</review>

Don't ever go to this hospital unless you want to die. My uncle was in the ICU and the nurses were hitting him, one nurse pulled out it catheter forcefully and never cleaned the area. The other nurse made him lay in his feces for a long time. Please know we will be filing a lawsuit against Adventist for unprofessional and ethical practice by their unqualified nurses plus staff. They have also committed HIPPA violations.

Screw everyone that works their uneducated unprofessional staff very ignorant people that don't know how to give proper diagnosis.<//Review>

Maybe 4 good ICU nurses the rest are just there to get hours in for that paycheck.  I don’t get it why be a nurse if you hate dealing with your patients.  You tell the nurse hey my family member is bleeding or in pain they say oh yeah maybe I’ll do something about it later I’d rather just stand and talk to the guys. Also there is this neurologist who is a terrible derogatory person.  His name is Dr. Bayton or something like that.  He thinks he’s god and walks on water.  Talks down to patients from my experience.  Also he is mean to patients like they’re just something he has to get over with to get that paycheck. This hospital has great potential but only if they get people who truly care about patients and aren’t blinded by getting money.</text>

<Text>Have had multiple MRI's in the past but this was the first experience with the mirrored mask. Although I'm not claustrophobic I can see where that device would help someone who did. I would suggest to enhance the mask, put a tv monitor in the back of the machine, when my MRI was done all I got to look at was a wheelchair.<//Text>< rate>

<Review>Probably went through one of the worst experiences at the best place possible. I went in Saturday with labor pains and had my birth plan ready. I was very open minded and the only thing I was adamant about was not having a c-section. Unfortunately my body and my baby werent cooperating. I needed help from the foley balloon in order to open up my cervix, I ended up dilated at 10cm almost 16 hours later but was still having issues with baby not being low enough. My labor nurse Jazzmine, was nothing short of amazing. She was nothing but patient and understanding. She knew what I wanted and she took every measure she could to help me reach my natural birth plan. However due to unforeseen circumstances and being tired of pushing for 4 hours and exhausting every other option (such as the vacuum method), I was headed for an emergency c-section. When that was all over I was taken to the recovery ward where Dawn was my night nurse and seriously the best and I truly felt like she was my second mom because she treated me like i was family. I will forever be grateful to her because I felt like i was relearning how to use my body after the c-section and she was super patient and overall amazing. Like I said, best team I couldve asked for in a situation no one ever wants or sees happening to them. Super compassionate and attentive to their patients!</Review><user_id>115615876660476592355<//user_id>< time>

We've had really good experiences at this hospital.  Been going there when necessary for me or my wife for 30 years. Had several operations and lots of testing over the years. They make an effort to modernize and have up-to-date equipment (like MRI's CT etc).  They would get 5 stars, EXCEPT, the psych ward (which unfortunately was needed for mental health reasons) is just like it's from Over The Cuckoo's Nest.  Supervisors are uncaring, nurses walk right by when you're screaming in pain.  No communications.  The psychiatrists are typical arrogant non-listening A-holes with no empathy or sympathy. Lots of problems in the psych ward, so stay away from there!  However, the rest of the place is as good as I've seen anywhere.</Text>

The referral to different specialties was great because it fixed my medical condition or problems immediately before I was discharged free of worries.  The RNs and CNAs in the unit made my stay more convenient providing me a  friendly environment.  Loved the bedside reporting every shifts and the hourly rounding to ensure my needs 24/7.  The Charge RN daily visits is a plus factor giving me assurance  of help if needed.  My nurses have the time to talk to discuss the plan of care  and listen to my stories though i know they were busy as well with other patients.  Parking and access to the building is very convenient. Excellent place of excellent people providing excellent care to patients.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>I have been a patient at almost every hospital in Los Angeles, as I am an accident-prone aggressive sports participant. Glendale Adventist is by far the best of any that I have been to. Whether just the ER, or being admitted, I have found everything from triage, nurses, physicians to facilities are head and shoulders above anything I've seen. Plus They are Seventh Day Adventists, and I am a vegetarian! Lol< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<rate>1<//rate><text>My daughter was recently in the East Wing, in a deplorable room  (1427).  The bathroom was gross, old and moldy.  It smelled like sewage, and there was no hot water...None! She took a cold  shower and was blue!!!
Her roommates bed,  was left unmade after she was released,  and we were forced to look at it all day!  Lastly,  the  food was inedible!
The room is shockingly out of date , dirty looking and creepy!< /text>< Pictures>

Glendale Adventist hospital has been a part of my family's life over the last 20 years. You guys are the best and there's no other place I'd ever go for care.
They know me by my maiden name ( Robin Taylor), and saved my life 10 years ago when I became septic after my colon burst.  5 years ago they saved my husband from a blood clot.
The feeling I feel when we're pulling into the parking lot, is a feeling like no matter what, we know we're in the best hands ever.
I LOVE GLENDALE ADVENTIST MEDICAL CENTER and a big fat hug and kiss to ALL THE AMAZING MEN ABA WOMEN who work there.
From the bottom of my heart, I say THANK YOU💋💝👍
Most sincerely
Ronin Taylor ( Northrop)< /review>

<text>I had a traumatic brain injury and ended up being transferred to Glendale Adventist because Dr. Yaser Badr was the best doctor to determine my course of treatment. Since then, I've had a full and rapid recovery, and my follow up procedures at the hospital have been great. Clean, modern hospital with an above-average nursing staff.</text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I have been to Glendale Adventist for xrays and a dexa-scan and my Internist Dr. Subintha Gill is located there at Lew Medical. I have always had eager and helpful staff pointing me in the right direction. The campus was a bit confusing until I got my bearings, but there is always someone to help you find your destination. The Staff have positive attitudes which make a stressful issue easier!</text>

I arrived to the ER with very high fevers and a lot of pain. Nurses in registration were prompt and nice. Inside the ER , Justin Wu (nurse) and a young lady nurse and male nurse  sorry I forgot their names, were very nice and caring. As soon as I got there, they helped control my pain and fever. After some hours of exams and tests I was addmitted to the hospital. Dr. Ahn and his staff worked very hard get my diagnosis. Mathew, Stephanie, Sousanna, Karen were my nurses and were very profesional and very caring. Everyone here is very courteous and helpful. I never saw a bad face from anyone. All the doctors, technicians, nurses, nurse assistants just the entire staff were great. I really recommend this hospital.</text>

I use to work here and had better treatment rooms years ago
Told the nurse my anxiety was acting up  according to the pa she didn't tell hrs
When the pain did see me in tried to explain what was happening in my blood work she walked away and then sent the nurse into the room with discharge instructions and didn't bother to talk to me until I  made a fuss
I understand it's busy today and I came in for a simple thing but you don't treat patients like a piece of garbage and  not be expected for the patient to  complain</text>

I'm actually very suprised that I got treated with respect here by the majority of the staff, nurses and doctor who attended me. I came in for multiple reasons but one of them was because of my type 2 diabetes, I apparently am eating way too little as I am doing my best to diet and lose weight and well, I had my blood sugar drop down to 58 when I should be around 90 to 140, the doctor was able to help me get it up to about 89 which was the best they could do with very little time, they did lab work on me as well as a CT Scan for my other issue, unfortunately The second problem was sort of a no explanation as the lab work came back normal and my CT scan looked clear of any abnormalities. Over all I am very happy I came to get help. The last time I was at a hospital was asthma related and that was back in 2015 at a different hospital they had me sitting in a hallway with a breathing treatment and I felt weird not having privacy as I was coughing like crazy due to lack of oxygen so to me that hospital didnt treat me as well as Glendale Adventist hospital so if I ever get sick again which I hope I dont, I'll definitely return here.<//Text>

<Review>I was visiting from out of town when a violent case of food poisoning hit me. I couldn't keep anything down for about 15 hours and decided to suck it up and go to a clinic. Being from out of town, I turned to yelp and found this clinic. I called ahead and the receptionist was friendly and helpful-he ensured they took my insurance and gave me directions. When I arrived, they were quick to get me into a private room and every person we came in contact with was friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. This is by far the BEST clinic experience I have ever had. I highly recommend them.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<text>They don't even deserve one star let alone 5 they had my grandmother wait for 12 hours to see a doctor. Across from us was a girl in agony and she waited 10 hours and they didn't even see her, and she left after 10 hours of waiting in agony. Next once my grandmother got back there they made her wait hours and hours for medicine & to hear the cause of what's going on with her. If you want to go to a hospital don't go to this one because y'all wait and wait and wait until you milk up the courage to leave because they don't care how long you've been waiting. Glendale Adventist hospital deserves to be in hell not the hood.< /text>< user_name>

The level of neglect at this hospital towards a person suffering from chest pains was astonishing.  My uncle was transferred to the hospital from a different hospital due to chest pains.  The first day they did an angiogram and monitored him, keeping him overnight.  The following morning he was released from the hospital without a visit from a physician, despite the continuous chest pains and trouble breathing.  Their reason for the release was that he was fine and his insurance did not allow for further care.  For two days he was in pain, until they discovered at another hospital that he had pulmonary edema.  I realize that our current health care system is held at the balls by insurance companies, but this level of neglect for something so serious is beyond comprehension.< /text>

< review>
Okay so no one wants themselves or their loved ones to be in the hospital BUT if that's the case, this is place you'd want to be. My mom had to be transferred here from Bakersfield for a complicated emergency surgery. It was a terrifying experience for all of us but the staff was just stellar (I couldn't even think of a good enough adjective to describe their bedside manner). They were so attentive and kind. Not even just the nurses alone, the doctors, receptionists, the cleaning crew, physical therapists, everyone. You can tell these people really care it's so comforting knowing your loved one is in good hands. Thanks Dr. Badr, Danny, Dr. Habashy, Madeline  (I wish I could remember everyone's name to thank them). But seriously, you guys and girls are literal angels.< /review>

<review>I came into the ER in great pain, but I was treated with respect from the moment I checked in. Immediately after checking in, I was ushered into a small room, where my vitals were checked. Afterwords, I was told to wait in the waiting area until there was a bed available for me.  I did not have to wait very long.  Following that, a nurse visited me and I told him about my reason for coming to the ER. I had a chest E-ray and blood drawn. I later saw the doctor who prescribed medication that I needed to relieve my pain. After a few hours, I was sent home with all test results given to me so that I could take them to my primary care doctor for follow-up the next day. It was an excellent experience, despite my fears and pain.</review><userid>117593933982518660776</userid><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c10b06f8c3c9:0xd71f5ee5c2347add<//Gmap_id><name>Miriam Malabel</name><rating>5</rating><pictures>None</pictures><date>1612918369687</date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Harry Balian (Cardiology Department) is a fraud physician. More than half of Los Angeles or people in the world suffer from Heart failure/cardiac arrest/cardiac problem etc...if you care for yourself or your family member please keep in mind if your loved one is rushed in to Glendale Adventist with a heart problem do not accept this fraud doctor on call. Unless you want to start planning a funeral. Please understand he lies to his patients and other staff. You won't succeed with your health with someone who only cares about his pocket. No form of psychology is used in his approach with family and patients.<//Text>< pictures>

BE CARFUL BEFORE YOU TAKE ANYONE AT THIS HOSPITAL. On 03/15/17 I took my Mother at LAC USC Medical Center when she was very sick. After testing for a few hours my mother was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer. The doctor told us that they have to do more tests to my mom to decide what kind of treatment will she recibe for this type of cancer. I decided to go for a second opinion on 03/22/17 and I brought all the tests from previos hospital at Adventist Health Hospital. They complete all the test again and the doctors from this hospital told us she didn't have any cancer instead they told us she has gallstones s and she didn't need any surgery bc the stones were 3.5mm and surgery was not necessary. This is a tragedy what happened a year later on October 5th 2018,my mother died of a very severe type of gallbladder cancer spread over her liver. My advice for anyone who's getting treatment and a diagnosis from this hospital is to go for a second opinion and 3rd if is possible.</Text>

Great ER nurse team triage and backroom, short 45 minute wait although went in afternoon was seen by nurse practitioner had terrible bedside manner who first gave me wrong diagnosis and was still in training. Never even saw the doctor and I had to let them know my vocal cords were not working causing speech difficulty. NP brushed me off, threw some paperwork at me and sent me away. Would not recommend to my family or friends.</text>

Have been here less then an hour have been placed in a room, free leaking with really kind and professional staff. They have not spoken to me in a demeaning tone and are collaborating with me in my care. Should have never went to California Dignity Hospital where I was in the waiting room for five hours and disrespected my the female nurses. Rather die then go there again.</text>

I had a transient ischemic attack which caused right facial droop, impaired speech, and right side paralysis. I recovered completely. I received excellent care from the ER nurses and doctors, neuro unit nurses, CNAs, Hospitalist, Neurologist, Cardiologist, Interventional Radiologist, X-ray technician, Ultrasound technician, EEG technician, Phlebotomist, Pharmacist, Chaplains, Nutritionist, Physical Therapist, Occupational Therapist, Housekeeper, and Discharge specialist. Everyone was competent, efficient and friendly. And being a vegetarian, the food I was given was great. God bless them all and may they serve many more patients with their excellent care.<//review>

Worst experience ever. After checking in, I was put in room #1 with a nurse who asked me a bunch of questions. Then I waited and was put in room #2 with nurse #2. Apparently they don't communicate w each other because nurse #2 had no idea what I was there for and refused to order blood work like I asked. She was incredibly rude and never looked away from her computer screen. She actually said "huh" a few times while I was midsentence. Then I was sent to room #3 w nurse #3 who almost drew my blood but then suddenly told me just to give urine and wait in the waiting room. Then nurse #4 put me in a different waiting room w a few other people. I witnessed them telling a teenager if she thought they should wrap her sprained ankle. Her response pretty much summed up this whole terrible experience. She said how would she know, she isn't a Dr. Then after being left alone in this second waiting room for hours, I finally was able to get someone's attention, because nurse #4 had completely disappeared. I had to remind them that I still hadn't seen a Dr. Dr came by, barely said a word to me, handed me a prescription and left. Then nurse #5 came by, didn't explain my urine results, just handed them to me, and showed me where the exit was. THIS HOSPITAL MAKES IT A POINT TO SHOW HOW LITTLE THEY CARE. Making a second trip to another ER to get proper care.<//Review>

<rating>3<//rating><Text>I have been to ER of Glendale Adventist Medical Center a few times for my wife and son, mistaking it to be similar to Urgent Care. The facility seems to be good but is very expensive. I have BlueCross insurance and I was charged a lot due to the doctors there not being in-network even though the facility itself was in in-network. And the worst part is that nobody there tells you that the doctor going to attend to you is not in your insurance provider's network.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I had a serious spine surgery but having such an amazing team taking care of me helped enormously! Doctor Badr is a DOer, and an unbelievable neurosurgeon! I came in hurting and scared and next thing I know I was schedule for surgery the next day! His team were on top of it and made sure I was doing well during my stay! All the nurses were kind and supportive, the hospital felt like a 5 start hotel. My mom even had her own bed to stay next to me duringy my recovery. I seriously didn’t want to leave and wished I could pass and do my rehab there as well. Thank you 🙏🏽 and  super grateful Doctor Badr and team for making sure I get the best treatment! By the way I can walk and I’m healing well even though the tumor was close to my nerves, surgery was 100% successful!!! 🤗💕🙏🏽<//Text>< pics>

<review>Had a panic attack after my husband died. They were very quick to check me out and made sure I wasn't having a heart attack. I thought I was going to die. The E.R. Nurse was helpful but he could have been more informative - he didn't tell me to stay away from stimulants and didn't ask me if I had taken anything which I had a 32 ounce of diet coke prior to the event. A week later I had another hospital visit for the same reason. Would have been avoided had he mentioned this. I still think the staff did a great job even with this oversight. I'm sure he had a lot of patients to see.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I had Plastic reconstruction surgery at Glendale Adventist on 01/30/18 with Dr. Peter Ashjian. The hospital, registration, Anethesia, and Nursing in registration, pre-surgery, surgery and recovery were absolutely the best I have ever had and experienced in all the surgeries and hospital care! My surgeon Dr Ashjian is the absolute best in the business! This whole team is the most professional, care and compassion there is!< /text>

delivered my baby here. the staff is nice and the place felt clean however the food here is HORRIBLE. i only stayed for one night and decided to leave. even the cafeteria was horrible. not sure if they even sell food there. the food reminds me of 80s cafeteria food where everything is from cans or processed. i don't know how anyone comes out healed eating the hospital food. no wonder many people remain sick at hospitals. yuck!</Text>

They deserve negative 1000 stars. The level of this hospital's incompetency is unbelievable.
My father has liver cancer, cirrhosis, ascites, and diabetes. His ascites was pretty bad; there was a lot fluid accumulated in his abdomen, which was causing chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea. I called the ER to make sure they could perform paracentesis before taking my father there. The girl (who never introduced herself) on the phone told me that it is something they CAN do. So, we arrived to the ER at 6 p. m. yesterday. The doctor, Nicholas Abram, told us that they couldn't do paracentesis at the ER, so he would get my father admitted so that a specialist can do the procedure at the hospital. He and the nurse told me several times that they would make sure that the procedure is done first thing the next morning (they acted like the doctor made several phone calls to make sure the procedure happens). The only reason why we stayed overnight is the fact that we were promised that the procedure would definitely get done. The ER doctor, by the way, was very unfocused the whole time; he was literally falling asleep in front of my eyes. I even overheard him asking the nurse what day it was when filling up some paperwork (again, this was late in the afternoon).
I went home to get some sleep around 11 p. m. I got a call from the nurse, Stephanie, around 2 a. m. who told me that my father had been admitted and that they would perform paracentesis in the morning, but she didn't have the exact time. I went to the hospital around 7 a. m. today. First of all, I was shocked when my father told me they had given him Tylenol as a pain reliever. People with cirrhosis are not supposed to take any medication that contains Tylenol because it's very bad for the liver. I brought this to the other nurse's attention (Rachel) who said, "OK, I'll make a note." Really? Are you that "smart"? Why should I tell you this? Why are you not aware of this?
Rachel told me that the doctor in charge, Ahn (the spelling might be wrong) contacted a GI that should be coming to do the procedure, but there was no specific time again. Couple of hours later Rachel came back stating that, apparently, the GI can't do the procedure, so they need to find a different doctor. Finally, around 10 a. m. they sent the nurse in charge, Avery, who told me that they need a radiologist to do paracentesis and that radiologists are only available from Monday-Friday, so they can't do the promised procedure today. I can't explain how mad I was at that point. I couldn't believe it. So, they kept my father there for over 20 hours for no reason. I told Avery that this was unacceptable, but she only apologized by saying that the ER doctor wasn't supposed to make any promises and that there was absolutely nothing they could do. I was obviously very mad and increased my tone because the whole situation was simple ridiculous. Another nurse approached me at that point and told me to lower my voice because I was disturbing the other patients. Wow, that's so great you are worried about other patients! I wish my father was treated the same way.
Not only did they not help my father, they made his condition even worse by giving him unnecessary stool softeners that caused him so much pain that he was literally yelling. At that point, we just left the hospital. I couldn't trust bunch of incompetent medical personnel any longer.
After we left, I got a call from Doctor Ahn, who started making excuses about how the hospital had to make budget cuts, which resulted in not being able to perform paracentesis at the ER or having radiologists available during the weekends.
Bottom line, these people wasted 2 days just to charge my father's insurance. Honestly, I don't have any other logical explanation to this whole mess. They could've simply told me from the very beginning that they didn't have the ability to help my father, and would just take him elsewhere.
If you really care about your health, do yourself a favor and avoid this joke of a hospital at all costs.</Text>

I’ve been coming here for many years and until recently the staff has changed. They speak rudely and look at you like you are asking them for limb whenever you ask for the wait time.

My wife was waiting at the ER for more than 3 hrs. I ask to see if they’d found anything on the Ultrasound they did on my wife, The RN Larell was very rude and told me if I needed results of the Ultrasound, that I would need to walk over to the East Tower, take note that my wife is still waiting to be seen.<//Review>

<Review>Horrid experience at this hospital. Thanks to Kaiser not having an ER or a urgent care close I was sent here. Well, they lost my glasses and watch. After months of dealing with them they finally paid for my glasses. Making sure I knew they were not required to do so and only going through my optician. This process took forever and in the meantime I had to use an old pair with the wrong Rx.

They damaged my nose too. So bad that once I was seen at Kaiser the ENT said it was extremely narrow and had trouble getting inside to stop the bleeding.

Lastly, I'm in the process of fighting Kaiser and informed them multiple times. Each time they said they would notate it. However, they turned me over to a collection agency for a little over 500 dollars.

Thanks for the great medical care! Greedy and poor quality healthcare. Similar to SoCal Kaiser, but that's an entire story by itself. They don't even deserve a single star.< /Review>< Pics>

< review>
i have entered in emergency room with 99.9 fever, and been diagnosed;influensa B,after 3 hours,i have been discharged with 101.5 temperature, without any treatment, because i refuse to take X-ray. the reason i refuse, because they had my X-ray results from 30 days ago. So be careful from this building,
they do not have any idea about hippocratic oath. They promise me tylenol to reduce fever, but it left as a promise.They do not realize that they became a animal.< /review>

<Review>Expect to wait around 5 to 7 hours in ER before getting called in these people are pathetic I have no idea how this hospital operates.

The only reason why this has 3 stars is because it's in glendale. This hospital belongs in South Central. Glendale has class how is this low class low treatment hospital even in business this is the worst hospital I've been ever too. Workers here are dumbnuts that will just make u wait for no reason.

I believe whenever they have like 1000 patients they already made their money and they don't care to take more in, therefore;  they just make you wait and waste your time.

I can't wait till that one crazy guy comes here and they make the wrong person wait.

More bad news. UPDATE jan.14.17
I am pulling all of my files and going to another hospital. The doctors are new here and they don't care they will just prescribe you what they want to make your life harder. They are not aware of common anti flamitory iv which I need which was toledon, after waiting a day and half they gave me in a way that I need to take a shot, doctor didn't give it to me in IV, they wanted to poke me, i asked why he told me so it effects fast, if he really cared about me he would not wait forever to give me my toredon. Stay away from this hospital. ER is good but if they try to keep you for the night...you better run.</Review>< user>

<user_id>118005339980244264513</user_id><Text>I sprained my ankle and just to make sure it wasn't fractured I wanted to get some x-rays.  Before I went I checked my blue cross providers to make sure the hospital was in-network. I went around 11pm and got out around 3am to get a total of 3 x-rays.  The total time I talked to or interacted with anyone in 4 hours was about 10 minutes total.  Here is a breakdown of my bill with Blue Cross PPO insurance.  I received 3 bills total.

Company: Glendale Adventist Medical
$710  Radiology (Code: 0320)
$1309 Emergency Room (Code: 0450)

Company: Glendale Adventist Emergency
$366  Emergency Service (Code: 99283)
$78   After Hours Care (Code: 99053)

Company: Los Angeles Radiology Med
$29   Radiology-Extremety (Code: 73610)
------------
Total: $2492

Of the $2492, I paid $1314 after discounts, insurance deductible, and co-pays.

Sticker shock to say the least for 3 X-rays and someone to look at it to tell me if its fractured.  Luckily it was not but I can not imagine what my bill would have been if it was. "Glendale Adventist Medical" is the hospital which is in-network, but the doctor who I got billed for and never saw (Sylvia Kotikan from "Glendale Adventist Emergency") was out-of-network. So even though I went to a in-network hospital, I was seen by an out-of-network doctor and charged more.  When I questioned it, I was told that I can not choose a doctor in an emergency and "Glendale Adventist Emergency" is a different company from "Glendale Adventist Medical".  The only doctor I saw at the hospital was a male asian doctor who I am positive was not named Sylvia.  My only other interactions were with a nurse and a radiology technician but for literally 10 minutes of interaction and almost 4 hours of wait time I got a bill for $1314. I will never go back to this hospital again.< /Text><time>1414799904918< /time><gmap_id>0x80c2c10b06f8c3c9:0xd71f5ee5c2347add< /gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rating>

<review>They made me do a months worth of PT without being able to even ballpark how much it would cost. A month later they hand me a bill for a total of $900 for four sessions (after my insurance discount mind you) which did not reflect half of the payments I made to them.

My mother passed away in March from simple mistake that could have saved my angel mother's life after one month battle with cancer ( she could have lived four more years not one month). Dr. Carvajal seems like caring, but not!!!! I am very devastated on my lovely moms loss and writing this because I don't want any cancer patients die because of this mistakes. He did a surgery to my mom removed a tumor from her colon and didn't give her a blood thinner medicine (for example aspirin) after surgery and she passed away 90% from blot clot DVT (cancer patients are more likely in danger to develop a DVT_blood clot after surgery) and 10% cancer.  After surgery I called his office to FOLLOW UP for my mom's check up and either he was busy or in vacation and his nurse was giving me wrong information regarding my mom's after surgery symptoms(after discharge she had a fever 101, nausea, digestion problems for 4 weeks and guess what ?nurse was saying it is normal.) Suddenly her legs got swollen and  we found that she had a blood clot DVT in her both legs and went to her lung which caused her to die within a week without getting a proper treatment at the GLENDALE ADVENTIST HOSPITAL:(WORST AND HORRIBLE STAFF EVER I HAVE MET).

They discharged her in bad condition with blood in her lungs and swollen legs,couldn't walk at all and "Dr". MANZARI refused to keep her at the hospital and continue in order to get her treatments ( she was having shortness of breath using oxygen machine, and whole body in pain). After the discharge she passed away from blood clot  within a day.

This hospital is treating patients like a business not caring about them and trying to steel money from medical, medicare or insurance companies<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<rate>2</rate><review>POOR. MY MOM DIED FROM CANCER AT THIS HOSPITAL.  I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE DOCTORS  : NARINE ARUTYOUNIAN. I AM SURPRISED THAT THE ADMINISTATION OF THE HOSPITAL ALLOWS IGNORANT, RUDE DOCTOR LIKE THIS ONE WORK AT THE HOSPITAL OR IT IS AN EASY WAY TO ATTRACT ARMENIAN SPEAKING POPULATION OF THE CITY OF GLENDALE. SHE IS ONLY THINKING ABOUT MAKING MONEY NOT TREATING PATIENTS.  SHE IS GOOD AT REFERRING THE PATIENTS TO OTHER DOCTORS. SHE FORCED ME TO CONVINCE MY MOM TO START CHIMOTHERAPY AND FORGOT MY MOM'S OTHER DISEASES AND NECESSARY MEDICATION. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE CALLED A DOCTOR, THIS HOSPITAL NEEDS TO CHOOSE ITS DOCTORS MORE CAREFULLY OR ONE DAY IT WILL FACE A SHAMEFULL LAWSUIT. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE REVIEW ABOUT THIS DOTOR SINCE SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR AND MOST OF THE EXISTING REVIEWS ARE BAD. THE HOSPITAL NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND NOT LET DOCTORS LIKE HER HUMILIATE ITS GOOD REPUTATION AND NAME.< /review>< Pictures>

Once they realized how big they screwed up they addmited me so they could try to prevent an infection that would have been their fault and probably a nasty law suit.

I took my wife to the Emergency Room and in 6 hours they have done nothing to help my wife. We didn't get her admitted until we tried to leave, then after getting her into a bed it was another 2 and a half hours before the doctor saw us. He then prescribed some meds and over an hour later the nurse still hasn't brought them. My wife just wants to go home. This hospital has not helped.<//review>

<text>They were rude to me cause I'm just another homeless drug addict. I was going through withdraws bad and they didn't give me the right medicine for my withdrawals. And they took hours while I'm suffering trying to get me the right medicine for the withdrawals. And also when I got there they took all my clothes and shoes away from me and my cell phone. When I got to a room they gave me all my stuff but they wouldn't give me my cell phone i don't know why they let me have it  the last time I was there. In the morning I was sick as a dog and they were working slow as possible  to try to get me the right medicine they were very rude and unprofessional. And disrespectful. So since they were taking to long to help me i started yelling and they called security on me and they tried to put their hands on me and when I left the security guards said I can't come back to this hospital or they will call the cops on me . and the food is the worst food I've eaten besides jail food. If your a drug addict or homeless they treat you like you trash.<//text>< Pictures>
