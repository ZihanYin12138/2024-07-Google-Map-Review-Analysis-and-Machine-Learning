<review>I went to this establishment after a long flight. It's walking distance from my hotel. The customer was great. I ordered wings and they were delicious. Went back the next day. The same great customer service. This time I ordered the Cedar Plank Salomon and it was delicious as well. I would definitely visit this establishment again.<//review>< Response>

<text>Finally, great pizza in our area. Menu has huge variety of specialty pizzas, pastas, sandwiches and salads.  They even have home made desserts. Best pie in San Diego County!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>This was our second Deluxe pizza and it turned out to meet our expectations.  It lost a star because I was waiting for the pizza just outside of the door.  After a long wait, I had to ask if it was available.  In fairness to the front desk, the task being handled by the order person kept here focused on too many chores for a timely customer waiting response.< /Review>< user>

Excellent pizza. We ordered 2 pizzas- one of which was a gluten free crust. The gluten free was the best we’ve had. Both pizzas were delivered earlier than expected and hot!</review>

Great pizzas and solid variety. No pizza by the slice, but the mini personal pizzas MORE than deliver and you can be certain that they'll be fresh, not reheated. Bravo leucadia pizzeria</Text>

This pizza place completely messed up my order AND there was gross long hair all mixed around in the Lobster Mac and Cheese. I ordered about 40 minutes before closing (I hate being that person, but time gets away from us occasionally). I only ordered 2 simple small pizzas and the mac. When I called the next day to let them know what happened and ask for a refund, they told me I couldn't get one and had to take store credit or nothing else. What kind of business runs like that? I work in food and bev and we always offer refunds when orders go that wrong. Definitely will not be eating here ever again.</review>

When Leucadia Pizzeria opened the Vista location, my family was ecstatic! My kids LOVE the calzone options, and the pizza, pasta, and garlic bread is the best! Wait times can be a little long in the evenings, best to order ahead if possible on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night. The owner is an amazing human being, and she LOVES her customers and it shows. I had an issue with an order one Saturday night, and she called me personally to work out the details and make sure everything was perfect. We will continue to be fans, and will recommend to all of our friends and family. Try them out, you'll be SO glad you did! Try the lobster pizza or the lobster mac, it's seriously amazing!</text>

If you're familiar with the other Leucadia Pizzeria, then you will find the food just as amazing as the other locations. I'm a fan of the cheesy garlic bread and I recommend you try it if you haven't yet. The only downside to this location is the missing seating area. There is a shared courtyard with the taco place next door but not much as far as indoor seating.< /Text>

<review>I love the variety of Italian dishes here which includes subs, pastas, side dishes, and if course pizza. This is our choice of pizza when we get a craving because the size if pizza is perfect and the flavor is amazing. I can't believe it took us so long to try it! Once we did, we never looked back.

Definitely give Leucadia a try on pizza night!</review></record>

It was very good pizza. The garlic bread was odd because it was made on a very sweet bread.</Review>

We're here from out of town and yelped this place and decided to give it a try. Combo pizza was by far one of the best pizza's I've had! We ordered Fried Calamari, Fried Mozzarella Sticks, Chicken Strips and the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich and they were all DA BOMB! No regrets, I would highly recommend this place. I don't really write reviews bit this place was well worth the effort!!!<//Text>

A great and good pizza place. Had lunch there the other day and service was quick. Friendly employees and good variety of food. Lobster mac n cheese was delicious and the pizza was pretty good. Definitely a place everyone needs to try.< /review>

7E2-30D: Good small pizza place that we did not know about for so many years. The order taker/cashier was very helpful. He explained all their pizza options very well. They also deliver where we live,😊,</Review>

I'm a big fan of Leucadia Pizzeria in general, and  this location has always been great in my experience in terms of the quality of food and service. My favorite pies to get from here are the barbeque chicken and margherita, although I feel like it would be hard to go wrong with any of them.<//text>

<Review>Our family went for the first time tonight and I believe it was the owner who helped us. Making the sweet rolled tacos is an art form and our kids loved watching him make them! He was so kind and made us an extra one. They were delicious too! We had the monster ink, birthday cake and mint Oreo. I couldn’t decide on which was my favorite. We will definitely be going back!!!< /Review>< user_id>

We liked it here, ordered the 🍓 shortcake, Monsters Inc, & a cookies and cream shake. We enjoyed them all, the tacos are large enough where they can likely be shared between 2. The monsters Inc is a fun blue color, sweet cream flavored (?), I really liked how the flavor comes out in the 🍓 ice cream.

My only concern would be about any wait times with busier crowds. The ice cream tacos took more time & craftsmanship, about 10 minutes to complete all of our order. We were the only ones in the store at the time, may take a while with more customers.<//Review>

Definitely a cool place to go to. The quality is great! Tons of different customizations and flavors. Cool to see them make it in front of you as well. The price is reasonable and justified. Will definitely be going back.<//text>

Different, but Delicious.
DIFFERENT is Good. Handicap accessible, I took a Group of seniors for an outing and the staff was great help and had very good patience. The only this is that the chairs are a bit heavy for the senior's to move.</Review>

We are obsessed. Always order the strawberry milkshake and the Krispy cereal roll. Love ice cream. This place is not overly sweet, and the boba drinks are so refreshing on a hot summer day<//text>

To any parent who wants to jump start their kids in their journey of dental health: don’t look any further!

I never ever in my whole life imagined taking a couple of 3 and 5 yr old kids to dentist could be this easy and this fun.

Dr B and his team are superb. The whole experience from the parking garage to the waiting room, to the actual dental work to the presents and coming out is just so fun that as soon as we get back to the car my kids are asking when we will come back????!!!

If your kids are anything like mine, they’re not good at waiting in the car to be called in or sitting still in the waiting room. No need to worry and bring a luggage full of toys, they’ve gotten taken care of that.The chickens in the parking lot and the fish tank in the waiting room are guaranteed to keep the kiddos so mesmerized that I had no problem getting there 15 minutes early and let them enjoy.

Then comes the admission, all in a mini laptop in the lobby, pre-loaded and easy to check in.

And the most important part, the actual dental work. I can’t tell you enough about how friendly and kid the staff is, in greeting the kids and clearly explaining to them exactly what to expect. Then offering the menu…yes there is a menu! From which they can choose both flavor of toothpaste as well as the flavor of the vitamin after cleaning! The kids LOVE the menu and that they can make choices. Genius!

And then of course the after dental work presents from. The balloon and the sugarless candy and the toys…

Dr B and his crew have made this experience so well that I’m sure my kids are so well set up to successfully and pleasantly take care of their teeth throughout the rest of their lives AND enjoy it at the same time.

I’m forever thankful to have found Dr B and his team. Keep up the great work.< /Text>

< Review>
I am beyond grateful that Dr. Barrera exists.
On Sunday night, my 2 year old son fell down, which is totally normal for a kid his age.  Except, he fell down tooth first onto cement.  Lots of tears, a busted lip, and an emergency room visit later, he’s mostly ok except for a nasty crack in his front tooth.  The ER did a temporary patch on his tooth, but recommended we see a dentist ASAP.

So the issue now is that when COVID started, my son didn’t even have a tooth, and with us being very cautious during COVID times, we hadn’t brought him to the dentist yet which meant, we didn’t actually have anyone to call.  We started out with our adult dentists, who advised that we actually needed a pediatric dentist.  Cool, we didn’t even know they existed.  Monday morning, we called ALL of them in the Bay Area.  Most didn’t pick up their phones, and the ones that did basically told us it wasn’t an emergency and they could maybe see us in a month since we weren’t current patients.  I’m not really sure how a two year old with a cracked tooth down the middle, in constant pain, and not eating was going to last a month before an initial exam with no promises on when a treatment might happen, but that’s literally the answer we kept getting.

Finally, we called Dr. Barrera’s office.  After describing our situation, his staff made us a priority, and literally squeezed us in to an appointment in under one hour.  I want to emphasize that this was not an easy feat, and the office was busy when we arrived but it shows just how much this team cares.  Dr. Barrera was so kind and patient with our son who was scared and crying the whole time.  After we got x-rays, we saw that the crack was severe, and it wasn’t going to be a simple patch up and our options would be to *try* to save the tooth with a root canal with the knowledge that it could still crack again, or, we just extract the tooth.  The kicker was that our two year old would have to undergo general anesthesia either way.  The complication now was to coordinate the procedure, as it generally takes a month to get something on the books.  But to us, this was an emergency.  It was heartbreaking to watch our son in so much pain, and it had only been 12 hours since the accident!  Not sure how we were going to make it a month.  But Dr. Barrera worked some magic, and while I’m not sure how he did it, he made time for my son and got an anesthesiologist out the same week!

The day of the appointment went smoothly.  Even though we knew we were squeezed in, we never once felt like an afterthought.  His staff was prepared for us, and everything ran right on time.  Both Dr. Barrera and the anesthesiologist talked to us before the procedure, managed our expectations, and again, was gentle and patient with our son.  Dr. Barrera had even went out of his way to get a second opinion and talked to us about the possibility of saving our son’s tooth, but we didn’t want to potentially go under general anesthesia again in the future so we declined. We got a post-op update while our son was in recovery, a follow up appointment scheduled, contact information in case anything was “off” when we got home, as well as a follow up call later that evening to ensure everything was ok.

It’s been a scary week for all of us, but Dr. Barrera showed us so much empathy and made the best out of a terrible situation.  I can’t imagine where we’d be without him but thankfully, we don’t have to.  We can’t imagine going anywhere else!<//Review>

Dr. B is the best pediatric dentist around. I've been taking my kids to him for over 15 years and every experience is great. He is funny, kind, thoughtful,  experienced, and strived to provide the best care to the kids.
His office screams kid-friendly from. Their team is dedicated to providing the best customer experience.< /review>

<review>My daughter had a horrible experience at her last dentist when she needed some work done on her back molars. I looked at all the reviews for Dr. B before I took her in. Juat walking in the staff was a lot more friendly and tailored to what kids love. During her exam she was able to watch TV while the dr told me what needed to be done. Dr. B is amazing and great with kids, this experience alone will keep me coming back. Thanks Dr. B you rock!< /review><Date>1625772479584<//Date><user>100127151114154097349< /user><gmap_id>0x808e3521540cd207:0x6b13059577df101</gmap_id>< Resp>

<review>My 3 year old daughter has been coming to Dr Barrera  since she was 12 months old and we always have a positive experience.  The staff and nurses are very welcoming and make the kids feel very comfortable.  Dr Barrera is very gentle and jokes with the kids during their exams.  The waiting room has lots of fun toys to entertain the kids and a really cool fish tank.  My daughter especially loves getting her balloon and toy and saying hello to the chicken coop that is in parking lot.  Highly recommend Dr Barrera and his team to my friends and family.<//review><Gmap_id>0x808e3521540cd207:0x6b13059577df101</Gmap_id>< username>

<Review>Dr. B has been my children’s pediatric dentist for 5+ years now. He is absolutely amazing. He is kind, friendly and amazing with children. My children love going to his office to see him and his amazing team.
They do their upmost to ensure you are comfortable and extremely confident in their work. They also have amazing bedside manners (explaining everything to the children) before any cleaning or procedure. I cannot say enough positive things about Dr. Barrera and his team. He is fantastic!< /Review>< Pictures>

So easy to work with in scheduling. Everyone who has a hand in this office is pleasant and accommodating. My child is a little shy but they have been tremendous with him. Among the main great assets the DR has is not wanting to rush everything. Giving the child’s teeth proper time to adjust and grow! I love it! The parents are just given information and nothing is forced on you. A gem of a find!</Review>

< review>
I’ve been going to doctor B. For over 15 years and I can honestly say he is one of the greatest dentist. He is amazing with kids and great with teens as well. He works with you on things. Personally I have a extremely bad gag reflex and Dr. B helps me though xrays so I don’t gag. I recommend Dr. B to everyone with kids! His employees are great and very friendly, the secretary’s are so nice and always there for you if you need anything!</review>

<Text>Dr B went above and beyond to repair our 2 year old son’s chipped front tooth. We do not have dental insurance and they worked with us for an affordable solution. He was accessible, friendly, great with kids and his office staff is wonderful. Also very important: he did a beautiful job and he completed the actual work in about 2 minutes somehow! We worked with some tips from @RooParenting and Dr B sent us a photo of himself in his “getup” (he has to wear a gown/mask/goggles because of COVID-19). We met him urgently, then used the 3-4 days before the crown was done to prepare. I bought a little tool set from CVS and we practiced putting the tools in his mouth, our mouths, we “cleaned” the dog’s teeth and talked a lot about going to the dentist. He was still squirming during the actual procedure, but he calmed down after and left with a positive experience. When we came back for our checkup, he was all smiles and asked to go! They have chickens in the parking lot, balloons, candy, prizes... you name it!< /Text>< pictures>

We love Dr. B Pediatric Dentistry. We always feel so welcome and taken care of. The Doctors always listen to our concerns and needs and they work with us as parents and patients to do what is best for our children. My kids get so excited to go to the dentist. I am so happy that Dr. B has made the dentist such a positive experience!<//Review>

Dr B. has been my children’s dentist since the first teeth stared to grow. Dr B and his team always received us with care and knowledge. The office and the environment are all focused on the comfort and well being of children not feeling scared. Easy to make appointments, even if you need an emergency appointment. My kids love going to see Dr. B and his team.</text>

<Review>My two boys have been coming to Dr. B’s office for at least 5 years now. Dr. B and the staff are so patient and make my boys feel so comfortable! They make coming to the dentist a fun experience for the between the flavored toothpaste, tv in the ceiling, balloons, and most importantly talking to them and constantly asking how they are doing. I also trust them with all of their recommendations and know my boys are in good hands. I can tell they really care!!!</Review>< pics>

My son had sensory issues, and I was quite concerned with how he would do at the dentist. As I expected, he was terrified, but Dr. B. spent a lot of time with him, didn’t put any pressure on him, and made him laugh. Soon, my son was opening wide and cooperating completely. All of my kids enjoy their visits with Dr. B. We have never encountered a staff member that wasn’t warm, friendly, and in-tune with my kids. I could not more enthusiastically recommend a pediatric dentist. Dr B. is the best!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
We visited Dr B per the recommendation of our regular dentist when my 6 year old son needed fillings. First we had a general appointment for a check up and just to get familiar. Then we went in for the fillings. Dr B and his assistant made sure everything went smoothly, the procedure was quick and alright. I guess nobody likes dental procedures, my son did really well in Dr B's care. He cares for children, connects well with them. The laughing gas, TV show and numbing injection helped my son relax. He could pick a toy afterwards. We were told in advance that laughing gas is not covered by insurance (a big deal for me to get such information in advance). We were very happy with everything.</Review>

Dr. B. and his team are wonderful.  I’ve been taking my girls there for around 8+ years.  They’re very kid-friendly.  They have TVs with headphones for the kids to watch the entire time, an assortment of kid flavored toothpastes & fluorides, goodie bags with balloons and toys at the end of the visit.  Those are the things the kids remember.  I appreciate how patient they are with the littles and how they don’t push them when they’re not ready for things (full cleaning, X-rays, etc...).  They encourage, not force.  They always take the time to show us where each child needs extra brushing, what they’re doing well, discuss what’s going on with baby teeth vs. adult teeth, etc.  I highly recommend them.< /text>

Facility is clean and safe.  They are very caution of keeping patient away from each other for social distance.  We did filling for my daughter and it was fast and she didn’t feels pain.  She is 9 years old and they gave her the laughing gas to relax her the entire procedure.< /Review>

Dr B has made my 3 children feel so comfortable when getting their teeth cleaned.  He was so gentle helping my youngest get over her fear of getting her teeth cleaned that was caused by a previous dentist. His staff is so kind and thoughtful we could ask for a better team.
Thank you Dr B and staff!!🦷<//Text>

We started coming to Dr Barrera about 18 years ago after my daughter had an awful experience with another dentist. Dr. Barrera was kind and patient with her. He made her feel at ease and enjoy going to the dentist. Since then, both of my boys also enjoy seeing Dr Barrera and his staff. All of his staff members are kind, friendly and do their jobs with a smile. I’m so thankful we found Dr Barrera.< /review>

<Review>Receptionist was extremely nice at first. Then when it came to schedule another appointment and seeing there prices. We needed to look elsewhere. The receptionist became very rude, disrespectful, and threatening to me of what I needed to get done. I went else where and got excellent prices and was not harrassed and pressured into doing things i didn't need to do right away.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808e3521540cd207:0x6b13059577df101< /gmap_id><user_name>Monique Narvaez<//user_name>< userid>

I can't say enough good things about Dr. Barrera's practice.

1. As a dentist, he is extremely knowledgeable about his work. He does not pressure you into anything and will answer any questions you have thoroughly with facts.

His bedside manner with parents is beyond awesome. I have a child with autism. He has gone out of his way to make my child feel comfortable, and more importantly, takes time to talk with me and put me at ease.

2. His office staff is like a family. They are caring and help you with anything that they can.

3. The office is beautiful, modern, clean, and great for kids: train table, fish tank, and TVs in the ceiling for every chair.

I've been taking both of my children here (one typical kiddo and one with autism) for about 2 years. I feel very lucky to have found them...they're just good people.</Text>

<time>1528306242130</time><username>Caitlin Key Alfaro</username><Review>Dr. Barrera and staff are truly fantastic. Both my preschooler and toddler were happy from the moment they walked in the door and saw all the toys and fish tank, right through the exam, and afterwards as they picked out their balloons and "prizes". I never thought taking the kids to the dentist could be such a fun, relaxing experience for both kids and parents! Dr. Barrera and lot of the staff is bilingual English/Spanish, which helped my kids to feel comfortable, as well. Dr. Barrera is very professional and also very gentle and personable. He was accommodating and generous with his time and I'm so glad to have found such a great dentist. As a bonus, there is a chicken coop outside and that just made the whole experience into an great "field trip" for the kids!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Excellent service and much appreciated!

First off the hours are anyone’s guess. They go on lunch for hours and they close well before the indicated time.
Secondly the metal detector might as well be decor because it beeps every time and no one does anything about it.
However the staff was friendly when we went in and no one else was there which helped expedite the process.
Don’t expect any extra communication other than in person though.
Overall my friend got a temporary passport in three days which was great!
Visit the excellent library next door if you’re going to be there anyways.< /Review>

I had an overall good experience here with replacing my lost passport.  I called the embassy 1st and they were helpful. When I arrived, the person at the front remembered my phone conversation. It was a long day, but with their help I was able to go through the process smoothly.< /text>

Very disappointed in the staff. Very rude and disrespectful officer. The officer did not even care to listen to my request or ask me why I am here. Actually shocked and how she asked me to leave and contact the visa center! I had booked an appointment for 15 minutes to speak to the consulate. As a Canadian - I expected better treatment. It’s quite shameful that such officers represent our country abroad.</review>

Chantal is usually the person I deal with and I've never ever experienced anything but kindness, respect and great efficient service.   In and out in less than 15 minutes. For people who are not 100% satisfied  I have to wonder whether you showed up w/o calling beforehand to find out whether they can handle your request and if so, what documents are needed to process your request. If you do your homework before you arrive, the experience will be much better in my opinion.</text>< Pictures>

It is essentially impossible to talk to a human being over the phone. After listening to a message that was over 5 minutes long there is no option to actually speak with someone. I have called the Canadian Consulates in Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles and there is no way to ask a simple visa-related question. Absolutely ridiculous.<//text>

<Text>The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the hours. They are closed from 12-1:30, but it's not listed anywhere on the site. I got the 5 minutes after 12, so I had a bit of a wait. Besides that, I don't have a complaint.  They were very helpful, especially Chantal, she went above and beyond for me and it was SO appreciated. THANK YOU!!!!!< /Text>< username>

Great service all around. Not sure what people complain about or why bad reviews exist but I'm pretty sure it's because people missed flights or didn't get their visas/passports which is not the consulate's fault.  The American version of this office would not be nearly as nice I'm fairly certain of it. Keep up the great work!<//review>

<Text>Most horrific consulate experience I have ever had and I applied visas to many countries, this is the far the worst one. We initially try to do a tourist visa application online as they would encourage on their website. I know my way around computers, however the application process after so many attempts, reading blogs to understand what might we be doing wrong, just could not submitted after working on the online visa application on Canadian website for 4 days. We gave up and printed the hard copy of the application and mailed it to the address given on the website. 2 weeks passed, no news so we decided to drive to Los Angeles from Phoenix where I live It is about 7 hours drive. When we get there, it took them 1 hour to find the application after begging the security guard to provide help as he said this consulate is for only Canadian Citizens and for questions, we need to send email. Before going to LA, I have tried to reach a live person so many times, and numerous emails, no response, no live person on the phone to provide assistance, therefore we decided to drive. Anyway, security guard decided to help us and ask consulate to search our application which took them 1 hour to find. After finding the application, the person works for Canadian Embassy told us that we mailed it the application to a wrong address. We told them it is the address provided in their website and she said the visa office actually moved to a different location. Wait now, you have 2 offices apart 30 minutes from each other handling different consulate matters ? Give me a break. If it is, then why don't you say that in your Website, which is not efficient, frustrating and useless. Anyways, we decided to drive to their new office of visa application center and when we got there, they told us that before our trip which was 2 days ahead, they can not promise to issue a tourist visa which was the purpose of the catching an Alaska Cruise. Unfortunately, cruise line did not accept to refund our money neither give us credit for some other cruise time. Airlines, we got credit, not refund, hotels in Vancouver was also not refundable. This is a terrible experience from a country that I heard many good stories, how liberal they are and how nice Canadians are which I have no doubt, But their consulate is a complete failure.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I have a hard time understanding the 5-star reviews here. Not one of the 5-star reviews equal my experience. Are we talking about the Canadian Consulate in Los Angeles?  Every attempt I made for days to get in contact with someone I could talk to about my “urgent” visa to Canada where I am scheduled to speak on December 2,  at the Neural Information Processing System Conference (NIPS), a very important conference for furthering my computer scientist engineer program,  was answered by a prompt referring me to a website and/or email address. I applied for this visa on October 19 and to date I have not received any response nor can I get in contact with anyone at the consulate to inform me of the status of my visa. I’m very frustrated and don’t know what to do. I’m a PH Degree student from China and am finding this experience extremely unprofessional. So I would like to know how did the 5-star reviewers get their excellent service from the Canadian Consulate so that I can follow their footsteps.< /Review>

It opens at 10am, not 8:30am. It's been that way since 2013 as the paper sign in the hallway says. Once they opened at 10am everything went very quickly and the person that helped me was friendly and efficient - knew my name and remembered our previous phone conversations. If I had known about this office I would have come here first before trying to renew my Canadian passport by mail. Overall a positive experience. Now please update your office hours.< /Text>

The staff in this Consulate should be rewarded for rising above the systems and processes of a bureaucracy to really help people in difficult situations.  My wife was not able to board the ship with me and my son for our Alaska cruise because she did not have a Canadian visa.  She wrote to them explaining the situation, and within hours the visa was processed and issued on-site. She was able to join us in Juneau because someone read the message, understood the situation, and responded urgently and positively.  We have never before received such fast, friendly, and helpful support from any other official agency.  Thank you to the staff of this Consulate, and keep up the good work!!</text>

<Review>The most disgusting service ever had.My daughter is stuck in US for the past 3 weeks just because of the delay in processing transit visa. Now we don't need visa as she already missed the flight.Have been contacting the consulate for the past 10days just to return the passport. Never ever....ever...travel via Canada.....worst experience and worst service!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

The embassy location is convenient, but there is no communication between the embassy employees and the visa applicant about the visa progress. They send applicant passport with the supporting documents to another place in Los Angles without even reviewing the files properly to make sure that he or she will receive the visa. It seems to me that these guys reject  majority of the people without proper explanation/reviewing. If you doubt to apply at this embassy, I hardly recommend to not to waist your time and money,,,,, Try somewhere else,,,,,,<//text>

<review>Zero stars honestly! We were flying through Canada to Japan and could not get a transit visa on time. Even though the website explicitly says that there is no transit visa fee, after having our passports for more than a week, we get an intimation from the consulate saying, the fee wasnt paid. So, we quickly send cashiers check and send them photos of the check- response being, oh well, the issue of visa is still going to take 15 days!  First never fly through/to Canada unless you want your travel to be a gamble!< /review>< Pictures>

Is it too much to ask for the government to at least post _correct_ office hours?

The jackass security informed me that things close at 3 PM, which isn't exactly the 4:30 PM advertised on the Consulate website.

"Peace, order, and good government" isn't just a platitude, it's supposed to mean something.</Review>

Don’t respond to all emails and even if they do it’s very slow, there’s no way to track your progression for your visa, they leave you in the grey areanwithout saying anything. Awful experience.</Text>

NEVER TAKE A TRANSIT IN CANADA!!!!I need a transit visa for a layover of my flight. Online app said the fee for transit visa was $0, but when I send me passport to this embassy in a prepaid return envelope, it took them forever to process my application. They ended up sending my documents back after 4 weeks with a statement that I did not pay $31.40 for the VAC fee!!! I did not get any notification before I apply!!!</text>

Horrible!! Horrible!! Horrible!!
Worst embassy in the world I have ever dealt with,

Visa processing time as mentioned on their website is 27 days
They have taken all the documents and complete fees but even after 65 days there is no update provided

I have sent them 20 e-mail, 10 faxes and left 10 voice mail, but nobody bothers to reply to any medium of communication.

This embassy has set new heights of unprofessional. I would give them -1 star< /review>

The automated message says to press 1 to speak to an agent. When I press 1 it automatically disconnects the line. Yes, it was on a working day at a time their office is open.<//text>

<review>An absolute disgrace of a service. No help whatsoever, the security guard sat on the front desk had more interest in speaking to his mom on the phone instead of helping me. Dispite working times showing 8:30am - 4:30pm there was nobody there other than the security guy.< /review>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) They are very badly educated. If you call by phone, you only get to see if you are Canadian. Canada has it all automated and nothing is personal. A system disaster.

(Translated by Google) I'm a bit biased but I think our embassy has by far the best service for citizens of any embassy in Los Angeles. I was in the worst situation you could ever imagine & they provide me with some Outstanding service ... I could never thank you enough madame: CHANTAL YOU'RE THE BEST !!! THANK YOU sooo much !!!!!

It always warms my heart to express myself from my country, Canada, but I have to admit that the Canadian embassy is probably the best in town (Los Angeles). I was in a terrible, desperate situation, but the service I received from my fellow citizens was simply exceptional. Madame CHANTAL I have no words to show my gratitude to you thank you once again!

(Original)
I'm a bit biased but I think our embassy has by far the best service for citizens of any embassy in Los Angeles. I was in the worst situation you could ever imagine &  they provide me with some  Outstanding service... I could never thank you enough madame : CHANTAL  YOU'RE THE BEST!!! THANK YOU sooo much!!!!!

Ca me fait toujours chaud au coeur de m'exprimer de mon pays le Canada mais force d'admetre que l'ambassade  Canadienne et probablemente la meilleure en ville (los angeles). J'etais dans une situation horrible, desesperante , mais le service que j'ai recu par mes concitoyens etait tout simplement exceptionnel. Madame CHANTAL j'ai aucun mot pour demontrer  ma gratitude  envers vous  merci encore une fois!</review>

Dont eat any food here unless it is pre packaged fresh unless you want to contract botulism and die.
Just a warning. This really goes for all gas stations in general employees dont care.

Just saying dont risk it. Watch what you eat.</Review>

Great place to get C. Botulism.  I can’t believe you didn’t get shut down for that.  According to the report, you were using expired cheese sauce.  Not cool.</text>

Very friendly staff there it's a small station with good parking.  I told em God bless and they smiled. They kept me from running out of gas miles from another station. They do their best to help you.  Don't be mean to them they are doing the best they can.</text>

<text>The only gas station for miles, make sure you come in before sundown, they'll be closed and you'll be stranded. Has snacks, booze, beer & refreshments. Also handy things like scented oils and cigarettes.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Dr Johnson is the best. very few of staff are polite or professional. the nurse practitioner is VERY unprofessional  and rude. always think everyone's looking for pain medication and has nerve to reprimand me like she's my mother. I believe she takes more drugs than anyone I know.  I will NEVER be disrespected by that thing again.< /Review>

disappointing to hear about other people’s experiences with this clinic, but during the three times I’ve gone there I had tolerable wait times and excellent care. Each of the two nurses who have drawn my blood did so pain free and effortlessly, something I tend to have an issue with. One employee in particular (not sure on her exact title) Karen was very caring and personable with me, she has the exact type of personality and empathy for this line of work and this clinic is lucky to have her.<//review>

My 10month old son went in because he had a fever. They said to wait in the lobby, make us wait an hour then end up telling us they don’t feel confident dealing with a toddler. Seriously???? They could of mentioned that when we first got there so we could find another place. Ridiculous!!!!</text>

I was there right at 8 am when they were supposed to be open and the girls got there late . There was a M.A who was so rude ! She was short with her words and you can tell she hates her job. She didn’t want to help me and I had to keep my cool on telling her something. I asked her name before I left and she said her name was “Jess” .</text>

Dr Boyd Johnson is the owner and one of the best Doctors that I have ever had. The only problem with this clinic is that you have to wait. The reason is because he takes time with each patient. I've had to wait as much as an hour to see him! Captain Stan< /review>

Karen Villanueva prescribed me a medication that I'm allergic to. I found out at my pharmacy that I should have not been prescribed the medication. I mentioned it while being checked on, and the nurse also wrote it down. I am disappointed that she didn't check. As a doctor she should take allergies more seriously. When I called the office to let them know about my situation I was told that I was not allergic to the medication, but I am .I will be switching providers asap!</text>

<time>1522672353175<//time><rate>5</rate><text>I just recently became a patient at this office and have been very satisfied to the point where i made Dr. Boyd Johnson my primary doctor he is the best, the wait time is a little long but its due to the fact that he actually takes his time to listen to you and talk with you about whatever the problem is. The staff has been very pleasant and helpful every time i have gone there as well. I would rather wait awhile and have great service and be treated like a person than to have quick service and be rushed through the visit like cattle. I totally recommend this office to anyone looking for good healthcare.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80952f2e8ce56a01:0xbda8ea5031c4a615<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<Text>Had a great experience. My 85 year old out of town mother needed a refill on her maintenance meds. From the nice reception staff at the window to being called for vitals check by staff and being seen by NP was super quick and fast and efficient. NP  Sandhu was super helpful and knowledgeable and caring to my mother. She knew exactly the meds and what they are for and why. Thank you Karmjit! Appreciate you all! Be patient if they are super busy.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>My son was seen here yesterday for a unidentified lesion that was growing in size rapidly over the course of a few days. The doctor who attended brushed it off and said it’s just a blister - keep in clean, dry, and put a bandaid on it. Then asked if we wanted the visit to just be cancelled or written off so there’d be no charge for it.

He was taken to his dad’s primary care doctor today and diagnosed with a contagious bacterial infection. Not only will my son never be coming there again, neither will I and it won’t be somewhere I recommend to anyone. Highly disappointing experience. I’m just thankful we thought to get a second opinion.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< time>

I was a walk-in with no appointment, hardly waited before seeing someone. They were wonderful. I was traveling and needed new RX written. They spoke with me, looked at and copied my Medical Records I had with, wrote my Rx and I was on my way. They are friendly and very professional. I highly recommend them.< /review>

<text>Do NOT go here!! My first clue should have been when i called to make an appointment and the receptionist said that if I am on any pain meds they will not prescribe them for me as if i was some kind of druggie. I said that I am not on any drugs like that so I guess that shouldn't be a problem. I have never ever been asked anything like that from anywhere else. I made the appointment anyway even though I thought it was a strange thing to say to a prospective new patient. I should have turned around when I saw all of the junkies out front sweeping the sidewalk with a fake broom. I went inside the building and everything was telling me to not go here. I got my paperwork started and after I finished it I brought it back up gave it to the receptionist, looked around again and told her to cancel my appointment because this is NOT the place for me. Even going through the paperwork I was thinking something doesn't seem right, it as if the place is geared towards working with drug addicts. SOMETHING is NOT right about this place.

<date>1461786963516</date><Review>I called to refill a prescription that was from a visit 9 days ago, was told that it couldn't be refilled without an additional visit, and they would be charging me for the additional visit. I reluctantly agreed and the nurse practitioner I spoke with advised me to be in at noon the following day. I asked if u would be able to be seen and leave within the hour, as it would be on my lunch break, of which she said yes, I would. I arrived at 12:05 pm, apparently without an appointment because the NP neglected to tell me that appointments can not be made to see her, waited 45 minutes to be brought in a room so the nurse can not take any readings and tell me I was brought in so they can make a referral.

Point being, they plan to charge me for not conducting any medical practice, nor even to see a doctor or NP, and refer me to another clinic which is unnecessary with the medical plan I had. Do not waste your time coming to this clinic. If they were looking to help instead of just get my money, they would have actually had a doctor see me.<//Review><user_name>Jen McGuire< /user_name><userid>103217072960819273347<//userid>< pics>

If I could give negative stars I would. The most imcompetint and rude facility I have ever encountered.the staff especially the woman that goes by "Z" at the front desk are disrespectful, rude in every way, condescending and do not know what the heck they are doing. And the PA's need to go back to school for both the medical aspect but the bedside manner as well. Plus don't ever go if you have something planned within the 2-3 hours following cuz yoully still be in the waiting room waiting to be seen</Review>

Your better off going some where else to actually be seen by a doctor. This place make's you wait way to long even if you have an appointment, they don't even do any kind of check ups here, they just sit there & talk to you when you could of just stayed home & kept doing what you were doing. Plus it is way to expensive! I don't recommend this place to anyone!<//review>

<Text>I came here a couple times like a regular patient, what a disaster. Long waiting times, then u don't see a Dr, you get to see a nurse practitioner who pretends to play Dr. I swore to never come back. Then I got injured at work and had to go back to this same lame clinic, beacuse it was the one assigned by the company. If I thought it was bad before, holy jesus, this time they took the first price in incompetence and customer service. They lost my chart twice, whenever they got results back from the lab or x-rays, they never called me to let me know they got them. I had to be on top of them all the time, even like that they managed to screw things up. If you have another choice, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place is a coin toss. If you can get Boyd Johnson, an excellent D.O., then you will be fine. But too often you will end up with Pattie Rhoades, who is a third-rate nurse practitioner. Rhoades can treat the symptoms, but she can't find the cause to save her life. I spent two days in the hospital after she missed what any competent NP or PA would have diagnosed.

They have low prices, but you get what you pay for. There are many urgent care clinics in Visalia that have superior NPs and PAs than this place does. Do yourself a favor and go there.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is a good place because if you do not have an appointment they will still take care of you. One day I was a flu mum and they gave me 2 injections and soon I recover.

On Saturday we went in and it was packed in that tiny little enclosed space. Completely unacceptable. Merely putting floor stickers on the floor reminding people to social distance is not enough, management should have incorporated a maximum person in store capacity and enforced it. No one was social distancing, there was no room to do so due to all the people in the room.<//review>

I liked it because they give deals on their app. I like to try their new flavors in which they rolled out stranger things.  The service was friendly and patient with customers.  It was two ladies but they did a good job taking care of the long line of ice cream.</Review>

I've never been big on B&R to begin with, but we decided to try this location out today. It was very small and cramped. Wish there was a lot more space for seating and ordering. That being said my 2 year old loved the ice cream, not that she's hard to please in that regard. My grandma hated it on the other hand, while my mother seemed happy enough. I'd just stick with Cold Stone or better yet just buying ice cream from a grocery store. 🤷🏾‍♀️< /Text>

There may be 3 people working behind the counter, but only 1 person helps customers. This slows down the sales process. Ice cream is good, but on the expensive side.< /Review>

I love that there are still ice cream shops around.  They have a great selection of ice cream and also make personalized cakes.  They also have some pre-made cakes as well that you can just grab and go if you're in a hurry.  The primary issue with this place is the prices! I think a small cup of ice cream cost $7.  I'm pretty sure I can buy a pint or more for that price from a grocery store.  I'd still rather come here to get an ice cream cake though, those are the best!< /text>

Good ice cream, not too roomy, pretty crowded when we were there, but a good time was had by all.</Review>

Yummy! I ordered the double scoop mint n chip and very berry strawberry and got my Free Waffle cone! Abby was really nice and helpful there were a few customers and both the girls there worked well together and took care of us well. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have some type of brownie icecream besides the sundae. There still is a good selection of flavors, and I'd much rather go here then the DQ up street, it's horrible at that DQ on redlands Blvd!< /Review>

Ordered star wars cake 39.99 the young lady on the phone said they could draw vador on top instead we got all blue cake with white dots and happy birthday in the middle. I'm sure the cake taste good but the service and  misleading. I give them a two. Pick a different location.<//review>

<user_id>113730986152314353836</user_id><text>I usually go to this Baskin-Robbins when I need me some Baskin-Robbins, and I never thought to post a review one way or the other. But, having now been in a number of other BR establishments culminating in Mocha Cappuccino Blast With Armpit, I can definitively say this is the cleanest BR of them all, with excellent service and lovely employees. I did not realize what I was taking for granted before, but now I do, and I'm positively delighted that this BR is the closest one to me. A truly wonderful example of excellent service and, most importantly, spotlessly clean hygiene. Oh, and the owner (or maybe the co-owner or owner's wife, I'm not 100% which of them actually owns it) is a gem of a woman. <3< /text><date>1524031850521</date></record></dataset><record>

I love ice cream. What I love most about Baskin-robbins is the 31 flavors I get to choose from. This BK has been in Redlands as long as I can remember. The employees are always friendly, and the service is top notch. There is very little seating inside (4 two-person tables) but there are at least 8 benches, with shade, on the corner outside. By far, my favorite flavor is World Class Chocolate. It combines a milk chocolate and white chocolate ice cream into an incredible creamy creation. If you are ever in downtown Redlands and you need a cool treat, head on over to 31 flavors and get your fill of fabulous ice cream. As always, your mileage may vary!</Text>

<text>Always a Joy, they updated this store and redid the tile back-splash with Subway Tile. Looks really nice, fresh and new. I had stopped by over christmas for some gift cards and the wall I just mentioned was being torn down from the old full wall menu and pics of product... I wa curious of the new design. I'm impressed..... Daiquiri Ice is always the required flavor to get once there.</text><user_name>Jeffrey Dean Beaudion</user_name>< user_id>

I got a double scoop cup of chocolate fudge ice cream and as I was eating it there were little clearish-white slivers of what looked like coconuts and they claimed that they didn't know what it was. we then got a refund and left because of the unknown "add-ins" in the chocolate fudge ice cream.<//Review>

Horrible service. My son's were next to be served, short Asian lady ignored them, and helped other people instead. I told her my kids were next in line, she ignored again. I then left, called, to speak to owner, a woman by the name of Nina, picked up and said, she was manager, and that she was there. It turns out that the lady that ignored us was the owner Nina! You can keep your ice cream I'm going somewhere else.<//review>

I don't understand why a place that serves one thing, ice cream, would be this dirty. Why would anyone stand in a line for dirty ice cream? And I understand that young kids need work experience, but hiring brain dead high schoolers may not be the best for business. If you're gonna do that at least hire the airheads who are nice and easy on the eyes. After 3 minutes in this store I had to leave and I'll never be back. Just like everything else in this pretentious town it's only pretty on the surface, when you look past the facade you see the ugly.<//review>

I keep giving this location a chance but the staff is always rude or just seem like they hate their job. Took a trip today 20 mins before they closed (gf cravings) and the female employee claimed they were closed, with attitude ofcourse. Disappointing.</review>

<text>I had gotten some desert for myself at market night and the kids wanted iced cream so we came here, but the girl was very pushy that I leave because I had "outside food" and wouldn't serve me until I took it out. Was I supposed to have my 3 year old stand outside with my food while I buy them iced cream?<//text>< pics>

This is one of my all- time favorite Mexican food spots, and I eat A LOT of tacos!  I love the ground beef the most.   Shredded before it's amazing as well.   My husband swears by the machacado tacos.   They have hands down the best michalada!<//Text>

The breakfast here is awesome. The portions are huge. Everything is super hot and made to order. The best part is the hand made tortillas. It's steps away from the beach too. Definitely check them out for the most authentic mexican food in HB</review>

<resp>None<//resp><text>Fantastic tacos (had the shredded chicken and shredded beef). The shredded beef taco was the winner. Also had one shredded chicken and one shredded beef taquito, with guacamole which were good. The chips and home made salsa were delicious. The service by CJ and Pablo were wonderful. Loved it with the Mexican coke and the hot sauce. The side of fried jalepenos was a nice touch!<//text>< UserId.>

This is the spot for Mexican downtown. It doesn’t get better than this for authentic family cooking. Been eating here for over 20 years and have never been disappointed. Pete’s is definitely one of my family’s favorite. Enjoy.</Text>

<review>We lived in HB for a decade and never tried it until we were told they have the best Carnitas.  My wife loves real carnitas that are fried and crunchy.  Exactly perfect!!
The chips are whole extra thin crispy tortillas fried up fresh.
Salsa Is great and you can eat outdoors even with Covid.
They serve beer as is a must for a mexican restaurant. This will be my go to restaurant for mexican food!!</review><gmap_id>0x80dd2143e7cab2cf:0xeaabb26e18fc7690</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Be very careful with this stablishment, when you go and buy food here if youre not light skin clearly says on a sign , wear a mask or face covering , i saw a light skin person go inside with out either didnt say anything to him but when i tried to go i side to buy something without a mask or face covering the guy at the register starting to give me a hard time , very discriminating!!!!!</text>

We visited Huntington Beach and were craving Mexican Food. We decided to try Pete's and we were all impressed. Food was authentic and delicious. I got the rolled tacos and boy were they meaty. My husband got their Torta... it was Huge and was delicious too!! I recommended this place to everyone and we will surely be back.  Thank you Pete's.< /text>

Pete’s Mexican Food in HB, sorry not worthy of a picture 😔. Just had the shredded beef taco dinner,sad,sad,sad. Simply uninspired! The beef had no character or real flavor.     Salsa was also a disappointment, thin no body just meh 😒.
Then came an equally uninspired taco de papa, I swear they took a hash brown from McD’s mashed it up a tiny bit threw in some chopped iceberg and shredded cheese.
Pass on this one folks, your better off off going to Tacos El Tapatio in Lakewood or SuperMex. 😑😔😑</Review>

<text>Pete’s is our go to place in HB for authentic, well made and seriously flavorful Mexican food. Their carnitas is simply amazing. The sauce on their enchiladas and chile relleno is a perfect blend of smoky sweet. The chips are always hot and crunchy and served with a salsa that is always fresh. The best part is that the staff are always friendly and ready to offer suggestions to satisfy your current cravings!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

The food was absolutely delicious, the service was great and the pricing was spot on.  Hands down, one of the best Mexican breakfast I’ve ever had!</text>< time>

Was here with my BF Isaac and Gary...Very authentic food...had a carnitas torta. And fresh birote and the carnitas were fresh and crunchy. The tostadas chips and salsa were very addictive. Highly recommended this restaurant for a bite!< /Text>

Favorites on the menu: chili con queso(add ground beef,) beef hard tacos, chicken quesadillas (ask for extra cheese,) chipotle pasta, and of course any of the burritos! Any request will be met with a smile and a pleasant response to do what is asked.</Review>

Terrible. Could not express enough. I asked the woman working at the front, "What is in the deluxe burrito?" She continued to tell me the type of meat they had available. I repeated the question 4 times several different ways, same answer. Ended up ordering a carne asada burrito, no sour cream please. The gentleman in the back whipped it up. Meat is tasty, only thing there was half a pound of sour cream on the burrito. I go to the counter and ask for a replacement, where the gentleman says which one did i get. I said carne asade. He says that the carne asada burrito doesnt come with sour cream....😔 You let me down Pete's, in every way service could have. Wont be trying again, please avoid the tourist trap at all costs.<//Text>

Kind of a greasy spoon restaurant. Food is good, prices are good for the area. I eat here pretty often and love it.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Service to go friendly. But MOST BLAND Mexican food I ever had.  Tried Burrito. Chicken fresh but felt like I could have made at home. Guacamole more like a condiment than any avocado in it. No flavor. Even salsa bland and no calente.

Not sure if I will try again. Maybe for breakfast.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Placed an order for three meals all of which came  incorrect even though receipt says the correct contents for the order. Food for "bigger plate" was missing for two which means we paid for more than what we received. One meal had an order with peanuts, the customer is highly allergic to peanuts. It seems as though they paid no attention to the order and just put food in a box. Is this typical of Panda Express to do such a bad job? I’d be careful if you’re not dining in to physically watch them fill the order and not screw up.</Text>< Name>

Great food but they make door dashers and online order pickup wait outside in the hot sun for long stretches without even checking in with you.</Text>

I eat here all the time! Love it! I just need someone to show me how to order teriyaki sauce from here because it’s impossible apparently. I even ordered teriyaki chicken and didn’t get any sauce on it or on the side. Dry chicken and burnt rice for dinner, still kinda good 🤷🏼‍♀️< /Review>

With Covid protocols in place you may find yourself standing in line but it's worth the wait. Love their chowmein and orange chicken. If your in the mood for American Chinese try them out.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Did a takeout order during our Corona quarantine. I tried to do a phone-in order and the automated system said all orders had to be submitted online. I went ahead and created an account, selected the time I wanted the food ready, and submitted my order. I entered my order at 5:00 for a 6:00 pickup time. I arrived about 7 minutes early because I was coming from another place in town. I decided to go in, figuring that they would simply prepare the order while I waited. Instead, the food was already in a bag, waiting for me. This doesn't necessarily have to be bad, but I discovered when I got home that the food was just tepid. I makes me think that they bagged the food as soon as the order came in and set it off to the side rather than preparing it right before a 6:00 pickup time. I have no idea how long my food sat out. This is not a good thing.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

No refund for my drink and when I suggested a bottle option she said no and gave me a look like I was trying to take advantage. I needed tea and they brew that fresh so it needs ice or its warm/room temperature. Worst part is the guy behind me also got a drink so then we were both screwed. When I told her she needed to tell people in line she snapped back and said she was. Not that guy though... all in all she was not helpful and just was like... sucks to need ice.<//text>< Pics>

Terrible service. Online order. Waiting over 30mins just to have the Manager on duty asking me for a confirmation email multiple times when I had the confirmation number in hand for her to find my order. Took her multiple times and delay my order until she actually "found it". Ended up being an incomplete order after and had to wait a bit longer before getting the rest of it. Online ordering here is trash.</text>

I think on Friday evenings, all of Hollister comes here to eat.  But the staff are top notch, and the waits are trivial, if ever.<//review>

Nothing against the food, it's good, and the employees have always been polite from what I've witnessed. I'm also happy that this place is still so flipping busy. My rating is because they fail to smoothly run this store, and I witnessed a health violation. I ordered online for the first time, and I won't be doing it ever again. Food was to be ready by 7:10, so I show up at 7:12...waited over 10 minutes to talk with an associate who grabbed my order that had been sitting there since before I arrived. There were also 2 other people who ordered online waiting before me who had to wait just as long as I did. No associates asked us if we needed help, nor was there a designated online orders associate (there desperately needed to be one with a line out the door). While waiting I witnessed an associate at a cooking station drop a giant plastic bin lid on the ground. No big deal, put it in the sink, wash your hands and go back to work...NOPE. A fellow associate picked it up, placed it on a work surface, and continued to handle food...I'm just happy that my order didn't get messed up. No utensils though. I will happily never come to this location ever again.<//review>

<Review>The food is good for what it is. No it's not authentic.  But it's fast food, let's be realistic.  The service is friendly,  the food is hot and conned properly and they try to move as fast as they can.  Only four stars because they tend to run understaffed,  so the line really backs up,  indicative of how good the food is.</Review><Time>1512415444472</Time>< rating>

I have put up with the slow service without much compliant, Going in at 9:15 pm to a restaurant that doesn't quit serving until 10:00 pm standing in line for five minutes and when several others get in line they come up with we are not cooking anymore this is at 9:25 pm so the decision had been made before 9:15 pm not to cook anymore. So all you could get was line left overs. All I know is I want spend anymore of my money here it should be some customer services so you cook smaller portions until 9:45 pm are put it on your website and signs that you quit cooking at 9:15 pm so people understand that all they are getting is going to be leftovers.<//Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><text>2.5 stars, I suppose. It's hit and miss with both service and quality of food. Mostly it's the service. Compared to other Panda Express locations throughout the South Bay, the standards are low.

The other day, my wife watched an employee drop one of our meals on the floor. The kid who dropped it was about to pick it up and keep serving, but another employee saw my wife watching him. It wasn't until that point that he was told to remake it.

The food. Well, YOU have to be the one to decide if you're going to eat what's available. They'll leave stuff on the steamer all day if no one orders it, so it's buyer beware. Pretty easy to tell either way. No matter what you order, rest assured the servers will do something dumb, like give you egg rolls with no sweet and sour sauce.< /text>< Pictures>

Steam table food served cafeteria style. Food was okay, but bland in my opinion. I was disappointed as it was very busy. Did not meet expectations for quality or freshness.< /text>

The food is good, what you would expect from a Panda restaurant. However, the people working the line are too slow. They need better training of the food servers to move things along.</Review>

<text>If you've grown up eating Cantonese Chinese food you will definitely be disappointed. Panda Express is the Taco Bell of Chinese food. Vegetables are not crisp, items sit too long on the steamer trays. I thought it's one redeeming quality would be that it's one of the few places in Hollister that serve after 9 p.m. but it only serves leftovers after 9 p.m. . Smaller individual portions on The Late Night menu would go far in this town. I don't eat there anymore after three tries but I would if the late-night menu was fresher. Hope they listen to their customers.....< /text></record></dataset><record>

Expensive. Go to the Chinese restaurant across the street, it's better!

They need to stop being so cheap, they want to charge you a lot for reheated food.

They should turn it into a buffet, $10 and you get anything you want. Then it would be better<//Text>

< Review>
The workers in Hollister need to go and take notes from the Gilroy Pandas. There so slow in Hollister and people always have to wait for a new batch of food to be cooked because they run out of what they have on the line.< /Review>

<review>Awful.  My wife just came back.  She asked for sweet and sour pork and the woman their said very snarky "we don't have any pork products."  On top of that they've chosen not to include any type of meat in their chow-mien or rice.  Worst Panda Express EVER.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Tables were not very clean either... Only reason to eat here is if you are avoiding McDonald's and Burger King... They also didn't have a lot of the menu items here.</Review>< Name>

The owner and staff are so friendly and helpful, the menu is very diverse with something very everyone. The soup is homemade, it was fresh and very tasty. Had the tuna melt, which was perfectly seasoned, the bread grilled to perfection. The deserts are homemade and are fantastic. Had the lemon bar, one of the best I have had. I encourage you to stop by if you like good home cooked food. Oh and the breakfast is the best in town!</Text><rate>5< /rate>< userid>

< Review>
Lido Cafe and Bakery has been in the neighborhood  a long time! Shawna has moved into a bigger space with sole focus on the restaurant. The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch, and offers a dinner menu  Wednesday thru Sunday. Check the website for specifics. My family enjoyed Easter brunch at Lido and we were quite happy with our meal. We ordered Strawberry French Toast,  Country Fried Steak and a Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich. Everything was very tasty! The service staff looked great and was very attentive! Our server, Gustavo,  was GREAT! There is a bakery display of beautiful pastries that greets you as you arrive. You'll be full when you leave, so order them to take home!< /Review>

< Review>
Quaint Cafe with a "neighborhood" feel to it.   Friendly service without the hovering.  Menu offers options from basic breakfast dishes as well as Benedicts, chicken and waffles , French toast or  lunch items like burgers, sandwiches, and soups and salad-  They even have options for your four legged friend 🐶. Dine on the patio or indoors. Beverage menu has teas, coffee,  mimosas even Italian Sodas. 😋 or just come for their dessert 🍨 cheesecake,  thumbprint cookies,  muffins and more.
Family atmosphere - mid level pricing about 10 to 13 a plate<//Review>

<response>None<//response><review>We stumbled upon Lido Cafe in our search for a bakery to kill time between doctor appointments, and I am happy to have landed there. Because of the outdoor seating for covid, we wound up ordering a full breakfast to share instead of just muffins. We shared a 2x2x2, with French toast, eggs and sausage,  and were not disappointed.  There were 4 large slabs of French toast, two 4-inch sausage patties, and 2 eggs poached to perfection. I was happy we split the meal because we were both stuffed. Service was excellent. I finally discovered the pastry counter when I went inside to use the restroom, and will have to explore that further on the next visit.</review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

One of the best brunch spots in the Sacramento area.  Great family owned cafe with amazing food, drinks and baked goods.  I've never had a bad experience over the 4 years I've been a patron.< /text>

A nice little breakfast/ brunch spot in Fair Oaks. Good place to eat with friends or family.  Think of Denny's-esque with an alcohol selection.< /review>

<Text>I called in an order today 1/10/21 for take out. When I arrived, I was very disappointed to see that there was not only outside dining but inside as well, openly defying the state orders closing restaurants for inside and outside dining. There weren't any indoor tables removed to allow for some modicum of social distancing and people were sitting at the bar. I will not return to this local favorite but instead will only support those restaurants following orders.</Text>< pics>

By far the best cafe in town! The food is so delicious, and you can tell it’s made with fresh ingredients and not a lot of grease. It’s like Black Bear Diner, but better in every way. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Prices are low and the portion size is just right. Cannot recommend this place more, it’s perfect.< /Review>

First, the owner of the restaurant is amazing!  She really cares about her restaurant, her employees, and her customers.  If something goes wrong, she wants to make it right. She wants everyone to be happy, enjoy their food, enjoy your service and come back again and again.

Second, the food is scrumpdillyicious!!  Worth every penny.  They have a full bar and patio seating.  They're did friendly (patio seating only), and even have items on the menu for your fur buddy.

I love the Prime Rib French dip and the Reuben sandwich on sourdough. Yum, yum, yum!<//text>

<Text>Got takeout from here and saw that they aren't following any safety measures for covid-19. Food is always good and I feel for restaurants hurting right now, but there are plenty of other restaurants that are keeping safety in mind that deserve business instead of this place. I'll also be reporting them to the public health department.<//Text><user_id>108940502839734101799</user_id><date>1609709232872</date>< gmapID>

When we first walked in you had an immediate sense of family. It is a darling cozy place. The wait staff was very attentive. The couple we were with knew the owner and she came over to greet us which made it very special. The menu has much to choose from. The bakery items are out of this world! Very very yummy! Prices are quite reasonable and the portions are generous. Lots of locals here. This is a must stop place when in the area.</review>

Food was excellent!! Service was on point..For a crowded space (Sunday 11am)it felt very comfortable. I'm 6' 4" and I felt like I had plenty of room. I was there for breakfast and it was done perfectly! You get a chance stop by and enjoy!< /Text>

Breakfast burrito was small and had this giant glob of cheese on top of it. No salsa or anything just plain and kind of dry.

The potatoes were soggy and undercooked.</review>

IF I COULD 4.5 STARS!!!!!! ^-^

I came to this cafe and I was greeted with a warm smile and I loved their hospitality, especially Shauna! She handled and tended to my needs whenever she had the time, especially when I was the only guest while everyone else came in as parties of two or more.  The food was amazing, I ordered the Early Bird Sandwhich and their tropical ice tea. This place does get busy and being tucked in to the side tables, close to the entrance where everyone waits does ruin my experience for a bit. Have PATIENCE, UNDERSTANDING, and the food and the service WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT for this local business. Come on by and make sure to find Shawna & say Hi to her. :)
p.s.
The sandwhich was amazing and soft and crispy and i love how the cheese just melts on my mouth! GOOD JOB CHIEF! ;)<//text>

This is one of my favorite restaurants, especially for their breakfast. This is no longer the hidden gem it used to be, so plan ahead and leave a little extra time- the wait will be worth it. Enjoy!</review>

I’m in town for Christmas to visit my family, which includes my sick grandfather. We were very excited to have a nice breakfast with our family and enjoy time together. I was unpleasantly surprised when they tried to rush us out to “seat more people”. Management almost stood over our table while we were eating and tried to make it better by bringing a baked good. It did nothing. I am more that upset by our experience.</Text>

One of our fave breakfast places in the greater Sacramento area. Try the chicken apple sausage or their Seafood omelette. Gets crowded, but worth the wait! They even allow you to bring your dog and sit outside together. And you can order breakfast for your pooch!!!< /review>

They ran out of the normal bread they use for French toast and had to use sourdough bread as a substitute. Very crowded.

Very bad experience Saturday by seating staff.  We are patrons of Lidos as well as other family and friends.  Always referring customers and friends as well.
Will not happen after experience of Saturday. Our daughter made reservations for 13 people at 10:30.
Before 11am remaining group was seated and ready too order  Hostess came to the table and informed us we were taking too long and need to get orders in.  Our family was together with there father who is ill and had planned a special breakfast with him before some had to catch flight. The hostess hovered over our table and commented on our way out " thank your little family for cominng in". I wish my husband and I had walked out when we had arrived early and the hostess started making comments.
Her one comment was"if I don't keep customers moving I will here about it.
Reservation at 10:30 and left before 12.
Read Madeline Sullivan comment.
This was our granddaughters experience.</text>

<review>Lido is a local favorite and it’s run by Shawna who has handled the place with grace and care for decades. The food is terrific and the service is incredible, everyone is really pleasant. It’s busy but usually you can eat outside in the between times. I love this place and if it’s not crazy hectic, I will take my mom who is nuts about the eggs Benedict.</review><name>Reiny OdumZane< /name>< user_id>

Can be super busy for brunch. My soccer team descended on this place after a few indoor games. We needed to refuel! We ordered Bloody Mary's and mimosas from the bar while we waited for our table. They offer good, traditional food, breakfast/lunch fare: huge cinnamon rolls, burgers, sandwiches, waffles... lots of options. I had the Fair Oaks burger with a cinnamon roll as an app - next time I'll try the biscuits and gravy. If my friends had not shown me this place in Carmichael, I would have never noticed it or known about it at all.</Text>

Not sure if the burger buns here are just not to my liking or if mine was stale.  It was pretty hard on top and it wasn't from being toasted.  It was also very dry.  The inside of the burger was pretty good so unfortunate that the bun was so disappointing.  The rest of my family ordered other things and they all liked their dishes.

Still giving 3 stars since the inside of the burger was good and the service was friendly and the server came back to check on us often.< /Review>

The Domino grilled sandwich is excellent. Grilled turkey, grilled mushrooms, Swiss cheese, lettuce and red onion on sourdough. Only problem was the bottom slice of bread got soggy. Had the chili with cheese and onions. Really good too. Coming back in the winter for a big bowl full! Haven't tried the baked goods yet.<//review>

Small family owned neighborhood cafe with awesome ambiance and that small town feel. Excellent service and food! I had the Marty Cristo (like monte cristo but not deep fried) and my friend had the meatball sandwhich. We left full and leftovers for lunch the next day. Will definitely return.< /Review>

Awesome breakfast place. My sister seemed to really enjoy her Florentine Benedict. My Seafood Omelette was certainly delicious. The potatoes on the side were a really nice ratio of soft to crispy though they need more flavor. The biscuit was okay. The Omelette itself was good with a nice amount of flavor. It really helped that the chef wasn't stingy and put enough shrimp into it that I had a shrimp in every bite. The veggies in it didn't overwhelm the omelette. The Hollandaise Sauce was delicious and complemented the dish nicely. Overall, it's a pretty good spot for a breakfast.< /review>

<UserId.>112860659171385699763< /UserId.><review>Since my wife and I moved to Carmichael Lidos has become our go-to spot for breakfast on the weekends and the occasional weeknight dinner. The service is truly great. Visiting Lidos feels like visiting family. The food is always on point. Their corn beef hash, chicken and waffles, steak and eggs are all great for breakfast and brunch. They also make a mean bloody Mary. For dinner, their meatloaf or ahi tuna salad rocks! I haven't had anything I haven't enjoyed. I actually try different things on the menu because I trust that whatever I order will satisfy and Lidos has yet to disappoint.<//review>< Response>

My wife and I went to dinner at Lido on a Friday night and could not have been more disappointed.  I really wanted to like this restaurant, as it is locally owned and operated, visually charming, clean and it serves throughout the day.  Both the service and the food were poor.  I ordered a beer, but the server returned to tell me it was one of several they don’t have, although they are printed on the menu.  My wife asked for a different sauce on her order; the server returned to tell us it couldn’t be done.  We were brought our appetizer without utensils or plates, we had to ask for those.  Each of our entrees was made incorrectly, mine did not contain the meat I ordered and my wife’s was made so improperly that it had to be started over again.  At no time were we offered anything to make up for the errors, and at no time did any manager, etc. visit our table.  The server, upon presenting the bill, indicated that we hadn’t been charged for two small items, totaling $5, on a $50 bill.  That was the extent of the apology for the poor meals.  Ordinarily I would have asked for a manager, but we had guests and we were on a schedule, and needed to leave.  I can get better food and equal or better service at dozens of walk-up or family style restaurants, we won’t be back to Lido.</text>

the food here is consistently good, and the service is always friendly. the orders come out hot and quick, with superior coffee that is refilled for free. I live right down the street, and am relieved that there's a dependable breakfast diner within walking distance!< /Text>

<Review>Nice little cafe, good food and service. They have acoustic music some weeekends and that's always a plus in my book. They have great looking homemade items in the bakery display case but I haven't sampled many, I always have a pretty good experience when I visit this establishment.</Review>< Gmap_id>

I went with a regular of Litos and the service was speedy and the cuisine is so good. We had mocha's while we sat and spoke to one another. The mocha was like I was sitting in Spain, in the most serene Cafe in the rural town, it is so authentic. I had the chili Verde and it was amazing. I will return with my own family soon.<//Text>

<text>I LOVE this place. Great staff and insanely good food. My absolute favorite place to eat. <3

Edit- I've been looking at all of the negative reviews and I simply do not see that people are so disappointed and angry with this restaurant, it's employees, and the owner. My mom has been going there since the 90's, and She has been taking me since I was a kid. A restaurant has to be good if my mom and I keep coming back (along with my Sister and Brother, who have also been going there since they were kids). Anyways, I was reading them out loud to my mother and we have been wondering why. I would give this restaurant 10 stars if I could!</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x809ade9d6f28a63f:0xf3090268898b0e39< /GmapID></record>

Never had to wait very long to be seated, even at a peak time (helps that I've only been here in a group of 2 or 3). Everything we've ordered has been absolutely delicious. They are very kind and understanding about doing substitutions. Once I had ordered an omelet with a side pancake and the server suggested I get the pancake subbed for the toast that comes with the omelet to save money. Little things like that are what keeps repeat customers. If you like espresso, their espresso is pretty good...that's coming from a coffee snob! All the staff I've interacted with have been kind and efficient. I live in South Sac so it's almost a half hour drive...but totally worth it!</Review><user_name>Taina Freire< /user_name></record>

Best cafe in town!  Great wait staff and food is the best.  It's just a lovely place to go with family or friends, outside tables for pets and with a pets menu!< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I placed an order with Lido Cafe through Postmates. When my Postmate arrived she was informed by the owner that they do not accept Postmates deliveries. Odd, because the restaurant accepted my order. I called the restaurant and was informed that the menu items that were listed online were not actually available. I asked what was actually available on their menu, and the supposed owner became very rude. She said she was doing me a favor and that she didn't have time to go over the menu with me, that I needed to already know what was on the menu. Please tell me how a customer can know that YOUR menu that YOU posted online is depicted inaccurately? I asked about the price difference in substituting items since their menu was depicted differently online, and she said "You know what, I'm cancelling your order, you can deal with someone else. I have a line out the door and don't have time for this". Then she hung up! I have never experienced anything so wildly inappropriate before in my life. I would never order from this restaurant, in person or otherwise ever again. Customer service isn't "doing your customers a favor". This woman should be grateful for any customers at all with her disgusting attitude.< /text><time>1558286467505<//time>< Resp>

<Text>The Best food & so dog friendly! So pleasant eating outside with our pup. He loved the chicken served in a frisbee he gets to keep & a big bowl of ice water. The vege omelette was superb & the eggs Benedict as well.  Bloody Mary set the whole thing off. Service excellent! Perfect early mother's day 🤩</Text>< pictures>

This place is AMAZING. We recently quit going to iHop (bad service) so we decided to try this place out! For what we usually get at iHop we got here for half the price and they serve breakfast till 3 pm?? I recommend this place to everyone because we can't believe such an amazing place exists! High quality service, amazing and friendly staff, delicious home made food!<//Review>

This is one of my favorite places to go! Shawna (the owner) is very friendly and treats you like family. The food and service here is excellent and the new location gives Shawna the room to display all her baked goods which is something she has always wanted to do. I cannot say enough good things about this place!<//review>

My Lido Cafe experiences (I am a neighborhood regular) are ALWAYS pleasant and enjoyable (as well as always delicious)! The wait staff members are also always super friendly and attentive; they are very efficient too!!< /Text>

We went there at 7:45pm on Sat. There were perhaps 8 other diners in the restuarant,  plus us. Dinner salads are small and skimpy, as if there is a lettuce shortage or perhaps they believe lettuce is the price of gold. There were only 8-10 small chopped pieces of tomato and 4 croutons. This, to me, is a clear sign they are trying to make more money by giving you less. They also have a policy of giving out only 6oz. of fries with their meals. We went there with a gift certificate, but I won't be going back to spend my own money.
How is this place still in business? In my opinion, I must be more discerning.<//review>

Carmichael desperately needs a good cafe, but this is not it. Inconsistent in both service and quality.
And for all you big tippers out there, Shawna keeps the tips those kids work so hard to earn. She can legally do this by serving the occasional order. I've lived in this community for twenty years and will eat at Denny's before stepping foot in Lido's. It deserves no stars.</text>

Carmichael desperately needs a good cafe, but this is not it. Inconsistent in both service and quality.
And for all you big tippers out there, Shawna keeps the tips those kids work so hard to earn. She can legally do this by serving the occasional order. I've lived in this community for twenty years and will eat at Denny's before stepping foot in Lido's. It deserves no stars.</text>

<Text>Lido Cafe puts milk in their scrambled eggs for some reason.  I had to request them without milk as I am badly allergic to dairy.  If you are also allergic, be aware of this.  Otherwise, this is a nice spot to get a meal.< /Text>< pics>

I save my 5 stars for when i am completly blown away by service, taste, and overall experiance. With that said theu have great food, fresh, tasty. Friendly service. Great atmosphere. I have been going to Lido since the first setup shop sharing a wall with a hair salon over 15 years ago. They continue to improve and i continue to be a regular</Review>

<review>They hate and will charge you for extra plate if you plan to share a meal, don't try to get the manager involved cause she was the one who told us next time I will charge you for extra plate. I don't eat a lot so  this was my first and last time there she was  rude as well< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>This place doesn't feel as homey since they moved down the street, but the food is still great! If you live in Carmichael, I highly suggest trying out this breakfast joint at least once.< /Text>< pics>

We had to kill sone time waiting for some work  to done on my jeep.
We walked inside.. No greetings. Three woman walking around in our vicinity mind you. The place was busy but not crazy. I was looked at by two of the staff and looked away. No smiles. No acknowledgment.  So we just left.we Had no idea what the wait was. And didn't feel welcome. No thanks.
We went outside to get girl scout cookies.  So  a woman came out and said "we have a table ready when you are.."

No thanks isaid. Its rude customer service that will drive me away.< /text>

<text>9/27/2014 Went for breakfast.  Ordered eggs over medium, they were over easy, ordered a toasted English muffin, it was warm, NOT toasted at all, served with country potatoes, they were raw and there was nothing country about them, no onion, no bell pepper, just slices of raw potato.  The bloody mary had great flavor, but doubt they put any vodka, so basically over-priced tomato juice with a celery stick, green bean and olive.  My husband had ham and eggs, the ham seemed like packaged shaved ham.  Nothing like the old location, which we used to go to frequently.  Not worth $30 cost.  Won't be going back to this new location. Sorry guys, but sometimes moving to a bigger location is not always better.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Truthfully- I'm picky
I've waited to see if the service, food and atmosphere would change and we've been there about 10 times, and each time it's been awesome.
There have been mess ups w the order, but nothing they weren't willing to take care of ASAP and with a smile.
*** Make sure your whole party is there, bcz they won't seat y'all until then.< /Text>< gmap_id>

This morning after waiting nearly an hour for our food we were informed that our waiter had forgotten to turn our order in. Because the restaurant was full, we choose to leave rather than start all over.<//text>

Kitchen wasn't very clean. They need to focus more on cleaning than food prep. Unclean place is a nasty restaurant.</Review>

WOW!  Not too sure where some of these people were eating.  First off, let me be completely honest, the first time my party ate at the NEW Lido café location, the service was NOT GOOD - and I expressed it to the owner, Shawna, (sidenote - the food was FANTASTIC).  Shawna's response?  Apologized sincerely and more than made it up to me and my party.  And I was pleased to discover the server had been coached up and was providing excellent service to ALL patrons!  I respect the server for digging deep and growing.  I also respect Shawna for caring so much - would have been a lot easier for her to just terminate the server.  Now, back to the food - YUM!  Pick ANYTHING - eggs benedict, Marty Cristo, (their twisted version), grilled cheese, best damn chili cheese dog, juicy burgers - pick ANYTHING!  Don't get me started on the dessert case!  YES!  Carmichael does have a wonderful, delicious, locally owned and operated café - LIDO CAFE!  Don't miss out!< /Text>
