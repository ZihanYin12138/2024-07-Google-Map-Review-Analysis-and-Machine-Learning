<Text>We had Roland come out and did a complete diagnostic on my Daughters car.  It turned out to be more than he worked on.  I will use Wrench from now on for all my car issues  I highly recommend them.  From the beginning making the appointment to the end of the service was great.

<Time>1572024124411</Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I hired a Wrench tech to do a simple oil change in May before I moved across the country from GA to CA. Halfway through the road trip in CO, my check engine light came on and the car lost a vast amount of power (error code = drivetrain malfunction). After driving drastically below the speed limit for the remainder of the trip, I took my car to a BMW dealership in CA where they shared some really trouble diagnostics. The results "shocked" the BMW techs; the oil hadn't been changed "in a very very long time", resulting in a "crunched together" filter - driven by using aftermarket filters. They also discovered significant sludge build up. In everyday jargon, my engine was effectively destroyed.

When I mentioned that I'd had my oil changed by a Wrench tech in May, I received this response from the BMW techs: "Two things may have happened: Either someone has changed the oil but not the filter for the oil several times, or someone said he changed the oil but actually just reset the light without doing any work."

I shared this with Wrench on September 24th via email and included photos of the engine + oil filter, a written diagnostic from certified BMW techs and receipts detailing the work allegedly done by the Wrench tech in May. I have yet to receive an email back from Wrench, a month later. I'd hoped to resolve the issue offline, without need for public commentary, but I did not receive a response to my email.

I have taken steps to pursue legal action, and am sharing this post widely in the hopes of saving another person (and their car) from the same fate.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlT3Z-Q44GTLci1ZVUP1ZXBeApc3XZwzfKI4DU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIHSVwZZtvCjhEjmDkFIpmGiMXAxhPffueC8bl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ6Gz2nSzW7n_OjCSg1IFdRhnNjupC4nSIPI4P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwzyX25OnyxCUQhF5QdjKsukgihnYebAVY_hnj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZt2-ELWONJfKSkdhX_fLQZLpujByF04bLbAok=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNheFWVXS5hl_KBdilNYjEOAJgqLc5q42zIuPf6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>{'time': 1572040600308, 'text': 'Hi Kaleigh, thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback.

I had a battery malfunction a couple weeks later and was stuck on the side of the freeway. They hooked it up wrong somehow. I called and asked if they could help they said yes, on Tuesday. So I guess I was expected to not have a working car for 4 days.

End result, I had to pay someone else to do the job correctly on the side of the road. 1 star service, 1 star customer service.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>I highly recommend Wrench Mobile Mechanics!  Kevin, who took the initial call was patient and informative.   He set me up with a  next day service appointment.   Arron, the mechanic, was thorough and personable.  He  had my Van back up and running in no time (literally 2 hours).  I  will certainly use them again.    A very happy customer indeed!<//text>< Pictures>

Wrech is an amazing company their Sacramento Tech Rene performed a transmission high pressure line and power steering line replacement in my mother's Chevy Uplander.

Everyone was friendly from the person who took the appointment to the mechanic. My car had been sitting for 3 years which was not a problem for the mechanic. He gave accurate advice and was on time for the diagnostic and also for the repair. I paid less than quoted always a plus, especial when I checked my local repair shops and the price was fairly equal to what they were going to charge for same repair. I couldn’t be happier with their service. Haven’t had such great service in a long time!!< /review>

<text>Made an appointment and after the near 30 minute phone call they literally called back 3 minutes later and cancelled my appointment. Tried pushing me out nearly a week. But after talking with many other mobile mechanic companies I ultimately took the new appointment. Fair pricing will update after work is completed. Worth the wait. Mechanic was excellent. Best mobile mechanic service in Sacramento area.</text>< pics>

< review>
Finding Wrench yesterday was a life saver for me. I had to work at night and my car was having electrical problems due to the battery leaking acid and causing all kinds of glitches. The car wouldn’t start. Wrench send me an excellent mechanic, Tiffany, to my driveway. She was pleasant, extremely knowledgeable and very efficient. She got my car running in no time. Affordable realistic prices, excellent customer service, no fuss, no tow trucks, no uber back and forth from a car shop. I will be using nobody else for my vehicle work from now on. Thank you so very much for your great service!<//review>

I LOVE WRENCH! This mobile mechanic site is the greatest! No towing to shop. I made an appointment online and the next day, Roland, my tech, was here earlier than the appointment time. His expertise was so welcomed. He was experienced and told me (every step of the way) what had happened to my truck! He is so genuine! WRENCH HAS MY BUSINESS FROM NOW ON! Thank you, Wrench, and, THANK YOU ROLAND!< /Review>

This place has people on the phone that don’t know what they are talking about I was quoted one thing then when I called back the next day to do it they where saying it was going to like 200 more than what was quoted then when I ask why and to speak with someone they said whoever i talked to did not add some services and if I wanted it for the price quoted it would be a rushed poor job!< /Text>

The service I received was absolutely fantastic and the mechanic (Ethan Elliott) was extremely professional, courteous and efficient.  He installed my brakes in under an hour and had me back on the road!!? I woll definitely recommend your service and will use your service for future repairs!!!! Thank you so much!!!!

<text>I love visiting here with friends because we can mess around for awhile and play games. I love the coin pushers that they've added! I love the DDR machine and The House Of The Dead shooter! My only problem is I think that sometimes the prices for the games can be a bit high so we'd have to refill the card if we play a particularly high game like one of the shooters. But aside from that it's a fun place to kill some time!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Review>It is definitely bigger than the one in my hometown. Has a lot of games but it still feels like it lacks variety. All the while, an arcade is an arcade and it surely serves it's purpose of entertaining the public. A cool place to bring the children and let them unwind for a bit.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>This place has some really fun arcade games and plenty of crane games if that is what you are into. I love that they have the Initial D arcade machine but I honestly dont play it anymore.

<review>Took my 4 year old granddaughter, there wasn't much for her to do there. For older kids/teens/adults this place is great but very expensive! The days of using  tokens are long gone, everything (including ticket tallies for prizes) is done by card and some of the games use the equivalent of $4 per game!</review><Resp>{'time': 1574285747255, 'text': 'We appreciate the feedback Tami.'}<//Resp></record>

This arcade in the Tracy mall I would say is ok...the games have definitely improved since the last time I went in a few years back, however it is very expensive to play there and $50 was gone in like 30 minutes. They do have game packages but only for video games.  It would be nice for them to have like a happy hour or offer coupons<//review>

< Review>
This arcade SCAMS YOU. My daughter played the Wheel Of Fortune and hit 500 twice and when I brought the tickets up to turn them in the cashier said there was only seven hundred tickets. And after we counted them by hand there was only 700. There should have been 1,000 + tickets. So if you play the machines there make sure you count the winning tickets because they Are aware that they are not giving out the right amount of tickets. They are 100% aware of this.< /Review>

No more coins! You can use cards that tilt provides to play games. They revamped the place, looks great.<//review>

Family friendly but a little basic. Don't come expecting to get good prizes from your tickets unless you're lucky. Some games give less tickets then what's fair (Skee-Ball for example) and yeah. Just enjoy this place for fun and your tokens will be worth it (don't expect to get good prizes unless you're spending a lot or saved up tickets for months).</text>

I had a great experience at this location. It was my 1st time here and it did not disappoint. I have never been to a ShareTea before and was pleasantly surprise with the many options of drink. They had milk-teas, smoothies, and even mojitos. The mojitos are virgin, they just make it have a mojito "flavoring."

One of my favorite things about this place is that they have milk alternatives. I have lactose intolerance and I am so glad that I can get almond/soy milk in my boba instead of suffering from a post-boba stomach-ache. I ordered a Wintermelon Milk Tea with boba, herb jelly, and almond milk. I got light ice and 30% sweetness. It was one of the best Wintermelon drink that I have tasted, and I will go back for sure!

The service was friendly and they had great COVID-19 precautions. They had the glass and only allowing 5 people inside at once. After ordering the drink, you have to wait outside to wait for your number to be called. If you do not like that, just order online for pick-up.< /Text>

I loved the mango mojito. Lime mojito was sour even with 100% sweetness. Okinawa milk tea was good.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Finally a boba place in lake forest! Wow couldn’t be happier. The boba itself is so soft and chewy and perfect. They have a decent amount of options for the drink portion. Missing my favorite (lychee slush) but that’s ok lol. Still tasted ahhhmazzingg!! 🤤🤤🤤 only one size cups though, which - meh. What if I want a smaller option... but that’s ok. You can pick sweet and nice portions. And they have a stamp card so you can go more 😂😂.< /Text>< pictures>

I told them that I wanted regular ice and semi sweet  in my boba drink but what I got was a few cubes of ice and nothing but a sugar drink. Waste of money and time being in line and waiting in my drink. My boba was room temperature. It wasn't even cold because how little ice was in it. Not worth it. Not coming back. Rather spend my money at a different boba place.< /review>

In town visiting family and was SO excited to see Sharetea open in Lake Forest! The staff was super friendly and the drinks delicious, such a great variety on the menu. I've already been twice, this is definitely going to become a frequently visited spot. It is already so popular the wait on my second visit was pretty long, hoping for an order ahead/pickup option as they get settled in.<//Text>

Located in a very easy to access area (pengo is too far away) I come here regularly for a drink. Drinks are very good quality, reasonably priced, and staff is friendly.

Edit: I came in and ordered, my order never got printed, waited 15 mins to find out my order didn't exist. So I waited even further. I was hoping to keep getting good service but I guess not :/< /Review>

Their Oolong milk tea was tasty - not too sugary, even at normal levels of sweetness. The boba tasted fresh, but wasn't as delicious as Sunright or some other shops I've frequented before.

My friend ordered a peach tea at half sweetness as most places make their fruit teas undrinkably sweet, but she said she'd probably try 75% sweetness next time around.<//Review>< pictures>

Years ago I stopped going here cause they didn't change the oil filter and when I asked why they said they did but my frahm was still on my vehicle even though they used only pennzoil at that time.
I was in a rush this past weekend after working 7 days a week, thought I'd give them another chance on my wife's mercedes. Big mistake. Now the hood sensor keeps flashing even though I've closed the hood a thousand times.</Text>

Driven down the road in one of my best SS's- hit the brakes and a picture frame i had in front seat breaks! Pulled into jiffy parking lot- greeted by an employee- no sweat, they let me take care of mishap & garbage dispose. That is a positive business attribute- thanks jiff- sure to do business sometime soon!< /Review>

I’m extremely unsatisfied with Jiffy lube!I was referred here so I took my car in for a simple oil change and now my AC isn’t working at all. I went back to let them know what happened and they had no sympathy at all, couldn’t even check under the hood or anything. They simply said we don’t work on AC’s. I’ll never go back here again!<//Text>

Took my Corolla in for an oil change as a first time customer. There was another customer saying he had been there for two hours for a tire rotation and an oil change. I ignored it thinking his was a special situation but gave him the benefit of the doubt because there were only two cars in the shop: mine and his. Then it took them 40 minutes to tell me they can do no better than $90 for just an oil change. I asked if they can do anything besides synthetic oil and they told me no. They didn't get my business. Called pep boys right after and they gave me a wide range of options for oils and got me set up with an appointment. Even the toyota dealer said they would charge me $55. Not coming here again.< /Text>

Went in to change my brakes and get new rotors. Craig and John were very respectful the entire time. Other issues were found with my car as they worked on it but they were detailed and in depth about what they found, the causes, and what they were going to do to rectify the issues, which nowhere I've been before has anyone been so detailed and thorough to me. They've definitely made it my go to place when I need anything for my car. Thanks you two, I really appreciate it!</Review>

I went in for a standard oil change and was told an amount higher than what I’m used to and I asked to confirm that it was for conventional oil since it was high and the guy with the manager jacket confirmed that was. I looked at the receipt when I got home and realized he charged me for Signature synthetic oil. Who knows what actually got put in.<//Review>

Needed an oil change and I was helped as soon as I pulled up. Craig, Jesus, and Daniel took great care of my truck. The service was done in a timely manner. To my surprise they went above and beyond my expectations.  I previously had a bad experience at a different jiffy lube but these guys really know what they are doing and we're super friendly. I'm definitely going back for my next oil change even though I don't live in the area ☺</review>

<Review>Used to like this place, but the last time I went the job was not done very well. I decided to save a few dollars and do my own oil change. Upon getting under my vehicle the seal was not completely on. The oil seal was not securely on. It came off right as I touched the oil seal. The was oil all over the undercarriage of my vehicle and when I drained the oil it wasn't even enough to fill a milk jug. My oil filter appeared to be used since it was printed as a reusable filter with hand writing all over it. (I'm fairly sure my receipt showed I payed for a new one. The job was done very sloppy. I'm going to be doing my own oil change for now on.<//Review>< Resp>

So I took my vehicle to this location to get my brakes done.  When I arrived, I was greeted by a technician that told me to take a seat, and he would get back to me about 30 minutes later a female came and took my information and stated the cost of my breaks which included the charge to replace my wheel locks because I lost my key. The technician came to me and said that he needs to take my vehicle "down" the street because he did not have the correct tool to remove the lock. 20 minutes went by, 30 minutes went by, 40 minutes went by; I was starting to get worried. I asked another technician if he knew where the other guy went he said he didn't know and he would call him. So, he called him and he said that he was 30 minutes away. I said tell that guy to bring my vehicle back NOW! As the guy arrived, I asked where did you go! He claimed he went down the street, but they didn't have the tool. I was pissed, so I left! I went over to American Tires to see if they can remove my wheel lock a technician came to me and said sir, "didnt we already tell you that we cant remove your wheel lock." I said, "No I have never been here' then he said, but your truck was." He gave me a recommendation to a place that can remove my wheel lock. I immediately went to that location. Once my wheel lock was removed, I went to Brake Depot to get new breaks. The technician at break deport said, sir, "If you are here about removing your wheel locks again, we already said that we cant do it." I told the technician at break depot that I have never been here. The technician at break depot said well your vehicle was. I realized that the technician at this location Jiffy Lube drove my vehicle to varies places throughout Riverside trying to get my wheel lock removed vice just telling me that it couldn't be done. Very unprofessional!<//Text>< Response>

Good/fast service; staff is great.

Prices are outrageous though... just under $110 for full synthetic. I looked up prices on Amazon (while in the waiting room), and found the exact same oil (6 quarts) for under $50 (including shipping), and that's not even discounted bulk rates. Mark-ups are required to run a business, but this is ultimately price gouging. Look for coupons online.< /text>

I noticed this morning that my car was very low on oil and this Jiffy Lube is right around the corner from my house.  I stopped there it was like 6:50 am and Anthony came out to greet me.  The shop doesn't open until 7 am but Anthony was great he opened up early for me and was just really very nice and professional. I told him I was concerned because I was very low with my oil and I had to get to work but was afraid with it being that low.  He reassured me that it would be ok. He noticed that my blinker was out and he fixed that for me, put in the quart of oil and answered all my questions.  I explained to him that I had lost my husband and that he always took care of this for me.  Anthony told me if I get my next oil change done there that I can stop by any time and it is free to get my fluids check and topped off.  Very nice young man, very friendly, courteous  and professional.  I will be back there to get my oil changed there as soon as I can and I recommend this place to all woman who need little things like this done where you can trust someone.  Thank you Anthony for your help<//text>

<text>I went here because i needed an inspection done and was only in the area a day so I hadnt bothered booking an appointment elsewhere. They told me my tires and brakes were bad along with a light out. I was fairly perplexed given that all the tires were less than 2 years old and I'd looked at them prior to coming in. And there was certainly no apparent issue with the brakes. There was a light out but it wasnt any important light needed for inspection. Brought it to another place the next day highlighting to the mechanic the things that were apparently wrong.he looked it over and said everything was fine. He brought me over and explained when things should be looked at over the coming year. But there was no reason my car shoudnt pass inspection. Thank god I'd brought it elsewhere rather than pay for the BS repairs here.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I won't go back here. I brought in my new Nissan Altima for an oil change a little before 5k miles. I had brought my other Nissans here for the past few years and was always able to get a conventional oil change for less than $50. The guy tells me it will be over $100 because my vehicle "must have" full synthetic oil, that they "could not use anything other than the full synthetic." What choice did I have? I didn't know any better, so I agreed to it. Fast-forward another 5k miles and it's time for another oil change. I went to the dealership for a 10k check up and asked them about the full synthetic oil thing. I was told that, while full synthetic had its advantages, it wasn't a necessity; the vehicle can use conventional oil.

The guys at this Jiffy Lube lied and took advantage of me because I didn't know any better. I'm angry about this and will be reporting them to their corporate offices and the better Business Bureau. It's completely unacceptable.</Text>

<review>I was charged $100 for an oil change. I have never paid more than $30-40 for an oil change in my entire life. They told me my car “required” a specific oil and that’s why it cost so much which is robbery. Waited over an hour for completion of service $41 for labor?

<review>Overall a good experience. They of course tried to upsell me on a few things that i know are not necessary, but i guess that is the way these places stay in business and competitive. The rep i dealt with (i believe Mike) was very nice and understanding when i said i dont feel that is needed. Fast service. Will repeat<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>I looked up jiffy lube prices online to which I decided to drop off my truck.  They call me 10 min later and advise me that my truck needed repairs which I ssvisrd them I only needed the synthetic oil change. They wanted to charge me almost a hundred dollars! I advised the young lady on the phone what I had found online and she told me it must of been for s different store.  I just looked up the information again and it clearly states $59.99. Totakku felt ripped off!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>Went in with a $5 off coupon. When my daughter went to pay they wouldn't honor it because my truck had a factory skidplate. REALLY?? Tried to reason with manager and said I had several cars right behind that one to be done. Didn't matter. Took rest of my cars  to GT Import service station on Hole right after leaving Jiffy and they had a rate LOWER than Jiffy's coupon rate! Guess what? They don't charge to take off a factory skidplate when they change the oil. No one else I called (Valvoline Service Station) does either for that matter. Jiffy - you lost my 5 cars at least 2 x's a year. I tried to warn you that would happen!
Funny, not too many others below this comment have had a positive experience either. Wonder why........</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I took my car here for service & was treated like a queen they went way above the call of service to make me happy I had different services done. If you want to feel special & know you are getting a great deal go talk to Jesse he will explain everything in detail & he is honest & professional. If he dont think you need it he's not going to tell you to get it.
I feel bad I don't remember the name of the guy that did the work on my car but when he was done he made sure he took me to my car & walked me thur everything he did showing me everything all fuild levels.
Thank you guys for taking care of my car as if ut was yours....

Tacos are really great. Reasonably priced and stuffed with meat. I'm usually a pretty big eater and found that three were enough for dinner. They have several meat options beyond just steak, chicken, carnitas. The al pastor was very good, maybe could be a little juicier and spicier. The carnitas was excellent, crispy and had some additional seasoning that I haven't encountered on carnitas before. They make their own horchata--it's not overly sweet or heavy like you often trying. Great place to sit outside and enjoy a beer in nice weather.</review>

<Text>I only just found this restuarant recently and it's already my #1 favorite Mexican restaurant to go to. The staff is freind and the food is amazing. I love the 2 mixed meats they do of chorizo with asada. They just go really well together in a burrito. The restaurant is small though so getting a table wont be to easy. The aesthetic is simple a couple picture frames on the wall but its nice.</Text><GmapID>0x8084173a122d07a5:0xadfb2a4954c4a4d6</GmapID>< Name>

<Review>First time I came here. Called in a burrito, they said 10 minutes. Showed up 15 minutes later, paid, and waited another 15 minutes while multiple other customers placed orders in person and then left with their food. The burrito was good in the end at least.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Took a while to order and get the food because it is a popular place  especially with the locals.  But the food was worth the wait!  Their carne asada was really good. The burritos are large!  Generous portions for the price.<//Text>

Great chips and salsa. The carne asada tacos I had were probably some of the best tacos I've had in a while. They were delicious. The meat was perfectly cooked. My boyfriend's burrito was great as well. It's a small little restaurant that many may not choose to go to, but it is so well worth it. It's also cheap, so it's an even better deal.< /text>

You will always see work'n blokes chowing down on large plates of this delicious food to fuel them through the second half of their day.  I love going here when I'm positively hungry.   I like their horchata.  It isn't wimpy like it is in other Mexican places.  No draft beer here.  Just bottles.  The best IPA is Lagunitas.  The service here is also very good.   Salsas are solid.  I have never been disappointed.   I see the Mexican customers ordering the shrimp cocktails all the time, so they must be good.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x8084173a122d07a5:0xadfb2a4954c4a4d6<//GmapID></record>

Delicious in every way.  Super generous portions.  Chips that aren't greasy at all and a smoky and a tangy option for salsas that are both very good.<//Review>

<Text>Best burrito place in Healdsburg, probably in Sonoma County! Almost everything they make is traditionally hand made from family recipes passed down from the old generation, but twisted just enough to fit "California Mexican" food while maintaining authenticity (but it's not a yuppie place at all).  Try the chicken fajita burrito. It's awesome! They also have some great veggie options, like the Burrito Guadalajara, which is not billed as vegan, but is simply delicious food that just HAPPENS to be vegan  (probably... I mean, at least it says on the menu it has no dairy or meat). I'm not a vegan, but I do appreciate scrumptious, healthy food...  and the Guadalajara burrito delivers!  The main thing that sets it apart is that this burrito has some nice veggies in it instead of just being a "regular burrito" with no meat (like most veggie burritos), so it's extra good!! Prices are still reasonable (especially for Healdsburg), staff is friendly, food comes out fast, place is clean, has a nice mural on one wall.  I highly recommend it, especially for burritos, but also for the rest of their food!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>It was my first time going.  I asked for refried beans in my burrito. Their refried beans are mixed with whole beans which I  personally can't stand.  I was super hungry but ate only half my burrito and left it there. Secondly, the chips in their picture look very homemade. They serve chips out of a bag. Totally NOT homemade!  The picture was extremely deceiving lol. Also ordered guacamole which had 0 flavor so I had to add salt to wake it up. Everything I ate has a weird aftertaste and was a Huge disappointment!! I read reviews first too and that's what made me want to try it. I won't be back and won't recommend this place to friends either. If you are looking for a bland taste and a big disappointment then defenetlly this is the right restraunt for you!!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Never been there before. Reuben was the person there to help me and he did a 5 star job for $2.30 (cost of the bubble envelope)

I saw how low their rating was and wanted to share this good experience.

Everyone seems to go out of their way to complain but not so much when it all goes better than expected

Thank you Reuben!< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>This review is for Bobby and the crew at this store. Lately, I have noticed a big improvement with this store's customer service and wait time. After chatting with Bobby, I came to found out that this store is under new management and servicing changes have been made. The "can do" attitude and sense of urgency to get customers safely in and out is utterly even more important in the midst of this pandemic. Kudos to this amazing team!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<review>Very rude people. Everytime I ask for help, no one was helping. I used their computer for like 8 mins (I had my stopwatch set up) and the guy charge me for 3.00 twice. Be aware of what they are charging you because they add extra. I live in hickey blvd but I still drive to ups westborough (even same ownership) but the people there are way much much nicer! Excellent customer service in ups wesrborough unlike un ups hickey! -zero star for this branch!< /review>< date>

** Under new management!

As of October 2018, Bobby and Mohit (you may have seen them at the Westborough UPS Store) are running the place and it's a much better experience than before. They are super friendly and the location is not as busy (yet), so I was able to ship my package very quickly.< /Review>

BEWARE! RIP OFF! These Indian guys are a joke! They wanted to charge me $3.00 for 1 single page in black and white!!! Since THEY printed it using a computer, and that’s the cost of using it even though I didn’t even touched it, but only sent an email with my file attached. Of course they didn’t mention that before, No way I was going to pay that.</review>

It was going to cost me nearly $30 to return something via UPS here.  $6 for the box, $16.99 just to pack it, then an additional $5 to print out the return label. 25¢ per minute is fair but a $5 minimum is absurd. This experience was simply ridiculous. It's like they are trying to scare customers away. Go to another UPS. I did.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>The owner is very rude. He thinks because he knows everything he assumes so does all the customers.

I went to this store to ship a 9 lb comforter to Idaho. I am thinking that the price possibly cannot be more than $15 -$20 to ship this one item. To my horror I paid $92 ! This place lost a ups customer for life. I also will contact the corporate office to inform them of the extreme and utterly ridiculous price of which I and others had to pay at this store. Something needs to be done in this matter!<//review>

I think UPS is an expensive solution, but I have always had my packages arrive on time or early and never damaged.  Also, it is nice you can just bring an unpackaged item and they will pack it for you, though there is a $10 custom pack fee.</Text>

I don't know if it's only me or it's the same for everybody. The Indian was extremely hostile to me. Once I returned a package. I put the label into a label bag and handed it to him. He said to me rudely, "this is drop off only!" and asked me to tear off the sticker. I was pissed off.
The other day, I also went there for drop off. I didn't tape the box I was going to return. Then, the Indian old guy asked me to buy the tape from him. I said other UPS can do that for free. He again said, "I don't know about others, here you need to buy tape." I was mad again.

Friends, the only suggestion I have is never waste your time going there. Avoid at any cose. And for the Indian guy, go fxxk yourself.< /Review>

UPDATE JAN 2019
I gave this location another shot, mainly because the new franchise owners are thoughtful enough to go through all of the hate mail on GMaps. If they care enough to do that, then they certainly care more about customer service than the previous operators. Confirmed by my trip today. Upgrading to 5/5 to help a small business out.

-------------------
Dropped off a package here the other day and - can confirm that there's a certain gentleman who works here and could be described as "rude". Maybe something got lost in translation.

Hey, my package got where it was supposed to go, so I can't complain too much.< /Text>

Wow. I thought I'd give this place a chance and I should have listened to the reviews. The "gentleman" does not listen, isn't aware of how UPS works  and keeps saying he's a private business, he's pushy and tries to charge you for the strangest things, hostile, and sliiiiighty misogynist (I really don't like to throw that word around).

Anyway, pass if you have questions or issues. If you just need to drop things off and leave, this place is suitable enough. Otherwise, pass.< /Review>

Yes, all the reviews are true. The man is very rude...! Let me politely begin! Went to the store around 2:00pm, there was one person ahead of me in line while one person was already being helped. It is now 2:15 and I am still waiting in the same spot. The lady who was being helped by the Indian man, was getting quite impatient as it seemed he didn't know what he was talking about. The customer had a question about when her package was set to arrive to it's location. The man rudely said, "IT WILL GET THERE, WHEN IT GET'S THERE" in an almost shouting tone. The rest of us in the line were shocked to how he responded to her question. They were going back and forth for another 5 minutes figuring out the details when the line started growing. I needed to just drop off a package and be on my way. When he noticed the length of the line when he just told me to leave the package on the counter. I called the store several hours later and asked if my package went through, since I simply left it on the counter and didn't get a receipt, and again with such a tone said "if you left a package here, it is not in my hands, so idk where it is".... I am going to pray my package gets to where it needs to go!!! Please don't go here!!!!</Text>

Very bad experience!! The guy there was rude and knows nothing. I have some important documents to be delivered at San Francisco but they came back to me so I tried again but 2nd time also they came back to me. My docs never got delivered and I have to then use FedEx. I asked the guy so many times to tell me if I am missing something but they just took the money for delivery and the docs were never delivered. Wastage of time money. Never go to this place!!</Text>

Drop off a package today, I received worst service! The Indian customer service works over there, is extremely rude! Don't go there if you can.
I drove 20 mins from work during lunch break to drop off a package. Because it's drop off so I didn't bring my wallet. When I get there I found out the box isn't sealed. So I asked whether I could have 1 inch or shorter tape. However, the Indian guy work over there said I must pay for 1 dollar for that, otherwise, I need to come back later.  Another customer also came over drop off stuff. He is so generous gave me 1 dollar without asking. I appreciate a lot. But the Indian customer service was so ridiculous, he also angry at that customer helped me out because he gave me 1 dollar. Extremely bad service!</Review>

He won't give up an inch of tape,  whereas all other UPS and Fedex stores will tape a box as courtesy.  He hides the UPS envelopes behind the counter and plays dumb about their very existence in the hopes of selling you a Manila envelope.   The very epitome of nickel and dime. Urgh.< /review>

Do not, I repeat, do not leave your packages here to be dropped off. They can only accept 10 packages at a time, so they will instead let the package sit at the customer service center on Forbes Boulevard. The customer service is terrible, the one person who works here speaks very poorly, and is not helpful.</Text>

<Text>This is my second time and it would be a shame if Oda doesn't get 5 star from me!
This place is super cool and clean. (Yes there are still clean reastaurants in SF). They brew their own beer, bake their own bread and pitas! Food is absolutely delicious! This time I tried their Baked Spinach Dips, Falafel Wrap, Hummus and Smoked Salmon Bruschetta just wow. If you are in San Francisco, and like good food, you should definitely check this place out.

I haven't tried their pizza yet, but usually when the bread is good, pizza is good :)<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>I came here after watching a show at Chase Center. It was really big inside with a good amount of people. They had a pretty big bar. There was a sign to order at the bar, but we ended up being told to just take a seat.

The menu was a bit pricey. My friend ordered the mac and cheese and I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. The mac and cheese was pretty small. The chicken sandwich came with cheese and bacon, as well as a small salad. The chicken was pretty dry, but the salad tasted really good.

I might come back again. It seems like a convenient place, right next to ucsf. The food is pretty expensive for okay food. It seems like a nice place to have a beer and talk with friends.< /Text>< pictures>

Outstanding! I recently visited after seeing my Doctor and they make the best Lattes, They use illy coffee. The pastries are very good and I had one of the best Beignets. The Beignet had caramel fill and it was awesome! I wish I would have bought more. The food here is always delicious as well, it truly is a Great place. I look forward to coming here more than visiting my Doctor next door.<//text>

<review>I dined here last night with 4 of my friends this Turkish food restaurant with Georgian flair for the first time. We tried several appetizers and dishes from the menu and I have to say with unanimous approval from everyone at the table every bite was delicious. It’s a mother daughter restaurant, got to chat with the daughter and hear her story a bit, very nice people that definitely know how to cook. I would make a kind suggestion for wait staff to pay more attention to attentiveness and guest accommodation but the bussser I believe his name was Dmytro definitely made up for the dent in the waitress service. We will be back very soon.< /review><gmap_id>0x808f7fcde1e68101:0x39ef30d491a027ed< /gmap_id><username>Miro Didyk< /username>< response>

I wanted a place I could walk to from the cancer ward at UCSF Mission Bay. Upon checking the menu a few days ago from my home in Eureka, I've been obsessed with trying the Pasta Primavera. The last time I really enjoyed PP was in Venice Ca. almost 30 years ago. Oda made my dreams come true! The Pasta Primavera is delightful and delicious! And they only had one variety of wine by the glass in 4 flavors, but the waitress promised me some cab/pinot noir blend from an open bottle and it is superb. If it's only the Old Soul house wine, I'M SORRY I poo-pooed it. It fits the pasta perfectly. I'm having a traumatic experience with my hubby's cancer, but this restaurant has revived me heart and soul! If we must stay another day (hoping to go home tomorrow), I will be back tomorrow for their B.L.A.T!!< /text>

Had to ask for butter or jam on the toast, they looked at me like I was crazy. Served rotten avacado on the breakfast scramble. Potatoes were undercooked. The bacon was very good. They are not place to go to for breakfast.</text>

The food is good and the prices are ok for the most part. The place is clean and well maintained. The musak is just loud enough but not overpowering. Food service was fast, and the presentation was nice. $3USD for a can of Pepsi is excessive though.They do not do custom orders. If it's not on the menu they wont make it IE they have eggs in their breakfasts but wont make a side order of just 2 fried eggs for my kid. The staff wasn't rude but they weren't very friendly either. They came off a bit snooty IMO. I probably wont come here again.<//Text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>I'm sorry I don't usually write reviews, but I have to for this place, to help the owner make some necessary improvements. This place has some great potentials. The owner is really nice, friendly with great customer service, you'd always feel like home if he 's the one personally serving you. His staff on the hand , will only act nice if the owner is around. I've known him and his nephew from Parnassus and I wish he had chosen better staff for this place, someone like them.
I have given this place so many chances and I patiently waited for improvements. It is conveniently located where I work so I was really hoping for improvement.  I don't mind paying the price for convenience and service but unfortunately, not only that its bit pricey, they also have a very POOR customer service.
For instance; my coworker asked for an extra hot sauce and the cashier asked him why do you do need more, we've already made it spicy.
Also this morning, cashier will not say good morning, no smile, really not much interaction, just "can I take your order" she didn't even bother mentioning the change of menu just a week ago. When I called to tell her that my sandwich tasted different from what I usually get.. she said "we encourage all customer to read the menu".. say what?? no sorry, that we didn't mention the change, but will be willing to change it for you. All along I was thinking I'm ordering my regular sandwich. Anyway, I wish they didn't change their menu, the food was already good. If they need to change anything it should be the price and the staff.
Here's my suggestion, coz I'm sure you are paying so me hefty $ for your rent, 1) keep your previous menu and 2) change your staff immediately.. chose wisely because it makes a huge impact to your customer specially coming in the morning for breakfast and your customer will face rudeness so early.. it sets the mood for the day.  I wish you the best.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Not somewhere we’d visit again.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great place to shop for party supplies in large quantity. Always a busy store. The only thing is that it gets crowded and their isles are very narrow.<//Text>

I always go here whenever I'm craving something for my sweet tooth. They have a wide selection of Mexican candies as well some basic household ingredients used in cooking, so it's a one in done deal! Also, for the bulk buys it's great value.< /review>

<username>Itzel Ramirez</username><Text>Initially my experience was great, the person who helped us was very nice and friendly.
We purchased some plastic cups and lids, the person who helped us had opened the bag of cups to make sure the lids fit,all was great. I ended up returning the next day because we didn't end up needing them.
Who i assume was a manager refused to refund one of the items stating they were missing cups. The cups had been left in my car and no one had touched them, that was how they had been given to me when i purchased them, he did offer me store credit but at this point i was upset, left them their cups, will not be shopping here in the future. If you purchase any items make sure they are sealed this was my mistake for trusting the store.<//Text>< pics>

The store has a variety of items. The workers however, are almost always rude and in a bad mood. The cashiers can’t give the correct amount without having an attitude either.</Text>

Greatest store around if you need Mexican Goodies and their prices are Great especially on their piñatas ....Great Coustumer servuce ...must check it out if you haven't yet....the only down side is that when it's busy it does get a little full and their parking is really small but you can also park on the street behind the little shopping center to avoid all the traffic inside the parking lot<//review>

(Translated by Google) Better change your schedules on the page.
I tried to enter at 7.43pm and Seniora Guera told me that it was already closed that I was going to buy a lot.

Put on the web site that they close at that time and not 8pm.

(Original)
Mejor cambien sus horarios en la pagina .
Intente entrar a Las 7.43p.m y me dijo la seniora Guera que ya  estaba cerrado que si Iba a comprar mucho.

Pongan en El web site que cierran a esa hora y no Las 8.pm.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) I bought shoulder meat and when I opened the bag the meat smelled so bad that I ran to the store to return it I wanted to buy it in another store but I no longer had time so I only exchanged it for another one in good condition it is very ugly to lose confidence in a Store especially when you want it to sell your tacos in your business 😟

(Original)
Compre carne de espaldilla y cuando abrí la bolsa la carne olía tan mal que corrí a la tienda a regresarla quería comprarla en otra tienda pero ya no tenía tiempo por lo cual solo la cambié por otra en buenas condiciones es muy feo perder la confianza en una tienda especialmente cuando la quieres para vender tus tacos en tu negocio 😟<//review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) I'm not going to Desir that they do not have everything they have many things, but today I had a bad experience with 3 people who work, and to top it all, no one knows the name of the owner according to them. I went today to see tell me they could change a jelly mold for one of a horse that they have and one of the cashiers designed me to look greasy when I do not even know how to use it as soon as I was last weekend x the yacht full of dust is because they have them hanging because they told me that you can not change asked by the owners and no one knows them and no one knows how they are called seriously you work with someone you do not even know who your bosses are? Please

(Original)
No voy a Desir q no tienen surtido de todo tienen muchas cosas solo q hoy tuve una mala experiencia con 3 personas q trabajan si y para colmo ninguna sabe el nombre de la dueña según ellas. Fui hoy para ver dime podían cambiar un molde de gelatina por uno de un caballito q tienen y una de las cajeras me dise q se miraba grasoso cuando ni siquiera sé a usado apenas fui el fin de semana pasado x el y asta lleno de polvo está porque así los tienen ellos colgados pues me dijeron q no se puede cambiar preguntó por los dueños y nadien los conose y nadien sabe cómo se llaman en serio trabajas con alguien que no sabes ni quienes son tus jefes?

As an El Monte resident, I cannot believe I had not discovered this place before!

The service is adorable! It's family-oriented and has a very homely feeling. If you are a regular, the staff will recognize you and will converse with you about how you're doing, what you're up to, etc.

The food is great for an affordable price. It's a great deal deal here. Probably one of the best breakfast spots in El Monte.

If you're looking for a mom-and-pop joint in this area, I highly recommend this spot!<//Review>

This place is awesome. I love going here when I'm in Chino. Food quality is excellent and the servers are always nice. If you like large portions and country style breakfast then you should check this place out.< /Review>

Love this place!! The atmosphere is very welcoming and I really like how they have a little bit of history on the walls!! (Pictures of El Monte dating back to the early 20th Century) All the employees are nice, attentive and easy going, the restrooms are always clean but most importantly the food is amazing and a great value!! The refried beans are delicious and the food is never over cooked. Will definitely keep coming back! (Try the green chilaquiles🤤😋)< /Text>

<Review>Have been coming to Flo's for over 15 years and the breakfast is always great! I always order the breakfast burrito with nacho cheese and home made salsa on top. This time I opted for French toast which is also very good. Yoli the owner always makes us feel welcomed. The coffee is also delicious!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

So happy that Flo's Coffee Shop is open again! My mom and I came in today and enjoyed lunch on the patio. We shared the brisket breakfast burrito and chicken sliders from the Pop-up. Everyone was socially distanced, the food was perfect, and we felt 100% safe the whole time. So glad to enjoy the coffee/horchata again!</text>

<text>I celebrated my birthday yesterday in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a incredible evening and the place was clearly one of the reasons for that outstanding meeting. The waiters  cooperated in a gorgeous manner, the cooking was great and my friends were extremely  delighted. We shall surely visit again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.<//text><username>Matthew Brown</username><rate>5</rate><UserId.>114289978376233351042< /UserId.>< GmapID>

Flo's is morethan just a coffee shop. It's your mom and pop's diner that serve good breakfast and lunch. I was looking for a go0d diner and ended up here to grab breakfast. I had coffee, a pancake, veggie omelette cheese with potatoes and buttered wheat bread. Their coffee taste good. Similarly, their veggie omelette taste good and of good portion. Pancake and wheat bread were soft, tasty and fluffy. Moreover, their potatoes were fresh and tasty. Staff were amiable, attentive, and professional and competent. Indoor atmosphere was very welcoming and typical mom/pops kinda vibe. Indoor seats were huge. No outdoor seating. Prices are fair and competitive. Ample of parking space. Overall, I highly recommend Flo's and will come back again.<//text>

Very good diner!! The staff is super friendly, when my friend and I stopped here to rest from our bike ride they offered to lock them up with their chain because we had forgot our u-locks. We ordered the French toast combo and the waffle combo and both were delicious and prices were low! Will definitely be returning!</Review>

Was greeted and seated right away. Service was great, entire staff was friendly and it wasn't one waitor to a table, but more like 4 to all tables. Not to mention the food was delicious and brought out fast as well. My family and I definitely recommend it.< /review>

<text>Just recently moved to the area and I was in the mood for a mom and pop type of cafe. I googled and Flo's Coffee Shop popped up. I wasn't sure if it was the same owner as the one in Chino, but I thought I'd give it try.
I ordered the Country Breakfast, eggs over easy, hash browns, biscuits n gravy and a sausage patty, and of course, a cup of Joe.
Everything on my plate was absolutely delicious! The biscuits n gravy were soft, just the way I like them. I definitely recommend Flo's Coffee Shop. I will be coming back again and again.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2d9ff296b84cf:0xb35eaf07ea8baf89<//gmapID><Rating>5< /Rating>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><text>A friend had told me that this was a great place for breakfast, so I thought of it yesterday when Peck Road was closed going north because a dead body had been found. So I had to go south. I also looked it up and it was #3 of 176 restaurants in El Monte. When I got there I thought it was closed because all their blinds were shut. But the sign said OPEN, so I went in. It's not crazy cheap, it's reasonable. I ordered the enchiladas verde with 2 eggs. It comes with either rice and beans or potatoes and beans for $8.95. Delicious. I'll try lunch next time because some of the sandwiches looked quite good. Menu said they come with a side. Parked right in the front of the door.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>One of our favorite places for chicken fried steak, refried beans and eggs.  Yolanda the owner plus many family members welcome you as though to  her own home.  The restaurant is decades in operating and serves many in the community for breakfast and lunch only from 6:30 am -2 pm.  The civil employees frequent Flos restaurant, especially police and fire personnel.  Prices are modest and pictures of historical nature of El Monte California enliven the walls.< /Review>< Date>

Found this restaurant just down the street form where I was staying for the night. Stopped in for what turned out to be a great breakfast and a great price! Most items on menu are only $7.95 or less! Wonderfully pleasant waitress. Great way to start your day!</text>

I went to Flo’s because I wanted some breakfast type food from a non chain restaurant.  Since I was traveling alone I wanted to be around regular people. Locals maybe.  The food was good.  The cooks made great Mexican style egg dishes.  I think I ended up getting chilaquiles and it was everything I expected it to be.  There were a few locals inside.  The lights were dim and it felt like I was at someone’s house having breakfast before  I headed out for a vacation.  It was a nice way to start my day.  Nothing fancy just regular breakfast with regular people.  I’ll probably go back next time I am in the area.<//Review>

I would give it a 4.5 if they had one. The waitresses were friendly and hospitable. The portion sizes were great for their buck. Decent atmosphere and AC. However, a downside is that the room is small and there could be a lot of people. I suggest the owner to take over the empty stores next to it to expand her business.<//Review>

Quick delicious breakfast. This is my second time here. Smaller menu, but what the lack in offering, they more than make up for in quality. I personally had the country breakfast, and was offered thier salsa. Very delicious and spicy, my favorite combo. Biscuits we're fluffy and gravy was rich and delicious. Hash browns are perfectly crispy and eggs were cooked to perfection. The service was prompt and always available, my coffee was never empty. Overall a perfect in and out breakfast experience.  Will be returning.<//text>

Small diner with room for about 40 in a mini mall that is deserted.  Despite this, a good mix of people keep streaming into this little engine that could.  Service was quick.  The older waitress, the owner maybe, kept reminding 2 younger waitresses to be more efficient & attentive.  And this is one of few diners I've ever been to that offers tater tots!< /text>

If you come to Flo's for breakfast your good, nothing to go crazy over. However when it comes to the salads they're just hideous. No effort or thought of making it pleasing to the eye. And forget the burgers(heres a tip) ask them to make you a burger using the ground beef they use for the hamburger patty w/eggs breakfast plate not the frozen discs.< /Text>

Came here for the first time Tues. We had breakfast. Large servings very delicious. My eggs were made exactly the way I wanted them. Pancakes light and fluffy. This will be the first place I think of when I want to have breakfast out. They did expand their dining area to the next door building so there is more room. Everyone was very friendly.</Text>

<text>It was understaffed when we came in for breakfast for the first time and the waitress knew it.  She was an older lady but she was so nice and attentive when she could be and apologetic about the situation.  It happens, you know.

Anyway, we had a group of seven of us.  Our order was taken as quickly as it could be and the food came out quickly.  It was delicious.  Service was excellent and friendly.  The waffles are so yummy, light and crisp.  The Sour Dough French Toast was okay, a little overhyped.  Eating sour dough was not a good mix with the cinnamon sugar for me.

It seems Yelpers were very impressed with the coffee.  Even my group thought it was delicious.  It turned out to be nothing but a canister of Folgers Original.  LMAO!< /text>< Pictures>

<text>When we arrived we waited around 10 minutes. Inside is a cozy little place and it was actually full for a weekday morning (I think). Our waitress kept repeating our order with items we did not even mention/ order. When our food arrived to the table some items where a little on the overcooked/ burned side. The waitress seemed like she changed our order and when I asked she was super rude. Not to mention she didn't bring half the stuff I ordered and gave me something totally different. But it seems like she was doing it to other customers too (we overheard complaints). The food was ok, but a little to pricey for what we received. To make matters worse ugghhh the waitress was trying to charge me for items I never received and duplicates of same items! I came as a group, but once is enough for me :(<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2d9ff296b84cf:0xb35eaf07ea8baf89<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1460754359999</Date><rate>5<//rate><Text>Great hole in the wall breakfast joint. I would say skip Denny's or Ihop and grab some food that Isn't chucked out of the kitchen like some soulless factory. If you're around Saturday or Sunday their menudo is great. A small plate is just under $6 and it was enough and delicious. Next, try their country fried steak with a side of tater tots and a biscuit and gravy. I really don't care for biscuits but I love to dip my tater tots in the gravy and its gooood with 4 o's.  If your just in the mood for some traditional eggs, sausage, bacon, hash-brown, and pancakes then this place  won't let you down. Finally just wanted to add that its one of those places that has been there forever, or at least it seems like that. You'll see the walls covered in pictures of El Monte from the early 1900's. This all just adds to the experience. With great service and great food at the right price what more can you ask for.</Text>< Pictures>

I’ve used wave house cleaning since March of 2021 and they have been amazing. The cleaners are professional and always arrive on time. I love how they are quick, efficient and also follow all necessary protocols with the covid pandemic. Since using their service I have referred them to countless friends and family and not one person have complained. The best thing is the bang for the buck we get due to their affordable prices for stellar cleaning.

I also appreciate their fast customer service response time if I had a hiccup and had to change my schedule for service at the last minute.< /Review>

I've been having Wave clean my home for some time now, and overall the experiences have been good.  The cleaning has been consistently well done, and staff is always friendly and attentive to questions/requests when in your home.

The only real disappointment has been a one-time event; one appointment was missed by over an hour, and I was not able to reach anybody by phone or email to confirm whether the staff still intended to come.  And this is minor, but generally Wave sends two people and the cleaning at my home takes around 90 minutes, and other times it's only one person and takes twice as long, so it's best to keep your schedule flexible.<//text>

<Text>I've been using Wave House Cleaning for about a year and they are fantastic. They are very responsive to questions and concerns and their cleaners COVID protocols have been great. They do an excellent job and any feedback I've given about what I would like them to clean or how is always taken into consideration. Thank you so much for your help and service!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Wave house did a great job! My place was honestly a mess when I was moving out, and the cleaner they sent did an amazing job at cleaning every single corner of the apartment. I got all of my deposit  back and the place looked spotless afterwards. The cleaner was also very nice!<//text>

I've been using Wave for a several years now-- even through COVID--and I've been very happy with them. My apartment is clean and I don't have to dust! There have been a few occasions when the cleaner doesn't show up on time, but that's always been rectified quickly, and they're very responsive. Their precautions during the pandemic have made me feel very safe having them in my home. I think their pricing hits the sweet spot between being affordable for me and fair to the cleaners. Overall, I'm very glad I found Wave!< /review>

I booked a cleaning for Saturday 4/8 and could not be happier with the service Marques and Theresa provided. They were very efficient and no detail was missed. I'll definitely be using Wave House Cleaning. Highly Recommend!</review>

The people at Wave are extremely kind, courteous and professional! They were able to accommodate my need for short notice cleaning before a new roommate moved in. When the cleaners arrived they were very nice, Gloria and the other workers far exceeded my expectation! Getting things in the kitchen clean I never was able to! I highly recommend Wave, when someone does things right, it's well worth the money spent.<//Text>

<Text>Dayana cleaned our apartment recently and we could not have been happier. We have a lot of small delicate nic-nacs that she was very careful with. We came home to a Wave House Cleaning apartment which she clearly took her time with. We will be booking a recurring service with Dayana, she did a fantastic job! Worth every penny!</Text><user_id>102562455971163413307< /user_id>< Pics>

They do a pretty good job and it does vary between cleaners. It is a tad more expensive, however for the ease, reliability, flexibility and the fact that we don't regularly have a cleaner its worth it.  Dayana was the best so far and I asked about floors in kitchen and bathroom specifically and she made sure to focus on that and was super responsive via text when she finished.

<Text>It was very easy to book the first cleaning appointment online, and after that, I was able to set up monthly cleanings via email. Since then, Carlos and Rosi have been leaving my apartment amazingly clean. They work very efficiently and they get the job done quickly. Payments get automatically charged to my credit card, so it's nice not having to worry about writing checks or having cash available. Highly recommended!< /Text>< pics>

This was a move-out cleaning. The apartment was extremely messy and I felt very stressed out about it. By the time they left, it was very clean and I was relieved! They were kind and pleasant. Money well spent. My only recommendation is if you don't speak decent Spanish, download a translation app or ask them to keep theirs handy. They used it some but not all of the time and it was helpful.</review><rate>4<//rate><time>1599031609516< /time><user_name>Charles Drake< /user_name>< user>

<date>1594458203589</date><text>So I had to find someone who was willing to clean up after an epic party at a luxury condo. Emerson was very responsive to my request and showed up early! He has a great demeanor, hard work ethic, and very thorough in his work. He asked all the right questions (what countertops are stone so he can apply the correct cleaning methods). I would absolutely use him again and the first person I would call for cleaning services.<//text>< Name>

We have twin toddlers and we were getting ready to list our house on the market when Wave Cleaning came out and made our house pristine. Nothing was overlooked and extra attention and thoughtful care was put into the work our cleaner did. We will for sure use again.<//Text>

I've been a client of Sparkling Clean since 2015. I found them after some frustrating experiences with other agencies. Scheduling, canceling, and rescheduling appointments is pretty stress free. The staff is very responsive to client communication and responds to emails very quickly. Prices are competitive and reasonable.<//Review>

< review>
I have been using Heather's Home Cleaning for several months now.  I have found that they are very reliable and, most important, they care about my satisfaction as a customer.  Heather texts me after every visit to ask me how the cleaners' visit went.  I really like that.  There have been very few times I ever gave feedback about something that needed fixing/changing/redoing, but when I did, they took care of it right away.  I also like that the cleaners will suggest something regarding a potential problem area and we address it on the next visit.  I would recommend them to anyone.< /review>

<text>This was our first experience with a cleaning service and couldn't be happier. The whole place was spotless, and there were even little touches like pillows being organized in a really pleasant way, and the tissue boxes having fun little flower type designs sticking out of them done with tissues.

Well worth the service, we're going to be scheduling a monthly cleaning!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I so appreciate Wave House Cleaning.  We have a house in Torrance that was newly remodeled and they have been coming once a month to keep it in brand new condition.  I appreciate all you guys do and your time and effort you put into the cleaning.  We took a risk in signing up for this service because I didn't know anyone that had used it, but now I can say for sure this is GREAT!  They have come 3 times thus far and each time done a great job.  I would recommend them no problem. I also love the online booking ability.  So, techie and up to the 90's. LOL...

I highly recommend Wave House Cleaning. After doing some research and trials with several different companies, I was impressed with Wave. All the way from customer service, booking appointments online and the personnel that arrive are all outstanding. I have never ha Rb a problem. I’m comfortable leaving my house, running errands while the staff take good care of my home. The flexibility of appointment times are great too. I tend to make appointments last minute due to my busy schedule. Never have they let me down. I wIll continue to use their services and recommend them to f row da and family.< /review>

Wow.  My house is cleaner than it's ever been.  From start to finish, Jaime and his crew did a spectacular job on the deep spring clean.  He was great at communicating, and is generally kind and thoughtful. The actual cleaning was so thorough and detailed. And no nasty chemicals!  The air in my house even feels clean.< /Text>

I was very happy with my first experience. There was a small mishap with the arrival time (that’s the reason for the 4 stars). I scheduled them to get there before I went to work and they ended up being a little late past the end of their window of time because they couldn’t find parking. Once they finally told me, I went down and let them into my visitors parking. I’ll make sure that’s apparent next time. I let her in, she brought all her own stuff and I headed out. When I got back, everything looked great! Going to book again now for the start of the year!< /Review>

I have used wave housecleaning multiple times in the past two years sometimes I use the deep cleaning and sometimes just the upkeep. I love love their customer service. I once ran into an issue of one of the cleaners blocking the sink(accidents do happen) and Juan the manager was more than just helpful to help resolve the issue. The cleaners are really nice too,  they come in , you have to just show them around and they're on their own I never had to supervise them,they check in with me when they're done and if I have any corrections they fix it.I love their business model,It is so easy to make an appointment on their website, their website is clean and very functional. And the best part is there is no time limit the cleaners take their time to make sure you're satisfied:)

I highly recommend wave cleaning! Here's to a cleaner house!<//text>

Wave House is absolutely wonderful!  They're so easy to book with over email, they arrive on time, and they do such an amazing job.  Their pricing is very reasonable for what you get.  It's so nice coming home after work to a clean space.  You can't go wrong with Wave House.</Review>

The cleaning professionals are always super sweet and friendly, and the place is always sparkling and spotless. I am always really happy with the results and automatic cleanings scheduled every 2 weeks.

The customer service teams are really helpful with booking/re-scheduling too.<//review><username>Natasha Gross< /username><time>1519257382066</time><response>None</response>< Pictures>

I really like this company. Toni was great to work with on scheduling.

We've used Leo twice now and he's incredible. He is quiet and unassuming, really sweet guy. He does great work and does it quickly.<//Text>

Hi There,

We just wanted to let you know that we had a great experience with the last cleaner. I believe her name was Carla. I did not meet her personally but I came home to a house that didn't smell with any cleaners & everything was great. Very grateful.

It was the first time for us to be this happy. We would love to see her each time if this is possible. Thanks so much! She did a great job and we wanted you to know.

Best,
Mark and Monica</Text>

Always have had great customer service with Wave and have been using them for 2 yrs.  If there is any issue they take care of you right away and are very nice to work with.  If a cleaner missed something Wave will have someone come out asap to finish the job if needed.  Elizabeth came out last week and she is wonderful so pleasant, professional, and does great work.</text>

Fabulous cleaning! It was easy to book, they arrived within the window of time, were great with my 2 dogs and had the place spotless!  I am so happy I left my previous service for them.   Everything from their wonderful disposition to customer service was great! After today's cleaning scheduled bi-weekly services. THANK YOU!!!< /Text>

This company was a rip-off.  Their housekeeper spent only two hours doing what they called a "deep-cleaning" charging me $140 for a poor cleaning job with a Swiffer.  This was a move-out assignment and the homeowner was so unhappy with all the things that were missed she charged me $200 to have a two person crew come and clean for 3 hours to fix what Wave Housekeeping missed. Also, their housekeeper showed up way too early for the appointment window, left to get her eyebrows done, and then didn't come back until AFTER the appointment arrival window had closed.  She also had an attitude like it was my fault she was not on time.  I informed Wave Housekeeping of the issues, pictures, video and even copies of call records and emails from the homeowner.  After weeks of this I was given only a %35 refund despite their %100 gaurantee.  UPDATE: A day after I posted this review they gave me a FULL refund and the matter has been resolved satisfactorily.  I hope that other people who use their service have a better experience than I did.<//Text>

Everything was great. We were in desperate need of a deep-clean for our 2 bd. 2 bath apartment. The ladies were there for about 3 hours and left the place looking better than it ever has! They're incredibly thorough - got into all the nooks and crannies and really helped with the problem areas that were our bathrooms and kitchen. We will absolutely be using Wave regularly!</Review>

< Review>
Our house is absolutely IMMACULATE after Wave House Cleaning came. We had them come and clean our apartment after our tenant moved out, and it was better than when we bought it over a year previously. They were 30 minutes late, but that wasn’t really an issue because it was first thing in the morning. Also, we didn’t have power because the tenants were transitioning, and they brought a huge extension chord so they could plug in the hallway and still get vacuuming done. We booked them with only 2 days notice, and notified them about the power situation at midnight the night before and they were still good to go by 9:30 am. They brought 3 workers and were done in 2.5 hours for a 1,500 square foot condo. Highly recommend!</Review>

<Review>I highly recommend this company. The cleaners are professional and work quickly, but thoroughly. The first time I used the service I had dishes washed and some of them were had to be rewashed, but I've been satisfied with the rest of the cleaning and I have used it twice now.< /Review>< Rating>

This was my first time using Wave House Cleaning, and I will definitely use them again. This is the best cleaning job yet. I think with any house cleaner you will have to tell them how you like certain things done, and after the cleaning I really had nothing to say. She was on time, so nice, thorough, and left my place sparkling. Very happy and would definitely recommend!<//Text>

Juana did a perfect job.  She was very thorough and very kind, and considering the state of my apartment pre-cleaning, I think she went above and beyond.  Booking was easy and customer service was very nice as well, so I'll definitely be using Wave again.<//Review>

<text>We tried Wave House Cleaning after using the same housekeeper for an extended period of time. We decided to use a service so that there would be a way to provide specific instructions and to give feedback. The crew assigned to us for our first visit arrived on time and were very detail-oriented. They brought all of there own equipment and cleaning supplies, even a large step ladder. Our house was very clean after they left. I'm looking forward to them coming again.<//text></record>

<review>I have been looking for a good cleaning service for a long time. I have taken advice from Next Door, tried people that leave fancy fliers on my porch...all of them left something to be desired. Wave House has exceeded all of my previous experiences, by far. First off, the customer service is fantastic. They work with you to find the perfect time. When you find cleaners that you love, they make sure to place them with you for subsequent cleanings. The people that work for this company are efficient, sweet, and professional. Thanks, Wave House!</review>< time>

<review>We've been using Wave for the past year and we can't be happier with the service. Wave allows online booking, which is extremely convenient for our busy, toddler-filled lifestyle these days. What's more, the cleaners do a great job. During one cleaning, we felt the cleaners forgot to clean the floors, so we contacted Wave and they sent a cleaner out the next day. Great service!</review>< time>

I love this service - they have always been extremely reliable, coming on time (even though they give a 1 hour window) and my 3 bedroom 2 bath house is clean within 2 to 2.5 hours. I did the deep cleaning first and I got the fridge cleaned too. Now  I just clean every two weeks and I am very satisfied with the service. I request Carlos and Maria, who are a really great team and seem to find every nook and cranny of my dust & dirt.  Really nice people to work with. It's also very easy to set up my appointments. I just email and ask for availability. They have 3 possible times. I find the prices very reasonable. Thank you Wave!< /Review>

We were very happy with our service from Wave House Cleaning. The cleaner was friendly and professional and arrived within the one hour window that was booked. The deep cleaning took about 2 hours for our 1 bd 1 bath apartment. We were very happy with the results, the place looked and smelled great! I also felt the pricing was reasonable for the service provided. We will definitely be using this service again.<//Review>

<Review>I love this service - they have always been extremely reliable, coming on time (even though they give a 1 hour window) and my 3 bedroom 2 bath house is clean within 2 to 2.5 hours. I did the deep cleaning first and I got the fridge cleaned too. Now  I just clean every two weeks and I am very satisfied with the service. I request Carlos and Maria, who are a really great team and seem to find every nook and cranny of my dust & dirt.  Really nice people to work with. It's also very easy to set up my appointments. I just email and ask for availability. They have 3 possible times. I find the prices very reasonable. Thank you Wave!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I've had Wave House Cleaning clean my house twice so far and I am so happy with the quality of their work that I set up ongoing bi-weekly service. The staff has always arrived on time and are pleasant, professional and thorough. I love the email reminders a couple of days before the scheduled cleaning. Juan provides excellent customer service and wants to make sure there is 100% customer satisfaction. I am so glad that I found Wave House Cleaning!< /Review>

<Review>Wave Cleaners are great. It's nice that it feels like a small operation, vs Handy that feels like a machine and the cleanings aren't as thorough. We have found a set of cleaners through Wave that we've requested to come back next time since they did such a good job (nice little touches like arranging the pillows and towels don't go unnoticed!). We originally had a woman coming independently to our house, but we moved across town and she couldn't come that far. So we started using Handy, but the service was impersonal and it didn't feel like the cleaners were personally invested in doing their best. We found Wave on Yelp and they've been great - quick responses and helpful. I hope their next step is to make an app or online appointment system to make it even easier. Very satisfied with this service and will continue to use. Thanks Wave!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2baebc264c881:0x628e34022c4460e4<//Gmap_id></record>

My wife and I decided to try Wave before a house guest came to visit.  We have tried other cleaning services in the area like Handy and Tidy, and the results from those other services were very disappointing.  We went with Wave based on the positive online reviews, and I'm very happy that I did.  Zulma showed up on time (within the hour window we had chosen).  She was kind, positive, and needed no instruction.  She brought all of her own supplies, including mop and vacuum, and by the time she was done, the house was spotless.  We was particularly impressed with how well she cleaned out the inside of the oven.  It looked brand new!  Great service, reasonable price.  We will definitely be recurring customers.< /text>

<text>I just had my first cleaning with Wave this week - great experience overall! There was some initial confusion when I tried to leave a voicemail twice (that they said they didn't receive), but they are incredibly responsive by email, so that seems like the best way to contact them. On the day of cleaning the office called to let me know that my house cleaners were running about 10-15 minutes late - I really appreciated this contact as I was waiting at home to get them started. My initial cleaning was a "deep clean" and I'm very satisfied with the results! I will definitely use Wave again on a regular basis.</text>< Pics>

<Text>I was incredibly apprehensive to hire cleaners, as I never have before, and I was very pleasantly surprised by Wave House.  They arrived promptly at the time designated, allowing me to get to work on time, and when I stopped back home around lunch everything was immaculate.  The two cleaners had done everything from wiping the blinds to putting away our dishes to making our beds - and they even remembered to bring back the visitor parking pass I lent them!  The customer service was also very helpful and responsive in crediting me for the Yelp deal I purchased.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<review>I have been using Wave for several years. I use email to communicate with them mostly and for the most part service is very good. Sometimes things get crossed but they have always accepted their actions and given me good customer service.  When the previous clean person I had moved away I had one bad person. Wave did a fabulous job of making it right and then sent me Sarah. She is awesome and I couldn't be happier!<//review>< rating>

<Review>Booked Wave House for their cleaning services twice so far in the few weeks and had the pleasure of Alejandro & Ariana's service both times! They are super professional, thorough, and fast! They arrive equipped with their products and tools, but are so accommodating in using the organic cleaning products I have at home. I've recommended them to my friends!!</Review>< UserId.>

< Review>
I've been using Wave for about 9 months now.  I live alone (with a big dog) in a moderately sized 2 bedroom apartment and I'm a very neat person, so I only have them come once a month to frankly do the things I don't want to do, like clean the showers and my stove.  They do a great job and the women who have come into my home couldn't have been nicer or more friendly to my dog (which is very important to me).

Speaking of showers, it's often the little things that define quality of service.  This week the woman who cleaned my place got my glass shower door cleaner than I've ever been able to get it.  It's long suffered from years and years of hard water and soap deposits.  Not even CLR could get it all clean.  But after this week's cleaning it is completely clear. I don't know what she used, but it was amazing.

It's also often how a company handles service issues that defines quality of service.  The one time I contacted the office about something the cleaner missed (a floor left wet after being cleaned), they got back to me almost immediately and offered to send someone to fix the situation right away.</Review>

<Review>Our house is "garden level" and had gotten VERY dusty and moldy after three years of sub par self cleaning. We scheduled a deep clean with Delia & Amarilis and they did a wonderful job! For the first time this month, I haven't had to take allergy meds as soon as I got home. They were on time and professional. Will definitely call Wave House Cleaning again.<//Review></record>

<review>The service is great, you can schedule times via website or email.  I have a regular recurring appointment but they are able to accommodate changes, easily.  Payments are set up online, so no need to deal with leaving a check or cash for the cleaner.  The add on options are great so that the pricing for a general clean is low, and if you need more you can request ala carte.  Their customer service is helpful and responsive.  Simple, easy, no hassle.<//review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I've had recurring housekeeping services from different sources while living in dtla, Beverly hills, and Santa Monica. So far, I find Yalsi from Wave to be the most consistent. For the past 6 months, I had scheduled her to come every 3 weeks--she's always on time, quick, and thorough. The price is also very reasonable. The admin staff is also great as they are very easy to reach and communicate with via email or phone. I have recommended Wave to many of my friends and colleagues already.

Update: Few years later, I have moved to a much bigger house in another city and still impressed with Wave Cleaning. Great customer service, ease of scheduling, punctual, competitive prices, and impeccable cleaning!

I've been wanting to have periodic maid service for some time, however, my significant other is not very trusting after she had some jewelry boosted by some movers.  I convinced her that we'd go with a company that is insured and I'd leave work early to be at the home while the cleaning occurred.  After scouring Yelp and Google reviews and their straight forward pricing, I decided to go with Wave House Cleaning.

Scheduling was a breeze.  I scheduled for a 3PM cleaning.  I got home at 2:45PM and the maid was already there!  I opened the door and the maid (Marisol?) got right to work, attacking the master bath first.  No easy task as my gf uses a number of hair/aerosol products that cause a layer of gunk to build up on the flat surfaces in the bathroom.  I spot checked and she got everything...very impressed!

The maid did my entire 2 bedroom/2 bath apartment in about 3 hours and 20 minutes.  This was their "deep clean" as required for the 1st cleaning.

My apartment is all hardwood floors with area rugs.  Not sure I would have been impressed with the vacuum the maid brought if I had more carpeting but was sufficient for my apartment's needs.

The customer service was great.  I got a call the morning of the cleaning to confirm and had all my questions answered.  I definitely plan on using them again before my parents visit in mid-September.</Review>

I've had the best experience with Wave House Cleaning so far! I've used them 3 times and have been so happy with the results each time.

I have a 1 bedroom apartment and paid $109.99 for the initial deep clean (she cleaned everywhere, even the walls!) and have paid $69.99 for the subsequent cleans.  The cleaners have arrived within the hour time frame they give you and usually on the earlier side.

The length of time the cleaners are there have varied (maybe due to how much I have "pre-cleaned?").  Everything looks sharp and organized when they leave.  For the price and service, I will be sticking with Wave House Cleaning as long as I can!!<//review>

<text>I have used Wave House Cleaning for 3 years. They are always very courteous and do an excellent job! Appointments for cleanings are a breeze to book and usually get an email response within an hour. I have reccomended Wave House Cleaning to many friends and will continue to do so in the future.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I have tried multiple cleaning companies. The cleaners from Wave are much more reliable than some of other cleaning companies and I have been kept using them for 2 years.</Text>

<Text>I've become a loyal customer of WHC. Had 4 or 5 cleanings already. Last time Irma did a great job with deep cleaning.Came in earlier, left my place perfectly clean and shiny with little touches of care. All things were at their places. WHC management has been always responsive to my requests and changes. Continue sticking with them.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I've had my house cleaned about 5-6 times by Wave House and it was a perfect experience every time.
Scheduling was very easy, the cleaners were always on time, and they were done on time or earlier than they said they would be. Customer service is also great, they always reply to my emails same day or by the next day and to my phone calls within an hour or so.

Having a very young child at home, I was looking for a cleaning company that uses green products. They said that they use neutral products, and in fact there is no strong odor from the cleaning solutions after they've finished. Just a light lemon scent which is gone after airing out my apartment briefly. I haven't had a bad experience yet and look forward to continue having my house cleaned by them.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I first hired Wave House Cleaning in October. Unfortunately, my first two experiences weren't stellar (the first service was a "deep cleaning" but didn't vacuum/mop under any furniture, didn't clean or move kitchen counter appliances, wipe cupboards, etc). But when I submitted my honest feedback, I received a prompt reply and apology with an offer to send another cleaner out to finish the job, The second cleaner did do a better job, but didn't have a very positive attitude about it. Again, the Wave manager apologized and the third team was the CHARM! Their "basic cleaning" was much more thorough than the first "deep cleaning" - and more - even wiping down every bottle in the bathrooms and kitchen. - and repeat 3 weeks later.
As long as I can continue to get the same team - I can say I'm very happy with Wave House Cleaning!<//Text>

<text>I recently received services and I was pleased for the most part. Overall, the cleaning was to my liking, however, I wish they'd move countertop appliances and cleaned underneath and behind those areas. Same in bathrooms, they do not move anything. They clean the sink, the tub, toilet, but did not move my stand (four drawers) to clean underneath and behind it. My microwave and crockpot along with my Keurig and pod holder were not moved.
My hubby suggested we just move those things next time to have those areas cleaned as well.
As I stated, the overall service ( arrival, professionalism, and attitude) was good.
I will use again and see if the adjustments are helpful.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2baebc264c881:0x628e34022c4460e4</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I like this grocery store but they are constantly moving things around.  They are also constantly running out of items and im not talking about the covid hard to get items.  They just have poor management from what i can tell.  Employees are friendly and helpful and the store is generally clean.  Produce could be a little better... but its not bad.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><date>1602227472231</date><rating>4</rating>< userid>

This is the most fantastic place to shop around. I really admire the way they cook their meat tri-tip. They are very professional, and committed to their services. They got great respect to all their customers too. Recommended!!< /text>

Was always a good shopping experience here, no customer service issues or stock issues. Long lines around mid afternoon? That’s anywhere, we tend to think we’re an exception to the rule at times, nope, it’s 4/5pm your not the only one getting off work! Lol! But this location is amongst the best I visited. Keep it up!< /Text>

Good service it gets pretty busy on the weekends. Best time to go is early in the mornings. They usually have two express lanes when it's busy.< /text>

I live around the corner from this market and have been coming here for about 8 years. The store has definately step up their service and remodeled the store since i first started shopping here. They have a giant parking lot, open at 6am which comes in handy for those early morning milk runs. Have a really nice meat and bakery dept. now. The customer service is still hit or miss but not as bad at it used to be.<//Text>

<Text>This Food4Less was outstanding why was it outstanding? It was outstanding because I didn't feel out of place like I did when I went to food 4 less on imperial and Studebaker.
You can practically feel the racism when you walk into that particular Food4Less in Norwalk. so from now on when I'm coming home I will make it my business to make this particular Food4Less my stop 4 my household needs as far as groceries etc.<//Text>< pics>

It's a decent super market. Checkout lines can get a bit crazy especially when people take their sweet time bagging their groceries. Prices are good and they do live up to the name of Food 4 Less. Quality of certain easily perishable produce is a bit questionable, but otherwise decent quality. I have noticed that a lot of fresh food items tend to spoil quite a bit faster than say when I buy produce from Ralph's, which is weird considering they are actually part of the same company Kroger.<//Text>

Why is there no, self checkout ?  Especially when employees/ cashiers are allowing customers with more than 15 items, in the so call "express lane".   Managers need to make sure that cashiers are keeping up with cleaning counters at the register, and card readers.  Counters are dirty and sticky.</Review>

Clean, stocked,  organized,  and fast check out during their visit. Shopped at these stores since the beginning.  This location  does not have the best parking lot, can't  understand why people can't  put the shopping  cart back in its place.</Text>

Don't bother calling for any info; spoke to a person who "was looking for someone to answer my question" and was on hold for 10 minutes. In the end, they hung up.

I get there in person and go to customer service to ask my question, nobody there. An employee walks there to take a look inside the office and walks away, without even asking me or telling me anything, as if I wasn't there. Crappy customer service overall.< /Text>

People please check the USE by date a lot of items I've purchased have expired a month ago or so.  It leads me to believe this store doesn't do well with sales.  Too many things are out dated I may be shopping else where.  The management is rude and acts as if they not understanding what I'm saying but thanks to Calvin the cashier I keep coming back but no more shopping here for me who continues to sale brown ground beef or brown any other meats.  I'm gonna go in there just to take pictures of there brown meats.<//text>

This store has very bad customer service cashiers are rude. Always 1 to 3 lines open and mostly its the fast lanes. Cant even say on the produce area is very bad i hardly ever see fresh  fruit. Whats going on! This used to be one of my favorites stores to shop at i would travel from lynwood just to go to that place but oh no everything has changed always keep an eye ont the he expiration dates because specially on the breads they expire within 3 days of the date you are shopping. Terrible!! Will not be shopping there again. Bye food4 less!!<//review>

<user>101445250992690697068</user>< review>
My brother, 74 yr old father and I were shopping at this store today around 10 am. My father has dementia amongst other health issues. We were on the can food aisle she he reached over to get a can of tomato sauce and an employee who was stocking the shelves said a very rude and racist comment about my father. She stated that people don't say excuse me and that she bet my father didn't speak English which he doesn't but understands English very well. She should've been a bit more profesional and kept her stupid remarks to herself. Whether my dad spoke English or not didn't give her the right to discriminate him in the way she did. And if he spoke english or not was none of her freaking business. We complained to management and from what we were told it's not the first time she does it. I don't understand why she's still working there and not fired. If I wanted to I could've said something racist to her about her ugly damn self but I didn't. I could've cause a commotion and made her stupid ass get fired right then and there, but I didn't. I was so shocked as to why this particular chain of stores would have a racist ass person working there knowing that she's a continuous problem. Fire her,  get rid of the trash!!!!<//review>

The meat department is very unorganized and unprofessional behavior. For that reason I would never buy meat at this store any more. Everything else is fine. This store has lost a long time customer.< /Review>

So im only giving this place 3 stars because of the lack of cleanliness it offers, everything is good just it smells bad like theres no way the meat is rotting ....but everything is ok they have shampoo and conditioner and other products for hair , hair ties , etc , they have a good selection of dry snacks and energy drinks but the lines do tend to get long sometimes the employees need to change there attitude .but overral i wouldnt buy meat from here i just dont think it tantalizes me...some veggies are good here , just not all of them its the smell in there i dont know it bothers me .<//Review>
