<Review>I love Handley's I shopped here for many years. They have always had a wide and wonderful selection of western items for you from head to toe. Another establishment I have no business being in, there's always an item or items that I don't have or need or just gotta have. The pricing is very moderate for the market of today and always has been. Do drop in some time I know you will find something that you like want or just gotta have. The staff is wonderful and very friendly and helpful.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Julie was super friendly, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable. She steamed and tediously attended to shaping the hat to my preference while I explored their abundant colorful shirts, wide array of hats, and numerous belts, buckles, beadwork, blankets, etc.

Not only was this family heirloom brought to it's former glory, the service was completely free and QUICK. I will definitely be sending anyone who's looking for quality products and service that way and plan to do my holiday shopping there soon.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I've been looking for a good western wear store, and finally found this place. The hours are a bit tight, and it's far from my house, but it was totally worth it. They've got a nice selection of boots and hats,  and very friendly and helpful people there. I wasn't shopping for work pants, but noticed they have a good selection packed into that store. I'll definitely be back.< /Text>

<review>I travel for 2 hours to LA. This was my 2nd stop. This shop is own by a very kind Asian couple. In the beginning they were just a little caution as they should be. They allow us to try on their wigs and was very helpful and attentive even with multiple people in the store.
The English was a little broken,  But this was just fine with me they're here doing their best.
I will go again and recommend giving them a try. I did purchase a wig.<//review>< rate>

<Text>I came here for a very last minute wig and although he opened up 10 minutes late the service was worth it. The woman was incredibly kind, gentle, and patient. She put so many wigs on me until I found one I liked and even gave me a free wig cap!<//Text><GmapID>0x80c2b8fe9c819b65:0xbffc1ce80856d876</GmapID></record>

Been with them for 4 yrs. The older couple are very polite and patient.  Sometimes give you discounts if you're a good customer to them. Diverse set of wigs with Decent prices.   I love this little spot.< /Review>

Reasonable prices and awesome service! I don't normally leave reviews but I got a lace front for just $35! It's not real hair but it looks extremely convincing, not too shiny or choppy, and heat resistant so I can easily re-style.  Pretty good selection and the best prices and service I have had at a wig place so far. I'm sad I don't live in town or this would be my go to place. The owners were mega nice and helpful, getting down and letting me look at 4 different wigs to make sure I got what I wanted.  10000% satisfied!< /text>

My first time doing yoga in 10 years. I am not flexible and my body shape is not the best. Alex, the yoga instructor made the class fun. I felt very comfortable being in the class. I took two breaks in between the session because I was not feeling well and I needed to step out to get fresh air, I didn’t feel judge but others for leaving the classroom. Everyone in the class smiled and they were friendly to meZ definitely coming back. Also,
There is a monthly special that is $45 for unlimited classes for a month.< /text>

One of the best yoga studios in the neighborhood. There’s no fancy gyms around but you don’t need one with Bikram Yoga Daly City. The place is always clean. They’re always on time with class. They encourage the students to delve deeper in the postures without making it feel like a boot camp class. They’re very welcoming. I have brought numerous friends for a trial session here and they end up loving it. The class is perfect for beginners or those deeper in their practice.
Namaste.<//Review>

<date>1554615889805< /date><review>Couldn't be happier with my experience at this Yoga studio. I enjoyed both Bikram Yoga and Yin Yoga. The instructors are professional and super helpful. Laura is my favorite Bikram Yoga instructor who sincerely cares your progress and always offers constructive feedback on your posture during/post class. Summer's Yin Yoga class is my must go on each Sunday. To me Bikram Yoga is a physical training (and to some extent a mind power training for endurance) while Yin Yoga provides me a chance to connect with myself and inner energy. Always feel recharged after the class thanks to Summer's guidance. Wish I could find time to come more often.< /review>< gmap_id>

<review>Purchased the unlimited month deal. Because it was unlimited I took advantage of ever chance I could get to get to a class. In that one month I had major progress. I pushed myself with the help of some great teachers.

Expect to sweat, expect to be around others who sweat and expect to see sweat. You cant avoid it.

Location: Easy to find
Parking: Busy location, give yourself time to find parking
Studio: Showers available and caddy tray with some of the essentials if needed. Lobby area has nice seating for cool down or to chat quietly with other students.
Adds: Towels and mats available to rent< /review>< pictures>

Small but powerful yoga studio! All instructors are knowledgeable in their practice and are super helpful to students of all backgrounds and level.

Bikram Hot Yoga is the best gift you can give yourself, friends, or family.  The classes are good for mind, body, and your well-being.  While the heated room takes some adjustment, the benefits you gain from it is priceless.  It’s all about determination; allow Bikram instructors help you reach your goal.  Come join and see for yourself!< /text>

<review>I've been practicing Bikram Yoga now for about 4 years or so and just switched my home studio to Daly City as it works better with my daily routines, it's also a great studio to practice at in terms of the facility and teachers, etc. I've practiced at many studios, and this is definitely one of the good ones.  (I am NOT a yoga teacher, btw)

Of course a review of the studio is almost trivial compared to a review of Bikram Yoga itself, regardless of the studio you choose to practice at.

Each pose is specifically designed to work on the body in a certain way, and they have also been carefully put into the correct order to have a synergistic effect, as the next pose takes advantage of the previous pose and is therefore more effective.

The health of your body is just the beginning, as a long term practice will also benefit you by providing one of the most precious gifts you can give yourself, which is to develop a mind that can witness itself.  It's a question of whether you have your thoughts, or do your thoughts have you?   It is both a subtle, but infinitely critical capability that effects how you see the world and those around you.  Practicing Bikram Yoga gives you an excellent place to develop that kind of perspective.

We all know that money can't buy you love and happiness...but if you spend that money on a Bikram Yoga membership, and make it a regular practice, 3 times a week for a while, I think you might have the same reaction I've had, which was, "damn, I wish I had started doing this years ago!"   :)

Seriously, you've tried all manner of other ways to figure out the love and happiness thing....and by now you might be getting a little suspicious that looking for it "out there" might not be the best approach.  Yoga is one of those things that forces you to look and work on yourself, and I'm starting to suspect that maybe that's a better place to start when looking for how to find fulfillment in life.

Of course I might be wrong, maybe I just need to buy more lottery tickets... :)  I'll let you decide for yourself.</review>< gmapID>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>I was terrified to try bikram yoga after avoiding it for almost 5 years, since my first class (not at this studio). However, since I’ve tried it again with Bikram Hot Yoga, I’ve found that it’s been one of the best workout practices I’ve ever done. I feel mentally and physically stronger, my sleep is better and I feel more motivated to do things outside of the class to live a healthier life. I’ve been going 2-3 times of week. Each class and teacher has something to offer, so I know no matter what class time I choose I’m going to have a great session.<//Text><userid>104449630475168300592< /userid>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Bikram Hot Yoga in Daly City was my first experience at any type of Yoga. I have since had to travel and felt the need to visit another Bikram Yoga place. The other place (in SoCal) had carpet and immediately had a horrible smell on entering the room. The classroom felt uncomfortable with too much lighting and I felt very self conscious of my body.  I really appreciate the focus at Daly City, I feel very good in my own skin because the leaders of the class do a fantastic job at keeping everyone focused on their own bodies and minds. I have never felt ashamed of my imperfect body, instead I have come to appreciate it for all the great things it can do. I love the floor at Daly City, no carpet, no smell, the lighting is perfect. I feel energized every day after Bikram, I haven’t felt this type of energy since I was in high school. I’m loving it, totally recommend it!<//Review></record>

The instructors are excellent and the variety of class times is great!  The size of the classroom is HUGE compared to a lot of other studios, which makes such a difference when you're in a crowded class.    As a beginner is was really important for me to be able to see myself in the mirror, so a large room was really beneficial.  Highly recommend!<//review>< pics>

A most excellent experience.  Started Bikram yoga almost 3 years ago and this is maybe the 4th studio I have done practice.  The prior review is spot on this studio is the real deal.  The teachers are in great yoga condition, friendly and instructional.

The studio always has plenty of space, its clean and inviting.  Most importantly, there are shower facilities and for the guys they seem to be under utilized as I always have immediate access after practice.

The schedule is reliable and there are times throughout the day everyday to practice.

I love this place.</text>

<text>Had a tremendous experience taking a class with Kelly and will definitely be back.I have a lot of nagging knots and pains in my back. In the morning one knot was acting up to the point that I thought I might skip my work outs and go get a massage instead. The knot got out. I keep in reasonably decent shape so I was able to keep up (with a few breathers) but it was a very different, intense experience. Enjoyed Kelly's approach, which was supportive but firm (definitely a bit of a "suck it up, I know you can do better" attitude.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808f7c5c31bf8767:0xeccb683c9fb0cb3b<//gmapID></record>

Bought a Bikram yoga groupon because I've been wanting to try it I actually liked it.  It is 90 minutes of yoga inside a hot room.  During my first and second sessions, I felt lightheaded a few times so I just laid down to rest for a bit and tried again when I felt better.  The instructor won't let you leave and just recommends you to lay down and rest til you feel better and finish the session.  The instructors were great and if it's your first and second time, they help you out and correct you with the positions.

I just wish it's not too expensive because I really liked it.

It was a great experience and I like that you feel good right after each session.</text>

This place is nice and the studio is a good size, not too big. The carpet smell hits you right when you walk into the studio, which is not very inviting. But the staff is really helpful and very nice. I have not been to enough classes to say whether the instructors are good or not, but the classes that I have been to, the instructors are average. I wished that the instructors didn't use microphones though. I always thought that yoga should not be like a seminar. My other complaint is their class times. I really hope they have something around 4:30 or 5pm. They have classes 3:45 then at 5:45pm, which is either too early and too late for me. The location is very convenient, and parking is not too bad.< /text>

The front desk staff members are super friendly, pleasant, and welcoming.  The facility is  clean, spacious, and nicely decorated.  The yoga classroom is spacious, clean, well carpeted and the heat/airflow is well circulated.</review>

I've been practicing Bikram yoga about five years. I've been to many studios in the Bay Area and this studio doesn't compare (not close) to any of the others. The studio is clean, comfortable and plenty of room to practice. All the instructors are FABULOUS! I enjoy practicing at this studio and hope to practice for many years to come :-)< /review>

Dirty bathrooms, poorly maintained place, mean staff, and over priced packages. The owners are horrible teachers but good at changing the yoga for the students.
As long as you sign on for a membership, owner takes the money, and you can ask for anything. Just email the owners. They are very receptive.
If you ask for 60 minute classes, music in the room, cooler temperature, candlelight, or kids class, the owners will do it. You can even ask for different class times, and they will find a way to make it happen. The teachers are not so receptive. They just do the same boring 90 minute thing. The good part is you can do whatever you want but the bad part is its not a real Bikram School. If you need "therapeutic hatha yoga" I would try North Beach.</text>

When I first started yoga, I went to Seacliff.  I started going to Daly City when it opened and loved most of the instructors.  Suzanne was the best!  I had to take a long break when I got pregnant and now go to San Mateo when time permits.  I love all of Christian's studios.  Wish I had more time to do more yoga!!</Review>

<Review>Daly city is the first place I went to for Yoga Practice. The instructor is really nice, and I like the environment there, since it's easy to find parking and there is no bad smell.

Highly recommend this location over SF ones....<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

However, once your joints opened up as you attend more classes, you will find yourself doing the correct poses. I really recommended taking Michael’s class. The only class that I could stay the whole 90 mins. The only ladies would glare at me really mean when I leave 70 mins in. Idk I don’t feel the energy from them lol.

< Review>
I got my butt thoroughly kicked, and felt great! It was my first time doing a 90 minute session, and had to stop a few times to pull myself together again, but the instructor made it very clear and was very encouraging for us to go at our own pace.  Which in turn made me want to push even harder!</Review>

<Text>I have always been curious about this Bikram Yoga studio at Westlake because I always pass by it. My doctor had told me that maybe trying yoga will help me with my spinal stenosis. I went on Groupon and stumbled on their awesome deal. It was perfect because I needed to add some sort of workout to my life and I lived about ten minutes away from this location. I even convinced my sister in law and my other friend to join with me. The facility at this location is pretty clean. The yoga studio doesn’t smell bad like other places I’ve been to. I like how they have mirrors around the room so you are able to see yourself. The instructors are usually full of enthusiasm and very knowledgeable. I enjoy this Bikram Yoga location a lot. They have special deals when your Groupon pass is over, and I feel like the classes are worth it considering all the factors above. I feel rejuvenated after each class and I feel like it is helping with my pain from my spinal stenosis. 5/5, I would recommend!< /Text></record>

The room didn't feel cramped at all and there were mirrors all around.  The room was hotter than the only other time I tried Bikram at another studio.  So far I have taken classes with Kelly and Jamie and both were kind and helpful; I got positive reinforcement when I got something right.  The only thing that I found to be lacking was the fact there are no real lockers other than some small ones to keep a phone and wallet in (if you give them an ID).  But they do have cubbies for clothes and such.<//text>< Response>

I could not believe that in this date in age such bad communication style is tolerated at this facility!!! I have been to a few of her classes and observed her being mean to someone every class!. How could one learn while being insulted?!

There are other nice instructors there though. Wei Wei, Michael, Robyn are all good teachers and easy to learn from.<//Text><Rate>2</Rate>< gmap_id>

After using a Groupon deal, I ended up buying a 1-year membership at this studio. My practice definitely improved my flexibility and strengthened my back. The 5:45 class was a great after work stress reliever and I liked that I rarely had problems finding parking. My favorite instructors were Jay, Kelly, and Adam.<//Review>

I am a single mother of three, work two jobs and have no time for myself. I took off one week from work in order to catch up on housework and decided to devite one day to self-care. I walked into Bikram Hot Yoga in Daly City feeling exhausted. After 90 minutes of sweating and breathing, my energy was replenished. I walked out feeling renewed! At re that, I went to get a mani pedi and now I feel like a new woman! From now on, I plan to treat myself to hot yoga once a week.< /Review>

Tried this place through a groupon. The classes were great but the carpet needs to go. It smells bad when you enter and usually it takes about 10 min to get used to the smell. The good thing is that the yoga area is big so they can fit lots of people. Parking can be tough as well.<//Review>

I bought a package from Groupon and I went to one class and then never went back. I guess I was expecting a typical yoga class with good lighting and a supportive instructor. What I experienced was a dark, dingy, impossibly humid room that smelled like ass and an instructor who could teach Marine Corps Drill Instuctors a thing or two about doing a PT session. About 40 minutes into the class I couldn't breathe well and had to leave, which thoroughly pissed off the instructor and caused her to berate me in front of the class.  I would never go back nor would I recommend this to anyone except a hardcore masochist.<//Review>

<text>This is a great experience with a positive team. This was my first exposure to bikram yoga and I was not disappointed. The moves were fairly easy to do and the practice followed a typical flow of bikram yoga. However, keep in mind,they are true to bikram. After trying this twice. and feeling horrible after both times, I'm not sure this style is for me.

I'm only deducting one hair because the studio isn't cleaned much between classes and there is a lot of dirt, sweat and hair left over from previous people.</text>< username>

My name is Sharlene, I'm not the type that likes to excise at all and I have anxiety and asthma, me like everyone else bought the coupons for $49.00 for 35 classes, when I started going there, my friend told me that I have to go there every day for the first week to get used to the heat, I went there everyday Monday to Friday except Sat. and Sunday within 1 month and a week I used all the special deal class coupons, I loved it so much , I re-new the class and  joy for a year membership.

Since my first year class had ended it in Oct.2014, I did not go back yet, because the crazy schedule. I hope I can go back soon.

Here is the following teachers/ instructors I have before and they are great always teach with TLC.
Some people might think the instructors shouldn’t call them by name and correct you in class but I think is the best thing, remember this is what you have paid for.
Also remember do bring a lots of water, it because is really not in there.

1. Adam is my first teacher, I like to give him a happy face when I see him, when he teach the Awkward pose on the third part, he always said squeeze your leg just imaging there is a hundred dollar bill between your leg and don't let go, he likes to encourage the students to try to do the best you can, he also taught me how to do toe stand pose and I'm not there yet but still trying..

2. Kelly I love her so much, very sweet, funny and always check on the students, makes sure they do at least one on every post. She will get you, if you're missed. Especially on the Triangle pose. Love the attention from her, she teaches with TLC.

3. Steve I love the way he teaches, he will go and point out to the students what  and where they need to be corrected, he will correct the post until you get it right.  I have learned from him the Eagle Pose, Locust pose and Half Tortoise pose, Love the way he teaches.

4. Jaimee I learned how to suck my stomach a lot, which is good for me, I would love to lose my fat belly. LOL

I learned a lot from the above teachers; just want to take this opportunity to say "Thank you" for being wonderful teachers and I miss my Yoga class so much.</Text>

Moe was so kind and gentle! Came to our house and washed all three of our dogs and groomed two! Can't say how much they needed it! He was prompt, spoke softly and was so so gentle with my small elderly nippy dog! Can't recommend him enough! Thank you Moe! Hope to see you again.< /review>

<review>These guys come to our home and deliver excellent service. They groom my dog regularly, and I don't have to drive to them in the heavy traffic. Very convenient. The grooming is professional and of the highest standards. You and your pet will be happy after the session. This grooming is important not just for beauty; it's also for the hygiene and health of your pet. We are lucky to have this service.</review>< GmapID>

Clean cut grooming has amazing services with an affordable price. I took my baby Bruno there to have his fur unmatted and cut. Not only are they professional when it comes to dealing with you and your dog but they do such an amazing job. My baby looked so beautiful and clean when we left. Thanks so much guys!!!</review>

<Text>I took my kitty there for a bath and nail trimming because he gets fussy. They were amazing and showed me how to do it myself without getting hurt. We finished in an hour. I even got a cute green bow tie for him. I felt confident and trusted what they were doing. I'm glad I took him they're. I purchased some electronic pet dispenser products and got a discount for being a first time customer. I highly recommend clean cut grooming it was a great experience and I actually had fun.< /Text>< username>

<review>Ya'll let me tell you how amazing this company is. As soon as i called I was greeted by a friendly woman (whose name escapes me at the moment) who helped me make an appointment to fit my schedule. I love my dog but as he is larger ( a saint Bernard) it is not easy to get him in the car and take him to the groomers. Clean cut groomers offers Mobile grooming with a wide variety of services. I paid for the full service bath, which was really affordable. Especially considering the convenience and the amazing job they did with my big baby. Thank you a million.< /review>< Pictures>

<date>1485468519373< /date><rate>5<//rate><Review>At Clean Cut Grooming I found excellent customer service and also expert grooming services for my skittish boy cat Saffron.  He is rather heavy and hates to be bathed and as such is too difficult for me to bathe alone.  He also needed his fur trimmed and claws clipped, and Clean Cut Grooming handled it all!  They treated my boy cat very gently and he really didn't get that upset about his bath.  They trimmed his fur real cute and he came out clean smelling and very handsome!  The price was great, very fair and the best price I'd been able to find calling around.  I really can't say enough good things about this full-service grooming facility.  Give them a try... I am sure you'll be as pleased as I am!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I were really nervous about taking my babies - Yorkie to a new groomer. When we arrived I was impressed ,

When I picked him up, he looked absolutely fabulous!

I've finally found a groomer that I am totally comfortable with leaving my babies and knowing they're, literally, in great hands!</Review>

I used Clean Cut Grooming for my black lab while we were traveling late last month  - we ended up staying in the area a little longer than usual and he needed a little cleaning up. I was really happy with the service, and Albie really liked the groomer. I will definitely recommend them to my friends in the area, and will definitely be using them when we go back!<//Review>

I've tried numerous groomers in the area, and nobody can seem to get my mini poodle's hair quite the way I like it. We don't give her a typical poodle cut, so most other groomers get kind of confused and end up just doing whatever. I got a recommendation for Clean Cut Mobile Pet Grooming from someone I met at a dog park. Her cockapoo looked so precious, so I looked them up on line and gave them a call.

I had never used a mobile grooming service, but the convenience really cannot be beat. They arrived when they said they would and everything from scheduling and noting what I wanted was extremely professional. Best of all, they really listened to me and my dog looked just the way I wanted her to.

The groomer was so nice and obviously very skilled. Not a single uneven spot or any complaints. we will definitely be scheduling another appointment very soon.</Text>

Did a great job with my dogs. Last time I took them to another groomers my big dog, whom is very friendly, was afraid to go in! Moe made her very comfortable and she was very calm. My smaller dog, whom is afraid of everyone, seemed unafraid and even calm!< /review>

<Review>So my rescue cocker spaniel Kirby is a seasoned escape artist, and he's not trusting of strangers. Groomers in the past have found it difficult and stressful to tame his ferociousness let alone his fur.
This is why he looked like a lion for so long poor baby. It's getting hot so I had no choice I had to
Trim his fur.

. I wasn't expecting much other than them coming to me.  it's just my dog, he's an angel but he's nuts and determined to remain stinky!

But somehow his doggie -A.D.D wasn't an issue.He was trusting and submissive with the groomer who was very friendly and knowledgeable in breed specialty cuts.

They brushed his teeth and out little bows on his ears, they cleaned his ears very well. Anyone with a spaniel knows how much maintenance those floppy ears can be.

I highly recommend these guys if they could
Groom my pretty- much -Farrel- spaniel, quickly, come to me, and at a competitive price?? Yeah I'm
Breaking up with the old groomer.

And my car won't smell like wet dog from the ride home anymore!!<//Review>< Pictures>

Great place to get a real haircut Tyler is an amazing craftsman lol when it come to classic and modern and everything in between cuts; he will always greet you when walking in to shop and listens to what you have to say and is always on point. You want a cut go to him.< /Review>

I am super happy with the personal care my two dogs received at Clean Cuts. My pups were happy amd relaxed when I picked them up. Their cuts were sharp looking and their coats soft and shiny. They were was referred by a friend from the Encino dog park and I am very happy to pass along my positive experience.  5 STARS.<//Review>

When we got home we noticed this cut on his back leg covered with skin glue. We called and we are told he had a curling nail into his back lateral  paw and in the process of cutting it got a little cut open. He apologized  for not letting us know when we picked him up. Today 2 days after, our dog licked  the skin glue out and we can see the cut clearly  and it is not close at all to the nail. To us it seems the cut happened to the back of paw while cutting his fur.< /Text>< time>

< Review>
Super sweet lady but my eyebrows were a mess after. I think she was scared to wax too much. There was still hair in between my eyebrows & basically looked the same as when I walked in. I didn’t want to complain because they were so nice. I had to clean them up myself when I got home. Won’t be going back.<//Review>

< review>
Very nice people here, the place is small but the prices are fair, I went to have my eyebrows tattooed. They looked good until they started to heal and they weren't shaped properly. I went back in and again, same thing, but as the colors faded they looked more and more maroon as I wanted a realistic feathered brow, not just a little black line. I wound up going to my actual tattoo artist who was able to fix them... permanently.<//review>

Great service!  Same day appointment, amazing threading and waxing job!  I have super sensitive skin around my lower lip but my skin did not break out from the waxing, for the first time ever!  My eyebrows were shaped too and they did a wonderful job!  Not too thin, not too wide!  Thank you ladies for making me feel beautiful!!</Text>

I expect more from this place. When I first walked in nobody even acknowledge me, yes they had clients but still no "hello, or will be with you in a bit." was sitting there for about 10 minutes. Helen did my brows good! The chairs though are very uncomfortable left with my neck hurting not even exaggerating will not be going back.< /Review>

They are so unprofessional when it comes to appointments. They never follow their own appointment schedule so I do not see the purpose of making one. I guess they have one less customer cause I am never going back.<//review>

Super kind and helpful. I was rushing to send some work off near closing time and employees allowed me to stay and ship my things. They let me borrow a pen to write the addresses on my packages. Thank you!< /review>

I made an appointment here for my daughter’s passport. I have to admit that I had the best experience applying for a passport here. The lady who helped us was beyond wonderful and professional. We were in and out within 5 minutes. I used to go to Berkeley to get passports because you can’t get an appointment here in Fremont, but I am so glad I was able to book my appointment my here. I definitely recommend USPS Newark for your passport services.</text>

Everyday we dont receive our mail before 6pm if we're lucky. If by chance its delivered earlier it's only a few pieces then the next day there is about triple the mail. What is going on? The postman that delivers Marsten Dr & Byington Dr mail has been lacking in doing his job normally. Everyone in the neighborhood are fed up.  Can someone follow up on the postman in Newarkcalif?<//Text>

< Review>
The post office is one of the newer ones in the areas but in an off-beat location.  It does its job for the Newark area.  However, it is more of a convenience to visit the one in Fremont.  Usually, I’ll combine my trips with other errands, therefore, the ones in Fremont are more convenient.  I miss the days, when the Newark post office was on Main Street of Thornton Avenue.</Review>

<Review>I receive outstanding customer service at this site. I went 25 minutes prior to closing to resolve an issue with my passport application and Zela (post office clerk) went above and beyond to help me resolve it. I can't thank her enough.< /Review>< name>

<Name>Mel L< /Name><text>This office does not have the self serve postage machine that can weight your letter or package for exact postage, or if you want to buy stamps and not wait in line.  So, I waited in line )to get postage for my state income tax filing) where only 1 of 3 postal workers could help me.  One was busy with a customer.  The second was just chatting with a customer while the computer was rebooting.  The third was only handling drop-off and pick-ups only.

Finally, I was helped and the postal worker was very nice.  I asked about the self serve postage machine.  She said the higher ups decided that the average wait time was under 5 minutes so this office does not need it.

These machines are great if you want to get in and out fast and for hours when the post office is not open.

Perfect example of government inefficiency, waste, and just plain stupidity.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I highly recommend this post office.  (We ship antiques all over the country and ship internationally 1 or 2 times a week)  I've found the staff to be reasonably efficient, very thorough, helpful and courteous.  I always go in around lunch time and there can be a bit of a line but typically at least 3 cashiers are staffed and they work efficiently.  Among the cashiers, Raj Mahal (cool name!) is worth mentioning.  He is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  Frank, if I remember his name correctly, is also very patient and helpful.  Everyone has been great though.</review><pics>None</pics>< name>

The lady at the Newark office was super friendly, greeted me warmly, and processed my request quickly. The friendliness was hands down the best among all the offices I visited in the past year and I'd say I was nicely surprised.

I hope USPS could employ more clerks like her.<//Text>< user>

<review>I love our Newark Postal Office and the wonderful employees there. Even when the are long im always greeted with a smile and return the gesture. Holidays are a mess at any post office in America people! I wish people would stop complaining or stop sending packages if they dont like the wait!!<//review>< pictures>

I have ALWAYS had great service here and when they were on Thornton. Maybe because I actually treat the Postal workers the way I want to be treated. With courtesy and respect. Have there been issues on the past 20 years? Yes. But they've been my issues; wrong zip code, no zip code, forgot to put a stamp on, etc. And lines are a part of life, still beats sitting in traffic!</Review>

< review>
When we applied for passports, we provided copies of our birth certificates as per federal instructions. However, the post office lady misinformed us and said that we had to submit originals with the copies and that our originals would be returned to us. SHE WAS WRONG! Now, we have no birth certificates for our Real ID applications. New certificates cost $40 each (including notary). This caused a two-month delay in my son's driver's permit and behind the wheel lessons. DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATES!< /review>

A lady walks in at 4:59 with three kids beside her and a large package and the Latino looking man tells her they are closed, really!!. You have no heart man, she had three kids with her!! The supervisor here never smiles, always speaks in an aggressive tone to the customers. I would recommend this place to nobody, don't bring your kids here. go to dusterberry, they're open late and much more friendly. And they have a kiosk, this place is always busy and the workers here are very slow and misplace your mail.</Text>< date>

Liberally returns official mail and packages causing me to have lost almost a thousand dollars in the last half a year. If you don't pick up your packages from the mail box on the same day, your packages will be opened without fail. Happened to all my packages I left at the mail box over night.</text>

Could kick myself for not having stopped in sooner. Don't judge on the outside appearance (my mistake)! The menu is expansive and loaded with healthy options. My lunch today - comprised of a club sandwich and watermelon smoothie - is so fresh it tastes like all the ingredients were harvested in the past 72 hours. The sandwich is freaking huge! I will be taking some home for dinner 😅 Service was friendly and prompt.<//text>

I absolutely love the food!!! The açaí bowls are absolutely divine. So rich and creamy and the perfect consistency. I also tried the tuna sandwich which was nothing short of excellent. Can’t wait to try more yummy foods here!!!!</Review>

I got an acai smoothie with OJ as recommended by the last reviewer , absolutely loved it!!!

Last week I got a small acai bowl and added PB, it was also very delicious and just the perfect size.

This is my new go to spot!< /review>

second or third review... I cannot stop raving about this place. This place has the best smoothies (way better than Jamba juice or the other spot next to F45). Easy location between both gyms on University ave, try their Spinach wrap, and lentil soup.. the menu here is huge, and servea every healthy junkie needs existing. Clean and well maintained front room, with an open kitchen area. Try their detox challenge, and the choco monkey smoothie<//Review>

Hands down, BEST SMOOTHIE SHOP IN TOWN, AND POSSIBLY ALL OF USA. PSA - please go and experience the smoothies, the food, the juices and the bowls. Choco Monkey FTW, and any and all smoothies will be wonderful. This place has plenty of seating, and conveniently located near F45 gym. 10/10 would recommend for a quick bite< /Text>

Always love this place. Fresh and a good value. If I had one wish that would be that it be organic. I'd pay more for that.</Text>

Got a free cup of juice here for my birthday!

The serve staff served the juice with a smile. They even told us how to sign up online to get the free juice. Friendliness win

The juice came quickly. Was served nice and cold with lots of real fruit bits. Nice.

Definitely stop by whenever you have a chance!<//text>

This is hands down my favorite sandwich shop in San Diego... had someone new make my sandwiches today who was lacking in his use of mayo causing them to be dry which was a bummer..... BUT... If you're wanting to try a new spot Liv Hillcrest is the place... order a veggie with turkey added or just say you want a veggie Rhonda's way 😁</text>

Really good service and so much more than a juice bar. Though they have a huge selection of juices, you are always welcome to create your own concoction. The food is outstanding. I appreciate the sincere focus on health, not just a trendy place. Parking in the rear makes it a done deal in this busy neighborhood.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>This juice place is probably one of my favorite things about living near Hillcrest. They make juice to order, so if you want to try a concoction you conceived  and don't want to go to the store or pull out the blender. They also have a lengthy list of options they have come up with. It's not the cheapest juice shop, but you get what you pay for. They also have some good food staples to rely on. The soups are filling, I usually get the lentil soup, and they have an assortment of wraps and sandwiches. Be warned their fruit bowls come with cottage cheese, so if you are ordering it to satisfy a sweet tooth, it may not be what you are looking for.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This place is the real deal. They do not stuff their smoothies with ice and sherbet. Only fresh, high quality, ingredients here. I highly recommend this place!<//Review>

I highly recommend this place. They have a great variety of healthy juices with fresh ingredients. It's clean and has friendly service.

I love to support a movement of healthy living and bright spirits!! This place offers both!<//Text>

Last time I was in I called an order so I could pick up and have enough time to eat it on my 30 min lunch. I went to pay and they hadn't made my food yet, so I had to wait another 7 minutes while they made it. wasted half my lunch there. Never stopping by again, not worth it.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Probably the best acai bowl in town, but then again there's not really any competition. This place is always packed full of people, and the wait can be pretty long to get your food. Service is slow and not particularly friendly, especially given it's a healthy joint.

Lots of juices and smoothies to choose from, not much sandwich selection- although the ones they have are large portions and are tasty.

Parking on University is a pain, but lucky for you there's parking in the back.</review>

I go to LIV for the great Acai Bowls.  It is difficult to find acai bowls in this area of town, so I'm glad they have them.  The guys behind the counter are always nice and prompt.</Review>

Hillcrest Sandwich Co. on Fifth has competition. This place makes amazing sandwiches but on top of that they have over 30 natural fruit cocktail juice smoothie things that are SIMPLY OUTSTANDING.<//Text>

<text>LIV juice bar never fails to impress, every new menu item I try blows me away. Delicious juices, big fat sandwiches, and AMAZING pitaya and acai bowls. I always feel like I'm getting my money's worth here. When you tip regularly they treat you right :)  The employees are always pleasant, kind, and timely. I send everyone I know to eat here it's one of my favorite places to eat in San Diego!!! Keep it up LIV you guys are the bomb!!! Wish I could give more than 5 stars seriously even writing this review makes me want to go back and order for the second time today it's SOOO F***ING GOOD!!!<//text>< pics>

Went on mother's day to pick up some Vape juice. While I was there I received a call from my mom and the worker was cool enough to turn the music down so i could talk to her! Great products, prices and service. I'll definitely be going back.< /Review>

Absolutely awful place to do business-business transactions with. You will not get product requested, and the Juice Joint will steal your money. I did a transaction with the business back in January, and I still have not heard a response from the owner Nate.

I would highly recommend going through another business such as Vape Street. The product there is of a better quality, and you'll actually get a call back when shipment is delayed or unavailable.<//Review>

I love this place, a little family-owned coffee shop!  Coffee is 1000X better than $tarbucks and the like, and they have fresh croissants, pastries, sandwiches, etc.  Really like the local vibe.< /Text>

Hands down my favorite coffee spot in the conejo valley. The staff are always friendly, the coffee is amazing, and there are so many options for those with dietary restrictions. Friendly vibe and comfy, oversized seating, but also a great outdoor area if you want some fresh air.</review>

The morning I went in, the owner had opened up about 15 minutes early. He was incredibly sweet and customer oriented. I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese on an onion bagel, 2 croissants, and a strawberry/banana smoothie. Everything was absolutely delicious! He has a huge coffee selection, and hasn't changed his price in the 15 years he's been in business! I'll definitely be back!

Support small businesses!<//review>

This coffee place has been around for at Least 15-20 years yet I'd never been. I met a friend here this weekend and it's a great place. The nook in the back with couches and a little library is so peaceful. The drinks are fairly priced and the service was quick and friendly.</review>

Cute local coffee place owned by locals! They support the local community and have some broad options in drinks, not just coffee. Check them out for sure!< /Review>

I've driven past this place for years during my workday without ever being able to stop. As I was in the area on a day off, I stopped to finally get my gelato with a coffee, $7.20. So disappointing! The coffee was so so but the vanilla bean gelato was freezer-burned with ice crystals throughout. I will continue to drive past. :(</text>

I love that place. We're enjoying coffee ☕️ and breakfast burritos here since 2006. It's alway's a little bit like coming home to Shehab.</text>

Im always looking for coffee shops that get away from the starbucks vibe. It had a really calming and relaxing environment, and their food is savory. I didnt try their coffee, but my husband (who is so picky about his coffee he can tell if it's been sitting out for a while or if it's fresh)  loved it. I also recomend the italian sub, its good even for breakfast.</text>

As always, this place not only has great food but exceptional customer service. I don’t see how others can give this Corner Bakery in Burbank negative reviews when the people here have always treated us customers with care and genuine concern. Thank you for employees like Giselle and Judith who always welcome the customers and always see to our needs and go out of the way to accommodate us. Keep up the great work!!!!< /Text>

The staff is very friendly,  the location is clean and cozy.  The food is delicious and I love  that u could get breakfast all day.  The banana foster pancakes are my favorite. I usually use the coupons that they give u when u sign up to receive emails from them. It's a great value.< /Review>

If you are craving a piece of beef done right - this is definitely the place to go. They basically just do beef and they do it well.

The don't do anything exciting or out of the ordinary with their menu. It is a good old fashioned steak house - evident from the food down to the decor.</review>

<rate>4<//rate><review>Love Corner Bakery, especially their mocha truffle coffee.

The issue was that when I ordered my large coffe, pretty much 1/3 of the cup was empty, my friend's coffee as well and she ordered a small 😬. We realized until back in the car. I've gone to plenty Corner Bakery and it doesn't happen.

It was good though.<//review>< pics>

Cheddar broccoli soup every time- if they have bread bowls, even better. Hand pies currently not available, but the blueberry is delicious when they have them. Breakfast entrees also really good. Sandwiches not my favorite but ok.< /Review>

I was a little disappointed with my meal at Harris'. I had the Harris Steak and my wife had the Bone-in Ribeye. My wife really enjoyed her steak but the Harris Steak, although cooked perfectly medium rare, was too bland and not seared enough for my taste. The restaurant is nice and the staff is perfectly attentive but the meal fell a little short.<//text>

< review>
Visited here with my boyfriend on a Saturday during COVID for breakfast. They do patio dining as well as takeout or delivery. They have plenty of parking right next to the cafe. The place was clean and you could see hand sanitizer wherever you turn your head to lol. Customer service was really good, it was our first time so they didn’t rush us and actually helped us picking items. Food was really good as well. We ordered Chicken Pomodori Panini and Cheddar Broccoli Soup. With bottled orange juices (since they didn’t have freshly squeezed) and a coke. And they gave you complimentary chips on the side. The panini’s were really good, not too heavy nor too light. One of the best I’ve ever had. Definitely will be back. Thank you.</review>

<review>Wow. I wanted to celebrate a personal victory and this restaurant ruined my breakfast.   They use sub standard sweeteners and oils in their desserts. So be aware. They refused to fill my order and cancelled my delivery after a long delay.  If this cafe closes permanently, will not be a loss and they probably deserve it.   No explanation was offered...if they were out of an item on the menu ? And shame on grub hub too.<//review>< UserId.>

Always a great place for lunch or dinner. I haven't tried breakfast yet, but their menu looks incredible. I love the pastas, the salads and on occasion, some sweets. Prices are very reasonable and there's usually a twofer deal.<//review>

Very excellent, the first very excellent place to get burger, I'm very impressed, It's a little bit pricey but, it's worth every penny..

Cooked to your choice... love the combination of Strawberry and bacon and blue cheese, I'm not a big fan of blue cheese but the burger I got change that.... Corner Bakery Cafe<//Review>

< Review>
Service is great. Food is good. They have healthy options like carrot sticks instead of potato chips or cup of fruit instead of hash browns. I specially like their pancakes. They're light and fluffy. It's a good place for breakfast, lunch or brunch but they stop serving hash browns with breakfast dishes at some point in the morning (11, I think)<//Review>

<Review>The cashier was so friendly, patient and polite when I needed him to repeat the options I had with my selection. He provided top quality customer service, he even came by while I was eating to check whether I needed anything additional to make my meal better. Truly a pleasant experience, not to mention the chicken pomodori panini was scrumptious.<//Review><userid>100939034417337947455< /userid>< Pics>

I love Corner Bakery.
I make a point of finding them for lunch or breakfast or whatever any place in Cities I travel to.

They make good things that are staples and really tasty.

Absolute favorites are coffee cake and the crescent breakfast sandwich.

I would probably vote them as my favorite food franchise in the United States.<//review>

I was really disappointed with this Corner Bakery. Food was mediocre, staff was inattentive, the place smelled like dirty mop water, and trash on the floor. I like corner bakery but this location needs major help.</Text>

Placed my order without any issues and the food was ready in less than 10 minutes.  The best part was not having to endure the typical long lines.  I didn't wait more than 30 seconds before my order was placed. Now that is excellent service.< /Review>

Jeison greeted us with a smile, and made us feel very welcomed. He gets 5 stars! Great service, good food. Am addicted to the pancakes with whipped butter. Only reason for 4 stars was my bacon was half crispy/half flappy (taste was spot on regardless).<//Text>

Great idea: Counter service with wait staff assistance! Numerous selections of sandwiches, soups, bakes goods, soda beverage bar. Easy to order to-go meals with a seating area while you wait; shorter waiting time by ordering ahead. Although no longer living in the area, we went there fairly frequently.</Review>

One of my FAVE spots in Burbank! Best, lightest, fluffiest pancakes EVER! An incredible IN HOUSE sugar free syrup. The turkey, avocado, bacon sandwich is NOT to be believed. And a server named Jordan that gives new meaning to the word: SERVICE w/terrific attitude! All this AND they routinely mail out coupons for BOGOs and discounts every month or so! If u haven't been there: TRY IT!< /review>

Worst experience I have ever had. Completely ruined my lunch and my day. Ordered a chicken pasta dish and made it clear I do not want any bacon in it.

Plate comes out and notice right away there are bits of bacon in my food. They seem to use the same utensils for all food or they are just extremely careless and disorganized????

I am highly allergic to bacon and this could have been very bad. Manager refunded my money but I can assure you I will never return and we will never order corporate meals from this location again !<//Text>

Quick and great service. Parking lot is quite small and definitely packed at lunch time. The food is good and reasonably priced. I prefer to use coupons when I can.</review>

Waited 30 minutes for overpriced food. Manager refunded my money after I presented my ticket showing i waited over 30 minutes.  Waited another 10 minutes after he said the food was on him and apologized.  I eventually left after 45 minutes. Will not come back or recommend to anyone.  He had no problem sending us elsewhere with an attitude. Thanks Chip for not caring enough.  Not to mention my order was vegetarian no grilling involved.</review>

<Review>The food here is generally very good, although the portions are a bit small.  I'm addicted to their chicken tortilla soup.  The place is generally pretty quiet though it can get very busy at lunchtime.   The service is pretty good.   They really try and accommodate your requests.</Review><userid>104094040725663861503<//userid><Name>Jupiter Manteca< /Name><pics>None< /pics><gmap_id>0x80c29544593ae011:0xb932ded769d0cafe</gmap_id>< Time>

<Time>1433831081896< /Time><rate>3< /rate><review>I've passed by this place several times uninterested. Yet, one night I decided to patronized it since I was seeking something healthy relative to everything else in the Burbank-town square. While it offered healthy options and the food was enjoyable for the price range, it was not as healthy as I envisioned. Customer service is what you would expect at a mainstream dining establishment. Associates are welcoming and I have witness them go beyond the scope of their duties to accommodate customer's concerns.

Overall, this place is good for pretty much casual dinning at any time of the day. I gave it a three because I am still ambivalent towards going back. It's one of those places you can live without outgoing, yet missed it from time to time.<//review>< pics>

<review>Sometimes good, sometumes bad. They have a good amount of millennials that aren't always the fastest, or sharpest bunch of kids. They don't have a lot of customer service skills checking order. The one gal had noserings and red ends on her hair, both things on millennials that i dont appreciate. Definitely need more leadership from management on how to be helpful, astute and attentive to the customer and their needs. I would like to say this was a one time thing just on my visit. Butit's been pretty frequent.</review>< user_name>

< Review>
Decided to go down memory lane last night by giving Corner Bakery a try (I used to eat lunch there all the time a few years ago and loved it). Unfortunately, "then" seems to be light years better than "now". And I'm not just talking about the food either—from the moment I walked in, the entire place smelled like a clogged toilet, no joke. I saw a few people walk in behind me, cringe and leave.

Once I ordered "to go" and sat down waiting for my food, it gave me enough time to just sit and observe everything that was different from "then" and "now". For starters, the majority of the staff (including what appeared to be the manager) seemed less professional and less service-oriented. A few of them—including the manager—were joking around, laughing and yelling at times. There was trash on the floor in the kitchen, empty boxes all over the place and it just looked dirty. Same with the soda fountain bar—dirt on the floor with wrappers and spilled drinks on the counter.

After about 10 minutes, my food was ready so I got up and headed home.

And just to conclude this bad experience, they forgot my soup and the food wasn't even that good.

Not sure what the deal was here; whether it was just bad management or if this was a larger sign of CB going on it's way out.  What I do know is I won't be going back to that CB anytime soon.<//Review>

The food is just ok. Also I wait at least 20 minutes every time for them to bring the food to my table. Sometimes my food is ready they JUST forget to bring it. Just 10 minutes ago from the time I'm writing this, I was there and as usual the food is late and when they bring my food I see a peace of hair in my eggs, plus the avocados look like they bin chewed up and spat in my plate. The Hummus it looked like from 3 days ago. I asked for a refund the MANAGER came to apologize trying to act cool by TOUCHING A PERSON, A SLAP ON THE SHOULDER WITH the back of his Hand. I told them to charge me for the coffee only a small cup. i payed cash $20 he brings me back $13 online so that means he changed me $7 for a small cup of coffee. THIS IS THE BURBANK LOCATION.<//Text>

I am writing to make a serious complaint about your store in Burbank, CA .  I went there on Monday Veterans Day 11/12/18 @ 1020am with my family and we always go to this store since its closet to home.  We had movie tickets around the corner so we wanted so breakfast.  I ordered the following: Pancake breakfast w/eggs & bacon
BBLT Breakfast sandwich
Cinnamon Roll
Pumpkin Spice Mini Bundt Cake
3 drinks.

The first problem is your cashier taking the order was not paying attention and i had to repeat myself twice for everything not to mention she was yawning the whole time while ordering.

I paid for the order got my table buzzer and 3 drink cups and sat down with my wife and 10yo daughter.  20 minutes went by and i saw people the ordered ahead of me and after me getting there food.  So i went up to the counter and there was another lady working back of counter with the rude cashier and i asked where my order was?  I could see my pancake breakfast was sitting up ready to go out under the heat lamp but no sandwich at this time i was told we are still waiting for your sandwich and then both ladies ignored me and walked away.  Why wouldnt they have given me my pancake breakfast and both items that are pre made at that time, so i went back and sat down.  10 minutes later i went back up and still my pancake breakfast was still sitting there and when the lady at the counter asked the cooks for the sandwich they shrugged there shoulders like they knew nothing about having to make a sandwich (very odd!!!).  I usually dont make a big deal in a restaurant but this day being veterans day (as i am one) and out with family and the rudeness of the staff at this store I immediately asked for a full refund on my order and left with a very bad taste in my mouth about future visits to corner bakery especially that one.  On another side note, the rude cashier that was ignoring me, yawning and not helpful at all was behind the manager during my refund laughing because i was mad.< /text>

The food was good, but the waiting time to get my order   was about 15 -20 minutes just for a family of 4, and it wasn't crowded at all, the cashier couldn't handle properly a transaction of a gift card and credit card, so the manager has to get involved, also the same cashier girl didn't know the difference between a cinnamon cream cake and a cinnamon roll.< /review>

it's always tricky using a new place for a business lunch.  I ordered lunch the day before.  I did my due diligence, I called to ask if they delivered to my area - zip code. the girl said yes.  great, i'll get everyone's order and call back at the end of the day.  so everyone's gone, I place the order and she says "oh no, you have to order off the catering menu for delivery" are you kidding me?  Everyone's gone for the day.  No time to change restaurants.  that info would have been helpful when I initially called.  I place the order, drive from LA to Burbank to pick it up and the ORDER IS WRONG.  Makes me look bad and now I have a pissed off executive who will never trust me to get it right again.  the one person who is type AAAAAAA to the extreme.  Are you kidding me?  I tried to take their survey. which by the way doesn't work.  X marks the spot on Corner Bakery.  they hire these young people who are not focused, talking so fast you can hardly understand them and they don't repeat your order or understand what it means to get someone food order wrong.  X marks the spot.  the execs said we're never using them again.< /text>

Top quality food.  Food is actually cooked onsite instead of just assembled.  The pasta, sandwiches, and salads are all really tasty (pesto cavitappi, chicken pomadori, and ceaser are my 3 favs).<//Review>

This is the second time that I encounter cutlery that is dirty. The guy eating next to us got a spoon that was dirt too. When we asked for another fork, the manager didn’t seem to think it was a big deal that the fork was not clean.< /Text>

Plus there is another Taiwanese place that sells street food. Great food restaurants, I also used the bathroom which was very clean.  I want to go again and get more food from all the places and check out the clothing stores. This will be a go-to place each time I visit San Francisco.</review>< pics>

Great mall to take the family to on a cold and rainy day.... However, beware that certain stores (i.e. Target) is not connected to the main mall so you'll have to walk outside to get to one another.  The mall underwent an extensive renovation a few years ago, and is much more modern and welcoming now, with new stores, cafes and even an Apple retail store now.< /Text>

Other than missing Tower Records, Nordstrom and my favorite cafe in their basement area, the Good Guys and Macys. Stonestown Mall is still my go to place to unwind.

I love the fact that they are opening Kura Sushi very soon where the Banana Republic used to be and I can't wait to watch a movie (when everyone is hopefully vaccinated 100%) in their new theater and grab a sandwich or two from the newly opened Whole Foods Store.<//review>

<Text>Enclosed mall filled with fast fashion clothing and fast food outlets -  infamous for rapid depletion of non renewable resources, high greenhouse gas emissions, and the consumption of massive amounts of water and energy. Often inundated with students from SFSU and nearby middle and high schools. Large multiplex theater under construction at north end should open after Covid restrictions are lifted. Plenty of parking; located on SFMTA bus (28) and light rail lines (M).< /Text>< gmap_id>

Super interesting & fun. Next time I want to spend more time in this shopping center.   I loved how organized the store was and how spacious this shopping center.  The customer service was so kind and polite when I ask for a direction because I was kinda lost in this shopping center.  I was happy when they were willing to help me.<//Text>

<Review>I first wanna start off with saying that this Mall has been a Mall that I've been going to my whole life with my family. It's always been a good experience but the last time I was there it really left me in awe and I won't be returning. I don't know what hiring process management makes security go through but it definitely isn't professional. I was at this mall around 7:30PM on the 22nd with my father who's a senior and with 2 kids and my 7 year old son who's autistic. We were getting ready to head out until my son went upstairs so We followed him up to take the other escaltor since it was closer to our car and an African American security guard started screaming at us from downstairs and followed us up & got extremely close to us, way closer than 6ft and came at us in an extremely hostile, angry & intimidating manner as if we did something wrong? Not only did he use vulgar language in front of my kids but he used intimidation tactics and appeared like he was ready to lay hands on my father. Not only was this behavior incredibly inappropriate to do to a family but I believe this man already had an issue with us beforehand because we weren't the only ones upstairs trying to make our way out but he indeed TARGETED us! This entire experience was incredibly traumatizing not only for me but for my kids and especially my son who had a meltdown because of this man following us around & being all up in our faces. Security guards aren't put in malls to police people or to cause fear on people! they're there to secure the safety and this man wasn't securing any safety! if anything he was making US feel extremely UNSAFE. I will be following up with this and will be writing other reviews on every other page I can. I am incredibly disappointed in Stones town for employing people like this. People like this with no social skills or customer service manners should not be employed at shopping centers. The mall isn't the street or the "hood" it's a shopping center where people come to have a good time and shop.< /Review>< Rating>

It is now fully enclosed and fill with exciting new stores on two levels and is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours shopping or window shopping. One of the new additions to the Food Court on the second level is Ike's where sandwiches rule. Order a celebrity sandwich or made your own from all the fixings you desire. I ordered the Matt Cain on sourdough and added everything that was not charged as an extra. It was good and cut in half to share with your special friend. Unfortunately another flag store Nordstrom is shuttered for good.

Great place to shop and everything is available. The prices are high, but normal in San Francisco. I visited when I was a student at San Francisco State University and found many great products. Always sign up for their free memberships at the stores, they have discounts and birthday gifts or coupons.</review>

I went on a weekday right before they closed at 7pm. Only a few stores were still open, and most people were at the eateries.  Good time to shop, no lines and very few people.<//Text>

<review>Parking isn't the best, but I really enjoy Starbucks here.  Jasmine will remember your name on your second or third time coming in and Christian is always friendly and will go the extra mile for you.

This is a nice place for shopping, food, drinks, etc.  It is easily accessible by public transportation with bus stops right outside.  If you drive, there are plenty of indoor and outside parking spaces available.

You can find a lot of shops here such as Apple Store, Target, Trader Joe, H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, Victoria's Secret, among a total of 100+ stores.

There is also a good selection of restaurants and specialty food stores for lunch and dinner, ranging from McDonald's to Olive Garden.  Now there is a huge selection of drinks to go from coffee, latte, frappuccino, milk teas, and many Asian specialty drinks which will take you many visits to try all of them.</Text>

Relatively smaller mall with limited retail outlets. Plenty of parking. There's a Farmer's market on Sundays usually near it.< /Review>

<text>Very beautiful place indeed. I was in a coma for over 5 months and recently woke up. I was very hungry so I came to my favorite mall to grub. On my way there I was harassed by other people in the area and they were saying such peculiar things as “put a mask on” and “stay at home”. It was very mean but as I arrived it seemed as though there weren’t as much people around and business seemed slow. Nonetheless I walked in and went to my very favorite place, Panda Express. I assumed I came too early yet I was hungry so I couldn’t help myself but eat. A security guard found me rummaging through the supplies and I was arrested on the spot! Some people!< /text><rating>2<//rating><user_id>108054487465809521614< /user_id>< gmap_id>

<review>Stonestown Galleria is a good mid-size shopping mall with a fairly good public transport access via the M-Tram and several bus lines. There is a movie theater, several sit-down and fast food restaurants and a good variety of retail outlets. It's good to have mid-sized Trader Joe's Market here too.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>Lots of chain stores, a few local ones as well. Indoors, feels spacious and open. A little hard to find your way around though there are a few maps posted. Groceries, banks, shoes, clothes, jewelry, cafes; lmost anything you need or want, you could spend your whole day here. Plenty of outdoor parking as well as a parking structure.< /review>< pics>

<text>My older sister and I get all our Note 9 gear at Stonestown ATT store. The food court caters to those who like Asian food and I'm so happy about that. I am looking forward to the holiday decorations. Stonestown is like our "town center" in this area of San Francisco.</text>< Date>

This place has some nice shops for kids and adults. The layout of the mall is very straightforward and there are maps everywhere if you are looking for something particular. The food options at this mall are better than most, as they have a few actual restaurants.</Text>

Getting in and out of the parking lot is a real problem.  As of November 2019, there's no more anchor stores. There's lots of construction, I'm certain that will continue for the next year or two.  It's worthy of a 2.5 star rating. Some stores are only accessible on the outside perimeter.<//Review>

Plenty of parking although now it's more crowded since it opened back up. Some places are open in some places are not. Restrooms are available. The selection is not very good at this mall.<//review>

It would be nice if this mall had a Macy’s again or a JC Penney or something as there’s a lot of empty space on both ends. I wish the movie theatre was connected to the mall as well instead of behind it. Overall I like this mall. It’s small and cute.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

There is a store for I think almost everyone here. It has changed throughout the years. More modern and upscale. Alot to see here! Very nice place to eat and shop!! I loved it!! There's a pizza place that actually does it all before your eyes as you wait. The PLUS in this is, the pizza is also on the healthier side with healthier crust and topping and it looks and smells soooooo good!!<//review>

< Review>
I've only lived in SF for 7 years and use to love shopping at this mall. Not anymore. Losing 2 major anchor stores while vendors seated in front of the main entrance hawking their goods. Sad what it has become. I've witnessed car windows smashed and broken into during the day by bold thieves. Mall security sure has its handful. I've had recent experience just walking outside the mall getting hassled by mentally ill or sketchy individuals who are not here to shop but loiter or harass people. I hope management looks into this and makes improvements. It has lost its positive vibe and no longer enjoyable. Too bad Stanford Shopping center is so far away...</Review>

The Mall offers some very interesting selection of foods, goods and services to nearby students and locals. For example, just for food alone, you get from Mexican to Japanese to Chinese to American, from sushi to ramen to pizza to coffee to burrito to chocolate, just to name a few. The Mall isn't all that large in terms of square footage, but it does offer a fairly good selection of shops to choose from.<//Text>

<review>It's a mall. It's busy on the best days. Add the holidays into the mix and the experience is like that of going to the DMV. The parking was designed for 1950's or 60's traffic so modern traffic puts it into gridlock during even slow hours. But it occasionally has things we need. It's good in a pinch. But stay away if you value your sanity or low anxiety.< /review>< pics>

For couple bucks you can enjoy handmade Udon noddles with the toppings you want, and unlimited free tempura cracks and green onions to be put on top of your noodles. Their other sides was also delicious that you can pick by yourself at a decent price.

<Review>This place has basically become an Asian food mall. I don't mean it as a good or bad thing. That's just what it is. About 20 different variations of Asian food you can get here. Including at least 4 boba tea places.

There are a handful of non asian food places like Boudins, Blaze, sbarro, philly cheestake, ikes, and of course Olive garden and Chipotle.

I really like the Honey Smoothie place and Blaze pizza is always nice . However if you're not in the mood for sandwiches, pizza, or Asian food you're choices are limited. There are a few new places opening that seem to also be focused on Asian food. There will be a whole foods and movie theater soon as well.

Very disappointed in the amount if electric car parking. In the entire mall there are 6 that work and I belive there are 2 more in the back that have yet to be activated. In a mall with probably 1500 spots that brings the total to less than 10 EV spots.

Anyway, this mall in convenient for the most part and you can do most of your errands in one place.<//Review>< Pictures>

Unfortunately, they have lost a couple of  department stores, like Macy's and now Nordstrom. They continue to have respectable employees and a variety of stores and shops. I just wonder how long things will last with the loss of the popular and classic department stores that customers seem to frequent the most??? It is an extremely convenient and appreciated advantage in having Trader Joe's and Target in a location that is separate from the actual "mall" itself. I also enjoy  the variety of types of restaurants that are there, anything from fast-food, like McDonald's,  a wide variety of ethnic food places, anything from Olive Garden to a couple different sushi spots and there is even a "kiosk bakery" to pickup hot, fresh, classic San Francisco sourdough bread!!!  The location of Stonestown Galleria and it's other shopping centers with all of the stores and restaurants to choose from is somewhat of a distance from the same type of places that are located downtown at Westfield Mall and not too far from  Colma with it's extremely vast variety of shopping centers, with countless shops, department and grocery stores, restaurants and just about anything else that one may possibly want or need.</Text><userid>118055818551800752254< /userid>< response>

I had been shopping at Stonestown  gallery for many years. I loved Emporium. We lost Emporium then gained  Macy's. That was a bit difficult at first. I then became a big fan of Macy's. Unfortunately Macy's has closed their store in Stonestown. I realize change is good but I can't see the good yet<//Text>

It is in a transitional phase and should be better soon. Generally a decent mall, but it could be better.< /review>

I'm here just about ever single day for the last 8 years.. 5 laps around the mall then lunch and coffee to relax. I'll stroll and look for a shirt or two or whatever else afterwards. Great that this place is a few blocks from my house. I'll walk there rain or shine.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I have started to enjoy Stonestown again. They have gotten some nice new shops. The Cream in the atrium is great and the See's is always my favorite. It is a great place to go to find stuff and not leave San Francisco because it has great shops and free parking. When you're done you can easily go chill at the zoo, beach, or lake Merced.</review>

Great shopping mall full of stores that millennials love. The most notable stops are the chains from overseas. There's plenty of parking if you drive past the parking garage. Not sure if there's AC but it was very muggy when we were there< /Review>

Definitely for the foo foo at heart!  The shops are the cream of the crop.  Needless Markup .. I mean Neiman Marcus, Burberry, Harmont & Blaine, Betsey Johnson, delicious Jimmy Choo, and ::GASP:: my fav  TIFFANY'S. So many more as well, I am not listing them all..  but you catch my drift.<//review>

<review>This is a nice indoor shopping mall. They have a large variety of brands and stores. Also, the food court is very good. It is a great option for locals do some shopping and see a movie in raining days. But also it is great for tourists who want to do some shopping before go home.</review>< pictures>

This is a bustling little Community here. There's plenty of parking and it's free. Has plenty of stuff to eat here like McDonald's and Starbucks. It's lots and lots and lots of shopping choices. From close to trinkets. I found this place very entertaining. I didn't see any kind of crime or Thug Enos at all. Very upscale. I would definitely be going back</text>

This is always upscale compared to other local malls like Serramonte and Tanforan, but I'm looking forward to the remodel since they got rid of Macy's and Nordstrom.<//Review>

I actually didn't go inside the mall I went to Olive Garden very nice people clean restaurant. Willing to help you the only thing they weren't busy so the girls are around each other talking getting their plan together for that night Patriots that were coming in to eat. I called my order in and made it has some of the stuff that I wanted which didn't make any sense because it was in the middle of the day right after lunch. I am disabled and the girl brought me over my food so I can pay for it and go on about my way she was a really sweet girl polite uniform was up to par. But I do really think this place can go for an update spruce up.<//Text>

A nice little pop-up mall, lots of store are closing to make way for newer ones, Macy's closed and it's rumored to be a whole foods later. Would recommend for a quick bite, especially the Udon place outside the main mall<//text>

Parking lot and drive ways are hazardous, food court needs a face lift and additional stores. Stonestown needs a better mix of apparel, electronic, sports and other popular retailers. The properties lay out should be engineered for a better flow that's easy for both foot and auto traffic.<//Text>

Its a great place to go to as there is many things to do. Just like any mall you got the food court and clothes/shoes section. Also Gamestop is there and Swarovski jewelry place. Also they have dippin dots for like $5 and an indoor playground for the kids. Yup its packed in there and the whole mall especially on weekends. Overall great place 10/10</Text>

I don't know why people come to this mall. It's full of stores selling junk or half empty chain stores. I've never seen a Nordstrom with that little inventory. Not for the lack of space, but lack of product. Seems like people only come here to eat.  They should just turn the whole place into a food court.<//Text>

Not a huge mall. But what it lacks in size is made up for in high density of eateries and shops. Nearly every foot is taken up by something you'll find in much larger malls. This place is very popular and has heavy foot traffic due to its proximity to several schools and transit systems. There's a movie theater in the back, but has limited showing and rather poorly maintain.< /Review>

Parking is usually a challenge and the stores tend to be crowded with kids. This is the only real mall in the area which puts a good variety of stores all within close proximity of one another.< /Review>

<text>I’ve been going to this mall since I was a baby, but it’s improved since my high school days by introducing many brands that Asian people love! For example, there are now 2 or 3 boba tea places that have lines out the door, a very popular udon restaurant, and most recently, a very popular pancake place from Japan!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDqSaJiA_UleTIxPPDyaIfCqU6WO5tH57Cb7g-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxmd-W7AZRLrRcVfPCgo61maHK59cWMrAIHVqH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808f7dba4ee0ce43:0xfd79b6f3fdc04aeb</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Robert Dolores<//user_name><Date>1507615665016</Date><Rating>3< /Rating><review>The highlights of this mall are the big name chain  restaurants in front..both very good..one is a slow sit down or a comfortable quick meal with your choice of drinks..personally like the mudslide both alcoholic & non alcoholic versions.
The other is a relatively fast food "Mexican style" restaurant.  Inside the big draw is the Apple store. The closest & biggest out side of downtown SF.  Otherwise it's a mall.<//review>< Pics>

<review>This was my second time at the Stonestown Galleria. I love all the stores they have to offer. I think the food Court could have better restaurants but my main purpose is to shop so it's really not a big deal. They have a ton of parking but it's usually really crowded.</review>< pictures>

Stonestown is a good local mall for students and people live nearby. It's got good food options and things that are essentials. For example, apple store and phone repair store, cellular companies, and department stores. I can't give it a five start because there's no good discount here. If you want to save money, go to somewhere else like outlets or look for online deals!< /Text>

Lots of stores and plenty of great eating options. The best part is the M goes right there. The parking lot is huge and plenty of space. Tone of public transport options and the university is right next door. They've their free WiFi which is annoying in reality as it asked  for email address and then you get spammed. I like that there is trader Joe's there, and Target is right next door although not as big and limited options compare to the bigger one.<//Text>

If you want to save money, go to somewhere else like outlets or look for online deals!<//Review><userid>109952324578701476089<//userid><Rate>4< /Rate><gmap_id>0x808f7dba4ee0ce43:0xfd79b6f3fdc04aeb</gmap_id>< response>

Tone of public transport options and the university is right next door. They've their free WiFi which is annoying in reality as it asked  for email address and then you get spammed. I like that there is trader Joe's there, and Target is right next door although not as big and limited options compare to the bigger one.< /Review><Response>None< /Response>< rating>

Keep shopping local there in support of your city community mall. I wonder if it will have a farmer's market there or a public market? Since Macy's is closing and what will be next there to go or shop or of  a entertainment complex to hang out and go to? Still it's not like it used to be any more of back in the days. Needs a new movie theater and events center or city services and festivals and new affordable housing and were it can be a place to go these days again.</review>

They've chased out all the good stores except Trader Joe's and Target. I don't have much reason to shop there anymore. I used to be in there a couple of times a month. Now I can't remember the last time I was inside that mall.</review>

But after graduating and moving to San Mateo, I had not gone back to that mall in many many years. When I had gone back a few months ago, it had changed a lot! Gone were Tower Records, Good Guys and even Macy's. For the retail stores here, I mainly go for the Apple Store and Express. It feels like this mall is more of a foodie destination than for retail stores as they have a great selection at the food court and outside. My favorites are Shihlin Taiwan Snacks, Marugame udon and the 85 Degrees bakery. Parking on the 19th avenue side can be tough so I go to the backside parking lot which is a little better and has less traffic congestion.</text>< pictures>

Stonestown has gone downscale.  Now that Macy's has closed and Nordstrom is also out, the mall is desperate to find paying tenants, including too many tacky stalls cluttering the hallways outside the stores.  There is a giant blinding, flashing video screen sign, which pays rent, hanging over the center of the mall and many more tacky advertisements hanging from the ceilings.  And there are over four different vendors hawking pricey boba teas and slushies.  The tables and floors in the upstairs food court are not cleaned often at all.  There are spills and food scraps on the tables and floors that go unattended for long periods of time.  Many store employees seem unhappy and don't bother to greet customers.  This is not a comfortable place to shop.</Review>

Traffic is a mother... Yeah. The basics in terms of mall offerings, with some nice extras like Trader Joe's. It's a great pit stop for those at SFSU. If you're visiting the bay area, though, maybe choose a mall outside of SF with less traffic.</Review>

It's a mall. A lot of people don't enjoy malls, but I do. And I especially enjoy Stonestown because of the wide array of people you get to people watch. The teenagers who come after school. The older generation who don't handle huge malls well. The people who rush in and rush out just as quickly. The many different shops available. This mall provides so much.<//text>

<text>A little grey on the outside, but the mall itself is actually quite nice - spacious and clean, with probably all the shops you'd expect in a shopping mall. I do think Westfield in Downtown has a better selection of stores, but Stonestown absolutely does its job.

Food options are alright, there's also a Trader Joe's on the same lot, as well as a couple of restaurants.</text><username>Sebastian Fiedler</username></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
stonestown has really upgraded in the past couple years. it really caters well to their main audience - the asian locals that live nearby. there's now a popular udon spot outside, a taiwanese snackshop inside, and a bunch of boba places (yifang has really good brown sugar matcha latte). they also have trader joe's and target.<//Review>

St. Columba is a vibrant community and charming retreat space. I have been on several day retreats and one three night stay. On my three night stay, I hiked Mt. Vision right behind the retreat house. It's 2.5 miles uphill but the views from top are spectacular! It is very welcoming to all identities and faiths. The current pastor and his partner are amazing guys. If you get to meet them (and he's not running around holding things together) defintely stop and have a conversation with him. He is very intelligent and aware.<//review>

Stonestown is good but there isn't a very good selection of stores. There are plenty of restaurants but I don't think there are enough clothing stores.  Other than that, Stonestown is very clean and it makes for a pleasant shopping experience.</text>

<Review>I used to go to Lowell HS so I would frequent the Stonestown Mall frequently. But after graduating and moving to San Mateo, I had not gone back to that mall in many many years. When I had gone back a few months ago, it had changed a lot! Gone were Tower Records, Good Guys and even Macy's. For the retail stores here, I mainly go for the Apple Store and Express. It feels like this mall is more of a foodie destination than for retail stores as they have a great selection at the food court and outside. My favorites are Shihlin Taiwan Snacks, Marugame udon and the 85 Degrees bakery. Parking on the 19th avenue side can be tough so I go to the backside parking lot which is a little better and has less traffic congestion.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7dba4ee0ce43:0xfd79b6f3fdc04aeb<//Gmap_id></record>

The Stonestown Galleria is a one stop shop for every type of shopping. They have a full food court, bakeries, and ice cream shops, Clothing stores for any preference, home decor, bedding, kitchenware, and much more. The overall aesthetic is pleasant, and the facilities are kept clean.< /text>

It's a pretty good place to shop or even just to unwind. It has good retail stores (for fashion, not so much with electronics though). Most of the stores I visit also have reasonable discounts quite often. There aren't a whole lot of food selections, but they're mostly decent. There's complimentary WiFi too.< /text>

From Groceries to clothing, Dining & weekend hangout, Stonestown Galleria has it all. We go there almost every weekend. Plenty of parking space, huge walking area and Trader Joe's on the corner, makes it one of the best shopping mall in the bay area.<//review>

Traffic is a mother... Yeah. The basics in terms of mall offerings, with some nice extras like Trader Joe's. It's a great pit stop for those at SFSU. If you're visiting the bay area, though, maybe choose a mall outside of SF with less traffic.<//text>

<Text>It's a mall. A lot of people don't enjoy malls, but I do. And I especially enjoy Stonestown because of the wide array of people you get to people watch. The teenagers who come after school. The older generation who don't handle huge malls well. The people who rush in and rush out just as quickly. The many different shops available. This mall provides so much.< /Text>< user_name>

The most interesting thing about this place, as of Q3 2016: There's a restaurant in the food court called Silk Road, and everyone there appears to be Central Asian. The owner is apparently Kyrgyz. Definitely an unexpected food adventure.< /Review>

<Review>It’s pretty much your average mall. Some of their unique highlights I would say are Blaze Pizza, CREAM, Nordstrom, Apple.

This a great shopping centre, its a real shame to see the Macy's store lose its buzz. The store looks sad and tired and from our last visit 7 years ago we never brought anything this time, really sad. Nordstrom looked great though.</text>

There's a lot of parking which is good for days when it gets busy but the mall itself is a little lack luster for some reason. I can't quite put a finger on it but it feels like a mall in a small city rather than a mall in San Francisco.<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>One of my favorite places to shop. They have a nice food court... they also have a Starbucks and a Jamba Juice. There is also an Olive Garden restaurant on the outside and there are some bakeries and pizza places to name a few. There is an Apple Store for your tech needs. There's a Nordstrom and a Macy's store and one of my favorites.... J.Jill. there is a See's Candies on the lower level and an AT&T shop on the upper level. A few hair salons too. The place is beautifully decorated around the holidays. All-in-all, a very nice place to go. :-)<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It's a mall. Not really a huge fan anyway, but it doesn't really have any stores for me. H and M has only women's clothes. Food court boring. If malls are your thing though, it's a fairly good sized place.</Review>

The parking lot is a literal war zone. I sat in my car waiting for about 15 minutes and 2 fights and 2 near accidents, and one other person that drove completely over the dividers. Its surprising how busy the parking lot it, then you walk into the mall and its dead.< /Review>

<date>1485536434220<//date><rating>4<//rating><Review>If you're sick of shopping in the city, the Stonestown Galleria provides a suburban mall atmosphere. It's convenient to public transportation, has a food court with popular restaurants, and free parking. There is a Trader Joe's. All of the stores that you expect to be in a mall are there; Victoria's Secret, Pink, Apple Store, Nordstrom, all of the typical mall shops are there.

There are signs which also promise that a Target is coming soon; that'll be a great addition to the mall.< /Review>< pics>

Small, but not a bad mall.
Parking can be difficult.

Food court upstairs, main entrance's elevator to the 2nd floor is out.

Quite a few new restaurants.

<Review>Typical mall with a food court. The big stores are Macy's and Nordstrom.  There is a store or kiosk for pretty much anything from greeting cards to calendars.  Parking can be tight in the outside lots, but there's usually a lot of spaces in the parking structure in the back.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Here's a short anecdote that conveys amazing an customer experience from the staff at this gamestop:

I had been calling in for two weeks to if they have any Nintendo Switches, which at this point are very difficult to come by.  They didn't, but said if I try coming in-store they might have them on this particular night.  So I went and no luck.  But the staff person and manager went off for a second to discuss together, and decided that they would unload the UPS package that had come in a half hour earlier, just so I could get my Switch.  They had planned on unloading it the following morning, but fast-tracked the process to accommodate me.

Super cool move.  Speaks to the friendly nature of the people at this Gamestop.  Good service is good business.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

The mall is nice and well kept with all the usual suspects you'd expect in a mall, department stores, wireless retailers, shoes, etc... Nothing out of the norm or particularly special here but it's convenient to get the necessities of you're into shopping in malls...</review>

<text>The second largest mall in San Francisco (after the Westfield Mall). Nordstrom's and Apple are the leaders here now. There has been a large turnover in recent years, many new stores (Zara among them) and more are coming this year.  There are some stores and eateries for younger population from the nearby State University, which is great. Trader Joe's is a very convenient recent addition. There are also several bakeries, some old fashioned candy stores, a food court, and the Boudin Sourdough Cafe. There is lots of parking space and public transportation close by.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Usually, say 9 times out of 10, the service @ Stonestown is faster than other ops. Occasionally, you might find yourself waiting for a sales rep to wrap up his/her table talk with another employee. This was the case @ Nordstrom this past weekend.

Traffic is horrible all the time. Macy's a longtime tenant is closing so there will be a big hole at that end of the mall. Target moved into the corner where Sports Authority & the bookstore used to be.< /text>

Pretty neat mall, has food, an apple store, Macy's and Nordstrom's. Ton's of shops I think they are around 125 shops now. There is a  Uniqlo here, they hem their pants for free. Many hours of my youth spend here hanging with friends. It's been updated on the inside a bunch but what's up with that old and decrepit Macy's sign on the exterior?</review>

I go there primarily for Trader Joes and Target.  Located off 19th Avenue, it is near freeway access.  It is served by several Muni bus lines including the 18, 28, 29, and M streetcar.  SamTrans also stop on 19th Avenue.  There is ample parking.  SF State is a short stroll away.</review>< rate>

A good little shopping center, but it can be tricky to get in and out of. I take the back entrances to both sides of the complex to avoid traffic and pedestrians. There is a wide variety of stores, and really yummy places to eat. Avoid the Regis Salon like the plague, though.<//Text>

This is a pretty nice mall with a good selection of shops and eateries.  There's a small theater located in the back, right behind the mall.  SFSU, the local library, and a Muni station are all within walking distance.</Review>

<text>I needed more Clinique make-up so I dropped in to Nordies... not exactly in and out but I conquered my goal! I like the fact that they had a big parking lot and I could also look for something I needed at Targert and purchase some Trafer Joes ready-to-eat salads. Off on my next errand!</text>< Pictures>

I prefer is over the Westfield mall because it has more affordable stores & tons of free parking! You won't have any street people druggie harassing you & your fam. It is a family friendly area. Lots of restaurants at this location. 2 gyms walking distance as well. This place isn't pet friendly.< /review><resp>None< /resp>< Rating>

I like how they have F21, HM, Sephora and about to open Zara. However, the clothing in here is not updated with the other stores. However, the food shops (blare pizza, bubble tea, quickly) in this mall are great.<//Text>

Look, this store is by a mall and it's run by college/high school age kids. I get that it's not going to be the greatest Target. But I was there yesterday 4/26 for Keurig Descaler, none in stock, which is not that big of a deal. An associate informed me that they will be in stock 4/27. Today I call the store for more than 30 minutes with no answer. Walk 20 minutes only to find out it's actually not in stock. Guess I'm buying it on Amazon where not only is it cheaper, I won't be given the run around or incorrect information. Just overall not impressed!< /Text>

It is a mall. Nothing special, but it attracts a wide range of people every day. Two issues that must be addressed are them not turning the escalators on early in the morning,  and the WiFi there is a sick joke. Otherwise,  it is a basic shopping mall with many different stores.<//review>

<review>It's okay. Don't expect to do any serious shopping. Place is really just a place for students to go eat lunch or pick up a Starbucks coffee. There lots old people around. Not sure where they come from.< /review>< user_id>

<date>1519237718030</date><review>It's a mall with all the standard mall spots - Macy's, Victoria Secret, Sephora, Uniqlo, Van's, Lush, Forever 21, Nordstrom, etc. BUT BONUS: it has a Trader Joe's. The mini Target is a major disappointment (selection is terrible). There are quite a bit of dining options beyond the food court, including an Olive Garden that gave my husband food poisoning, and various other trendy eateries that often fail and turn into different trendy eateries. There is a farmers market on Sunday between 9 am and 1 pm. Don't fight for above ground parking - the garage parking is both ample and very close to the mall entrance, plus it saves you a butt searing during the occasional hot SF day (anything over 75°).< /review><resp>None</resp>< UserId.>

Nice place to hang out.  I took my daughter as she loves SF.  We went to Tartine on Guerrero but there simply wasn't anywhere to park without a bag of quarters.  So we ordered take out.  We ended up at Peet's Coffee in Stonestown.   We ordered a tea and a coffee and sat outside enjoying our "lunch" from Tartine.  The mall itself was nice, especially compared to what it used to be back in the early to mid 80's.  Slightly more upscale than your typical mall....  Nice blend of restaurants and shops.<//review>

It has over 100 plus stores such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Foot Locker, Banana Republic, Gaps and Swarovski, etc. There's also a Trader Joe where you could do something grocery shopping at the same time. A Target is opening soon. On the weekend, Stonestown hosts the Off the Grid on Saturday and farmer's market on Sunday.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Pretty generic old school mall - like in the 80s style.
Plus for having a Trader Joes - the only place I'd go to here.< /Text>

Good mall with lots of outlets. But almost all stores that are there you can also find in San Francisco and do not go to Stonestown.<//Review>

Typical mall with mid level stores nordstroms and the ilk.  Their food court is garbage and their parking is non existent.  On a brighter note they do have a trader joes and an olive garden.<//review>

This is one of my favorite malls because it's low key with a lot of parking including multiple parking garages. The mall is never annoyingly packed and they have great stores like H&M, Victorias Secret, Nordstroms, Gymboree, etc.</Review>

But, this place actually feels really open and it has a very decent selection of stores.

Love cotton on, uniqlo and trader Joe's. Even found that they have a dmasq (SP?) that is pretty similar to a very small version of a bershka.< /Review>< Pictures>

I like this mall. It's small but has underground parking for rainy and hot days.  Has shops that Serramonte seems to not have and vice versa, so they complement each other. Also nice the M line is right in front.
Used to love coming here for Chevy's happy hour when I went to SFSU.< /text>

Where do you downgrade the mall for the horrible aggressive vendors that approach you while you're trying to wander from store to store?  The sellers can be more intrusive than the downtown homeless.  This year I thought they'd been tamed, but, no.  A smiling  woman from a shop filled with gold-looking things interrupted my journey to say "Hello" and talk to me about whatever she was selling. Ugh.

The stores (Nordstroms, Apple, Macy's, Brookstone, etc.) are great. But, those sleazy kiosks keep me from going to Stonestown except for an annual Christmas trip.</review>

If you are a true San Francisco native you have been coming here all your life. This mall has the perfect balance of stores. Macy's always has great sales and Nordstrom's has the nicest items. Aveda, Teavana, See's candy and plenty of shoe shops!< /Review>

This mall has been struggling for market share for a while. Stores come & go all the time. There not one thing that appeals to me to buy here, so even though it's relatively close to me, I wind up going to other malls. The only reason I go here is for a walk in inclimate weather.< /Review>

<Review>This mall doesn't have a lot of variety in terms of clothing stores but it's ok if you have to visit an specific store like Sephora or the Apple store. Food court is small. Plenty of parking.<//Review>< Time>

At the convergence of several bus lines (28, 28R, 29, M, and a few others I rarely if ever take, this mall is easy to get to. It also has a Nordstrom, Teavana, Boudin,  Olive garden,  sushi bar and a Giants store. There are many more stores, with something for everyone. Plenty of parking, with front and back lots, and a structure attached to Nordstrom.  There's a Trader Joe's too.</Text>

<text>Sucks. Macy's only has clothing for women close to dying age and Nordstrom is basically a spaced out version of Nordstrom Rack. Don't go to the restrooms after the maintenance staff has cleaned the floors because the make you wait 4.5 hours till the mopped floors have dried and the water in thw toilet bowls have completelt evaporated.<//text>< pics>

It has most of your standard "mall stores' but overall kinda lackluster as a mall. You are better off going to Serramonte< /Review>

Stones is located right next to SFSU and a library. Better yet there is a dedicated M Street car station right in front! Just be careful when your crossing the street please.

Once inside, you will be graced(now) with C.R.E.A.M, the ice cream sandwich booth! And then a ghiradelli to the left and a unique collectibles store! Vast variety of stores, ranging from food to jewelry to clothing. Patrons and staff are of diverse backgrounds as well!

Just to name a few: Macy's, Nordstrom, H&M, Uniqlo, Michael Kors, Apple store, Food court, and lots more.

Stonestown evolves with us.<//Text>

The decor and architecture is very pretty.  I've never had difficulty finding parking in the basement.  The selection of stores is typical for a mall.  The two anchor stores are Nordstrom and Macy's.  The food court has a decent selection.  There is also a Boudin's on the ground floor, and a cafe at Nordstroms.  This mall can get pretty crowded, because it is located right next to SFSU.</text>

I only went to the Food Court.  Very expensive and a limited choice of food. VERY NOISY and not enough seats!< /Review>

I've always come here to shop because it's the closest mall near where I live. The shops have been updated over the years to provide more diversity in what is offered for clothing, food, and essentials. You won't find all shops here, so you should check their directory if you're not sure what you need is here.

Do check out the new ice cream shop in the middle of the mall. That's probably the most prominent location since everyone passes through here. It's pretty delicious! Food court is in the 2nd floor right above it (in the middle). You'll also find Macys on one end and Nordstrom on the other end. Parking is usually decent as there are parking lots of both sides of the mall as well as an underground lot. There is also a parking structure outside of Nordstrom as well. Some additional shops are in the next street (connected by Nordstrom), such as McDonalds, Trader Joe's, and I believe Chase bank. Sports Authority *was* there as well but they are out of business now.<//text>

Stayed for an hour and when I got out my car was broken into. It was right in front of the mall and there were also security cars. Not a good experience when you are visiting from out of town.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Bad experience !!! We were on 05/22/17 and parked right in front of the entrance to the Olive Garden restaurant ... well lit ... a lot of movement ... we saw security guards hanging around ... and when we got back the car was with all the passenger glass broken and they had stolen several belongings ... it was a big loss ... stress ... we called security q just took note ... we went to the police station ... ended our tour !!! We were never robbed here in Brazil ... That was a lesson !!! Never leave your belongings in the car anywhere ...

Péssima experiência!!! Estivemos no dia 22/05/17 e estacionamos bem em frente à entrada do restaurante Olive Garden ... bem iluminado... bastante movimento...vimos seguranças rondando... e qdo voltamos o carro estava c o vidro passageiro todo quebrado e haviam furtado vários pertences... foi um prejuízo grande... estresse... chamamos a segurança q só tomou nota... fomos p delegacia... acabou com nosso passeio!!! Nunca fomos roubados aqui no Brasil... Isso serviu de lição!!! Nunca deixar os pertences no carro em nenhum lugar...< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Stone City, if you live close, you can visit it occasionally. There are not many to buy, but there is an Apple store. Pizza at the door, ice cream, and Chinese massage on the second floor are good.
