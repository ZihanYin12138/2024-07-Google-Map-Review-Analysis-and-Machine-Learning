When this place first opened it was good. Today was the last day we will ever get food there. I ordered a chicken burrito Supreme the chicken was so dry and flavorless, the burrito was filled with undercooked beans, and the tortillas was dry and crumbled. I've never had a burrito from anywhere that bad. Save your money and go to taco bell down the street!< /review>

<Review>Been going here for over a year and it has been a battle since day one. Inconsistent burritos. Subpar until I say something, then good for awhile until recently. Took back a burrito for lack of meat, more rice and beans. They remade it the same way. Waited for a week and a half, went back and it was good. Then Wednesday had a burrito that was horrible! The last almost half of the burrito was rice and beans. 15 bites with no meat! This is the last straw! I even called and left a message for Juan, the owner, and he has yet to call me back. Wish I could post a pic here. I advise to use at your own risk!< /Review>< Time>

<Review>Very good carne asada fries. Kind of expensive. Not to be rude, but I don't think the cashier should be tipped. I think the cooks should be tipped. They did a wonderful job on my food. I will want to return. Street tacos but expensive but I enjoyed my food.<//Review>< Response>

<Review>Moved across town and thought I'd give this place a try and glad i did, was hesitant at first because me and the wife where eating out on a friday night... we like to have a nice beer to go with some good tacos 👍 this taqueria doesn't serve alcohol not a big deal to some but just a note. The food was great and so was the service I've been back three times now and the food is always consistent would defently recommend. Always consistent my new spot !</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

20 Mexican resteraunts in Modesto and there the ONLY ones who don’t make an enchilada with cheese inside the tortilla ... was a frequent customer but they looked at me like I was crazy because I wanted cheese inside like Iv gotten my entire 30 years of my existence. They made it 2 times without cheese even after I brought it back the first time. WILL NOT go back after the principal of the matter . Place physically is clean tho :) terrible last experience sorry Juan</text>

The lady at the counter was very rude and didn't seem like she wanted to be there. She never checked on us to see if everything was alright. Never asked us if we needed a refill on our sodas. When she brought my kids' meals she slammed the dishes on the table and said "I dont't know who ordered what"? VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISRESPECTFUL!!. We contunued to try to get her attention, but she continued to help the other tables, which we felt was RUDE AND  WE FELT IGNORED.

NEVER AGAIN! I came in there on my lunch break. I tried ordering a RICE, CHEESE and BEAN burrito and one of the girls said that they weren't able to make that unless it's a kids meal. I said that's fine and I also added a cheese tamale. After I paid I'm waiting for my to go order and 25 minutes pass by and nothing! So I go up to one of the girls and ask if my order was ready she said it was and she'd be right back. She comes back to tell me that they do NOT have cheese tamales currently, AFTER WAITING FOR 25 MINUTES and AFTER I HAVE PURCHASED IT. She asked to switch it out for another thing, but I'm a vegetarian so I said I wouldn't be able to eat anything else. She then hands me the burrito that's only filled with beans and rice. I ask another girl " You guys can't put the rice inside the burrito?" and she said yes I then replied "Well that girl told me you guys couldn't unless it was a kids meal and you failed to do that." And the girl apologized for the other girls mistake and gave me a full refund, then had told the other girl to tell the cook to make me 2 large bean, rice and cheese burritos. I told her to forget it that I'm not waiting another 25 minutes and I had to return back to work. Overall horrible service, the waitresses are not on the same page and bad attitude. Sticking to Mis Compadres on Sylvan and Oakdale!</text>

Came for their soft opening, they have complimentary Mexican sweet bread and pink lemonade. Over all the appearance and ambiance is very pleasant. Not to mention they are super high tech. The owner Juan went out of his way to give us the ultimate experience. The salsa bar is bomb accompanied by some tasty crunchy chips. I ordered a vegetarian burrito which was yummy. My friends ordered the ceviche tostada which left him licking his fingers. The Chile relleno was delightful. My all time favorite was definitely the guacamole. Had seconds and thirds... So Bomb! I definitely recommend this new hot spot.< /Text>

The place is very clean. But the food is very nasty! I order a grill chicken taco and a carne asada taco. The chicken tasted really bad. Like it had been cooked a week ago and was re-heated. It left a bad taste in my mouth.  And the carne asada meat was really dry and salty. These awful meats where placed on two dry greasy taco shells. After one bite I couldn't stomach it and had to throw them away. You think for a really small street taco being $2.50 each. It would at least be good.</Text>

< review>
This is one of my go-to spots! I ALWAYS shop at THIS Dollar General, even when I lived in peach/olive (area). Great staff, products, PRICES. Me N Ed's (our fav pizza spot) is there, there's a bingo place- well "activity center"- THAT'S GREAT! Liquor store, bicycle shop, beauty shop, beauty supply store, tv store & repair shop, motor scooter shop...alot more honestly. It always boggles my mind- WHO goes here? Is it popular? (It should & COULD be!) I dig this center.</review>

< Review>
I enjoy this shopping center for its proximity to my home, the VERY Inexpensive grocery, clothing, household essentials, home goods, toys, OTC Medicines, make-up, shoes, hats, shower essentials, cleaning supplies, garden supplies & much more at The Dollar General. I come usually 2x per week. Also being a smoker- the liquor store has GREAT PRICES on smokes- if your not picky- 4$/pack! That's almost unheard of. Even the Casino cigarettes are about that price and increasing! Also has a beauty parlor, bingo hall, Me-n-Ed's pizzeria, and a few other shops as well. Great little shopping center with discounts to be found! & right across from the U.S Post Office😉</Review>

The shops/stores/restaurants are terrific (Butterfish - yum! - Blaze Pizza, Aqua Nail salon, a bank). The parking lot, though, is DUMB. To get to Five Guys or Butterfish in the northeast corner, you have to cut around the weird L shape of the lot, no matter which way you approach. Bad design.
Lots of room to add to this center - I'm sure it will grow.
Fix the dumb parking design, though.< /Review>

Sierra Tire and Wheel charged me a great price compared to other locations for my BMW. I was happy with how quickly the service to my vehicle was completed. I think I'll be going back to purchase four brand new tires, the quote was a  good deal as well.</Text>

I took my car here to get a alignment and they messed my car up more than it was before. If I could give them 0 stars I would. Very un professional.</Review>

Came here because my uncle recomended sierra tire after leaving tire guys 916 with a bad experience. The 2 gentlemen know what they’re doing and have good pricing. Was impressed with how quick they were!<//review>

Took both my cars here. 2004 Mazda and 2004 Cadillac. Had to wait for the parts to be ordered for the Mazda but that’s expected and they were here the next day. Very experienced and helpful. Showed me exactly what was wrong with each car.</text>

I've taken several cars here and each time the service was quick and the guys working there were experienced. Prices were very reasonable both for alignment and for tires. This has become my go to shop for everything wheel related.</review>

Hours of operations is from 9am to 6pm, a lady and I had to wait 30 minutes passed 9am to get services done. Very unproffesional. They should be open by 9am and ready to go. What kind of business is this??!!?<//text>

I called to ask questions about new tires for my truck and the guy on the phone was not very helpful infact, he got very rude with me becuase i didnt know my specific tire size, i read the size from my tire over the phone and he then got  overly frustrated and just hung the phone up in my face..i assume these guys care nothing about there customers...i guess you're either buying or flying with theys guys....<//Review>

Ive been here a couple of times and I really love the place. Everytime I go I get the "Chamango Mango" Its so good, I would recommend it to anyone. Besides the amazing drinks and the neat place, they also sell other little things such as earrings, socks, small little bags, and more.< /Review>

< Review>
Don't be intimidated by its appearance and location. This shopping center is filled with little gems like Hello Boba! You are welcomed by the busy staff, through Covid-compliant glass, wearing masks. We ordered Jasmine green tea, Royal milk tea, and the sea foam black tea. All with brown sugar boba, without extra charge. We were able to adjust the sweetness to our liking. They were allmade well, we finished them before getting back on the freeway. The boba was soft and chewy, the way they're meant to be.</Review>

This little Boba shop is a hidden gem! They have a good selection of drinks and a small area with boba related trinkets that are super cute! Also the cups are well designed and don't feel like they will break if you shake them too hard. I've been to some boba stores that have cups that cracked on me. Not a pleasant experience!</review>

The boba is SUPPPERRRR AMAZING! Like I think this is my all time favorite boba place because their boba is ALWAYS fresh! And I really dig that because I get picky with my boba! The varieties in boba is always delicious too! Even their merch is adorable! Would recommend if you are hanging out with friends to take them here! Or even with your partner take them HERE!</text>

I really enjoyed the Boba milk teas I ordered from here.

They are also offering Happy Hour prices during the week from Mon-Fri, 4pm-7pm (BOGO on Boba Milk Tea or Thai Milk Tea). They offer reg size (small) or bigger for $.50 more. Can't beat the HH deal, though.

I would've appreciated if they offered non-dairy milk alternatives for ALL of their drinks instead of just certain ones. Apparently, the mixes are already made so they cannot substitute/customize according to your needs.<//text>

Newly opened Hello Boba that offers coffee, bubble tea and desserts. They are located in a small plaza by Peck rd and Garvey avenue. They have a wide variety of milk and fruit tea boba. Interior atmosphere was welcoming and  relaxing. Inside was clean, organized and spacious. Its interior decor was simple albeit cute. Some of their milk tea boba and smoothies were pretty standard however what captivated me was their fruity selection called mojito (original, mint leaves, lime, mango, peach, watermelon). I ordered a large mojito with boba and it was really good. It is something other boba shops in SGV don’t have. It’s refreshing, perfectly sweetened and divine. The concatenated boba pearl was chewy, warm and soft just the way I like it. Prices were inexpensive and very competitive. They have regular and large size containers. Furthermore, it has positive and motivating message at the back of every containers. Staff was nice and assiduous. Overall I HIGHLY recommend Hello Boba and will definitely try their other boba.< /Text>

It really helps when an employee actually knows a store policy.  Sign on the door "Only two parties allowed in the store at one time".  We look in the store, one party of two people, we make the second party and walk in (we are not within 15 feet of anyone in the store and are wearing our masks)... lady behind the counter, You have to wait outside.  Ok, questioning the sign...  "Your sign says two parties, not two people."  Atempting to get a legitimate clarification.  Rudely, she responds...  "You have to wait outside, that is our store policy, if you do not like it, we do not need your business."   She was right, they did not need my business and we went to Doc Bernsteins (one block away).  I do not care if your policy is Two people in the store at one time, if that is what you want, that is fine...  but your sign should say that, not " Two parties", which many people will take to interpret as two groups of people together.  Simple fix, update your store sign to say "Two People".<//Text>

Well, I'm a bit of an ice cream connoisseur and trust me, the quality of the ice cream was awesome and the waffle cone was on point as well. We really enjoyed the server and she directed us to the best choices!! We had to wait a bit but great things are worth waiting for!! Would definitely visit here regularly if I lived in California...<//text>

<review>The ice cream was really good, and the place looked really nice inside. It is kind if overpriced and has small portions unless you get a large waffle cone. The only thing I disliked about the place, was one of the employees was really weird. She didn't have much if a personality, and she wasn't very helpful. I would maybe come back for  the ice cream if a different employee was working and was nicer.< /review>< UserId.>

Take your time and try all the different flavors and dairy-free sorbets. The staffis so nice and patient that they will let you try them all before choosing. Although a scoop is five bucks, the flavors are unique and impactful. It seems they draw inspiration from a variety of culinary backgrounds and they do a good job of representing those flavors. Definitely worth a try.<//review>

<Time>1612711576862<//Time><Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Bought a pint of chocolate covered strawberry ice cream to enjoy this weekend. Long story short: It was freezer burned. It was grainy and icy, super disappointing because I heard such good things on this ice cream flavor. Not sure if I'll go back, a lot of money for freezer burned ice cream. Likely the ice cream that is bought by scoop is still good. So still get a scoop but maybe not a pint.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Local review by a local:  Excellent locally made ice-cream that has great creative flavors.  They are doing a great job of being COVID-19 safe, and you order via a window in the door.  The only downsides are samples are not available so you could be stuck with something too sweet for example.  Since I am older, I tend to go with robust flavors with things like pie crust in them.  While I thought the Boysenberry was totally amazing in flavor and reminded me of the long defunct Ben & Jerry's version for decades ago, I could do without pie pieces. In keeping with simplicity, I also had a scoop of Vanilla Bean.  It was refreshing.  While they did have a single flavored Strawberry & a Complex Chocolate, I kind of missed a Coffee or a Pistachio.  There was an intriguing Lemon combo, but without sampling why risk it.  While I see the appeal for the Millennial crowd, us mature folk do enjoy the classics, so please make more of those.  IN any case, it made an excellent dessert after a big meal at Ox & Anchor around the block.  This local ice-cream was also available at the Avila Barn, where sundaes where available.  I am not sure if that is possible in the future here....I guess it depends upon this new C-19 age.  Regardless of the above, it is simply marvelous to see this wonderful venture surviving in downtown SLO, despite the many challenges. Thank you so much for all your hard work!<//Review>

What was it about the waffle cone that wasn't amazing?  We're really happy to hear how much you enjoyed your ice cream, especially the Honey & Cornbread Cookies!"}<//Resp><review>So you know when people all tell you an ice cream place is amazing, and you get excited when you go, then as you're getting your first samples you worry if it's all hype? You've had some pretty amazing ice cream before. That first taste had better be pretty spectacular, right? So even if it's some of the best ice cream you've ever had, it's not going to blow you away, and if it's in any way mediocre, you'll be flat out disappointed. That's the headspace I was in as I was handed my first taste of McConnell's ice cream on a metal spoon. I took a bite and I suddenly had my perspective on the entire concept of ice cream shifted, because it is some of the best ice cream in some of the most insightful flavors you'll ever see. Every flavor is delicious, good luck picking one.

You want to know what kind of wizards these guys are? They made cornbread into an ice cream. And it's genuinely the best ice cream my wife and I have ever had. It's so good we're getting extra to go.

My only constructive criticism is that the waffle cone is not great. It tastes just like a regular cone. But with ice cream this good you won't care. They could charge 150% as much and it would still be worth it.</review><date>1564871249832</date>< rate>

<review>They have some really good unique flavors. The prices are pretty high though, 6 dollars for the flight which is 3 very small scoops. The sizes are weird, and there's single 2 regular scoops and flight which is 3 half scoops and double which I had to ask and you can have 4 flavors. Doesn't make much sense.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The ice cream flavors at McConnell's are exceptional and well thought-out. I had grapefriut ice cream for the first time and it was surprisingly good. I shared it with someone who doesn't even like grapefruit and she asked for more!  And yet it really did taste like grapefruit!  They have the Midas touch.  The ice cream base itself is not as rich as some I've had, which is either a plus or a minus depending on your desired level if indulgence. The prices are more Big City than Small Town, so you're prepared. Enjoy!</Text>

The French Pot method reigns supreme here and it's plenty evident in the tastes and textures. Delicious flavors, solid service, fantastic location. Lines can be long, but it's worth the wait, especially when it's hot out. 2 Dedicated motorcycle parking spaces right across the street, too!<//Review>

They always have a ton of different flavors to choose from and I never get the same thing twice. There's limited seating inside but it's in a great location in downtown SLO and we've always been able to grab a seat inside. The staff is friendly and always offering different options if you can't decide which flavor to choose from.< /review>

Adding into the mix of ice cream places in SLO is McConnell's, a fine sweet delicacy from Santa Barbara. I was very surprised to see one here, but also very relieved that I don't have to drive all the way to Santa Barbara anymore. It kind of appeared out of thin air, but also just in time for finals week at Cal Poly. As ice cream prices go, it is $5.25 for two scoops (called a single scoop) and there are so many options! My favorite thing about them though are the dairy free flavors. Not many people go through the effort to make dairy free flavors and just resort to sorbets which is just sad. Overall, a great place to grab a snack or dessert after a meal!</Text>

I\'m sorry your waffle cone wasn\'t the texture you were hoping for or expecting.  We do make our waffle cones from scratch at all of our scoop shops.  Because we do hand make them, there will be some variation in the exact amount of "crunchiness," which doesn\'t necessarily mean the waffle cone isn\'t "fresh" if it\'s not crunchy - it could just be because it was cooked for slightly less time.  I would be happy to make this up to you if you\'d like to send me an email at info@mcconnells.com with your contact information.

My wife and myself each had an appointment within the last two weeks here. They're professional, respectful and the office is beautiful. Up to date equipment and techniques. They are very thoughtful thorough with their cleaning and x-rays. I recommend them to my family and friends plus anyone that needs a trusting dentist.<//review>

< Review>
Made an appointment based on great reviews and let me tell you, they didn’t disappoint. I went in for a check up, x-rays and cleaning. The hygienist who took care of me and did the cleaning did a very good THOROUGH cleaning. I was so used to in the past at various locations zooming through the first initial cleaning but she took her time and was very informative. Front desk to hygienist to Dr. Han all made me feel welcome, I knew I was in good hands. I’m actually out of network with my insurance but I will continue to keep going to VIP Dentistry because that is how good their service is. -Happy Customer!!<//Review>

Regarding doctor Han…I won’t visit any other dentist. In fact, for each appointment with Dr. Han, I drive 4 hours round-trip from Big Bear mountain, even though there are several available dentists within 10 minutes of my home. I do so whether it’s for something as simple as a check-up, a cleaning, or for something more serious as an extraction or an implant. I have an extensive knowledge of dental care and procedures from my years of working as a dental assistant. I have interned with, been tutored by, and worked with some of the best dentists in the business. And in my opinion, there is no better dentist today than Dr. Han.

Dr Han has demonstrated to me nothing but the highest level of professionalism. He is aware of, and expertly uses the latest technologies and up-to-date procedures. He continually proves to me that he deserves my trust and patronage. Not only does he provide the best care, he explains his procedural plan to his patients in plain language which puts them at ease and lets them feel secure that he will be taking good care of them. In short, he is:  professional, extremely intelligent, skillful, talented, learned, innovative, friendly, compassionate, concerned, dependable, trustworthy, and so much more.  Dr. Han also employs the most efficient, friendly, and caring of office staff.

I can’t say enough good about Dr Han and his practice, and heartily recommend him to anyone who is looking for someone to provide them a variety of expert dental care.

Sincerely, patient - Denise Loo<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>VIP Dentistry is an excellent choice for any of your dental needs. I was very impressed with my overall experience from start to finish. From the moment I walked in the door, I was impressed. Not only was the staff very polite and professional, but the place was extremely clean as well. Dr. Han is a master at his craft. I felt very comfortable with him working on my teeth and couldn’t recommend him or this establishment enough. I work Monday - Fri and couldn’t get time off to come in during the week. Dr. Han took time out of his weekend to see me and get me situated! This place is wonderful, thank you guys for everything! 5-Stars!<//review><Time>1619303149276</Time>< Resp>

Dr. David Han has been my dentist/oral surgeon/cosmetic dentist for the last twenty years. Besides being exceptionally honest and a pleasure to be around, Dr. Han is an expert in his field. A decade ago we improved my smile and facial structure with veneers on the top eight teeth and it is the best investment I've ever made. They are still beautiful and like new. No different than ten years ago. His process does not take one visit like you hear on the radio about dental implants because he is meticulous and won't settle for less than perfect. On the other hand the process was smooth, well organized and implemented. Like I said, he is honest and that is hard to come by.< /text>

Walked in for my first appointment today and the staff at VIP Dentistry were very courteous and helpful. They were attentive to any questions and concerns I had about my dental health and were extremely thorough throughout the whole process, which included X-rays and teeth cleaning. Very satisfied with my experience and will be coming back for future follow-ups.</Text>

<review>My two front teeth were permanently yellow,  and had fluorosis when they first came out. I had them bonded as a young teenager, then 21 years ago, had veneers put in. Unfortunately, the veneers that were picked out were yellow compared to the rest of my teeth, and over the years they were beginning to crack.  I wasn't looking forward to getting them fixed because my past dental cosmetic experience had been mediocre, at best. Dr. Han doesn't believe in the one size fits all approach. I could tell that the veneers he created were carefully studied in proportioned to my mouth, and to the rest of my teeth. I also liked the fact that, unlike the other experience, he knew that this was a big investment, and suggested that I bleach my teeth, because once I pick a color for the veneer, there was no going back. My teeth are not perfect, yet I wanted a natural look, this is hard to work with, but with Dr. Han's talent, and work ethic, he created that look for me. I have never had white teeth, or got compliments before,  and now I do, thanks to Dr. Han. I also liked the fact that he didn't bad talk about my previous dentist's work on my teeth. I am very glad I was referred to Dr. Han by my fiance to his practice. This is one happy customer!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Dr. Han and his staff are friendly, informative and excellent caregivers. Dr. Han has given me a smile I am thrilled to show, and he and his hygienist have worked to improve my gum health. They take their time and explain everything thoroughly. The girls in the front office are also caring and helpful.</Text>

< Review>
Doctor Han has an excellent bedside manner. He made me feel like I have been his patient forever. He believes in doing what it takes to keep your natural teeth rather than upsetting you into a mouth full of implants. I will require a couple of those for sure but he wants to get my gums healthy so I possibly can save a couple of teeth I thought were definite goners.
I really liked him and recommend you give him a visit if you are looking for a GOOD dentist.</Review>

< Review>
I had my bridge done 15 years ago and start having problems.  The bridge came loose so I went back to the dentist and this time he was unable to explain why it loose and give me options that I’m not comfortable with.  So, I had looked up a bunch of reviews and was very impressed with the reviews at VIP Dentistry by David S. Han DDS.  The office is calm and organized, all the up to date dental technology, plus terrific staffs!  They even have a service dog to help those people who feel nervous.

During the consulting Dr. Han answered all my questions, he even explained how my bridge became loose and how it caused it.  I love the fact that Dr. Han take his time briefly explained the situation and condition and gave me best possible choices to go with.  He truly cares about his patients and will only tell you what you need and what will make you most comfortable.  The choice is up to you to decide whether or not you want the treatment.  There is no pressure from him at all!

I just start with Dr. Han for few months now for implants and whenever I had an appointment with Dr. Han, his confidence and competence was very obvious and always putting me at ease with my procedure.

Overall, Dr. Han is very professional and knowledgeable in his work.  He explained the whole process to me so that I will be comfortable with each procedure and what to expect. Dr. Han also explained to me the plans and reasoning for each treatment and I was provided with detailed instructions before and after surgeries/procedures.  He also call to make sure I was fine after my producer.  Each of my producers are painless as he promised.  I highly recommended VIP Dentistry by David S. Han, DDS.</Review>

Dr. Han is extremely knowledgeable, considerate, and compassionate. Beyond excellent routine care, he ranks as one of the nations foremost experts in TMJ disorders.

I've been seeing Dr. Han for a month now for veneers and I have to say my experience with him thus far have exceeded my expectations! His staff is very friendly and provides some of the best service on the west coast. Dr. Han doesn't skimp on any information and educates you on the work he's going to be doing for you and tells you why. He also doesn't try to upsell any services or rather he'll let you know if any of the work you're requesting is actually unnecessary. I highly recommend Dr. Han to anyone that wants amazing dentistry work done!< /review>

I usually do not go out of my way to write any type of review, good or bad, unless it was an extreme experience and I wish someone would have told me beforehand. Dr. Han has more experience than most. You can google how many hours it takes to renew a dentistry license. Dr. Han spends more than 400 hours a year. 400 hours. That is 8 times the amount of hours it takes to simply renew the license, and it shows. Dr Han learned much of his practice outside of dentistry school; in other words, he performs procedures that are not taught in dentistry school.  I had previously been going to a different doctor and he had put a crown on one of my teeth. A few weeks later I switched dentists because I was still having pain on that tooth. When I met Dr. Han, he informed me that my previous dentists had left a small gap between my crown and my tooth. Dr Han really made my comfort a priority. I had no pain, discomfort, or critiques about Dr Han as he used devices I had never seen or heard of before to help better my teeth. I can't stress enough how happy I am that I switched dentist offices.
It goes past the doctor himself, the staff is much more open and friendly than most places. I am welcomed with a smile and a friendly greeting when I enter and have acquainted myself with the staff.</text>

I have been with Dr. Han for many years now. I trust him completely to do excellent dentistry in a friendly and welcoming environment. Sandra, my dental hygienist, has cleaned my teeth now for several years and it is always a pleasure to have her see to my dental health.

I recommend Dr. Han and his staff unreservedly.< /review>

First off. Just let me start off by saying that I’m terrified of going to the dentist. Childhood trauma with a terrible experience. Until I met Doctor David S. Han. He is hands down one of the most Amazing dentist. He’s extremely talented and caring. He cares about his clients and his amazing dental artistry. His staff is so sweet. Always with a genuine smile. And now with all the Covid craziness. You can rest assure that his dentil office and well trained staff is 100% clean. VIP dentist for life. ❌💋❌💋🍷< /text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>I went to Dr Han back in 2016.I chipped my two front teeth and he fixed my smile I was so happy with the results. Him and his staff were so amazing with scheduling me in to making me feel relaxed through the whole process.I went back to him in June 2020 to get a crown on a tooth that had been bothering me for quiet a while. Then just this week I again chipped my front tooth (dam Halloween candy🙄) it happened Tuesday night so come Wednesday morning I call the office to tell them what happened and they were able to make an appointment for me the same day and as much as I wanted to go that day to avoid being seeing with a broken tooth, I had to wait to go in till Friday. Come Friday morning the entire staff was very welcoming and friendly. I had actually asked one of the employees there a question which they said they would look into and get back to me and without me asking them they answered the question. As always Dr Han and his staff goes above and beyond for his patients and his work is always the best. I always recommend him to my friends and family.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>If you're looking for a dentist who js compassionate, caring,  teamed with efficient, professional, caring staffs, please consider Dr. Han VIP Dentistry.  I have been going to his clinic for the past 3  years and the service is consistent.  Dr.Han's expertise, techniques &  knowledge in performing various dental procedures have been exceptionally commendable but more importantly, he will not provide unnecessary  aggrresive treatment options. He will save your teeth if he can while approaching to more conservative  evidenced based treatment options which made me feel he isn't just after profit but he  genuinely  cares for his patients. His style is marked with precision and uses latest technology  like music  & dog therapy to add to your comfort. I like that he thoroughly explains his  treatment plans while he takes time to educate his patients. The staffs also ensure the patients are seen timely.  The office is super clean and his assistant Brian probably one of the best RDAs I've met-together they are great teams.  As a patient who is super OC and picky with cleaning, I also highly recommend their dental hygienist. Her hands are so light and she is very thorough and detailed with her cleaning.  I highly recommend Dr. Han for any patient looking for a dentist who strives for the highest standard of care and if you desire precision in dental work, this is the place to go.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The best dentist I ever had! Dr. Han takes his time to explain everything and answer questions. He gives you professional advice that will inhance your way of living by taking take of your teeth. An anxiety free setting. He makes sure you are 100 percent comfortable before starting any procedure and during procedures. A 3 hour procedure flew by because they placed headphones on with my favorite music. Exceptional! I've been to so many dentist, and wasted my money on treatmemt that was not done properly. And thanks to Dr. Han he fixed the problem. Thank you to the dental assistance as well who are beyond supportive through this process to all guess that walk in. Life changing !</Review>

I have been going to Dr. Han for
over 20 years.  He and his staff have been best in class.  I have been wearing a mouth guard he made for me since I first started seeing him and it has been a life saver. I wear the mouth guard every night and it has eliminated the clicking noise in my jaw as well as helping with any grinding issues.  Dr. Han provides excellent service and goes the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied with his work. My family and I highly recommend him.<//Review>

<Text>Dr. Han is hands down the BEST dentist. I have severe anxiety about going to the dentist. He and all of his staff are soooo patient and caring with me that I have come to love going to visit them. They have a therapy dog and bose headphones to help take your mind off of it. Anyone who has a fear of the dentist should visit his office.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< review>
I have TMJ pain for the past 12 months. I saw 3 dentist, physical therapist, chiro, oral surgeon, neurologist and ENT. All prescribed heavy pain killers and prayed my pain will go away. Well it didn’t. I find doctor Han info through google search as I was desperate for a relief. The lovely Alex answered the phone and listened to my problem. She was so sweet and kind that she gave me appointment the same day as I was in real pain. The office environment was very relaxing and beautiful. The office manger who is Also Dr Han wife was super nice and very helpful in explaining about treatments and insurance which was very instrumental. Dr Han listened  to my problem with empathy and that’s when I realized I was in good hand because he was asking questions that are relevant to my problems. I felt that he genuinely wants to help me and elevate my pain. He then proceed to give me options about my treatment. The last oral surgeon I saw told me that I need a surgery to fix my pain. Dr Han disagreed with that option and said always try non invasive/reversible treatment.  Initially I was skeptical that a simple bite stabilizer would solved a year long problem and considering the amount of pain I was in but decided to go ahead with that treatment. First week pain was the same. The second visit adjustment was the best thing that happen to me since the onset of pain. I couldn’t believe how rapid was the pain relief. I am glad and thankful I didn’t go with the surgery option. It was pleasure watching Dr Han doing his magic. He is level headed and precise like a pilot landing a concord jet. I am greatly thankful for that coincidence that saved me from surgery. Brianna his RDA was very helpful and kind in explaining care instructions and the recovery stages. Brian RDA was a wonderful and remarkable young man. He showed great professionalism and kindness during my treatment that made my recovery less stressful. I am very lucky that I find this dental team and today I told Dr Han that he will be my dentist even after I go back home O/S. Very humble, intelligent and innovative Doctor and team.</review>

<Review>In September 2020 I asked Dr. David Han to redo the bondings he did for me on my upper front teeth in 2010, this visit was 2 weeks before my 66 birthday.
I asked Dr. Han if he would redo the bondings for me because they had worn down a bit and I wanted to lighten them also. I mentioned to him that my upper lip was not as full as it once was and cosmetic surgery was not an option for me.
Dr. Han told me that he could improve the appearance of my front teeth and create an attractive smile by improving the shape, color, also provide a  functional bite, with the bonus of giving me the appearance of a fuller upper lip. Dr. Han and his team took impressions for bleaching trays and for him to make a diagnostic wax-up to show me what my teeth would look like with 6 upper porcelain veneers. I said, with excitement, let's do it!
In November after completing bleaching I went in for my appointment for impressions for the veneers and went home with acrylic temporary veneers.
I truly appreciate how meticulous Dr. Han was from beginning to the end of the process. He worked side by side with his lab to make sure my veneers were exactly what he wanted.
A week later I went in to see him because I managed to dislodge a portion of my temporary. Dr. Han removed my temporary and tried in 2 veneers which led him to make a slight change to achieve the results he was looking for.
December 16th I received my 6 veneers. Dr. Han is truly an artist.Teeth have to be harmonious with the facial shape. Dr.Han achieved that with my veneers, they were so precisely made for me.
Dr. David Han and his team strive for excellence. I'm very grateful for the esthetic and functional results he provided for me. I have beautiful porcelain veneers that have given me a smile that I'm confidant and happy with. Additionally, the veneers created by Dr. Han have given me the appearance of having a fuller upper lip without cosmetic surgery.

Sincerely thank you Dr. Han,
and VIP dental team.

My experience at VIP Dentistry. During my Dental  exam Dr. Han saw that I was wearing a flipper and asked if I wanted to have it replaced with an implant. I was not sure,  because I had worn the flipper for a while, and had no idea how my life could be so much better if I had an implant. After discussing the procedure of bone grafting and time.  I said ok to the procedure. The flipper I had did not fit well, and I had space between my real teeth on both sides of the flipper. Dr. Han explained he could design the implant with extra material on the side that would look like another tooth, but smaller than a regular tooth,  It would close the spaces between my teeth. I wasn’t sure how that would look, but Dr Han convinced me that it would work, and it look and feel better than the flipper. I said yes, and the process began. Finally, it was time to get the implant. The process was and pain was minimal, and I had my implant. I must tell you, not having to wear the flipper has been the best decision I’ve ever made. The implant has given me the confidence to talk and laugh not having to hold back. The extra spaces have been closed off. I no longer have to place and remove my flipper to clean. The implant is a perfect fit. My daughter is getting married in a couple of days and I feel with my implant I can smile with confidence, and take pictures with the biggest smile ever. Thanks to Dr. Han and staff for taking the time to design and fit my implant and temporary tooth.<//review>

What a wonderful experience! I had a cracked tooth and was very nervous about going to the dentist, I have high anxiety. Everyone there was friendly, understanding, and kind. The numbing process was so easy and painless he was thorough and made me feel safe. They make you feel more like family than a patient. If you are looking for a dentist in the Chino, Chino Hills area this is your place!</Review>

<Text>I have always had a Major phobia toward the dentist, due to a couple bad experiences I had in the past. But as soon as I walked into Dr.Hans office, I was greeted by this Gorgeous white poodle, “Noel” and by the friendly staff. After I talked to the doctor and explained how I felt he understood and made me feel So comfortable. Now I feel so ready for my upcoming procedures, with minimal fear. I’m glad I found this dentist office and I’m so grateful to Dr. Hans and his kind staff and the friendly Noel!</Text><user_id>110497273447416477487</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Especially for something like a crown. I do hope the end result turns out as well as their customer service is. It will be so nice to be able to easy and fro m workout planning how to chew or take a drink. Dr. Han was amazinnd even personally called me today after my procedure to see how I was doing. I’ve never had such amazing, caring, and professional service. I never once felt uncomfortable about the condition of my teeth. They made me feel welcomed immediately and helped
relieve my fears, as I was pretty hysterical thinking I for sure was going to be told I would lose my tooth. I hope I don’t have as cavities as I think I do, as I would love to finally get my teeth taken care of and be more comfortable. Thank you VIP staff and Dr. Han. What a wonderful practice!!</Text></record>

Btw, my veneers are over 20 years old and they still looks amazing. Highly recommended.< /review>< response>

<text>Dr. Han is amazing!  I needed my front tooth fixed due to a swimming accident years ago and he took the time to make it perfect!  He took countless pictures, spoke to the lab personally (even went down there to articulate what he wanted for my cap), and explained every step of the process to me.  And it was painless...

In the end, it took a few months to get it right, because he’s a perfectionist.  And if there’s anyone we want to be a perfectionist, its our doctors!

But its not just this one incident.  It’s the maintenance.  His office staff is amazing.  They text me reminders and keep me on point to maintain the health of not only my teeth, but my son’s.  My son loves Dr. Han and refuses to go to any other dentist.  We have a ongoing joke about Dr. Han’s perfectionism and how he and his staff cares more about our teeth than us! We often say “Dr. Han would not allow that...”

Also he provides an iPod and noise canceling ear phones to enjoy music...one time my music selection prompted a conversation about 90s rap vs. today’s rap, lol!  He’s awesome...

Highly recommend!  🌟🌟🌟🌟</text>< pics>

VIP Dentistry gave me the best experience I have ever had at a dentist. I visited for gum contouring and Dr. Han was very friendly and knowledgeable. This made me trust him almost instantly and because of him I am more confident in smile. Would recommend to anyone without hesitation.<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I just went to have a loose crown re- cemented.

Not only was that done swiftly and professionally, I had an x-ray, a very informative discussion and diagnosis about my root canal that anchors my crown, advice on how to improve my smile and he did a little, pain-free work to improve my bite.

Friendly and professional staff.

For a  person who is normally quite intimidated by the dentist's chair, I was put at ease by Mr. Han's reassuring expertise.

All in all, a VIP service.</text>< Pics>

My maintenance exam visit was delayed because of COVID. the visit was wonderful and efficient. I called after parking to notify my arrival. Then they let you in. I was taken to the hygienist chair right away, had x-rays done, doctor checked me during the cleaning. Then afterwards I bought my accessory for rôdaient toothbrush. All done smoothly. I really like the air purifiers that are strategically placed. I am getting older and realize that dental check-up is just as important as my regular medical health check-ups.< /text>

Dr. Han is simply amazing.

Thoughtful, caring, thorough and extremely attentive.

When I first looked at getting veneers I was told that I needed jaw surgery. They would need to cut open my jawline and insert a titanium plate to give me my desired smile.

The surgery was going to require 12 months of braces, 6 months of recovery and another 6 months of braces to give me the smile I wanted!

I met one of Dr. Hans clients who had a beautiful simile and she said I absolutely must meet him so I set an appointment for a routine cleaning and consultation.

Dr. Han was the first Dentist that offered me hope for a great smile without surgery!

In fact in the first visit he went above and beyond and created a temporary extension of my front teeth showing me what would be possible without surgery!!

Dr. Han is meticulous and detailed and has had me come back a few times to try the temporaries before finalizing the permanent teeth. I lost a temporary at one point and he got me in the same day without a problem.

He explained the process, the timeline, and the cost and was very detailed in answering all my questions.

Not to mention his staff is incredible - Alex and Daisy are very sweet and have tremendous attention to detail.

I am very happy with the result, the office and the care that he and his team provide.

I highly encourage anyone that is considering a Dentist or cosmetic work to set up a consultation with Dr. Han!< /Text>

I have been going to VIP Dentistry for years literally since I was a child and I am now 21 with a kid and plan on taking my daughter to Dr.Han as well. I love the staff and how warm everyone is there. Dr.Han always takes great care of me and always checks up on my siblings, mom, and I and stays on top of our dental care. I love this place and would recommend it to everyone 10/10!!!!</review>

I’ve been coming to VIP dentistry for years. Dr. Han is a “fixer “, what ever dental problems you may have, the man fixes it. His relaxed easy going professional attitude makes visiting him and the entire staff a pleasure. The whole family vibe there makes you feel welcome. I’ve been to many dentists in my many years but Dr Han is by far the best. I would and have recommended to anyone needing dental work.<//Review>

<Review>Best dentist I've ever gone to. Dr. Han and his team of hygienists are very thorough. This is the first time anyone has noticed that my jaw clicks when I open and close it (symptoms of TMJ). He also noticed I grind my teeth at night, which can cause migraines.

I had my teeth cleaned by Emma and she was very gentle. It did not hurt at all. They measure your gums to make sure there's no underlying issues (i.e. any symptoms of periodontal disease).

He offers general cleaning services at very competitive prices as well. I would not hesitate to recommend their office.<//Review>< pictures>

Dr. David Han and his staff, makes me feel welcome all the time.  Dr. Han,  is a good men. The reason I've said that is because, he really is. He will find the best way to help you. He's very analytic, very professional, he will look at all the details of the situation. And he will find the best way. And If he made a mistake, he will tell you and he will try again and again. Until he get the best results.  I have a TMJ issues for at least 25 years. If you don't know TMJ, the symptoms are crazy. Some of the symptoms are clicking, popping jaw, jaw locking, pain in cheek muscles, ringing sound in the ear, stuffy nose, sinus, headaches, balance problem, vertigo, diminished of hearing, sore throat, shoulder aches, reduced range of movement. But one of my biggest issue is my sore throat, my hoarseness. I sing as Praise and worship leader at the Church and I'm also a classic rock singer on the weekend. And for the last 6 years it gets worst. Thank to Dr David Han, my voice is back. No more hoarseness and a small lump that lingers to your throat. I receive a dental implants with Dr. Han at the same time he made me a stabilizer that I wear, every night to sleep. What a big difference in my life, no more dizziness, no more vertigo. I feel like a new men. I'll give Dr Han a 5 star. Thank you Doc.<//text>

<user_name>Charlie S<//user_name><Rate>5<//Rate><review>Dr. Han and his staff far exceeded expectations and went well above and beyond to make me feel comfortable during a situation which required an emergency dental procedure. Blanca was amazing and was able to work me in for an appointment only a couple of hours after I called. Daizy helped me feel at ease during the prep work, and Dr. Han explained what he planned on doing in detail prior to starting, as well as during the procedure itself. What really sticks out is the fact that Dr. Han took time out of his schedule to personally call me later in the evening to make sure I was doing okay. Never in my nearly 50 years have I had medical professionals display the amount of care an compassion as Dr. Han and his staff did. I would give VIP Dentistry many more stars, but Google only has 5.< /review><user_id>105006737868903593782< /user_id>< pictures>

Always a top of the line experience, that’s why I drive an hour to see Dr. Han & his lovely staff! :) He is sincerely passionate about dentistry, always using the latest technology, very innovative, and his top priority is his patient’s care. Best dentist there is! Also, if you grind your teeth he is the go to doctor.< /text>

<Text>Hands down, best dentist ever. Dr. Han and his staff are so attentive, efficient and friendly it makes going back enjoyable every time.

<text>Where do I begin.  I had a crown fall out and my regular dentist had retired.  Mind you, I've been going to that dentist for about 30 years. I was in a panic on where to go. My sister recommended Dr. Han but I was terrified to go see someone new. As soon as I walked in the staff was very welcoming and very polite. When I met Dr. Han, I was a total mess, very scared and nervous . He must of saw that. He was  nice and very understanding.  He sat me down talk to me and reassured me everything would be ok and he totally kept his word. I have never met a dentist or even a doctor that cares as much as Dr Han. I need a lot of work done so to cut a long story short. IF YOU EVER NEED A DENTIST, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR. HAN. I wish all medical  professionals would be half the Doctor he is. Thank you Dr. Han and staff, you all are the best.< /text>< pics>

I am originally from NY where I swore I was getting the upmost dental care (That was not the case). Huge recognition for Dr. Han for being so humble, honest, caring, and intelligent within his practice. His awesome assistant Brian, for being so kind, and such a great right hand to Dr. Han. And lastly, Alex and team for being so patient, informative, and welcoming always. To say the least, this team is the closest to family I have gotten since I moved to California three months ago. Thank you for all that you do, and for being so knowledgable to best serve our community. Note: I have a complex TMJ case/severe cross bite. Dr. Han's TMJ stabilizer has given me outstanding results in such little time. If you suffer from TMJ symptoms, know that you can trust him and his practice to make a difference for you! 10 stars for this team**********!<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dccd37899c6b2b:0xd2bcc578427104dc</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Han is the best I was in need of major dental work including bone graphs as well as raising my sinuses to allow the implants to be installed. I went to at least 6 dentists over the past 10 years and they told me that it could not be done. I was going to lose my teeth do to bone loss from an accident I was in and dentures would be the only option that can be done. Dr. Han took x-rays and did an evaluation and said he could do it. He explained the entire procedure that I would have to go thru and that it would take some time to finish the reconstruction of my jaw line and get me basically a new smile and return to having back teeth. Well it was allot of work and it took over a year for healing and getting every thing done in steps which is exactly what he told me. Today I could not be any happier I have my smile back and a full mouth of teeth again everything was done so professionally and with very little pain or down time. I was good to go a few hours after the bone graph surgeries and I always felt like I was in good hands and new I was in the best Dentist office to solve my issues. Dr. Han's facility is very nice and his Staff is so helpful and caring they keep you informed and are there to help anytime and I always felt that Dr. Han and his staff were giving me the best care and this whole experience  really did exceed my expectations on what it would be like at the end. I had several dentist tell me how much they would charge me and Dr. Han after all he did it was 1/2 of what the other Dentist said they would charge but they could not do the job anyway. Dr. Han is my vote for Dentist of the year and I recommend Dr. Han 100% he is a very caring man who totally explains and tells you his vision of the outcome, I feel his vision was exact to the fished product. What Dr. Han gave me is quality of life that i thought was not possible because for 5 years that is what i was being told. If you take my advice and go there ask to see Noel, she is a doodle that greeted me at the door in the reception area and is such a great dog and really is part of the experience. Love everything about this place and Dr Han and his staff. Here is a pic with my new teeth I am the old guy with my wife and son.<//Text>

<Review>I just wanted to express my sincere thanks to Dr. Han and his entire staff .  After coming into his office just 3 months ago he has definitely performed a major miracle with my teeth.  I definitely have no problems going back for my routine checkups.  Dr. Has shown me great patience and understanding to get my teeth back into proper health.

My sincere thanks doesn't just end with Dr. Han but, it definitely continues with his entire staff.  I know when I can in there's always a pleasant voice at the other end exhibiting a great professional and very helpful attitude to answer my questions.  I know when I go into the office I'm always great and extremely friendly smile ready to make my visit an awesome experience.  The team of dental hygienist's are the best who have taken the time to always understand my questions regarding my treatments.  There patience and understanding as definitely helped me regain my teeth back into proper health.

I just wanted to finish out by once again expressing my most sincere thank you to the entire VIP Dentistry team.  I fully recommend this office to anyone looking for a Great Team!

Thank you

This is my experience with Dr. Han after getting 4 veneers on my front teeth.

I went to Dr. Han looking to get the gap in front teeth closed. I came in for bonding because I felt that was the cheapest option that I saw online. Dr. Han went over all the options for me accessing the pros and cons of each. We went over braces, bonding, and veneers. For bonding he even placed some temporary ones on to see how I would look. I decided to go with the veneers because they would look the best and they could last more than 20 years if I take care of them. Dr Han gave his recommendations and the cost and let me think about it and talk with my family to ask their opinion.

My next visit Dr. Han took pictures and made a mold of my mouth and to make a 3D model. With the model he sculpted my teeth the way he wanted to, so I could see what the adjustments would look like before they were permanent. It was a very thorough process. He also took another mold so I can bleach me teeth for a couple weeks to match the lighter color of the veneers.

My next visit Dr. Han showed me the 3D model and went over what looks best for my teeth considering my smile, my face, the size of my lips etc. Then he placed some temporary veneers on, so I can see if I liked them but also Dr. Han wanted me to show my family and ask for their opinion on it. He even called me after a few days to see how it was going and asked for any feedback or if adjustments needed to be made.

My next appointment my veneers went in and Dr. Han placed 4 veneers on my front teeth. I was done in less than two hours and I couldn’t be any happier. My temporary veneers looked good, but my final ones looked even better! The entire staff was friendly and professional, and I recommend Dr. Han for any dental work.< /review>

<Time>1449989422010< /Time><rate>5<//rate><text>I am so happy to have found Dr. Han! For many years I had a crown on one of my front teeth that did not match my other teeth.  I met with Dr. Han and he made his recommendations for how to improve my smile. Instead of charging me more for a veneer AND a crown like I thought I needed, he recommended I do at- home whitening and replace only the one mismatched crown. He took his time with me, was very honest, and he genuinely cared about my situation.
Since then Dr. Han has made a temporary crown for me that looks better than any other crown I've ever had. Also, his at-home whitening system has worked so much better than the one hour whitening I tried at another dentist several years ago. This method of whitening lasts longer and can be maintained by doing a quick touch up yourself every few months at home.
Dr. Han really strives for perfection and wants his patients to look as good as possible.
In addition to his great cosmetic work, his staff is so nice and welcoming. They really create a calm, relaxing environment. I wish I would have gone to Dr. Han a long time ago instead of suffering with embarrassing, mismatched teeth!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>Dr Han is the very best I had a major problem I lost basically all my molars in the back top and I had almost 0 bone so could not get implants or anything to help with my issue. Dr Han recommended that I have Sinus Lift Surgery and that would allow the bone I lost to start growing again and I had the surgery and have had no issues or pain of any kind. In 5 months the bone will be more established and we can start working on the implants and other ways he has found to solve my problem. He explains everything and is the best Dentist I have ever met and will be under his care for life.Dr Han gets a 100% rating from me. The staff is also the best I have worked with they are very helpful and very complete if you are not with Dr Han you should be.<//review><user_name>D&K Meza< /user_name>< userid>

<review>After struggling with different mouth guard experiences, I found a first rate one.
Dr. Han's care is precise, detail oriented and friendly (staff as well).
His mouth guard protects my teeth from grinding and most importantly to me is with great fit and comfort. Sleep is without distraction. I highly recommend Dr. Han.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

There are not enough words to express my gratitude and satisfaction for VIP Dentistry. I received amazing service from the beginning to the end of my services. The entire staff made me feel welcomed and cared for immensely. They were personable and expressed genuine concern for my problems.

I originally called to make an appointment for my throbbing TMJ discomfort. I was extremely uncomfortable, and they were happy to take me in that day. I did not wait at all, and was seen right away. Not only that, but the staff really took the time to get to know me and make me feel right at home. I am not exaggerating when I say that I was smiling the entire visit.

Normally, dentists and dental offices give me extreme anxiety. However, this office was different from all previous experiences. I felt at home, and extremely comfortable (which I have never felt at any office before!) When Dr. Han came in for my visit, he was extremely personable and kind. I felt like he spent the time to educate me about my condition, provided me all the options, but made me feel listened to and cared for. He was an extraordinary dentist, but he also expressed immense passion for his patients and the improvement of the dental industry in general. It was obvious that he wanted to offer only excellent care, and I certainly did not receive anything less than that.

What touched me most of all was my experience with the office manager. I told her in a prior conversation that I had only been in the area for 1 month for school, and all my family and friends were in San Francisco. While I was waiting for the doctor, she surprisingly came in and simply talked to me and got to know me. She actually brought tears to my eyes due to her genuine empathy and concern. She knew how hard it would be for me to go through these big changes without my support system, so she just wanted to be there for me during the visit. I never experienced that in a dental office, or in life. In this office, I felt cared for not only as a patient, but as a human being. That experience, to me, is priceless in itself.<//text>

<review>2019:  Update. I revisited for my biannual dental hygiene check up. ALL GOOD!  I am really enjoying my veneers that Dr Han did for me. What difference it makes in my confidence. I don’t know why I hesitated for so long. Staff is fantastic. X-ray exam is easy with the new technology. He is just as caring. If I have one thing to add, it’s Noel (his service Labradoodle) she is a plug of pure love. She laid on my lap while I was getting my teeth cleaned. I look forward to my next visit.

I have had Dr Han for many years.  Meticulous in his skills and gives individualized attention and thoroughly discusses the treatment options. Impressed with his  cosmetic dentistry. I was planning on costly veneers until he explained the options and the reasons for his recommendations. Couldn't be happier with the result!  Highly recommended.
1/13/2017:  Yes. He is still my dentist. I am extremely pleased with my veneers!  What a subtle way to boost your self confidence .. in a great smile.

2018:  decided to get veneers 1 yr ago. They look beautiful and so natural. I went with the shade that Dr Han recommended and couldn’t be happier! I smile. Smile is contagious and makes your day more brighter. It’s a subtle change in “something about you” that pays back many times over. THANK YOU!!!!</review><Date>1569690510347< /Date></record>

Dr. Han is the best! He does impeccable work  in both cosmetic and general dentistry. He recently replaced 3 crowns for me that were previously done by another dentist. 2 were damaged and one did not fit properly. Since Dr. Han has completed the work I have been so much happier. I have no pain or sensitivity (no root canal needed) and my bite is so much more comfortable. He was extremely thorough and even made adjustments to my bite on teeth that he wasn’t working on. Dr. Han’s expertise and quality of work is the best I’ve ever experienced. He continues to exceed my expectations. I will not go anywhere else... thank you Dr. Han!!!

Update: 2 check ups later and still couldn’t be happier with Dr. Han & his staff... 2  Perio maintenances completed; both very comfortable and easy. This is the first time in my adult life that I’ve gone to 2 consecutive check ups without having thousands of dollars of unnecessary recommendations made. This proves to me that in addition to doing GREAT work, Dr. Han is the most honest and trustworthy dentist I’ve ever been to. Thank you (again) Dr. Han! Please never retire!  : )< /Review>

There are not enough words to express my gratitude and satisfaction for VIP Dentistry. I received amazing service from the beginning to the end of my services. The entire staff made me feel welcomed and cared for immensely. They were personable and expressed genuine concern for my problems.

I originally called to make an appointment for my throbbing TMJ discomfort. I was extremely uncomfortable, and they were happy to take me in that day. I did not wait at all, and was seen right away. Not only that, but the staff really took the time to get to know me and make me feel right at home. I am not exaggerating when I say that I was smiling the entire visit.

Normally, dentists and dental offices give me extreme anxiety. However, this office was different from all previous experiences. I felt at home, and extremely comfortable (which I have never felt at any office before!) When Dr. Han came in for my visit, he was extremely personable and kind. I felt like he spent the time to educate me about my condition, provided me all the options, but made me feel listened to and cared for. He was an extraordinary dentist, but he also expressed immense passion for his patients and the improvement of the dental industry in general. It was obvious that he wanted to offer only excellent care, and I certainly did not receive anything less than that.

What touched me most of all was my experience with the office manager. I told her in a prior conversation that I had only been in the area for 1 month for school, and all my family and friends were in San Francisco. While I was waiting for the doctor, she surprisingly came in and simply talked to me and got to know me. She actually brought tears to my eyes due to her genuine empathy and concern. She knew how hard it would be for me to go through these big changes without my support system, so she just wanted to be there for me during the visit. I never experienced that in a dental office, or in life. In this office, I felt cared for not only as a patient, but as a human being. That experience, to me, is priceless in itself.</Text>

<Text>I have been searching for a dentist that would properly address and treat my headaches related to TMJ issues without success over 10 years of searching. I was almost to the point of giving up until I came across Dr. Han.

I was very skeptical at first as I lost trust in the Dental practice all-together, but decided to give it one more attempt.

I was very surprised during my initial consultation at the knowledge and experience Dr. Han has with treating TMJ disorders. He took the time to explain what the cause and treatment options were for TMJ.

Although I had other issues with my teeth, Dr. Han listened to me and quickly developed a no nonsense treatment plan for my TMJ disorder using a bite stabilizer while also performing several adjustments to align my bite to relieve my TMJ disorder and relieve my headaches.

Dr. Han started to build my trust in him as he listened to my issues and addressed them quickly. I am still currently being treated by Dr. Han for TMJ, but the intensity of my headaches have diminished as well as my myofacial and jaw aches have subsided. He also addressed other issues with my teeth with the same conviction for the better of my teeth and gum health.

Moreover, he has an excellent, friendly staff that makes you feel welcome, comfortable and treats you as a VIP (pun intended).

Overall, I look forward to the day where my TMJ and headache symptoms are completely gone all thanks to Dr. Han and his staff.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dccd37899c6b2b:0xd2bcc578427104dc<//gmap_id><pics>None< /pics><Time>1563133362530<//Time>< Response>

<Review>After suffering from TMJ and lock jaw for a couple of weeks, I was referred to Dr. Han by one of his patients.  I called in and they were able to squeeze me in and get me an appointment the next day.  During the appointment, Dr. Han was very thorough in his examination and he explained to me why I was feeling the pain in my jaw and why I was only able to open my mouth a couple of millimeters.  He suggested I get the Bite Stabilizer.  I went in the following day and got fitted for the Stabilizer, and I immediately saw results.  Dr. Han took his time adjusting and perfecting the stabilizer and I wear it every night.   My pain has completely subsided, and now I am able to yawn, eat, and brush my teeth like I used to.  I don’t wake up with a tense jaw and my mouth and jaw finally feel normal once again.  His compassion, genuineness, and expertise are all reasons I would highly recommend him to anyone.  I also want to add that his office staff is amazing; they are kind, helpful, and make you feel at ease as soon as you walk in.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dccd37899c6b2b:0xd2bcc578427104dc</gmap_id>< time>

I went to VIP with extreme pain in jaw, to the point I couldn't open my mouth, and refused to eat it hurt too bad. I expected a long process to fix the problem. Then Dr. Han said all I needed was a custom TMJ Bite Stabilizer, and it would feel better within a few days. BS, I thought. But sure enough, 2 days pass and i am eating anything and everything, with 100% recovery! This Stabilizer is amazing! I would recommend this to everyone!</Review>

I highly recommend Dr. Han for anyone who is looking for the Best care for your teeth.
I am a medical doctor, and my father is a dentist.  A year ago, I developed a pain in my molar tooth.  I visited two local dentist.  They gave me an opinion of my tooth problem.  But, they didn't make sense to me.  One dentist told me I had to get my wisdom tooth out for my problem, and the other dentist told me I had to change all my fillings. So, I visited my father.  He could not find any problem.  Then I went to see Dr. Han.  He examined my tooth very carefully and took pictures of my tooth.  He told my I had cracked tooth and I needed a crown.  I am so glad I had it done.  My problem went away and I have been very happy.  Now a year later, I viisted him for cleaning.  He told me my other molar was beginning to have tiny crack.  I had crown done the same day and I am happy as ever. My first and second crown fit just like my tooth.

He is a master dentist because he thrives for perfection.  Again, I highly recommend him for anyone as a medical doctor and someone who has a dentist as a father.</text>

Dr. Han's office was the best dental experience I ever had. I was always fearful of dentistry, Dr. Han is gentle and truly cares about his patients. Previous dentist use to over numb me and Dr. Han got me numb with one shot! I will be a patient of his from now on! Sixty five years old and finally I have found a dentist I can trust who is painless! I have no insurance so they offered me $99 new patient offer for exam, x-rays and cleaning. It was worth every penny, the cleaning is almost an hour long and the hygienist is wonderful as well!<//Review>

<text>Dr. Han, my regular dentist, is a very pleasant & careful dentist who puts his patients first. He has helped with multiple problems, including cosmetic treatments, replacing old fillings, crowns, and re-seating a loosened bridge. As in the case of that bridge, more than once he has been able to save me money instead of putting in something entirely new but more costly.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><pictures>None</pictures><username>Han Meng</username><user_id>113213882991542204090<//user_id></record></dataset><record>
<user_id>111111273933432699052< /user_id><text>My daughter's teeth were very problematic.  After 1 root canal at the age of 12 (while under the care of the Orthodontist) and another one in the making, and being declared by the Orthodontist as treatment completed (3 months prior), my daughter suddenly developed tooth pain.  After seing an Orthodontist and General Dentist (who works in the same office) from a big dental office, I took my child to Dr. Han.  He took his time and showed personal concern as if she was his daughter.

He made himself accessible and was not afraid to give his direct phone number.  This gesture calmed down by nerves.  Since then, I could freely text Dr. Han for any concerns.

Now,  all the symptoms have subsided, and my daughter is on her way to recovery.< /text>< Resp>

Dr. Han's approach to dentistry and patient understanding, hands down is something un heard of these days. I had visited Dr. Han's office with the idea of cosmetic surgery to correct a gap and uneven smile. Now from previous experiences I've had with other Dr's. Not one of them ever addressed the underlying health concerns,  In my case gum issues.  They were quick to "sell" you a whole brand new smile without regards to overall medical benefits. They seemed over zealous with the notion of vanity over the patient's quality of life. Now on the other hand Dr. Han's honesty and integrity blew me away. He didn't seem so obsessed with making a pretty penny of off me, quite the contrary.  We tackled the underlying health concerns and when it came to designing my new smile with the idea of keeping one's own teeth. The man's attention to detail is 2nd to none. He took numerous measurements with different apparatuses, he studied my smile using my eyes, jaw movements and over all bite. He left me speechless with the end product. He surpassed my greatest expectations. Not only has he transformed my smile but also transformed my life. Thank you Dr. Han!!!<//text>

<Text>I don’t usually write reviews unless I despise the place haha. I hate going to the dentist, the norco dentist offices are terrible until I found VIP by mistake looking for a mouth guard for my TMJ. I didn’t think it would work because I don’t like being disappointed. I wore it the first night an it felt like no stress on my jaw. I am continuously wearing it every night because it’s like a part of my body now. I can’t sleep without it. I am very happy I found VIP. The mouth guard is expensive, but life is to short to worry about money and not being comfortable with your body. Thank you sooooo much and I recommend this mouth piece for people with TMJ. My jaw popped really loud, now it’s not as bad and still healing. Ofc u won’t get results immediately, but after about a week you look forward to wearing it! So thanks again!
An Jasmine is the best teeth cleaner you will ever have. She talks to you and makes you laugh. I have very bad anxiety esp being at the dentist office but she’s gentle with your teeth, an if you can’t stand the weird noise that the weird poker thing they use for ur teeth they have other options and an iPhone and headphones for you to use so you can’t hear the chalk board scratching noises! Haha thank you guys for being awesome and the front desk ladies greet me by names I wish I could do the same but I suck at remember anything. Thanks to all uv u.
Update:
I have terrible anxiety but I don’t have any when I’m talking to Dr. Han. He’s really nice and I appreciate his communication skills and appreciate that he cares about everyone’s input.
If u hav anxiety, gay, or shy come here everyone is just dandy!< /Text>< pictures>

I went here to order a breakfast plate that was on their online menu. Turns out they only have burritos! Well the menu said a breakfast burrito has eggs, beans, and potatoes - I received an egg burrito 👎
They asked me what kind of breakfast burrito I wanted when I ordered and I said the only one you have on the menu 😳 maybe that was the miscommunication, they have a confusing menu! It varies from online to the drive thru to the cooks!<//review>

<Text>Love this place! Large menu without being overwhelming, the staff is friendly, informative, and know the ingredients well, can answer any questions right away.  Location is easy to find, and parking is pretty plentiful (important once we get out of lockdown), seating is limited, but for great food on the go it is great!<//Text>< Pictures>

Food was terrible took forever and meat was actually cold ended up throwing most of Food away. And it wasn't cheap $30 for 1 burrito 3 tacos 2 fountain drinks. Don't recommend the Asada chunks or gristle that are not edible.<//Text>

<username>Steve K</username><text>I can easily say I’m pretty disappointed. Ordered the carne asada burrito with beans and rice. Figured “Burrito Factory”, must have great burritos. I figured wrong. The “asada” was just chunks of tough steak with gristle still in the centers causing me to have to actually spit out every other bite. The flavor was even more lackluster. Very bland. Even the beans and rice I found to be decent at best. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because my wife liked her chicken taco. Guess you guys should just call it “Taco Factory”.<//text>< user>

I have really big delicious burritos with many different meats from carne asada, chicken, pork, and my favorite chili verde.
The only negative is they always include tortilla chips and they always seem to be stale but I don't really eat their tortilla chips anyway and just like the burritos and they also have tacos street tacos and other Mexican food treats!< /review>

<text>This place is over rated or I just went on a bad day. The meat in the burrito and the tacos is too dry and lacks flavor. I noticed they use the microwave to warm up everything. The place was empty and i still waited for a long time for my order to be ready.
The portions are very dissent, too bad the flavor and freshness is not there. First and last time going to this place.</text><Rate>2<//Rate>< Time>

Food is good, fresh, and made quickly. Staff was very pleasant. The only drawback is the parking situation. It's tough to get in and out of. I ordered a burrito made to my wishes and there was no complaints from the staff.
Lot's of various salsas and pickled peppers to choose from and the burrito included more chips than I could eat. Great deal 👍< /review>

Guys :( you forgot to put the chile in the chile relleno, the burrito was just eggs and beans. The chile fries were amazing though, and she enjoyed sharing them with me.<//Text>

The food is always good. But simple orders take quite a long time to make. So make sure you are not in a hurry. However the food is always good.</review>

Every time, we are very careful during travel, etc, but the sauce makes a huge disaster mess in the bag, allover the chips sack, & once, even inside the car. This last order made me so mad, i even took photos of the broken containers & mess. This breaks my heart, because I enjoy the food from here so much 🥰<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Generous servings and an amazing hard shell taco! Also a clean dining area with a nice salsa bar. Self service counter with kind customer service. Sometimes you may have to wait a couple of minutes longer for your order but that is because they make everything fresh, completely worth it!< /Review>

DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT. I ordered through DoorDash and when the food got to my house I noticed I was missing food I ordered so I proceeded to call this restaurant and ask what happened, the lady that answered the phone was very unprofessional and honestly rude. She just kept telling me that all the food was in the bag when the driver picked it up. I went on to tell her we were missing items and clearly it was not in the bag. I asked if I could have a refund and her words were “ we can not do anything for you” I asked to speak with a manager and she went on to say they didn’t have a manager. Please do not order here. Worst customer service ever.<//text>

Let’s start with the service… The young lady who is usually working there it’s awful. She does not have common courtesy, Nor manners.

I have eaten there once and that was all that I needed. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito. I am still not certain if they messed up my order or the Carne Asada is just terrible. It had the fine consistency of Taco Bell’s ground beef And the saltiness of Spam. The beans were dry, And the lettuce tasted old and wilted.

I may have rated the place two stars if I had gotten decent treatment from the staff.

However, The next time that I want a cheese tasting burrito I will go to Taco Bell or Del Taco. It certainly was not worth $11 and change for a poor tasting burrito and dry Saltless chips.< /text>

I have been eating the Junior Mucho Macho Burrito for well over 20 years since this operation was in Sylmar that they had to close due to the rent or something. This place has excellent food and the people there are way cool. To this day I highly enjoy eating burritos there and never change my groove. I always get the shredded beef and it is a dream meal. For all of those haters it is amazing to know that this is not the place for them and you should go back to Taco Hell and eat what you like.

Keep it up!<//Review>

Good food. However I wish the restroom was indoors and cleaner. The sink looked had scum and dirt all over it and it was poorly lit. Aside from that, my over all experience was good.< /Text>

Really good, no frills, no BS burrito place. Whether going in store or drive thru, orders are served up pretty quick. Parking is a bit tight, the neighboring shopping center threatens to tow you away if you park there. There's quite a variety of burritos, including breakfast burros. A small salsa bar adds a spicy touch. Couldn't post a picture because I demolished my California burrito before writing this review.</Review>

<Text>I’m Gunna give you a honest review of my experience
I was honestly going to go to Taco Bell that day but I wanted to try something more authentic so I went here and ordered a burrito and a drink was around 15$ I was thinking in my head hm this is probably going to be good so I wait for a little while I got the burrito it was already close to cold the choice of meat I got was alright it’s not that tasty the cheese wasn’t melted all the way and it was not even that good so I was really overall disappointed I rather have just gone across the street to del Taco or go originally where I was going to go! The other places would have been more hot and tastier lol.. I don’t really recommend this place and I grew up from the valley so I know what’s up when it comes to good food!<//Text>< pics>

I do like the other burrito factories, however this one  was so disappointing. I ordered 2 chicken burritos and a soft chicken taco, the chicken was just normal unseasoned boiled chicken with no flavor. The price was about 30 dollars  for  this which was also disappointing. Maybe we will like the other meats,  however the chicken was bad enough to make me stay away from this location. I really wanted to like it as much as I love the other burrito factories but couldn't.<//text>

The food wasn't necessarily bad, but having a fiance that works in the restaurant business has shown me what to look for and to appreciate food some more. This place did not open at 7:30am as it states it does, the salsas are not up to par, beans were microwaved rather than done by pot and simmered, potatoes tasted day old in burritos, just not a place I would recommend.</Review>

The place for some simple good burritos. Breakfast burritos served all day. You can't beat it. Why not 5 stars? Always a wait even with no one in line or in the drive thru. Worth the wait obviously ha. Try it.< /review>

First of all I could eat the corn relish on the fixin's bar all day long! Great burritos and employees are very helpful and knowledgeable. Food prep is super fast. Small parking lot and it can be hard to get out sometimes when a drive-thru line forms.<//Text>

<review>Big burritos that don't taste very good. It's about the same cost of Chipotle, too. You can come here if you want something new but, otherwise, you have better options in the SCV.< /review>< userid>

Authentic North-of-the-border Mexican; much better than the "Mexicanish" chain fast food places that share the same corner. #6 Chile Relleno burrito with the spicy green chile on the side is my go-to.</Text>

Don't come here unless you want free Covid with your gas. The Hispanic or Indian female working the cash register was walking around mask-less indoors. She refused to put one on and became extremely rude and combative when asked. Horrible, horrible Covid spreading business.</Text>

Last time I ever come here for a smog test...

Obviously, I came here to get my biannual smog check.  I had a feeling it wasn't going to pass the inspection part of the smog test due to my after market exhaust.  And... I was right.

The reason I would never come back to these guys is because they only want your money. In the beginning of my smog check, the smog tech checked under my car to inspect the parts to make sure they were all legal.  I noticed him checking it for a good 5-10 min, kept looking at me, then went ahead and proceeded with the smog check. He ran all the tests, backed my car out and then told me the news...

He told me that it didn't pass because of my exhaust and that I would have to get it fixed before it would actually pass. I am livid because he knew well before he performed the test that it would fail because of this.  With that, they just want your money any way they can and don't give a lick about customer service.  I definitely will not be ever coming back here again.< /Text>

The only gas on Snell between Capitol expressway and Blossom Hill road. They can repair your tires here. Pay at the pump or inside. Slightly more expensive than other gas stations, but not bad for a brand name gasoline.</review>

I feel cheated everytime i go there. Maybe it's the pricing of drinks, but two redbulls had cost me $9. That just cannot be right. Be wary of this gas station - they may be trying to play you. Even gas was a hard issue that i'm uncertain is true.<//review>

I was inquiring about the smog check price and the quoted price seemed excessively expensive. I tried to negotiate and owner started to speak in obnoxious manner. I just walked away as it wasn’t worth to stick around and listen to the owner completely losing it.< /Review>

Belal Hamideh Law has a wonderful staff who is always available for any questions. They were also available whenever we had any concerns or questions about our case. They sat down with us for over an hour and really helped walk us through the entire settlement process and what we should expect. I am very glad that I worked with that firm and will definitely refer them to other people.< /Text>

I worked with Belal Hamideh and he was amazing. He was always helpful, responded to every email the same or the next day. He kept me updated throughout the entire process. I would recommend this firm to anyone that is having difficulty with the insurance companies paying any settlement. They have truly amazing customer service.<//Text>

I am always skeptical when it comes to working with law firms. But after my experience with Belal Hamideh Law, I have completely changed my point of view. They work so hard to get casework done in a timely manner and are ALWAYS willing to help. Thank you!< /Text>

I was skeptical about hiring an attorney for my Worker's Comp case, but Belal  won me over. He’s so professional, caring and understanding. He really fights for your rights and is passionate about getting his clients what they deserve. They help me through out this difficult process and situation that I was going through. They all made my life alot less stressful. Belal and his whole team are absolutely amazing.
hopefully I never go through something like this again but if I do you guys will be my first call thanks again.<//review>

I have known Belal Hamideh Law for many years, and have had many great experiences with them. I have referred clients to them that have also had great experiences, and rave about how hard Belal Hamideh Law worked for them. Belal Hamideh Law is my number one firm to go to for anything.<//Text>

<Review>Great lawyer, made everything very easy and understanding. I found out about Belal through my mom.  He helped her in an accident case also.  He spoke to me himself when the accident happened and took good care of my case.  He sent me to a good doctor that helped me feel better.  Then he negotiated my settlement himself.  He has assistants that help him on the case and they always answer my calls.   Great result and customer service.</Review><name>eyad shalabi<//name><user>114347074670203253485</user><Pics>None</Pics>< Rate>

<review>I had a car accident on 1/29/21 called Belal and spoke to him personally the same day. He talked me through the details of how a PI case works and I signed our contract. He immediately called a doctor and got me in the next business day to get my neck and back looked at . Belal seemed to be very prompt and caring about my injuries which made me feel very positive I had made the right choice for him to represent me. So far I had had a very pleasant experience with all the physicians his paralegal Mattalyn has chosen for me. I've had MRI's and Chiropractic care. I will keep updating as my case progresses.<//review>< pictures>

I was referred by a friend to see Belal after a car accident. When I called, the response was immediate and throughout the claim I was always provided with updates. I felt overwhelmed at first because it was right as quarantine started, but Belal and his team made it easy! It has been such a smooth and easy experience. I only had to speak with insurance company once to start the claim and then they took over. I am thankful that I found a great attorney to help me with my claim. I would definitely recommend Belal!</Text>

Belal Hamideh is an excellent attorney. I retained his services last year following an automobile accident in which I was the victim.The meeting with him was very brief yet very detailed and to the point. Mr. Hamideh was excellent in communicating with me via email and phone regarding my case. I was able to receive a favorable decision and I am sure it was due to Mr. Hamideh's efforts. I highly recommend Mr. Hamideh & his firm for your legal needs.<//review>

< Review>
It took me a while to compile this, because there are so many great words that I have about him. Belal took my case after another attorney, that totally screwed it up and was verbally demeaning. Belal promised to get me justice and he DID! My case was very hard and the company was denying their liability, making me a perpetrator instead of the victim of an assault by a coworker. Belal even settled a civil case in addition to the Worker's Compensation case. He is absolutely amazing. God Bless Him! He will fight for you and will treat you with respect and compassion. It's no wonder that he is considered a young STAR Attorney. Very Professional and Knowledgeable, as well as great hearted personality. All of these qualities in one person is such a rare case in our world. I believe that Belal Hamideh is one of the best attorneys, and I'm fortunate to have found him. My wife and I wish him all the best! A++++++++++++++</Review>

Belal Hamideh Personal Injury Attorney:

We had originally retained Belal for my wife's case which is complicated, but understandingly still ongoing. Among all of the lawyers we consulted with he was the only one who explained how everything works.

When I was injured my wife knew immediately to contact Belal. Soon after he got me to the correct doctors and made sure I was provided transportation to my appointments. He was very thorough and in constant contact with me on the progress and materials needed for my case. He was also honestly concerned with how I was progressing physically and how I was feeling mentally (he asked every time we talked and still does). If I had any questions or needs he would frequently return my calls himself or if he couldn't my case manager would get back to me that day or the next. He made sure I was compensated for missed work as well as my current and future medical expenses. My case was resolved in less than a year and the result exceeded my expectations. Belal truly goes above and beyond for his clients. Thank you for answering our prayers.

Sincerely,
Sean C.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><pictures>None< /pictures><text>If you have a worker’s compensation claim and need help, look no further! Mr Hamideh is the attorney for the job! Coming into my claim I had no idea that I would even need an attorney. When I hired Mr Hamideh, he took care of every aspect of my case. He made sure I under stood what was going on and how he planned to respond. I never had to worry about anything besides getting treatment and getting well. He was able to resolve my claim with a desirable amount. He fought for me in my claim and was able to get me the finances needed for my care. He is a man of his word, he is very polite and courteous. He assured me from the beginning he would fight hard for me, and he did simple as that!!! He even checked in often to see how treatment was going and I appreciated that considering my employer never even seemed to be empathetic about my injury. I highly recommend him. Kudos to Mr Belal Hamideh for an outstanding job handing my case.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was rear ended in February of last year and was in very strong pain in my neck and shoulder. My car was stopped at the traffic light and the other car crashed into me. I reached out to BelalHamidehLaw to seek assistance on getting the insurance process started. They immediately scheduled me for a medical exam near me at a time that worked for me and then handled everything from there onwards. They were sending me updates regularly on the case. When I told them I did not feel the chiro assigned to my case was helping me, they automatically changed me to another doctor who was much more helpful. Belal and his team were able to recover from the insurance all medical fees plus additional personal injury compensation. Julia was the one assigned to my case and she took the time to explain to me everything through the process and answer all my questions. Highly recommend this firm if you need a lawyer for an injury case.</review>< Pics>

<review>When the insurance company was pushing me around, and not giving me clear answers to my questions, I decided to call Belal Hamideh, we spoke on the phone about my case and he gave me multiple scenarios on what to expect of him as well the case. He also told me not to worry about anything that he would make sure that I win with the best outcome possible. He told he would get the most trust worthy and professional doctors we could get on my case. Not only did he keep his word but he made sure to regularly keep me in the loop, by personally calling to let me know how a court case went. If youre currently reading this review and youre not sure if you want to give him a call, just the fact that you're reading this proves youre interested and I can definitely/personally say, that 5 star review isn't for show. Its a fact.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I have and will continue to refer people to him, so they can have the best possible representation during their difficult time. Thank you for allowing me to start the next chapter in my life!< /review>

I Found Atty Belal Hamideh on google based on searching for a workers compensation Attorney... I called him at 11pm Friday evening because on google it shows open 24hrs; At 8am Saturday (next day) I spoke with the actual Attorney himself!  He is very Nice and provided a free consultation. He also listened to every question I had, unlike other attorneys I contacted they immediately want you to retain them. Atty Belal  provided & explained the process of  workers comp! Very thankful for the knowledge he shared because this is all new to me! Most definitely will refer and RECOMMEND him to people in need of an attorney!!!!</Text>

I had a work situation not that long ago where I was discriminated against at my place of work. It was a very stressful time being that I was also a female dealing with a very toxic male environment. After doing some thorough research, I came across Belal's firm where I was able to seek tangible advice that helped me tremendously. It's very nerve wrecking when you're unsure what to do in this type of a situation and I felt very limited however, they reassured me and helped me through the process allowing me some sense of relief. Not only are he and his team extremely insightful they have this type of confidence through their work and due diligence that makes you feel as if you're in the right place. I HIGHLY recommend him and his team because there is truly nothing better than feelingas if you're in the right hands!< /review>

Mr. Hamideh represented me in two cases, the first was for wrongful termination and the second for workers compensation. I was very highly satisfied with the outcome as he and his team all worked hard and diligently to get the best outcome for me. He is very profesional, courteous and takes the time to explain what his game plan is....and he is always a phone call away. I am very much grateful to him and his team of attorneys for assisting me in both these matters and you can rest assure that I will highly recommend him to anyone who needs his service.i  am completely satisfied with the outcome.</Text>

<review>I wanted to take the time to appreciate Mr. Belal Hamideh’s work. I am very thankful that although several other attorneys declined to handle my case, Mr. Belal took on the challenge and succeeded with a great outcome. His attitude and willingness to help people who have been in an accident is unmatched to other attorneys i’ve dealt with. I am also thankful for Maria Reyes who has been a great help through the process. I had a positive experience here and I would highly recommend him. I felt safe and I knew that he had my case under control. Thank you to everyone who made this process run smoothly and for always being there to communicate every step of the way as well as answering all of my questions in detail. You guys are appreciated.

Thank you,

Mr. Hamideh did an awesome job with my case. He took the time to explain to me all my options and what to expect worse case and best case scenario.

Belal was amazing he saw me right away! I needed someone to guid me and advice me the right way. At this point in my journey i don’t feel trusting of anyone and i NOW feel trusting of him!

Mr. Belal worked on my case for more than three years. Dispute the effort he put into my complicated case he still charged me less than any other attorney will charge. I always felt that my case is in good hands and never worried about the conclusion, as I know how much he works and care to settle my case with the maximum amount. He always kept me posted with any updates on my case and the most awesome thing that I was able to text him and him anything directly without having to go through his staff. I highly recommend him and will recommend to all my beloved one if they needed an attorney.<//Review>

The attorney was able to reach a settlement with my previous employer promptly and able to help me receive medical treatment after my previous employer declined to pay for my doctors visit. The firm is very knowledgeable and would respond to my emails and calls same day as well as remind me to show up to my court hearings. I definitely recommend the firm.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1563918928176, 'text': "Hi Elizabeth! I'm glad everything ended well for you. It was a pleasure to represent you.

I never thought I would be in a situation where I had to contact a lawyer. However that quickly changed this past summer. I was very scared and confused on what to do or who to trust. That wasn't the case with Belal Hamideh. I felt to comfortable with my decision in choosing them. They made me feel like family and were there every step on the way. I highly recommend them to friends and family. They were the best decision!<//review>

<text>He helped me with two cases. One was my accident and the other was with an auto body shop.
With my accident him and his staff went above and beyond to making sure everything was scheduled with my doctors and all of my physical therapy.
In the end, I got a max payout without any trouble.
Since he was helping me out with my case, I had an incident with a body shop, and he quickly got it resolved.

I have nothing but great feedback for Mr. Hamideh, I was referred by a close friend and I was guaranteed amazing service. I was very pleased with this lawyer as well as his friendly and professional staff. They went above and beyond to help me understand my case and kept  me informed throughout the entire process. He kept me informed of the status of my case. His paralegal Maricela was such a great help they were both always in communications with me. Mr. Hamideh made this a very easy process for me. I would deininty be using Hamideh law in the near future and I highly recommend his services to anyone seeking legal help. He is an exceptional lawyer.</Text>

<text>Mr. Belal Hamideh is a legit lawyer. I was involved in a car accident while in a taxi cab an he settled my case in less than a year. All my medical bill paid with compensation for myself. He also gave me a discount. I will refer him to anyone involved in a car accident and continue using his services for myself. Received my settlement today. Thank you Belal Law!< /text>< response>

<Review>I had a car accident in March of 2018. They constantly kept me updated with what was going on with my case. They were so nice and always had a smile on their face. They made me feel like I was one of their own and I appreciate that more than they know. My settlement wasn't that much (wasn't a huge case to begin with) but they made sure I got the money I deserved. They broke down everything to make sure me and my family understood everything that was going on. Thank you guys so much!!! God forbid if I get in an accident again I know where to go.<//Review>< pics>

Unfortunately, last year, I was rear ended and my car was totaled. Snake Attorney’s come a dime a dozen which is why I feel they solicit so many clients through commercial ads and billboards.. In order to avoid that, when I needed representation, my Doctor referred me to a Law office he felt would do me a great service. However, I received everything but great or mediocre service and have therefore, had one of the worst experiences with an attorney this past year. I noticed Belal Hamideh in the building we both work, as I heard him speak casually to people and I could tell that he was an Attorney.  Since I was going through the stressful experience with my current attorney,  I verified his profession with the receptionist in hopes that I could receive a consultation. At that time, I wanted to switch attorneys; however, Belal explained to me that it was too late for me to switch Attorneys (so much time had passed, almost a year with current attorney). Without question, Belal provided me with advice free of charge, he treated me like a client (I wasn’t even his client), more so than my own Attorney. Because of this, I can honestly say his service is quality over quantity. Belal was genuine, respectful and an expert in his skill. When I was stuck in a rut with my dreadful Attorney, Belal helped me get through. I spoke to him a couple of times after our initial greeting and he advised me on how to close my case and deal with my Attorney who wouldn’t even answer my calls and only “preferred me to email.” Consequently, I won’t tell you who not to go to with my negative experience with the unprofessional attorney, but I can with confidence advise you to seek Belal Hamideh Law. Thanks Belal!<//review>

<text>On September 20th around 12:00 pm midnight I got in a very bad accident,it was a hit and flee.  The other guy ran a  red light and caused us to tbone him.  My sister got out the car because my seat belt got locked and noticed the other guy was drinking and driving.   He hit another car also and they started chasing him. There was police and ambulance that came and I had bruises.   I found Belal Hamideh on Yelp and he agreed to take my office even though it happened last year.   He is going to help me with medical treatment next to my work.   I thank Belal  for agreeing to take my case when other lawyers didn't want to help.</text>< user>

<text>After my accident, I didn't know what to do. My car was totaled, I didn't have any money coming in. I sure didn't have any health insurance. Belal walked me through the entire proces, he's very kind and helpful during this whole proces. He told me exactly what my claim was worth, and he told me he wouldn't settle until we got that. What was great about him was he told what the other side was offering all the time. I almost couldn't believe it when we ended up settling for even more than he told me my claim was worth. I highly recommend Belal Hamideh to anyone who's just been through an accident.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Belal provides grade A service.  I called Belal about a car accident, he was able to provide info over the phone.  The process was fairly easy, he took over all communication with the insurance company, was able to cover my medical bills, repairs, and lost wages.  If I ever have an issue I will reach out to him.</Review>< pictures>

I chose to take couple of minutes and compose an audit about "Belal Hamideh Law" firm. I do read on different audits. A companion of mine let me know about Belal Hamideh and in the wake of going by such a variety of law offices in LA, I chose to try it out. Belal Hamideh was so decent and exceptionally proficient. He helped me with my pile up. The greater part of the individuals that I know let me know that it was my deficiency on the grounds that I was making a left turn on a yellow (turning red) flag light on Beverly Blvd and Vermont Ave. That 99% flaw is the individual who makes the left turn. Well prepare to be blown away. that is not genuine. Belal Hamideh helped me. I am so glad. I kept their data and I as of now offered it to my loved ones. I recently suspected that it will be beneficial for you to try it out.< /text>

Mr hamideh is an excellent lawyer.  He does what he says he is going to do.   I used to have a lawyer before him that didn't help me.   I switched to him and it was a great decision.   He won my case at trial and I recommend him to everyone.<//text>

We came to Mr. Hamideh and his law firm with a very challenging case concerning my daughter's serious injuries. He was aggressive, knowledgeable, and involved with me and my family through the whole process. And he got us a great recovery! I would highly recommend him on any cases involving injuries to their children or themselves.Thumbs up for this law firm!!<//text>

I sincerely recommend the lawyer Belal Hamideh, he has just solved a car accident case which does not raise any power to recover anything from that case. But lawyer Belal could do it and I recovered the maximum in that case. Personally I recommend it and has a very professional and friendly staff< /Text>

I was injured in a severe car accident. I hired Belal Hamideh Law and after an initial consultation, Mr. Hamideh took my case. While being caring and compassionate with me he fought real hard for me and he got me a great settlement in my favor for my injuries.His staff members were very courteous and professional. ...he is also medically very knowledgeable with all types of injuries. .. I highly recommend him as your personal injury lawyer.<//Text>

<Review>I absolutely recommend this personal injury attorney! Just about a year ago I was driving when a huge truck ran through a red light and totalled my car. The other driver lied and actually tried to say I T-boned him. I was in pain, completely stressed out and worried beyond belief. I walked into Mr. Hamideh's office and they immediately calmed me and made sure I was well taken care of. Because of him, the other drivers' insurance company took responsibility and Belal Hamideh won a substantial recovery for me. I was very pleased and would use him for any future claims! 😆😆😆</Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
My friend Ricardo has an accident at his workplace and suffered a terrible injury on his shoulder. Aside of that, his now former employees were very abusive with him and thought they would got away with everything just because Ricardo doesn’t speak English well and because of his legal status. After looking for lawyers in LA and finding nothing but opportunists and scammers we came across Belal and his team. Ricardo was able to explain everything himself in Spanish and was supported since day one. Several months later he got his full compensation. What I want to highlight (and what motivated this review) was Belal’s level of commitment with my friend’s case. He knew that not only law was infringed but that an injustice was done to Ricardo, and unlike most of the lawyers he was more interested in making justice than in his paycheck...< /Review>

Attorney Belal definitely got me out of jam.  I got hurt at work, and my previous employer did not want to help me out.  Attorney Belal did not charge me a dime till he won my case.  He got my time off from work paid for, and all of my medical bills.  I highly recommend him, call him to find out how he can help you.<//Text>

Highly recommend attorney Belal to my friends in Harbor City, Very knowledgeable, and he is an attorney who gets the work done ! thought it would take about a 6 months or so for a case to settle, he finished the job within 3 weeks! and best of all his prices are so reasonable for the kind of litigation he offers !< /Review>

Last year I got hurt by a falling can of soup at the grocery store and I had to get stitches and miss work. Belal helped me get compensation to cover my medical bills and make up for my missed work. I definitely would recommend their services.<//text>

Have some questions posted regarding the integrity of LWCF leadership, still unanswered? I believe valid questions that the public deserves to know. A lot of hype about the brilliance of Pastor David Zamora's communication skills... If message and life don't line up, than this leadership is not a leadership to be trusted.... I am praying for the precious people of this congregation. It is time for the body of Christ to hold fast to God's word, and to exalt Jesus Christ...</text>

This man claims to have integrity but has none at all. He is a mandated reporter who failed to report his nieces abuse while they were under foster care with his mother . I had to find out through my daughter who the niece confidently told along with some of their so called leadership. I wonder what else he has ran cover for .< /Review>

The most wonderful pastor if you feel like hearing the Bible with great understanding Pastor David does that I had been looking for  A church body and a pastor who could explain things to me boom I walked  in Pastor David’s Church in it was just like an overwhelming feeling it’s like a Such a relief and when I sat down to listen to the message I knew at that moment God sent me there so if you guys are looking for that wow factor come to Living Way church and A pastor who is real not a fake not boring then Pastor David is your pastor<//Review>

The people at this church have been great every time I’ve gone, but the sermons are not so good sometimes. I have gone to this church a number of times. Pastor Zamora is sometimes pretty good when talking about the Bible in English, but when he starts talking about the original languages (Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic) he does not do so well. He has made up some words that I couldn’t find in the original languages when I checked (discipulos and mayagu aren’t Greek. Just try looking them up!) He says a lot of “meanings” that aren’t in *any* Hebrew or Greek dictionary, so he really doesn’t know the languages. Even so, he sometimes tries to make up his own translation of a verse and say that the Bibles we have are all wrong and act like he has some kind of authority about the Bible. I don’t think people who don’t know Hebrew or Greek should be teaching other people about it.<//review>

<review>A lot of knowledge of the Word with no life application. Sat in a couple of services no humility shown , & self exalted . Made me uncomfortable when he approached me to introduce himself, if I was his wife I definitely wouldn’t approve of his comments to another woman .< /review>< pictures>

Solid teaching with out all the hoopla and emotionalism. Recommend to every one who wants to learn the bible verse by verse in detail. Pastor David live by what he preaches. Definetelly a place to grow in your knowledge - if you think you know the bible, come and find out how much more you can learn. Big on prison ministries, drug and alcohol programs and teaching the word, including christian college across the street, and K12 starting also. Pastor David works tirelessly to bring you a fillet mignon of preaching.<//Review>

I love this church. They are like family to me. bcuz just how great and loving they are and they make you feel like family. I love the staff and the ministries they have. My kids absolutely love this church and that natters most to me. My pastor who I serve pastor David Zamora is beyond one of the BEST teacher I've ever listen to who teaches bout God. His gift God has given him is Amaizing. I've learned so much by his teaching. I highly recommend this church for any non believers. Come visit one Sunday service and you'll see for your self. I guarantee you you'll be touched and blessed by his word. God bless.< /text>

<Text>I usually go here to buy materials for my soaps. I find this store very clean; staff is always helpful. You can always get rewarded for shopping here, at least 20% off one item for purchases.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>They are practicing social distancing. They do have curbside so you can order online. This particular one was well stocked they have things for crafting, model kits, frames all kinds of frames they even make them there. They have tons of yarn pretty much anything also lots of decor for easter.<//text><Date>1617060893490<//Date><GmapID>0x80dd32f71f2038dd:0x2760ee4383cd5b1a< /GmapID><userid>106537288848719279499<//userid><user_name>Manuelv Vasquez<//user_name><Rating>5</Rating></record>

I rushed in for 1 specific item at 8:40pm. They close at 9pm and now it was 8:45. Ugh. I didn't want to but I asked a *boss type* person. Just as I expected, she let out a loud exasperated sigh and frowned at her watch. (Yes, she DID have a watch)
I think she was angry at me 🙄 🎶I tried not to make eye contact. Anyway, I went to the area she told me to go to. No such thing 😠 she did that to get rid of me 😡  #!%
✋🙄  Whatever dude. I can take a hint...and just as I was leaving....😢 another employee came to me and asked if she could help !!
And she did !!! With 2 minutes to spare !!! She was so kind and sweet. I didn't get her name. I really wish I had. (Yes, I would put her on blast right here 📣 yup !) Anyways, she was kinda tall, a pretty face, I think her hair was kinda a blonde-ish caramel color. She had a really nice demeanor about her. Not that the other was mean or anything..i get it,  but I'm 1 of those that notices people going the extra mile. I've NEVER complained about anyone to their higher ups, but I can't even think to tell you how many bosses I've called to report a job well done. I like doing that for some reason. I think they should be recognized. Two times, (because I was a regular customer) employees knew it was me. That's uncomfortable cuz then they're not themselves and trip over themselves trying to be helpful. It's always best they don't know. Michael's was good..as always..< /review>

I went there to buy a few items for my granddaughter's art class. A helpful employee told me the aisle I needed. I left with everything I was looking for. I almost always find exactly what I needed.< /text>

<Review>I love the framing department here. They’re awesome! I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to frame your own canvas but it’s hard. They have the right stretchers and make it a snap. They turned around this canvas of my kitty really quickly! They usually quote you 2 weeks but I think it took less than a week. And it’s perfectly square and hangs great!< /Review>< Pics>

But man did I rediscover what I've been missing out on : albeit now (socially distanced & masked) -- face-to-face, assistance of a smiling, friendly person (able to rapidly pivot responses based on oft nuanced, cultural sensibilities: such as age, gender, language, profession, hobbies, etc -- without needing to first fill out lengthy and sometimes intrusive questionnaires __ that last forever).

Excellent, friendly (helpful) customer service -- what a pleasure to shop here....... even if I didn't have anything specific to buy.

Just to relax, cool down in their A/C  -- perusing art & craft supplies : spawning ideas, making wish lists for later.

Even swing by only to engage in meaningless conversation over art product...... 🙂</Review>< pictures>

<review>WARNING! I made an appointment for 6:15pm. Showed up at 6:10pm. The sales person seemed to be nice as he was telling us that they were just talking about us before we got there. I have no idea what they were saying but whatever. We signed up for an account online in order to upload pictures to print on canvas. It took a half hour to get an account set up because we were waiting for confirmation. We finally get the account set up. We upload our pictures. They can not see them in their system. Then we were told that the reason is because we didn’t log into Aaron Brothers. Well ok. We then try that and it directs us back to Michael’s. We’re back to square one. Mind you there were two people working. There was one other customer. I’m not sure if she had an appointment but I know I did. The other sales rep was not helping, just the one guy working was attending to the other customer then periodically say something to me about the patriot act abs my husbands tshirt. Not helping at all. Anyhow, his attention was with the other customer for the now HOUR that we are there trying to figure this out with no direction or help. He then with out asking grabs my phone. We are in a pandemic. I don’t want someone’s hands on my personal things. Pandemic or not you just don’t grab someone’s phone with out asking. I had an absolute horrible experience and was willing to pay over $600 to get my prints and framing done. I will obviously not ever go back to this company. I am willing to pay more if I have to in order to be treated decently.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dd32f71f2038dd:0x2760ee4383cd5b1a</Gmap_id><response>None< /response>< Name>

Terrible customer service and shopping experience! I found a whole bunch of frames marked down placed on the Clearance, and the clerk told us the name of the manager "Roy"- he couldn't honor the price even it was marked down because there was a problem that was not allowing him to sell it to us without giving us any apparent reason. Gillian the clerk couldn't help us either in answering my questions, all she said is that she couldn't help us at all! From the manager to the clerk...How did you work at a place where you can't help your customers?  to answer any questions or even honor the mark down price of an item YOU placed out there, it make no sense at all to me. There was even the same exact items in the reg shelves at reg price you couldn't sell to us at the mark down price, but yes you could sell those at the regular price- the same exact frames that were not marked down-but not the ones in the Clearance. You could've just honor that price in a different item at the same cost or less. I even forgot to use my coupon on my purchase because I was very upset with the poor customer service and also my husband couldn't use their restroom there. They want your business but they cannot accommodate or help their customers. If you expect good service, this is NOT the place.<//Text>

<text>Was not very happy with Michaels, not there fault on one issue though. I went in looking for some ceramic pumpkins for Halloween, there were none. I understand in retail they have to move on to the next holiday before the one coming up has not yet come, ok my fault. Next i was looking for a step stool unfinished to use as a crafting project, only bird houses did i find, very bad selection of wood crafting media.<//text>< date>

Michael's is great. The family really benefits from the projects I bring home from Michael's.  During these stay in times, a lot of days are passing with little to show and be proud of. Having art or just creative routines in our daily lives is so underrated. Having a sense of accomplishment and individuality helps maintain balance. Very important. Thanks Michael's. Thank you for being open.< /Text>

<review>I had to get a replacement glass for one of my framed pictures; the glass had cracked during the moving process. The Aaron Brothers sales associate cut a new piece of 14- by 18-inch replacement plastic, which is much less breakable than glass, in a few minutes, and I was on my way. Cost was a few dollars more than glass, but worth it. Excellent service.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Couldn't get anyone to help us find an item and the teenage cashiers couldn't stop gossiping long enough to say hello. Maybe some retraining is needed especially since what I was buying could easily be purchased on Amazon without the frustration.</Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><pics>None< /pics><UserId.>103580795622093245217</UserId.><review>This review specifically goes out to Anthony in the Custom Framing department.

I was tasked by the firm I work for to get my diplomas framed. A coworker recommended Hobby Lobby, so naturally that was my first stop (went to the one across the way from this Michaels location). HORRIBLE experience at Hobby Lobby. I was observing the frame options at hobby lobby when the man working the framing department came out and sarcastically said, if you were ready you should have rung the bell. He asked what I was looking for, and I explained that I was wanting to get my diplomas framed. He was quick to dismiss any of my inquiries into custom framing and instead was pushing me to buy the 50% off ready made frames—um, if I wanted ready made frames, I would have started there... He seriously would not let it go, and kept insisting I look at the frames already on the floor and go with those. To say I was put off was an understatement. He asked if I had gotten my bachelor's degree. It wasn't until I told him I was looking to frame my Masters AND Law degree that he took me seriously and said, "oh SH**, okay, well if you really want you can do the custom framing..." It was a horrible experience and I decided to take my business elsewhere.

When I got to Michaels—a COMPLETE 180 from how I was treated in Hobby Lobby. There was no questioning of why I'd want to get custom framing over ready made frames or even of whether I could afford the service. Anthony was so ready and eager to help and exemplified incredible patience. He made great recommendations, walked me through the process and talked me through color options. I also observed how he was working with the customer just previous to us, and saw how he was incredibly professional and understanding to all of us who were waiting at the Framing department. It took me a good 20 minutes to make a decision on my framing options, but Anthony seemed to really understand what an important decision this was—the diplomas are more than a piece of paper; they represent years of sacrifice and hard work.

I will definitely be recommending this Michaels and specifically the framing department to any of my friends who are looking to get their diplomas framed. Honestly, give Anthony a raise because he is most deserving.< /review>< username>

It was Black Friday in Michael's and it was a great well oiled running machine. Long line but it was moving! They scan your items while in line and then take a card up to the register that has everything your buying on that card. Cashiers were friendly, people in line were friendly and there were lots of deals going on. If you didn't have coupons, the cashier did and she added those discounts to the savings you were already getting. Great deals!<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Wonderful Framing. Michael's has framed three items for me. I always wait for the 70% off coupon that appear in the newspapers from time to time. Their team is very creative and helps me explore lots of framing options. Loved that they added screws to the plaque framed here. Nice detail.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dd32f71f2038dd:0x2760ee4383cd5b1a</gmap_id></record>

Place for crafting supplies. Lots of sales. Always check online for discounts before purchasing anything. Sign up with your email too as you can get coupons. Sometimes you can even get a 60% coupon in an email.</Review>

Awful stores. Lied to my face.

I had ordered online for pickup and my order last minute gets cancelled. So I ask the person working there (some young guy) if I could do anything to get my things. He said if I ordered online really quick he would be able to give it to me. So I did that. I go back up there and they tell me they can’t give it to me until it’s processed in the system. Which takes a full day.

Also note that I asked for a poster board and the one they picked out for me was scratched.< /text>

Clean, stocked and organized store, and the staff was pleasant tonight. I found exactly what I was looking for and a few other items as well. I was in and out in no time: just the way I like it at the end of my day! 😊<//Text>

It's always fun to be in this store but sad I can't get all that I want each visit! Whenever I want to get a craft project done this is the place I go. They get coupons with fairly large discounts off too. Looking forward to my next time there!</review>

This place always has supplies I need for whatever small projects I happen to be doing at the time. My girlfriend and I can always find decent deals for quality product here. We will continue to be faithful customers of this establishment.< /Text>

<Text>Get the app, and use them coupons. If you don't want to make a trip in vain, call in advance to make sure they have stock of what you want. Especially when it comes to Art Supplies, my medium is watercolor, and it's really hard to find brush sets and quality paper.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Great prices if you're a artist crafter jewelry designer. Download the app and get a major discount, like 50% or 40%. I'm not a bot 😂. And I don't work for their company. I got a great deal on some awesome jewelry fixtures and want to share it with the world.💃🌍❤️😁< /Review>< user>

I was so happy about the savings. Oh, as I was paying, there was another customer upset about not being able to return his item (I'm guessing) and he began to curse and the cashier. Three of the employees went back and forth with him shortly as he leaving. Ladies next time do not engage. Just let him leave peacefully (for you all at least).</text>< Pictures>

Went today,  line was super long but all registers were open and it moved quickly.  I needed to get a cricut blade, it was $35, I found it on the Cricut website for #20.99 so Michaels priced matched.  So that was awesome!</Review>

I love Michaels! They have every cradty thing you could think of! And during summer they have camp creativity for kids! It is an awesome programthat happens on Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays all summer long! They do a different craft each day and each week has a different theme. Classes are $3 each class per child. It is so much fun watching the little ones...and a great bonding experience. Great idea Michaels!!!!<//review>

This is a review of their summer crafts program, Camp Creativity. I've been taking my twin daughters and they have been having a blast. While others are involved, the primary person my daughters work with is Ms. Kim. She is as warm and loving as you could hope for in a person. No matter the number and age range, Ms. Kim never seems to get flustered and my girls LOVE her. She is super dynamic and I think this is a great program, in large part by the loving and enthusiastic way that Ms. Kim treats all the kids.</text>

<Text>It's a nice enough Michaels if you like Michaels.  Michaels plays a lot of games with its pricing and coupons, which works for people who like that kind of thing, clipping coupons, paper or digital, going back multiple times, or getting in line mutiple times, to get the coupon discounts on more than one item. But it's a pain for someone who just wants to buy art or craft supplies for a good price. They inflate the original price, then put the item on "sale" so their coupons don't work on it. If they know their price, why not just charge it instead of all the pricing/coupon manipulation. To be a successful Michaels shoppper and get the best prices, you really have to master their sale/coupon/pricing scheme. Never shop at Michaels without going on line first to get the coupons of the day.  Good luck!< /Text></record>

<Review>JoAnn’s deals are better than Michaels. The employees always seem to run away when I need help finding something and when I do finally catch one and ask for help they just shoo me away and say “over there” like gee, thanks I know exactly where over there is. Hobby Lobby is where it’s at though, the people there are extremely helpful and knowledgeable on everything crafts and they ask each other for help if they don’t know the answer. Maybe Michaels employees could go over there and learn a thing or two about customer service. Working retail myself I know it gets busy and overwhelming at times, but it’s not impossible to do the part of your job that is to literally help customers.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dd32f71f2038dd:0x2760ee4383cd5b1a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
For the most part I like this store and find its staff to be very friendly and helpful. Around Christmas time when they have so much seasonal merchandise they can be less able to direct you to what you are looking for, but the other 10 months of the year, they're very able. Since it's a smaller store, I find it better when I know what I need, because I can get in and out quickly. Their selection of products is good, and I rarely need to go elsewhere for most small projects.</Review>

<Text>This is the typical craft store. Carries quite a few items that you need but nit all of them.  It's not as classy as Hobby Lobby acriss the street but you will most things here.

The staff are rude and you can never find one to help you.  The lines are always long as tgey usually only have one cashier.<//Text>< rate>

I've been shopping at this particular Michaels 4 years. They always have a very good array of the kinds of things I'm looking for regardless of the occasion. I am a jewelry designer and I find many things to use in my designs and things I need to put them together at Michaels. I really love this store, it has excellent merchandise, very friendly helpful staff and anything you could possibly want or need for any occasion.< /text>

Go here all the time for wilting fondant. I like now that i just give them my number since I'm a rewards member to get their 40%off did out instead of searching online for one. Makes that nice. Service is good, sometimes a little slow at times.</Review>

They only had two cashiers for a long while than finally 2 more cashiers signed on. The way they have the store arranged the cashiers really cannot see how long the line really is so that they can call for help. Hope this changes soon before the holiday rush.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd32f71f2038dd:0x2760ee4383cd5b1a<//gmap_id></record>

So Michaels is not only a wonderful place to shop but a creative place to also give gifts to family members instead of just buying them in the store they're so personal the family members Little League has tears coming to their eyes. Michaels thank you so much for making all my gifts so personal and Timeless through all these years. Thank you for all your wonderful people that serve your company and your customers I will always help us at the counter with most kindness and are just the best representative cereal company. Thanks again Michaels.</review>

I hate the store.! But God knows my little girls love the place. So by default I must recant my first statement and say thank god for Michaels.  The place makes them happy and means the world to me. Everything they're artsy- fartsy, little creative hearts can think of is there.  Great store.  Great employees. Actually very clean.</Text>

It's not a big store but you can definitely get lost in it for hours! Staff really know there stuff, lots of great discounts to be had. You can also buy your Sharpies your calligraphy pens and various other gel pens one at a time or in a pack. Great store!</text>

<Text>This store is always full of people, love the sales they have every other week, they always send me an email where i can get and item 30% or 40% off sometimes even 50% or 60% off depending on the holidays or season i believe...but i love the bakeware section its big. I go every once in a while...mainly to look at the puzzle section.
Great store though<//Text>< pics>

This place is amazing !!  To bad.  They don't have all the different colors of markers..  And this place is too far for me to ride my bike to shop here this Monday...  Is Michaels open this Monday? ???  Hehe.  Don't want to go there and see this store close...  That would be sad and embarrassing...  I plan to go here this Monday😭😭😭😂😂❤❤😢😢</Review>

I went on a Sunday and was very disappointed at the short staffing problem they were seeming to have . I went for 3 specific things so instead of walking down each isle I went to look for someone to help me. After searching for 2 hours, I gave up and interrupted the 2nd cashier because the first wouldn’t look in my direction even after saying excuse me A LOT. I was THEN told the wrong location for what I was looking for. Like seriously?! I ended up leaving and going to the Downey location. Much better.< /Text>

A good crafts store, I'd recommend going for any artist that wants art supplies at a reasonable price. They have a good amount of supplies.</review>

< review>
I've gone in this store 2 times in the last week the first time that I was in I was looking at some framing the framing is advertised 70% off so I went through the whole thing that took like an hour and a half and I got a price quote for my three pictures to be framed and my total came out to be around $130 each I'm told that that's 70% off so that kind of leaves me to wonder who's paying that much to have one picture framed at Michaels. When I asked the gentleman working there he said it's not really exactly like it's 70% off because it's 70% off of the manufacturer's price which is not what they actually sell them for so while it says its 70% off it's not exactly 70% off. I had some things that I had wanted to purchase from walking around the store while I was waiting for the frame price quote so I go to purchase them and I'm standing in a line of about maybe six or seven people there's one person only on the cashier so we're waiting waiting waiting we were in line for about 15 minutes and at this point I had been in the store for over 2 hours with a three-year-old which doesn't really work out very well so I had to abandon the things I wanted to purchase and leave. I went back into the store today and unfortunately only we found some of the things that I wanted to purchase I'm using the time while my son is at school to go to Michaels since I was already expecting a long line and that's exactly what I found the line that I had to wait in for quite some time in order to pay. Long story short Michaels has cute things I want to buy them but I can't go there with my child because when things takes so long when you thought you could just run in and grab a quick decoration and pay you're going to be in line for quite a while waiting it seems. Maybe I caught them on a bad week maybe that's how it always is I'm not sure and I probably won't find out.</review>

I love Michaels, and can literally get lost in the store! They also usually have digital and prinatable coupons to use on your every visit. That's wonderful, however they are a bit pricey. Not too bad, but its worth it.< /Text>

One of my favorite Michaels. Lots of fun crafts and the lines move fairly quickly. They could still use a few more associates on the floor however.< /Review>

They've got all the craft supplies you'll need, plus staff to answer questions. There is a always a sale going on, but even then everything is priced pretty low. Stuff here is about the quality you'd expect for the price, but they do carry high end products too. This location has lots of available parking, which is always good.< /Text>

This is the closest Michaels to my house so it's the one I tend to go to the most it's always well organized all the signs are in Clear View the staff are always friendly and willing to help with coupons for extra savings and answer any questions you have parking's in a shopping center so it's pretty good.</review>

Do not, I repeat, do not buy here without a 40% off coupon. As it is, the prices are extremely overpriced. Think of it this way, if they can still make a profit at 40% off, what kind of racket are they running for those who don’t use a coupon???<//review>

This Michaels has everything you're going to need for crafts. It has a clearance section. And they changed stuff seasonally so you're always ready for what's coming.</Text>

Smaller location than the next closest, but it's always good to have options. Still a good selection, size notwithstanding.</text>

I like the 40% off coupon they feature along with other coupons. Whenever I need framing or a hard to get craft item it's Michaels first. Although they dif not have the large macreme I wanted the clerk directed me to who did have it.<//review>

They have one hot cashier who scans coupons for me. I don't know if they all do that but anyone that saves me 50% is instantly attractive to me.<//review>

The cashier was kinda rude and lazy, she took forever to give me my change and asked me to walk my basket to the other side , instead of just taking it next to her . The other cashier told me I couldn't share my coupons with my mom. Its weird because j never had a issue with that. It might be because of the holidays.</review>

<text>Always a great place to shop for any craft project.

One thing that was evident was a redesign/restructure of the isles and products.  The Sticker selection had a decrease in the variety and overall amount of product.

All isles appeared to undergo a layout update so, it took a moment to get my bearings.

As I said earlier, you can't go wrong here for any craft project.

Good luck and have fun!<//text>< user_id>
