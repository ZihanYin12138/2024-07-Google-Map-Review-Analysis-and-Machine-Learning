They also always return my car looking better than I left it. I’ve been going to Adam’s for around 3 years and wouldn’t consider anyone else in the area to service my car.< /review><gmapID>0x80c2ba479cd8ed25:0x86c73b4fae77df43<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I just moved to California from Texas & my dad used to always take his vehicles in Texas to an Adams there & I thought why not? So thankful I did because I got the best customer service & they didn’t try to charge me an arm and a leg for their service like other places in the area. They took my car in at a short notice. Also, everyone at Adams was really nice & professional. Thank you! This will be my new place to go for any future car troubles!</Text>< pictures>

I spoke with Adam (the owner) on the phone, and he brought me in with no worries of getting my car fixed right away. Great customer service, very reasonable pricing, and amazing job with the work. If you have an issue with your car, I definitely recommend Adam’s shop. Thanks Adam!</review>

We have used many good auto repair clinics over four decades leaving them only when they were sold or went out of business. I am quite familiar with cars, how they operate and what's needed when there's a failure. We are fortunate to have found Adam's Car Repair that tops them all. We have found Adan to be extremely knowledgeable, fully trustworthy, always suggesting ways to save money while using top quality parts, and fair in pricing. When you add his smiling charm, his remembering who you are and your car's history, his full and accurate explanation of what's going on and what is needed, plus the cleanliness of his shop and the warmth's and expertise of his crew, do yourself a favor and reduce your anxiety when your car needs repairing: use Adam's Complete Repair Service no matter how far you live from Culver City.<//review>

My wife and I had been taking our cars to Adam's for years. He and his crew were always nice, respectful and most importantly, HONEST! We ended up getting new cars and had not been to the shop in a few years. My wife and I both needed to get our vehicles inspected and have some paperwork filled out for something so we decided to go back to Adam's. He recognized us even after not being there for a few years. The guy does great work, is reasonabl and as I stated earlier in my review, he is honest. He won't try to take advantage. That's a rarity in auto repair shops now a days. This is the place to go for auto repair!<//text>

<Review>Adam's Complete Auto Repair is the best automotive mechanic I have been to in LA. I have been his customer for about a year and have been very impressed.

Customer Service:
- Adam took extra time near closing to replace a turn signal bulb, which I could get pulled over for if I left it unchanged. (I don't ever want to keep him at the store longer than he should be there, but I am very thankful that he went out of his way to do this.)
- Adam takes time, though he is high in demand, to listen to what needs to be done to your car.
- Adam is also very honest about what is best for your car and the work that he does to your car.
- Always very friendly

Expertise:
- Adam is knowledgeable, experienced, and also completes his work very quickly.
- I have never had any problems with any work that was done to my car or any of the equipment installed on my car. It has all functioned well.

Payment:
- Hitting on honesty again, Adam is also very knowledgeable about pricing and has been very gracious in my experience. I've searched around before, looking at different quotes for brakes, tires, fluid changes, etc., and Adam's cost is low if not in some cases the lowest.

Summary:
From Adam's great work in the past, honesty, and expertise, I trust him to recommend what my car needs, perform the service, and I trust him with pricing as well. If you live within a reasonable distance of his shop, I highly recommend him as your automotive mechanic.<//Review><pics>None<//pics></record>

<text>Adam's Complete Auto Repair is highly recommended. I have taken my car to them twice and Adam has been very thorough with letting me know what was needed for my car. He charged me less for what he originally quoted. He also fixed something on my car that was a minor issue and didn't even charge me. Today I went for a brake flush and he told me that I needed new tires and raised my car up for me to see exactly why I needed new tires. I appreciated the extra info and giving me a hands on experience letting me know how important it would be for me to replace my tires. Adam and his team are very cordial and as a woman living alone in Los Angeles, I did not feel like I was being taken advantage of at all. I appreciate them!< /text>< pictures>

< review>
This is the ONLY mechanic I trust in SoCal. Honest with what work needs to be done, fair prices and goes out of their to make sure the client is happy and the car at hand is taken care of. As a woman who has had mechanics take advantage of my "lack of car expertise" it's refreshing to have this type of mechanic close by. I'll be moving to the south bay soon and I will still make the trek up to the westside to have this place look after my baby.<//review>

Amazing services and a patient non-judgmental team.
This mechanic communicates clearly abt one's options and discusses/agrees on a labor and parts costs in advance. No surprises,  just ensuring his customers are able to drive in their cars.
Very much appreciated,  thanks!
Spanish and English speaking an absolute plus!<//review>

Adam is a really amazing auto mechanic. I came in to get a new timing belt for my civic and he took care of it with absolute professionalism. He worked hard, fast, and absolutely efficient. Any one who needs a car mechanic should definitely take it to this location. He actually took the time to get to know me as a person and explained all the procedures he would take repair my car. Even better, he kept his prices low. I highly recommend this auto shop.< /text>

Adam is the man! Honest guy who does amazing work for a great price. I got engine work done on my '05 civic and he even fixed a few cosmetic issues at no extra cost. My car felt just like new and looked even better than when I dropped it off. Do yourself a favor and take your cars to Adam!<//review>

I have been meaning to write this review for a while, as I have gone to Adam several times for repairs over the years! Adam has always been super honest, straightforward and affordable. He did a diagnostic on my old car when it broke down & helped me to prioritize what needed to get done within my budget. I have since taken cars to him to look over before purchasing - he always gives me an honest answer and tells me what he thinks. Recently, we took my bf's car to him & he fixed a small issue & didn't ask for payment (we gave him $$... but STILL!) Adam & his crew are just stand-up guys & I will definitely continue to take my cars there!< /text></record>

I've been going to Adam for 3 years now. On top of doing stellar work every single time, Adam's best quality is his honesty. He always goes the extra mile to give me all the information I need to make the best decision for my car, based on what I am able to afford.

If you're like me and are absolutely clueless about cars, yet need some peace of mind....look no further....go see Adam!<//Review>

<text>Highly recommended. I recently had work done on my 97 Isuzu truck and they told me exactly what was wrong with my car, they took me step by step and described to me in detail what needed to be replaced and how they fixed it.  They did not only do a great job fixing my car, but also gave me recommendations of other things that may need to be replaced in the future due to how old my car is.
They are trusty worthy and take good care of their customers.<//text><user_name>Juan Rodriguez<//user_name>< date>

Adam and his team are absolutely amazing. Brought my 2000 gmc Sonoma in and they took care of issues a lot of other mechanics wouldn't even touch. Estimates were spot on and they were so efficient in getting the car back to me. Would give more than 5 stars if I could.<//Review>

Visited Adam's recently after having to jump start a car with a dead battery. Adan quickly diagnosed the problem, explained everything very clearly to us, and then changed out the battery. He even gave the old car some small touch-ups free of charge -- he tacked up the loose bumper and wiped off a big scratch left on the side of the car after an unfortunate encounter with a parking garage pole. Thank you so much for the great service!< /Review>

Honest guy. This shop has been in business for about 5 years or so. A/C wasn't working. He went in and told me what was wrong with it. Car repairs are always pricey but he gave me a decent price. He isn't pushey and when I asked about other parts he said they were fine and did not need replacing...showing me he is not looking to rip customers off. When I asked to see the damaged parts afterwards and keep it he said no problem and showed me the damaged parts afterwards taken from my vehicle. Overall, quality work with good prices and good customer service!

At the very minimum, free inspection and worth checking out for whatever is wrong with your car.< /text>

<text>He does great work and has great attention to detail. I initially brought my car to have its brakes replaced, but upon inspection, he noticed that my car was in need of a new Motor Mount as well. I was  reluctant to have my Motor Mount replaced at first because my car still had low mileage, but a friend of mine who was into cars confirmed later that day that my Motor Mount was  indeed broken. I was glad Adam identified the problem initially, so  I was happy to bring the car back to have the Motor Mount replaced. He did a superb job for both the brakes and Motor Mount.

For both services, the prices i got was a really great deal. I'd recommend you try him when you're in the area. He's very personable and can be trusted.<//text><resp>None< /resp>< Date>

I don’t know how to fix cars and I’m not a mechanic so for me it’s very important that I can trust the guy working on my car. I’ve been to Adams auto repair a number of times the guys that work there were quickly and and the price they quote is what they charge for me when I get there. If I was looking for a place in the neighborhood that I can trust this would be the one for me< /Review>

<review>Adam's Complete Auto Repair is the most dishonest auto repair shop I have ever seen. Dishonesty prevails above that which is normally expected from this type of business. This is the absolute worst place.
Adan (the owner) is dishonest, he and his team provide the worst customer service, Adan uses cheap quality and aftermarket products and his prices are always more expensive compared to other auto repair shops.
A case in point: I took my car there on 4/24/2017 for new front and back brake pads. I paid $461.12 for this job. I left and when I got to my first red light, I noticed that my pedal was going all the way to the floor (which is an issue that was not an issue prior to arriving at Adam's Complete Auto Repair that morning).
I went back and spoke to Adan, the owner. He drove the car and the pedal goes to the floor but it stops, so there is no issue....no joke he said that. I explained again that the pedal is going all the way to the floor.
I was again told that the pedal going to the floor is NOT AN ISSUE! On the way back to the auto shop after many instances the pedal going to the floor this idiot Adan reluctantly fixed the pedal.
Coming out of the auto shop the brakes sounded worse.

But I know new pads, etc, often squeak or make noise for the first 100 miles or so, so I tried to ignore it. Four mounts later, it's still making that sound, so I call Adan and he said bring it back. I leave work early to get there before they close. He ask me, has the car been sitting without being driven. I say, no I drive it everyday. He say there's a little bit of rust that could be causing it to squeal. I reiterate what I'm hearing is not just a squeal but a grinding and knocking and was getting worse and worse.

So I spent another Saturday sitting in his shop, but optimistic it will finally be resolved. It's not. After redoing the whole process according to him the sound is worse than ever and I am at my wit's end as I already paid so much and spent so much time on this simple repair.

Finally I took my car to another auto mechanic and he finds the problem immediately. Adan (Adam's Complete Auto Repair) use the cheapest pads that do not come with hardware, so he use the old barely compatible rusty worn hardware which has been scraping the calipers.

If I can just give my two sents, don't expect whatever issue you had with auto to be prepared properly the first time. If you have time for multiple trips to Adam's Complete Auto Repair to repair the same issue then this might be the place for you but Adan will charge you again and argue as you may, if you want your car, you will lose.

Don't expect the estimate of time to fix is even close to the time he takes. Price gougers. Abuser of customers with serious auto issues and with no ability to take car elsewhere unless you afford hefty towing charges once you figure out his deceitful practices. I wouldn't even come here for simple oil change.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1537407841111, 'text': 'Dan,\nWe take each and every review at Adam\'s Complete Auto Repair seriously. At our business, we take great pride putting our customers first by meeting their individualistic needs. In your case, we offered you the same high quality parts that we recommend to everyone; however, you took the initiate to refuse our recommendation and pleaded for us to search for a part that would be suitable to your economical situation. When a person buys auto parts that are lower priced, it is expected to encounter a lower life span or issues due to the amount you payed for it  If you had an issue with the part upon purchase, there are warranties that come with the part that we had already told you about. Also, Adam\'s Complete Auto Repair does not tolerate any form of inappropriate behavior that targets individuals because we value respect for everyone. Using derogatory terms such as "idiot" to describe Adan, you digress from Yelp\'s purpose, which is a website used to provide an analysis that critiques a business\' customer service. We will not have any additional comments on your exaggeration of the situation and support your decision to find a different auto repair shop. Good luck.'}<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba479cd8ed25:0x86c73b4fae77df43<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>I ordered a taco salad with meat. It was more American style than Mexican style with the ingredients used. It tasted good. I'll try a sandwich the next time I go. It's in an industrial area so it's not the most obvious, but there are signs.< /text><userid>102526432032289515233< /userid>< Time>

Excellent sandwich & service.  Full leaf lettuce - not that shredded iceberg junk.  Fresh, soft sliced bread, ripe tomatoes, etc. They allow you to order a half sandwich too - my fave for a small or late lunch.  Even the half came with a perfect dill pickle spear & green pepper on the side.  Friendly people. I will be back!</Review>

<text>I feel so very lucky that I found out this marvelous gastronomic delight. Let's be honest, not all of us are looking for nolowgo food; no taste, calories or delight; low fat and calories, low carbs blah blah blah. I work hard and I want to enjoy my lunch. Today I remembered my youth, my Dad, my sisters and I ate like I was there again. I had a REAL roasted turkey sandwich with cranberry and dressing, not processed, homogenized, pasteurized stolen kitty food passing as turkey. My workmate had the steak and pepper sandwich. He is so sweet he said his wife would enjoy it so he took home half. Might have been his way out of a cheap Friday dinner, but he enjoyed his meal also. The prices are fair and it was busy around 12:30. I will go again. Thank you for a delightful experience.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808f95b3ef05c111:0x74536056a6b26766<//gmapID></record>

Love the Chicken Caesar Sandwich. Great variety all very fresh, generous portions. Even if you encounter a long line don't turn around you will have your order shortly. Im the one who will turn around in a flash so trust me on this. They take care of you. Feel free to Tip they deserve & earned it in every order i have made. The location must be 1 reason it's over by 4pm daily. Enjoy.</text>

<review>Pop's is AHHHH-MAZING! This is forever, my go to sandwich spot. If variety is the spice of life then pops is spicy AF. A plethora of different soups, salads, chips, & beverages [including bottled BEER]. But naturally, it's the service & the sandwiches that are absolutely GOLDEN. Speedy, scrumptious, & served up with a smile. Whether you go for a pops signature or create your own sandwich, you really cannot go wrong.

COUPLE NOTES:

-Pops is only open M-F until 4pm
-The lunch hours get BUSY, so call in your order ahead of time if you happen to be pressed for time
-They offer catering as well, OFFICE PARTY ANYONE?
-DON'T FORGET TO ASK FOR A POPS STAMP CARD, so you can get your 10th sandwich for FREE!! [cause you'll be back for more, trust me] :D</review>< pics>

Haven't been by here in a few years, so was hoping it was still good. Unfortunately, the sandwich I was craving, The Ensanada Chicken sandwich was not nearly as good as before. Not saying it was terrible but it was just not as good. That being said  prices are very reasonable and even though it was lunch time, it was not crowded. It's ok for a quick bite.<//Review>

<text>Took my autistic daughter to get a haircut. The stylist was so kind and patient with her during the whole process. She stopped to make sure my daughter was comfortable a few times and did a great job on the cut. My daughter wanted shorter hair so we looked up pictures and she chose the style she wanted. I showed the picture to the stylist and she made it happen. The stylist also took the time to show my daughter the clippers before she used them on her. The stylist put them against her own hand to show my daughter that they won't hurt and let her get used to the noise for a minute. Definitely would go back!<//text>< pictures>

This place like a lot of chain places is hit and miss.  Some do exactly what I like but then my next visit they are gone.  Some seem to do what they think should be done.  So where I wanted short is long and the longer  parts are short.  When they do too short i then got to grow it out a month to get where i like it.  So you got this haircut your unhappy with for a month.</text>

I'd like to give credit for Chris who works there. I always call in to make sure he is working and never have to wait more than 15 minutes. The best thing is that he is incredibly personable and knows everything about you and what you like. He is also incredibly knowledgeable about hair and will tell you what works best and what doesn't and gives recommendations. He always makes me feel good when I go in.</text>

Could have taken a little more time to really finish my sons hair cut. My stylist was nice and did well. Their pricing for any coloring is ridiculously high, actually more that what I'd pay at a high end salon eo I'm dyeing my hair elsewhere.< /Review>

My toddler got his hair cut here a few months ago and, even though I didn't like the haircut, the woman got him to stay still. So I was happy regardless. But today we went in and the woman with short, blue hair did such a poor job that I'm mad they even charged us. She butchered his hair and I have to take him somewhere else now to fix it. She cut the front of his hair and left everything else on top long and uncut. How she has a job cutting hair is beyond me. Update: We went to Barber Johns on Nord Ave. and they fixed it! They were also shocked that we were charged for his "haircut". Sean, the barber, got him to sit still and did a great job. Even my three year old was happy when he looked in the mirror.</Text>

I took my nephew and son here to get their hair cut. The lady Kelly did my 2 year old son's hair and she was really good and super nice, but the lady that did my nephew's hair was a total b**ch. She messed up on his hair did not turn out the way we told her to do it. While my 4 year old nephew was talking to her and actually trying to have a little conversation with her she didn't even talk or say anything back to him. Everyone else was nice and welcoming except for her. For that I did not feel like she deserved a tip and I only tipped the lady that did my son's hair. I will be back but will only let Kelly do the kids hair.< /Text>

<text>I think I got a good haircut, I'll have to check after I wash and comb tomorrow.
Several PROBLEMS at this location.
1- I made appointment online but told wait would be 10min . Wrong it was over 40, last one taken even though several people came in and taken before me

2 - I was NOT given the hot towel treatment which Supercuts advertised.

3 - I was NOT shown my haircut after she was done so I have no idea what the back looks like.</text>< Response>

It seems that the primary complaint is that people that call ahead get priority.  Soo yeah... Call ahead... it's a pretty simple concept and one that I have gotten used to.  If I know I am getting a haircut after work I call them an hour before I get off to let them know I'm coming in so I don't have to wait around forever, if you need a last minute cut, this probably isn't the stop for you as they are very popular.  Very friendly, great cut.< /Text>

<review>The Mangrove location. My understanding was Supercuts was to be a no appointment, walk-in service, get your hair cut by professional stylists, within very little time.  Every visit the first question is "do you have a scheduled appointment?"  Although I have always got great haircuts the continuous long wait (1-hour) of being put on the back burner as a walk-in to those who schedule a time or schedule a time and don't show up.  The experience of hearing the same names called 3-4 times, show up 40-minutes late, and still receive priority service. Sure they assist the walk-ins, as long as there are no scheduled appointments. Supercuts has proven the walk-in service is not their mission - appointments are, walk-ins are not a priority.<//review>< gmapID>

I call to make an appointment they set my appointment and when I got there the girl on front told me we don't make appointment.  I call to set an appointment because I don't want to wait.  Even with the appointment I have to wait 45 minutes that's ridiculous.</Text>

My family has been going to Deccan Dental for years now. We love Dr Nanjapa and his team. They're really good + thorough with adults + gentle with kids. The best part, no unnecessary waiting around, they run a pretty tight ship. Great COVID precautions.< /Text>

I NEVER write reviews, but feel compelled to write one now. I’ve been a patient of Dr. Nanjapa’s for years—10+ years. I live in SF, but find he is worth the drive.  I used to be a ball of nerves in the dental chair, but over the years, I have come to trust the experience will be mostly comfortable. I recommend him to anyone with sensitive teeth. I find him to be knowledgeable, trustworthy, and personable. The office and exam rooms have always been beyond pristine, but my recent visit was in the setting of Covid, and the modifications the practice has put in place really shows that they are prioritizing patient safety and comfort. His staff is attentive and efficient.</text>

My first visit to a dentist in these troubled times couldn’t have been any better! Dr. Nanjappa and his staff put my mind at ease the moment I walked in, starting with checking my temperature. They are friendly, thorough, efficient and professional in their interaction. Glad that I chose Deccan Dental!< /review>

After having care at a previous clinic that didn't sit with me right (no safety glasses in my appointments), I was relieved to have been connected with Dr. Nanjapa's team. From the moment I sat in their chair and telling them about my tooth (that had a recent filling done that still was causing pain and I couldn't chew), I appreciated to see they tried multiple times to adjust it without proceeding to a more invasive procedure. We ended up doing a re-filling on it (which was completely fine with me, I just wanted it to be fixed as best as possible). Although that tooth has its days of sensitivity ..it is a HUGE win for me because I can chew, and I'm not in pain & I am confident that I received the best care. I look forward to having their team be my go to for my dental needs & have now started Invisalign with them. Appreciate the high level of service and quality of care that Dr. Nanjapa and his team provides.  This is a great place to go to for your dental care!< /text>

< Review>
I hadn’t been to the dentist in an embarrassingly long time, and needed several things done to my teeth. They were able to accommodate all of my needs in one visit and my doctor was very informative throughout every step of the process. I discovered them on google, and was very satisfied with every aspect of my visit, from the check-in to check-our. I would highly recommend to anyone in search of a new dentist, or looking to transfer!</Review>

I have been coming here for the past 5 years and this Dentist office by FAR is the best. Priscilla is very friendly and professional and is always a huge help when we need help last minute. The office is very flexible and the doctors are great. My old dentist was very rough and I dreaded going for even a simple cleaning. I have had alot of work done at Deccan and never felt pain and really don't mind going to the dentist anymore. I highly recommend coming to this office.<//review>

<Text>Office is decorated beautiful and is very clean.
Personnel in front and back treat you very well and the doctors are kind and professional. The treatment I received was excellent and prices charged were below previous offices I have been to. You won't regret going to this state of the art office, with new equipment to complete my treatment with knowledgeable dental staff. I give it 5 stars! Thanks Deccan Dental<//Text>< Pictures>

We are very happy with Deccan Dental! My daughter has had cleanings there, and I have had cleanings/fillings done, and each experience has been extremely positive. Dr. Nanjapa is thorough, professional, and caring, and his staff is excellent. The office is clean and comfortable and even relaxing. We do not have insurance, and I find the prices to be very fair and reasonable, and have never felt that any services were pushed on me. I would recommend them to anyone.<//review>

Dr. Nanjapa is great. I called the day before because the other dentist canceled on me. It was important because it had to be coordinated with my ortho appt. I explained the situation to Dr. Nanajapa and he I kindly fit me in the following day.

The office is in a great location in SM and nice modern building. Dr. Nanjapa cleaned my teeth and I am very happy with it.< /Review>

My mother-in-law has been going to this dental office for the last couple of years. I did my research and found this to be the best office for her needs and she was not disappointed. They always treat her in a friendly and professional manner and the care she receives is always thorough. We are sad that the office will no longer be in the DeltaCare network. Thank you all for giving Virginia the best dental care.</text>

We've been patients of Deccan Dental for 3 years and have been totally satisfied with the care and treatment that we've received.  Unfortunately, our insurance is no longer one that the practice accepts so we are looking for a new dentist. We doubt that we will find one that is as good as Deccan, so we may decide to go private pay and receive the excellent care we've been receiving. An excellent place for dental care.<//review>

Best dental office in the Bay Area. I have chosen to bring them my business for years for my dental needs. Whether Dr. Nanjapa, Dr. Pinal, or one of their dental assistants is performing your procedure/cleaning you can rest assured you're in great skilled hands and all for a fair price.

Don't hesitate to give them a try. I'm amazed at how skilled they are at what they do. Procedures that should cause discomfort they are able to perform 99% discomfort free, I've almost fell asleep during procedures there. Their hand movement, dexterity, and attention to detail during a procedure is amazing. If you are ever in discomfort or pain they are quick to respond to your needs immediately, and they always take proper precautions prior to any procedures. If you want a dentist you look forward to visiting because they care about you as an individual, you should consider the office of Deccan Dental.<//review>

I switched to them after a bad experience with another dentist and I'm so happy I did. The last dentist told me I needed four root canals. At Deccan, they were actually honest. It turns out I didn't need any. I only had one tooth that had the potential for needing one due to an old filling that was large. Luckily, Dr. Nanjapa was able to replace the filling using an inlay, which is kind of like a mini crown. It was a much cheaper and better alternative because they didn't have to shave down my tooth, especially since most of it was intact even though the filling was large. I was really happy with this alternative and I'm really happy with Dr. Nanjapa and Deccan Dental!< /review>< Pictures>

Great office, clean well taken care of. Staff is kind to you from the minute you walk in. Both Dr. Pinal and Dr. Nanjapa are great they really seem to take their time with you and answer all questions needed. The office also has a hygentist and their Dental assistant Brianna is more than helpful and makes you feel at home.< /review>

<text>Dr. Nanjapa is very professional. He is polite, considerate, transparent and inclusive. The dental assistants and the receptionist were also very polite and professional. If I could rate 6 stars I would. I have been continually going to the office for about 12+ visits over the last few years and every time I have actually looked forward to the visit. The doctors and assistants at Deccan Dental are some of the best I have ever encountered.

Choosing a new dentist can be a difficult decision, there is a lot of competition out there, but you want to find someone whom you can trust. I highly recommend visiting Deccan Dental and Dr. Nanjapa and developing your own opinion.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I go to Dr. Pinal. She is very efficient and professional. Dr. Pinal has helped me with regular cleaning and fillings including a very tough one on side of second molar. And recommended me to a very good doctor for wisdom tooth extraction. Highly recommended.</review>

<review>Have you ever said, “I can’t wait to get my fillings done!” and meant it? After the treatment I have received by Dr. Pinal and the entire Deccan Dental Staff, I can’t wait for my next appointment!
I use to be prone to heightened anxiety when visiting a Dentist. I shared this with Dr. Pinal, and she has made me feel so at ease, I now welcome the opportunity to see her.
Dr. Pinal is also a magician! She gave me back my smile that over the years had been damaged for a variety of reasons, many out of my control.
I highly recommend Deccan Dental. They simply make things (not just teeth), better!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I love the Dentist here. They all have great bedside manners and they are very through. I have searched high and low for a good dentist since my dentist of 20 years retired. I think I made a good choice when I added them as part of my care team. As a public health professional, I am very particular in the selection  of whom I allow to work on me and  Dr.Samir Nanjapa, DDS MS has stood the test of time. He is smart, honest and knowledgable in denistry and that works for me .</Text>

I waited 45 minutes for them to help 2 customers then they told me they didn’t have the phone I wanted. Didn’t even try to tell me where I could go in town to find the phone I need. They were rude and unhelpful. Worst T Mobile service I have have ever had. Slowest location I have ever been. Neither employee was wearing a name badge I will be reporting to T Mobile directly as well. Don’t bother going here it’s a waste of time. They should close this location as well.</Review>

Mt. Vernon location is far better than the Columbus location. Marco and Sergio helped me out rather than accuse me of breaking my phone like the worthless employees at the Columbus location. I will continue to bring all of my future business to the Mt. Vernon location. I suggest everyone keep driving past the Columbus location and don't look back.< /review>

Not helpful at all. They did nothing but look at you like you are stupid. They are just ready to go home. I felt like it was lady we are ready to go home. For people who have been with the company and just now wanting to upgrade we should not be charged an arm and a leg. What makes things worse is that when you the store they dismiss you with a sad sounding sorry. One star for this Sprint store. I wish that I could have given them 0 stars. Maybe being a loyal customer don't mean anything anyway< /Text>

<Text>Yesterday I went in and activated a phone (paid off) and one of the sales reps charged me to activate it! I called customer service and the said sprint stores are not supposed to charge because you get your activation charge on your bill! This guy charged me $42 and said he was giving me a free glass protector..LIES! I went back to the store while a coorprate rep was on the line. I asked for my receipt and the sales man said he didn't have a receipt because his system worked different. I paid about $78 just to get service plus my monthly bill. I got ripped off and I hope no one else does. [Tall slim male.]</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I went a few weeks ago to order my new IPhone 7 plus and I was approached by the Manager Vanessa. She was extremely honest and forward with me on getting the iphone she told me my phone was going to arrive the 12 of October but I got it sonner the 5 of this month. I was extreamly Happy with the service I got from her and the rest of the staff. I was so happy with how everything went so fast that I also got my mother to switch from Metro to Sprint. Once again I went back later that day to get my moms phone and she gave me the best deal she took her time programming both my phones. I extreamly recommend people to come to the store. Vanessa and her team are so great and give the best customer service. Thank you Vanessa and all of your staff ;) (My Heroe)

<text>Sprint will encourage you to make an appointment (thats what I did) to visit their store. But when you show up if there is a walk in customer before you, Sprint will not honor your appointment(company policy). If you decide you want to wait, keep in mind there are no chairs and you will have to stand. Making an appointment seems like a good way to manage employee scheduling and handle customer demand but it just for show. By the way don't get the FAMILY LOCATOR SERVICE,($5.99 a month) with full bars and my son sitting in the room with me the closest it got was 1.1 miles. This has happened multiply times recently, three months ago service was much better, also service has gotten worst (no signal and dropped calls, Sprint unable to give me an answer as to why. My sons phone USB port got damaged, so we drove 10 miles to the nearest repair center , where we were told after 5 seconds of inspection that this was a TotalEquipmentProtection insurance claim and I should call insurance company. Called insurance company and they said take it to repair center. Was there anyone surprised?</text>< pics>

Stay away from franchise stores like this one. Every sale or service needs to be called into Sprint corporate.</Review>

very professional & timely service.
they had to replace 2 panels in the front of the car but worked on all adjacent panels to ensure proper color match. and when i picked up the car, they even polished out some swirl marks in the back that I had created earlier.
very satisfied and would definitely recommend!<//review>< Pictures>

Excellent work. Had a confrontation with a concrete column in a parking garage. I lost. Chilton made the whole process painless. Enterprise  delivered a car to Chilton and I dropped it off with them. Car looks new again.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I cannot say enough about the concierge-level service at CARSTAR Chilton Auto Body in San Carlos.  The front hood of my brand new Tesla Model 3 was badly damaged in the recent wind storms in the Bay Area when the basketball hoop on our driveway fell onto the vehicle.  CARSTAR was friendly and efficient about arranging for a rental car, the repairs, and keeping me updated on the progress.  My car was finished ahead of schedule and looks brand new.  And they took care of the return of the rental car for me.  The process of picking up my car and returning my rental car took no more than 10 minutes.  I highly recommend this business.< /review>< pictures>

Was recommended here by Geico as Chilton's was an experienced Tesla repair shop.  I had a parking lot incident where the other vehicle decided to drive too close to my stationary Model 3 and took out my front bumper cover and one headlight.

By the next day Chiltons had my car in the shop, with a 1 week estimate to repair (and a loaner provided by Geico).  There was a few days delay due to shipment of the replacement bumper from Tesla, but Chilton's kept me updated via texts on an almost daily basis.

Picked up the car, and the bumper/headlight look brand new.</Text>

Really great experience. Received a reasonable quote on damage to my Model X very quickly. Was given continual updates on progress. Work done timely. Slightly below quote. Car looks good as new. Perfect paint match etc. I really appreciate that Ken made a special trip to the shop on Saturday for me to pickup car.<//Review>

<Review>Auto collision damage for Tesla Model X. They towed car from my home and dropped off at my home when completed. Car looks great but will need to drive and utilize functions to determine if everything works in the upcoming weeks. One function concerning Sentry mode isn’t working properly but it may be a Tesla software issue. But since Chilton offers a lifetime warranty, I feel
confident they’ll fix any issue that may arise.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

This is the fourth time I have used Chilton for body work on a car and I have been extremely happy each time,  They took care of the repair work and completed it when they said it would be done.  They washed the car better than a car wash would, and even cleaned the floor mats.  Everything from the initial inspection to the paperwork to the sanitariness
of all that I had to touch was arranged with the customer's health in mind.
They are a company that has been in business a long time and I can tell they will continue to be.< /Review>

<Text>Great experience with Chilton! It is that magic Ctrl+Z button in real life, for when you do something not very smart... It took less than a week to get the genuine Nissan bumper, paint it with exact match of color / pearl white metallic texture / clear coat, fit it precisely and make car available for pickup after my normal work hours. I found my car to have steering wheel and driver floor mat covered, and to my amazement - not a single change to driver's seat position, I usually have to readjust this every third car wash. Because car came sparkling clean (kudos !) and with new bumper - I found out that the headlights have seen some wear and tear over the years, but Chilton got me covered right away.
I am back into my drivers seat like nothing ever happened, thank you for great , quick and seamless experience !

<response>None< /response><Review>Chilton returned my car better than when it came from the factory. I initially brought in my Model 3 for front bumper+fender body work after someone hit it and ran while parked. When I brought it in, I mentioned there was a slight defect with the rear liftgate that had been there since it came from the factory, causing the left side of the trunk to slightly protrude. It was a minor cosmetic defect but it bothered me enough I had tried to fix it myself numerous times to no avail. When I picked the car up three days later, they had flawlessly repaired the front bumper, fixed the liftgate free of charge, and detailed the car to a standard that was probably worth more than my insurance deductible. Highly recommend getting in a fender bender so you can utilize their services.<//Review><time>1607372269128< /time><Gmap_id>0x808f9f5357eef889:0x3f95eaf87528f918<//Gmap_id>< rate>

The only place to have body work done for Tesla!   Tesla approved and technicians did a beautiful job replacing a quarter panel, which requires taking apart the entire back portion of the car and putting it all back together.  Cost the same as another quote that was only going to repair the damages.  Johnny is amazing, so patient with the many questions, knew exactly what needed to be done and alway responds quickly.  Katie and the rest of staff are all so profession and friendly.  They truly care about your car and make it new again.  They all go the extra mile to make sure you are taken care of.  They help with rental car if needed and is a Geico Auto Repair Xpress faculty, so you can book online through Geico and all the information forwards to them automatically.  Do not take Tesla any where else.</review>

My car has been stayed here longer than 5 month and no updated from them. According to the record all the parts has arrived one month ago, but then no more updated from them and never reply my email. I highly double that they took my car for private business.< /Text>

After a very minor accident, my wife brought her car to this shop based on Geico's recommendation and it's proximity to our home... And I'm so glad we did!

Crazy efficient process. Geico claims guy was there, rental car was there, shop manager inspected the car in no time. We we're off in a new set of wheels in around 15 minutes.

Repair time was about a week, which we did get slightly impatient about but quality work takes time... And yes, it was worth it.

Picking up the car was as seamless as dropping it off. Bill had already been covered by insurance, rental car went back to it's home, and we were on our way. Upon closer inspection the car was better than it was prior to the accident. Had a couple spots polished that weren't part of the damage, they replaced a headlight free of charge, and whatever they used to clean the plastic trim on the car makes this thing look like a million bucks

After this experience, I'd recommend anyone to get into a fender bender just so they have a good excuse to visit this shop. I'm kidding, don't wreck your car on purpose... But if you want to freshen up a car then visit some of the friendliest automotive folks in town at Chilton<//review>

Horrible Geico inspection center! On ad says 15 minutes but I was over there more than 3 house. Adjuster CHASE PATTERSON was very rude and mean to me. He asked me personal questions! He is very tricky and liar! He was very unprofessional. He made uncomfortable and posed off! CHASE PATTERSON is the most disgusting and rude Geico staff I have ever seen! Remember this name and never go to that terrible busy shop if you want not to be taken care of! If I were at Geico executive office I would fire him. I canceled my policy and business with Geico after many years loyalty due to this jackass!< /Review>

<Text>Poor workmanship and even worse customer service.
They installed the wrong bumper on my truck and tried to pass it off as if it were the right one, even though it didn't fit and there was a big gap in the joints.
They eventually owned up and got the right part, which took another week.
Then when I finally get my truck back all the wiring to the camper shell was hanging lose and my locks weren't working.
Now they are trying to insinuate that they never worked and are trying to avoid finishing/fixing their repair work.
Won't use them again, there are plenty of other body shops around to choose from that won't make you go back 6 times and still not have the work finished.</Text><gmapID>0x808f9f5357eef889:0x3f95eaf87528f918</gmapID>< user>

Horrible service. After visiting on Sept 11th and promised to be given a call in next 24 hours for scheduling appointment to bring my car and then getting estimate email on Sept13th , I was waiting for call till now, Sept 19th. When I called they couldn't find my information there. I explained  when I was at the shop and that I've got an estimating email.The woman on the phone put me on hold without warning and 3min later said they will send me estimate. My respond was I already have an estimate,  I want my car be repaired. She replied she doesn't have me in her computer. When I asked her if it is my fault,  she yeld at me an hang up. Next person pick up phone named himself Alex, didn't give me a chance to start talking and raised his voice to me...Most horrible services ever. If they can  afford communicate this way to customers ...its not a business that should be there..</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I love this place, food is so fresh and tasty. The staff do a wonderful job keeping the service going and the kitchen clean while they are on the food line prepping food. It's kinda cool that you can see your food being prepared while you wait too. I believe in constructive criticism and so the only thing I can fault is once I ordered a salad to go and they forgot my dressing on the side and the tortilla chips are slightly over salted...big whoop! This place is awesome!! Hats off to the manager!!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

This location needs some serious help. I was a teenager when we got in line and collecting social security by the time we left. We waited over 30 minutes for our food. The staff was doing their best but were either not trained or there were not enough of them. One star is for getting the order correct and offering abundant chips while we waited. Management step in!</Text>

If I'm craving fish tacos; this place is a solid choice. I like the Fish Taco Especial with no red sauce. Beans and rice are solid. I've been in this restaurant many times and the service is always friendly and fast plus they keep the place clean.< /Text>

Surprisingly good food!  I had the Balsamic and Roasted Veggie Salad with chicken.  Very tasty.  Next time I'll ask for the dressing on the side.  And the young man behind the counter was courteous, helpful and provided great service. I don't write reviews, but this deserved a thank you.<//Review>

Always fresh ingredients. Always great service with a smile. When you leave they wave goodbye.
Salsa Verde Shrimp tacos plate is a reason to live. I love this place. I've eaten in six or so different locations and it's always the same high quality. Amazing.</text>

Food was good as expected. Service from the cashiers was terrible, they seemed so bothered and weren’t even in uniform. I caught their names but I won’t use them here I’m just going to say they need to find other jobs if they’re so miserable here.</text>

But most of the time I do have to call to place my order and today I called for fifteen minutes straight and no answer. It's very frustrating when you have your mind set on something and they are not available to accommodate a phone order for me or others calling in.< /review><response>None</response>< user_id>

<Review>Small burrito.  Ordered a langostino burrito and was mostly tortilla with very little filling.  It was tasty for the small bit that was in there.  The side chips it was served with were a bit stale.  Not worth the the price.  Would recommend Sharkys or Chipotle over this place.< /Review>< pictures>

Great service, kid at the front desk was very patient and polite, his name was Brandon I think, and one of the cooks, Cade, took extra care to make sure everything was exactly the way I wanted it. Great crew</Review>

Rubios is always a place that you are guaranteed GOOD food. One of my favorite places to eat regardless of the town/city we are visiting. Stopped here on our way home from Cambria.</review>

<text>Our second bad experience at the newbury park location in 2 months. The young men that work in the kitchen just dont care about customer service or the food they serve. I ordered a side of rice and steak for my young children, the steak was only half a serving and was mixed with chicken. When u asked about the steak they replied "well thats all that is left" then they went and cooked a new order. The rice looked fine, but when i got home and opened it it was all hard and not edible. All in all i was in the store for about 25min for a takeout order, and the place was not busy.</text>< pictures>

< review>
After qualifying for CIF in the Marmonte League Cross Country Championships, I ate at the Rubios in Newbury Park. I had 1 fish taco and a shrimp burrito at 7PM. Got food poisoning and was vomiting from 3AM on. Missed school the next day and had stomach cramping and dry heaves all morning.</review>

You gotta love a place that specializes in fish tacos. There aren't Rubios in Washington, so when I'm vacationing in California I make sure to drop in at least once.<//Text>

Pretty neat place. Bought a couple firearms here. Phil was my favorite employee there. Aside from the million pages of paperwork we had to do...I was very happy with my purchases. He no longer works here tho darn it. But the stuff here is pretty neat.< /text>

<text>So glad we ended up stopping in on a whim tonight! Literally every employee was super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Not once did anyone have that "gun store" attitude that you'll find at other Sacramento outdoor/gun stores. This place has great stock, is well-organized and very clean. Phil, the assistant manager, was so pleasant to deal with and felt like chatting with an old friend. Rico was also great and professional during our transaction. Not only are the prices here better than any store in the area, but the customer service makes you glad to give your business. Left here with a handshake and a smile, as I wish more companies would do! Happy to have made a big purchase here, look forward to making many more, of all sizes, for many years to come!< /text><resp>None<//resp><user>105672709365552556865</user><GmapID>0x809b2118563b85cb:0x937571ac64fe4d16< /GmapID></record>

<text>Great team here. Wife and I went in to find  a firearm she can handle, and ended up with some great coaching that helped her better handle what we already have. Even if what you want isn't currently available, the crew will work with you to make payments towards it, so when it is available it will be yours. This is so much better than hearing "we don't have it and don't know when it will be available, good luck."</text>< user_name>

They carry some firearm accessories and other miscellaneous outdoor gear for hunting, but not much for fishing.</review><gmapID>0x809b2118563b85cb:0x937571ac64fe4d16< /gmapID>< rating>

So glad we ended up stopping in on a whim tonight! Literally every employee was super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Not once did anyone have that "gun store" attitude that you'll find at other Sacramento outdoor/gun stores. This place has great stock, is well-organized and very clean. Phil, the assistant manager, was so pleasant to deal with and felt like chatting with an old friend. Rico was also great and professional during our transaction. Not only are the prices here better than any store in the area, but the customer service makes you glad to give your business. Left here with a handshake and a smile, as I wish more companies would do! Happy to have made a big purchase here, look forward to making many more, of all sizes, for many years to come!< /text>

<text>I arrived for a PPT (private party transaction) of an off roster rare handgun and was impressed by the knowledgeable and helpful staff.  Since I was two hours away, a customer focused member of the staff called me when my DROS (Dealer Record of Sale) cleared, so that I could use my time efficiently.  I picked up my new handgun today and bought the last of the 9mm Luger ammo and some M-Pro 7 cleaner.  Highly recommended.  Also, surprisingly, no wait during the pandemic.  Some FFLs are reluctant to perform PPTs during the pandemic, but Turners was happy to accommodate me.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Went in on 10-18-2019 to get an Item on sale. I called ahead to confirm that it was in stock first and when I got there it was. When I came in I was pleasantly greeted by a man named Phil. Phil was professional, knowledgeable, and pleasant the entire process. I was in and out in less than 20 mins.

Thanks Phil and the Turner’s team!< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp><rate>5< /rate><UserId.>104646887766982929266< /UserId.><time>1571454101833< /time><user_name>Jordon B<//user_name><gmapID>0x809b2118563b85cb:0x937571ac64fe4d16< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Came here after going to Ammo Depot.  The people at Ammo Depot had a bad attitude and weren't super helpful.

Kelsey, the manager, was super friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  This customer service earned the store a pistol sale and new customer.< /Review>

Stores and restaurants are fine. But..
My husband, our dog and I walked around the buildings today. The field/open area had (what I counted) 63 empty liquor bottles.  The little airplane size and pint size all over.  Broken glass everywhere. We could not walk our dog on the dirt paths.  Idk who should be taking care of this but we all pay monthly HOA fee to live in the area.  :-/</Text>

You pay a premium price for things bit better than running into town.  Staff is helpful and management gives back to the community.<//Review>

<review>Great liquor store. Almost has everything I need every time I go in. Snacks, drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic. They have specialty items such as a few random fruits and veggies as well as dips i.e. hummus, spinach dip and a few others. Definitely glad they do a good job because that's all you got when in the estate's.<//review>< Response>

< review>
The Mexican restaurant always gives me some weird avocado diluted stuff, even when I ask for avocado slices. The pizza next door is expensive. It is amazing though...just too expensive.< /review>

A convenience store, Mexican food, Italian food all have great tasting food. Serving the Estates, it is the only close shopping center for 5 miles.<//text>

<review>Works to fast. Does not take time and messed up the line up. In less then 6 min of a haircut for 20 dollars it is not fair. They should take there time. They don't care.

<review>The professionals here are extremely knowledgeable, and know their products and styles extremely well. I went in for a haircut, but wasn't sure what to get. When the cosmetologist suggested different types of cut and styles that fit my typed hair, I had a better idea of what I could get done. It came out amazing. They also offer military and student discounts as well. I was inane out in less than 30 minutes. I'll definitely be returning in the future.<//review>< pictures>

I went today Tuesday 8, around 5pm to their place on Prosperity/Tulare. The lady that did my hair was nice, but she really didn't know what to do with my hair, I asked her for a book and I showed her what I want, but anyway she did a bad job on my hair, she discounted $2.50 because I wasn't happy with my hair cut. Now, I have to spend much more money in fixing my hair. Very UNHAPPY!! I DON'T recommend the place! NO!</review>

Clean facility, staff can be friendly at times, always in a hurry. Haircuts can be so-so, depending on who you get to cut your hair.</text>

<Text>DARLENE at this facility can NOT cut hair.

I went to a lady by the name of Sam here one time, GREAT service .

Darlene charged me for a line up and didn’t line me up at all . Actually messed up my line up lol
And that was THE most rushed haircut I’ve ever had in my life. I was in and out of her chair within 5 minutes.
Terrible service.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80952b8bab19299f:0xb9f0db2010d734a1<//gmapID></record>

O my god                  I said no never mind just line me up she had my hairline look like a math equation from high school geometry textbook and will never be going back there again</Text>

The girl thinned her hair without asking and cut huge chunks out of the top of her hair so there are random 2" sections of her hair that are 6" shorter than the rest!!! My daughter is a 13 year old girl who is now crying in her room, dreading going to school tomorrow. I am absolutely disgusted by the job this girl did. I could have done a better job!!!! My heart is broken for my poor daughter! I don't know the girls name or I would put her on blast. Ridiculous!!!</Text>< Pictures>

Horrible experience. From the beginning the girl who checked us in was giving me attitude maybe because she had to cut my baby's hair and. It took her 5 minutes and she didn't even try after she said she was done. Now I have to take my baby somewhere else to get his hair fixed.< /Text>

I took my 11 yr old daughter here for a trim, Ashley is the horrible lady that cut her hair and it was a horrible job, she cut her hair in 4-5 minutes and my daughter is so upset, Ashely shouldn't be touching anyone's hair!!!!!!! I didn't notice it until the next morning when she wore her hair down ... I will never go here again...!!!!!!<//review>

Fantastic chicken, but don't underestimate the carne asada it's very good and worth the combination plate. Not to mention tortilla, chips from scratch</text>

First time here today. The chicken is very very delicious too bad I live so far away I was in the neighborhood for personal reasons I'm from East LA but wouldn't mind taking the drive to this place again one day. Customer service was great. Absolutely 💯< /Review>

It's known for their Trip Tip burritos but they got other food food items as well. It's not exactly authentic Mexican Food but better than going to El Pollo Loco. They adapted their food for the general area in Simi Valley, which isn't a bad thing. Fast service and food customer experience.< /text>

I have been going to Pollo Corona for a while. Everytime I have gone it's been nothing but delicious.

The staff there are fast and friendly. They have not ever gotten my order wrong; even phone orders!<//Review>

<Text>Best Mexican food in Simi Valley! It’s always packed but there’s never a long wait. They have Tri Tip, Chicken, veggies plates or you can get any of those options in one of the best burritos around. If you haven’t tried it you won’t be disappointed!< /Text>< pics>

<text>Glorious! The tri tip is to die for. The owner always greets me with Hello amigo every time I stop there. They catered my birthday party once and my family raved about the food. It does not get any better.<//text></record>

<Review>This place is the best. It's hard to find authentic Mexican food in Simi Valley but here it is. The tri-tip is to die for! The burrito is good like a carne asada burrito but lately the sauce has been spicy so watch out! Also great homemade salsa. Good selection of Mexican bottled drinks as well as Fountain drinks. I love the spanish music, it's just like being at my Grandma's house. It doesn't get more authentic than this. I like the decor it's kind of Southwestern. Check it out you won't be disappointed.<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< GmapID>

The burrito was different, but in a good way. They have a very small menu. It's basically a couple of barbecue plates or burritos. I'd eat there again. The salsa was very good.</review>

This is the spot for tri tip. I always do the 8pc tri tip with a side of rice and flour tortillas. I make tacos that are incredible. The salsa is delicious as well.</review>

(Translated by Google) Very rich everything but unfortunately the cashier leaves a lot to be desired with the customer service, it requires more education. Prices are also not in sight.

Muy rico todo pero lastimosamente la cajera deja mucho que desear con la atención del cliente, requiere de más educación. Los precios tampoco están a la vista.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very well the food is excellent, super good, I recommend it, just one detail the cashier sees that she is a little impatient to serve customers, she should have a little more patience since sometimes she does not know what to choose one. But from there excellent work.

(Original)
Muy bien la comida es excelente super buena la recomiendo, solo un detalle la cajera se ve que es un poco impaciente para atender alos clientes deberia tener un poquito mas de paciencia ya que aveses no sabe que elegir uno. Pero de ahi excelente trabajo.</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Chingon as always, pretend that you made roast meat in your house, but only that here you did not cook or have to clean anything. Also that seasoning is difficult to match. Good!
