Met both young& professional ladies that run the office and everything went smooth. Dropped off car, picked up in 4 days & wow! Was a smooth operation as never before! What's convenient is they have a car rental as well, lobby to wait of necessary& clean public restroom!  No hassles, no fooling around, nothing to complain 😉 all positive & great communication from beginning to end!</review>

<Text>The final job was ok with some details. The new windshield had a couple of scratches which tells me that the place is not detailed oriented. My side mirror was covered with black glue that I have to clean with a special cleaner.

However I can pass that.

The situation that made me unhappy is that my car was ready on Friday and I was not able to pick it up as I was working. I told customer service that I will do it on Saturday. They told me that they will be open until noon. So I went on Saturday and the body shop was closed. I lost half of my day and I had to rent a new car as I dropped the previous one in the rental car place.

On Monday I didn’t even receive an apology for the mistake. Obviously they don’t really care about good costumer service.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1619887745670, 'text': 'Manuel, we’re very sorry to hear the customer service from our team was lacking during your experience and appreciate you taking the time to share this with us.

My 2016 Honda Accord was in this shop for a week for a collision repair.I dropped it off last week after I talked to my insurance and referred me to this place. To make the story short my insurance told me to look for Luis Guzman. He is the one that handled my claim and repair for my vehicle. I'm happy the way he handled the process of repairing my car from the  beginning until the end of the process. Thanks Luis.<//Text>

I took my truck in 4 times because they couldn't fix it write so I spoke to Erica she was in charge of handling my truck repairs so i took it in ones and all they did was wash it!!!!! For what i can afford a car wash the second time  the same my back driver  door was not aligned with the other door and the body so again all they did wash it for me and it took the 3 days!!! Why not sure so finally i took it in again and i had to be specific of what was wrong with my door after i had told them the other 2 times they where too lazy too take of the rubber door stoppers they painted write over them so i told them i wanted that fix water was going i to my cab thru the door the paint didn't match you could still see spots of primer so they tried to buff it out it did not work  so she said to me all call you Monday too set an appointment to drop it off 2 weeks later no phone call  yet so i decided to call her  and she said o i was just going to call you to set a day to drop it of and set you up with a rental  witch she never did so i drop of my truck i never did see her so i called her to ask her about the rental and she send me straight to voicemail so I left her 2 messages and never did call me back I was with out a car for 1 week so i had to miss work and one night they left my truck door open. How do i know that i have a owlcam on my truck it does live streaming and alerts  so i was looking at everything they where doing to my truck very bad service don't recommend this service king and special Erica she's terrible i would no recommend this place go to any other service king beside dis one save the stress and headache.<//Review>

<Text>Great repair work and Nice paint of rear bumper. My car is very old. The model was stopped production more than a decade ago. So it was difficult to find the repair parts but they did in reasonable amount of time.
They also cleaned my car. My car’s head light shield was foggy because it was old. But they cleaned and polished by some way. I originally thought they replaced the plastic part but I found it was original. Amazing job.</Text><name>Masaki Kohno< /name><gmap_id>0x808fcb89b320db45:0x2221cacd04868c61<//gmap_id>< Date>

The driver side door was giving me some troubles. Based on my past excellent experience, I decided to take my car to Car West. This time I took it to their newly opened San Jose location. I was greeted with courtesy and respect. The issue was taken care of in a timely manner and the work was completed withing the projected time. I was once again overjoyed with excellent and timely service. I would recommend the knowledgeable staff of this location to anyone, anytime.</review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>I have gone to this service king twice before. I gave them two stars because they do an excellent job on the car. However, their customer service has always been a problem. Despite having an appointment, they delayed me for an hour while going over the car, filling out paperwork, and finding the necessary people to sign off on it. I need to get to work and don't have time to sit in the waiting room.

The last time I came in, it took 2 weeks to get the appointment. Then I showed up and they told me I was "late" (they never in fact gave me a time to show up), but could fit me in. Then they told me they needed a guy who was not there to sign off on the paperwork (after waiting 1/2 hour). Can I leave the car? No, you need to make another appointment. Result, nothing accomplished, waited two weeks, have to start over again.

I am indeed starting again, but with another shop this time.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>As a State Farm agent it is very important for me to get my customer's vehicles repaired with the least amount of inconvenience as possible.

Getting into an automobile accident is never fun and having professional people like those employed at Car West Auto Body makes it a seamless transaction from accident to getting the vehicle back on the road.

Sarah, the marketing representative, has been great at making sure that I receive the most up-to-date information on the company as well as checking back with me when vehicles are submitted through the agent portal to make sure that our mutual Guests have received the best experience possible.

If you are an agent get with Sarah, she will get things going for you.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>After being experiencing a hit and run in the rear end of the car.  I was referred to Car West to repair the damages to my car.  The service I received was superb - from the moment I stepped in, to the moment my car was finished.  Dimarco Rivas did a really exceptional job at communicating the damages to my car, providing me with an estimate, updating me on the ETA, and working with my insurance agent.  A car rental was also provided until the repairs were done.  The process was so easy/painless.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience and would definitely return in the future.< /Review><Response>None</Response><name>Kalvin Tran<//name><Gmap_id>0x808fcb89b320db45:0x2221cacd04868c61< /Gmap_id>< pics>

Brought my car in to get my front end repaired on my Scion. The work was done very well. The repairs almost appear seamless. The paint work is spot on for a rare factory color my car came in. I really admire the work. For the next few weeks upon picking up my car I noticed some horrible repairs under the surfaces. Unnecessary screws holding panels where screws never were from the factory; just to keep things together. Really choppy/lazy approach to quick repairs. What gets me most about my experience with this shop is from the beginning of the whole process. The first day when I brought in my car, with an appointment and all, the service adviser that will be taking care of my car wasn't even there. Though the whole process of my car being in this shop I've been passed from advisor to another advisor. A total of four advisors and none have ever updated me on the status of my vehicle. I work for Honda so I know how most service centers work but this shop is just absurd when it comes to customer notifications. The worst part of the whole service is my GoPro that I use as a dash cam was TAKEN/STOLEN. I know it was taken because I stash the camera under my drivers seat out of sight and in a compartment which holds a vehicle lift/jack set. it doesn't stop there. The I mentioned the problem with the last service advisor who helped me and he told me to send an invoice. I've sent countless emails and called so many times I lost count. NO REPLY AT ALL. (Even emailed corporate with no response.)
It's just a shame since the Honda I work for we refer our customers to numerous Service Kings in the South Bay. Obviously I will no longer refer our customers to this location. (Should have known the reputation CARWEST had in the past before it became Service King.)
I was initially going to rate this service center 3 stars because I love the work that was done but upon writing this review I was just reminded of all the problems I've been though and my Stolen Camera.

If you ever decide to do business with this shop. Be very Cautious. Good Luck.<//Review>

<Text>Our office has a great relationship with Carwest because of Sarah Heinz always keeping us  updated about the great services & amenities that Carwest offers our clients. Many of my clients tell me that they feel like a King/Queen from the moment they file their claim to the moment they pick up their car from Carwest. One client said she had been with 21st Century for over 10 yrs and never experienced the RED CARPET treatment.. We refer my clients to Carwest because they value our clients and deliver what they promise. Sarah Heinz is a Asset to this company and we are lucky to have her as my Rep.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
Walked in today (07/30/20) to buy a sub. The older lady that took my order did not look like she wanted to take my order. Her customer service skills are practically non-existent. I would have loved it if instead she had told me she did not want to take my order because she was in a bad mood and I would have gladly gone elsewhere without having to leave this review. I can see why this place is so empty compared to the other Subways I have visited. I will avoid this location at all costs. What a shame.< /review>

When I ordered the Ruben and was asked which bread...I requested the obvious_ rye bread.  They were out. Then the clerk also said they were out of sauerkraut. Ok, I guess a Ruben was out of the question. My coworker asked for extra tomatoes, oil, and vinegar on his sandwich and the service lacked there also.<//Text>< pictures>

I go here almost every friday for the Tuna deal they have. Its the closest from my work and easy to deal with since you can order through the app. Most times ive picked up through the app there were things off about the sandwich (ill get extra ingredients or things are missing, the directions werent followed as closely etc). Today, Jasmine did my order, and it was a great sandwich. Her attention to detail was on spot and she even wrapped my sandwich twice without requesting (never even thought of that. I always have a problem with the juices leaking over time). In general this place is pretty good and their indoor facility is clean and usually quick when they are a little busy. I dont expect perfection with the app orders most times anyway but Jasmine really went above and beyond today.<//text>

This place is nice. Prices are super cheap / reasonable for what I'm buying at least. Dude behind the counter keeps it cool and friendly. I go back because dude is cool and prices are cool. Top notch smoke shop< /Review>

The employee I talked to was super friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. He even helped me set up my vape without me needing to ask, and was eager to go above and beyond for me as a person and a member of the military.<//text>

I walked in not knowing what to expect since the location was convenient to where I was at. I had broken the glass on my vape and needed a replacement. Not only did Frank have what I needed, he promised to order in whatever juice was my favorite and keep it in stock for me next time I came back. Literally one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had. Love this place!</text>

This smoke shop is the best smoke shop in town! Prices and product quality are exceptional! And on top of that, frank will take the time to show you all of his selections and help you choose the right one AND show you how to properly use it. This will definitely be my number 1 go to smoke shop.<//Text>

My husband and i have been customers here since big daddys opened and recently i have noticed that there is one female employee that has been there for the last year i believe her name is Nichole and is always so very helpful and is always multi managing each and every customer and she is always knowledgeable and takes the time to really resolve whatever problems we or other customers may have .. I do seem to think that the manager is not as friendly and have seen her criticize and correct her in front of customers . My heart felt for her because for all the work she does i think she should be the one to go to whenever you need help with any garden issues . love the selection and would like to see more employees that are as eager as her to help!!< /text>

Agree that the Spanish cashier doesn't seem to want to help. You ask him a question and he comes off as "I don't know, I don't really care". The prices are great but service could be better.< /text>

I ditched all other stores for this, on $500 to $1000 purchases I get an additional 10% to 15% off and that's even after being lower then the other stores!  The young women there are fast and friendly and know the products.  The two guys there both smart and friendly and well schooled at growing.</Text>

Bad customer service! Spanish cashier guy doesnt really seems like he want to help customers. For example, you ask a question, he answers and walk away! We shoppers go there to support their business but if they have employees like this? They are going to lose business!< /Text>

< Review>
Stopped by to pic up some food for the office. Didn’t realize you couldn’t order three online deals in store but they staff still helped me get a large enough order together. Everything was really good. Loved the rice and beans. The carnitas were fantastic. Really loved it.< /Review>

If you want true Carnitas from Michoacán this is the right place to go. The flavor is very similar with las carnitas de Michoacán.</text>

<Text>The place is horrible. Dry carnitas, microwaved tortillas, and salsas were terrible. It’s the first time I’ve ever tried food and my mouth gives me a negative repulse. Their carnitas are dyed a certain way to appear appetizing but are extremely dry.  I wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c3350b569fc773:0xdb856114f2c05fe2<//Gmap_id><date>1616345233568</date>< rating>

The reason that I am putting one star is because when you eat outside in the tables, you can't eat in peace.The second reason my family and I didn't like it is because when you order you get mixed up! There ARN'T even chillis so you can get from. When I got my food, I got tacos de asada and I thought the onion was going to be in little pieces like squares, but no it was cut like apples. But that is only my opnion.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) It's not the place I wanted to go but I was just passing through, I was thinking of taking a family pack but they didn't have it available, I think they don't handle it there, I had to buy everything separately.

(Translated by Google) They are a hoax, it annoys me that they have ads outside of food combos and when you ask they tell you that those only that you order them a day before that does not take it is just a hook.announcing an offer and saying that it is not available is not honest.no I recommend it

(Original)
Son un engaño me molesto que tienen anuncios afuera de combos de comida y cuando pides te dicen que esos solo que los ordenes un dia antes eso no se ase solo es un gancho.anunciar una oferta y decir que no esta disponible no es honesto.no lo recomiendo</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I do not recommend this place at all. Carnitas are flavorless. They are like old animals or days because of the smell and dry it. The sauces do not serve the juices either. It's a disgusting place 🤮

<Review>(Translated by Google) Can't fault the carnitas. Very good But the orange juice that I buy is very bad, the orange was already old, already spoiled. I did not return the juice because I was already on the road and I had to throw it away. Jamaica water too much asucar. I did not feel the taste of hibiscus, pure sweet water.

(Original)
No me puedo quejar de las carnitas.  Muy buenas. Pero el jugo de naranja que compre muy malo, la naranja ya estaba pasada, ya echada a perder. No les regrese el jugo porque ya estaba en carretera y lo tube que tirar.  El agua de Jamaica demasiada asucar. No le senti el sabor a jamaica, pura agua dulce.< /Review>< Pictures>

They have nothing on the tables outside. And the cashier came out very salsa and told me that you cannot eat inside when in California they already gave permission and they say that in their restaurant you cannot. Very dry carnitas do not have a rib and in the tacos they put very little onion and cilantro and the onion is not minced. Good luck in your going I do not recommend them.

Mala experiencia no dejan comer adentro y no tenian ni un letrero que digera que no se puede comer adrentro tien sal y pimienta en las mesas de adrentro y no tienen circulado ho cerrado. En las mesas de afuera no tienen nada. Y la cajera salio muy salsa y decirme k no se puede comer adentro cuando en california ya dieron permiso y ellos dicen k en su restaurant no se puede.

This was my first and last time ordering from here. I live 1 hour away from this place and I saw it was getting good reviews online so I decided to try it. I stupidly drove over here to have my order canceled and go home with no pizza and I was told there was nothing that could be done. No friendly service whatsoever. PIKEYS PIZZA WILL NEVER HAVE ME AS A CUSTOMER EVER AGAIN.< /review>

<review>Best Pizza in Town!  Not expecting it from a small store but, wow! Better than most places in the area. Fresh dough and ingredients. Friendly and fast service! Can't beat a large 1 topping carryout for $5.50!</review>< Pictures>

This place used to be Double or Nothing pizza. Now it's Pikey's Pizza which would've been fine but the wait was extremely long. Called in my order and got here a few minutes early. Waited an extra 15 minutes for 2 pepperoni pizzas and wings. It shouldn't have taken so long for 2 one topping pizzas but this place was extremely understaffed. I used to love this last pizza company. So sad...<//text>

Don't let the amazing price fool you. It is delicious and staff is so friendly. Hot wings, wedges, and meatball sub are great too!</text>

Excellent website, great follow-up service & communication. Pizza was a little too greasy, and cheese could be a bit more melted; but pretty good. Grease and cheese hold it back from 5 stars.</Text>

Had the pizza for the first time at my girlfriends house and it was very good.  they actually use REAL cheese.  the cheese had such a good flavor to it as well as the crust.  very good pizza for the price.  would order from them anytime, even for my women's bible study at my church.<//text>

<text>If I could put no stars I would. Absolutely horrible!! Pretty much threw away everything. Took an hour to get my pizza and I live right down the street. I had ordered online and was gonna pick it up myself but I had locked my keys in the car and would have took too long to wait for AAA to come open my door then go pick it up. So I called to deliver instead. Guy told me between 35/45 mins. But was an hour. By the time I got the food, pizza wasn't hott, cheese looked liked rubber. My son, who loves pizza took one bite and didn't want anymore. I could only eat 1. My fiance couldn't eat any cause he has a thing with cheese but usually has no problem with it if it's cooked right. It was undercooked. I got breadsticks that we're flat, and a garden salad with ranch. Worst ranch I have ever tasted. Salad looked like it was bottom of the barrel. I couldn't believe how bad it was, and for $25. Effing waste of money. I should have just gone to little ceasers. I do not recommend this place if your a pizza Friday type family lol<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2d55e49db75a5:0xd833d1c719733401<//gmap_id>< Pics>

I used to come here all the time for there Calzones.  They were made to order and delicious. I live approx 40 minutes away but was always worth the drive.

This time I get there and I'm told they are out of Calzones.... sooo not freshly made anymore ??? Or is it that the guy just didn't want to make one...  super disappointed..<//Review>

Omg guys their pizza is soo good! I got a extra large pizza with jalapeños and pepporoni best part was the cheese. However i didnt like the mozzarella sticks did taste bland but the pizza covered it. I recommend the pizza 👍</Text>

Best service ever better than the dealership! I left feeling comfortable and safe with my car. The employees there did not hesitate to answer any of my questions once or ever. Will definitely be coming back here for car service!<//review>

I couldn't complain if I wanted to. They ordered my tires and sent a driver to get them (2hrs away) so that I could have my vehicle ready at the time they specified. That's over and above the call of duty in my book. They gave me what I wanted, at a price I can live with and completed when they said. Can't get any better than that. I'm a happy customer.</Review>

<Date>1618013825906< /Date><Review>Brought my car in for an oil change, tire rotation, etc...around 10:30. They called to tell me my car was ready around 1pm. Got there to pick up around 4:15. All work was done, car was clean, everything was good. What made it a 5⭐ experience was the light hearted banter of the counter people with the customers. The 5-10 minutes to pay, sign paperwork, etc... felt like a few seconds. Left a very pleasant feeling with me... You don't experience that very often in retail anymore! Guaranteed to come back again and again.< /Review><Name>Bruce Carney< /Name>< Gmap_id>

Very professional, looks for the best deal for your car needs. Over heard several customers who apparently are repeat customers be greeted by name as they walk in and are appreciative of the work done. Car is clean in the shape it was left. They are conscientious of not getting grease on anything. 👍< /Review>

Do not come here for an oil change Shady! Go to the one on Madison Avenue where I serviced before. No oil leaks before in my very clean driveway suddenly pouring oil. Shop said I needed oil pan gasket replace for $800 strange that an oil pan gasket needed to be touched for routine oil change (only the oil drain plug should be touched). If the gasket was removed it would facilitate a need to change because they’re single use. Should not be required to touch this for routine oil change and was not leaking before. Also the other Ramona checked recently the same vehicle it had NOtHING wrong with it.</review>

Ramona Tire on Winchester Road has always been my go-to or call-in a question about A n y t h i n g .... regarding all my vehicles. They’re very responsive. Transparent about pricing. Convenient location.... even if you have to wait , there’s so much other chores you can accomplish from the businesses around them. All the guys are super friendly. Last but not the least, Nader Is The Best! And that’s how i have him written in my contact list.👍🏽</Text>

My daughter told me her tire pressure light came on. I looked and noticed a screw in the tire. She had to go to work in 2 hours, and I was leaving to go out of town for the next few days, so this had to get repaired now. I called Nader and he got it done like a top level closer in the bottom of the 9th with three streak outs to win the game! These guys are awesome and Nader "saved" the day once again!< /text>

Sal Hernandez and service team truly took care of us. We came in for an oil change and tire rotation and were informed we needed an entire new set of tires due to poor alignment. My husband is a firefighter and commutes to work. We appreciated Sal making sure the point inspection was completed and were also given the best deal. They took care of all our service needs. Thanks Ramona Tires!

<review>They take very good care of their customers! I had a flat tire and mike took care of me at the last minute so I can drive safely home. Most places will not take customers 1hr before and not even 30min before closing. I was completely super grateful to them for taking care of me 10min before they closed.< /review>< pictures>

I couldn't complain if I wanted to. They ordered my tires and sent a driver to get them (2hrs away) so that I could have my vehicle ready at the time they specified. That's over and above the call of duty in my book. They gave me what I wanted, at a price I can live with and completed when they said. Can't get any better than that. I'm a happy customer.< /Text>

Dan was great. I was in a pickle and he made it easy for me to get the Wifes car back on the road. Everyone else needed2-3days to get me a tire. He had it in a matter of a few hours. Mama is back on the road and I'm no worse for the wear. Thanks Dan.

I’ve given 3 other shops in Temecula, by business, for various car work, all have ripped me off, Ramona Tires is the only HONEST SHOP, I’ve found doing price comparison, legit work & not called to try to work in unnecessary costs, which all other shops have overpriced & lied about my vehicles, which 2 out of 5 have been serviced by Ramona, I will go no other place, for their specialized work, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE & Honest QUALITY WORK</Text>

Saul is a awesome person!  Their technician Jeff is one of the best.  I live in Orange county and I make the drive just to come to this repair shop because of the quality of work and prices!  Don't go anywhere else for repairs!  You won't be disappointed!<//text>

<review>Arrived at 5:40pm for a quick tire patch. The guy at the front service didn’t hesitate to let me know that he wouldn’t help me because, “he is closing in 5 mins”. I was left with a flat tire simply because the guy didn’t feel like it. I said ok and walked out. There’s no point in arguing, the place is not worth your time. By the way, their website states they close at 6:00pm< /review>< Response>

A service-member left my car unlocked in the parking lot after being serviced and was broken into overnight. I wasn't offered any compensation or even an apology. The service is good, but this incident in unforgivable. Locking a car is common-sense and a part of working on cars. Not cool</text>

They not only displayed a professional and courteous service, but went out of their way to give us the best deal possible. And, they made sure we had our vehicle back ASAP, which we totally appreciated. They literally saved us if you only knew what they had to do to repair our vehicle.

Buyer beware! They will not offer you their price match unless you know about the price match. (Shady/dishonest).
I had to ask before the emplyee tried to quickly hang up on me when I told him that was expensive and asked for a least expensive tire. I informed him I had a cheaper quote elsewhere and I asked him why he failed to tell me they price match and he said " I didn't know you knew about that". And even after I told him America's tire had the same tire he quoted me at $260. each for $157 he still refused to offer the Ramona Tire price match guarantee.<//Text>

<review>I couldn't be more thankful for these Gentlemen . I'm beginning to think I live there.  I go in so stressed, and sometimes crying, but when I leave I'm feeling better because these guys helped make my day less stressful and took care of things I just could deal with.
Thanks to each one.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1562089082769, 'text': 'Thank you for the wonderful review Debra. We care about each and every one of our customers and are very happy we can help out.'}<//resp>< gmap_id>

I have been going here since I moved into town.  The location is next to the mall, so you have so many places to go while waiting.  The guys are easy to talk to and they try to get you in and out as fast as possible.  My one complaint is that they are always busy, but that is probably a good thing.  Don't buy wipers there if you have an Altima.  They swapped the first set out for free, but the second set was only marginally better.< /Review>

Let me tell you something about this shop...in my 50 years I have seen a more dedicated, honest, sincere group of professional mechanics who literally saved me and gave me faith in idea that there are true honest mechanics in this world.  I live in San Diego and will go back to these guys when I need work.  This experience has actually impressed so much, I am considering retiring in Temecula.  Thank you Christian Bennett  and Alec!!!!  You guys are the best!!!!!< /review>

<text>always service friendly, honest, and timely. As a women, I have found that shops keep trying to upsell me and can be very demeaning. I love that Ramona tire gives me options, is not pushy and always up front. I have gone and done my own research after a recommendation and they are right on target ~ not trying to sell me something I don't need or can do myself (like air filters). I will always remain loyal for their honesty.< /text>< Date>

<time>1531446946871<//time><review>We stopped to get tires the shift changed, or someone went on break..... We went ate lunch and checked out theshopping center they are in. We got back and he said they had just found the order to put two tires on, it had been misplaced. I never seem a guy take off, balance, and put back on two tires so fast nine minutes. If the management was as good as the installers we wouldnt have even gone to lunch..... This earns a three star, the installer the guy who rides the motorcycle is really good at what he does.< /review>< pics>

I have to say, this group has some great prices on tires.  Customer service has been decent, and I haven't had too many problems with up-selling.  The group is fast, and they open early, which is nice.  I really appreciate the work they do.</Review>

<review>These guys do more than just tires and will save you hundreds!  Plus they’re FAST; they fixed my engine issues & replaced all 4 of my tires within 90 minutes.  Sal was such an amazing help.  He found me better prices on everything I needed.  My husband is deployed and I was nervous about potentially getting swindled at a car shop.  These guys treated me with respect & kindness.  Sal solved my engine issues for 300 less than other mechanics had quoted, plus the firestone warranty can’t be beat!   I could not be happier and recommend Ramona Tire Firestone in Temecula to everyone.   HUGE shoutout to Sal.  Thank you, my friend!<//review>< Response>

The folks there are friendly, informative, & knowledgeable, when servicing my 2005 Subaru Baja, even when they have to go the extra mile. and order special parts from the dealer.  I feel that they go the extra mile because they want you to be satisfied and comeback.  I know I will.<//text>

I found them by accident and I'm glad I did. The people are SUPER, the service is spot on, professional and done right. I have a lifted Jeep and purchased the lifetime front end alignment, have used them more than my fair share and they continue to treat me as a new client every time!

I highly recommend them.< /review>

I paid for 5 quart oil change and after 2 months my car stalls in middle of street and my low engine oil light came on. Long story short I had to walk to gas station put a whole bottle in and I was fine. I was upset that I didnt' get a proper oil change, or perhaps was never done in first place. So I called them and spoke with service manager.

Without being rude I explained the problem about them either not doing an oil change in first place or lying about the 5 quarts. My car has no leaks and driveway is clean. I asked him what he can do to make it up to me or keep me as a customer. He got defensive and said, "What you want me to do give 200-300 dollar service for FREE!" "I feel like your hustling me" very unprofessional and not taking ownership of a bad oil change and service.

He even said I should have seen him when it happened so they can look at it. LMAO. I had no oil in my car to make it to them. Use at your own risk< /Text>< pictures>

<text>A tire was replaced under their Hazard Damage coverage for new tires. Saul quoted the previous day that it will cost me $20 but Joey Hernandez charged me &30 for the service. Tire was replaced and the rest of the tires rotated. I came back later to inform  Hernandez of a mistake they made, one tire wheel lug nut was not the car's original and the car wrench cannot grip it, Hernandez was dismissive of  the complaint like it was fault. My recommendation: Joey Hernandez should not be interacting with Ramona clients.

<review>Ramona Tire has the best service of all of the tire chains.  I have now been in a situation twice where I was stranded out of town and Ramona went out of their way to take care of me and my family.  The Mission Viejo store stayed open late one night to make sure they could have my car in for service first thing in the morning to get me back home.   Today my children got stuck in Temecula and they fixed them right up to get them on their way home.

Plus, they alway have or obtain the exact tire I need during my routine tire changes.< /review>< rate>

<text>Ramona tires gave me the best price in town for my RV and when it came down to it they didn't have the tires in stock they couldn't get them in time for me so they switched him to a more expensive tire and didn't charge me for it great guys there at Ramona tire I recommend them highly< /text>< pics>

Oof I love this place. Wednesdays they have great deals on bottles of wine and their pizzas and appetizers are DELICIOUS. Oh and THERE IS PARKING!!!! Everyone working here is always super friendly and service is super quick! Lovely seating area outside and the indoor space is just as beautiful. Definitely a great place to go on a cooler evening because the amazing wood burning oven keeps it nice and toasty inside.<//text>

Great bread with marinara sauce.
Romanos pasta dish is also extremely good.
Poorly lit with OK service. If they just switched their existing lights to accent lighting facing walls it would make the ambiance so much better. But overall a good dinner.<//Review>

First time ever going here and will never be back. Apparently, people who gave this place more than 1 star have very low to no expectations of servers. The guy at the front counter was so RUDE that we just left. Just because you're a server, doesn't give you the right to be RUDE. Get some manners!</review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Amazing food!!! Small place, kind of hidden, but the food was spectacular.  When we first sat down they brought out delicious garlic rolls with marinara sauce. I thought, ooh I think we are going to like the good here. Then comes the $6 bruschetta comes out. Best I've ever had. Our was a huge appetizer made perfectly. Still can't believe it was only $6! Our waiter was fantastic and recommended some dishes for us. My husband ordered their house specialty, "Romano" I was very happy that he was willing to share a few bites with me because it was fantastic. I ordered the stuffed pasta with spinach and artichoke. Also amazing. My husband was glad that I shared a few bites with him :)  We had fun discussing whose dish was better and both agreed that we were glad to have both. I love in LA county but will definitely be stopping here to eat anytime I happened to be driving down the 5 fwy again! What a great find!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcf39bc749bb7f:0xc116b9c06b2f481a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Now that the stores are back open, you still can't go in and look at any products. The employee (manager?) that came out to talk with me was very nice. He gave me a sheet of paper with a phone number and the note to call LOYALTY TEAM to disconnect the line to my Chromebook which fell apart after one month and I had to return to Samsung but there's no such thing as a loyalty team and I still had to wait a half an hour on the phone for someone to answer.  The phone number listed here is not answered by people in the store and it goes to the Verizon customer service where you again wait and wait and wait and wait for someone to talk to you.<//text>< name>

< Review>
Drove to this corporate store as recommended by 2 other stores located in different towns.  Sales people said open hours were in place until 7pm.  We rushed to Citrus Heights only to have the door closed and locked as we tried to get hrough door at 6:30pm, without an explanation.  I stood at the door anyway.  An employee approached the door laughing that they were closed.  I explained I just needed a return envelope so I could return my trade-in.  She stated nowhere does it indicate in their advertising that the open hours are until 7pm.  It actually states it everywhere, even on the voicemail when I called the store to speak with a manager at that moment.  Incredibly rude people.  I will not be going therea gain and will consider dropping my 22-year patronage.  Zero stars would be given, if possible.</Review>

Unfortunately there is only so much they can do in store. Most things need to be taken care of through calling the support line. Each of my 3 calls had over a 30 minute initial wait time and then more time on hold as I was passed along to the person who could help. All of them were kind and helpful, but I finally needed to switch carriers to find the type of in store customer support and phones that will work for my parents.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< Review>
We had the worst experience with Verizon yesterday and this store and workers literally offered no solution except go to an authorized retailer or wait four days (since it was the weekend) for the phones to be shipped. Found out we couldn’t even go to an authorized retailer because the promotion we wanted could only be through a corporate store. We couldn’t wait for the phones to be shipped either as my phone had stopped making and receiving calls two days prior. Also called the 800 number provided to be told we couldn’t pick the phones we wanted up at any store within 50 miles because there wasn’t a corporate store for pickup yet we were standing right at this corporate store. All of this happened after credit was already ran for the phones. We eventually gave up on Verizon and went right down the road to AT&T, received excellent customer service and left in under an hour with the exact two phones we originally wanted from Verizon but for even cheaper. Thanks for nothing Verizon and thanks for everything AT&T. After this experience we will definitely discourage anyone we know from going with Verizon. Poor customer service.< /Review>

They do provide excellent service; my main problem is that they make you wait for a very long time before assisting you. This would mean simply buying a new phone or updating a contract would take hours at the store, and a majority of this time is waiting to be assisted.< /review>

<Review>Zac was very helpful. Though we opted to wait for upgrades, we didn't feel pressured and/or pushed to make a purchase today. Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of care taken during this time. One downside was the wait time. Waited nearly 45 minutes to get helped. Would definitely recommend more staff. Especially on a Friday during the evening when a lot of people are getting off work and need assistance.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1567966733893, 'text': "Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review, Jake!

When reading the reviews I was skeptical about coming into this one, however, I have experienced nothing bit great customer service from everyone. Jaime assisted me with adding a line, Albert was extremely helpful with an issue I had. The whole staff is very patient and kind.</review>

I will be honest though, coverage and internet speed is slower than I expected. Is there a reason for this?</Review>< Pics>

Theres a nice intelligent man that works here, with a beard, who actually is great, and they're lucky to have him! This is for Michael, whom didnt want to honor the list price of iPads on display today while we added to our plan. He claimed it was from black friday specials, which was a full week ago. I said can you ask your manager, he came out saying "are you sure you want to honor that", to the manager, who said yes. When he came over he now tried saying that wed have to buy a phone in order to get that price, or pay 50 more for the actual price its supposed to be, which seemed to be a total lie and made up. He immeditely took the label off of the iPads once I told him no thanks and didnt want to waste anymore time! I doubt he'll last long with how unhelpful he is, I know he wants to save his daddy's money by not honoring prices listed, even when asked why there were no fine prints saying restrictions apply, to indicate a phone would need to be purchased for that price, his response was just that the label is very vague and that hes here to explain, which hes there to not sell it looks like. If a manager says go ahead I'm not sure why hed make up stories but I didnt want to stay any longer and had to leave. Unreal.</Review>

Clearly the staff in your stores are only there to sell phones.   We were referred to 611 and have been on hold for over an hour.  The staff at your store did not stay with us to solve the issue just passed us off to a toll free number.  We needed to reactivate a  phone that had previously been on the network.< /Review>

<review>Depends on who you get to work with. Some people are VERY nice and helpful, others are actually douchey pieces of crap I personally wouldn't employ. To each their own of course. Oh and I've never been here when it isn't busy, which seems to feed the employees taking their damn time with each customer. 'Oh we're gonna be busy anyways, just let em wait' seems to be the attitude. Oh well, still most convenient store to me so..< /review><user>117989777725828113699<//user>< pics>

So I went on line to Verizon to buy a new one the same model. I found it on best buy website and bought it. I paid for my plan before the change and was not told you can't transfer the funds to your new phone. But it didn't matter. I went to best buy to have it exchanged for one that works. They refused because it was past 10 days. I didn't know this. Then they sent me to Verizon. They refused to exchange it and told me to go to Motorola. This is not customer service! This is passing the buck! I was so frustrated with Verizon I told them to keep the phone. And stormed out of the store. Angry & majorly dissatisfied. This is the perfect way to loose new customers like me. And existing customers too. #majorverizonfail</review>< gmap_id>

I wouldn't give this verizon store a star but I have to so I can share this review. Stay away from this verizon store at Birdcage!!!  My father who is 78 went in this store looking for a phone for traveling and emergencies only. He came out with a flip phone, hum, and adaptor with a 2 year contract.  I called verizon customer service about my father’s purchase.  The customer service rep said to bring the phone back within 48 hrs from the purchase date and he would be able to return his phone/hum/adaptor without any charges. When we arrived at the store the service rep did cancel the contract and we were able to return the phone/hum/adaptor, but not without a restocking fee of $35 each.  I asked the verizon rep if they could waive the restock fee because of my dad’s age and with him not understanding what she was selling him at the time.  She said she would have to talk to her manager.  She walked into the back office and within 30 seconds returned with a, “sorry, we can’t do that.”  So my dad paid the $105 to return the equipment that they removed from the box and set it up for him.  It was an expensive lesson for my father.  I have heard other horror stories of this store from co-workers and acquaintances and even the other Verizon stores say that this store gets so many complaints all of the time.  Because of their ethics, I would suggest, keep any elderly person, if not everyone you know away from this place. If you are looking to upgrade by trading in your old phone to help pay for your upgrade, they will try to get you purchase accessories with your phone credit. Their ideology is for you to use that phone credit for accessories not for the upgrade.<//text>

<review>This Verizon store unfortunately reflects my experience with not only other Verizon stores , but the company as a whole. I would have to write for hours on my negative experience with Verizon, so I will try and keep it short. First off this store location has an arrogant and condescending manager and staff 95% of the dozens of times I came in. I have been told / sold to and made choices, only to be told later that the rep was violating Verizon rules...but that does not matter because you the little guy will have the eat it. 2nd They sale you on a  buy one get one free phone and but good luck on the 792 dollar rebate. Every time I call into rebate center, they have an excuse why they didn't send it...from strangely my zip code showing as New Jersey,  where the "rebate is invalid" ,even though my copy sent it has my CA zip, to the new added line showing Verizon did a number change instead of a new number, even though it is a new number and an added line, which was a part of the criteria for the Bogota offer. I have spent virtually dozens of hours on the phone with dealing with billing problems and one 4 hours on the phone with the rebate problem...yet they are charging extea fees according get to Verizon because of the cost of "customer service" man hours! Go figure, you can't collect a dime when their sales people cause you financial harm and it takes a day off work and all day on the phone to fix it. (And still not fixed)  3rd. The plans are changing so often and are so confusing, partially because the plan is according to the sales person who is interpreting wrong at best and in some cases "working the Verizon system" to make the sale. When you make a choice based on what the rep is telling you only to find out he lied and this compounds other problems you already may have, they can not handle it...combined problems from their creation of what seems to be purposeful chaos,  is too many levels deep for anyone who already is acting arrogant and condescending. So it appears that companies, like Verizon, make out like robber barons because "Money Out of Chaos" works for them. As soon as I possibly can, I will be leaving this company, it maybe sooner because the rebate is still not in my hands, soon they will be eating a very big bill. The phones $1600 in phones will be kept as collateral until they pay the bill I send them for consuming massive amounts of time, causing great stress and not honoring the apparent lies and bad sales the employees make. It is just a matter of time before everyone has to experience such a horrible company and they take their business somewhere else. When Google (such a stellar top notch company and the Google shrine with candles in my bedroom has nothing to do with it) rolls out with their worldwide cell and Internet service, they will be putting all these robbers out of business. In my opinion, Avoid Verizon like the Black Plague...this is my experience and may not be everyones and does not reflect the handful of great people who have went above and beyond to fix any problems. This reflects the company as a whole and the employees that support such bad service, attitudes lack of abilitiy to correct issues and the pursuit of money at the expense of people at a level that would make the worst NY slum lords look like Mother Teresa.< /review><gmap_id>0x809ade237bee8277:0x248ba972344196ff< /gmap_id>< user_name>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I have been paying $240 a month to Verizon for what I thought a superior service.  This Verizon store has shattered this believe with employees who are horrible at listening and helping. The staff here cannot tell if Verizon sim card works or not. I had to go to apple store to get my iPhone checked and sim card tested on another phone and comeback so that Verizon employees can properly register a sim card. When tried to bring this issue up with Umar who works there, instead of listening he started coming up with excuses. I had to get to manager to finally make them understand that Verizon staff should be smart enough and trained enough to tell if a sim card they installed is properly registered. Just horrible service and complete ignorance of front staff!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

They do a great job, when they're not rushing... Unfortunately they're always rushing any more. Got a full set and a pedicure. The nails turned out uneven, sloppy and are already lifting. She rushed through them while I was getting my pedicure. I couldn't enjoy the pedicure because she was grabbing at my hands... Granted I called same day for an appointment, but I still had one. They treated me like I walked in and demanded to be seen.  I'll be finding a new nail salon.< /review>

<Text>This photo is after a couple days but I’m always happy when I come here. Tina is amazing, she remembers you and really great to talk to. They do a good job, nothing over the top but they listen to your needs, give suggestions and are usually very flexible with timing. Great place!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Got my nails done 2 weeks ago.  It only took 30 minutes like he was rushing.  2 days later the polish began to peel and 1 nail broke.  Decided to give another try and made a new appointment.  They called same day of appointment to cancdel with no offer to reschedue.  I expressed my displeasure and she simply said "ok sorry -good bye"  Very unprofessional.</text><date>1610741176309< /date><user>105359564261889180872</user>< Response>

I've been coming here for over 15 years to get pedicures. Everyone who works here takes great attention to detail. I always get the deluxe pedicure for more relaxation purposes. I can't wait to go back!<//review>

I had a quiet, soothing spa pedicure experience. Technicians weren't jabbering away to each other, the massage chairs are awesome, it's clean and nicely decorated. Great leg/foot massage too. My skin is super smooth. I will for sure be coming back.</Review>

First off my name is SHANNA and the word is picky not piggy unless you was referring to my size . and yea it took you 90mins because you didnt know how to do what I wanted after you said that you can another thing you confirmed with me an appointment until you saw who I was and changed your mind that was wrong and very rude and also a waste of people's time you're right I do go somewhere else but at that time I had a nail emergency and I Resort it to you as my last option but that's why I choose not to come in there and I did come back and get my money the first time this time you still charge me $10 for eyebrows that grow in a week great also while you're having time to write a review go ahead and change that are acrylics since everybody's nails are breaking within the first week have a good day<//Text>

Freedom Park is a beautiful park that is taken care of by North Highlands Recreation and Park District.  Located next to the California Aerospace Museum, the park is in an excellent location.  The park itself has a large play structure that was perfect for my four year daughter to play at.  In addition, the park features a Splash Pad, Tot Lot, swings, and a lot of open space for kids to run around.</Text>

<Review>Great big park. Lot's to do. Multiple playgrounds, a little splash park, basketball court. Lots of tables for parites. Not a lot of trees so very little shade unless your under a gazebo. But awesome and fun !! Kids and parents of all ages will have fun.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>Great for kids who like to climb. Everything in main park is pretty high off the ground. Smaller childrens park is nice, great for the little ones. Lots of shaded seating, no shade in the park areas. Mediocre splash pad. Overall its an okay place to bring the kids.</Text>< Pics>

This park blew me away with the biggest slides I have seen at a public park. The theme is space shuttles. It has the big slide, climb and explore area, a smaller area for the littles, a ride on area, splash pad for cooling off and several big covered bench areas. This park does have little shade if toy are not under the covered areas...but sometimes that is okay!</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Absolutely wonderful surroundings, huge open airy spaces, lots of trees providing comfortable shading from the burning hot summer sun, a small children's play area, BBQ areas, just the place to spend a relaxing day.. lying on the soft grass, doing absolutely nothing.
California aerospace museum right next door.</review>< pictures>

This park was very well taken care of, and after so many times I have visited this place, I see rats are running around in the bushes right next to kids playground. This specific area has large homeless community, and I have nothing against homeless friendly people as long as they stay friendly. Restrooms are not clean at all, it's scary to touch anything there.<//Text>

My 4 year old stepson had an absolute blast at this park. So many things to do. Big playground. Little playground. Toys and swings. There's also a water park (splash sprinklers) that are open from July-September. Tons of kids to play with too.

We will definitely be returning.<//Text>

I like this park, everytime I come and visit it makes me feel patriotic, the water park is now on from 12 to 7, and it's just really nice and beautiful, there's places for little ones and big ones here. I all around love it.< /Text>

Several pavilions are available for picnics and grilling along with public restrooms (although you can tell they're well used). It's right next to the California Aerospace Museum which is a great place to visit as well. Finally, it's on the McClellan airfield so you get to watch planes the whole time you're here.

The park is great it's one of our favorites. We love how they put alot of thought into the design of the playground it's totally unique. Haven't seen another one like it & wish there were more like it. It also has this really cool water fountain thing you can play in to keep cool.<//review>

Great fun for kids all ages. The waterpark opens at 12pm-2pm all summer. The park is very clean and has a ton of shade.</Review>

This is a really nice park to bring your kids to or throw a party at most of the time. It does have a tendency to have homeless people around, BUT, they don't bother you.<//Text>

Great place to bring the kids to run and play. We also have BBQ's and have had plenty of birthdays to. In the summer they have a little water splash area for the kids to run and get wet. They also have a nice big basketball court<//text>

<text>There is a very nice playground for kids. There are a lot of benches to sit and be able to watch your kids play. There are also very nice tables w benches very close to the playground.

There are also old military planes parked behind a fence behind the playground. My kids loved being able to look at them so close.< /text>< pics>

Freedom park is great! Tons of open area as well as a great playground. 2 slides are blocked off right now that need repairs but it didn't stop my son from having a great time!</text>

<text>Great selection of multiple creative play areas, as well as lots of shaded sitting areas.
Multiple play areas enable plenty of room for young kids to spread out to the challenges they think are appropriate for themselves.
There are also well maintained bathrooms, a water play area in the summer, and a bouldering wall with ropes to balance on.</text><gmapID>0x809ad88d74e5b7f7:0x95263a71aac60651< /gmapID>< user>

There's a water area for when the weather is hot, two play areas, one for the younger kids, and a 3 story play area for the older kids. It has hoops and swings, wide open areas for playing soccer, football, ect. Baseball field behind the park. Great place to have parties. There are four different sections to rent for parties and even when it's full of people, there is still plenty room for everyone. Bathrooms could use a little extra care.<//text>

It's a great park when the homeless aren't around. Hate it when they go shower in the kids water park, it's really disgusting the way it stinks when they're there.< /Text>

Nice and very clean park!  It appears they do have water during the summer too.  There is place for toddlers and older kids.  The swings; however, are very noisy.  They might need some oil.<//review>

This park was fun, and has several different things for kids to play on. However, it was sad to see that is is worn down. Some slides are closed off, but there was still plenty to do.< /text>

I love this park. It's a great place for get togethers.  There's BBQ pits, covered picknic tables, large grassy areas for pets to roam and even a large gated kidy playground for your kids to have fun.< /text>

Perfect for what it is-a medium size kid/ family oriented park.  There's 5 or so separate play areas that are appropriate for different age groups,  a small water play ground and lots of covered picnic tables.</text>

Pretty park with a nice covered  place to picnic, but every time I  stop by there a heavy odor of cigarette smoke is coming from the bathrooms. I would rather not use their bathrooms. I believe this park is not used as intended. I would never let a child go here. Even though I see that groups of handicapped adults use it and this is a goos thing,, I think the bathrooms are too dirty and unsafe feeling.<//review>

<Review>Reserved the large picnic area there was nothing marking it as reserved and there was dried cake all over the tables and people at the tables we had to ask them to leave. When we tried to get ahold of someone about it that day no one ever answered and they seriously said it was from us. The staff was extremely rude and I'll never spend my money r on a reservation from them ever again.</Review>< username>

Four large covered picnic areas make this a great spot for group picnics and BBQs. There's also a large playground for the kids and numerous basketball courts.</Review>

HORRIBLE!!! Yesterday was my baby shower I paid 135 dollars to book the space. I was asked what time i would arrive during booking. I asked if everything would be clean and the bathrooms to. I was insured it would. When I arrived there was caution tape up...which I hope was part of the reserving so people would know its booked because we took it down. It wad sun flower seeds everywhere on the ground trash not emptied...like where in the memo was bring ur own broom. I left my husband to start grilling and received a call saying the parks man showed up saying I needed to sign paper work. But clearly both our names are on the billboard and he had the confirmation email and permit number also. He asked him would he be cleaning up the man looked at him said I just need your wife to sign papers hopped in his white work van and voomed off. I rushed back up there after receiving the call. There is no number to call on weekends I was furious! And the man never came back ever!!! So imagine a nicely decorated a event with a filthy ground...and sunflower seeds everywhere I was like texas roadhouse...with no clean up. The bathrooms were disgusting when I took my daughter...all this was early morning so I could understand if it got dirty during the day. No it just was never cleaned at all. Im very upset I wanted to cancel but everyone was coming from out of town. Sucks so be cautious...im just mad I was insured it would be clean when I paid for it...i was better off showing up at a random park and decorating tables if I wanted something dirty like that...my space out of all thing should have been cleaned.</text>

(Translated by Google) Good park. Open entrance, lots of slides, swings, some closed, but fun for the kids. Covered areas with tables / benches, you can eat, fry the meat. At the weekend there are many kids. Great parking lot.

(Original)
Гарний парк. Відкритий вхід, багато гірок, качелей, деякі закриті, але дітям весело. Криті зони з столами/лавками, можна поїсти, пожарити мясо. На вихідних багато діток.  Велика стоянка.< /Review>
