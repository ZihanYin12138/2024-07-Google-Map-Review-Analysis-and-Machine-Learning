Friendly, helpful staff. A large variety of wholesome foods and products for our dogs & cats. AMAZING. The staff is absolutely incredible. I wish I got the name of the lovely woman who took the time to play  and give him treats. This quick stop for dog food turned into loyalty to such an amazing pet store.<//review>

<Text>This place is great! I got my puppy Kobe from here 3 months ago he’s a German Shepherd Chihuahua mix. I was waiting to make sure everything with our vet was clear before reviewing this place. The first few months we got him were just typical puppy problems deworming and shots, nothing too drastic. He is such a joy to have around. We will definitely be getting another puppy and maybe even kitten from here. The only thing I wasn’t sure about was that they want you to get them spayed/neutered in a certain time limit. In reality when I told my vet about it he recommended that we wait a year. It all depends on the dog breed. Kobe still has some teeth to grow so unfortunately I might not qualify for my deposit. But I guess we’ll see when I get him neutered. I’m supposed to have technically done it in September, but my vet said he’s too young. Other than that, this place is great!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I love this place. They've recently turned their pet store into a rescue and I love it even more. We took our kids to get Guinea Pigs the staff was awesome, very informative and helpful. They have Pups, Guinea Pigs, Rabbits, Cats, Chinchillas, Birds, didnt see any reptiles.

We are pleased with all purchases from Guinea Pigs to Pups from them and plan to continue to purchase or adopt in the future.<//Text>

Family owned business. Clean, staff is helpful with answering questions. Puppies, kitties, birds and guinea pigs for kids to look at (and maybe take home) and the legend Carl, who's the coolest store peacock! I love supporting a mom and pop shop!< /review>

This store owner has the biggest heart and deserves more credit.. she has been taking care of the cat I returned because he was aggressive and nobody really wants him but she keeps him because she doesn’t want him going to the pound. She has another cat in the back named pirate that nobody wants because of his eye- she doesn’t have to keep them but she does because she makes sure any pets that go to that store go to a loving home or else she’s responsible for them. I will be getting my cat back because we just got a bigger home so I’m pretty excited to have my baby back. I honestly am so grateful she kept him and didn’t give up on him. Love this store!<//Review>

I liked it because they have a lot of animals that are up for adoption and need good homes, and for reasonable prices as well. They have a great selection of birds, cats, dogs, and lots of supplies as well as kennels cages and food and treats. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking to adopt a small kitten or a dog oh, the people are also very friendly and informational.<//Text>

<Text>Never knew of this place until I was told they sold a dog food I was looking for. Went in and to my surprise, there were dogs in crates stacked on top of each other!  These dogs were packed in these crates and were fighting and biting each other!!! Some were yelping because they were being bit and one was so small it could not do anything but lay there and be bit and yelp! Someone needs to take these dogs from them and place them in a place where they are humanely treated....so sad!<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>I had bought 4 adult guinea pigs and 1 baby from here about 1 1/2 months ago and they are sweet. But I have been back and forth at the vet for fungal infections and ringworm! The owner of this place says she takes good care of them, but fungal just doesn't happen overnight or stay that persistent and resistant to treatment, I will never shop here again. I should have gone some where, where a guinea pig person knows what they are doing. I found one after my visit here.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>I bought my dog there 3 years ago and she was beautiful and healthy. They have the cutest puppies there. My children and I go there sometimes just to look at the puppies we cant get enough of them.They have really good prices too.  My dog gets groomed there every couple of months and she loves it she has this i think im bad attitude when i pick her and she always looks good. The staff is really nice too. This place has lots of cute outfits and pet suppies. I look forward to going there even if its just to see the new puppies.<//review>< Pictures>

Bought my baby kitty here 6 years ago, best customer service. My cat had a hard time switching to different food so the gave me the medication for free and gave me great tips and now he is the happiest little boy ever. I will always buy pets from here as long as I live in California<//review>

Bought two kittens from here about 6 months ago. Theyre both my happy and healthy little monsters now. But when we first got them one was sick. They never told me anything about it at all. Said they were both healthy and played off him not really being playful as just a mellow attitude. Be weary of this shop</Text>

< review>
Was continually ignored, finally asked for help and was told someone would assist me. As I waited someone came to the front but instead of asking who needed help walked past me and helped a customer who barely just walked in.  I only saw someone up in the front once. Everyone seemed to be off somewhere in the back. Also had to fix the water in the guinea pig tub because it was broken and the second I fixed it they rushed to get water and fought over it. No one also seemed to notice the fact I was messing with the water bottle.</review>

<username>Selene Escobar< /username><rate>2<//rate><Review>Bad experience. Owner continuously just ignored my presence when trying to inquire about a potential fur baby.  Only question she sort of answered was when she pointed at the wall to answer a question as saying "ummm your answer is there" SMH
Older lady just has no customer service and can come off as rude.
Side Note:  Info on the the wall states all puppies come from rescues but all have different prices as if price based on breed or cuteness and not on age group, size as legit rescue groups . Couldn't find rescued group info when looking them up.</Review></record>

Mixed experiences. The mother is very professional and knowledgable. She helps as much as she can. The daughter on the other hand is worthless and rude. Does not try to do all she can to help a customer. It is very transparent who the passion to actually run the store.< /text>

Absolutely horrible experience!!  This lady sold us a cat with fleas so now I have to spray no whole house and needed to put the car in the garage for the night. Before you sell animals you should know how to take care of them!!  Awful place and I will never be back to this dump where the dogs and cats are caged up in small little cages w no room to get around. Disgusting!!!!  Owner and the poor animals completely disgusting!!!!</text>

<Review>Great tasting, freshly grilled Mediterranean food, at a reasonable price point, in Vernon? Yep!

This is a franchise and you'd be skeptical that all are the same, but so far the Commerce, Vernon and Long Beach locations have not disappointed. The recipes are seemingly the same across the board, and service had been courteous and fast at all.

I personally recommend the chicken kebabs (and I'm typically beef all the way in any setting but the chicken kebab is exceptionally well seasoned).

Don't overlook the family deals as well, great value.<//Review><userid>115433856150173142897<//userid>< username>

I ordered thru postmates and man let me tell u this is the worst Mediterranean foood I ever had.. the hummus was garbage it seemed as if you guys packed 2 nights ago in the deli container the pita was garbage also. Try Z Falafel for some better Mediterranean  food</Review>

<name>erika alcaraz</name><text>I've lived in Boyle Heights & East L.A. forever & never knew this place existed, I came across it on IG one of my most favorite foods in gyros but they have to have the meat that is carved in restaurant not that gross frozed pre formed garbage that some "Mediterranean restaurants" sell..I ordered the Gyro which came served with a side salad, pickled beets & a pepperoncini and I also ordered the Gyro Mix which is gyro meat,chx kabob,beef kabob, hummus, & a side salad with 1 pita bread...also ordered an order of churros they were pictured as a bag with small churros but it only ended up being 1 regular sized churro & it had a bavarian type filling which was not stated on their google map page...both combos were for myself as I was sampling their meats as I was thinking of ordering catering for Friday...all the food was perfect even the presentation in their to-go boxes, all meats were seasoned & tender (beef is extremely tender you can pull pieces straight off the kabob), rice was fluffy, plates came with 2 sauces definately the green sauce is the best...highly recommended! Something about Mediterranean food that leaves you content & satisfied (not overstuffed) maybe it's the fresh ingredients</text><Time>1593471753581< /Time>< pics>

<review>This is a review of the Vernon Location. It's ok. If you have never been to a Green Olive you might even like it. But if you have ever been to the Commerce or Downey location this place will be disappointing. My Rice was not fully cooked, the Humus had no flavor, and the green sauce was not the same. The Chicken and Beef kabob where good though so those are redeeming factors. If you like this place and have never been to Commerce or Downey, do yourself a favor and take the drive. It's night and day.< /review>< resp>

<review>Edit: 11 months later and they still don't follow their own posted hours both on Google and on their own website.  Why bother?  There's so many other Mediterranean shops in the area that don't lie about their hours.

Literally the worst hours. How are they even still in business?</review>< userid>

Asian owner, I'm assuming is very rude. Never sees me when I go to pick up an order. Clearly spoke to the other Asian gentlemen. Just overlooked me. I was there first. The rest of the staff was super awesome to me. Appreciated that.< /text>

Didn't want to review after my first visit because of the slow service but my 2nd time here was even worse . The food is delicious but both times I've been I've had to wait close to 30 minutes for my food, while I see other patrons who came after me get their food.</Review>

So when a place like this is reviewed of course it would get high stars. Central LA people have easliy pleased taste buds : /  Ordered #7. Pros; Lunch hour. Order was ready within minutes. (thank god because the parking smelled of urine and the smell got in the cafe.) The plate looked tasty. Cons; Food no bueno. I wanted to eat my salad but an untasty yogurt dressing was on the salad. Would have liked it on the side. Hummus tasted store bought. Rice was not soft or moist. Rice tatsted like Hispancs would want their mediterranean rice to taste like.(if that makes sense) Chicken was okay. Wished it was moist and marinated longer. The more I ate of the plate the less I liked the food. Thought to myself that I didn't want to continue putting below par food in my body. Last few bites I had to force myself to eat it. Will not be returing here.</review>< Pics>

<Text>I drive for Landstar and this is by far the smoothest most well run DC I have seen in 8 years of driving. The driver check in procedures are completely no contact/no talk with quick and clear directions. This place should be used as a working classroom to teach efficient DC design and procedures. The only possible improvement would be to add a large sign directing drivers to have their 84xxx PO numbers ready, because drivers back up the line being unprepared. Otherwise an absolutely outstanding DC.< /Text><user_name>Dave B</user_name>< Pictures>

Fill out paper in tube, hit button,  receive paperwork & trailer location.

<Review>place is smoothe operation just wish my dispatcher would have given me the correct pick up numbers it would have saved me some time. when you arrive at least 30 minutes before appointment time. They use the tube system here. there will be a small piece 0f paper to fill out for check in and place your drivers license inside with the filled out slip. if you are dropping off place the BOL inside with DL & slip. they will give you a slip telling you what door to go to and the next steps after loading or unloading.<//Review>< pics>

Absolutely the worst shipper/receiver to pick up from. It takes entirely too long to check/out here. Loads are overweight, no one communicates with the driver. Just a waste of time. I'll DECLINE any future loads to or from this place. I'd rather jump in the middle of the pacific ocean with no life jacket than to return here. Fire all the guys who load trucks here, they couldn't load fire wood in a pickup truck. Just all around, POOR service here and a clock killer. Two times, I have been overweight. Absolutely ridiculous.< /text>

It's always at least 30 minutes to check in as they use the vacuum tube system. You have to write your truck, trailer, and pick up number down. Then they Mumble to you in the speaker that they can't read your writing and it takes another 10 minutes for you to shout out all the numbers so they can clearly understand it.  Sometimes it takes another half hour to check out bobtail because no one is on the check out side.<//Text>

I applied for work there I was told they have slow days and busy days,  but did not get a call back about the job. I don't think this place should be allowed to hire the people they are hiring if they are not legal citizens. I am not happy with General Mills<//Review>

<text>Great pediatric dentist! My 3year old son loves going to the dentist. He actually gets excited when he knows he has an appointment. The staff has been very kid friendly and gentle when treating him. I love that when treating him they make sure to tell him step by step so he doesn’t get scared. I definitely recommend Children’s Happy Teeth. Thank you Lisa for helping us on our last appointment and making my son comfortable before his cleaning and check up.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dd2b53689efc6d:0x5cbd475e20fe6c6c< /gmap_id><Rate>5</Rate><Pics>None<//Pics>< userid>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>So far so good! I took my daughters (ages 5 & 6) and they LOVED it. I took them to a dentist in Long Beach, 6 months ago, and they didn’t really like it, because it was nowhere near as kid-friendly as this place. The wait was about 20 mins to be seen, but there’s so much fun for the kids to do while waiting that they didn’t even notice how long we were waiting. They took x-rays, cleaned their teeth and did a thorough check up on their teeth within 30 mins. They were so kind and caring toward my girls, which is something I always look for! They treat them as individuals, they talked with them and were very gentle with everything they did on them. We have another appointment to get them some “baby root canals” and I will update this post on how that goes!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5VKJSGhI2N4IFKBmPmbvLVd4ZScM6-d__515H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDqp6mXeZ5eiosBq1fv9LR-PJMar8VkrqCHGOc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBf3SUIsH7PjVhXoFkphct2nBjKm_v3KGDnFTp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Absolutely love this office! They always take care of us. This was my daughters first visit doing dental work and dr.Anne was amazing and her assistant  mckayla was awesome. Dr.Anne walked my daughter through every step explaining everything that was happening and love the fact she disguised the shot so she had no idea. Overall a great experience will forever come here!<//text>

This place was recommended to me because of how good the staff is with kids and let me tell you, we love the staff so much!! My daughter had to get work done by dr Anne and her assistant Lisa and they were amazing. My daughters was calm the entire time and both dr Anne and Lisa were so nice to her and helped my daughter feel comfortable and safe. My son who is also terrified of the dentist did amazing here and loves to come here. Highly recommend this is place<//review>

Brought my son for a tooth extraction and I have to say... it was a great experience. Dr. Ann and Monica were great with my son from start to finish. I'm used to going in and being told what their going to do and then they do it and just briefly tell you what your son/daughter shouldn't do for the day, but Dr. Ann took it a step further and was extremely thorough with her work asking me to get up and show me exactly what she was going to do, showed me how the area of extraction was completely numb so my son wouldn't feel any pain, and then being kind enough to walk me through the dental instructions. Both my son and myself walked out of there with a positive experience.  Highly recommend this place and Dr. Ann👍<//Review>

Been coming to this dental office since my first son was born he is now 5 years old! All the dental assistants to the dentist are so throughout and gentle with my boys. The office does not look like a regular dental office so it puts my kids mind at ease. I also have a three year old and his been coming since he was 1. He is getting familiar with the dental office, assistance and dentist! I recommend this place for any parents that have little ones. Also, Julianna I believe shes a D.A she is very gentle and so caring with my kids!! They love her.< /Review>

They are so sweet with my kids here. My son is 4, my daughter is almost 3 and we have been coming for about 3 years now. Lisa was the sweetest working with my littles today before the dentist came to check everything out. It's a great place to introduce you kids and get them use to going to the dentist.< /Review>

This place is ridiculous,never again will I bring my kids here again,this place overcharged me for my daughter's wisdom tooth,after giving me a written quote, I arrived to get wisdom toothe pulled and they surprised me with price of 148$ more.i was already there so I paid for it .I complained about it and told me that was after ins. Paid. I escalated complaint and got refund , telling me they made mistake.Also seems like everybody points to the next person for responsibility.Than I always make appointments for Saturdays, sometimes I get text for different day.Then they'll tell me I made appointment.I went in there for my youngest child and told me she had cavity, than month later she went in there for cleaning and tell me she doesn't, I guess it disappeared.Seams like every time I ask for dr. Yoseffi he's not there, asked for him to call me back, and I never hear from him, I'm just waiting for my child to finish braces treatment and I'm done with this place.<//Text>

Went here in 2019 based on reviews. I brought in both of the children who I am fostering the front desk copied all paperwork in the children’s  file which allowed them to treat as well as myself and my husband as authorized guardians. Fast forward a few months and a few treatments later.... I was sick and had my husband take the children in..... Surprise!!! Guess what When my husband arrived they discovered they didn’t have the paperwork that stated my husband was allowed to take them to visits and authorize treatments. How could this be? Now their information is out in the trash or who knows where. The staff who performs the treatments are good however,  you can not skip the disaster of a front desk staff they have. They know who I am. If they read this they can contact me. I am yet to hear from the office manager since December.< /text>

<Text>So the long story goes like this, this is in a window of about one month:

Appointment 1: We show up with our boy, and "they don't have us listed" that we are supposed to come in. I explain to them that I scheduled the appt. last week, and they eventually accommodate a quick appointment to see our son, they tell us to come in for the next visit, and that he needs to come in fasting for a procedure. [Strike 1]

Appointment 2: We show up at 1pm for our appointment, and they can't see us again because "the doctor had to go home." Keep in mind the kid hasn't ate all day waiting for this appointment. So I didn't want to, but I scheduled the 3rd appointment anyway because he needs the procedure done. [Strike 3]

Appointment 3: We show up again, and AGAIN "they don't have us listed" because I didn't confirm the appointment (which I DID through text the day before). They scramble to fit us in, only to tell us that the doctor that took our insurance "is no longer there" and they cannot take our insurance anymore. Once again the kid was fasting, which if you are a parent you can understand how difficult that is. [Strike 3 you're out!]

My main problem is this: WHAT KIND OF "PROFESSIONAL" FACILITY are these people running there!? These people are acting like they messed up our food order or something. These are people's lives/schedules you're messing with. We have to plan our days for these visits.

Three appointments scheduled, problems with all three. Needless to say we called our old dentist after this, just have to make a longer drive, but at least there's SERVICE there.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Children’s Happy Teeth is awesome! The entire staff is courteous and professional. I have never had a negative experience with them. My daughters are treated with kindness and respect, I love how they are addressed as individuals. It’s important to me that my daughters are comfortable and confident when they visit the dentist...and this office definitely provides that!< /review><user_id>113605585640238071085<//user_id>< rate>

This place is amazing!
The staff is always kind, professional, and extremely patient!!!
I used to take my kids to a different dentist which would constantly do filling almost every visit!!!! But when since transferring them here, in already 4 visits each, only one of three of them has ever needed a filling! It’s a bit far of a drive for me, but it’s totally worth the drive for my 11, 8, and 2 years to feel safe and comfortable!!
My Issac, Evan, & Avy couldn’t be in better hands!

And FYI, the precautions that they’re currently taking with Covid-19 are amazing!< /text>

Horrible place, they dont want to help financially at all! The last time they almost lost my sons tooth in his mouth during the procedure! And he kept saying his nose was hurting while he was in the chair with the nose medication on and when it was removed it had made a pretty bad indentation. They wont help you during COVID here. I would not take my kids here ever again!</review>

Absolutely horrible experience here. 3 of our 4 appointments cancelled or front office had no idea we had an appointment. Office staff have no idea what they're doing. Very unprofessional! We wasted our time and gas driving over there for our appointments to be cancelled. Will not go back and would not recommend.</Review>

<Text>I have been bringing my daughter here since she was 18 months. She is currently 3. Her experiences here have been the best by far, so much, that my babygirl always looks forward to going and she now says she wants to be a Dentist too.
Juliana is wonderful, she performed my daughter's cleaning very thoroughly. Her patience and level of kindness is beyond exquisite. She took the time to explain everything, the whole process. Step by step what she was going to do, and explaining in detail as she did it. She gave her such a sense of security that she left super happy and with a smile. Looking forward to our next visit.

Thank you for everything! See you in 6 months!<//Text>< resp>

<Text>I had my son Titus Dy had to undergo 4 fillings in one sitting and the staff (Yasmine and another lady with a long dark ponytail that assisted Yasmine) were incredible ! They worked so well together and talked my son through the whole process from how bitter the paste will taste to exactly when they were done with each tooth and they were so very kind and quick at the same time! I was extremely impressed with this team of ladies and they really put my nervous boy at ease** So very grateful!!!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dd2b53689efc6d:0x5cbd475e20fe6c6c<//GmapID></record>

This place has went down since the owner is only around twice a week. They call you to confirm appointments and must get a verbal confirmation or they cancel your appointment, but if you cancel they want to charge you $50. then the wait is 1hour before you are seen, so much for having an appointment. The new dentist are not kid friendly. They treated my son with no pain medication for a filling. He was in so much pain. The assistants don’t even like the new dentist, they roll their eyes. It has definitely went down since I started coming here 6years ago.< /Text>

Today was his appointment I called to confirm and they cancel my appointment because their office number had the wrong number and they couldn't confirm the appointment.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Very un professional.  They wouldnt see my son after emailing texting calling more than 3 times...So  I asked for a referral since they were not acting fast to take him to childre  hospital. They send the referral to a total different office. Thanks to their lack of professionalism I found a much better dentist that worked on my son on the same day..<//review></record>

Horrible Management. Dont waist your time on coming here. Staff has little if none professionalism. Office has nothing entertaining for children and the wait times are way to long. I have been in way better dentist office then this one and those were located in the ghetto. I dont know how an office like this is open in La Mirada. Such a shame and waist of space. I pray this places closes down and/or a new owner or even company moves in because this place is HORRIBLE!! They deserve NO STAR at all !!<//Review>

Just had a horrible experience here, my first visit with my daughter was a great experience she was very cooperative and she was looking forward to her second visit. Second visit came and I was informed in the front desk that I was late 30 minutes, I apologized and told them that it was my mistake but I recalled getting an email that said otherwise. Luckily I was able to show my email that I was not late and I was able to keep my appointment for the day. Then when we were called to go in, I was informed that there was a mistake in my items for my daughter and that instead of my $275 it was going to be $700, by this time I was unsure what kind of an operation this was, my confidence level dropped and I asked to speak with the manager. The manager was so unprofessional and had absolutely no customer service skills and simply said that he was sorry. I am writing this not only to share my experience here but to let you all know that this place doesn’t seem to have the checks and balances in place and for you to double and triple check their work as they simply make mistakes and do not work with you.<//Text>

This orthodontist has been great! They have always been super cool and talking to me and being very personal. Alongside that, my teeth have improved a lot from buck-teeth and over a bad over-bight. Although it has taken a while, my teeth were pretty bad so it is understandable. They were able to compromise on the pricing with my brother and I and we're extremely happy the whole way through. I with definitely recommend this orthodontist.</review>

The waiting room is perfectly set up for kids to feel comfortable and play. It's very clean. The receptionist are very friendly. The dentist are so sweet with the kids and give great direction so that the kids feel comfortable and even down to the payment and insurance stuff Jackie makes it easy to understand. It's really the best place. I drive a hour to get to it because it is worth it!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

After visiting several dental offices I finally came across happy braces. From the very first moment the front desk staff was very friendly and took their time to throughly explain everything in detail and ask me if I had any questions. In comparison to the other dental offices who were just moving people in and out, happy braces made me feel comfortable and the doctor is awesome! The whole staff really knows what they're doing and I'm glad I made the choice to stick with them.< /text>

It used to be good, but recently their whole business attitude has changed. They make you stand at the door when you arrive. They can see you, yet they make you callon the phone before they will even speak to.they tell you if you don't go to your car and call and get away from the door they won't see you. And if they don't see you they charge you $50 for not showing up or being late. And when they do finally see you they try to sell you something for your children that they don't really need.I've gotten second opinions and other dentists have told me they don't really need what children's happy teeth tried to get me to do.the girls at the front desk have an overall bad attitude and seemed like they don't really care they treat you like dirt. I don't recommend that place to anyone!</review>

Happy Teeth is where we ended up for our kid's braces after looking around, checking prices and just seeing what was out there. This was our 2nd kid with braces and having gone to another ortho with the first we were looking for something more reasonable yet still high quality. We found it here. The Dr. was great. The staff was great. The product was great. And, the customer service was excellent. They actually stayed over an hour after their closing time to make my daughter happy. I definitely recommend Happy Teeth.< /review>

<Review>I honestly love this place! Every time I come here I am always greeted with smiles and the friendliest orthodontists ever. Doctor Yusefi is very knowledgeable and clearly explains what needs to be done, why, and how to get you the best deal. The entire office is spotless and a big plus if you have kids is the video games and iPads in the waiting area. Would recommend in fact, already have!<//Review>< response>

<Text>I use to be excited about this place . But today I received the most stupid service by stupid employees.They have more than one location. But yet can’t hire somewhat intelligent staff. Please go elsewhere. Forget about trying to resolve the issue with a magager. They are useless too!</Text>< response>

<Review>Awesome office for kids and great staff. That's what won me over.
EDIT:
After my first visit I liked this place. On my second visit my son went from no cavities to 8 or 9 within a few months. They wanted to do 3 baby route canals on my 3 year old, however they just said they will cap the teeth and it took me 5-10 minutes of questioning to pull out this pulpotemy/ baby route canal out of them. After this they said insurance only pays for silver caps and white is an extra charge. This is $275 per tooth and is a general cap not custom fit. This all happened same day of 1 xray of the front teeth and they tried rushing me to do it all same day.

My red flags went up. Of course I want everything for my child and I feel they are taking advantage of that here. I don't want my son with silver front teeth looking like a pirate. I called my insurance and they cover white teeth for the front only, which they were, but they used the job code. Doing everything all at once is a way to quickly get a sale. At the end of the day it comes down to $$$. Very sketchy and I did not like.

I got a second opinion at a great place in Anaheim hills. My son needs 2 caps not 3 and only has 1 other cavity. Not sure where this place came up with the extra cavities but needless to say I will never be back. Take caution and do not blindly take what they say, get a second opinion. I did and save over $1,000 out of pocket because of their greed.< /Review>< username>

A day before my childs appt(a appt i made in nov) i had called in to confirm it i was placed on hold for ten mins without any info why when the manager came to the line i was informed the dentist wouldn’t be coming in i let him know thats fine my only days off are Tuesdays thats when i can make the appt he offered me was another month out when i was trying to get more info on why it took me calling in for them to tell me they wouldn’t be able to see her he kept cutting me off became rude and unprofessional was pushy for me to set appt for next month. The staff is great and so are the dentists very friendly but for a manager to act the way he did i wont be coming back. He definitely needs training in customer service.< /text>

< Review>
First appt was good, everything perfect until they change Dr. 2nd appt was a mess , i paid 750 dlls co-pay , Dentist was pushing gas valve into my sons mouth , i had to ask her to stop because my son was having difficult to breath. His heart rate went up to 138 per min and Oxigen saturation dropped to 92%, so my son was traumatized, and they decided to stop the process. I feel bad and sad for taking my baby to a really bad experience.<//Review>

The last few times I gave a good review. But one thing I cant stand is bad customer service. Don't lie and tell me you did one thing and didn't do bring other kids in before my kids when I was here before the appointment time and waited an hour to be seen and nothing. This is a waste of my day when I could have been at work making money. This is very unprofessional!</Text>

(Translated by Google) I am a little unsure about how my son would be treated but everything was wonderful Dr. Ann did an excellent job and the assistant Kimberly was very helpful in explaining everything about the procedure and answered all my questions

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend this disgusting place, they want to charge you $ 50 to cancel an appointment for each child, apart from that they are very late to attend you, they are slow for everything, they are profiteers knowing how the citation is.

(Original)
No les recomiendo este asco de lugar te quieren cobrar $50 dólares por cancelar una cita por cada niño, aparte Deque son bien tardados para atenderte son lentos para todo son unos aprovechados sabiendo cómo está la cituacion..< /review>

<review>Ok...so I am not a customer of the car wash but I had a flat tire and I had to get off the interstate. No one else would help me change my flat tire and these two employees went above and beyond to change my tire. If you are the manager/owner please reach out to me. I want to thank the employees for the help! They did not have to. Y'all have great people working for you!< /review>< user_name>

I'll give 3 stars, due to the fact I think they should add more soap and product for the 15 dollar wash. But overall the car came out clean except for some dirty spots on the windshield and bumper. But overall the experience was good, fast car wash, and fast drying from the guys who stand outside at the end.<//review>

Nice car wash, staff are very friendly and they get the job done. So happy they have areas where you can complete the tasks of vacuuming and removing trash from your car.< /text>

<text>Came in because of the good reviews but come to find out if there machine breaks something. They just say sorry they should have told me my car was to low. I've gone to car washes that have told me yes and no but they check. The guy guiding people in kept telling me to go.< /text>< Response>

<resp>None</resp><text>This place used to be so much better. The people that dry the car seem lazy and dont pay attention to what they are doing. Before they were on it not anymore. They never put amor all either and I pay for it. I always have to tell them and they dont dry my chrome wheels.

Leaving very unsatisfied, probably the worst drive through car wash I've ever been to. I still have soap suds left over on my car. Still looks dirty and streaky... As if i didn't get a wash at all. Vacuums could barely pick up a crumb, actually, one side didn't even work, I had to use the person's next to me... I feel so crabby after this car wash from disappointment. Definitely a let down and won't be returning ever again. Some constructive criticism - less soap, and more water! And YES, we are crying for 9$ because it is a waste of money to put that towards EXPECTING a proper wash, and coming out as if someone just threw soap and water on your car and left it to air dry. It's a dud.</text>

The wash is okay but the guys that dry my car afterward are awesome. I have paid more money for much less value.  I just wish they had a quick wash option like they have in AZ.  $3 and it's a quick run through just to get the dust off.< /Text>

Dont get the title wrong "Fast N Furious" its fast and furiously bad... I usually use the competitions express carwash on Foothill.. but i was there and choose to try FNF out. I went with the $9.00 wash and shine and got horrible wash. Not recommended at all, even with 2 employees wiping the car down after the wash i still had all the dead bugs on my windshield. The $5.00 express at the competitions is even better then the $9.00 here...</text>

1st time here, paid for the $9 wash. The blowers didn't even dry my truck off. The wash wasn't that great either, should have done the $6 wash.< /text>

Made everything so simple and secured me quick easy financing since I didnt have all the cash. Was in and out in about an hour and a half. Drove off with a great trailer. Highly recommend.< /Review>< pictures>

“I bought a small trailer last April and I started to notice the “Clear coat coming off on only HALF OF THE TRAILER.”  Which is not normal at all, It couldn’t be the weather because I had it in my storage unit for over 6 months. So I call the office and they tell me that theres nothing they can do i and deny my  warranty claim on???? So I told this local office to give me the corporate number they never got back to me. I end of getting the corporate number and talked to the “WARRANTY DEPARTMENT “ and they said the peeling is normal that it’s call “MILL” THAT THEY HAD MADE UP ONE SIDE OF THE TRAILER WITH THE MILL FACING OUT AND THE OTHER  HALF FACING IN!!!!! THAT SOUNDS LIKE POOR QUALITY CONTROL. NOW IM GETTING MY TRAILER WRAPPED WITH MY BUSINESS LOGO AND THE WRAP COMPANY IS NOT GOING TO GIVE ME A WARRANTY SINCE THE TRAILER IS PEELING!!!! YOU CAN TELL MY THE PICTURES THE TRAILER IS "BRAND NEW!!"</Text>

Our experience with Fresno TrailerPlus deserves at minimum 10 stars!  We showed up a little before our appointment time and were warmly greeted by our salesperson, Logan.  It was 4pm on the Saturday of Easter weekend.  We had narrowed our selection to 2 in-stock trailers. Logan was thorough in pointing out pros and cons of each but we never felt pressured into something we didn't want.  The financial transaction was fairly seamless and store Manager Brandon was extremely patient in helping facilitate the process.  I believe it was past closing by the time we left, yet no one was frustrated in the least (or they didn't show it!).  In comparing various makes of enclosed trailers and other dealerships, we opted for the quality of the Interstate LoadRunner for our specific needs.  Little did we know that we'd receive such great customer support as well.  Great work guys!  Keep up the good job.<//Text>

We had an awesome experience with Trailers Plus purchasing our 7’ X 16’ Victory enclosed trailer!  They have the highest quality trailers I have seen.  Brandon C. was amazing to work with and very knowledgeable about everything!  Would definitely recommend purchasing from them!<//Text>

I urge you to buy elsewhere! Here’s my experience:
My fathers businesses have purchased trailers here before; the last trailer had so many problems- from the floorboard coming up to electrical not working and more! We took it back so many times and they’d “not know” about the other issues until I finally had to make a document with ALL of the problems so ALL could get fixed for once and I had someone there sign for acknowledgement so they couldn’t lie anymore. That was the only way we were taken seriously.
Once this issue was resolved we decided to give another chance and my father attempted to purchase a brand new trailer. My father is using it to move four hours away and he made it well known that he couldn’t personally be there but will send a corporate check with my fiancé. He also tried to pay with debit or credit card over the phone and they declined to allow that. Fine. But Brandon C. said because we had bought before he will take a business check.
My fiancé gets there, signs all kinds of paperwork waits for OVER 2 HOURS until they finally say they can’t take the check. He even already had the trailer hooked up and had to detach it!!!  We had movers waiting and wanting to charge for waiting of course and my fiancé shows up with no trailer for them. Absolutely not okay to do to anyone/ someone who has bought multiple trailers before!
They’ve lost our companies business and our friends, family and employees know to not trust them.< /review>

If you are looking to get a trailer to haul stuff, this is the place to get it done. We got an enclosed cargo trailer 12x6. My wife and I wanted a trailer like this for a long time. As I typed that last line, I realize how silly that sounds, but we have moved all over the country and had wanted something to haul around our things safely and easy to access.
Now, because of COVID and everything else that is going on, we felt like now was the best time to pull the trigger. I called around 1130 am and set an appointment for 4 pm that same day per the company's COVID policy. Trailer-plus asks you to put a $50 deposit down to reserve a trailer you are interested in so that others do not take it. As I was selecting a trailer, it became reserved while I was looking at it and I could not do anything else after looking at it.
I had never bought a cargo trailer before, but I knew some things that I wanted on it. Brandon, the store manager, walked us through what we wanted and gave us ideas for additional options. When we arrived for our 4PM appointment, we asked for some last-minute add-ons just before we took delivery, which the crew did without any issues whatsoever. We hooked up after the sale was final and the crew (three people total) walked us through how to use the trailer and made sure that the lights worked. All of them were friendly and knowledgeable; even the guy that had only been there for three weeks. In the end, we had felt we had made the right choice based on the convenience, service, and price of our trailer. We drove away smiling and excited for our next moving adventure...yeah... with everything that is going on, the little things count for a lot more than they used to. Stay safe out there.<//Review>

In short, I am seeking over $4,000 in damages from this company.
From a business owner of multiple trailer purchases from here, dont waste you time and money at Trailers Plus.
I reluctantly gave them another try today. Yesterday I got a quote and set up an appointment. I was promised by the manager Brandon Clark that they would accept my corporate check because of my repeat business. I tried to pay by debit card, but they would not take it over the phone. I was going to send cash, but a check purchase was confirmed.
I sent my son-in-law 3-½ hours down there to get the trailer. He arrived on time at the 9:30 appointment. I told Brandon yesterday time was very important and the trailer needed to be ready. After TWO  hours of time wasted, the trailer hooked up to the truck, and all the paperwork signed, they decided they could not take the corporate check.
Yesterday, I paid 4 times as much by check to John Sullivan Chevrolet for a new truck, of which I have never bought from them before.  No Problem. But this POS Trailers Plus, where I have bought multiple trailers, could not take a corporate check for $11,000.
This trailer was for my kids to move into their first home purchase.
I had to hire a mover on an emergency basis to remove the furniture from my house that closes escrow in 3 days.
Brandon Clark and Trailers Plus just cost me over $4,000 in labor and expenses because of their mlies and fraudulent ways to sell trailers.  When I told Brandon that I will seek legal reimbursement for my expenses he replied, “I dont know what I did wrong.”
They cant even comprehend when they have wasted your time and money.<//Text>

<Review>If I could I would give no stars. We talked to the new assistant manager for 2 hours. He said he would negotiate a price for us and after waiting so long they called their "boss" and he did not go down at all on the price. We were told by the new assistant manager that we would be able to negotiate a price and after all the hassle we went through the "boss" would not go down on the price. We had cash in hand ready to make a deal and do business. You should never tell a customer "Becasue you are paying with cash and you have waited along time we will negotiate a price."  There was no negotiation when the boss said I'm not going down at all. Trailers plus is a joke. Don't  waste your time coming here and please don't give your hard earned money to help them stay in business. Lies, lies, and more lies. Where are all the honest people. We are definitely going to do business somewhere else.< /Review></record>

If I could give NO STARS I would. We purchased a 24 foot trailer from you 2 years ago. When we only had the trailer a few weeks we had a blow out with nothing in the trailer. We had problems getting a new one because they said we had to of ran something over and we had to go through the tire company. We have already gone through 3 of the tires. None of the tires that were sold with the trailer are any good including the new one that was sent to us. When you buy a trailer you would expect good tires I guess that's not a good selling point for trailers plus. I would not recommend buying a trailer from trailers plus.< /text>

Cant comment on trailer quality as I didn't get that far. The trailer I bought from a private party later that day however is awesome , and way more heavy duty than what I could see TrailersPlus had in stock.<//text>< pics>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>We had been looking for a trailer at another location near our home in Morgan Hill but it was sold the day before we could come back.  I looked online and found TrailersPlus Fresno had the same trailer at a slightly lower price!  We were treated great and came away with just what we wanted.  Michael was an excellent salesman and would definitely go to Fresno again if we need another trailer.</Text><Date>1469592076383</Date>< rating>

<text>On a bit of a whim, my husband and I bought a 6.4x12 utility trailer here today. The service was prompt and friendly and the conversation was even better. It took a bit longer than we imagined it would but it was definitely time and money well spent. Everyone was so pleasant that if I found myself in the neighborhood I'd even stop in just to say hi. Thanks for everything guys and an extra thumbs up to Mike.
Dear owners, get a water or soda machine or at least a water fountain already! That asphalt jungle you're in gets hot as blazes and a person gets awfully parched in a hurry. =/ Also, I looked on Yelp to review you there  but couldn't find you. Yelp is so much better than Google reviews. You should fix that. Trust. Thanks for the thumbs up on our very satisfactory package deal. When we want an upgrade one day, we'll come see you.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><username>Whoopsy Daisy<//username></record>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Instant approval because they create you a  DBA and file paperwork as a commercial business. They will preach to you and say its completely legal which it is if you're an existing business, and of course there are fees behind that. Then they will not take back the equipment because it becomes used at that point. Equipment quality...the welds...not the best workmanship I've seen.It's more of a quantity over quality work. Also little add ons you'll be charged for them just because 'It's to hot to remove it".
Finally the customer service is a complete joke, I cancelled a reservation after I waited for an hour before being acknowledged was told it would be taken care of then, I get a phone call an hour later asking if i was still coming in for our appointment. If you receive a voicemail saying "We have great news" lol it's a lie they just want you to call them back.  Last time I go back to them</review>< resp>

<Text>After 1 year my car hauler I purchased here new is already falling apart. Tried out trailers plus on this purchase since Tru trailers lead time was a little long. I should have waited. All my trailer tires after very low use in one year are worn horribly. I do not think the axles are aligned correctly. The deck started coming up after the 3rd time pulling the race car on it. Wiring was just twisted wires with electrical tape which I found out when my brakes weren't even working due to poor connectivity. Meanwhile the 2nd axle wasn't even wired to start. The ramps don't stow away after a year as they are supposed to... One failed and dropped ramp while towing which luckily didn't hit a car. But I brought it back and first they said I overloaded it. Which I didnt. Now they say it was UNDERLOADED? Well they still have it. I'll update the post on what they do and if they make it right. Or at least upload pics when I get around to picking up my one year old .

The employees seem really cool and nice. Just bad trailers and company does not stand behind them this far.< /Text>< Resp>

Walked by this spot a few times before finally stopping in, and I can see why there is always a huge lunch crowd here! This no-frills hot dog counter serves up a wonderful dog! I always forget how much I like a good hot dog, and I'm so thankful that I found Jimbo's to remind me! The owner was very nice and quick to help me. He just celebrated his 30th anniversary of business, and I see why he's been around so long. Top quality lunch on the cheap, I got a hot link with cheese the way I wanted it for less than $5! A new favorite lunch spot!</Text>

I discovered Jimbo's Hot Dogs after they were reviewed in the local paper.
I was thrilled with the quality of their hot dogs.
The staff was very nice and professional.
Willing to answer all of my questions.
The menu is pretty simple and straightforward.
All the usual hot dog toppings.
Plus they have hot links and sausages.
A great little place.
I will definitely be back.</Review>

Best lunch place in Marin for an old time welcome, great dogs at a perfect price, and surprisingly good roast beef, turkey and pastrami sandwiches - don't miss the potato salad too. Lunch here clears away the worries from the office, at least for 30 minutes.<//Review>

I had my first Jimbo's hot dog in 1982. I left the Bay Area in 1987, returned to the East Bay in 1996, and FINALLY got back to Jimbo's in 2016, since I now work in Marin again as I did in 1982. The best! I am going today. They only take cash, so be prepared!</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Jimbos is a local secret. Me and my buddies cone here AT LEAST twice a week on our lunch break. The regular hotdog (Jimbo dog) is probably the best hotdog I've ever had. I know that doesnt sound like much, but don't knock it until you try it! The Polish dog is to die for and the Hot links are actually spicy! There are a variety of toppings and they will make your dog EXACTLY how you want it. Super friendly staff that always remembers your name. Definitly worth checking out if you haven't!<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Review>I've been going there for some time now, and I thought it was high time I shared  my humble opinion....JIMBO'S HOT DOG RESTAURANT is simply the perfect place to get a hot dog or other sandwich anywhere in the area ...all the meats, buns, condiments, and extras are prepared to perfection...even the drinks are as cold as you can find...if you've never been there.  GO!!!.....BONUS: The price is right...</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Super hot dog! Perfect for a quick lunch, the service is quick and inexpensive. The owner is very welcoming and the sandwiches are delicious.

Super hot dog ! Parfait pour un déjeuner sur le pouce, le service est rapide et bon marché. Le propriétaire est très accueillant et les sandwichs sont délicieux.< /Review>

Scam. They charge you for a consultation - $85 -that is never mentioned on website. (It's nothing more than a sales pitch on a piece of paper.) They overcharge for vaccines that you can get elsewhere. They also have a rude and foul mouthed "nurse" working at their Oakland location.

You can do much better at clinics in SF. I travel all the time.

BTW, they have responded to my review with a lie (see below). The $85 fee is not mentioned when you book. The only thing mentioned is a $75 fee if you don't show up. I showed up and was charged $85. I have contacted my credit card company to reverse charges, which I never do, except if their is fraud.</text>

Had an appointment with Keisha (travel nurse expert)  this week who thoroughly explained the Yellow Fever vaccine program as well as all the recommended vaccines we should consider for our trips to the Philippines, South Africa, and Zambia.  She also gave excellent advice on the food and water risks as well as mosquito repellent management.   It was an excellent and informative consultation and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeking out their expertise before traveling abroad.</review>

I expected my appointment to be quick and impersonal, but it was the opposite.  The nurse was thorough with my personalized itinerary, asking me detailed questions, and making sure I understood everything she was telling me.  I had an additional question about a separate vaccine that was unrelated to my travels, and she took the time to research the answers to my questions and then provided it for me.  This was the best vaccination experience I've had, and I would highly recommend it to everyone.  Although it was expensive, there is no price for health and peace of mind.< /review>

<Review>I highly recommend this clinic. I recently visited the clinic to get vaccinated for my upcoming move to Nigeria. It was very easy to schedule an appointment and they were very professional and accommodating. Erica is extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer all my questions about the vaccines I was getting. I received a travel book with all the important health info I need to know about Nigeria. Erica has the most amazing light hand! I barely felt the vaccines. I, like many people, don't enjoy getting vaccinated but Erica made the experience so pleasant. I would definitely go back to this clinic.</Review><userid>118052551038986651786< /userid>< gmap_id>

My appointment with Erica was very good. She had prepared a booklet in advance with information tailored to my upcoming travel destinations, and we discussed the various options for immunizations. I found her to be very personable, well informed, and easy to talk with, and I didn't feel pressured to do anything that I didn't feel comfortable with. The entire process was quick and painless. I would definitely recommend using this clinic. My only suggestion would be that the company website show the price list for their services, so that patients would know what to expect in terms of cost before they show up at the clinic.< /review>

<Review>We have been to several travel clinics over the past few years and this was by far the best! When we arrived, they had our entire itinerary mapped out and ready for us with a detailed plan of what we needed for each city we were going to in Colombia. We got great recommendations for all the ways to prevent any unpleasant thing you could imagine. Plus - they are one of the only places in California where you can get the Yellow Fever vaccine right now. Highly recommend!</Review>< rate>

Scientists on a limited budget for required research trips will probably never be totally happy to fork over hundreds of dollars for pricey vaccines, but my travel nurse Eileen made the brief visit to Passport Health a completely worthwhile part of my travel preparations! I cannot emphasize enough how valuable it was for me to have received such extensive and personalized advice from someone so knowledgeable about all things public health. However, besides her professional and informative assistance, what really demonstrated Eileen's passion for what she does was her congenial attitude, her eagerness to customize service to my needs, and her concern for every aspect of my overall well-being as an international researcher. Any Passport Health client who gets the opportunity to receive assistance from Eileen should have lots to look forward to.<//Text>

This place is great!  There were able to see me within a day of my call, which was critical because I needed a shot to travel for work.  They were one of the very few if only places that had the vaccine I was looking for and the nurse who saw me - Erica H - was professional, helpful and skilled (the shot did not even hurt!).  All in all a great experience.<//Text>

I saw Erica, and she was great! Went over all the recommended vaccinations for my trip, and helped me figure out which were necessary for the parts I'd be traveling in. The overall price was reasonable for the 5 vaccinations I received. The whole experience was quick and (relatively) painless!< /Text>

I realized almost last minute that I needed a vaccine and it was one that turned out to be in short supply, but it was super easy to work out with Passport Health. Stacy at the Oakland Travel Clinic gave me a good run down of the health and hazard conditions in the countries I'm traveling to with excellent advice for trip planning. I highly recommend the Passport Health Oakland Travel Clinic!</text>

Erica was AMAZING - she / the team took time to highlight everything I needed for my destinations in a notebook, and they were able to add in vaccines I hadnt considered at the last minute. I was also terrified of getting my shots and she was very gentle, fast and accommodating of my fears.

Note that there is no signage for Passport Health outside of the building so its a little confusing but the Google maps location is correct.</Text>

< Review>
I brought my son here today for the Yellow Fever vaccine.  We saw Stacy, who was so friendly and explained everything to my son and me.  My son had been a bit anxious about getting a shot, and she distracted him so well he didn't even realize she was already done.  I would definitely recommend this clinic to anyone in need of vaccines or health services before travelling.<//Review>

I had only wanted one and there no hard sell at all. I 'hate' getting shots, I don't look, and this one was painless, to the point where I actually wanted to question if I really did get a shot at all. Would absolutely go back if needed and would definitely recommend< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Nurse Stacy was the best. She has a great personality. She worked with my three kids and make them feel comfortable.  My 15 teenager hates needles. Stacy worked with her anxiety and coached her through a stressful situation. And...btw...all of us hardly knew we had received our vaccinations...she is the BEST at delivering shots.  Thank you Stacy!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I arrived at the Oakland facility earlier than scheduled. Stacy Bullock was extremely courteous, attended to me right away, went over the paperwork very efficiently and gave me the yellow fever vaccination. I was in and out in 20 minutes. Net net, a very positive experience and far exceeded my expectations.<//review>

<Text>Stacy was great!  She explained the shot I was getting, we filled out paperwork, I got the shot and was off.  Pleasant and quick as well as fortunate to get the shot.  The other doctors offices I tried didn't have any of the vaccination.< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x808f85bebda0750f:0x6169e277abfd3291<//Gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp><Name>robin alvarado</Name>< time>

I met with Erica last week, she had everything organized to go over where I was headed on my trip.  Had a list of recommendations for each country.  I never felt the shot I got :).  Had the other medications in stock.
Actually cares about the customer and there well being.< /Text>

This morning I was having a less than pleasant morning. After running late to my appt (AND receiving a highway patrol citation while going to my appt), I was frazzled and frustrated as I entered Passport Health. Insert Erica. Upon my disheveled and sweaty arrival, she was welcoming and kind to me, and was extremely prepared for my consult. She helped me decide exactly what vaccinations I would need and recommended the best products and practices for my upcoming trip. I highly recommend her! She made my morning much better and was thorough and patient through my indecisiveness during our consult. If you’re reading this and got this far, I’m sure you’re not having as rough of a day and are not as difficult of a patient as I was, so you’ll have an even better experience. She’s great. See her.< /text>

We had the best experience here! Raffi was so helpful in finding us the perfect wedding bands! We were in a pinch of time and all other jewelers told us it was impossible to find a ring in time. Raffi made it possible and we are so grateful!!<//review>

I originally went into the store because my husband was sent via mail a card that he would receive free diamond stud earrings for his birthday. When we got to the store they want us to buy jewelry (which we did), but they said they did not have the diamond stud earrings. I hope this isn’t false advertisement because I dislike liars. I will call this office to follow up if they’ve received the diamond stud earrings my husband was told they were free to him to go into the store...I will follow up, stay tuned....</Review>

We bought two rings white gold with 1/2 k diamond
I paid 1950.00$ for that ring
After 3 months the color of the ring came out to yellow gold and not white gold.
I know there is not a white gold and the yellow gold is mixed with other materials to make it white,
But then when I came to the shop they told me it was plated with other materials PLATED. To make it shine.
It’s not acceptable. You should told me that when I bought it from the beginning.
My wife have rings and earring and necklaces with white gold for over 15 years and the color never came out when she wearing it on daily basis.
That means the materials you use is the cheapest one.
I ask to replace it to something else as yellow gold and they didn’t want to .
I’ll never step at that shop again.</text>

First they persuade you in to buying jewelry and on top of that ; they make you believe they’ll accept returns . When I took one of the six items I had purchased , then they said all sales are finals . Even after I’ve explained to them that I had just lost my job!!! It is false advertisement what they do . It is very expensive. And look in to their policies first before purchasing. They gave me the run around and they hadn’t even bother in contacting me to see how they can help . not only that but they gave me the wrong email address so nobody would reply to me . Worse customer aerobics ever !!!! I had never known of a company that because they don’t want to deal with printing and creating more paperwork because is too much trouble for them and they don’t want to deal with it and with you anymore of course after you spent your time in their store !!! Making them not only money more revenue for their company.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c29b0b3063c7f9:0xf97e8eb617f1c108< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

Great looking store with more options than anyone else.
And that’s not all, Seta helped me pick a beautiful ring for my wife with the best attitude and the biggest smile in the whole Mall.
Thank you!< /text>

<review>I walked in the store and was immediately welcomed. A card came in the mail for free earrings for my birthday and it was true.  They were free.  No purchase required.  Attached to the card was a $50 gift card with no minimum to buy.  This was such a sweet offer.  In the end I purchased a ring.  I am very satisfied with my purchase and will be back.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Service was great friendly fast and to the point! A big FLAW with jewelry stores is there inventory does not match what is on line! This is not rocket science, this industry needs to get it together,the first company that does,will certainly do ALLOT more business. This type of purchase is an emotional one the majority of the time,and busy professional want to shop on line BUY,then go in and get it,not wait 2 weeks!< /Text>

*****EDITED REVIEW ******
I got My ring About a Year Ago And Today Is My 3rd Time Dropping it Off To Get one of the small Diamonds Replace. I wear It regular Like Any Other Engagement Ring should be worn. It make Me Wonder If The Diamond Are Just Glued On Or What? If I’m paying over $3k dollars on a Ring It shouldn’t Be This Cheap.  I am Disappointed That I have to drop it off so Often. I guess The Good thing About it is That I got Life time Warranty. I don’t Know If I recommend Kevin’s Jewelry.</Text>< pictures>

I went to Kevin’s Jewelers to pay off my balance and walked out of there getting the greatest deal of the year! I bought 2 Xmas presents plus 2 items for myself. The  best sales woman in Northridge is Natalie Vazquez she not only used the coupons I had she also gave me a free 2 day vacation in Vegas, without No down payment. I walked out of Kevin’s Jewelers very happy and I owe it to Ms.Natalie Vazquez for having such great customer service. I also want to thank the older man there, we had such a great conversation while Natalie got me the best deal!😃Kevin ‘s Jewelers Rock!</Text>

Words can't even describe the treatment that I received when I walked in at the Kevin Jewelers at the Northridge Mall. Very pleasant staff. The knowledge that Elizabeth had made me seem that she has been there for years just to find out that she just started. Even Raffi I guess he was the manager based on his expertise on getting me financed and worked with my down payment. I would recognize and acknowledge the whole staff but unfortunately I didn't get their names but a job well done to the whole staff.< /Text>

Thanks for being an excellent sales representative Susan.

In addition thanks to the owner as he was kind enough to allow me to utilized him as my model (I bought a ring for my husband and needed to see it on a gentleman's finger)

Plus prices are fantastic.
I even bought an inexpensive lifetime warranty.

Editing it since today April 18th 2019 I went back & Tammy was excellent as well on the new purchase of my 2 tone necklace.
Great people here in this Northdridge Kevin Jewelry.<//text>

What can I say, it's a liquor store. They carry all of you run of the mill liquors and even a few not so popular ones. They staff was friendly and helpful and ensured the safety of their patrons by utilizing a plexiglass shield and ensuring their customers wear face mask. Besides booze they also carry snacks, junk food, lottery tickets, and sodas. The end</Text>

I've given this store too many chances. The first time was three years ago I was $0.05 short and I told the guy would run to the scar and get his $0.05 and he berated me. The next time was three weeks ago and the guy accused me of stealing. Will never go back here again even if it's the last store in East Oakland< /review>

Let me start by saying Felix was AMAZING and seriously went above and beyond to meet my storage needs when I had already given up. He pushed beyond and made it happen! As a business owner with urgent needs I can confidently say you can trust their business!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>This is the Rolls Royce of storage facilities. Clean, efficient, temp controlled, gated and safe, and run beautifully by the competent and caring office staff. Patty and Felix are terrific office managers. I can’t begin to express their concern and patience in seeing me through dealing with my son’s storage unit. His death was sudden and tragic, and yet Patty’s sincere concern for me as an emotionally & physically exhausted senior citizen trying to cram my son’s remainder items into a mid-sized SUV (she kept checking on me to make sure I was okay), when it came time to finally close out his account, her  kindness meant so much to me!  You may pay a bit more for Storquest Anaheim, but you will not regret it.<//review>< pics>

First and only storage I will ever pay for. The process was quick and easy. The staff is incredibly helpful. The prices are competitive and one of the staff, Felix has gone beyond being helpful he notified of all the remaining deals they had and I ended up upgrading to the larger 10x14 unit. Overall I would say with the double code entrances (gate) and (main sliding door). Also the climate controlled storage there is no storage that can compete with their quality of customer service and everything that comes with it. To the staff I met Patty, Markus, and my man Felix finding the right fit for you will be easy and safe, THANK YOU GUYS!!!!</Text>

I am writing this review for my mom, so I’m going to say exactly what she told me.
I’m so happy to see Patty’s back, I missed her and what she brings to this establishment. I been here for over a year and love how clean it always is and how safe it makes me feel.
Thank you for all that you guys do. Keep it up!!!<//text>

5/5 Stars, this is the best storage facility I have ever come across. The price is great for what they offer, and after looking for hours for a reliable, secure self-storage. I walked into the office and was formally greeted by the manager, Felix. He was great at answering my questions, and made me feel welcome. By far the best in the business.</review>

Super clean storage facility. The staff was friendly and helpful.  Wasn't in the storage very long but never had any issues. They have alot of cameras so I was able to sleep at night knowing all my stuff was safe. Will definitely use them again when needed.< /Text>

StorQuest in Anaheim is an AMAZING company. They have great rates and a very clean facility. I have never had an issue with them and their customer service is impeccable. Thank you do being so professional and thank you for serving the community during the pandemic. If I ever need a storage unit again, I will not hesitate to reach out. Thank you! ✨✨✨✨✨</text>

<Text>I would have never expected this level of service from a storage facility! Even just from the inquiry/quote stage- quick responses via e-mail, courtesy shown in store, cleanliness of the location... all top notch. Felix showed us around and explained everything our first visit and Martin welcomed us to solidify the agreement. Super impressed and know we chose the right facility. Thanks for keeping a safe, clean spot for all our stuff!
Highly recommend- don't bother with anywhere else.<//Text></record>

My experience with Magali at the Anaheim location was beyond amazing.  She not helped me get the space I needed to store my RV but went above and beyond to help me in any way I needed.  She was kind .. understanding and response time for emails was within  minutes.  If I have to store my RV again in the future I would highly recommend Store Quest in Anaheim.  I can’t thank Magali enough and appreciate all her efforts in helping me.

<text>Absolutely the best storage facility that I have ever rented from.  Staff is friendly, professional and  understanding.  The rules are common sense and reasonable. The facility itself is new, climate controlled,  well lit and all units are inside. The elevators are big and the carts are available the same hours as the gate. They also have 8 to 10?carts so usually they are available without having to wait and they do not require you to leave your keys or driver's license to use the carts. The unload is area is well lit and the lanes are long and wide so unloading is easy.
Martin is absolutely the best,  professional  and empathetic.  If you have any issues, he will try to work with you to find a solution.  The only thing that would make it more perfect would be extending the gate hours,  as it is,  the gate hours of 6am to 8pm are longer than most storage facilities in this area. They also have gate access on holidays. The office may be gone, but you still have access to your unit.
One last thing  to mention, the price for all of these great features is co.peower than other facilities< /text>< pics>

The staff is extremely nice. I had a great time I got a good deal. There's an elevator ac building key code clean new place. No traffic. Moving stuff in soon. Place is lit with cams . They have good insurance. I don't think there's a better place than here. It pretty cool walking in there it's like state of the art. I got a huge storage area for a real good deal. It's like 150 a month for a huge place there's an elevator so the floors don't matter. They have free carts to roll your stuff. Multiple entrances and big loading dock. Very private place. I'm glad my stuff's there. It makes storing stuff exciting.< /review>

I HATE moving, like everyone else, but with that being said, I have two units here. Yes two units. Lol. I got my first unit over a year ago. The staff here are Amazing!! I love Pati!! If you need anything, they are always there with a smile, and bend over backwards to help. When I had to get the 2nd unit, they tried their hardest to make sure it was near the other one, on the same floor. Now unfortunately I have to move out of state, so I won’t be using them anymore. But I STRONGLY suggest you use them. They really are Great! The place is ALWAYS clean, the carts are organized every time I’ve gone in there. They are a step above the competition!! I will miss the staff here, I truly can not say enough nice things about them. Thank you StorQuest</text>

< Review>
My wife and I love StorQuest. Patti gave us the grand tour and we were very impressed by her professionalism and the facility itself. Patti thorougy explained the leasing terms and was careful to disclose all the important in and outs.

After discussing our options, we decided the price was right and  that our property would be kept safe, so we decided to sign up right then and there.

This facility is fairly new - it's very clean, temperature controlled, secure, and close to home. It's everything we want in a storage facility and we think you'll love it, too!< /Review>

I had rented my storage unit almost two years ago and decided on Storquest on Walnut street in Anaheim.. I've rented plenty of storage units throughout the years. This company has the cleanest, well kept storage facility I've ever rented and it has been that way from day one.
I moved out of the unit July 7th 2020. I had left some things in there for a friend to pick up. before the 26th of July 2020. My friend couldn't make it due to health reasons, he was hospitalized. With me now living 500 miles away I was frantic as to how I was going to navigate  the move of my items left in my storage unit! Here comes Patti the assistant manager there to the rescue. I placed a call to her on Friday and shared with her my dilemma.  She assured me that between her and the manager we would figure something out by the following Monday, July 27th, and not to stress about it and to enjoy the weekend. By the time I followed up with Patti on Monday, Patti had taken care of EVERYTHING! She sent me my paperwork letting me know that the unit was cleaned out and that I have a zero balance owing..
Patti has gone above and beyond customer service!  Thank you Storquest of Anaheim..
Thank you Patti, you guys rock!!!!

<review>Great place to do business. They solve problems. In my case, I made an appointment for the next day, but their office A/C was on the fritz, so Megali (I believe she's the Manager) telecommuted  from the air conditioned comfort of her car (in their parking lot) waiting for me to show up for my appointment.  The place was great, air-conditioned, conveniently located (right off the Lincoln exit in Anaheim). I definitely recommend this location. Megali was a great audience for my stupid jokes. Ask for her.
BTW ... their office A/C was only down on the day of my appointment. Megali's future customers may expect 70 degree comfort.
Oh ya. Warning. Be out of there by 8PM. Megali told me about this little detail, but I forgot. Fortunately, I was able to contact her, whereupon she told me the code for "escaping" from the gated premises. Again, a problem solver. Call them.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

After previously using a competitor's storage unit right down the street, switching to StorQuest was like a breath of fresh air. The storage units are clean, well lit, and affordable. The building has reasonable hours for access and the staff are always friendly. Utility carts are available on the first level to help with unloading and moving bulky objects. I highly recommend StorQuest to others who are are considering a storage unit. Of the several different self storage companies I have used, StorQuest is far and away the best that I have encountered.<//Text>

<UserId.>111557131120819189596< /UserId.><Review>Moving is easy and fun, said no one ever. We are 100% in that majority camp. With that said, Magali from StorQuest-Anaheim/Walnut was the highlight of our entire moving process.

I would go out on a limb to say that our experience with finding a new home, and subsequently moving, during a global pandemic was far from conventional. We were moving from DTLA to Anaheim and in the time of Covid, we were glad to make the normally 50-60 minute drive in half the time. Naturally, our luck ran out the weekend of our move when SoCal's economies reopened and it seemed like every car in LA/OC were on the streets and freeways at the same time. Being in bumper-to-bumper traffic usually sucks, but is exacerbated when driving a 15' U-Haul truck.

So we crawled to Anaheim, with me frantically on the phone with Magali half an hour before the office closed for us to rent our storage unit. She and I exchanged phone calls 3 times, with her on the other line being ever-so-patient, empathetic of the situation and willing to help the entire time. Although the storage unit was about to close, she was on the phone with her manager to try and accommodate us. Luckily, the manager was understanding and flexible, and allowed Magali to service us after working hours. Over the phone, she jumpstarted our application process so that all we had to do when we got to the office was pay and sign our lease. We realize that this is absolutely an exception, but in an unprecedented time, we all are experiencing our share of firsts.

When we got into the parking lot, I jumped out of the truck and ran into the office, where Magali was waiting for me. She was a sweetheart, and even more personable in person. 10 minutes later, we were starting to load up our storage unit.

The storage facility is new, clean and well-maintained, as was our unit. Access to the facility is open until 8PM (for those on the autopay plan), and when the gate closes. Our experience at StorQuest has been exceptional and exceeded our expectations, thanks to Magali! :)<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dd29d7797567cf:0x4ce3c2dd2c8b7b05< /gmap_id>< Rating>

<text>Awesome staff, awesome price which lead to awesome experience! I feel horrible not remembering the very courteous and professional long haired gentleman’s name who seems to go out of his way to not only give great service but remember every customer’s name. (I’m so bad with names, sorry!)
The place is new so it is very clean. There is nothing I can say that is negative about this place and their awesome staff! (Sorry if there are more than one, as far as I’ve seen, there is only one staff)

<text>Thoughts/Experience - My 1st time in my life getting a storage and I can honestly say it was a great experience through & through.

Employee's -  Patty was one day early with her call to remind me of my reservation and was pleasing on the phone message she left. Martin was cordial in the process in showing me & answering all my questions. Only mistake I'd say is I bought the wrong lock because I miss interpret which circle lock to buy. Just buy the lock they have there. Otherwise the workers there will help you in every way if you have skepticism.

Facility - The place itself is new so everything is so fresh & so clean. And I know it will continue to be that way because of rules & I notice employees picking up and cleaning. So it won't be trashy facility. As for storage I got a 7X12 for about 95 a month with included insurance so it fills my needs. So I'm gonna stop here and say just got get one already!!!</text></record></dataset><record>

Martin is amazing in helping us and showing us around. When we hit a bump, he made sure we had a storage place still when we lost the first house. The only thing that wasn't their fault was other people bringing in stuff that carried bugs. They spray monthly so its not something to worry about. Sometimes there wouldn't be enough carts around because they are being used by people moving in and out. Would store stuff again if needed.<//Text>

I just arranged a storage unit at StorQuest Self Storage location at 500 S. Walnut Street in the city of Anaheim, Ca and I had Anna assisting me.  Anna made it a very smooth process and was very friendly at all times on the couple of times I was there inquiring with the 2nd time bringing my nephew to check the unit space. Thank you Anna for making the process so easy for me and with no doubt, I will highly recommend your storage facility to my family and friends. Definitely a 5 Start rating in my opinion.< /review>

I am in the process of moving because I am about to deploy, came to Self Storage and was instantly greeted and welcomed by a woman named Jackie. With this being my first move, I was unsure of what to do and how I go about renting out a unit but Jackie made the process that much better with her excellent customer service and sharp knowledge! She explained to me the different sizes in regards to how much stuff I was putting in there, went over pricing and finally helped me select the exact unit I needed! If it wasn’t for Jackie’s outstanding attitude and willingness to help me, I’d be lost! On behalf of the United States Navy, we want to thank and congratulate Jackie on a job well done!</Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Great facility & extremely clean. I had an issue with getting my hours extended since I was selling some of my items with someone on Craigslist. The buyer was mot sure when her husband could come and we were both pressed for time to leave. There was only an early or night extension to choose from. Luckily, Pati, the representative there, saw the frustration on our faces and gladly gave the extension for both! She helped us out a lot and included it for 2 days as well.  Unbeknownst to them though, the code the next morning did not work, fortunately, their phone # worked and after only a few automated questions, I got in contact with a live rep. They assisted me with the error, quickly gave me a new number and the problem was solved!

Although the service at the actual location and the lady over the phone were great... the system online for choosing a rate is a bait & switch. When I initially called and spoke with a sales rep, I was given a “final price” quote of $45. I had made sure that was all it was since I had already priced out other places and they person over the phone confirmed it was. Well long behold, it was not. After taxes&fees it was $90! Literally double. It was the end of the day and I was forced to pay it. Everything else was closed after that and mind you, I was driving a Uhaul rental and I was not gona pay another day. Straight Bull—— ! But whatever you live and you learn. Make sure that when they quote you a “final price” over the phone that they actually added the “taxes & fees”! lol

Overall pretty good experience except for the initial.</review>< Gmap_id>

I searched far and wide to find a storage unit that was clean and reasonably priced, my search ended at Storquest.  I found a nice 20 x 10 space for a good price, the space was exceptionally clean and easy to access with the freight elevator.  The front desk guy was very helpful and friendly.  Overall a five star experience!</text>

Storquest is great! I seemed to have gotten in at the right time (for a reduced rate) although i hear prices here are now leveling out a bit. Could still be slightly under market rate.

Martin the manager here is super friendly and accommodating. This location is brand new and CLEAN. The inside of the place is air conditioned so your stuff won’t get overheated!

I was excited when I saw this place was under construction. Now it’s open and ready for move in. I went by for a visit and Martin was super helpful explaining the different size units and special move in offers. I ended up getting renting a unit and I cannot wait to move stuff into the unit to free up some much needed space at home.

This is a brand new facility, check it out. You will not be disappointed!</Text>

<Review>Martin got me set up when I walked in and he was super helpful and friendly. I’m glad I found this storage unit because it’s close to my place and the facility is very new and clean.

My first day at StorQuest was super! Martin & Manny were so considerate & helped me with all my matters.
I immediately recommended your facility to my nice neighbors Rocky & Vicki, & I’ll continue telling my friends about StorQuest...
One more thing!  I have another storage in Anaheim, & you beat the price of that one.  I plan on soon moving my items to StorQuest...
I’m a very “happy” 😊 customer!
Thank You< /Review>

The staff have all been amazing and the place is clean and well lit. Love the access to dollies to help load out stuff, makes for less trips. We have a bigger and cleaner unit for almost the same amount from where we were. Glad we found this place. Great special too.< /Text>

I just Rented a space at this facility and I was very happy with my customer service. Pati was very helpful in showing me around the facility and went over all the requirements. I would definitely recommend renting a unit here and i would recommend asking for Pati. The place is very new and well kept. I left feeling very satisfied with my experience.</review>

Out of all the storage places I have ever rented from, nothing will ever beat the prices, the quality of the facility and unit, and the service that you are provided with. Martin was very prompt on setting me up with a unit and was very helpful throughout the whole process. Finally, a facility I can rely on.< /Text>

I wasn’t sure what size I would need and Martin was happy to show me a few different ones so I could make the right decision. Once I decided the process was quick and I was out in no time.

Dude asked me to write a review. So here you go.

First day here at the storage units and one of the elevators is broken down. One of the ONLY two elevators they have here for the entire building. It was a bit crowded but everybody was being friendly and helpful to each other.

You would think at some point while elevator number one was broken they would’ve called the service to come and fix the thing. They didn’t. Then  the second elevator breaks down. So while I have some free time I’m writing your review.

And for kicks they don’t even have access to the stairs so we can’t even get up there mianially. So we stuck here in the rain with nowhere to store our stuff. And it’s raining. Thanks guys<//review>

SO, this place is Awesome! overall here’s a quick breakdown of REAL pros cons:

PROS: brand new facility amazing and climate controlled! Quality stuff.
- security 24/7 cameras all over
- gated and very well lit
- actual units are easy to get to and everything fits well.
- CHRIS is the man to go to!

CONS: Admin and lock fee. / 45$
- No bathroom access after 6pm when lobby closes. ( should let us in if we have our code!) offer bathroom to paying clients
- Basic insurance / 10$ a month not included. Some places include this, they do NOT.
- Access code is 9 digits long! Wayyy too long’ drop it to 4-5 digits please. We are way too busy to be inputting the code a million times or remembering it along with all our other CODES for phone bank etc.
- SIZES of ALL units are rounded UP! about 2feet smaller than what’s listed.All the ones I checked measured less than listed for the price.
- Most places offer a free truck to use locally to move your stuff. This place does NOT. They should have a truck with thier logo! This way they are being promoted as we use the truck. WIN WIN! 🤓</text>

Pati, is amazing. She was so helpful and nice to me when I can to get a new storage unit. We were laughing the whole time. She also knew what she was doing, and was able to get me the perfect sized unit for a great price. Saved me $300 over my previous storage unit.
Thank you Pati.

P.S. Updated review 6/29/2020.
The Anaheim Storquest continues to go above and beyond for their customers. I’m just as happy with them now as I was a year ago.  Patti is still there and just as helpful and full of personality as always.
Thank you.</review>

<review>My husband and I are so happy and grateful for the services provided by Pati and her team at Storquest. We found out we were moving out of state and needed a place to store our valuables. The customer service was impeccable and our minds are at ease knowing that our things are stored in a safe facility with people who care about their customers! Thank you Pati for making this process seamless and helping us with our next adventure!!</review>< pictures>

<text>Dude asked me to write a review. So here you go.

First day here at the storage units and one of the elevators is broken down. One of the ONLY two elevators they have here for the entire building. It was a bit crowded but everybody was being friendly and helpful to each other.

You would think at some point while elevator number one was broken they would’ve called the service to come and fix the thing. They didn’t. Then  the second elevator breaks down. So while I have some free time I’m writing your review.

And for kicks they don’t even have access to the stairs so we can’t even get up there mianially. So we stuck here in the rain with nowhere to store our stuff. And it’s raining. Thanks guys< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_id>117199173587280648371< /user_id>< rating>

SO, this place is Awesome! overall here’s a quick breakdown of REAL pros cons:

PROS: brand new facility amazing and climate controlled! Quality stuff.
- security 24/7 cameras all over
- gated and very well lit
- actual units are easy to get to and everything fits well.
- CHRIS is the man to go to!

CONS: Admin and lock fee. / 45$
- No bathroom access after 6pm when lobby closes. ( should let us in if we have our code!) offer bathroom to paying clients
- Basic insurance / 10$ a month not included. Some places include this, they do NOT.
- Access code is 9 digits long! Wayyy too long’ drop it to 4-5 digits please. We are way too busy to be inputting the code a million times or remembering it along with all our other CODES for phone bank etc.
- SIZES of ALL units are rounded UP! about 2feet smaller than what’s listed.All the ones I checked measured less than listed for the price.
- Most places offer a free truck to use locally to move your stuff. This place does NOT. They should have a truck with thier logo! This way they are being promoted as we use the truck. WIN WIN! 🤓</Text>

What I encountered was two very friendly staff who were funny, open, transparent, personable, obviously customer focused, and clearly happy to work for StorQuest.

My initial interaction with Martin Cazarez and Chris Naidu made all the difference.  The staff who represent a company make that first impression and set the tone which ultimately affects the outcome of the experience and sale.

Martin shared a brief history of his time with StorQuest and the success of the Anaheim location in the first month it opened.  Take note, storage space renters!  They're filling up fast here, so do yourself a favor and reserve your space ASAP.  You won't find another storage rental company  like this.  Clean, extended hours, a conference room (Free to reserve) for businesses that rent space, lots of equipment, lots of LIGHT (motion sensor activated), reasonable pricing, virtually tamper proof locks, and restrooms that are well kept too!

Chris Naidu was very funny and completely focused on my needs.  He showed genuine concern about getting me into the right space and interest in making it as easy as possible to move my things into a unit.

StorQuest sets the bar high for it’s competitors (the competition have a LOT of work to do), but the manager and staff who are essentially the face of StorQuest are setting StorQuest apart from the rest.</Review>

The prices are much more cheaper than your normal storage places. I feel very safe here the whole scenerie is just impeccable. Most important the management they have is top notch. You can tell they really strive to make the customer happy and everyone is very helpful and professional. They have the best manager Martín modeling that behavior. His customer service exceeded my expectations!!! He lives by their quote "make room for Awsome" . Not only did he take his time with us showing us all the different u it's and prices but he was very patient and professional. He also took his time explaining the contract to avoid any surprises later like we encountered in our previous storage company. Martín, really models the behavior of great customer service. I hope Storquest continues the great job!! You will not be disappointed I promise you this.</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>
