Working with Tally Flotron as an interim manager at Corona Regional has been very rewarding.  For the months she has been filling in I have observed and seen more great  qualities and leadership than we had with our previous manager. She acts immediately and follows through with situations that need immediate attention.   She listens and with discussion comes to an amiable solution to problems.  She is an excellent manager with great  leadership guidance for all employees.<//Review>

Shout out to Field Supervisor Denisha at MPS in Murrieta California! Thank YOU for always being so supportive not only of my many first times on new posts, but always of me and my many questions and scheduling requests. You never say no, wait or say "I don’t have time!" I’m not sure where I’d be without you on our team. Thanks for being flexible and willing to get me more hours and time when needed.< /Text>

I had to visit Inland Valley recently and I was very impressed with the security. The manager helped us personally. She was very humble and went out of her way to expedite the care we were seeking.
No one enjoys hospital visits so it was nice to have someone help us make the visit the least stressful as possible.< /text>

Thank you MPS Security for the protection you provided for our special event. I appreciate the professional way your staff communicated and also the demeanor of the guards.

I would like to commend the security officer working on the 16th around 140pm when I arrived for my son whom was coming in by ambulance.  As I awaited to get back to my son this lady comes in and starts yelling at me for not having a mask on.I was completely distrot as this lady becomes confrontational with me. The security officer without hesitation steps between us to disfuse her aggressively attacking me, advising the lady to step out side. If it wasn't for him I would've completely lost control of myself with her. The guy did a good job. You have a good guard at Inland and I appreciate that.. I also appreciate the kindness of the nurses and the Security Manager whom with full empathy  contacted me and wanted to assure I was ok and if there was anything she could do to better my experience while at the hospital.  I felt security and hospital staff were genuine and actually cared.<//Review>

We were shocked and sorry to hear about your negative experience and welcome you to have a phone call directly with our executive team to discuss any further concerns about your visit while in the ER.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback and are hopeful for the opportunity to discuss further on a phone call. We have met with the dedicated Security Supervisor for this specific site and will continue our investigation process through out this week. Please let us know if there is a number we can connect with you directly at and a time of your convenience.\n\nMPS Management'}< /Resp>

MPS SECURITY has been a HORRIFIC experience for me!  They are bullies to an elderly, refuse to help, are incompetent, and think they are God!
John, handed me a complaint form, then, immediately grabbed it from my hand when I stated:
“I don’t want you handing my complaint to the right source, I don’t trust you!  I will personally mail it, what’s the address?”

He became enraged when I told him I would find another form online!  He continued trouble harassment throughout our 7 hour stay in ER!  A K-9was present as well as 3 other Security Guards!

MPS SECURITY needs serious investigation, specially when they are suppose to provide service to the public!

My experience at Inland Medical Center in Wildomar, CA, was a total NIGHTMARE!  I thought I could trust MPS SECURITY for help, how wrong I was!  John is about 6’ 3” tall about 345# who loves to intimidate a 4’ 10” tall, 109# Senior Citizen female!</Text>

Years ago, I placed an order with TouchUpDirect and got the product I expected, more or less when I was led to expect it.  My latest order has been an unqualified disaster.  Not only have they not delivered on the timeline implied by the "Rush" service I paid for, but I can't even get a clear explanation from their Support people about what they have done so far, or will do to fix this.  Over a week after my 2-5 day "Rush" order, all I have is a USPS tracking number that indicates they've printed a shipping label, but haven't put the product in the shipper's hands.

I can't even get an admission from them that this is wrong.  Customer report via email, which is the ONLY method they allow for as-yet-undelivered orders, has been very slow and murky.

I can accept that mistakes can happen.  I just expect that when they do, the company will own them and make them right.  I can't even get an admission from these folks that there is a problem, and now really wish I had purchased elsewhere.<//Text>

I ordered a color and clear coat pens.  The color coat had less than 5 drops and the clear coat pen arrived empty.  I also couldn't remove the brush end of the clear coat pen.  This company is a real ripoff.< /review>

<Time>1596547180384</Time><rate>2</rate><Text>The edge of my door that needed a touch up and I elected to use the pens since it was such a thin are along the edge. The color was a good match but unfortunately the process and use of pens was extremely difficult. I applied multiple coats and waited in between coats as directed. The material on the pen felt very hard and paint was being pulled off whenever I applied the clear coat to a spot (even after use of the primer). I waited overnight after a couple tries of clear coat since the paint getting pulled off and it still wasn’t doing the trick. I know you it’s a not going to be perfect and for the most part, it’s difficult to tell the edge has any colors but I don’t think the pens were a good choice and I don’t feel confident that this job is finished. I have some more research to do....< /Text>< Pics>

<pics>None</pics><Review>I purchased a touch up kit to paint a new bumper cover for a 2011 Subaru Forester.  I sent in the paint code for the car.  The color matched very well.  The video instructions were helpful.  I was pleased with the results.  I would purchase from Touch Up Direct in the future, and recommend them to others.< /Review><Time>1560281000106< /Time>< GmapID>

I see that some of the reviews say that the product is terrible and other reviews say the product is excellent.

Put me in the group that says the product is excellent.

A little background of my purchase and reason for the purchase.

I was parked in a market parking lot.  Some moron back into my car and scraped off a fairly large area of paint and made some large scratches.  The area was about two feet in measurement.

I sanded the area then used the aerosol cans that I bought from the company.  I sprayed about four light coats of paint.  After it was dry, I used a couple of coats of clear coat aerosol, that also came from the company.

The paint is an exact match.

I paid almost $60 for the two cans, including delivery.  It would have cost me a few hundred dollars if I had taken the car to a body shop.

Paint me one happy customer - -< /text>

<Text>Okay let me first start by saying that I did mess up on my own with this project to an extent. My roof was fading only on the driver side and the rear bumper needed paint work but only on one section. Instead of doing the entire roof and the entire rear bumper, I just redid the sections that needed to be repainted. I spent tons of time researching how to prep, paint, and then what to do following the paint job. I was meticulous and spent a ton of time (over 30 hours total) doing two small sections making sure I had done everything correctly. The final product was beyond disappointing, the finish seems to be a few shades off (I triple checked and made sure it was the correct color code) and there is absolutely no gloss to the finish whatsoever. It looks like the color is completely flat. I buffed it and polished it over and over to try to get any shine out of the paint, but it still stays a flat/matte color. I am taking my car to a body shop to fix the mess. For someone that is tight on a budget, just pay a few extra bucks to go to the professionals, instead of trying to do it yourself and ultimately paying to have someone else do it as well.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Excellent service and product. No one matches with greater accuracy and after using them at least 2 dozen times over the last few years I finally was faced with a minor mismatch (due to a vehicle that was 20 years old) and they responded next day with a perfect alternative product and no excuses. Great company.</Text>< Pictures>

I am revising my review of this product from 1 Star to 5 Stars after working with the team at TouchUpDirect Joe in particular. After my initial experience (see below), I contacted them and they were more than willing to help me get my project fixed. They shipped out another batch of paint and offered instructions on how to prep and paint my car which ultimately came out to look brand new. This customer service has prompted me to order more paint products from them for other projects yielding in great finishes.

If you order from TouchUpDirect do yourself a favor and please follow the prescribed directions for your project.< /review>

I ordered the essential package from Amazon and got a can of paint and a can of clear coat. The paint is runny and the nozzle is uneven. Duplicolor paint from the auto parts store looks better than this stuff. Save your money, it is not worth the price.</review>

<review>I ordered Sable Brown for my 83 Porsche 944 to repaint the engine bay. The product, AMAZING. I sanded rough areas with 800 grit, sprayed, let dry (looked good), then clear coated. I didn't even have to try to fade it with the original paint, it just blended perfectly. I don't know this company but I know this paint was AMAZING.

I thought this would be a good idea for a small portion, (my hood) I was told it's perfect for it. I opted for the aerosol cans, followed the directions exactly because I drove 2 hours to pick it up in person. As in started to apply the clear it seemed under pressured because it wasn't coming out uniformly.  And some parts came out nice looking but parts where it came out lightly look horrible. 3 months after application the clear started to peel off and the base coat was cracked all over....</review>

Purchased touch up for my Titanium 2005 CBR1000RR. Not a match, too dark. Followed their instructions to a T, even used the test sheet prior to applying. Worst part is that when I reached out to request a refund...nothing. No response whatsoever.

Do NOT recommend.</review>

The reason I take time to write reviews is because the most important part of doing business with any company is the Customer Service.  Like many online retailers, it can be difficult to get a human on the phone however they are VERY quick to respond to email and they truly STAND behind their product.  When you spend $100 on something, you hope a company will stand behind their product and customers.  The fact is they easily deserve 5 STARS due to their  Customer Service. They stand behind their product and Sam, the Customer Service person, delivered as promised.

As for the product, TouchUp Direct is the real deal and their paint was a perfect match.  I am saying this as someone who owns two Pearl White vehicles which require a 3 Stage Paint job.  For those Amateur DIYers, this was more difficult than expected.  The Base Coat from TouchUpDirect was SPOT ON however it's the mid coat, provides the sparkle look, was a bit difficult to blend.  Take their advice and PRACTICE... if not, you will end up making a huge mistake and this paint is expensive.  I attempted to fix a spot with paint from AutoZone and Advance Auto and the quality was terrible and the color was not even close.

I can't thank them enough for not "screwing" the customer like so many other online vendors. Great JOB!!< /Review>

<text>I have bought touch up paint from Touch Up Direct for:

1- Volkswagen Jetta
2-BMW'S
1- Range Rover

All have matched perfectly with the exception of one of the BMW's, HOWEVER, I am confident they will make good on their product! The color I am trying to match is a specialty color that is VERY hard to match. I was smart enough to make sure the paint was a perfect match and put it on the underside of one of the side rocker- where it will not be seen! (And yes, I am female- some of us have common sense- LOL)

I do not care if they are running their business out of their grandmothers basement. Small family owned businesses are better at making sure their customers are happy!

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>I drive a 07 Tungsten pearl Lexus IS250. It was missing a front lip and a rear bumper cover I ordered the parts that were missing and it was unpainted when it arrived. So I had to look for paint that would match the original perfectly. A 2 toned lexus was unacceptable. Some how I found touch up direct on the web. And so I thought it couldn't hurt. So i ordered their complete kit. It had everything I would need. And it was a perfect match but the clear coat included in the kit was a little hard to work with. I had to put on a lot to get the desired mirror like finish I was looking for. So w spots I put so much on it would run and it wouldn't even get shinny even after buffing and waxing. I ended up using dupli-color brand clear coat with a much better result. So I wouldnt get the clear. Oat from them but their color was a perfect match. 4 out of 5.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Their costumer service stinks.  They did not ship my product FedEx like I paid for.  When I contacted them about this, they said it was a mistake, but did not refund me for the shipping on the product.  I would never use them again as they do not seem to care about their costumers and just want their money</Text>

Found this place on offer up with great reviews then checked the Google reviews as well. Even with a couple hiccups on color not being what I wanted on the first wheels I choose. Mario did a excellent job of getting me a different  set of wheels for an excellent price as fast as he could. 22x10 285/40/22 hellcat replicas<//review>

This is a good place for a good price on rims and all but unfortunately I wasn't all that satisfied because I had bought a set of rims and tires and when they were installed on my car the wheels were too big and were scraping my car. I wanted to exchange them for a smaller size but they said no which sucks because it was within days that I wanted the exchange and thought they would do exchanges especially since they're still brand new. So if you're ever purchasing make sure you really do know what size you want because there's no going back which is a bummer.< /review>

<Date>1471519688460<//Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Was looking for a wheel that wasn't all black or all chrome for my BMW X5, I wanted a more aggressive look. I found this company off of eBay and ordered a set of wheels and tires. he emailed me with his cell phone number to confirm sizes etc for shipment, already great communication from the start.
After talking with Mario, he educated me on many factors and questions I had. In the end he helped me pick different tire sizes for the look I more so desired, instead of what I ordered because he knew the look I was going for. The shipment was so fast! I maybe waited a week and we were working out details a day or so after I ordered because I wanted bigger/wider tires. It arrived extremely early and the fed ex guy called ahead to schedule the pick up! Needless to say I had them ordered, changed my tire sizes, they were mounted and balanced when they came off the truck I had them put on 2 hours after I received them and I am extremely satisfied, all within two weeks!! My import mechanic told me they fit perfectly no bolt conversions or anything my tires do not rub, it was the exact look I was looking for and I couldn't have done it without Mario! Did I mention he gave me his cell?! We communicated throughout the whole process he sent me a tracking number etc. This man knows his stuff, if you have any questions just talk to him because he can help you find what you are looking for. Thank you again! I know in the future when I want new wheels for my other vehicles I will buy from here again! (If you don't want an error message on BMW with the tpm you must take it to a import mechanic)<//Review>< pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I needed some rims/tires for my 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Found Rush wheels online and went there first (right up the street from VIP).  I didn’t have a good experience at all there (RUSH wheels tried to sell me poor quality tires I've never even heard of and also the wrong size wheels for my SUV (come to find out later after doing my own research).  I left there and found VIP Exotic Wheels by chance.  Got a set of nice Viper wheels, descent set of tires for a good deal (not to mention fast/friendly service) without any salesman BS.  I highly recommend this place.  Would buy here again.< /review>< Pics>

<text>It's really been a pleasure to have found this place. I'm extremely happy with the end results because they handled my case in an outstanding way. Those who helped me were very optimistic which made me feel more reassured. They were always in-touch, keeping me updated and were able to answer any questions I had. I'm grateful to the whole team. Especially to 𝐋𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐚 𝐆𝐮𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐫, she is very professional and trustworthy!! My husband and I are so pleased to have had her work on our case. We recommend her to literally anyone who needs an attorney. Honestly, don't hesitate to call Auto Fraud because they'll do everything in their power to help you. If I ever need help again I'll definitely come back!

Thank you so much again, 𝐋𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐚 𝐆𝐮𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐫, for fighting for us during the worst months of the pandemic.</text>< user>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Jason Stones did a thorough, attentive and professional job in resolving a dispute over a  vehicle I financed through a dealership. Whereas another attorney dismissed my concerns rather quickly, Jason took the time to review my documentation and break the legal process down in simple language to understand.

I am very happy with the outcome of my case and would confidently recommend him to anyone regarding vehicle purchase disputes with dealerships.

Jason thank you again for all of your help these past few months.

This was a complicated rv case with multiple parties involved. Our attorney, Jeff LePere, was always confident that we would win our case. Jeff, and his office staff were always in communication with us regarding any updates. He was able to get us a very fair settlement without going to court. We are very satisfied customers. We highly recommend this firm!</text>

I hope that anyone that is even questioning whether they have a case because they feel they have been wronged sees this post.
Do NOT wait! Pick up the phone and call the Auto Fraud Legal Center and ask for Jason Stone. You will not regret making that call. Take it from me I contacted several attorneys and either I didn't hear back from them or I was given the run around which only wasted my time and made me angry.

One phone call with valuable information and instructions provided me with factual information that I searched 2 years to find out. I was never asked for a penny out of my pocket. Jason was patient and ALWAYS available to answer my questions either by text or phone call direct. That's personal service at its best.

Contacting them was the best decision I have could have made.

How do you thank someone for making you whole again? How do you thank someone for sticking with you when someone else lies and will not accept fault for the damage that they have caused which has harmed you and impacted your life in so many areas and in not a good way?

Hawk and Jason...Thank you for making me whole again. For protecting me and for fighting for me. You did an amazing job! I will always be thankful to you for giving me the representation I needed to get some type of justice after simply purchasing a SUV from Encinitas Ford.< /text>

<username>Peter Zaayer< /username><rating>5</rating><Review>I contacted the Auto Fraud Legal Center here in San Diego with what I thought was a simple case of just making a dealership honor their used car warranty that came with the purchase. I spoke Daniel Medina. She was very experienced and professional. What was great about her experience after listening to my story, she had a hunch that we might be looking at something much bigger than I was aware of!  I brought my car in to have inspected by their top notch accident investigator. What he revealed shocked me!  This car had basically been rebuilt, and he showed my all of the evidence.

Daniela and her team walked me through the entire process and their recommendations. Yep, this turned out to be a car that was illegally sold to me by the dealership. I would never have known that unless Daniela’s experience led us to find this out!  The firm is very professional and keeps in contact with you the entire way. When you have The Auto Fraud Legal Center (AFLC) representing you, the car dealerships start to shake!

Daniela and her team were able to get my case quite favorably for me. I was able to use the money and the experience to move onto my next car buy much more confidently!

If you ever have any kind of legal case with your car, I HIGHLY recommend you give AFLC a call and meet with them!  Nobody can defend you better!< /Review>< Pictures>

My husband and I have been looking for help in many places but didn’t have any luck until we found Rosner, Barry & Babbitt. We couldn’t be thankful for all the work they did to get what we wanted. They are very professional and transparent. Thanks to them we won our case. We honestly recommend them, 100% honest work and Daniela was always in contact with us. Such a great team they are.< /Review>

<review>Very professional and very polite. They are a pleasure to work with and have known how to deal with dealerships and the games they pull. I can’t give them a high enough rating for what they did. I called many offices just to be told there’s no case here and move on. You have to be patient and provide many documents for them to do their job. They fought hard for me and the payout was much more than I was expecting. The amount of back information about what happened that you guys found was unbelievable and honestly made me know right then I found the right firm to represent me. To the entire team thank you for everything as well as teaching me many of the tricks they pull and what to look for next time. It was a pleasure and mean this in the best of way I hope I never have to visit your office again! 😃 But if there is any issue with a vehicle or purchase of one I know where I’ll be going back to. Stay safe and happy new year.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

I’ve written my fair share of reviews but this one I hope can convey my enthusiasm for the wonderful experience I had with this firm more than any other review I’ve written.
Jeff in the auto lemon department was able to, in a very short time, hear of my situation and come up with solutions that I would’ve never thought about on my own. His intelligence and his knowledge of the law shine through and helped change my very pessimistic view of the human race, at least for a short time by reminding me that not all people are like the unscrupulous car dealer who took me for a couple of grand. There ARE good people in this world and it seems some of them can be found in this firm. I’d highly recommend them.< /Review>

I had numerous issues with my brand new Acura, and after multiple trips to the service department, they could not fix the problems. Corporate was not interested in assisting me. I had never done a Lemon Law and had no idea what to expect. I consulted with one Lemon Law Attorney and he did not want my case. He said Honda Corp was very hard to negotiate with. I felt defeated until I reached out to Rosner, Barry & Babbitt and I was contacted by Attorney Leonard Kolakowski. After listening to my concerns and reviewing all of my documentation, he took my case. Leonard was always very responsive to my emails and phone calls, explaining the steps along the way. I felt he did an excellent job representing me and even though the process was very long, the outcome of my case was better than I had anticipated.<//Text>

We came across Auto Fraud searching the internet in desperate need of a legal consultation. The dealership did not want to honor the warranty.  Our experience from day one was stellar! Our attorney, Tsolik Kazandjian, was responsive, honest, fair, knowledgeable and truth worthy from our first contact. Our vehicle ordeal took over 3 weeks of stress and frustration before the dealership conceded, as I’m sure the owner felt we were under the guidance of attorney pursuing a lawsuit. During these three weeks the dealership kept trying to negotiate with us, our responses with Tsolik’s guidance truly helped us fight this disagreement. Our goal was to ultimately take this case to litigation, however once the dealership conceded to everything we were entitled to we took the offer. We truly appreciate all the time and effort Tsolik and her partners provided us with the client’s (me) best interest as priority. This was a refreshing and great experience with top notch level firm!

I would definitely highly recommend this firm! Thank you Tsolik!<//text>

The service I received exceeded my expectations.

Michelle Cook and Lilia Guizar were very professional and provided excellent customer service.  They effectively communicated with me every step of the way and were very attentive to any questions or concerns I had.

Dear Ms. Lilia,

Please take this letter as a "Thank you" for all your time and effort.

I greatly appreciate the time you took on my claim to explain, translate and go over every document in English and Spanish. This was extremely helpful.

Those many phone calls were also very helpful in order to bring me up to speed on my case. You even took the time outside of office hours to follow through  on any pending matters and/or questions I might have had, which were many, to be answered.

You are a very valuable asset to Rosner, Barry, Babbitt LLP not only for your hands on work, but also for your above and beyond EXCELLENT customer service.

Take care and once again, thank you for such great service.

Sincerely,
Israel Ayala< /Review>

Would not take the case and stated it was fishy. When I was the victim of a dealer not paying off a consignment car and not getting the title to the rightful owner. I would not recommend at all, as they could not even advise what to do next. Definitely not military friendly at all nor professional in their email correspondence.< /text>

< Review>
I purchased a car - and a warranty - based on a car fax, which indicated no Accidents - which included a Car Buy Back  Guarantee- The dealership would not honor the Warranty or the Car Buy Back Guarantee  - I was willing to keep the car, if they honored the warranty, which they would not do, because of an accident that was not included in the CarFax.

Needless to say I was livid, the dealership would not negotiate and called security and the police on me for absolutely no reason.

I called the Auto Fraud Legal Center. Not only did they make them buy back the car, they made them pay back all the money I spent on the car, and got punitive damages. This took less than 4 months - during a Pandemic...this team is AMAZING!

THEY EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS and literally got me more than 10 times what I originally requested from the dealership. If you are seeking justice and have a legitimate claim, these guys will handle it efficiently and quickly...<//Review>

<text>My wife and I were happy to purchase a vehicle after years of saving. Yet, it turned out to be that the vehicle was not what was expected. The Auto Fraud Legal Center was there to help us when we did not know what to do. Jason Stones was great in communication and helped us through the process. I would recommend their profession to anyone who believes that they have been a victim of auto fraud. Thank You Auto Fraud Legal Center for your help we are very grateful for your service.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf930a4f59af1:0x5e025713d1897984</gmap_id></record>

They went above and beyond my expectations for my case! I didn’t expect such a great outcome! Lilia Guizar was patient, kept her word and was very understanding! She answered all my questions, even when I asked them several times! If myself or anyone I know ever need anything, I know where I would go or recommend!” – Auto fraud legal center!!!!!
Very Knowledgeable, Quick and Trustworthy</Review>

<Text>This law group did very little to help me with Toyota of El Cajon and K Motors dba Toyota of El Cajon. They tried to tell me Toyota of El Cajon was dba.  K Motors. The lawyers met and as a group decided that there was nothing wrong with me paying $68,000  for a 2019 used Toyota Camry with 24,000mi., when a new Camry was selling for under $25,000.</Text>< pictures>

The staff and especially "Michelle Cook" (the attorney on my case) were very atendtative, professional and understanding of my needs and expectations.  I would recommend this company , in a heartbeat , if anyone were to ask "who I would recommend for repensentation?"  It would be this company( ROSNER, BARRY & BABBITT!!) They are a positive and reliable group on your side!
"THEY ARE A WINNING TEAM!!!"

Great law firm! The dealer sold me an unsafe car with damages worth half of the total purchase price.it was a long process, but Michael Klitzke didn’t give up and fought until he finally got them to give me back the money I had payed them. Michael Klitzke and Lilia Guizar make a really Great team! They always kept me update with status on the case and always answer my questions right away. Thank Michael and Lilia you guys are the best.< /review>

Spoke  with JASON STONES, explained my entire situation to him in detail and sent him all documentation requested. He made it seem like we had a case and stated he was going to investigate everything.

2 weeks later, absolutely nothing changes, he emails me and tells me I have no case. I asked him what changed from the original phone call, never got a response.

Highly recommend contacting another law firm that is actually willing to help before wasting weeks here.< /text>

I cannot thank this whole law firm enough. Since the first contact I had with them, they have been nothing but professional. They answered every question I had and made sure I understood exactly what was happening. They kept me updated every step of the way. And they fought for me and won of course. Greg and Hal are wonderful, and I want to thank them once again for making me feel at ease and giving me the strength and encouragement to face the opposition. I am so grateful to have found this law firm! You guys are the best! Thank you again!< /text>

<text>I had a case with this law firm. at the beginning they told me every thing is free, but after 2 years and going to court multiple times they did not let me settle with the dealer. At the end, I lost the case and now I have a lawsuit in my public court index history and when I want to get a job it shows up in my background check. I was not told about these aftermath. They ended up getting a lot of money,but I got nothing since I lost, and all the bad records are for me. And now the dealer is going to sue me and I have to pay them back for years, and this law firm does not care about it.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I am currently dealing with Jeff LePere. This is absolutely the worst professional I have ever delt with. He doesn’t respond to emails, he returns phone calls at his own leisure sometimes a week later or even longer depending on how many messages you leave him. He will tell you one thing and then never comes through or follows up. As a representative for someone the service provided is horrible. I wish I could have stayed with Mrs. Kendra Woods because atleast she took the time to respond to me and my questions. I do not recommend Auto Fraud Legal Center as the experience feels like just as much of a scam as the people I purchased my vehicle from. I was told 3 weeks ago that I would have documents to sign for my settlement and I would receive a check within 40 days and here we are 3 weeks later and I haven’t even received anything to sign. I guess when it’s not your money and it doesn’t affect your life it’s not important. What a joke.<//review>

<Review>I want to start by saying thank you to Rosner, Barry, & Babbitt; Attorneys at law, especially Michael Klitzke for being in my corner when I lost hope.
They were so polite and so professional. They answered questions sooner than I ever expected each time. This firm is heaven sent! Simply amazing. Not only for winning our case, but for getting us what we deserved back, and most importantly, for giving us a chance when other firm's didn't!

Life's about living and sometimes we encounter unfortunate events like this, but just like simply living, we have hero's who walk among us.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I hired them in June. It is now October and I have heard from the office once. Their delay seriously impacted my case, possibly making the case noncollectable. Really unprofessional.<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Without a doubt they are professionals. Thank you all because starting with the secretariats they were always very kind. And Arlyn escalante is the best always very friendly and always answered my questions either by phone or email. Mainly thanks to God and then thanks to them we won our case. I can recommend this place and also refer you to my friends and acquaintances. Too bad there is no 10 star rating. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP.

Sin duda alguna son unos profesionales. Gracias a todos porque empezando por las secretarías siempre fueron muy amables. Y Arlyn escalante es la mejor siempre muy amable y siempre contestó a mis preguntas ya fuera por teléfono o por correo electrónico. Principalmente gracias a Dios y después gracias a ellos ganamos nuestro caso. Puedo recomendar este lugar y así mismo referirlos con mis amigos y conocidos. Lástima que no hay calificación de 10 estrellas. MUCHAS GRACIAS A TODOS POR SU AYUDA.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf930a4f59af1:0x5e025713d1897984< /gmap_id></record>

First time visiting this place this past weekend - nice outdoor seating area with tables socially distanced from each other. Orders are taken by staff and brought to you, and the outdoor space has large screens playing music videos. Drinks were decent but it's cash only - so bring your own (but they told me there's also an atm).

Also, park on the street - it's an alley entrance but there's no parking back there and a ton of people chill back there - better to not even do down there.</review>

I enjoy the fact that it features both indoor and outdoor patio areas. The drinks are honest and a phenomenal value and if you're lucky you'll be served by the vision of a trans or CD lady. I enjoy going there for the Sunday afternoon beer busts. The option to sing karaoke is also included. Really refreshing to be able to enjoy a gay bar where yes there's a good crowd but there's also enough room to spread out and walk around and change the scenery so to speak from time to time. Sign up with their website for special events.</text></record></dataset><record>

Maybe somewhere near the seedy industrial areas near the river between PCH and Anaheim. That would have been perfect with a lot of truckstops and the port near by.<//Text>< Pictures>

I love this new bar! Was there a couple times for Sunday beer bust/underwear party and had a blast! Very friendly bartenders, reasonable prices, the djs are great especially Hazmat and Yello who play everything from 80s to today's hits. They have Outside smoking patio, pool table. So much fun and great music.<//Text>

The short: The 5 star reviews are absolutely correct. This is the tint shop you are looking for.

Had my wife brand new 2020 Q7 tinted last week. To keep it short, I am very particular about our cars especially window tint. We just moved to Roseville last year so I obviously we had to find a new tint shop. I did some research, called around and got a few estimates. The moment I found A+ and saw the reviews I thought, "there's no way" it can't be this good. Well when they were able to get us in SAME DAY, offered me a loaner shop vehicle if needed and was the best price of the three others...I could not be more happy with the results! We had literally everything tinted including one very large window that I know would be challenging (along with thinned to remove some existing tint) and I expected a few flaws. Again A+ proved me wrong! Tint is flawless, better than what we expected and the customer service was outstanding. As long as we live in Roseville A+ will be our new tint shop and will be the only choice when asked who I personally recommend.<//Review>

<review>This is beyond 5 stars, They did my Boss's Tahoe so i was able to first hand see the work they did.

I dropped it off before work and he called me right as i was getting off work that it was ready.

Went over information and care for the windows.

Will be bringing my wife's car soon.< /review><Response>None< /Response>< UserId.>

Amazing work! Great customer service. We got the ceramic tint 20% front windows, 50% back windows and rear windshield. We are very happy with the outcome.</text>

Excellent customer service! Staff went above and beyond to show appreciation since I am from out of town. Showed up without an appointment but they were still able to get my car a full window service in a decent amount of time. Very impressed with the finished product! My car looks so amazing! :) Definitely a 5 star overall!< /Review>

<user>111815832096664773505< /user><text>A+ Window tint, worthy of the name. I called to schedule a future appointment and called me back when there was a cancelation and move my appointment, give me a loaner car. The tint installation looks great. If you need quality service look no further.< /text><date>1613535445387</date>< Resp>

This is the place to get your tint done. Friendly team I’ve come to know in love. My car looks badass now. Best price around, trust me, I’ve checked. I’d go again but I ran out of windows<//Text>

<Text>They were an absolute pleasure to do business with! I inquired for a quote on Tuesday and they were able to get me in the very next day! I've contacted other companies and they were all saying it would be about a month until I could get my windows tinted. Highly would recommend for any tint work!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Amazing amazing work. I know nothing about window tinting. You could tell me they just paint the windows black and I’d probably believe you (okay I’m not THAT bad) but A+ did a beautiful job on my car. From the immaculate shop, to the pristine “loaner car” (that looks like it’s cleaned after every user) to the beautiful work I’m really impressed. Never felt like I was being up sold or pushed into anything (which would have been easy to do as I know so little.) I did a lot of research and I’m so glad I picked you guys for my car. To anyone on the fence-tint your windows, go with A+ and listen to the guys in the shop, they’re pros! Truly grateful and HIGHLY recommend!! Thanks guys!!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<text>Slavik helped me out today when I was in a real pinch. I needed my window tint removed because I was selling my car the next day and he stopped what he was doing and helped me out in a time of need. It’s been a while since I’ve experienced such amazing customer service and he definitely sets the bar. I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a job done correctly with friendly, honest service. Thank you Slavik! I will be back again and again.

I was able to get an appointment for next day. He worked around my schedule with picking up my daughter. Superb customer service. Finished the tint at the exact time he said it would be done.
Would highly recommend! Also, would highly recommend clear windshield tint. Makes a world of difference with the heat.</Review>

Tint came out amazing at a reasonable price for my Jeep wrangler. Went for 20% Ceramic on the sides and 50% Ceramic on the windshield. Really appreciate the effort they put in to squeeze me in their day. Beyond exceptional work and outstanding customer service.<//review>

So far since this was done just a few hours ago I rate them a 5. The gentleman who helped me this morning around 1015/1030 am was very kind. He/they did a good job on the tint. I'm happy this far. If anything changes I will do a update. But for now I would recommend them for sure.</text>

A+ Window Tinting did an excellent job on my car, I called them over the phone and they gave me a quote and took my car the same day. When I got there I was informed on the types of tint available and chose the best one that works for me. It looks great and very clean, good customer service and very professional!</text>

<Review>I have been taking my vehicles to A+ and recommending their services for 4 years now. I don’t even want to hear about another tint company. They have tinted 6 of my own cars in this time, and at least 10 cars of people I’ve recommended. Simply the best and that’s it!< /Review>< Name>

<Text>I took my Audi S8 plus to get my windows tinted and they came out perfect. They opened early for me so they can finshish by the end of the day. They had to strip the lighter tint that was already on the car and put the darker tint that I requested. They did a great job.  Plus they gave me a loaner car so I didn't have to wait around. These guys are the best.</Text>< gmap_id>

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐'s for sure. Amazing. These guys are good. I'm a small business owner and tint all my trucks. I tried A+ Window Tinting for my RAM 2500 and they knocked it out of the park. I'll be taking future vehicles here for sure.</Review>

<Review>Just had work done for the 2nd time from this place, the experience the second time around was just as good as the first time! Does quality work and in a timely manner. Both times I've been there the guy(s) working seem pretty busy but both times my vehicle was done same day.

If you're needing windows replaced and tinted, I'd recommend hitting up Exceptional Auto Glass, right across the way from A+, to do the window replacement, then the guys @ Exceptional will walk your new window(s) to A+ for tinting. Got a windshield replaced, tinted, in 3 hours time.

This si the only place I'll go for all my tinting needs.<//Review>< Pics>

If you're looking for a local place to get your windows tinted then you need to check this place out. I called to get a quote in the morning, and they were able to get me in the same day which was great. I was explained the different tint options that were available and pricing was clearly explained. The finished product looked great and I felt the price was competitive with other tint shops. Definitely give these guys a shot!<//Review>

<Text>I met with Slavic late afternoon to inquire about window tint for my 2019 370 Z. I wasn’t sure which shade or percentage of shade I wanted, so Slavic took time to explain each shade percentage in addition to offering carbon tint which is a superior product which I wasn’t even aware of. Based upon how flexible Slavic was and willingness to accommodate my schedule, I was able to get the job done that same day. I  was able to watch him in action and was amazed how Meticulous he was with each detail of the prep and application process. The windows came out perfectly and I could not have been happier. I would recommend Slavic without exception especially if you own a high-end vehicle and want it to look perfect. Give him a call as his service and prices are exceptional. Thank you Slavic! You did an amazing job and my ride looks showroom ready.< /Text></record>

I’m so glad my co-worker recommended A+ Window Tinting to me. Slavic prices are reasonable and his work is superb. I highly recommend the ceramic tinting. The film he uses is excellent quality and does a great job protecting my car from the harsh sun. Thanks Slavic. I am happy to recommend your business to anyone who needs window tinting.</Review>

<Review>I called in at 12:00pm to inquire about a quote to get my truck tinted and not only did the owner take his time explaining the available options he gave me a quote over the phone.

He asked me when I wanted to have them done and I said how about today? He said that he doesn't mind staying late to finish the work and had me drop off my truck at 4pm and supplied a rental car to get around town until he finished the job!

Excellent pricing and great customer service I would highly recommend A+ Window tinting!<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< gmapID>

<text>I just want to thank A+ window Tinting for a phenomenal job and service on my truck. Absolute top notch professionalism from all employees. I am as picky as they come with someone taking pride in window tint, this place exceeded my needs while doing it at a reasonable price. Thank you again, if you need your windows tinted go see A+ in Roseville.</text>< gmapID>

Literally just walked out of their shop after getting my Fiance’s Civic tinted for Christmas, and I am so amazed at their incredible work! Not only did they finish it very quickly (just over an hour!) but the windows look absolutely flawless and not a bubble in sight. I will 100% go back there in the future! He also took the time to explain to me all of the features of each different shade and I was very impressed. 10/10!!!</review>

<Text>I came to them last minute to get tinting before driving across country. With a booked schedule they asked if I could leave it over night and they would do their best to have it done by the end of next day (the day before I left). They had it done that night and did an amazing job!< /Text>< Pictures>

They did a great install of window tint on my car, but didn't warn me ahead of time about the "sparkle" or "spread" effect on approaching headlights if you put tint on the Windshield, nor did they warn me about the "Jacob's ladder" effect on the rear window from headlights on the rear defroster lines.<//Text>

Their service blew my mind. I came by to get a price quote on fixing a tint job I had done before in Lemon Grove. The rear view window was bubbling badly because the low-quality tint film was slowly letting air in whenever I ran my defrosters.
Slavik gave me a fair quote for the fix and, because I had a few places I still needed to get to for the day, let me use a loaner vehicle while mine was being worked on.
The final results were “A+” indeed! High quality film, no residue from the other film and looks factory-installed. They were also able to save my defrosters by getting the old film off without a razor. Great results and service, would definitely do business with them again.<//review>

Made a reservation and he was waiting for me. I stopped it off for the owner to work on. My truck was super Dusty so the owner took extra time cleaning my windows so the tint wouldn't scratch. I had a few bubbles the next day in one of the windows but went away the next day. He said he would redue if I want happy about it.<//review>

VERY POOR experiences with this organization! Facilities are good but every time I have suspended my account for any period of time they closed the account and I lost all credits. After the 3rd time you would think I would have learned! I would eagerly encourage anyone looking for tanning services to use another organization.< /Review>

<text>I recently moved to Cali from N. Carolina and I suffer with Fibromyalgia and Hypothyroidism. I use the tanning bed(s) for heat & light therepy. Some days, California Sun, and every single fabulous person that works there on Howe Ave, is the only thing to put a smile on this Florida (originally) native. 😀 The  actual tan, which is fabulous, is just a bonus. I am so grateful. Love, love, love this place. Thank you😍💞<//text>< pics>

I'll start off by saying that every time my wife and I have gone to California sun the staff is very friendly and helpful, and the machines are clean.

It's always a pleasant experience when we go into any of their locations.

However the communication from the corporate side was non-existent during the shutdown and reopening.

We were not alerted via email, call, or text about their closures but we assumed that they would be closing like most businesses. So that's not a big deal.

However we never received an email, call, or text when they reopened on May 25th.

We were charged for the month of June membership and that's how we found out they were open. So now we have missed out on March 20-31 which we paid for, and May 25-June 2 which we paid for. That's 20 days...about 2/3 of a month!

My wife and I pay over $100/month between the two of us. I would think we deserve a little communication. Or at the very least 20 days each of credit for tanning that we could have had we been notified.

So again the staff is friendly, the machines are clean, the communication sucks!!!< /text>

This place has highly questionable business practices. In addition to the annoyance of trying to get you to buy overpriced, cheap smelling lotions and upgrades every single time you go there, they make you agree to a contract unless you pay for individual sessions each time-- and the price is outrageous!
Then you try to cancel, and I even got verification of cancellation, and they continue to charge you. They have a D+ rating on the BBB, and my bank is going after them for fraud because they used a card with an expired date, so I am definitely not alone.
The other thing is this-- not once, not twice, but several times there were dead roaches in the room. There were also towels that felt wet and smelled in a supposedly cleaned bed.
I stopped going when Covid hit and I would never go now...that would be scary...but they tried to charge me when they reopened.
Between the long waits, pushy sales people, dirty facilities, and questionable business practices, I don't see how they can stay open.<//text>

I absolutely love this salon. The girls are super nice. They’re incredibly knowledgeable. I love that California Sun gives back to their customers on their social media. This is and always will be my favorite tanning salon. Andria and Sabina are literally the BEST. The beds are always clean and stocked with fresh towels. The atmosphere is always warm and inviting.< /Review>

Absolutely amazing! I love it here Andria and Sabina are my favorite of all times. Best beds I’ve seen, I’ve been to Cal sun Roseville and it don’t compare to my home salon. Howe is the best location it’s beautiful inside. Clean, and extremely friendly I would highly recommend this location 😊<//Text>

My only complaint is you have to keep a card on file which they will charge every month if u dont specify a plan prior to that time. Aside from that, the services & staff are fantastic!< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Avoid avoid avoid!! The billing process with this company is a joke! They were charging me and extra $25 a month on top of my monthly fee. They force you into a membership and if you ever want to cancel your membership...well good luck. I was moving halfway across the US and tried to cancel my membership. They said I needed to email a formal letter as to why I wanted to cancel it. After I did that, I was told, "We're sorry you come in in person to our headquarters building if you wish to cancel your membership" first of all that location was 5 hours away from where I had lived when I signed up and secondly I had already moved across the US. There was absolutely nooo way I was going to buy a plane ticket or drive over 24 hours just to get out of this stupid contract! I contacted several customer service reps and even mangers that said they can not help unless I come in. I ended up having to cancel my credit card just so they would stop charging me. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!
I will give them credit though, there stores are very nice, the beds are top notch, and I loved the upgrade options. If you go, don't do a membership just buy the individual tans (if they let you)</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x809ada44b4a2e34f:0x2cfe76967387aa00<//gmapID></record>

Everything about there billing is correct , it is designed for them to make money. What is this crap about they need in writing you want to cancel and you can't do it at the salon. See they want to make money. They will make it so in convenient for you there customer. Stop going and they will be put of business or read all the fine print and work the contract.<//Review>

This is a warning for California Sun contracts!  Even though most of their salons are nice and clean and employees were friendly (therefore 2 stars);  dealing with the fine print in the contract turned out to be a nightmare!
I went to the Fair Oaks location prior to my Caribbean vacation for a month of tanning.  I was told I could cancel any time and there was no long term commitment.

Immediately, after signing up it was clear that the first month's payment did not count towards the month-to-month contract.

In my case, I was charged another month and since I went on my trip, they offered a "Stay and Save".  A monthly $5 charge will be billed to your account,  up to 12 months, until you are ready to re-activate.  The kicker is, that when you re-activate, you have to pay another month pro-rated, before they use the money in your account.
This, to me, is very deceptive and not worth the hassle.

If you are planning to use California Sun's services, sign up at the end of the month, for that month's prorated fee, and cancel prior to the 20th of the next month.  Make sure you do that in writing at the corporate office, because they won't let you cancel at the salon.< /text>

Every time I have been in any of these locations there has ALWAYS been an angry customer at the counter. I signed up for a membership using my spouses card, staff was not knowledgeable. Went in the following day to tan and was told my membership was being cancelled for fraudulent activity since the card on file is my spouses and not mine. I was not refunded my membership and deposit totaling over $100 that was taken less than 24 hours earlier. The person who took my payment made no mention of an issue with the card being used.< /review>

This salon is a scam with the billing,DO NOT SING ANY CONTRACT WITH THEM AS A MEMBER. pay as you go, Here is why,the contract locks you in to 12 months,HAHA,with no end.I'm telling you the month to month is NOT HONORED..And when you want to end you contract you CAN NOT END THE CONTRACT AT ANY OF THE SALONS. You sing up at the salon ,but they expect you to drive to a different location,to the owner to end the contract.So keep it simple ,PAY AS YOU GO IT'S CHEAPER. Something else once you give them a credit card they have been known to charge your card without your consent.You may come in to tan,personal says you have to pay for this month your card didn't clear plus late fee.The owner has his computers set up to charge EVERYONE on the 1st, at 3:am,so if you have auto deposit on the first,you will now be charged the late fee too, the charge will not clear at that time of the morning. MOST banks do not release funds until 6:am.That's not all,they keep trying to charge your account until the charge go's through,even if you have just payed in cash at the salon.I know they did it to me over,and over.  If you don't catch this on your bank statement with in 90 days,( the bank an only collect for you the first three months of charges)you will have a very hard time getting reimbursed from the owner he thinks he got us,but I will expose him to a thing or two.   R U TAN is not like this,and there just around the corner :))))</Text>

<Time>1368650960260<//Time><rating>2<//rating><Review>I just discovered that this organization has been charging my credit card $20+ every month since the 1st of this year for a membership I had no knowledge of (and therefore obviously have never used.) In September of last year, I was verbally "sold" on a contract that was to expire at the end of the year, which was the major selling point for me seeing as how I was moving out of the area shortly before the year ended and therefore only needed tanning services for a minimal period of time. Had I been told at the time that the contract I was signing did NOT expire at the end of my package, I would have chosen a different package or set a reminder to cancel the membership shortly before the end of the year. I find it extremely misleading that this company thinks it is acceptable to have clients sign a written agreement which is contradictory to the verbal agreement arranged at the time of signature.You would think that an organization large enough to have multiple locations (that appear to be busy the majority of the time) would not have to resort to tricking members out of their hard earned money with barely legible fine print at the bottom of the contract. This is beside the fact that the sales people conveniently neglected to mention the membership would morph into a completely different membership at the end of the year, and a written cancellation notice was needed to terminate the contract. I find the organization of California Sun to be deceitful and basically immoral, not that it would mean anything to anyone there, since for them it is apparently all about creating revenue no matter if you have to trick people out of it. :-(<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
worst customer service in the world! their billing system is SUCH a scam, read all the other reviews...I am not the only victim. My account is currently frozen, which means they charge me $5/month to keep my account active, but am not tanning. My credit card # changed and they don't notify me for 2 months I have an overdue balance - the first email I receive I call to correct the info and the rude receptionist tells me my account has been charged not 1, but 2 late fees, so my account balance is 6 times the amount it should be...HA! I tell her to just cancel my account, but oh no...you have to put in a certified letter you are giving 30 days notice. I try to explain my side of the story but she was more concerned with reading the stupid script in front of her face over and over again. I am so over this company. Next stop...BBB.<//Review>

Pretty cool place. They have so many figurines. I happen to stop by there and its a very specific genre store. They even had people playing some board game in the backroom. They have many books on battles. Face masks are mandatory. It's a geeks paradise.< /Text>

<Name>Samantha< /Name><Review>A pretty fun and interesting place.

Has a bunch of options for board games, but is very heavily focused on DnD.

It's run by three very friendly older gentlemen. It has a bunch of cool DnD monsters decorating the walls in a backroom.

A must go for people just getting into, or are heavily into DnD.< /Review>< response>

Atrocious customer service. Just had another in a long line of poor experiences here. I came in to buy a number of D&D characters. When asking for assistance in locating models on their sparse and disorganized racks I was made to feel as if I was bothering the employee. No offer was made to order items they didn’t have in stock and when I asked if the model in the package looked damage (As I’m new to the game)  the snarky response was looks fine to me, you don’t have to buy if you don’t want to. I have always put up with their quirks as they are the local shop and I like to support local business but enough is enough.  I’ll miss perusing there dusty old shelves full of dated products but there is always Amazon.</text>

<Text>I don't know what the person below me is talking about. I've been coming here for years and never once have I had trouble with any employee treating me "snarky". The person below has left 1 star reviews for multiple long beach businesses so I wouldn't trust his word what so ever.

A selfish review like that really hurts businesses like these, and if you truly had a bad experience you should have handled it then are there, opposed to writing a "snarky" review after.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dd33f0d56f6553:0x36faa3e1500aea10</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I came in with a friend to buy some card sleeves and the person who rung us up was so rude that I simply ended up leaving. I've shopped here multiple times, but that was the worst experience I've ever had at any LGS.  I honestly think the guy was just trying to go back into the backroom and continue playing games with his buddies instead of answer our questions.  I love supporting local businesses, but I don't ever plan to go back.  They rolled the dice and it did not pass.< /review>

<text>Lots of variety. Current stock and stock from their 40+ year history, but the store feels a bit claustrophobic and could use better organization. If you've got time to hunt, though, you might find a hidden gem. Friendly staff! Prices are consistent with list price, but don't compare with online options. These stores are becoming a rarity!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Love this store! So glad I found it online. So worth the drive. The store is amazing. The young man when I called knew exactly what they had and super cordial. Highly recommend  for visiting lLong Beach area or if your willing to venture out of the Los Angeles so worth it. 5 stars!</review>

<review>Haven't been here in years, but the folks there (not all of them are employees) have a passion for games and adventure gaming. HUUUUUUUGE Selection on miniatures and environment set kits. Everything you need for table top RPGs...some of it dating back to the original D&D genre. Lots to find. Good guys.</review>< userid>

It was okay. Felt like I had walked onto a set  (think Goonies, Gremlins, or Stranger Things). A bit dusty and disheveled. If we had lots of time to rumage would have been fun. But we didn't.<//review>

<text>Great selection of new and older games. Helpful staff with a very knowledgeable owner. Literally thousands of board games, role playing games, card games, dice games, miniature war games, miniatures, dice, and gaming accessories for all types of gamers. The store is packed wall to wall, a definite must go and see. Especially if you like to see and feel before purchasing. The staff is happy to let you shop, look, and feel without pressure to buy. There is also in-store gaming of all sorts nearly everyday. Pathfinder and D&D on the weekends (even into the night), as well as card games (Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, etc), Star Wars X-Wing, and Hero Clix during the week. It is very local for those in Long Beach and the South Bay areas. Of course, since it is only 2 blocks off the Long Beach Freeway, it is pretty accessible to anyone in L.A., Orange, or San Bernardino Counties in California. They also do mail order and have an Ebay store for those not in the area. I cannot say enough good things about this store. They have been in business since 1974!!!< /text>< Gmap_id>

I have done 6 houses now with the toughlock vinyl flooring and I love it. Its easy to lay because its all in one and the tenants can't hurt it by mopping with water. It has a very high end look to it so you don't get the impression that it's a rental property.<//Text>

This business does not stand behind their warranties. They sold me engineered hardwood flooring for a high traffic kitchen/living area, representing it would last 25 years. Less than 6 years later, it looks awful. And they claim warranty does not apply, because it is "normal wear and tear." Total rip-poff!< /Text>

What an excellent experience and great flooring at a great price.  My experience was seamless from thr time i walked into the show room to the installation of my new carpet.  I will definitely be recommending them to family and friends.<//review>

Chico took my order while I had a flurry of activity and sounds going on behind me.  I am surprised he hung in there with me but he was professional, courteous and a good problem solver.  The CC company declined the charge even though we had plenty of credit and he helped me navigate through that mess. Gave me his cell to call back so I could get the order placed since it was now after hours.  THANK YOU CHICO!  I really needed to get the flooring ordered and you made it easy!< /review>

<review>We had a great experience with Flooring Liquidators in Fresno. After getting an incredibly overpriced quote from Lowe’s, FL helped us quickly and easily accomplish our goals (not the salesmen’s) of installing new carpet so we could sell our house.

The salesmen Chris was super professional and Robert the guy who measure the house was incredibly helpful, offering suggestions for how to accomplish our goals while saving on unnecessary upgrades.

We will definitely use them again in our new home. I highly recommend them<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1509396451186, 'text': 'Thank you very much. We appreciate your business.'}<//Resp>< GmapID>

The end result is cheap product and unfinished work by their subcontractor. Over estimate on products and cheap materials not the ones you see when you visit the store. They recycle your old stuff even though they quote that they will replace with new one. I highly recommend anyone not do any business with them.<//review>< pictures>

< review>
This place uses shady sales tactics. We went in looking for hardwood flooring. They added a LOT of square footage to my estimate and were dismissive when I asked them about it. I went back and measured everything myself to show them and suddenly they "lost" the diagram the estimator had drawn up. This place is also NOT a liquadator; they are just a regular old retailer. We needed just barely over 200 square feet of floor underlay and they were going to make us buy a full 300 square feet. If they were a real liquadator they would just sell the extra to someone else. And their claims to be lower priced than other places is complete garbage. We found the same stuff at Lowes for cheaper, with the same labor cost.< /review>

Great Mexican style nieveria(ice cream shop).  You can get fresh fruit with Chile and chamoy , milkshakes, ice cream cones, waffle bowls, and banana splits.  Try it you will not be disappointed.

Updating review 5-26-18.   Asked for a chamango especial.... Got a regular.  Informed the employee that I asked for an especial but she stated that I asked for a regular.  I asked my fiancee and he confirmed I said especial but employee acted like she didn't hear and didn't fix it.  Not a happy customer.  Hopefully a one time thing.... If not will not be coming back.<//text>

<review>The staff is not friendly at all they always have a longgggg face except for the blond she is always nice and doesn't  make u feel like she's giving you free ice cream.the owner is equally rude and the floor is dirty. They don't have Rocky road and my water melon was not as fresh. The chamango is 👌 though extra Limon is an issue they stingy with the lemon   . The restrooms is clean and the parking is ok I guess< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service 🤬🤬😡😡waiting 15 minutes to buy 2 snow cones the brats who work now are not good for work I worked there. Before and. Nothing to do with those who attend there. Grumpy girls and sheer chatter do not rush to. So Ligorio doña Martha get strict with each other, as they used to do with me and Tere and with gem, they wouldn't let us talk and we couldn't wait for people. We always. They brought little cuts

Atendernos así que Ligorio doña Martha ponganse extrictos con eyas como lo asían antes conmigo y con Tere y con gema no nos dejaban platicar y no podíamos asrr esperar ala gente. Siempre nos.

(Translated by Google) I served a terrible thing, I ordered a coconada and the boy fell silent on the floor, and that's how he served it to me, he thought he didn't look at it, and even so he served it to me, terrible service from him, be very careful, how they serve you no you have consideration for the client

(Original)
Pesimo servico, ordene una coconada y el muchacho se le callo al piso, y asi me lo sirvio, el penso que no lo mire, y aun asi me lo servicio, pesimo servicio por parte de el, tengan mucho cuidado, como te sirven no tienes consideracion para el cliente</Review>

<Date>1519363153113</Date><text>(Translated by Google) We parked in their space and went to eat tacos next door, the dude came outside running asking us to move. I said we were headed in there for ice cream, he ignored me completely and threatened to call the police. Seriously though its common sense, people go there after tacos.😐 it's pricier than other similar places in Madera.

The owner is very angry. Well the people who go to the tacos can also go there later but they don't want you to park on their side. The only reason they have customers is because of the taqueria next door. How selfish! and it is more expensive than other sides in Wood.

El dueno es muy enojon. Pues la gente que va a los tacos tambien puede ir ahi despues pero no quere que uno se parque en su lado. La unica razon que tiene clientes es por la taqueria a lado. Que egoista! y esta mas caro que otros lados en Madera.<//text>< pictures>

I have been to a few FoodMaxx stores in Bakersfield and out of town and each one is a completed shopping trip... They have good stock and selection sale items are usually available their French bread and rotisserie chicken are 2 of my favorites. Produce s is fresh stores are clean.. I only have one com plaint that is checking out usually a bit long.... actually one of my favorite stores because of the prices!!!!</Review>

FoodMaxx is my every week shopping grocery store. The prices are excellent and on my very tiny budget, I can really stretch my food shopping dollars. Produce is a great quality as I buy fresh every week and there are always good deals on meats and non perishables. It is within walking distance of my place and helps keep me in shape. I love the excellent staff who are truly helpful and extremely hard working. It's a great local market!< /text>

He is awesome. Very friendly and is careful with your groceries. He does not just scan and push or throw. He scans and places stuff carefully to the side. If he is there and has a longer line than the others I still get in his line.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Very clean, well lit inside and out. Staff is very helpful and I knowledgeable about the store. Even the security guard could tell you where to find items. Isles are nice and wide. Product selection is vast and lacking only in a better range and quality of generic products. There is no deli for things like fresh sandwiches and the regular prices of products are far above Walmart. Making it tough on a budget. However, their sales prices are very decent. All in all I'd give the Food Maxx at this location 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5. ★★★★<//Review>

My coupon was for 2 lb of strawberries but they were out. A guy from the meat dept went to produce and made sure I got my berries.  I got a3 lb pack as an apology. Everyone was pleasant even the other customers!  Will be 🔙 loved my food maxx visit.</Text>

<Text>I don't typically shop here its always too crowded and there's always something happening. Homeless people and people on drugs bombard you in the parking lot. There's always a huge line and only 2 or 3 cashiers open.<//Text>< rate>

I enjoy going to this store, all the employees acknowledge me because they have seen me so often. Which means they pay attention to what's going on. The variety of product is your average grocery store. The prices are pretty reasonable and their weekly sales ads are great. I wish they still did 24 hours a day but understand with the recent homelessness problem and them shoplifting at this store. Everytime I've gone in this week have witnessed it myself. They walk right out the front door with it.</Text>

Alright selection, alright prices. Pretty-much generically alright. Sales are often good, typically if you watch for the bulk mailer that comes about weekly. Not the best FoodMaxx in town, and definitely avoid going there the first few days of the month unless you enjoy check out lines.. But to be fair, all grocery stores have that issue.<//review>

<Text>It's gotten better because of the new white security guard the black and black woman never did anything I remember that two black kids walking in and stealing a 4 case of 24 beers and he let them walk out and the mexican cashier had to chase them but now he chased away the meth heads and help me load stuff in my taxi 🙂👌💯</Text>< response>

The cashier didn't present good customer service, he wasn't friendly at all. This applies to another staffer when asked where an item was he stated, "I don't know." I would not recommend this store nor will I ever go back.< /Review>

Terrible experience. Jason was our checker and had an attitude. We found coupons that just said meat on them so we put them on a different pack. There was nothing on the coupon that said we couldn’t do that. I asked Jason why, and he said “since you wanna complain I’m going to refund the meat and recharge you” my husband said absolutely not and we don’t want anything from the store after being treated that way. Annette, the manager didn’t have anything to say when we ended up getting a refund because we refused to deal with their horrible customer service. I won’t come back here again. They just lost customers over a $3 coupon. That’s sad. I feel discriminated against, as a group of white people coming in and being treated that way from an African American cashier. I guarantee if his buddies or family went in there and did that, he would’ve let them. We didn’t even think we were doing anything wrong. Sincerely, if we did we wouldn’t have done that. They assumed we were being sneaky, and that wasn’t the case at all. Very disappointed in this store and the people that work here. We saw a guy walking around stealing stuff and they were worried about us using a coupon... ridiculous.< /review>

<text>Foodmaxx was actually pretty good. Most locations would rate five stars with me. This location could stand some extra security.

<Text>This store always have long lines and only two check stands open. If you are only purchasing a few items it’s best you avoid this market. If you are passing by and happen across this store, don’t do as I did. Continue until you reach your own neighborhood  unfortunately every Foodmaxx I have visited pretty much has the same issues. Just avoid foodmaxx if you want to remain in a good mood.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Big trays of meat for $6-15. Each try last one person two or three days if you eat 2 or 3 pieces of meat a day. Many different cuts of pork, beef and shrimp 2 pounds is $12 right now. Mixed frozen seafood package with clams, squid, octopus, shrimp is $2.79. Rice-roni any flavor $.99 Frozen vegetables $1-$2 a bag each. Eat dinner like a king for one person every night for $150 a month.<//Review><gmapID>0x80ea6a2dbb18a2bb:0x1f6d29428951826c<//gmapID><user_name>Bradley Diaz<//user_name>< Date>

I love foodmax! Favorite place to shop. They have the more affordable prices not any store can beat in my opinion. Food is fresh. Maybe it's because they sell so much of their food idk. I definitely recommended the store to anyone.</review>

<review>Your prices are good,  Your staff is very friendly and helpful, but. When you have five or more people in a checkout line,  you should open up another checkout.  It's irritating when you only have two lines open, and you have people in line half the way back to the meat counter.  Thank you.< /review></record>

Great prices.. always shop there or one of the other food Maxx stores..only problem is that most of the registers are closed with only one or two open and the lines tend to get really really long..this is at most stores so I'm always curious why they can't open more when the lines are long</text>

This FoodMaxx is so ghetto. So many people hanging around in the parking lot.  Begging,  making deals, fighting, you never know what you might see going on . Prices are too high for this to be in a low income neighborhood.  I only go there if it's absolutely necessary.  I would never shop here on a regular basis.<//Review>

This is your typical neighborhood warehouse supermarket part of Albertsons food. They have weekly ad specials and great inventory on the shelves.</Text>

I like this foodmax, but if you go during the day from about 4pm to 9:30-@10pm, be prepared to wait in a long slowish line full of ALL KINDS of very random people. And you should probly have someone come with you, so that before your turn at the register comes up, your other person can run and bring your ice- cream,bags of ice,Popsicle's etc, and you can avoid a melted watery mess when you get home. Trust me.<//Review>

Foodmax needs more cashier workers. Everytime i go i have to wait in massive lines! Getting out of work late plus still standing in a line that hardly moves all the time kinda sucks!!!<//text>

Awful experience at night. Huge line.  And teams of thief's and beggers outside.  Your car will most likely get broken into.</text>

To pricey and the food max on union & California is in a bad area so I guess they get alot of shop lifters so the employees & security follow you around and they look at you like your their to rob I don't like it and I don't recomend it !< /Text>
