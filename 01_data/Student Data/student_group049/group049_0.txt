< Review>
I was blessed to find Mike & Val through a recommendation from Val's dad, Flo!!  Many years ago, we were both doing volunteer work at a food bank in Costa Mesa & I mentioned how hard it was for a female not to get ripped off getting her car fixed!  "Go see my son-in-law Mike", he said, "He is the best, most honest repair guy in Orange County.  He will take good care of you!"  He was right.  I never looked back & kept taking all my different cars (with their different issues!) to Mike from then on.  Always honest, always straight and fair, always trying to educate you about your repair so you know what they are doing & why!  Mike & Val make you feel like extended family.  Good good folks! Don't take your car anywhere else.😁👍< /Review>

Very knowledgeable & knowledge used solely to be helpful. Worked with me to save me a lot of money. Above & beyond service. Literally treated like family as a walk in. Couldn't hope to find a better auto shop.< /review>

<Review>Great service! Connected via yelp quote with quick replies. Brought in my car for new brakes and the job was done within 4 hours. Easy drop off and pick. Will come back again for future services. Pricy was extremely reasonable as well. Thanks!</Review>< pics>

<Text>I want to thank the professional staff and service. From the start Jacob Schneider guided me through the process of how the technicians assessed all aspects of any potential work. Everything was up front and honest which eased my mind as I had a road trip planned to Alabama and back. I am writing this review from Alabama and I am very happy to report that my 1997 Toyota Tundra purred all the way - I am confident that my return trip will be just as good 👍.  Thank you all - Val & Mike (& Jacob) you guys rock 🤘</Text>< time>

< Review>
I don’t typically leave reviews but I had to comment on the excellent service I received here. I came in for some odd engine noises and I couldn’t be happier with the quality, speed, and cost of the repairs. Some guy named Jake had my vehicle diagnosed immediately; I had the diagnosis along with cost of parts and labor within an hour.

Despite how busy they were, I was in and out fairly quickly. Nobody was trying to sell me extra wheels or services like most of the other places either. It’s been a few weeks now and my engine noise is no more.

I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a new honest mechanic. Thank you guys!</Review>

<text>These guys ran a diagnostic for me and saved me a lot of money on a repair by letting me know the repair I needed was covered under an extended warranty by the manufacturer, it was a transmission issue so it would have been expensive had they not gone out of their way to check for warranties for me, which was greatly appreciated!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<name>Jacklyn Garcia< /name><text>Professional, personable, and honest.  It's the auto shop that correlates to Cheers.  i.e. "Where everybody knows your name".  Family type of feel.  Jake is my 'go to' guy.  He's clear and concise on what I need, however, not pushy.  To simplify, he's not 'salesy'!  I feel like he tells me like it is.  If I decide to move forward, he's 'on' it.  If I delay until my finances permit, he says, "Just give me a call when you want the work done."  I've referred friends and family, and will continue to do so.  Thanks much Jake!  You rock!< /text><Response>None<//Response>< userid>

<Text>Outstanding value on all levels. The owner treats your car as if it’s his own. Even provides a loaner car if you need it. The service was impeccable.  Service for import cars typically puts a dent in the pocket, however I am happy to say that the service was appropriately priced.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

It's evident that the new owner cares not only about good business practice, but also the people he deals with. Pat made that very evident when I was not happy with something he personally called me to make it right. This place gets my recommendation.</text>

Love Val & Mike's - we bring all our cars here & I know I am being treated fairly- they in fact found nothing wrong with my father in law's car when another place said he needed $1500 worth of repairs!!  Nothing compares to the great customer service & Val's cheery personality< /Review>

If I could describe Val and Mike's Auto Repair in just one word I would choose FAMILY.  I felt so very welcomed from the first 2 steps when I walked in to the final steps when I left.  I felt reassured and was told exactly what they were going to do to my car and they told me if they needed to do any additional work that they would call me immediately before making any adjustments.  Very sweet people!  I definitely recommend them! Thanks guys! :)< /text>

Work done in a timely manor.  The service manager doesn’t recognize a long time customer.  I had to ask for AAA discount.  Never worried about that when Val or Mike was there.  But otherwise the car is working well.< /review>

<Review>Val & Mike's is awesome! Brought my car in not knowing what the problem was - they were very thoughtful and thorough in their diagnosis of the issue. Called me to explain what they'd done and the proposed repairs, gave me an estimate for the work up front when I dropped the car off and then also gave me the adjusted quote once they'd isolated the issue. Also did the work very quickly - I needed it back that same afternoon to get to work and they made sure it was done before then. So glad I took my car to them.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I having been taking my cars there for years. They are honest, ethical, and I trust them to not take advantage of my knowing very little about cars. That was extremely important to me when I was a single woman, because some places will take advantage of you. Not Val and Mike's! They don't try to upsell you. I always feel like they will take great care of me and my car and that is priceless! Such nice people, too!<//text>

You guys are great.  I drove in with minimal air conditioning, and an hour later, with awesome air conditioning.   My 2 doggies and I am very impressed.  Great, prompt service, at a fair price.  It doesn't get much better than that.  THANK YOU from Jane, Scarlett. and Dobie.
Customers for life.< /Text>

We have been going to Mike's Auto Service for many years.  A friend first recommended them to us, and we have never been disappointed.  They are not only good at what they do, they are ethical, honest, and always charge a fair price.  I could not go to anyone else because I totally trust them.  They provide a ride home or back to work if you need it.  AND they are just the nicest people on earth!  I recommended them with the highest recommendation possible.< /review>

I highly recommend Mike's Auto Service for auto repairs. Mike, Val and the staff were very personable and professional. John gave me a ride home while my car was being examined. Mike called to let me know what needed to be done and got my approval before proceeding. They called when the repairs were complete and sent John back out to get me and bring me back to the shop. The bill was very reasonable and I'm very satisfied with the work done. An all-around superior experience with Mike's Auto Service!< /Text>

<review>There invoice says Quality Service and Complete Satisfaction is there number 1 Goal, but we are NOT SATISFIED. My wife took our vehicle in as we had pink fluid leaking. Estimated cost was $213 in parts and $468 in labor at a total of $650 for replacing a upper radiator hose, lower radiator hose, power steering hose and thermostat. None of these problems fixed the problem that originally was pink fluid leaking. My wife picks the vehicle up to be told that they did not fix the leak and that we need to now have our Water pump replaced for another $450. The excuse they gave my wife is that they pressure washed the vehicle and could not tell where the leak was until she came that morning. All we wanted was our leak fixed correctly for the original $650. They offered to give us a free rental car. We wanted a better discount then the new cost of another $450 out of our pocket. We explained our dissatisfaction and that they would loose a customer that had been there previously before with no issues, yet that did not seem to matter to them. I am disappointed!!!< /review>< Pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1459453301543, 'text': 'We agree with you that your recent repair was not handled correctly and we apologize for the mishandling of the coolant leak diagnosis. As you documented above, the pink fluid findings were coming from the power steering hose and red coolant was detected from the hoses and thermostat.  Unfortunately, after the repairs were done and the vehicle re-pressure tested, there was no evidence at that time that the water pump failed until only after we test drove it. Definitely we understand and appreciate the frustration you experienced and agree with you that we could have worked with you to provide you with the quality service and complete satisfaction that you expected.  Though we understand the stance our Service Advisor Mike Burley took when estimating the water pump repair, we did explain to him that under the circumstances you did warrant a reasonable discount.  We appreciate your time speaking with us and accepting a refund for the diagnostic and thermostat repair. We hope this gesture demonstrates that we are a business that truly cares for our customers and stands behind our work. Again, thank you for bringing this incident to our attention so we are able to improve our business practices.  Val & Mike'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

As usual, Val & Mike's Auto fixed my 15 year old Explorer.  The radiator cracked which means I had no A/C and  that is vital to my comfort.  They got me fixed up within 24 hours and also offer a discount with Enterprise for a rental.  Val & Mike has been keeping my vehicle in great shape for several years.   They are also conveniently located in my area.  Thanks to Val, Mike and Mike.<//text>

As Usual!!! The team at Val & Mike's  service our company fleet and keep us on the road.  I feel confident when I pick up a truck that there are no issues that will pop up down the road.  So I shouldn't say as usual I should say " AS AMAZING!!!"</review>

<Text>Not happy this time at all!  I brought the car in at 9:20 in the morning for an oil change.  Mike, the owner, told me my car could be picked up in the early afternoon hours.  At 3 o'clock, the  other Mike called me with all sorts of recommended repairs, inluding a turn signal bulb exchange, which he quoted me $40-$60 for exchanging a $4 bulb.  I authorized a transmission service, which was supposed to take 1.5 hours.  At 5 o'clock, I still had not heard from them.  (Later I discovered a missed call from them and a voicemail at 4:50.  I called back at 5:10.)  When I asked for a ride to pick up my car, the other Mike told me that everyone was gone and nobody could give me a ride.  He parked the car on the street, as I told him that I would have to walk for about an hour to get there.  Not very good customer service!  I had hoped to pick up the car shortly after noon, not shortly after dark!<//Text><gmapID>0x80dd26925ff0de87:0x9b27005ae144f555< /gmapID></record>

<text>I've been a big fan of Val and Mike's for nearly fifteen years, starting when the Honda dealer told me I needed a $1600 head gasket and Mike fixed my overheating problem with a new hose for $85.

Later, I depended on them to keep our daughter’s car safe when she was a student in San Francisco. Wherever they fixed something, it was always done right and stayed fixed.  And with our daughter 400 miles away, that peace of mind was priceless.

Just last week they replaced suspension parts on my Prius and replaced the brakes on my daughter’s aging VW Rabbit with the same care and expertise as always. Finding the right mechanic is like finding the right doctor or plumber, and we definitely found ours.  With competence, integrity and reasonable prices, Val and Mike's is the complete package!<//text><rate>5<//rate><time>1602712435768< /time></record></dataset><record>

They are good with the basic stuff only. I brought my car to them three times for the same problem, to fix the brakes, and until now I hear squeaking sounds. I paid over a $1100 for nothing. I don't recommend this place.< /text>

<Review>Customer service is top notch here! Val made the process so easy for me. I was pressed for time and she made it happen rather than me ignoring my flashing maintenance light for another week. My car is 9 years old and it was running like a 9-year-old car. Now my baby is running like a champ, the air-conditioner is working optimally again and my new brakes are keeping me safe and sound on those sudden stops that gave me anxiety before. I was astonished when I received a follow-up call to see how everything was going since they've worked on my car. That is an absolute first. I couldn't be more pleased with everything. Thanks Val, Mike, Little Mike and crew for taking care of my baby!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Let me give praises to Mike for solving my CEL (check engine light) problem. My OBD computer gave me P0174 & P0330, faulty O2 sensor & knock sensors replacement. Mike's Auto also came up with same computer diagnostic readings.

I replaced 2 of 3 O2 sensors myself. The third sensor was seized, which I couldn't remove with my tools & lubricating spray. Toyota of HB wanted to replace the entire exhaust manifold. That was unacceptable with a $2000 quote. Mike's auto has the knowledge & tools to remove the seized sensor, thus saving me $2K. I supplied the sensor & paid a fair labor charge.

I already knew the knock sensors replacement would be the expensive part b/c it is labor-intensive. Based on what I researched, Mike's quote was fair. Based on what I've read on Yelp & on the company's website, I felt comfortable giving them my business.

I waited almost 3 weeks to write this review to make sure that my 2002 Toyota Highlander was running fine, & it is. It has 185K miles, & I would like it to last 300K & beyond, if possible. I also have a 1998 Toyota Camry with 250K miles & will bring it to Mike's for 255K service.< /review>

Your original timing belt broke.  I see per your comment above that you came back with problems, but we do not have any records that you returned after the initial repair and have not been in since.  As most of our customers know, Mike and I are always available even after hours to discuss any questions or concerns on repairs that we perform.  Our goal is to keep our customers safe with quality work and customer service.  If you would like to contact either Mike or I regarding your repair from 7 years ago, we would be happy to talk to you,  to see exactly what your experience was and see how we can help you today.  Thank you and we look forward to talking to you.  Val'}<//response>< gmap_id>

This place was such a disappointment... My son and I went there thinking we'd find some great things to buy, but left empty handed. Not only were their things basically all the same but over priced as well. Definitely not worth the stop.</Review>

A collection of small shops and business alongside Van Nuys Blvd from Hamlin down to Gimore though actually extending down to Victory with mostly clothing, essential items, electronics and travel accessories. There is street parking all throughout the area.<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I was referred North Tustin Veternary Clinic by a clinic that could fulfill a same day appointment with me and my buddy Merlin. So I called North Tustin Clinic and not only where more than happy to finally help me and my buddy in our situation after the appointment that I didn't think was going to happen they gave me a 50 % discount on the total balance!!! Man this clinic and all its staff are really amazing! They even let me use the restroom! Lol wow saved my hide twice!!! I am excited to continue take Merlin to visit. I would definitely refer this clinic to anyone. Thank you so much North Tustin Veterinarian for all your help and me and Merlin send our love.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I adopted my first pup on 5/7. Luckily, I was able to get her in for an appointment within the same week. The staff is very friendly and has continued to answer and provide answers for the many questions that I have had. The doctor was very informative during our first wellness exam. She introduced new/alternative training methods, as needed, and extended an offering for me to reach out to her for any additional training tips I may need in the future.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Look at this healthy happy pup! She loves this clinic! The vets and vet assistants are so sweet, quick & the facility is clean. Dog treats are sometimes available if it’s not a busy day🤗🐶</text>

<Review>My cat Tippy was acting sick, lethargic, stopped eating.  He began coughing, and snorting his food... right away he was examined and diagnosed with pancreatic inflammation, was in the clinic for two whole days... he is now home recovering and so much better.  The Vet and her team were VERY caring, communicative and kind to Tippy.  He seemed content and I feel confident in their expertise. Thanks to all at North Tustin Vet Clinic!< /Review>< Pictures>

They were super helpful with my cat. I was able to get a cancellation appointment so I could come in sooner. They are very caring and I would definitely recommend them to others.< /Text>

Brought my pitbull, Gracie, in for a second opinion on her limping and not being able to put much weight on her front right leg. I had X-rays from another vet, pet point, that they looked at. Dr. Seggermann at North Tustin veterinary recommended some new radiographs and determined that Gracie was suffering from one of two things. The medical director, Dr. Seggermann, referred me to another specialist but in the meantime took a comprehensive blood panel and ruled out one of the two things it could be. Dr. Seggermann and staff are very kind, caring, polite, engaging, and professional as I had to make the very difficult decision to put Gracie down due to the diagnosis. Dr. Seggermann and the staff there go above and beyond their duty.</text>

<review>Dr. Cobian saved our cat’s life by diagnosing him correctly when he was misdiagnosed at a different vet, and our cat who usually hates the vet loves Dr. Seggermann! She was able to draw blood while he was calmly sitting in her lap which I have never seen anyone do before. Everyone is very nice here and the office staff is organized.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Dr. Seggermann is terrific--she's a real problem-solver, actually cares what happens to the "kids," and works to find a way to make care work for them, and for you. She has been a tremendous asset since joining this team, and my pup thanks her.</review>

Even as we are shut down for co-vid, they were open for curbside dropoff and pickup. I had previously call them and had a conversation about my dog. We agreed on a plan and the price was great.
Along with the great price was a very understanding staff. I was treated with warmth and courtesy.
When I dropped my dog off, the handler was very nice and made my dog very relaxed.

Well done Wagly.<//text>

<Text>I have been a customer at NTVC for almost 6 years now, and if I can give Dr Kali 10 stars it won't be even enough.  He loves the animals like they are his own.  Very knowledgeable and professional.  As soon as he examine a dog, he knows what is going on, at simply looking at them, no need for tests.  He just runs tests just to follow protocols. He just ""FEELS"" with his gentle touch, it is almost like the dog talks to him.  It is simply incredible. Their prices are very affordable as well.
I thought my boy Presley was gravely ill, but thank God he is fine, just take a medicine all his life now, which I don't mind.  And he is doing better.
I will never ever think of changing Dr Kali.  He is a life savior and simply honest.  Thank you Dr Kali for your care and love.  If I can give more than 5 stars, I would.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We brought our rescue Husky, Megan, in for a well doggy visit and to make sure we are giving her the best treatment for her hip displaysia and epilepsy. The doctor went over her treatment plan with us and made a few suggestions which we have incorporated into her routine. We look forward to a long relationship with NTVC.

<review>I was very much in favor of this place until the vets (not Dr. Kali) misdiagnosed my animals, both times which led to them dying. First, the vet said my dog had an ulcer when she was poisoned, even though I told him I believed she had been poisoned. The following day I brought her back, only to be referred to an emergency clinic, where she died. If she had been diagnosed correctly in the first place, she may have lived. This week, I brought in a small kitten who was very weak. They said he just had roundworms and would be fine. She was not. I brought him back after a day and a half, with the same symptoms, and Dr. Kail said that there was nothing he could do at that point and he needed to be put down. Both times it was very important that they be diagnosed correctly, and both times they died because of a mediocre vet did not know what he or she was doing. I need a vet to be competent and not fob me off because they are inept at their job. I can no longer recommend anyone go  here as I do not trust the vets at this office.<//review>< pictures>

<userid>102118369851421533797</userid><text>One word to describe North Tustin Vet: compassionate!

My boxer ate a pacifier a few weeks ago so i decided to take him for an exam.  Dr. Kumar and his team were straight to the point gave me my options with out making me feel guilty about my dogs health.  A few hours later, they successfully removed the pacifier from my dogs stomach.   They even went above and beyond and stayed with him after hours to make sure he was stable.  This was by far one of the scariest things i have ever experienced, but this clinic/hospital made me feel as if i were a part of their family, as if Bentley was theirs.  They have also been my other dogs vets in the past, and i will never stop going here.

Thank you North Tustin Vet!< /text><response>{'time': 1568203167497, 'text': 'Thank you so much for taking the time to review our Practice!

< review>
Due to the sheer volume of fake 5 star reviews, the highest grade I ever give the best service is 4 stars.

Visiting a vet rates on the list of preferred activities just below getting a root canal.   I hate how many vets leverage your predicament to their financial gain.   To my amazement, after visiting many clinics over the years, this clinic restored my faith in humanity.  The cost was never mentioned until we were ready to leave, and was so low I felt a tad guilty as if I cheated them.  The receptionist did mention half price of normal cost for first visit, but even if the cost for visit, after deducting cost of medicine, it still would have been a bargain, even compared to those so called "discount" clinics, none of which I will identify by name.  To summarize, we didn't feel as if we were haggling over the purchase price of car, what a relief.

Another interesting theme with this business is the women, and I will not mention her name due to the fact that most reviews praising individuals by name were left by that person, the tall women really and truly loves cats.   She mentioned having 5 herself.   You can see a marked difference in the cat's willingness to cooperate, especially given the vet's patience, sympathy, and knowledge.  The woman really was a champ.   I'm not looking forward to a returning visit, but if I do suddenly need to take my cat to the vet, this place is certainly my choice of preference.

There you have my two cents, take it for what it's worth.<//review>

<Text>They were able to get us in on a Sunday, they were awesome, ran like a well oiled machine. The process was simple, efficient, informative... We are moving our other pets over here too. We loved where we were but this was that good of an experience.

We love every doctor there, Kate Moore is super and a great addition. This is our #1 go to vet.<//Text>< user>

< Review>
Originally came here for my guinea pigs years ago and they seemed very compassionate. Recently however, I brought two rats for a check up since one sporadically died the day prior. Two days after seeing the vet and getting an all clear, my second of three rats dies. They took xrays and said he was okay but he continued to lay on his back and barely move until passing away while I was at work. He was still eating and drinking normally. I feel very misled. Caution beware to those with their pets!!<//Review>

<Review>Dr. Kali has been our little Yorkshire Terrier's veterinarian for the past 13 years, though we had been bringing our small exotic pets to North Tustin Veterinary Clinic for several years prior. Dr Kali is very kind, gentle, and compassionate; it is obvious that he genuinely cares for the animals under his care (as well as their families!). Though his practice has grown so much over the past two decades, Dr. Kali and his team are always willing and able to make time to connect with the pets and their families. I cannot recommend North Tustin Veterinary Clinic highly enough. We were incredibly lucky to have found such a caring vet and team to take care of our beloved pet.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1531016944458, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words.

<Review>Our poor little duck got his leg hold, tugged, and horribly maimed buy a raccoon in his cage. Our vet at North Tustin veterinary in clinic was awesome. Not only did she take the time to talk to us and explain everything to us, but was so friendly and knowledgeable. I'm so happy we found this place!< /Review>< pictures>

We have taken all our dogs there for years and, over time, have seen all the vets. Every one of them has been gentle, thorough, professional, and knowledgeable. When we have had to say goodbye to a couple of our beloved pets, they could not have been more compassionate. In addition to wonderful vets, the office staff is also fantastic. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone who cares about their pets.< /text>

Had to bring my dog in because of allergies. I was able to call in on Sunday morning and get a same day appointment. They were busy, so I waited about 25 min after my appointment time, but I was grateful they were even able to fit me in so soon so it's fine. At the end of our appointment my hands were full, so I told the girl upfront I was going to bring my dog to the car first while she grabs the medicine. As I am putting my dog in the car she comes out with the medication :D so nice of her. My first time at this vet, 5 stars for fitting me in on a busy Sunday and going above and beyond to hand me my dogs meds. Thank you!<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>The doctor kept suggesting for me to put down my dog as the best option. That's mainly the only medical advice I got from them. With only a blood test, ultra sound, and xrays they came to the conclusion she had liver and kidney disease without doing a biopsy to narrow down the true cause. Luckily I got a second opinion elsewhere and she's back to her old self. I wonder how many other owners listened and put there dog down. Don't come here.< /text></record></dataset><record>

This vet clinic is awesome!  I researched various vets in the area, and it had fabulous reviews, so I went to check it out.  My cat had a scratched eye.  As a new client, I got 50% my first office visit.  The clinic isn't a large office, but you get great care with reasonable prices!  The office was exceptionally clean and didn't have the usual vet odor. The vet took her time with Misty, explained her injury, and informed me about everything before conducting any additional testing, which would be my choice. She left with some eye drops and a conehead, but her eye was healed within a week.  The vet even called me during the week to see how she was doing.  I went for a week check-up to make sure she had healed okay.  The vet also called again that week to make sure she was well.  I highly recommend you visit the North Tustin Veterinary Clinic.  Your pet will be taken care of and happier because you went there.  This will now be my family vet!<//Text>

I have used many vets over the years, but none as good as Dr. Wentworth. She truly, truly cares about your pet(s) and is very honest with all options and costs. She enjoys her job and it shows.  She has a very warm bedside manner for clients and animals that makes you feel supported in tough times. We are lucky to have her in Tustin!<//Review>

I wish I could give you the full story but just check their yelp for it. They stole our muzzle, couldn’t confirm if they had put stitches in her or not, didn’t bother to check her incision site or chart to confirm, and told us to go to a different vet. They did this all in the waiting room, even though I had made an appointment. Never saw a doctor, never got answers, never got our muzzle back. Seems like they just took our money and ran.<//Text>

I will return to this location for every check up. Great service, clean office and great prices.  You get what you pay for:  For all the people saying they are expensive, when they need to do alot of tests and work, yes it will be expensive. My bill was beyond reasonable and i would have gladly have paid more because of the level of service I received 10 out of 10 they take care of your pet</Text>

This vet clinic is awesome!  I researched various vets in the area, and it had fabulous reviews, so I went to check it out.  My cat had a scratched eye.  As a new client, I got 50% my first office visit.  The clinic isn't a large office, but you get great care with reasonable prices!  The office was exceptionally clean and didn't have the usual vet odor. The vet took her time with Misty, explained her injury, and informed me about everything before conducting any additional testing, which would be my choice. She left with some eye drops and a conehead, but her eye was healed within a week.  The vet even called me during the week to see how she was doing.  I went for a week check-up to make sure she had healed okay.  The vet also called again that week to make sure she was well.  I highly recommend you visit the North Tustin Veterinary Clinic.  Your pet will be taken care of and happier because you went there.  This will now be my family vet!</text>

<Text>I had been taking my girl Abbey to Dr. Kali for some time. Over the years Dr. Kali has not only treated my girl with the utmost professional care. But he was so thoughtful and caring to me. After 16 years I had to make that difficult decision to let Abbey go. The entire staff and Dr. Kali were so caring and allowed us to take all the time we needed.to say our goodbyes. After a week I went to pick my girl up. I was so grateful to see how lovely they treated her remains. A nicely cedar box with a forever paw print and even a cutting of her hair. I would highly recommend.Tustin Vetninary Clinic. The entire office is wonderful. Thank you.

<Text>All the Vets and staff here are great and truly care about you and your pet. They have always been very accomidating. Recently we needed care to remove a cyst off of our dog. Everyone was very helpfull with and straight foward with cost - everything needed was explained well. I never felt coerced into anything. They were also very helpfull with getting all the paperwork sent to have our doggy health insurence coverage reimbursement. I appriciate they always have the best interest of Lexy (our German Shepherd) in mind and tell us what we needed and guide us in what we dont, and honest about it too. They are aways willing to work with you. I heard other places upcharge for same-day appointments, when I asked the staff about that they were surprised - they never do that there. In fact, when Lexy got conjuctivitis they even made time early in the morning for her, they asked "can you bring her in now" just because they were concered too. The're are lots of options for Vet care but they are the ones I trust with our puppy's health. Highly recomend!!<//Text>< Rating>

I adopted my dog from Friends of Orange County's Homeless Pets (FOCHP) and inherited this vet clinic since they partner with FOCHP to treat the animals they are trying to place.  I enjoyed their clinic so I decided to keep going.  5 years later and I am still a customer.  EVERYONE (staff and doctors) has always treated me and my dog with kindness, care and compassion.  Dr. Wentworth and Dr. Kali take their time examining and explaining what is happening with my dog...I get the sense that they genuinely care about her well being.<//text>

< review>
Took my rescue kitty here for his free exam. Dr. Wentworth was so awesome! I didn't feel rushed at all. She prescribed some medicine and even had them put a little extra in there incase the cat spit some out. Way to think ahead. She also gave some great food suggestions as we think he might have an allergy to the Iams dry food I was feeding him (he was itching and grooming excessively.) I also called around all the local vets before this visit and their office visit price was the best around. Prices for services were comparable or better than other local places too. The free first exam for a rescue, the prices, the recommendation from a neighbor, and the yelp ratings all lead to me choosing this vet.< /review>

Very elegant and convenient restaurant. They offer generous meals and for fair prices. We enjoyed the meals a lot and the staff were super personal and chatty. Will definitely recommend this restaurant.<//Text>

I love all of this stuff. It's kinda tucked off the main road. Rolled ice cream is awesome and all the treats have fruit so you can half convince yourself it's healthy and your not just indulging in some delicious Mexican candy flavor.< /review>

<Review>Horrible customer service! I ordered frito boat, they didn't even have Frito's. I then hesitantly ordered chilli dog & bacon dog. 20 minutes later, was informed they were out of buns & were going to go to the store really quick! After they returned, waited another 5-10minutes & was given wrong order of 'hot dog'! Then when asked if they could fix it, they just poured chilli beans over the mistake! When i waited to speak w/ someone to comp my issues, the 'original help' made sure he wasn't in the front to get told anything! NEVER AGAIN Will I waste time, gas, or money on this 'Shack'!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x8094fb43b11b75eb:0xad7b3003c9b42977<//gmap_id></record>

<Time>1588488237404< /Time><pics>None< /pics><userid>103704374185473451611</userid><review>I only gave this place a 4 because there's one thing that stopped me from giving it a 5 star rating. The reason being an employee named Mario. My grandaughter and daughter had been telling me how great this place was so this past Weds 04/29/20 a few of us went from Reedley to Parlier there was a very nice girl working there but this guy walks in while we are waiting he walked in and out i figured he was the owner because he walked in did something in the back then walked out but it wasnt the owner it was one of the employees. This guy was so rude!  The Mangoneadas were great! So we went back on Thurs and the nice girl wasnt working it was the guy from day before so we had a different experience the fat guy with the man bun. the employee's  name is mario he was very rude to us again but we overlooked and went back on friday because my daughter wanted to go again so we went hoping he wasnt there when i walked in it was a girl and another guy  and i was so happy mario wasnt there it was a lil after 5 well low and behold who walks in mario and once again was rude to us right about about 4 mins after he got there. During this time of quarantine most people are barely gettin by or workin hard for there money but we choose to go to these places to support them during this time when small businesses are struggling, then we go there just to be treated very rudely. an employee with this type of attitude and horrible customer service skils can cause the business to lose customers because there is many other  places to go to such as aqua pura, la plazita and mundo de sabores in reedley but we chose to try cali's and not once but 3 times 3 days in a row this boy was rude to us. Let me give you advice mario be careful with your bad attitude and horrible customer service skills because you might be rude to the wrong person and one day you might go for a job interview and one of those customers you were so rude to might be interviewing you. So unless you plan to spend the rest of your adult life working there at Cali's you better start being nicer and respectful to the customers. Dont be so rude and disrespectul to people that are supporting the business that help pay your wages remember without alot of customers and business you wouldn't have a job. Learn to respect others and be nice especially when ther elders. One last thing i do have to say is thank you to the girl and the guy that wer there those other days thank you for being so kind we appreciate it. You both have great customer service skills. For the record though this place deserves a 5 star for there food.<//review>< response>

<Review>Extremely rude staff with mean nasty attitudes. Piña colada was flavorless, couldn’t taste the coconut and the drink came with no cherry on top like it says on the advertisement. While being there, multiple customers went in and left as soon as they came in because of how rude and unprofessional the staff were. For my Mexican people, DO NOT COME HERE. Don’t waste your money. Disgusting.</Review><response>None<//response><userid>111606257040112554266</userid>< username>

Menu is kind of hard to navigate because of so many pictures and items were intermingled deserts with food items.  The prices are very reasonable! It's a small place 12 seats inside and 8 outside but the tiny space is decorated nice.  Overall; I will return and would recommend this establishment!< /review>< Time>

Rude staff. I ordered strawberry dreams over the phone and also wanted the rolled ice cream but they told me I couldn't order ice cream over the phone and had to order that upon arrival, so I only ordered my strawberry dreams. When I got there to pick up my order they said if I put in the ice cream order that it would go to the back of the line (another 30 minutes) which is dumb because they don't let you order it over the phone and tell you to come order inside, but then when you get there and order it you have to still wait another 30 minutes to get the second half of your order. I then told them if I could get hot cheetos with cheese ( they usually put my cheese in a container) and they didn't even want to do that. They told me that I also had to go to the back of the line to literally just put cheese in my container.

Anyways, not the first time I've gone to this place, it is very under staffed, wait times are ridiculous,  and staff is rude.</review>

Wished they had more help. Every time I go there’s a big line out the door and there’s only one worker, wait time is 20-40 mins. I see many people who wait in like and then walk out because of the wait time. Also the products that come out you can tell are made in a hurry. Hoping they get more help soon as their pineapples, mongonadas and strawberry dreams are very good.< /Review>

Sometimes the food is delicious, but the most times ive been there the food was barely okay, or smetimes bitter, the teenagers there make the pina coladas a  bit sour,
straberry delight a little empty with the straberies weird ,  and forget the granolla thing at times
the nachos most times than not are great, but i recieved them more thn once  cold
snack attack and hot dogs are okay
tostilocos are okay
pineapple parradise is amazing most of the times
ive tried every single thing in the menu i believe, and take notice on who does the food perfect and who does not, so far only one person has me set and i think thats the female owner, the teenagers there dont do very much of  a good job
the display however is phenomenal
i recommend having a few of the employees improve< /text>

<Review>Don't let the location fool you. This place can compete with the best of downtown. Ordered the Chef's Choice Sashimi Dinner. Wish I tried more of the menu. May have gotten lucky but much of it was premium cuts. Firm fish cut correctly. Rice was cooked right, firm without mushiness or water. Place was busy for a Thursday dinner service. Wait staff was very kind and attentive. Locals love this place.</Review>< Pics>

Food came out fast, but tasted very bland. And they only have sashimi, and not sushi on the weekdays. It's bizzare that a Japanese restaurant wouldn't have sushi everyday. It should be posted on the door. We only stayed because we were seated and didn't want to be rude. Also took 15 minutes to get water. I asked a waitress a question and she tucked her head down and ignored me. I wouldn't go back.< /Text>

Best sushi I have had for a really reasonable price. The rice was soft and fresh. The portions were decently large. They didn't skimp on the fish. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and the New York roll. Best smoked salmon and cream cheese roll. Their wasabi tasted fresh and strong.
I can't say much to their service as I ordered out, but it's a small place that looks comfortable.
I look forward to trying out more of their sushi.< /Text>

Came in for a quick lunch, since I was having stomach issues and wanted some plain rice. Also ended up ordering some miso soup and some vegetarian rolls. Service was fairly quick, but the wait staff was contrary; one was friendly, the other one was pushy and impatient; guess which one served me. First time in a while I've felt rushed and unwelcome.<//text>

Seated immediately. Courteous staff. Clean restrooms. Reasonably priced. No standout dishes that I tried, but my companion says the spider roll is top notch.< /Review>

My friends and I come here often as it is close by to us. The service is great, staff is friendly and food is good. The place is priced just right. Overall, great value, I recommend the Katsu Curry when they have it, large portion at a great price.< /Text>

Made reservation for the dinner, but still waited in the door for 10+ minutes, not because it's crowded ( I can see the seats were reserved). After we finally set in the table, we had another 20+ minutes wait for the order, no body seems care about us, so we left. I felt the restaurant was treating us as the beggars to beg their food. Eating in a restaurant suppose to be a happy time, but instead being treated badly, and suffered a lot of disappointments.< /review>

I had been here so many years and so many times. The food is good and the price is ok. After old owner, waiters, and waitresses left and no longer work there except one waitress remaining she is good waitress. Not long ago they hired a new waitress she is so mean and rude and unhappy person. Whenever the time for it to be closed and customer still eating at their table she is making loud noise, start banding the table, vacuum, pushing customer to get out. I don't think she is a right person for the job. I think that is one of the reason they're been losen customer a lot not because their food.< /text>

However, both the freshness and the quality of the sushi is excellent, I have never had better sushi anywhere else. Their non-sushi items are also quite delicious, including ramen and baked entrees. Our server was also quite friendly and very helpful in explaining what different unfamiliar items were. I would definitely want to eat here again, but I'd have to reserve some extra time for the wait.</text>< Pics>

<review>Just ordered 2 dinners to go and it took way too long.  From the time of the call to actually receiving the food was 45 minutes!  They give priority to seated guests and not take out orders.  Felt like they did not start the order until I got there and paid for it.  So I was just standing there for 25 minutes until it was done.  And they forgot to put the sauce on the side, so it took another 5 minutes to get that.  Not recommended unless you have oodles of time to waste.<//review><Time>1484450408637<//Time>< Resp>

Went for sushi on a whim, was given a menu and seated, took a few minutes  , was given tea and then when I ordered sushi was told they don't serve sushi. But it's in the lunch menu over half the right page and then was told only on certain days and left as they didn't seem want to serve sushi at said eatery.<//review>

I've been going to Yuki for over 10 years now (they didn't start at this location).  The food has always been awesome, hands down the best fresh sushi (read nigiri and sashimi)  I've had in this area or pretty much anywhere else for that matter.

Where they fall short is on the service side.  They're very busy and the waiters are always rushing back and forth but you usually have to ask to get your tea refilled and orders frequently don't arrive at the same time (or even close together).

I'm a die hard fan of the food though and will continue to go but I do wish they'd hire more help for the floor, even if it's temp to get through the busy periods.<//Text>

One of the best places to go to for fresh anything really :) I love going here for their sushi, combinations, and udon!

They're only open from Tuesday to Saturday, they close Monday and Sunday. I would always recommend getting their sushi because it's really fresh! The restaurant is authentic japanese and they really care about the quality of their fish which is why the food here is delicious.

Some of my favorite dishes are:

Nabeyaki Udon: The flavor of their broth is amazing. It's sweet but savory and there is just a ton of flavor. The Udon size is small but they pack it with a lot of stuff! The noodles were nice and chewy and I also like the tempura that comes with it because I think they make really good tempura!

Grilled Mackerel/Saba: They make really tasty fish. They grill and smoke the fish so you can taste that smoky flavor which makes their fish so delicious.

Ginger Beef: This is one of my favorite dishes to get in the dinner or lunch combinations. The beef is really tender and full of flavor. The beef is thinly sliced and sits on top of a sizzling platter!

Sushi: I can't remember all the different sushi i got here but I remember them being really good and fresh.

They always have daily specials on the white board near the sushi bar so look out of those because there always some really good things on there! The wait can get pretty long because there isn't too many seating but it's cute small restaurant.</review>

<Review>I'm certainly not an expert on Japanese food, but this place definitely smacks of authenticism, and the tamagoyaki (which I had never had before) was really excellent.   Definitely met my "jiro dreams of sushi" induced expectations of how good sushi can be.  also, for business travelers, the only one of five sushi places in the Fremont area I tried who actually takes american express.< /Review>< Resp>

Yuki is one of only a couple of authentic, Japanese-Japanese restaurants in Fremont. It often gets low marks on certain review sites because people go in expecting Crazy Super Gonzo Rolls and they throw a fit when they don't get them. Well, too bad. It's not that kind of place. Here you will find Japanese home-cooking-style dishes (nabe, croquettes, etc.), basic but good sushi (nigiri and maki), basic but good sashimi, a very short selection of California-style sushi rolls, and a handful of unfussy fusion items because, as the Japanese friend who introduced it to us said, "the chef likes to experiment." Their Cali-style items are actually pretty good; they smoke their own salmon, as I recall, so the smoked salmon and cream cheese roll is unreasonably delicious. Their mackerel is excellent and it's the first place I ever really liked it. Ramen is not a specialty, though; I would get that somewhere else.

Service can be slow. Prices are fair; combination meals are pretty large.

Adjust your expectations and you will have the best Japanese eating experience in Fremont. If all you want is multi-colored rolls with lots of sauces, though--and I admit those can be tasty--please go somewhere else.</Review>

The staff were extremely knowledgeable, personable, and very helpful. They kept me informed of the progress of the work on my vehicle every step of the way. They kept me updated as additional items were identified and interacted with the insurance company directly on my behalf. The customer service providers was exceptional!</review>

<text>I will be taking my car to them hopefully this following Monday but I just wanted to say that they have excellent customer service. I spoke with Maria about the damages to my car and she quickly came outside to review it. I'm going through with the insurance so if anyone wants to know, yes they work with insurances. I will edit this once the car is repaired to show before and after pictures of my vehicle.
Edit: So this is the update, I just wanna give a huge thanks to Network Autobody for repairing my vehicle, new trunk and bumper, bumper cover and impact bar. The paint came out even better than factory! Thank you to the staff for such great communication and an easy process, shout out to the people I had contact with: Maria, Anthony, Fabian, Erik and Ernie. Best customer service ever!</text>< Pictures>

These people are sociopathic cheaters and crooks. DO NOT trust them with your vehicle!

They picked up my brand new Jeep for body repairs after it was smashed into while it was parked. I had already been told by a previous shop the frame was bent and the insurance was going to claim it a total loss but I decided to get a second opinion (I loved this Jeep) and “lo and behold” when Network Auto Body (NAB) got a hold of it, suddenly, it’s fine, just needs 13k in body and paint work which, of course the insurance was covering in full.

2 months later when I went to pick up the vehicle (they didn’t even offer me a ride, those cheapskates) I looked at the underbody and the bumper was on crooked!

I immediately asked why the staff started to obviously panic and say they had to call the manager, Richard, who was not available, blah, blah, blah…

When he finally appeared since I started a scene, he back paddled really fast and said the car wasn’t ready yet and I shouldn’t have been notified that it was.

A few days later, I again was called to pick up the car, I again looked under the body and although much less, the bumper was still crooked. I knew what was happening and I started the accusations flying “YOU FIXED MY CAR ON A CROOKED FRAME!”

Yup, in fact they did and, they knew it, and they had not a glitch of conscience about giving it back to me that way, regardless of how dangerous this might be.

Of course, I took the car back to the original mechanic and contacted the Bureau of Automotive repair who wrote a lengthy report on how they “admittedly made a mistake, ooops”. NAB offered to pay me $250 for the mistaken frame report as long as I was willing to sign a waiver I wouldn’t sue them.

The worst part of all; THEY PUT A STACK OF WASHERS ON ONE SIDE OF THE BUMPER, TRYING TO EVEN IT OUT SO I WOULDN’T NOTICE THE STILL BENT FRAME!!!!!!!!! (see picture)

Turns out, many shops do this deceptive and crooked practice because they fear the insurance company declaring the car a total loss if the frame is in fact bent and then they lose the job.

Besides this travesty of an act, they were rude and careless. The paint had lint in it and the soft top was scratched and damaged from sitting in the shop unprotected.

I DO NOT RECOMMENT THIS BODY SHOP EVER, RUN!!!!<//review>

These guys are amazing (Aaron, johnny, peter). Super friendly, quick, and do high quality work. I dropped off my car on Thursday and was ready on Tuesday next week. They kept me posted throughout the whole process. I highly recommend these guys for all your car troubles.</Review>

They do a decent job except that they really need to get it right when it comes to planning. I took my Sportage for a not so big damage in the rear bumper and surrounding area. They said two weeks but they took almost two months. And, on the financial side, they kept sending revisions to the original estimate, really annoying and risky. Terrible. They definitely need to retrain management or change them. The negative impact on the customer is huge. I would definitely not take my car there again, absolutely would not refer them to anyone.<//Text>

<Text>Could not say enough good things about these guys. I brought my car in because of vandalism damage and they took care of everything with the insurance. Literally no hassle. Gave me a sweet rental car that I had for three weeks. When I came back to return my rental car, they even fixed my girlfriends bumper for free. 4/5 stars if I could.<//Text>< date>

The resulting bodywork they did on my 2019 KIA SUV was amazing! I know my car wasn’t old but the damaged parts of the body were real so when I went to pick it up I thought they gave me a new car!! It was a really well done job!<//review>

Of course you never want to take your car for repair but when you do, you hope to have honest and reliable service.Network Auto Body (Downtown Los Angeles) was a great customer experience. Fran at the front desk is very good at guiding you through the process. Marvin and Dave were great for providing details of work required on your car. Everyone is also very nice and timely. I needed my car back within 4 days for a trip and they delivered as promised. The repair work was like new and the pricing was fair. I would highly recommend Network Auto Body (Downtown Los Angeles) they are customer focused and trustworthy.< /Review>

Upon opening car, they quoted $11k for repair of two 2” dents from being rear ended. When I pointed out the absurdity, they yelled at me, said I owed them $2k for the quote assembly effort, and charged me for 11 nights parking at $125 per night. Their execs were squirrelly and demanded payment via cash or wire transfer cause they knew they were behaving badly. Hence, this review, my only way to have them known for the scam artists they are.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>So disappointed with this Auto Body. All I need was some simple blemishes removed from my car. They had my brand new 2020 Infiniti for 3 weeks and I still have blemishes all over my car. I don’t believe that they even changed out my sunroof it does not look brand new. I WANT MY DEDUCTIBLE BACK 1,000 wasted.</text>< pics>

They made the whole repair process seamless and even finished the job a full day ahead of schedule. The repairs look great and they returned the car with a much-needed wash. Geico rep Angel and others at Network Auto Body (Downtown Los Angeles) were friendly, returned messages promptly and easy to work with. I recommend them highly and without reservation.<//Review>< Pictures>

Few days back my car was brutally damaged in a road accident and got many bents and scratches. I went to this Auto Body Shop for my car repair. As it was in a very bad condition so I thought it may take few days for overall repair and clean-up process. But Network Auto Body people were able to sort out it in couple of days only. It was quite impressive and they also addressed all my concerns and were quite helpful thought out the process.
Their overall repairing services were quite satisfying and I could see my car in a much better condition now. Just loved their quick and affordable services. Highly recommended!</text>

Awesome Service! My car looks GORG!! Had all of the third party's insurance details, took care of everything. Offered to call over for my rental to pick me up (I walked, enterprise is practically up the block). Even received email and text updates on where they were in the progress of my repair. Convenient hours. Couldn't have really asked for an easier process!< /review>

<text>Last week I met with an accident in which my Audi Q5 had a major collision with SUV. The collision was so bad that my car's bonnet & bumper both got totally damaged. I called up my brother and he took my car to Network Auto Body shop as it was the nearest one to us. We both were highly impressed with professional and affordable services at auto body shop. Their collision repair services were quite quick and praiseworthy.  Very satisfied!!!<//text></record>

Last year I purchased second hand Audi Q5 from one of my friend. I used the car for like 7 months and then thought of getting it repainted so I took my car to Network Auto Body shop as I have heard much about this auto body shop in Los Angeles. They painted my car and gave it an overall brand new look. I was quite happy with their services. I would definitely recommend this shop to the ones who are looking for affordable and professional car paint shops.< /Text>

<Review>Last week I took one of my friend's car for some urgent work and unfortunately had a collision with another car on the same day. The car got damaged with few dents. As this auto body shop was the nearest so I went here for the repair. They repaired the bike in 3 hours. I returned the car to my friend next morning and he didn't even get to know what happened to his car! What a great relief I got after returning his car as it was before. Thanks to Network auto body shop.  it's worth paying them!< /Review><user_id>115210903862191458128<//user_id></record>

I had a lot of insurance communication issue when I got my car fixed recently, but the team at Network was understanding of my situation and extremely helpful. Shout out to Maria, she is a godsend people! Will definitely come back for car issues in the future.< /text>

< Review>
wish i could give 0 star. Do not bring your car here if you want quick and reliable service.
what I disliked.
1. I brought my car in for service at 11/6. They said it will take 8~10 business days. I ended up getting my car today on 11/28. They said it was due to the additional charge they had to collect from the insurance. Insurance sent out e-check on 11/23 and sent confirmation. Nonetheless, they held on to the car for 5 more days.

2. Now the car is back, it has the warning light on for tire pressure. Before bringing the car in, there was nothing wrong with tire, as I had only got the tire checked and rotated just several weeks ago. They could have at least given me a notice about it and ask me if i wanted to get it checked at. They apparently don't give much care about the quality of service as I would expect after paying thousands of dollars to them.<//Review>

I've been taking my cars to Network Auto Body for years. Most recently I took in my brand new BMW after I was rear ended. They make the process so easy and stress free. I was worried about how the color would match but it came out perfectly. Their staff and manager have always been super professional and informative. I will keep coming back for sure.</text>

<Text>I would give this place negative stars.  They are crooks and totally take advantage of people.  My Toyota was hit by a guy who ran a red light.  Insurance found the guy who hit me to be 100% at fault.  Toyota of Hollywood suggested I take my car to Network Auto Body.  Network Auto Body took advantage of my situation and they urged me to sign repair paperwork before the insurance adjuster came.  I was stupid enough to sign and authorized (I own my stupidity, but I live in LA and I was desperate to have my car back!).  In the end insurance refused to pay for the full bill because they said Network over priced it, and Network refused to release my car until the bill was paid in full.  I ended up having to pay $3000.00 out of pocket for an accident that was 0% my fault.  Obviously I made the mistake of listening to Network, but it proved they are not trust worthy.  Once the car was released my GPS wasn't working because the CD was stolen.  Network refused to take responsibility (of course; absolutely no way it could be their fault right?), but they were the only ones who had the car.  Super sketchy place.  Don't waste your time with them.</Text><user>109565380931032046096< /user>< time>

This place uses your car for what who knows mean while your thinking its being repaired. They damage your car and have no shame in denying it! Would never recommend anyone to bring their car here! I totally regret it I only came here because my dealership recommended me here but never again!!!!!
They're full of it when you walk in its all nice talk after all they do is give you the run around....<//Review>

the most CRIMINAL OPERATION I've ever heard of. Insurance company requests an estimate due to an accident. Then decides they don't have enough money to cover any damages. Network Auto Body never once mentioned $100 per day lot fees and is demanding $3,000 just to return the car with no repairs done. The owner and his employees are criminals< /Text>

<review>Horrible customer service ! I've been waiting a whole month for my car. And they keep promising it will be done following week, and always lie and tell me it's not ready.. (mind you it only had a tiny dent) I am very irritated because I need my car for work.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< rating>

Extremely kind, Professional and efficient staff! They received my referral for an extraction and had me in the next day. And made sure to keep me comfortable while the procedure was performed. Special shoutout to Shannon Hernandez for keeping me grounded. AND Dr. Habashy For a concise and steady hand.</Review>

<username>Loves Traveling<//username><rating>5<//rating><review>Never in a million years did I imagine giving a 5 star review to a place where I got a root canal. Well, here I am. I had to wait a couple weeks to get in to see Dr. Kim, and I am SO glad I did! Dr. Kim does nothing but root canals - all day, every day (though I imagine he takes off weekends!). He has it down to such a science that it was about as painless as a root canal could be. Even the shots to numb you up weren't so bad - and he was generous with numbing. He explained what he was doing as he was doing it and, because he does it all the time, he was pretty quick about it. He even took an xray when he was done to check his work. If I need another root canal I am going to try and ensure I come back to see Dr. Kim - even though it was a thirty minute drive. So worth it!</review>< pics>

< Review>
Fantastic work, I've been fighting city of trees dental for a year to get a single wisdom pulled.... RC dental got me a consultation in 2 days.... And a extraction within a week. The people are kind and prioritize information over bedside manner. I'm in pain yet extremely happy with the results..... Thank you guys❤️<//Review>

Dentist and Endo specialist are AMAZING! So attentive and helpful and professional! However the staff members are not that great... first was when they tried rescheduling the appointment with only one call. By confusing me later with two confirmation messages.
Today when I came to the dental appointment with my husband (I was interpreting for him as he is not fluent) the dental assistant asked me if I was my husband’s MOTHER! I am 8 years younger then him! I do not look like I am in my 50’s!
Highly recommend the doctors but I wish the staff was more professional and better trained.< /Text>

My son was seen by Dr. Michael & Shannon on January 6, 2021. He needed 2 wisdom teeth pulled out. He was very nervous about the procedure. Dr. Michael & Shannon were very professional & understanding when my son had an anxiety attack sitting in the chair. They offered 2 options, 1 was to get a referral to a different doctor who could sedate. Option 2 was to give nitrous oxide. They left room so, we could talk about the 2 different options. We choose the nitrous oxide option. Within 4 minutes of given nitrous oxide both teeth were pulled out. I would recommend RC Dental!<//review>

I may delete this review later but I think I should maybe write this .

If possible go to a different dental practice . I’m not exaggerating .....

I have been going to this dental practice for long enough to know it’s not a good one .
You may meet some decent staff (And even then you might want to be careful)  but the people working on your teeth , not so much .
Very unprofessional , inconsiderate , and just plain rude at times .

I could write a whole list  but there is a character limit anyways on these reviews (probably wouldn’t fit)

A dental practice should listen to the patient (considering they know their teeth better than just about anyone ) and try to help or accommodate them and what they feel needs to be done .

Unless you want people who ignore what you want , don’t care for your opinion on how your own teeth feel  or should feel , don’t bother .

Dentistry seems to be a terrible field in general I would say the only thing you should go to the dentist for is an extraction if needed .< /Review>

I had an extraction in March 2019. It was a good experience so when I needed another wisdom tooth extracted I was at ease thinking I would be good. Wrong Wrong I have never been treated so bad!!! Dr. Michael acted as though he was annoyed that I was there. There was only a piece left of my tooth. However, I was referred by my dentist because I had an infection and my nerve was exposed. I don’t know if he felt it was beneath him or what. The way he talked to me was so demeaning. I moved at first out of reflex he got mad and said you can go somewhere else. I am a person. Horrible I was in tears and I still don’t know why I was treated that way.< /review>

Doctor Vargas was a huge help with my broken tooth,  he is highly educated in his trade and can explain every procedure to the patient prior to performing the work. I recommend his work to everyone looking for a professional Dentist with true expertise.< /Review>

I've only been to them so far for root canals and wisdom teeth extractions, but I really liked them so I switched over to them for my primary dental care now. I'm terrified of dentists and they made it very easy for me. Everyone is friendly and even the front desk people are friendly and helpful.<//review>

<Review>I first came to Dr Kim in Jan 2017 and needed to be re-treated for three root canals I'd had done nearly three decades ago, elsewhere. All three re-treatments were done perfectly on my bottom, front teeth. Since I had three crowns on them, he told me I could lose all three, but I only lost one that had a post. It takes a very-skilled surgeon to accomplish that. Nearly three years later, they became a problem again. Dr. Kim had warned me about this, and I had also read about the odds of root canals becoming re-infected. This time, he did not recommend re-treating, but thought I should get a bridge. I had that done at Folsom Hills dentistry, Dr. O'Donnell, where I've gone  since 2014, and it worked out very well. I have Delta Dental insurance, and their yearly plans start at around $90 a year, for singles, and then they pay half of everything covered, plus a small office charge each time you go. For the bridge work, the dental office told me about Comenity - Smile Generation Financial. If you're approved, the office does the paperwork, and my half of the bill, after insurance, was $2258. The great part is that I have two years to pay it with no interest. For those of us who don't have work-related dental insurance, Delta Dental HMO insurance is a wonderful plan. They have a PPO plan too, but you have to wait a year before getting certain services covered. Go see Dr. Kim - he's one of the best, as is his office staff.<//Review><userid>114718457328239433960</userid>< Pics>

My daughter just had an orthodontist appt. They wouldn't let anyone in the back which is fine due to covid.  They made my daughter cry when talking about not being avil for apts. Due to domestic violence. The dentist says that's not her fault and  if your teeth get messed up it on us.  The person putting on the bands laughed in her face when she said it was due to domestic violence. Completely uncalled for. Will not return.</review>

< Review>
The Dentist screwed up a filing. Then shaved my tooth. Because of that I was in huge pain, couldn't do pressure or drink anything. I was in extreme pain even with a slitest touch. Due to the damage done, I was told I had to get a root canal & crown. I was told I had to pay for everything. I wasn't happy at all. They screwed up and I have to pay?? And then it took them almost a year to get the process started, and much more. It's the worst experience ever!! And till this day the tooth that they did, still hurts and I'm still paying the price for trusting this place to take care of my teeth.</Review>

I recently had my bottom wisdom teeth extracted at RC Dental. Took less than an hour for X-rays, discussing potential issues, local anesthesia and extraction. Dr. Habashy was very professional and extracted the wisdom teeth fairly quickly even though one was severely impacted. The recovery went better than expected with pain for only a couple days, no swelling and the sockets healing in about two weeks.< /Text>

I had such an unforgettable experience today with this amazing doctor , I went only for a consultation for a toothache, he did an x ray and my tooth had a bad inflammation I was crying from the pain , he immediately asked the front desk to call my insurance so he can treat me right away as an emergency.
Once my insurance gave them ok he started on root canal . The whole process took me like 30minutes.
From a seveeeeere pain to an extreme relief.

Great staff, great doctor, great all-around experience.
The staff really, truly in every way "went to bat" for me when dealing with the insurance folks.
I will always keep coming here until I have no more fixes to make regarding my teeth!
RC Dental group is fantastic - I would highly recommend it to anyone - and trust me, I've been to sooooooooooo many different dentists over the past 5 years especially, and you are highly, highly unlikely to receive better treatment (unless you happen to be a millionaire!).
Thank you RC Dental group!< /Review>

<response>None<//response><text>My sister came in for a check up and the dr told her she had no cavities and just a regular cleaning.
I looked at the xrays and seen tooth #3 had a huge cavity on the xrays. I told the dr he said I was wrong.
I was convinced that it was a huge hole very close the the nerve that we went to a private office and the dr said it was very deep and could possibly   be a root canal. We took care of it that day and I had to pay $400 out of pocket for a filling. I went back to RC dental to tell them that they made a mistake the receptionist lady was rude and didn’t even apologize for the huge cavity they missed. She even looked at the Xray and still said I was wrong still.
I work in the dental field and the experience I received is just HORRIBLE. I’m surprised they still have patients.< /text><name>sofiya sedykh< /name>< GmapID>

<Text>If  I could give it zero stars I would. I took an 89-year-old woman there recently for a root canal. She was in horrible pain and the doctor was very very rough with her and talked to her terribly.  The procedure was very painful for her and this was her third or fourth root canal and one week-she was already sore from procedures he had done a few days earlier but he kept telling her to be quiet when she was in pain. Who talks to and 89 year old woman this way?  I brought my 18-year-old granddaughter with me and she, too was appalled at the way the doctor was speaking to her.   He was literally yelling at her and not because she is hard of hearing. Because he was agitated and annoyed that he had such a difficult procedure at the end of his day.  I'm not sure which Dentist it was-I believe it was Dr. Kim KIM
He kept saying that this was the most difficult root canal he has ever done  blah blah blah and that on top of the fact that she was the last patient of the week made him upset. Do not go there unless you have a voice. A Voice who will tell them not to talk to you this way and to make sure you are completly  numb before he starts. The dentist office is awful.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

First of all, we (family of four) have been customers of this 'business' for years. After being the whole weekend under a lot of pain due to an upper molar that I later found out that needed surgery, I called RC Dental Group and left messages asking for an emergency visit on Monday morning. Since nobody contacted me, I showed up at their office on Monday and the front desk's clerk couldn't be less empathic or understanding. She just said that I could be evaluated later but not necessarily treated. When I asked about why I couldn't get treated, then this man came out from the inside office and said 'stop barking...'. When I replied that I was not barking because I was not 'a dog', he apologized. I left the office upset.  Afterwards, I called the office manager to place a formal complaint, and instead of using de-escalating techniques such as 'we are sorry sir, that you're under so much pain and we are going to make as much as we can to accommodate you with one of our dentists', she said that I shouldn't be so sensitive, since 'stop barking is a figure of speech', and that the man who said that to me was actually the dentist who owns the place. With that, and the office manager still being sarcastic over the phone, I dismissed myself (and the rest of my family members) from their practice. Sometimes, we forget that some people will argue to the teeth with customers, not realizing that they are the ones losing not just business but also reputation.</text>

I had a tooth pulled a few days ago. Before i seen the dentist I yold every staff member I am hard to numb and require extra medication.
Told the doctor he said ok. Thats fine. Does his injections. Five min later walks in to extract my tooth. Told him im not numb still. Which apparently meant nothing because he went right in and yanked it out in pieces. Which i had expected. But it hurt the whole time. I squirmed and clencged my body but they never stopped. They just kept pulling. Here i am 4 days later. Made another appointment to be seen tomorrow because now my entire jaw hurts. Bone, muscle, veins.  All of it. I cant eat. Tylenol 3 for a pain killer is a joke and im definetly going somewhete elese for my root canal. They shouldn't be practicing dentistry. Period.</Review>

< Review>
Doctor was a complete A-HOLE! i took my child out after he verbally badgered my 8 year old for crying during an extraction, saying things like "i have all day to wait for you to stop crying we can set you up in the corner with your toys until your ready to be a big kid," and "you got your way after all that fussing you get to go home now," my daughter has been awake for tooth extractions before and never reacted like she did to the surgeon today, he was uncompassionate and i do not suggest this office for your child's sake. Needless to say we walked out after the first extraction of the appointment was completed and told the doctor he needed a lesson in people skills when dealing with adolescent patients. Better luck to the next person!<//Review>

Horrible service. They were a referral specialist but the service lacked big time. They did not get our records ahead of time. Left us waiting and said they called our regular dentist but they never called. We called and requested the records and even after they were received they still kept us waiting. We were waiting or over 3 hours....and we still have to go back again. They don't do their job and expect the client to do it for them yet they don't tell you that.< /text>

Way to slow. On time for appt. but always wait 1 to 2 hours to see dentist. Last appt. my child’s teeth were
ex-rayed and cleaned but dentist did not come in for over an hour. The children’s dentist is ALWAYS ridiculously slow and behind.<//Review>

They over schedule clients.  The wait is ridiculously long and inconvenient.  I do not recommend this orthodontist if your time is valuable to you.<//Text>

Absolute worse service! Not my first time waiting over 45min and not one person has walked in the back to apologize or let me know what is going on. Not to mention I'm here on an emergency appointment. Worst place. I have only had one appointment here in the past year that has gone good.< /review>

<Review>So this is long overdue but this is THEE worst dentist office in all the greater Sacramento area. I went there (begrudgingly) between 1998-2011 on and off because of the insurance I had then as a MINOR.

When I was a child I went there and started to cry from the pain and the dentist literally told me (in front of my mother) "if you don't knock it off then I'll have to stop and if I don't get this done quick enough then I won't make any money off of this visit"

Needless to say I've always been terrified of the dentist.

Forward to 2010/2011, my senior year of HS, and I'm forced to go there again after 7 years of no dentist due to fear. I got a root canal done and medical didn't cover porcelain crowns so my mother signed to pay out of pocket $600 for the porcelain. I was 17. She signed everything. She started payments to pay it off. Fast forward almost 2 years and they came after ME for collections for money my mother never paid because on the last day when they inserted the crown I had been 18 for not even a week. Cool. I didn't sign anything however I was19 and didn't want my credit going to hell already. While making payments by debit card got stolen so I canceled it and got a new one. I called and left message after message for them to call me for my new card info and never heard back and then BAM another collection notice so I had to go into the office to contact them.

Then at my previous job (won't mention where) they would order certain things from us, demand specifics at certain times, then when we get there refuse to answer their phones, the building was often locked, no way to contact them, and if we were able to deliver they were rude, and once told us "Im not tipping you because your job requires zero skill". (Said by a receptionist). Now we never expected tips however saying that is rude and shows how little class you have, especially after they always made us wait and were always rude and impossible to contact.

Overall bad business practices, rude employees, bad dentistry (often have pain in the tooth that I had a root canal in, which shouldn't be possible) and Rhiannon the office manager is rude, incompetent, and lucky I didn't have enough money to sue when she came after me for money when I never agreed to pay, my mother did.

Avoid them at all costs.<//Review><GmapID>0x809add030a46bed1:0xefcf5d5f3d389b82</GmapID></record>

Absolutely adorable adore.  Very friendly staff. So not dentist approved.  ;P

More than just candy and soda too. The store is full of novelties and lunchboxes and all sorts of nostalgia. Check out the alcove of games in the back,  so unique!</text>

Very cool candy store. Lots of old and new options. They have an awesome root beer and cream soda collection for sale. Great place to stop,just hold on to your kids as they might have candy overload. There are lots of bottles at toddler hieght, so make sure you hold onto your younger children!< /review>

You like candy? soda? This is your shop. Outstanding selection of sweets and chocolates. They have several regional items only sold in particular US states. Worth a visit just to see these quirky products.<//text>

<review>This place reminds me of Spencer's. Had a great variance on candy, knick-knacks, and comic books.

Bought a Toxic Waste sour candy from here, liked that I didn't have to order one from Amazon, disappointed by the size of candy, but that's on the manufacturer.<//review><time>1498951072141<//time>< username>

I feel like a kid going to this store. They serve varieties of fun, quirky products like wasabi toothpaste or buffalo wings flavored soda. Yes, you read that correctly.

Aside from that, they also sell craft soda and root beers, among variety of candies that you don't usually find in your usual mini markets.

I ended up getting a few bottles of craft root beers (delicious!), a bottle of peanut butter soda (horrible!), and a tube of wasabi tooth paste (too scared to try..).

Overall, a good experience, and I'll definitely come back again whenever I need my craft root beer fix, or if I'm feeling adventurous :)< /review>

Great place to find just what is needed for ethnic hair. They always have the new items that I thought I would have to order online. So, I give it a five for having the newest items, and knowing  what they are. I drive from Temecula, but well worth the drive. The building is an older building, but congrats to the owner who had the idea to try that location. (Right on the main road.) All in all worth stopping in to see what items you will find.</text>

Have been renting from them for 3 years. Overall pretty good experience. Reason for poor review has to do with issue concerning maintenance. A person has been building a fence for a year. Thefence now looks like 4 different designs poorly painted and has screws sticking out. Addiotiony the person hired stays till 11 pm at times. Has created a mess in the back area of the property and several other things to numerous to list.</text>

<review>Don't do it. Just don't. One word: SLUMLORD! This business preys upon the poor and the underprivileged and has no shame doing so. Expect a ridiculously lengthy and detailed application process, and then if you do get approved, expect to never hear from them unless they are owed money. They don't care about anything else except for getting that rent check every month on time.

I rented a small house that honestly should never have been inhabited. I had rampant mold problems, which they kept on promising me they would take care of, but ultimately never did ANYTHING except for have some contractor come out inspect the property. There were rats in the ceiling ( could hear them running around and squealing), termites in the windowsills, no heat ( they were supposed to install baseboards but never did- instead they gave me ONE portable oil heater), a serious lack of outlets (only 5 in the whole house- definite fire hazard as we had to use a plethora of extension cords), oh...and the ceiling was LITERALLY CAVING IN. It was drooping and cracking from poor maintenance and looked as if it was ready to go at any minute.

I have pictures to prove all of this....these are pics of the mold that was widespread and impossible to get rid of.

If you are late on the rent, expect  a $50 late fee plus $35 for each '3 day notice' they drop at your door. Yeah, it costs them $35 to drive a quarter mile from the office to where my house was located, apparently.

They began an eviction process on me awhile ago, and I was only one month behind on rent ( and still paying any chance I could anytime I had money)....the amount of late fees that had accrued was equal to the amount of rent I owed. I lived there for 4 years,  and had only recently been  falling behind. Previously I had prepaid the rent months in advance. But if they don't  get their money...oh god, watch your back.  It is criminal, and it is sad that they get away with this. They deal with a population of people who don't have the means or the money to fight back, and it is pathetic.

So if you are considering renting through S &S property management, I urge you to seriously reconsider.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjFDvuuU4PXKc3BgVetX-N9QUc0ImCCn35NtmR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjgAM0C-S2SHPQJkvBTHKt5UFORuFtaEfhIU7p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFH0xtaCDeDUBruRnOtbsYRVpyiUqlNS0fDXOa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8aZmj-vUyBZJJKcCqtrVtPcFjFcAjctDNKpyp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqwfSoFcoShCbvrK9Ux6H3KPvhuldjgCiUW0d-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x809ad14dc3ffb421:0x44bd9d5794a91168</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Very unprofessional. I applied for a property went through the entire process before I was able to view the residence. They called and asked me to view the property the following day after turning in everything required. After the viewing I received a email stating she needs the full 7yrs of my rental history when the application says 2months.  I had already provided them with the last 3 months days before. I ask why am I being asked for rental history since move in? Her response was the “sub” in the office for my original resident management team for the day told her it was 10 late payments. She then corrected herself and told her no, actually it’s only two the others were incorrectly charged to her account they were reversed. She then states she needs to verify that for herself. Only to turn around and tell me she had already giving the property to the other applicant because she couldn’t reach someone in the office and their application would be provided to the owner. So now the property is no longer available anymore. I personally feel like it was a race thing. After I go to view the property I get the run around then when I asked why the full rental history is being requested then I don’t hear from her for a few hours when her responses were 15-30 mins all morning & during the entire process. So instead of just stating she had already giving someone else the rental she bull**** me for a few hours. When in the beginning of the process I was told if i didn’t have all the required information by Friday at 4:30 they would move on with the other applicant. It was a hour before closing she called back stating she needed to verify and 30 seconds later said it wasn’t available anymore. She had giving them the place before I could even drive off the property this morning.</Review>

I had my application in for almost a year with this property management place and they did nothing to help find a home. First they wanted double deposit which I made work. Then They had us do a wish list while we were looking and were suppose to call when property that fit our wish list came up and never once called I always had to search myself. Due to the Covid it made things more difficult. Rather than working with us they flat ignored most my requests and finally our application expired, They were not willing to help or extend it at all. Just wanted us to pay more money. Worst experience ever.< /text>

Unresponsive to those who are interested in a property. Will give you the run around for weeks. They don’t return phone calls or emails. The girls who do answer the phone seem immature and have unprofessional demeanor. I should have check the reviews on here before I attempted to make contact with these people in the first place. Will happily look elsewhere!</Review>

<review>I own a rental in West Sacramento and a few years ago changed management firms. Since S & S property has taken over the management of my property I couldn't be happier! They are so professional and easy to work with. Unlike my previous management firm they stay in touch with my tenants and are quick to respond to any problems. As a property owner, I want my tenants to feel secure and comfortable in their home.
S & S immediately notifies me of any repairs that need to be done and seem to have a great staff of people to do the work. I have never had a tenant complain and I've experienced 0 problems with their management. I highly recommend them if you own a rental or or looking to lease a home!</review>< gmap_id>

Bad Company! They require first to fill out the application form, pay $ 35 per person for non-refundable fee, provide copies of the documents: ssn, drive license, bank statement for the last 2 months, a copy of taxes, a copy of the payments for the previous rental locations of the Apartments, after which they will review all your data for several days , Then they will only be able to show you the house that you like, until all this they do not show anything !! While they have only a few options in the database of good houses for rent! And wishing people to these houses a lot! So you give them all your personal information on what basis, pay money that does not come back and wait, if the landlord you want to rent on your application agrees, the option is 1% of 100% that you can withdraw The house that you found online on their site, after that time how much will take the whole process! In fact, the search for a house will be delayed for several weeks with this approach, and your profile and $ 35 are valid only for half a year. Our situation - we found 3 houses on their site, we want to see them, we have a good history and good income, we need to enter the house tomorrow or after tomorrow, but they will not show us this property until all personal information, payment and verification Data (according to the manager it will take from 3 days), they want a lot at home, and there are not enough houses in the database! Why should we provide all our personal data and pay fee, if we have not seen the house from the inside, maybe we will not like it, and there is no guarantee that we can do it all with all this paper work! This is complete nonsense! No apartment complex requests so much personal information like taxes, bank statement !! It's too much. Change the policy, guys, work for the client, and not to collect personal information and fee! You should show us all the houses that we liked, then put on hold the house that we choose, remove it from advertising and shows, and then demand the application, fee, the remaining documents and then conduct the whole process of the transaction between Client and owner! What you are doing now is more like a scam. Good luck!</text>

Our experience with this office started back in September of 2016. The property manager that was supposed to move us in was 45 min late, through entire process of walk through she was on the phone, and paid no attention to us; we basically did the walk through by ourselves. After living for a year at the house, we decided to change the residence. Due to high rent demand, we had no choice but go with same property management. Did the walk through at the move out process, were promised to get the security deposit within 3 weeks. Never happened, for no reason, they didn't send us the check. When we tried to resolve the issue via phone, and emails, were just ignored. Asked to get a hold of office owner, were refused. Found the owner's page on the Facebook, tried to communicate, never heard back. The staff is not knowledgeable of their own contracts, one person doesn't know what another is doing.
Those people care about money only: they act nice till the moment the get first check from you, then, you are like trash for them. Would never recommend this office to anybody!
If there would be negative star, we would give it them!</review>

Hopes were high at our walk through with our new property management (who took our lease over mid lease) July 3rd 2019. Maintenance requests seemed as they would be handled in an appropriate time frame as someone came to take estimates July 13th 2019. Unfortunately here we are September 19th 2019 with nothing being fixed and getting the same run around from the receptionist. Left three voicemails for the maintenance department over the past month with not even an courtesy call back. This is being handled exactly the opposite of how we were told it would at our walk through.</Review>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>HUGE HUGE HUGE PROBLEM!! No accountability when something happens. I have been a tenant for over a year and have had good communication until now. I am still renting a house until the end of this month. My husband and I went out of state for 8 days and when my husband returned there were items missing from our garage. We pull the cameras and find the landscaper contracted through the owner of the house or management company ( not sure who he’s with) went in our garage and took whatever he wanted. We contact the owner because it was a Sunday and at first he says the landscaper has worked for him for a long time and does not sound like something he would do. Then we tell him about footage and he says oh! Maybe he thought you guys moved already..... WHY WOULD THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE? Is my first thought. My next thought is we still have our keys and have given no indication that we left accept for our notice dated 12/31. Owner calls back to tell us he had actually given the guy permission to take items. So far between the owner and management company all we have been offered is a shotty apology and because the landscaper returned almost everything ( electronics still missing) they don’t feel like we deserve any kind of credit. We have requested our rent back and they flat out refuse to give anything!!! THIS IS BAD BUSINESS. You broke into our house, stole our stuff and all you say is sorry.< /Review>< userid>

<text>This was our first experience renting out a home. The entire staff was very responsive and made the entire process stress-free and simple. It has been a few months now and we are still very satisfied. The management fees are far cheaper than the competition. My one recommendation would be for a paperless option for the monthly statements / reports (unless that feature exists and I couldn't find it).<//text></record>

<Text>S&S uses a very easy system to log in, pay rent and submit maintenance requests. When contacting the office, the people we have spoken with have been wonderful and very accommodating. After having dealt with terrible property management companies over the years, it is refreshing to find an honest company. Glad we found them! Plus, we love our place so that makes it even better ;) Thanks!</Text>< pics>

Great company to trust! The owner actually met with my husband and I for our first meeting! He was very friendly and made us feel comfortable. I'm so glad that we decided to go with S&S Property Management! The past two years renting our house has been stress free and overall a great experience! I highly recommend S&S Property Management!!!!</Text>

I've worked with S&S to manage my first rental property in West Sacramento for over six years now. It's been a great experience. So great, in fact, that our family has purchased four additional rental homes in the Sacramento region. We take a lot of pride in providing exceptional, top-quality rentals to our tenants and S&S has helped make it a great experience for us and for the tenants.<//Review>

S&S property management has been extremely professional and friendly ever since we signed up for our rental. They have a fast response rate and we know if there are any issues, we can count on them to handle it quickly. I would recommend working with them on your rental or home purchase.</review>

Very disappointed worked with them for almost two and a half weeks then the property we thought we would be moving into soon was taken off the market by the owner not impressed no sense of personal service at least in our case I'll sent you as I look through the reviews I see lots of concerns being voiced by clients that seemed to be completely ignored in the responses if you do right with this company you better make sure you keep a good log of what's going on good pictures and make sure the hot water heater works it sounds like</Text>

I called the office and ask were there any current applicants on the property 783 Shoreside Dr Sacramento Ca 95831. I was told there were none. I applied, my credit is over a 700, I work for a multimillionaire company Four seasons Fléur powered by TELEFLORA Flowers as a florist and flower distribution making over 6 figures a year.

I received a letter indicating they could not verify me. I don’t have a personal bank account I have a business account in which I use. They wanted me to have a bank account in the state California you not required to have a personal bank account. I file my taxes every year on time and have legal zoom as a paralegal. I was age decriminalized because I’m a young adult. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THIS IS A VIOLATION OF FAIR HOUSING ALONG EITH THE OTHER 100 complaints against them.

Ummm, where do I start? While my home has not been perfect as they often aren't, my experience with S & S has been very good as follows:

1)	The dishwasher did not work properly when I moved in. It took a few runs to realize it wasn't working properly but when I called and spoke to their maintenance coordinator, she was friendly and had it taken care of within 48 hours.
2)	Shortly after I moved in the water heater broke… ugh… Again, the maintenance coordinator, Sarah, took care of things right away. It did take a little while because I needed a new water heater. I realize permits and pricing limited things but I had hot water within 24 hours. This may seem like a long time but it was worth having it fixed properly.
3)	When I call, everyone is super friendly. If I have questions, Jennifer or Beverly route me to the    correct department.
4)	Finally!!! I can pay my rent online!!!
5)	Did I mention I can finally pay rent online!!!

Anyway, property management must be a tough job. I have always rented and had some serious problems in the past but with this company, I feel secure that they will try to fix things in a timely manner and they listen when I have a problem. That is worth 5 stars for sure!<//Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>We lived at our residence for 49 months. The property sold and the new owner hired S & S properties to handle the property we were given a 60 day for the owner to move into our residence. We moved approx 45 days after the new owner took ownership and paid rent through the final day we resided in the unit. We supplied S & S properties with move out photos and a forwarding address and called several time to speak with someone in regards to deposit refund, as a side note there was never a walk through done with the previous owner so the property was bought as is. After waiting 27 days which is over the CA time frame for legally holding a deposit once a property is surrendered (21days) I call the office and was told no one was available to discuss this with me as I had been told several times over the past two weeks with no return call or email which they had my email address. So I decided to email them asking why I did not receive anything yet. No answer so a few hours later I send a demand letter by email stated I want my $1,000.00 full since they forfeited all rights to hold any of it by not responding with in the legal 21 day time frame by law.  I got a email stating they had received my email. I called the office and was told I would get a call back within the hour. 5 hours pass no call I then email again and get a itemized letter stating that I would not be getting any of my deposit that there were more damages and cleaning than my $1,000.00 deposit covers and they will send me the invoices once they complete work. So now we are going to head to civil court were I will ask for the legal limit of $3,000.00 three times my deposit.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

My experience with this company is extremely disappointing. Prior to me submitting an application  and paying the app fee I spoke with a representative regarding the requirements for the application I am newly engaged and me and my fiance do not have the best credit but its not horrible my biggest issue with credit is I dont have any which I explained to the representative. She still encouraged me to apply and assured it wouldnt be an issue as long as I had no evictions or anything in collections in which I do not. After paying $90 in app fees and submitting the application I got notice my app was denied because I dont have an active credit line which I had already informed a representative. This company is dishonest and basically only encouraged me to apply to take my money with no intentions on actually renting to me. It’s really messed up how these companies take advantage of honest hard working people  just trying find a home.</Text>

<response>None</response><Review>I moved into a property managed by S&S in February 2016. Initially, there was a miscommunication (maybe an illegible fax phone number) that caused a delay in maintenance (no hot water for a few days, needled to install washer dryer hook ups that took a couple weeks). Once this incorrect phone number was corrected, S&S has been very quick to respond to maintenance calls and requests. The hot water heater broke and they had a repair man out to see it within hours and replaced the next day. Their online website has been easy to use and the staff always pleasant. I will continue to rent with them.<//Review>< pics>

Everyone in the front office is rude & lacks any communication skills (especially Marie). I'm currently renting with them and I have a 1 year lease. Let me tell you, I cannot wait until move out day! They're nice before you become tenants, but once you start renting, it's like entering a nightmare. Anna is the only one I can really say is kind and goes above & beyond for her customers. Go Anna!
Update 1: They commented back saying what is the neighbors address, but I literally told them it's the neighbors next to me. They are the property management, they should know who lives next to me, if they are leasing the neighbors as well. I'm not going to intrude on someone's property to find out their apartment number. Yet another example of unprofessionalism.
Update 2: I broke my lease from the dump I was staying at (461 maple st unit G), because of safety issues that were brought to the attention of the police department. I am so happy I left this unprofessional property management. The place was a dump that had drug addicted no life's living downstairs. The landlords were racist and they were lucky I didn't file a complaint against the housing authority.< /review>

We have newly rented a home managed by S & S Property.  So far our experience in just 3 weeks has been horrible.  We have reported no hot water in the bathrooms and were ignored the first week after reporting it.  The customer service is nonexistent from S & S.  Our property manager only called when forced to do so, although he knew we had reported the problem.  The plumber has been out twice and so far no luck getting us hot water.  Allegedly they did not know about the hot water to disclose it to us prior to move in.

There are many other issues which they have ignored as well; closet door has to be manhandled, garage door opener does not work, light remote does not work, dishwasher had a build up of black sludge.  The list goes on.<//Review>

I've been renting from S&S since 2007 and have rented three homes from them. Repairs are always done quickly and the staff is very professional! I highly recommend using them if your looking for a home.<//text>

We used them to rent out a property. They never gave us the contract and they are very unorganized. All they do is take your money and do nothing in return. You have to show up unexpectedly in order to talk to someone because they NEVER return your calls. Worst property management service ever!< /text>

Searching for a home can be tough, however, with the help of S&S property management the experience was easy and affordable. It made me and my husbands experience of finding a home stressless. The staff was and is always nice , professional, easy to talk to , and very responsive . I have already referred family and friends to this company .<//Text>

I cant believe the reviews im reading  I have been renting a home  from them for almost 4 years and they still can fix thing that they said they were going to fix when I did my walk through. The home has mold that they neglected to tell me I just clean it every year. But Service is far from good. I will post the address where I live when I move out. so other people can be aware of this property.    Rude No customer service skills. They forget they are also clients some where.<//Text>

Horrible experience. When i moved out, they charged me for stuff that wasnt even in the house when we rented it. Don't ever rent from these people. Unprofessional. All they care about is making money. Don't waste your time with these people.</Text>

<review>Very responsive to my own requests but there's a neighboring tenant that's been a headache to the entire complex ever since before I moved in.

Worst property management company ever.

We could barely get them to respond to us for repairs. Bill Showers the owner, told my boyfriend that our rent money we pay them every month means nothing compared to what they invested in the property (that's why we had to beg them to install a dryer vent, which vented UNDER the duplex, and is a code violation). Come to find out that the actual OWNER was the one who spent the money to fix things in the place, before turning it over to S&S (the place still needed work). Our next door neighbors were PSYCHOTIC. They flooded our backyard the first weekend we were in the duplex and we had to leave a very polite note on their door (because they wouldn't answer). They harassed us the whole time we were there and flooded our yard again.  S&S punished us for the dispute (We documented everything and called the cops). I believe there were discriminatory actions going on between our druggie neighbors, the owner and S&S. The other tenants had been there for 7 years and I don't think the owner nor S&S had the b***s to do anything about them, their barking dogs or the fact that they were on DRUGS and bullying US like we were the problem.

Places like this will try to abuse you and make you feel like you are a problem for wanting to live comfortably and in peace.

Their so called property managers are cowards and in the short time I lived there I didn't even know I had a property manager for our unit. Sheila is awful and rude. She was so nasty and condescending over the phone and then played nice when we came to do our walkthrough on move out. She acted like everything was in good shape, THEN had Leticia from the office reach out and tell us our carpet cleaner did not do the job properly. The vendor returned to the property and re did the job, and Leticia verified that it was cleaned properly.

They also are in the business of scamming people when it comes to pet policies. They list on almost all of their properties that pets are acceptable and then they retract that policy. Many people have had these freaks come to their homes to check out and meet their dogs and sometimes unannounced. I do not think these owners even know what these nuts are doing.

The property we vacated has yet to rented since we have moved.....I wonder why. You have been warned.< /Review>

This place is horrible , they have horrible communication and when your actually looking for a home they do not care they work on their own time not yours . I viewed a property had to call them to pay the 50 $ application just to be told it was given to someone else , then they tried to say it was my fault for my old landlord not calling them back ?! They took my 50 bucks and said sorry it’s not refundable even tho they never even ran a credit check . This place is a waste of time DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME

I want to state, I am not a renter or a in anyway affiliated with this company accept for I am one of many poor neighbors of one of their rental properties they manage. The house next door to me  has been a rental for several years. This past November new 'tenants' moved in. How did they pass any kind of background? This is a $1700 a month rental, not cheap, but somehow they managed to rent it out to gang members. So that is the type of place this is. As long as you have the $$ (they deal drugs from the house) or whatever else to 'pass' a so called background and credit check, then they will rent to you. I'm disgusted. Law enforcement has been contacted.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

We love our home but S&S was nightmare to deal with. We would not recommend them to anybody that's looking to rent.< /Review>

Big waist of time. Gave them all the information they needed to process our application and paid the application fees for all apps witch wasn't cheap. And they pocketed all the money.</Text>

Horrible, CBS13 just did a story on them for freaking a would be renter out. My GF rented from them and they lied and cheated her out of money and a post office key deposit.

Go somewhere else.</review>

<text>DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY!!!
I don't know who is to blame but the front office staff is so disorganized and unprofessional.  I constantly have to follow up on any work order and the office manager refuses to take my phone call.  I would think twice about renting any property from this company!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>Fantastic car buying experience. JR and Francisco were amazing and I feel like truly cared about my happiness more than making a sale. I was blown away by their customer service both at the dealership and in the first 48hours after. Little things like making sure my phone app works really add up. These guys do it right!<//Review>< Pics>

<text>They did an amazing job with getting us an extremely great deal, and met every expectation that we had!
They were all extremely nice and welcoming and didn’t pressure us into making a deal. They let us take our time to really figure out what we wanted and talked us through the whole process.</text>< gmap_id>

So pleased and glad I found this gem of a dealership. Everyone on the phone and at the facility were friendly, accommodating, professional and eager to help. I had no trouble at all. It was well, very well, worth the drive for me. I highly recommend anyone who wants a privately owned, customer based dealership, with core values and upstanding staff to give them attention. The process was smooth, everyone made things simple and easy. I was treated with respect and any questions I had were explained throughly and politely. Not to mention, they have a pretty sweet little road to test drive around the dealership. Huge huge thank you to everyone there.< /Review>

<review>We recently bought a vehicle from Lampe Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram in Visalia. It was an overall excellent vehicle buying experience. Our sale rep Freddie was very knowledgeable. He was able to answer all our questions. He also got us a very good price on our new vehicle and our trade in. We would highly recommend this dealership to anyone. We will definitely be doing business with them in the future.< /review></record>

I went into Lampe Dodge yesterday at 11am to just test drive the new Ram 1500 4x4 trucks. Walked out of there at 1:30pm with a new truck. The overall experience was outstanding from the time I stepped into the lot. NO SHARKS CIRCLING, which happened at all the other dealerships I’ve ever been to.

From my salesman Robert, to Mike the numbers guy, to the woman in the finance department (sorry forgot her name) there was ZERO pressure. Once I chose a truck after the test drives the entire sale took less than an hour and half. What sold me on Lampe is their personal touch and the no extra cost of the lifetime power train warranty. That’s right I said LIFE TIME!!!

I would recommend Lampe Dodge to anyone looking to buy a new vehicle.

Great job to everyone.< /text>

<text>Their service manager Jim, the guys in the service department, and the techs have been excellent. They got my vehicle serviced expediently and also helped with some custom order stuff. The service manager also has gone above and beyond in assisting me with a third party vendor issue, thats the kind of service they offer at Lampe. Definitely worth the drive from fresno to be treated as a valued customer. Thanks so much guys.<//text>< Name>

<Review>JR was a good salesman busy, hard working, kind, knowledgeable and not pushy, he is what eared the 4 stars and the price of the truck was great! I knocked off a star because initially the “money man” in finance came back with a 3.99% and a 4.99% offer which to me and my wife was a joke, we have very high credit scores so there was no way we were paying that high. Once our credit was run they came back at 2.55% which was more like it. I did not like the feeling of the initial offer and I also think they could have worked with us on our request for added running boards, the manager Chris said nope can’t do it for free, but I think on a car you are paying over $60k for to make your customer happy you could have included $500 fixed running boards as I am to short to enter the vehicle safely. It left a bad taste in my mouth. Otherwise pricing was great, salesman JR was great and I liked the man who finished up our paperwork.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Salesman was pleasant; however, we were very disappointed to find out AFTER the sale that the key fob and front and back car mats were missing. The one extra key fob was $300. Plastic was covering where floor mats were suppose to be. When we called back thinking that perhaps they neglected to put them back in, the only thing the manager, Chris, could say was somestimes they just don't come with used cars. They will probably be pricey if you try to buy them through the dealership.Never have we had an experience quite like this when buying a used car. Guess the days of good customer service are gone....it is just buyer beware. Live and learn. If you go there to by a used car. Just make sure you ask....buy the way, does this car come with floor mats and two keys to the car. It is no longer a given. I
UPDATE: This morning, the very next day after my purchase, I received a call from, Ted, the man at the top of Lampe in Visalia. He apologized for my experience at the dealership and said that he was going to make sure I was reimbursed for the $300 fob and that we would be getting floor mats for our car free of charge. He further stated that, Chris, the manager I had spoke with, was a great guy and only following guidelines as instructed. He stated after reading my review, he was changing his policy at the dealership and that every car sold at his dealership from now on would have 2 fobs and car mats. He stated that customer service was very important and he wanted his dealership to project that. Needless to say, I was very impressed with Ted. Not only did he make it right for us; he reflects what every person buying a car wants...trust in the dealership.</review>

<Text>I inquired for great deals online and was able to secure an appointment the same day.
My appointment was at 6pm and some staff had to stay until my purchase was final. Even having to stay for a few hours after closing, they maintained their kindness and professionalism. Mr. Nunez was very informed about the products available and answered my questions with confidence.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Happy to say we added number five ! Working with JR again and having the best experience as always . Thank you again !
This was our 4th time purchasing from Lampe and always a great experience.  What stands out most is JR, he is the most honest and reliable sales person I have worked with at a variety of dealerships. Lampe you are lucky to have a genuine salesman such as JR. we look forward to future deals with you !< /Review>

My husband and I just purchased a truck at Lampe and we give our experience a 5 star rating. We were referred by a friend who had recently had a great experience also purchasing a truck. Reggie, Chris, Shelby and Jim took great care of us each step of the way. We were never pressured and all of our concerns and questions were graciously and accurately considered and answered. Shelby in the finance department was simply awesome! Shelby was so fast, friendly and efficient! She really went the extra mile! Jim in the Parts department was fantastic as well and within hours of buying the truck all of our "extras" were done!  We highly recommend this dealer based on our 5 star experience!< /review>

Huge shout out to Lindsay Paris for outstanding customer service. After a horrible experience with Hanford jeep, (I was treated with disrespect and an inconvenience by their service manager) I was told I had no warranties and starting price was going to be $2,400. She took such great care of me and my jeep.  She found my warranty and the next level care warranty that I had. There was a couple  of oops from the tech that she addressed on my schedule and make everything right. Even had my jeep (Janice Joplin) washed and pretty. Thank you Lindsay for everything.</Review>

<Review>Took my truck in for a new key to get programmed and an oil change. They said they would call when it was complete but never did I had to call at 4:30 then rush to pick it up after getting home I noticed a puddle of coolant under my truck. After having my truck all day and supposedly doing an oil change they never caught that my secondary upper radiator hose had a leak. Terrible service department.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>My husband was called to schedule service for a recall on his Ram truck. We made an appointment and dropped off the truck first thing in the morning on the appointment day. Were told and given paperwork that it would be ready by end of the day. When we hadn't heard from them by 4:30pm, my husband called and was told that someone would check on it and call him back. The website said that they were open until 7pm, so we waited until around 5:30pm to call back when we still hadn't heard from them, only to find out that the service department closed at 5pm. No phone call. No communication that they didn't finish the work and needed to keep the truck. Nothing. The next morning we called first thing and again were told someone would check and call us back. Another couple hours and no return phone call, we called again to be told it was ready to pick up. Very poor customer service and communication. Only excuses that they were very busy when we expressed our disappointment.< /text>< UserId.>

Went to Lampe to car shop was only there to look, got greeted by JR and had to take the deal he gave me! One of the best experience so far as I purchased my car he gave me the best deal I saw in The Valley! JR is very honest and helpful he does not push the sale if he sees your un certain which I loved that about him it could be very overwhelming when your shopping for a car but with him helping my experience  there was smooth. Definitely if your in the look out for a new car go to him!< /Review>

Had an appointment to have a hitch installed and was notified at appointment that they don’t have 1 for my jeep on stock. I was informed then that I’d have to pay for hitch in order for them to order it and do not have a ETA on arrival. When I made appointment I spoke to parts department at which time they told me parts needed for my jeep then transferred me to service desk to schedule appointment. I was never told that I needed to pay at that time. Left an early morning appointment disappointed with no hitch installed.<//Review>

Just bought a new 2018 Dodge Journey. The salesman J.R. was very helpful and friendly. He informed us of all the specifics of the car. He showed us around 4 different vehicles and he was able to tell us all the pros and cons of all of them, basically read our minds on what we wanted. Everyone was very helpful and friendly all the way through. I would definitely recommend them to my family and friends! And I will be buying my next car from them. Salesman J.R. was very helpful along with other salespeople during the process. It went quite smoothly. We were out of there in about 3 hours which is a record from all the previous vehicles that I purchased!</text>

Went in for the first oil change. No appointments allowed, but very little info about how to get going in the process. Wound up blundering through the process successfully, but some signs would have been nice. Staff was friendly and efficient, facility was tidy and clean, COVID precautions were well executed. I will go back for regular service.</review>

Great service from the time I pulled up, my salesman Robert was super friendly and not one of those pushy salesmen that make you want to leave and not wanna buy a car. The staff overall were super professional and made my car buying process super easy, will definitely be going back in the future.</Review>

<text>This dealership practices bait 'n switch tactics. My girlfriend got a cashier's check for the amount of the vehicle on the promise that the vehicle would be put on hold. After getting the check, the car "was sold while I was on lunch" which was stated by multiple employees. After breaking the news, they tried to up sell her a similar vehicle for $3K more. Mike, who she was dealing with, is a repeat offender of this based on other dealership reviews. The dealership has replied to comments involving Mike by assuring that he will be spoken to but there is no indication that his actions have changed. This leads me to believe that this is a standard practice of this dealership and any claim that they are trying to do better is a lie.</text><gmap_id>0x8095279546bcb91d:0x297aca8f1694b2be<//gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< userid>

<Review>From the time I walked in the door until I took my car home, the staff was very helpful and pleasant. Brian took the time to talk to the technician about the issues my vehicle was having. He was helpful, kept me informed about the progress and he was upfront about the costs so there were no surprises when I  went to pay. I also truly appreciate the technician looking at an alternative for my gear shift other than a $425 replacement. He simply removed a piece that was only cosmetic  and the gear shift is good as new. That was huge in my book! They could have easily charged me the $425 for a new gear shift, but they were honest and took the time to look into it more and discovered the gear shift didn't need to be replaced at all. I appreciate that so much. The shuttle was extremely convenient in getting me to and from work . The drivers were very pleasant as well. I didn't purchase my Journey at this particular dealership (I bought it from Hanford Dodge) but I will definitely seek your dealership when my car needs to be serviced again. My car has 128,000 plus miles on it but thanks to you guys, it runs and looks good as new. Thank you very much!<//Review>< Pictures>

01/2019: Jess was our service advisor. Brought our vehicle in with the early bird/late owl drop off on 01/23. Received a call first thing in the morning. Did not expect a call until later and definitely didn’t expect my vehicle to be done the same day. Both were executed with precision. I had a great experience with Jess  a 2nd time and appreciate everything she has done. She got in touch with the service contract company for repairs and requested everything that was needed. She made every effort in making sure we were taken care of. You have a great employee working for you. Great work ethic and terrific with customer service. Your company is lucky to have a great employee in her<//Review>

Eddie was our internet salesman and Reggie was our in-store salesman and I couldn't have asked for a better team. Eddie made sure we got the price he quoted and that the car was ready when we got there. Reggie made the paperwork process smooth as silk and he was a wealth of knowledge on my new car. He knew the answer to every question and gave excellent advice on things we didn't even know to ask. I give them 5+ stars and have and will continue to recommend this dealership. Thank you Lampe Dodge team, you made buying my perfect car an enjoyable process.<//Review>< pictures>

Finally on Monday I was told that I needed 2 new batteries  and I  also had to pay for the diagnostic test which mind you at any auto parts store they will do it for free.  So I bit the bullet and paid $140.00 for the diagnosis and the 2 new batteries for a total of $275.00.  This was just the tip of the iceberg,  when I asked for a shuttle to come get me I was informed that they don't have a shuttle service due to the virus and I just needed to be there to get my truck. Wow, no taxi service, no Uber or Lyft, and no one to get me to the dealership!  I ended up giving my friends daughter the money to get my truck.  All good?? Nope because I got out to my truck and it was still doing the same things and more.  Basically not working correctly.   Tuesday morning I myself drove it there a waited over 6 1/2hrs. Not fixed but runs, parts on order so see you whenever. Sitting for long periods of time my legs swell badly and I have to put them up.  When I pleaded to get a ride they didn't care. Again I sat with swollen legs and purple feet due to the bloodflow issues I have.  Couldn't care less!! What was the management team thinking when they let the  entire shuttle service go? Oh, the virus.  Now for the people who don't have a backup vehicle or live out of town or whatever the situation is Lampe has a waiting area which is full of mask wearing potentially virus passing not 6 feet away customers that would be safer at home, work, hotel wherever that is not there.  Doors got wiped down if you can call it that only once.   Not a chair was clean and just not right!  Wake up Lampe management team! Plexiglass the shuttle, sterilize it and think things through the entire way. Will get part's put in and I just might have a second chapter to this Stephen King experience!<//review><Name>Elizabeth Ewing< /Name></record>

Just bought a new 2018 Dodge Journey. The salesman J.R. was very helpful and friendly. He informed us of all the specifics of the car. He showed us around 4 different vehicles and he was able to tell us all the pros and cons of all of them, basically read our minds on what we wanted. Everyone was very helpful and friendly all the way through. I would definitely recommend them to my family and friends! And I will be buying my next car from them. Salesman J.R. was very helpful along with other salespeople during the process. It went quite smoothly. We were out of there in about 3 hours which is a record from all the previous vehicles that I purchased!< /review>

Sitting in the showroom was way too warm and muggy, almost like a sauna with a semi functional heating element, while waiting to finish paperwork. Workers were saying the person in charge of that decision was being cheap and didn't want to turn the AC on. It felt better when somebody opened the door.

Only plus side was that this dealership offered a truck price 3,000 less than a truck located in Huntington Beach with the same exact identical color and options. Eddie was cool for the internet sales part. Juan showed off the truck and was knowledgeable about it.

2 stars for the muggy showroom. The dust by the vents and the mismatched ceiling lights was a bit... off.

5 star for beating Huntington Beach prices, keeping the business local, and the knowledgable staff, specifically Juan.< /Text>

Customer service is horrible. Car went in under warranty, been in for a month no idea when it will be fixed and no help on rental or loaner. Vehicle had a factory defect with the engine. Called and got the run around. This will be the last time I purchase a Dodge or go to them for service.

I was able to get ahold of the manager, and he was very helpful. He did more in a day than the previous had done in a month. I appreciate the service<//text>

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
The Service Advisors and Parts Department usually get a Bad Rap!
Let's face it....We all think we know about cars! The fact is we sometimes need Expert Help! Well, starting with our Parts Advisor, Lewis. He was very informative and gave us Very Competitive Pricing! Thank you Lewis!
*Our Service Advisor, Brian Dunn was Awesome! Super knowledgeable, Patient & Willing to Help!
Thank you Lampe Dodge for hiring some of the Best Advisors anyone could ask for!
Ask for Brian Dunn! And No, I'm not a family member, but a New Customer and New Friend!<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Had to take my jeep in for two recalls, not only were they flexible on my drop off time, they gave me a ride home and a ride back to pick up the jeep (the employees that drove were extremely friendly and professional) I haven't seen this kind of service from any other dealership. also, they gave me a ride back to their dealership to pick up my jeep after their closing hours, I was surprised by that (90% of dealerships probably don't do that) Anyways, these guys have an amazing staff.<//Text>< Pics>

The sales manager Mike, along with two salesmen Juan and Freddy all gave excellent service as I expected.
We’ve bought 7 cars and have referred many in the past five or so years there because of your professionalism and unbeatable prices.
Although we live on the Central Coast we will always buy from Lampe as long as you stick to your high standards.
Thank you for the experience.

I went in wanting a car Joe N was not pushy he gave me my space, answered all my questions and I did not want to test drive. He didn’t seem to pressure me into doing so. He made me feel very comfortable and I went home and came back the next day because of him and purchased it. I went back the next day again and took my roommate and she got a car with him too. I recommend him so much I loved the service I received and Joseph from finance was great as well. I definitely recommend Lampe Dodge and Joe Nunez. I’m having my sister go there too.<//review>

<review>I bought a brand new Jeep Compass from this dealership. It was a long day, but, very rewarding. The salesperson was Mike Allender and he was fantastic and very patient. He didn't push me at all like other dealerships do. Chris the manager was also very helpful.  They both deserve a 15 on a scale of 1-10. Shelby was also very helpful. She also deserves 15. I highly recommend this dealership.<//review>< date>

<review>Honestly if my car didn’t have the powertrain warranty, I never would have brought it here. I have a 2016 Dodge Dart and it had no problems whatsoever in the 3 years that I’ve owned it. Great car, I love it. One day it decided to start leaking oil from the valve cover so I called Lampe dodge to see if I could take it in that day, unfortunately the nearest appointment I could make was a week and a half from when my car started to leak oil. (Keep in mind, I called as soon as it started to leak.) So a week and a half goes by, I finally take her into Lampe and was told it was going to be a maximum wait of 1-2 days. I asked before hand “how long do you think it’ll be? About a week or so?” And he told me 1-2 days after I asked that. So finally after calling every single day for 2 weeks straight, After several attempts to reach customer service, who don’t ever answer the phone and don’t call you back. Seriously, they will NEVER call you back so keep bugging them. Tried to call the service manager but he was out of town, however, he did give me a call back when he returned after I left a message and was open to what I had to say. I let him know that I was very disappointed and dissatisfied with the service they provided because I never got any updates as to what the problem was or how much longer it would be, so I was basically left in the dark for 2 and a half weeks. I love dodge don’t get me wrong, but if my car wasn’t covered under the warranty, I wouldn’t bring my car back here. It ended up being covered so I didn’t pay anything out of pocket which helped a lot.< /review><time>1543338674522< /time></record>

< review>
I took my car in there to be serviced two days ago in which I had an appointment for that morning at 9 am. My air conditioning didn’t blow cool and my oil needed to be changed. It’s a 2018 there is no reason why the car’s AC shouldn’t be working well. The guy went on saying that it felt cool to him... later that day we called and asked when the car would be ready and the service guy would just keep giving us the run around, never a clear answer. At around 5pm when the service shop closes I get a call from Lampe but it only rings twice so I think my car is ready. I called back three times and never got an answer. The next morning I called again and was asking when my car would be done and he said he didn’t know and I let him know we needed to know because both me and my wife had work that day and would have to figure out how one of us were going to get to work. We called a total of about 6 times that day and of course they never gave us a clear answer just the run around and they even hung up on my wife when they figured out who was calling. We finally picked up our car that afternoon at around 2:30 pm. After my car is done with 2 free oil changes I will never be taking it back to service again, they have no clue about customer or what they are doing. A friend of mine that bought a car from there had the same issues I had a few months back. I should have known then.</review>

Jessica was the service writer and she did an awesome job. When we return with either one of vehicles I would hope to get Jessica. She listens to the customer and puts all that in the notes. I have never had a service writer like that I really appreciated it.</text>

<Text>UPDATE!!!!!! We bought our third car from Lampe on Saturday 3/13/2021 from Juan Torres. We had originally went to get a Challenger GT that was low miles but Juan found us a brand new Challenger and we were sold. He was an awesome sells agent and Lampe will definitely be were we buy our 4th. Thank you to the entire team from sales to finance!! You guys were amazing!!!

We had an amazing salesman Ramon Garcia! He knew everything there was to know about our 2019 Jeep Cherokee latitude 4x4. We test drove a couple cars and he knew every feature the vehicle had to offer. Chris the sales financial manager worked with us with our trade and got us the highest blue book value to make sure we were not upside down. We love our Jeep and the wife and I fight over who is driving now because it's such a fun SUV packed with power and luxury.<//Text>< Pics>

I’ve gone here 3 times hoping for better service wanting to buy a Jeep. The times I’ve been helped the guys are judgy. Can a young girl not buy her own Jeep? Do you not believe in me? & when I ask about buttons and engine and those types of questions they stay quiet and cannot answer me aren’t you suppose to know about the car you’re selling me to get me sold? Like what? When I last went into Jeep I had to walk up to the circle of guys just talking. Mind you they all seen me get out of my car and none of them approached me or even welcomed me there. I had to fish for my own help as if they weren’t working and I was going out of my way for the most. Ridiculous.<//Text>

Took my car in for an oil change and to get a recall issue fixed. Got in at 9:30, the document that was given to me had a promise time of 10:15 it wasn't ready till almost 2 pm. Was I upset? Yes, because with a promise time of a little less than an hour, I decided to hang out in the waiting room. After about two hours of waiting I decided to ask when my car would be ready and that's when I was told that it might be ready by 2 or 3 pm. Their service department is pretty slow compared to other dealerships. I don't think I ever had to wait more than 45 minutes to an hour for an oil change and 1 other item. But then, their service department looked busy AF, like they never expected to have so many cars in a day to be serviced. Would I go back? ehhhh... I dislike that you cant make an appointment for an oil change, but I don't think that would change anything. The staff was nice, I can't lie about that. I'll give them another shot and my rating may change.<//Text>

Great experience at Lampe. We arrived and had at least 30 minutes to look at Jeeps before a salesman approached us which was very pleasant. Andrew was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and answered all of our questions and never pressured us to buy. The manager was very nice and professional and the Joe went out of his way to get us great financing! I will go back to buy another vehicle from Lampe before any other dealer in Kings or Tulare Counties.</review>

Quick and excellent service!! I walked into a busy waiting room, without an appointment, at 2pm on Saturday for an oil change and was told I had 4 cars ahead of me -  walked out an hour later. They also reminded me of the free oil changes I received when I bought my Jeep a few months ago, something most places hope you forget about. Nothing but great experiences at Lampe from car buying, financing and now service!!< /review>

My jeep Cherokee has had major issues since it hit 35,000 miles.  Lampert service department has been able to "update" my car and fix the problem.   There's always a new problem.  Currently waiting for a radio cluster which needs to be replaced  because it has stopped working.  Sadly, it controls the back up camera which now only operates when I'm driving forward.  I'm extremely disappointed with my jeep and will never buy another Chrysler,  Dodge,  Jeep product.< /review>

Lampe continues to impress me on each visit to the dealership. Now on my third Jeep purchase from them the services is far beyond any dealership I have worked with in the past 35 years. Everything is always trouble free at purchase and after sale is wonderful also.
Kenneth in their service department is a wonderful service writer who stays ahead of things for our two current Jeeps so there are never surprises on items needing service. Every time we drop a vehicle off we are in and out within just a few minutes which is wonderful for our schedule. During the service period we are always kept up to date on schedule so we can plan accordingly

If you are looking for Chrysler Dodge Jeep or Ram from Sacramento to LA make sure you put Lampe on the list to talk with. You will not regret it< /Text>

When I was with the financial personnel or whatever the person is that has you sign the contract asking me why did I want and what I was going to do with the truck we were trying to agree on the price. That person was getting upset because I would not take their offer. The only thing that person should be concerned about is if I can buy the truck nothing else. So due to that person’s attitude for not taking the offer I took my business to the Chevy house where I got the deal I wanted on the same size truck<//Text>

Bought the new Jeep Wrangler Unlimited JL Rubicon at this dealership. Great customer service. Chris price provided good support and took through the entire process smoothly with his team. Everyone was virtuous and friendly. Had a good satisfactory experience. It was a great buy.<//review>

Great experience at Lampe. We arrived and had at least 30 minutes to look at Jeeps before a salesman approached us which was very pleasant. Andrew was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and answered all of our questions and never pressured us to buy. The manager was very nice and professional and the Joe went out of his way to get us great financing! I will go back to buy another vehicle from Lampe before any other dealer in Kings or Tulare Counties.< /review>

<text>I had been interested in Charger Scat Packs for quite some time.  I finally decided after many visits to the dealership to buy one.  The particular model and color that I wanted was somewhat hard to find but the people at Lampe Dodge kept at it and finally I am the proud owner of a new Scat Pack Charger.  The dealership was great to work with and I would highly recommend them to anyone interested in one of the brands that they sell.<//text>< userid>

From the first phone call to handing over the keys the sales team was amazing! Lampe will change the way you shop for a car. Everyone was friendly and very accommodating. I live in Clovis but I would recommend making the short drive to Visalia if you are going to buy a Chrysler vehicle.<//review>

I recently went car shopping at Lampe in Visalia and I had a great experience. Robert answered all of my questions and helped me pick out my dream car. The customer service there is amazing they work with you on getting a great deal for your car I highly recommend you visit them if you’re in the market for a new car. Ask for Robert he’ll be more than happy to help you.< /Review>

<Text>Lampe continues to impress me on each visit to the dealership. Now on my third Jeep purchase from them the services is far beyond any dealership I have worked with in the past 35 years. Everything is always trouble free at purchase and after sale is wonderful also.
Kenneth in their service department is a wonderful service writer who stays ahead of things for our two current Jeeps so there are never surprises on items needing service. Every time we drop a vehicle off we are in and out within just a few minutes which is wonderful for our schedule. During the service period we are always kept up to date on schedule so we can plan accordingly

If you are looking for Chrysler Dodge Jeep or Ram from Sacramento to LA make sure you put Lampe on the list to talk with. You will not regret it<//Text></record>

<Review>We went here just to see what they had on the lot and they ended up having the exact car that we wanted to fit our needs (jeep grand Cherokee). Mike and Joe helped us out on the floor. Great salesmen and they did everything they could to get us the price we needed.

Andy Fedo is the finance manager who helped us out and honestly this guy is the best in the game! He got us a great interest rate and then the next day asked us to come in again because he got us an even better interest rate. Talk about going above and beyond. When buying your car, make sure to ask for Andy!< /Review>< Pictures>

Very good customer service. Puts the customer first like every business should. Had a recall that needed to be completed took a little longer than expected to get the part because another dealership had ordered it for my truck. They called me to let me know the part was in and told me I could bring it in anytime that week told them that doesn’t really work for me I would wait till it was due for servicing because I didn’t have away of going for a day while they worked on my truck well they bent over backwards to get the recall done on my truck ASAP they got me a rental until my truck was ready. I will only take my vehicles to Lampe.</Text>

Great service!If you can request Eric he was the technician that did my oil change. I had a few questions concerning my car. He answered them honestly and I even checked his work when I got home to make sure that it was correct. It was so I would recommend Eric.  I would also like to say that they were fast and the quality of work was great.</Review>

<Review>Never take your car here. Had a Jeep that was only 2.5 years old. Wouldn’t start. All the lights were on so thought it wasn’t battery. Really concerned it was something serious. It went to Lampe because of good reviews. So I get charged $50 for a diagnostic. They tell me it is the battery and want to charge me $300! Then say it could be more if they have to reset the computer. After that run around I told them I will take the Jeep back, buy my own battery. One of the technicians that gave me a jump told me all Chrysler Jeeps and Dodge Trucks have a faulty connection that eventually fails and drains the battery. Another story to get more money out of me. So I pay the $50 diagnostic and they didn’t even put air in my tires, which it says on the receipt is a California regulation. Another time I went here I brought my own oil for a change. I told them to return the oil that would be left over. It’s mobile 1 oil and expensive, I’d have a half bottle left after the change. Of course I never get the oil back. Crooks! If a manager is reading this I want my $50 diagnostic back!< /Review>< Pictures>

I have been a customer with Lampe for some time now and I have had very good experiences with the service team.  Especially Rodney who seems to be able to make his clients feel like they matter most.< /Text>

We got it jump started and once we had cell service we called Lampe service and talked to Issac who was great!! We were told to come on in. We were helped by Jerrod when we got there who was also wonderful. They told us that they would get to it quickly so we were offered a shuttle to some place to eat and a lovely lady,who we did not get her name,  took us and then came back and got us -meanwhile we were told it was just the battery and within 3 hrs we were back on the road.

Usually I am pleased with service department but this last time I was very disappointed. They tell my husband when he took it in he didn't have an appointment even though I scheduled it 2 weeks prior  because we were on vacation. They told me it could take an hour to 4 hours and my appointment was at 9:30. I had asked if it could be closer to an hour because leaving  on vacation as soon as done and we were coming from Hanford. Well it was finally finished at 5:00 and it was the Ecodiesel recall. So 7 1/2 hours later we finally got to pick it up. Very disappointed!!<//Text>

<Text>Me and my wife bought a new Grand Cherokee a few years back, our three kids love it. So far almost 100k miles and it's running like the day we drove it off the lot. We only have it serviced at Lampe and I wouldn't take it any where else. I receive better customer service here then when I take my BMW to any BMW dealer.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Lampe. Is TOP NOTCH!!! I live out of town and drive the hour and fifteen minutes past another Jeep dealership to get to Lampe.  At Lampe they treat you like family.  I meet this dealership when shopping for a new Jeep last Christmas for myself!!!! Jim, Rodney and the entire Lampe family from the sales to service has been painless and actually positive and rewarding!!! I bring my girls (dogs). and everyone there was so kind to them!!  I was out of town when locked out of my Jeep and Lampe made sure I was calm and able to get the Jeep to their facility for help immediately!   This was amazing because MOPAR actually let me bypass the other dealership who has lousy service And shady people in Hanford to get to Visalia!   Thanks Lampe for being there like a positive family I can always count on!!!!</text><Resp>None</Resp><date>1561994440385< /date><GmapID>0x8095279546bcb91d:0x297aca8f1694b2be< /GmapID>< userid>

<time>1543266710908< /time><rating>1</rating><Review>Never take your car here. Had a Jeep that was only 2.5 years old. Wouldn’t start. All the lights were on so thought it wasn’t battery. Really concerned it was something serious. It went to Lampe because of good reviews. So I get charged $50 for a diagnostic. They tell me it is the battery and want to charge me $300! Then say it could be more if they have to reset the computer. After that run around I told them I will take the Jeep back, buy my own battery. One of the technicians that gave me a jump told me all Chrysler Jeeps and Dodge Trucks have a faulty connection that eventually fails and drains the battery. Another story to get more money out of me. So I pay the $50 diagnostic and they didn’t even put air in my tires, which it says on the receipt is a California regulation. Another time I went here I brought my own oil for a change. I told them to return the oil that would be left over. It’s mobile 1 oil and expensive, I’d have a half bottle left after the change. Of course I never get the oil back. Crooks! If a manager is reading this I want my $50 diagnostic back!< /Review>< Pictures>

If you want to buy a car, SUV, truck,van or just to get some information on a car you like go to JOSEPH!!!! His customer service, and knowledge on any questions you may have will get answered, he went above and beyond for me and my husband. He did not pressure us to buy an SUV, or was negative about any anything. I got a 2017 Dodge Journey and we love it. Thank you Lampe for you having Such Amazing staff that actually do their job with Excellent service</text>

<text>EDIT...EDIT...EDIT...EDIT...EDIT...
Just when you think everything is fine.  When we signed the docs, we were told that our financing was through a local Credit Union.  I went to the credit union, opened an account excited that our financing was local.  After 3 days they contacted us stating they never received any loans for us.  I called Lampe and after days of run around, we were finally told “our loan was through Ally Financial.  When I asked what happened, I was told the paperwork for credit unions was too much and we can finance you through whomever we want.”

We stopped in on Friday 9/7/18 at about 7pm to look at a new  RAM 2500 4X4 diesel truck.  I honestly thought the dealership was closed and would browse the inventory then come back on Saturday.  We were met by Robert Bankston who was very helpful showing us only what we wanted to see.  He was very knowledgeable and answered every question we had.  He made sure to show us every different package available.  Once we had decided on a truck, the finance department shopped several different finance companies and was able to get us an outstanding interest rate.  Lampe also gave us a great deal on our trade in.  Richard Kazarian completed our deal and finished the paperwork in what I would say is record time.  Never in my life have I ever had a vehicle transaction go as smoothly or as quickly as this did.  Thanks again for the awesome experience!
Anyone interested in buying a new or used vehicle should absolutely put your trust in Lampe Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram FIAT.  They are trustworthy, polite, knowledgeable, and will treat you right!
To the owners of Lampe;  You have a stellar staff who actually care about the customer and making the vehicle purchase experience a pleasurable one.
Thanks again Robert & Richard, you guys rock!<//text>< rate>

Took my Jeep in on July 3rd and it wasn't fixed until July 18th. It cost me almost 1800.00 (over 1100.00 in labor) to fix a fuel pump and some electrical issues.  Not sure what was more upsetting, the length of time or the amount of the fix.< /Text>

<Text>Worked through a problem with the entertainment center in my 2015 Rubicon with Kenneth in service.  He was great and didn’t drop the ball once.   Very satisfied with his performance.  He is what you expect to find when you go to a dealership.    I couldn’t ask for any better service.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Rate>

<date>1552344476535</date><Rating>5</Rating><review>I bought my 2016 Chrysler 200s in January 2017.  The sales experience was okay, had some discrepancies with numbers between negotiations and finance office but the sales manager Mike came to a compromise. I’ve put 55,000 miles on my car so far in the 2 years 2 months I’ve owned it, which equates to a LOT of service visits. Lampe’s Express Oil Lane offers exceptional customer service and the timeframe to have your car in n out is pretty quick. I like that I can just drop it off on a Saturday morning and pick it up later that day with no appointment needed.  The woman at the service counter has always been super friendly and courteous to everyone she comes in contact with.  The after-sale service is important to me and I’ve gotta say Lampe does a good job.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The recall work and warranty issue was completed timely and the service writer was very helpful and friendly. The shuttle driver was awesome. Now let’s talk about the two gals that greet you at the service entrance. I say greet because I imagine that is part of the job.  Instead you get dumb looks and why are you bothering me attitude when I stepped inside and ask about my appointment as the other gal whips out a compact and touches up her makeup. These two mope around with an unenthusiastic I hate my job attitude as much as a guy serving porta potty’s at a construction job site on a 100+ degree day.  I thought it might of been a one-off experience but I’ve observed it on more than on occasion and after sharing my experience with other Dodge owners, it seems to be the norm.   I’d rather check in a an electronic kiosk and bring my own coffee than deal with the attitude.  Probably will not change because they are daughters of the owner.
Thank you</text>

Bad experience! My wife’s 2016 Jeep Cherokee would not start and I knew it was a battery however when we bought the Jeep they assured us if there is any problems call us first. We also knew her car was under warranty. Unfortunately it took two days to tell us what we already knew, it needed a new battery. The battery warranty was done at 36,000 and we were at 43,000, so basically we wasted two days while her car sat in the same place as the day before. When they do call us back of course they are overcharging so I politely pass up and tell them I would buy my own battery and put it in myself. When I went to pick the car up all the sudden I have to pay all these fees for looking at the car which is fine but when he quoted me for the battery it never included these fees. So once I said I did not want to get the battery through them they wanted to charge me for them. I paid of course and proceeded to buy my own battery and change it in their parking lot. Multiple service employees passed by and never asked to help in any way. I get it I chose not to use them but it is a Jeep and lampe is a Jeep dealership. If we all work through the same company you would think that would mean something. Stay away from lampe they do not value loyalty and I guess if you buy a car through them once the warranty is up they don’t care about you. Still haven’t heard back from our rep. Rodney he never once called to apologize. Not a good experience!<//text>

Great place to buy a vehicle new or used great customer service, I encouraged my son and daughter to buy their new vehicles from Lampe they're also quite satisfied with their experience . I'm from Hanford and chose not to do business with the local dealerships  Dodge Chrysler or Keller's Ford/Chevrolet no need to say anything else.</text>

<Review>Lampe is by far the best dealership in all respects. I purchased my second Ram 1500 Ecodiesel there and make the well worth while trip to have it serviced by their excellent service department. Nothing compares to Lampe in all respects. They set the bar for others to reach which appears to be above their capabilities. Whatever your needs are in the Ram, Chrysler, Dodge or Jeep, Lampe in Visalia is definitely the place to go.< /Review>< UserId.>

< Review>
Andy Fedo (Finance Manager) has got it going on! He gets you in and out, gives you all of your options but doesn’t shove unnecessary add-ins down your throat!
Freddy Garcia (Salesman) was very knowledgeable about the cars on the lot and was super easy to talk to and work with.
Mike (the closer) made us a great deal!
WE LOVE LAMPE! We’ve bought 2 vehicles there now and have been happy with our team both times.< /Review>

When my car was losing coolant and my car was overheating, I headed to Lampe Dodge.  I didn't have an appointment, but Rodney was able to get my car in plus he got me into a rental car for the two days that they needed to keep my car.  Awesome Customer Service!</Review>

<Review>The car buying process at Lampe was very pleasant and professionally handled. Everyone there was friendly and helpful from the salesman, Corey Engelke who allowed me to take a long test drive and the finance manager, Richard Kazarian  who did an awesome job explaining vehicle coverage and got me the best interest rate possible! I most definitely recommend Lampe auto to everyone in the market for a new or used vehicle!</Review>< Pics>

As a first time (college student) car buyer, I felt a bit intimidated to go to such a big dealership. Everyone I knew told me to check out a used dealership because the experience would be better for me, but Lampe proved my doubts wrong. Throughout my entire encounter with Lampe, my salesperson Joseph was with me the entire way! I am so happy that I was able to have an incredible first-time buyers experience. Everyone there from the sales team to the service itself, they are extremely helpful and friendly.</text>

I called the dealership over the phone asking for information on a PIN and KEY code they said no problem just bring in the registration and ID to validate I am the owner and that they will print it out for me.

I drive 10.2 miles over there and one guy complains when a lady asked him for help. She asked him if he could help me and he said when I get a chance but I was going to lunch.

Finally he finishes what he was doing which is fine...minus the complaining about his lunch.

I finally get directed to the parts desk and the gentleman tells me that it's a $25 dollar charge  for the codes.

Very very very poor service for a dealership.< /text>

The mechanic was very good.  I would give him a 4 star.  My problem is with Mr. Stillman, he gave me this big story on how a rating that gets below 80 has him not sleeping well.  He could guarantee a 25 percent discount after he called Dodge on Monday.  They gave me a bid on Friday.  I was figuring a 25 percent discount.  Picked up truck the next week,  asked if Mr. Stillman had called Dodge.  They turn so I can't read what they are saying.  Of course he already took it off.  Take what Mr. Stillman says with a grain of salt..</Text>

I have bought two pickups with Lampe dodge and the experience has been great.  They also have a great lube shop.  Can't beat the $80.00 for 3 or 4 oil change service.< /Text>

< Review>
I took my vechile into the dealership because the paint was chipping off. I bought my Charger, in March of 2018 ( new) had about 5 miles on it. On February 5, 2019 I dropped off my car because the claim was approved through my warranty. The customer service agent was polite and friendly and advice me it was going to be shipped somewhere....
The next day I was checking my vechile location and tracking if it had been driven anywhere( without my consent). My app tracked the car in a different location, about 10 mins from the dealership and it also notified me of there speeding (80mph). I found this very offensive  and unprofessional because I am paying a lot of money for my vechile that I purchased at lampe doge in visialia. I also was very polite about my car already chipping not even been a year out of purchase when I bought it new. I never complained or said anything about it. bad service. Not happy.< /Review>

I love working with either Kenneth or Rodney whenever my jeep needs service or repairs. They always call when they say they will and provide updates so you always know what is going on. They are the reason I keep coming back. Lampe also works seemlessly with Enterprise Rentals when you need a rental. They pick you up and when you need to return the car you can just leave it at Lampe. The only draw back at Lampe is service guys in the shop seem to be going through a rough patch though! Often find problems after we leave with things overlooked or just plain NOT being thorough! I think we have held management's hand to the fire long enough now that things seem to be getting a little better. Only time will tell. We will continue to use Lampe for our service due to Kenneth and Rodney, and Lampe's reasonable prices. I think it says a lot that we drive all the way from Fresno to service our vehicles there.<//text>

<Text>Dishonest sales person and unreasonable pricing. I really wanted the color they had so I drove almost 200 miles, one way, to get it but it didn't have all the features that the same car, different color, had at Hoblit. Lampe advertised theirs for $42+K while Hoblit had it for $41K. Both car are new with less than 100 miles on them, same model same everything, however, the one at Lampe didn't have the matching color finders, the roof top lining, nor the leather seats. That is ~$3K of differences. I tried to negotiate and the sales person said what they have more than others is a Life Time Warranty. I could not believe that this even exist so I asked for a document to prove it. They first gave me a print out of the regular limited warranty and when I told them its limited in time they went back and force and started to come with various excuses of why they don't have a document. One of the ridicules excuses was that the contract with Finance will have a box to check and that would give me the Life Time Warranty.  When Chris couldn't prove it he said "Trust Me." What a joke.  I had to leave the first day and drove  back the next day because I really wanted that color and thought I could maybe negotiate adding an $800 hitch installed for free to offset some of the missing features. I was willing to pay a bit more just to get this color. Chris wouldn't do that and he emphasized again about the Life Time Warranty as if its free of charge. when I pressed on the document for the warranty, he started to get defensive, then he said the GM said that on the website, so I said are you telling I have a life time warranty based on a word of mouth?. He said he'll double check then he called back and finally admitted that they don't have it. Big trap and I'm sure many people may have fallen for it. I didn't finish my second drive over and turned around, drove to Hoblit at Woodland, CA and purchased the Silver care for $41K with all the extras.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Not concerned with the customer service. Moe of how they conduct business in the service department. Had a brand new part we purchased fail. We reinstalled it and it had to be programmed. Lampe decided to charge us to reprogram the new part after we already paid to program the first part which was defective. So what your telling me is if I get 5 defective modules form you its going to cost me 120.00 times 5? Shouldn't matter who installs the part if the part is no good? Jim Manning will have our business from now on.</review>

Not concerned with the customer service. Moe of how they conduct business in the service department. Had a brand new part we purchased fail. We reinstalled it and it had to be programmed. Lampe decided to charge us to reprogram the new part after we already paid to program the first part which was defective. So what your telling me is if I get 5 defective modules form you its going to cost me 120.00 times 5? Shouldn't matter who installs the part if the part is no good? Jim Manning will have our business from now on.<//text>

<Text>Yes the service I receive when I take my car for an oil change is always quick even with multiple cars waiting for auto servicing.  The waiting area is large with many chairs and the morning news was on the TV.  Was done in about a half hour.  GREAT SERVICE!< /Text>< date>

NOT EVEN 1 STAR
Service: Don't ever take your car there.  You will be forever inconvenienced.
Sadly have to say, you cannot take a Chrysler to the Chrysler dealership for Trustworthy Quality Repairs.  I don't know what all else we can do. Why don't they have integrity to repair things when you take it in for a "Repair"   and Pay $846.  no joke. be cautious,  Seriously.. its going back for the 3rd time to see why the leak is still leaking... Y??!!!!< /review>

I would've given them a zero if I could. After scheduling an appointment two days ago for today at 8 AM. I dropped off my vehicle at the scheduled time I then receive a call at 3:15 pm telling me my vehicle has not been serviced and may now have to wait until tomorrow. Well that is unacceptable! Even if there was a possibility that they were not able to "get" to my vehicle (even though I had an appointment) they should have let me know before hand. Today was my only day off for the next week and they have completly wasted my time! I will not be returning, I would rather go out of the city then to deal with this again.< /text>

You have the greatest service person in Ken .He is very polite and really knows his stuff. While waiting for my truck I sat in the area where there is coffee and chairs I observed Ken with customers and the endless phone calls coming in. He answered the calls and kept track of vehicles coming in and out. The day was very very hectic and appeared Ken was doing 10 things at once.He never lost track or got frustrated with anyone . Ken will take the time to explain the problem with your truck and recalls in simple language. He is a great asset to your dealership. I live in Porterville and this is the third truck purchased from Lampe . Ken is the main reason I bought my truck at Lampe instead of Porterville Dodge.Looking forward to my next visit. Thanx.

buying my jeep went okay, besides the fact that I did not get any jeep gear when I bought and people usually do contacted my seller and did not hear back from them. I eventually go two hats after I did a customer survey, never heard from seller. Jeep comes with 3 free "EXPRESS" oil changes, first the two young ladies at the service desk are not friendly and do not even smile, second it is not express I have gone two times and it takes about an hour or more.<//text>

<Review>I highly recommend this dealership.  We had a DEF light come on while in Sequioa NP on vacation.  We came down to this dealership and they took care of us.  We arrived at opening at 7:30 am and were done by 9:15 am.  Our service advisor, Isaac, was friendly and kept us informed on what the problem was and what was being done to fix it.  The dealership is clean and very friendly.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Beware of the credit practices when dealing with this dealership. We were negotiating for a used vehicle and trying to make the numbers work. They SLAMMED my credit with at least 8 HARD INQUIRIES. The remainder of my credit is strong but they should have told me they were trying to make that many attempts. Otherwise the process was fine but this is going to negatively impact me for 3 years. BUYER BEWARE about these poor practices. They may have not done anything technically improper but they should have been far more clear about what they were doing "to get the payment down". Don't let them mar your credit like they did mine.</Review><Time>1513474294096<//Time><userid>113371636918368919258< /userid><gmapID>0x8095279546bcb91d:0x297aca8f1694b2be<//gmapID><response>{'time': 1513615694725, 'text': "Hello Mr. Veasy I am very sorry that you feel we did anything to slam your credit. It is true that we do our best to get you the best deal we can and we will work with several lenders for you. There is something that a lot of people don't realize, when you are shopping for a loan for education, vehicles, or a home you are encouraged to shop around so your score is only hit once in a 30 day period. So that means if there are 8 inquiries within 30 days to finance a car you are only dinged for one. Here is a link to further explain how that works. http://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/multiple-inquiries-when-shopping-for-an-car-loan/\nI hope this helps and puts you at ease.

<Text>Took our family 2012 dodge caravan in on Friday to be worked on due to check engine light which they figured out the issue quick which was covered under warranty. Said it will be done Monday afternoon and apparently I had to get my own rental car... Monday van was not done, Tuesday van was still not done due to someone calling in sick which then they decided to get me a rental after I've been paying for 4 days out of pocket, then wenensday still not done and finally Thursday night it was finished which we were able to pick it up. Next day my wife was driving and the air conditioning was not working and I checked the freon and looked over to make sure everything looked good and found that they didn't hook up the compressor wire harness was not hooked up which I did and fixed the issue. All together glad car is fixed but rental costed me a lot of money and having to finish the work myself is unexceptional.< /Text>< pics>

Worst experience I have even had trying to buy a truck! Don't go there! Customer service sucks. I've bough three truck and these people made me feel like my credit wasn't good enough as the other guys cash. First come first serve don't matter to them. It's what's in your wallet again I will never go to this dealer ever again</Text>

< review>
Danny the person who did the "approval" basically made us feel like we weren't worthy of trying to make a deal. He offered us something outrageous. We were basically kicked out and made it seem like they didn't care to make a deal. We ended up going to Madera Jeep the following day. Including the great service we received there,we also found out that the deals Danny was trying to stick us with were a totally bogus. He never inquired a bank approval of any sort. Who does that?? It made me furious but at the same time greatful he did that because I received a great interest rate, a great payment, more perks and the Jeep I wanted. Count on that whoever I know will hear this story. I'm sorry you have employees that don't represent your company like they should.<//review>

<Text>I desperately needed a better car.  I visited Lampe to check out a used car.  However, I did not qualify for that vehicle.  Instead, I qualified for a new Dodge Journey.  Brian, David and Shelbie worked together to apply a large rebate as a down payment, qualifying me for the loan and the new car.</Text>< Time>

Very Dishonest. The salesman named JR Infante'  told me he would get me a smoking deal. once it came to it he left  and his manage came over to give the MSRP  price with the tax included. I asked about rebates and he told me they were already included. Very Shady. I would note recommend anyone to go there.</Text>

I brought in my 2008 Jeep Rubicon for a safety recall on the steering column airbag clock spring, and a check engine light  Monday Jan 16th 2017.  THREE DAYS LATER ! , it was done,  with a new Catalectic converter system installed.  The first thing I noticed was my clutch now chattered. BAD.  And its only two weeks old. Who ever test drove it ,  FRIED my new clutch. The horn now doesn't work, and the exhaust now has a loud rattle.   An hour later,  as my wife and I are driving it down HI way 198,   the new "CAT" system they installed caught fire, and filled the inside of the Jeep with  nasty choking smoke, and fumes.  I pulled over looked under the Jeep and the mechanic, failed to remove the paper decals from the "CATs"  .  and two of them were burning.   So I jumped back in , and drove it through a water puddle next to the HI way.   When I called John ,who was the service rep , he thought it was funny, stating " boy I bet that stunk" .   Not realizing  or caring how dangerous this is.  He said , Well make another appointment, and we will take a look at that Airbag clock spring, its under warranty.     I will NEVER  RETURN .</text>

<user_name>Dan Williamson< /user_name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Terrible experience trying to buy a new truck from this dealership.  After a visit, several emails, and phone conversations with the sales person and sales manager, I was never able to get to a price they wanted to charge for the vehicle I was interested in.  The only thing I ever got from them was " how much do you want to pay every month".

After finally telling them that I would go no further with the negotiation without a price ( 3 days ), they then told me the truck I was interested in was no longer available.  They would need to go find an alternate, similar vehicle.  2 days has gone by without a word.

My take is that if you aren't willing to play their games when buying a vehicle, they don't want to have anything to do with you.  Save yourself the time and aggravation and drive over to Selma, Hanford, or Fresno.  That's what I'm doing.</Review>< GmapID>

Greatly dissapointed, feels like a stab in the back. I heard of this dealership screwing people over, but wanted to give them a chance. First time i been there they did a good job because my motor engine was covered my insurance and just yesterdsy when i left my car the guy i was tslking to sounded like he didnt want to be there and didnt have any customer service at all. When i got my car back, the problem was fixed, however at the cost of my speedodemeter not reading my speed and etc. (Know my engine is not covered by insurance)... They fix the problem but cause 2 other problems to occur. NEVER leaving my car here again. Completely dissatified. As a friend and someone who was looking for honest people to fix the problem and continue on with my routine. DONT COME, BETTER OFF ANYWHERE ELSE.<//Text>
