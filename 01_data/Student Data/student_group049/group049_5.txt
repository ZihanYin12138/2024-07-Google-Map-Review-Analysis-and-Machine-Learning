I have been to the office several times and I know quite a few people who work here and have worked here. The office is very friendly and everyone is very helpful. I love the environment and everyone I know who works here is so happy. I can vouch that it is not a scam! I've known Melissa the HR manager for many years and she loves this company, she really cares about her employees and takes pride in the company. I plan on applying myself this is a great place to start your career 😊< /Text>

The people kept me enthusiastically interested but overall they didn’t give me a proper check they actually took some of my money from each check. I couldn’t be friendly with my manager that was training me and actually hired me on. The owner actually took away my personal first check and took of 150 dollars flat and then later on told me it was a business check and didn’t work after a set time. Like I have bills to pay and other responsibilities but honestly this company just kept messing with me. Taking my earned money. 5stars bcuz it was the best experience I had with my earnings.

I've been in retail management for seven years before coming to Telecom Solutions. I've built great relationships through developing people,  but have always felt limited by corporate business. My time spent at Telecom Solutions has taught me how to challenge my mind and body while working towards my goals for financial freedom and personal development. I'm excited for what the next few months brings through advancement and growth with this company.<//text>

The Management Training Program has taught & developed me into a becoming a great people person, leader, helped me improve on my self management, and most importantly taught me to be a better person. The pay is great, making well over 1.5K weekly. Can't wait to see what 2017 will bring us!</Review>< Pics>

<review>The people there are friendly and definitely want you to succeed. It does require a lot of work and you have to be very self-motivated, but like any other job, if you want to be successful you must put in the work. It offers a lot of opportunities but at the end of the day, you have to be the one accomplishing your own goals.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c3314879b108e7:0x65dc6cf85c0a1231<//GmapID></record>

I love this place because they offer opportunities of a lifetime. Everyone starts off entry level because it's a management training program so even if you have ever been a manager, you've never been a manager at Telecom, so you need to be trained in this system. I appreciate all of the hard work and dedication Alex and Stacey are putting forth at this location.<//Review>

You operate as if you are running your own business, there is money to be made here, but expect to pull long hours and stand a lot.  This is a position for the young and naive or those with little to no skills.  Any of you with marketable skills, I would suggest going in and talking with them and see if this is a good fit for you.  It wasn't for me, but you could be a lot more successful.  They seem to have an encouraging culture, and will help you to become successful, but it's a cold sales position.  Keep that in mind.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>I've been working for the company for five weeks and for the first time in about 20 years I finally found a company that when they say they care about your success and will help you move up they actually do. The work is very rewarding I love working with my customers and seeing the enjoyment and the Gratitude on their faces when I've helped them get the best quality services that they can while at the same time saving them money has been part of the most rewarding aspects of this job. Thank you Alex, Stacy, and the rest of the team.</Text>< rate>

<review>This review is targeting people who are considering employment with telecom solutions inc. This company has been reported to the federal trade commission for employment fraud because of false job advertisements, and misinformation.
This company is a pyramid scheme and multi level marketing scam. I post this review purely to help protect people from this scam. Protect yourself, and do your research, and be aware of fraudulent employment scam.</review>< name>

This is a scam. Scam alert. Don't go becuase your wasting time and energy. I went to 3 interviews from 3 diffrent companies working out of the same adress. All they have to offer is pep talks and lolly pops. Minus the lolly pops.</Review>

Horrible company went for an interview the first one seemed promising. The next day I went for a second round and they gave me the run around changed almost everything I had discussed the previous day and made me feel very uncomfortable. I do not recommend this company to anyone the account managers are rude and very pushy. Zero stars if I could.<//review>

Worked there for two weeks. I became homeless police took my car had nowhere to go so I quit the job. I was being trained and only got two days on my own so I  only did 10 cellphones but I was promised a training pay. Well I went to pick up the money they owed me to find out I was only getting paid the 10 phones. Albert if you see this you know your wrong for what you did I forgive you because that the right this to do but I been through a lot and you doing that really made me not care about Raza no more thanks for showing me how cruel people could be.

I have been to the office several times and I know quite a few people who work here and have worked here. The office is very friendly and everyone is very helpful. I love the environment and everyone I know who works here is so happy. I can vouch that it is not a scam! I've known Melissa the HR manager for many years and she loves this company, she really cares about her employees and takes pride in the company. I plan on applying myself this is a great place to start your career 😊</text>

The people kept me enthusiastically interested but overall they didn’t give me a proper check they actually took some of my money from each check. I couldn’t be friendly with my manager that was training me and actually hired me on. The owner actually took away my personal first check and took of 150 dollars flat and then later on told me it was a business check and didn’t work after a set time. Like I have bills to pay and other responsibilities but honestly this company just kept messing with me. Taking my earned money. 5stars bcuz it was the best experience I had with my earnings.

<Review>I've been in retail management for seven years before coming to Telecom Solutions. I've built great relationships through developing people,  but have always felt limited by corporate business. My time spent at Telecom Solutions has taught me how to challenge my mind and body while working towards my goals for financial freedom and personal development. I'm excited for what the next few months brings through advancement and growth with this company.< /Review><Name>Marc Urenia< /Name>< pics>

The people there are friendly and definitely want you to succeed. It does require a lot of work and you have to be very self-motivated, but like any other job, if you want to be successful you must put in the work. It offers a lot of opportunities but at the end of the day, you have to be the one accomplishing your own goals.</text>

<Review>I love this place because they offer opportunities of a lifetime. Everyone starts off entry level because it's a management training program so even if you have ever been a manager, you've never been a manager at Telecom, so you need to be trained in this system. I appreciate all of the hard work and dedication Alex and Stacey are putting forth at this location.</Review><pics>None</pics></record>

This is an entry level sales position that requires you to set up a booth at a location and get people to buy cell phone service plans.  You operate as if you are running your own business, there is money to be made here, but expect to pull long hours and stand a lot.  This is a position for the young and naive or those with little to no skills.  Any of you with marketable skills, I would suggest going in and talking with them and see if this is a good fit for you.  It wasn't for me, but you could be a lot more successful.  They seem to have an encouraging culture, and will help you to become successful, but it's a cold sales position.  Keep that in mind.</text>

I've been working for the company for five weeks and for the first time in about 20 years I finally found a company that when they say they care about your success and will help you move up they actually do. The work is very rewarding I love working with my customers and seeing the enjoyment and the Gratitude on their faces when I've helped them get the best quality services that they can while at the same time saving them money has been part of the most rewarding aspects of this job. Thank you Alex, Stacy, and the rest of the team.</review>

This review is targeting people who are considering employment with telecom solutions inc. This company has been reported to the federal trade commission for employment fraud because of false job advertisements, and misinformation.
This company is a pyramid scheme and multi level marketing scam. I post this review purely to help protect people from this scam. Protect yourself, and do your research, and be aware of fraudulent employment scam.< /Review>

Worked there for two weeks. I became homeless police took my car had nowhere to go so I quit the job. I was being trained and only got two days on my own so I  only did 10 cellphones but I was promised a training pay. Well I went to pick up the money they owed me to find out I was only getting paid the 10 phones. Albert if you see this you know your wrong for what you did I forgive you because that the right this to do but I been through a lot and you doing that really made me not care about Raza no more thanks for showing me how cruel people could be.

< review>
I started with this company (Telecom Solution Inc) about two year ago in the Managment Training Program. This company has taught me about self managment, communication skills, leadership roles, from staying orginzaied to team building. The managment training program has developed me into the manager I am today. I am currently a CEO for my business in Orange County InStep Managment Group thanks to Alex and his orginzation.</review>

< review>
My vehicles have collectively been broken into 5 times in just 6 months. The garage management says they have no culpability and have no plans to increase security, add cameras, etc. After $10,000 in damages and loss, we're looking for other options but finding it nearly impossible in the city.
Some people have even put signs in their windows saying there is nothing in their car worth breaking into for.  It's ridiculous.
Avoid this garage if you value your vehicle and belongings.< /review>

I stopped by Diplomat Cigars while in town on business. The staff was very friendly and made some great recommendations. They have a great selection of smokes, and a lounge for smoking what you buy there. This is the closest Cigar Lounge to Downtown that I could find. I enjoyed my time there. It’s an easy walk from your downtown hotel.< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I just moved to DTLA and stopped in here yesterday. Went to the back to the humidor to grab my smoke and was told I had to leave the humidor cause the guy was ‘already helping someone’ and couldn’t let me in.

This place is in a great location and has character but could really use some TLC from the owner. Just not a welcoming place nor would I want to hang out and smoke a cigar there in the smoking lounge.<//Text>< Pics>

My coworker and I stopped in for a cigar after a really good sushi dinner, and were very glad that we stopped in.  The selection was very good, the service was fantastic, the workers were very friendly, and we ended staying for a couple of hours enjoying a good stogie and some good conversation.  Stop in, if you like smoking a good cigar after dinner...or whenever.<//Review>

Updated Review : The owner actually came in about 5 minutes after I crossed the street to the other side. So I decided to go back again to the shop. It’s an old store. Good selection of cigars. Pricing is okay (not good bargain but not ridiculously expensive either).  TV and sofa. Water and sodas are available for sale.

Previous Review :

I am here in front of the shop at 12:37pm and it is closed!!!!!!  Walked 15 minutes here for no reason. Terrible.</review>

I enjoy smoking at this cigar lounge, and then go next door to Wokcano for some great sushi.  I love their inexpensive house blend rolled by a cigar roller rolling them right there in the store, and it's quite entertaining to watch.  If you want to get a super great deal on cigars, their box prices are much better.  Sam is a funny guy too and at times quite entertaining.<//Text>

This place is a landmark in down town Los Angeles.  I have been going to this shop for several years now.  Sam the owner is a nice guy, and a character, and once you get to know him, he can be quite entertaining.  Great selection of premium cigars and a comfortable lounge to smoke in.  The prices might be a bit higher on a single cigar purchase to smoke in the lounge but the box prices are pretty low.<//Text>

<Text>Great place to take a break, enjoy a cigar, and have a good conversation. Chairs are comfy, the selection is pretty good, and the staff is great especially the young guy I think he is ex military super helpful and upbeat. Wish there were more places like this.<//Text>< rate>

Their salads are huge & very reasonable.  They also make wonderful sandwiches on those days you don't feel like cooking. Everything there is always fresh.  Yummy also carries Better Half (unsweetened) coconut cream/almond milk that I can't find in most grocery stores.  I love it because it doesn't change the flavor of my coffee. Also the young folk who work there are quite friendly.  They know all us regulars by name.< /Review><Date>1562175586464< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Small grocery store. There's a deli where you can order salads, sandwiches and baked goods. They deliver within 30min. Great for last minute items.<//text>

Best sandwiches anywhere.
Everything fresh top quality.
I love this place. But not in a gay way.
Not that there's anything wrong with it.

<text>Fresh sandwiches made fresh to order. I always get their Tuna Sub with fresh organic  greens and tomatoes.  You can taste the difference.  $7.50 worth it. Also has healthy food snacks like dried Papaya, and other healthy alternatives.<//text>< gmap_id>

<text>Le Beau has it all. For a small grocery store, they have a ton of selection at fair prices. The food is high quality, especially the produce. Their deli has some of the best sandwiches in SF. Highly recommend the Turkey Butta. There is also a nightly dinner special if you need a quick fix for dinner. Lastly, the service is fantastic. The staff is friendly and helpful. Overall a great spot in CA.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<review>I'm not sure where they are at the moment as server is down. Anyway, quality stuff at reasonable prices--to the previous reviewer--given the fact they do the shopping and deliver it to your door. There is a delivery charge, but it's nominal. Remember to tip.

While it's true that selection is too limited, it still beats walking up and down aisles with a cart and then spending 20 minutes in line waiting to pay, unless you go to Gelson's, where prices are also high.<//review><userid>108755935394256672256</userid>< time>

< review>
After years of being a customer, a hurried delivery driver backed into my wife's car in the parking lot and damaged it badly.  In the driver's own defense it was just an accident; he apologized and said it was his bad, asked if my wife was okay, and then went to get a manager hoping he wouldn't be fired.  However, when he came back out the manager was in tow and she was speaking for him and had a different sorry stating that it was suddenly "both of our faults."  I really feel they tried to pressure my wife, and I don't appreciate it.  I wish they had just done the honest thing and we could still be customers, but instead we now will be using Amazon Prime Now for our one-hour grocery shopping, and if their insurance fights the claim we will also (sadly) talking with legal counsel about remedying the situation.<//review>

Horrible!!!! I have used them numerous times only because I didn't want to drive or walk to the store....always disgusted w how expensive they are!!!!! Today i  placed an order with my credit card that they had on file but i could not find the card. When the guy came to my door 10 minutes later after the person who took my order said it would be 30 minutes and to find it by then I could not find my card.  They would not give me my order and they left yet I was billed on my credit card...... I will never call them again and I will tell all of my friends to never call them again and write bad reviews on Yelp disgusting company.  I just found out star liquor store on Main Street delivers in till 2 in the morning< /text>

I really don't understand why you would ever shop here. It's like paying 2X for things that are already 2X the cost, it's very stupid. The delivery side of things makes sense but shopping here is a waste of your cash.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Went here on a lunch break from work, I asked them to put everything in my burrito. Once at the end of the line they realized it was too big to wrap my burrito and they looked shocked, like an important asked was failed to be accomplished. They asked if it was okay to put my open burrito in a bowl and I said of course. I ate it with my pocket knife in my car and it was the best burrito bowl I’ve ever had. 5 stars. Sick employees. Big burrito. Love it #dangthatsareallybigburritointhatbowl< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Went to this place with my brother who lives in the Mission. This is one of his favorites!! It was definetly delicious!!! The line was a bit long but totally worth it. You get to see them make all the food in front of you, and there are over 15 employees working at a time because this place is always crowded. The line was long but the food came out quickly once ordered. Their burrito was delicious!!!! Would totally recommend. One of the best burritos in SF!!<//Review><time>1613537195489</time><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>114362577777370335442< /UserId.>< name>

Went for a veggie bowl(usual) saw they now have new cauliflower rice. The server says try it really selling it. Get to the register and was charged $2.00 extra for the cauliflower rice. Wish she had told me that before I added it to my bowl. But she told the lady ordering after me that the cauliflower rice was extra. Like really?</Review>

Usually it's an ok experience here but today it just wasn't the cashier's day I guess and she let us have it with her attitude 🤷🏻‍♀️😢 on top of that they burned my quesadilla it was extremely over done all dry and hard on the edges and she still charged me separately for it 😩 we had payed for three drinks and when we asked for the other two she wanted to charge us again but we showed her the receipt and she rolled her eyes and handed us the cups all in a bad mood 😞 I don't understand why it's not part of the training to learn how to leave your problems outside of work and learn how to give the best possible customer service. I've noticed several business including chipotle locations have this issue 😞 but I understand we are all humans and perhaps it just wasn't the lady's day today. Sorry that's why I gave it a three totally ruined our lunch experience for today.</text>

There is big line but goes fast. They put less meat inside everything. I had a big order and non of us get enough meat. I eat from other places same stuff too and same price they never miss that much meat. Nachos was so soft. I order super burrito there is no sour cream no Guatemole everything is extra. I dont like that.</text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Worst Chipotle I’ve ever been or seen. My steak bowl was half empty and I asked to at least add some more rice and look at amount of lettuce on my bowl. From my understanding, they basically were trying to avoid prep work. Also when I did find a fork in utensils area the guy at register very unfriendly told me that they have only spoons. I don’t really mind using a spoon, but the way he said that was like I’m asking about a ticket to the Moon. Bad management. Very disappointed!<//Review>< Pictures>

Normally wouldn't post but I felt the portions were much smaller than usual. The server making my burrito was rude and wrapped my burrito in such a way that I had to unwrap and rewrap it myself when I got home.

Cashier was very nice and even gave me an apologetic look when the server kept ignoring me.</review>

Lines can get long and so can the wait for your food, especially during happy hour when their prices drop for tacos ($1.50)  from 3pm to 5pm, so I wouldn't go here if your looking for something quick on a lunch break but other than that they've got decent food for a cheap price!<//text>

From the teammate getting annoyed when I ask for extra beans or veggies. To when I ask for a couple more napkins and the girl says “there’s napkins in the bag” Im like “I know, I saw the two napkins but im going to eat at the park and would like a few more.”  Then she rolls her eyes.  Unfortunately this incident took place yesterday, 8/20/2020.  Going to Chipotle is the most human interaction I get these days aside from work zoom calls.   I just dont want to have it get to the point where it’s just awkward and I dont wanna go there.  If we could get a regional to hone in on this store on Sunset and do some training.

Should be called "Chipotle Tacos & Burritos" because that's all they have. Some locations don't even have tacos. There are no fajitas, no fish, no enchiladas, etc., nothing you'd expect from a place calling itself a Mexican Grill. Ingredients are fresh and delicious. Cafeteria-style service is quick.< /text>

I just ordered them off of Postmates and they decided to completely forgo the kids meal I ordered for my son, no container, drink, chips, or side of bean and rice. Just a tiny quesadilla wrapped in foil even though that is not what I ordered at all. Sorry, I worked at malls and I work retail now, this is annoying and just lazy employees not doing their jobs. I should know, I have to pick up the slack for people like this at work all the time. This is why I don’t order from Postmates and also it’s why I have not had chipotle in over a year. The location at the mall I used to work at used to pull stuff like this all the time.< /text>

<review>I'm not knocking Chipotle - I enjoy a chipotle meal every once in a while. But if I were to pick a location, this would be the last spot I ever go to. The chances that the staff get your order right are about 50/50. Ordering to deliver is even more sketchy.< /review><user_name>Jason Merrill< /user_name><userid>118324550272728387748</userid>< rate>

Employees have always been friendly.  Never seen much of a line here when I go after 8pm.  It's clean and has a restroom.  Solid Chipotle location for sure.</text>

<Text>The flavor always remains consistent. I'm not a vegetarian or worse, vegan, but love the sofritas. I treated myself to the barbacoa. It was well worth it. I recommend it.< /Text>< pictures>

It's fast food chain restaurant. The food is clean and taste good. For quick bite it's fine but for dine in and go with friends not really the place.< /Review>

I've been here a few times simply because it would be quick. I've regretted it everytime. The meat is cold, they all serve you old rice and give you an attitude about anything. I watched an elderly woman order a burrito after I did and much like my burrito the girl making it destroyed it ENTIRELY. The older customer asked her politely if she could wrap it again and the employee scoffed at her and tried to convince her to get a bowl instead.</Text>

Delicious but the parking is aggressive and not logical.  They need to take some of the pick up spots and just make it chipotle customer parking only spots. People create their own spaces and is a bit dangerous.  My boyfriend and I swore we wouldnt come here again but we did because we were checking an apartment near by and that's the pla e we agreed on. We realized it once we got around to the parking lot. Also prepare 30 dollars for 2 people.  Not too bad but also not so great either.<//Review>

Went in for dinner... no one in line.... one employee in the back, another by the cash register and 2 eating at the tables. No one ask if they could help me. I waited for 5 minutes and ask the lady at the front for help, she turned around and yelled she was working. I left. Horrible customer service. Not going back there.</text>

<Text>not going to lie the food is good and all but since there young kids all they do is give you attitude no matter what and they always destroyed my burrito every time I go there but honestly though the MANAGER should really talk to them and stop giving the customer attitude, like if they don’t want to deal with people or redoing their order then they should leave😂</Text>< name>

I had a good experience here. I needed a crown and they were able to see me right away. Everybody was very kind and concerned about my welfare and comfort. I would thank everybody, but I remember Inna who booked my appointment and got me in quickly for my appointment and Andrea who cleaned my teeth and was very friendly. The doctor who worked on my teeth and the assistant were great also. Thanks for the tooth!< /review>

<review>When I first arrived at Smile Time Dental, I was a little confused in where the building was, but when I talked to the front desk employee over the phone she told me that they share their building with an orthodontics company.
Overall, I had a great first time experience. The employee that took my x-rays and Dr. Monica checking my teeth were all great! Inna, the tooth consultant, was also helpful and nice when we talked about the next steps in care.
I would recommend coming here and getting your teeth checked.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The best dental care I've had. Dr. Monica is incredibly skilled. All of my fillings have been fast, clean, and the least painful possible. The staff have all been consistently caring and accommodating. It's really the best, I highly recommend it!< /Review>

<Review>I have the worst fear every time I go to the dentist. I've been to some places where they don't really show good customer service, they're more concerned about getting you in and out so they can make more money. Smile Time Dental is different. They are very nice, they take the time to explain everything, and they are pretty gentle with their work. Honestly they are the only place I will ever go to from now on. They make going to the dentist easier and more relaxing.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><username>Danielle Shultz<//username><UserId.>108446863588073456678<//UserId.>< gmap_id>

< Review>
UPDATE/AFTER: The office informed me that they have a system to where you are not connected with an office rep at your specific location every time. If your office doesn’t pick up the phone, it goes to whatever rep is available since they have multiple sites in different cities. Margo doesn’t work for the Citrus Heights office. Carolina apologized for the phone rep’s behavior.

BEFORE:

I really wanted to go here. All of my appointments were scheduled, and the most important one has to be rescheduled because one of the dentists cannot make it to the office at that time. That is understandable. The clerk told me I couldn’t be seen until April. It is February and I have lesser dental appointments at that same office in April. I told her that the dentist and dental assistant of the office informed me that the rescheduled appointment is the work that I need to have done before my other work. They told me as soon as possible, that’s why I had it scheduled for this week. I asked if there were any other dentists in the building besides the two mentioned because the office manager told me a couple of days ago that there were many dentists at their office. MARGO, whoever that is, had an attitude and told me I can reassign myself to another office and that I had to call my insurance. She didn’t say those exact words. She said it more rudely before even checking for other dentists. That’s extremely rude to just jump the gun and tell a client to reassign themselves somewhere else. I was telling her what the dentists and dental assistants told me, and she had the nerve to tell me to go elsewhere. I am on my way to the office right now to tell them to cancel everything and to give me my X-rays so I can go somewhere else. Customer service is THAT important. Start speaking to people correctly over the phone. You’re supposed to be helping them, not giving attitude and hindering them.<//Review>

Alright, buckle up, cause this is about to be super detailed....... :)

First off, I'm just so thankful that I chose this specific location. Even though it was an hour drive for me from Stockton, it was absolutely worth going out of my way for, for the amazing experience I got today.

I've seen a couple of the more sour reviews and it shocks me a bit, so if you're new and considering a visit, I'm confident you'll be taken care of. I was nervous as HECK since it's been well over a decade since I last stepped foot in a dental office, but they were ALL so considerate and gentle and caring, which helped to ease the anxiety so much.

I was the 1st patient in at opening (the earlier, the better, IMO). Yadira at the front desk immediately complimented me on my hair and that instantly made me smile and feel comfortable off the bat. Everything was explained clearly as far as what was going to take place for this visit and I only sat to wait for a few minutes before Julissa took me back for some X-rays. She took my temperature, was super chill and got me through that process fairly quickly.

Then, after just a tiny bit of a wait, Lynden (the hygienist, I believe), came over to take a closer look and she was the absolute sweetest!!!! I explained a couple of my concerns and she surprised me with some positive feedback (which literally brought me to tears because I was expecting way worse news).

Next, the doctor (Alix) came over (again, no real wait) and she was so, so kind. She could see I was emotional and showed care right away. It was just a few more minutes of another thorough look-over and she reassured me that everything was going to be okay. She asked if I had any questions and then went on her way after I thanked her!

Julissa then walked me over to Inna's office, where we got into the insurance stuff. Honestly, this portion was the highlight of today's visit. She was SO personable from the start of our conversation that I almost forgot where I was, haha. How can someone make something tedious or boring a good time? I have no clue, but she did. She was like the cherry on top of the whole experience, honestly. We had a great conversation while she efficiently walked me through the details of scheduling and cost and coverage, etc. etc. She got my appointments set in a jiffy, explained how and what needed to happen moving forward, and sent me on my way as a happy gal.

I know I didn't get any work done yet, but for someone who has lost confidence in her smile for a while, I left cheesing over the the good news and the sincere care I already got on visit #1! They didn't treat me any less than for having Denti-Cal. I felt so taken care of and welcomed and I'm excited to come back in for all of my appointments. Haha, who would've thought that I'd be happy to go to a dentist!!? Idk guys, this place is awesome and like I said, I'm super thankful I gave them a shot.

A big, fat thanks to the staff for making my day! You guys rock at what you do + hope you all have the BEST day too ;)< /review>

I had an appointment here that I booked 2 weeks out as I had to request time off work. They called me the day of my appointment at 8 in the morning, when my appointment was scheduled for 12:30, to tell me they will need to reschedule. They asked if I could come in the next day which is ridiculous, who has a job that allows them to take time off with that short of notice? I declined their offer to reschedule. I will be finding a different provider. Calling to cancel an appointment 4 hours before the scheduled time when it has been booked for over 2 weeks is completely unprofessional. The receptionist was nice enough but the management here needs to figure out some time/scheduling management skills.</review>

The xrays were painless and Warren did an excelent  job.
The hygienist Lynden was so friendly and gentle.
When the assisant Avelon came in for the exam she was so sweet and broke down all my concerns to Dr Carlos who reviewed everything I was worried about.
Everyone was attentive and understanding of my anxieties when it comes to going to the dentist. Especiallu for the first time since the Covid shut downs.
At the end of the appointment Inna broke down everything with my insurance and left me with no questions regarding my treatment.
Thank you Smile Time for being the best dentist ive ever been to :)< /Review><Time>1620770908698<//Time>< pics>

I would not recommend them AT ALL, before I came into this office, I asked for them to run my Insurance # to see if it covers for their office, and it Did. But boy was there a turn to this when I first came in they asked did I want to receive the Exam where it's a small fee [not sure what it is called ] I respectfully declined. So I get my exam and we go over everything that I will need to have done, as we are going over my paperwork I asked what would be covered and what would not be, the young lady explained if I need further procedure is done that would cost but wasn't sure until I had it exam from a specialist. A year ago I had some dental work done that I am going to need again that was Free and under the same Insurance I have now. So the dentist calls me and leaves a message about the work I would need to be done that I had received a year ago, I return her call and she proceeds to tell me a large fee I will have to pay, which is normally free and I respectfully mention to her I need to call my insurance and discuss why that is not covered anymore we hung up the phone, I call my insurance and asked why it's not covered and I was told everything is covered by my insurance so they are not understanding why they are trying to charge me. I still need some filling's done and was still willing to come in and receive the other work that was covered until whatever issue was worked out for my insurance to pay, I have called numerous times for them to return my call and they have yet to do so. So what I am getting from them is because I did not want to pay from my pocket for something that is covered on top of what I may need after the specialist from my pocket, they do not want to continue to do the service anymore</review>

This Dental Office sucks. I signed up as a new patient and they took x-rays and oral screening and charged me $35. Then for over one month I waited and waited. This incompetent dental office did not even sent the pre authorization to my dental plan. Go somewhere else.<//text>

<Review>The dentists here are great. However the administrative side is terrible. Getting a referral to an endodontist from them was a nightmare. You get given a treatment plan after your first visit with a list of procedures and prices per visit. Then, in my experience, the throw that completely out the window. This place needs to get its house in order.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
If I could give zero stars I would choose that option. We started going here last year, and we were very unhappy after our first appointment. To begin with, we made our first cleaning appointments for ourselves and our son. When we got to the appointments they spent 10 minutes looking at our teeth and then made appointment for cleaning. I was mad at the time as I have never gone to a dentist that requires an appointment for checking teeth, and the an appt, for cleaning. We made the follow up appointments however and they had told my husband that his appointment would a cleaning and a filling, and they didn’t not do the filling and forced him to make another appointment. We decided to give them the benefit of the doubt as they were newly open at that point, and we made appointments for cleaning 6 months later. Again, they tried to do the inspection and X-rays and the cleaning in 2 separate appointments. My husband needed a crown and a filling and paid in advance. Every appointment they kept trying to charge him again, and he kept telling them he had paid in advance. 5 months later, we received a bill for additional charges, even though he had paid in full in advance!! Every single appointment we had with them they messed up the billing, charged us after the fact incorrectly. They also tried to force my not even 3 year old to sit through X-rays and got mad at me when I told them no! We gave them several chances and the benefit of the doubt multiple times, but we are done. Would NOT recommend!!!<//Review>

This is a very friendly office and done in a quickly matter. Dr. Alex actually took the time to show her care for my teeth and explained what i needed done. Kailey had wonderful customer service which really matters in this world and makes a difference. She explains whatever needs to be done and even prints in out for you. She even suggested other options if you can't pay, which was really awesome. I lime this dentist and I would definitely recommend! :) ps. They even have t.v. on the top when they are checking your teeth. So convenient! ;)< /Review>

DO NOT GO TO THIS DENTIST!
I was driving to my appointment today that was at 2pm and the entire 80 freeway was closed to one lane due to an 18 wheeler that got turned over. I called to let them know i was running a few minutes late due to the accident and by the time kayla answered the phone (on hold) it was 2:12 pm and i was pulling into the parking lot. Kayla then proceeded to tell me there is a note on my file saying if im more than 10 min late to reschedule,  i then asked why a first time customer would have a note like that and she changed her story and said there is a 10 min late policy supposedly. The point of this little story is that i wasted nearly an hour driving here all to be lied to by a receptionist and waste a couple hours of my time just to not be seen.<//Text>

<Text>Dr Monica Marquez DDS has been INCREDIBLE!!!
I have had 4 different dental visits with her to repair and replace older filling and I have been pleasantly surprised on how delicate and painless she has made it. Every time that she has given me shots for the numbing process it has been absolutely painless in comparison to pass dentist that I’ve been to and I have been shocked with how well she was able to level out the filling so my bite feels perfect! A+ work Dr Monica Marquez and staff!
I’ll be seeing you all again soon!< /Text>< user>

Update: nice to know your office just drops people when they give a bad review. Good for keeping your rating up if you just remove everyone who says anything bad about you. *****Went in to have a sore tooth looked at and went through there new method of letting people in only to be met with no one in the place and no sign or information on how to sign in or even if I had to sign in. After standing in the waiting room for 15 minutes I finally got to see a real person only to be rushed through my appointment and given a prescription for a medication that no pharmacy in the area carries. When I called back to have the doctor change it to a more  available option I was told the doctor was with a patient and they would call back within the hour. I waited an hour and a half only to get a call saying the doctor had already left. Terrible  service and uncaring staff</Text>

<Text>Please check with you insurance company on every items they put on estimate carefully. I caught them charge several hundreds on covered services. I had Delta Dental insurance called them in advance and let they know it is covered, but when I was in the office, they still said it is not covered, because their insurance staff are very inexperienced and could not find the covered item on provider's insurance book. I had to call the insurance company and hold for over an hour to do their job for them, and they try to give me a Starbucks gift card to write them a good review... no wonder they have good review on google.<//Text>< Pics>

Starting visit off wrong due to no handicap ramp for my grandmother!
Horrible service with Tyler.
Was not told to arrive an hour ahead of time to fill out paperwork...
Then to have them say paperwork took too long and that we would have to come back. They took us back 10 minutes later and the rest of the staff was nice.</Review>

Great place very friendly staff.  Great vibe overall. Isabelle in front was quick to check me in and Elyse greeted me with a smile and made me feel welcomed. Dr Monica was very pleasant and a damn good dentist. I would highly recommend this place.< /review>

This is the best experience I ever had with dental office. Elyse was very professional and friendly. Dr. Monica and Yervand explained really good about everything that needs to be done. This office should be #1.  Highly recommend to everyone.</Text>

This was my first visit and it was a great experience. My Dental assistant, Eylse was friendly, professional and caring. My doctor, Dr. Monica, was funny, knowledgeable, and very helpful with her advice. All and all I was very impressed and would go there again.<//Review>

<Review>Moe was very kind when taking my dental x-rays as well as the other service he provided. (Hope that got you points lol). My doctors were very kind as well. They asked about my schooling and was very enthusiastic which is helpful if you hate going to the dentist like myself. Next time I have to go I know the treatment will be done with care and excitement.</Review>< name>

Best experience I've had at a Dental Office. Staff was amazing and very friendly. Front office explianed everything in detail of what I needed to have done and very accommodating. Dr Mona is the best and very friendly. Will be recommending to friends and family.</text>

I love this place. The staff here is amazing! All the ladies here are professional and hard working and genuinely care about their job. For someone who has Medi-cal, it can be hit or miss with Healthcare in California, but this place stands by their values. I wouldn’t go anywhere else! Thank you Smile Time Dental!!!!!< /Text>

Best dental place ever. The staff and Dr. are so welcoming and outstanding. In less than a month in a half I was able to get everything I needed than being in a dentist where I was seen every 7 months. Definitely recommend this dental office<//Review>

<text>Just finished my first deep cleaning with Tay H. , absolutely blown away how pain free the whole experience was. I was expecting a horrid, white-knuckle experience but not at all!  Tay is an exceptionally light-handed hygienist; although I had a lot of scrapping done, her touch was so gentle that I found myself relaxing more and more as the procedure continued! Amazing! Grateful! No fears whatsoever about returning for the second-half of the cleaning! So glad I found a place this place; I will definitely be keeping up on my teeth cleaning schedule! Kudos; Tay, you were AWESOME! 😎< /text>< Pics>

STAY AWAY from this company. Mostly fake reviews go on YELP for real reviews most of these aren't even verified!!! They mislead you on telling you that services are covered by your insurance to make the most money out of you and invoice you after your insurance denies the claim. It not only happened to me but a lot of people read their Yelp reviews Not only that they try to up sell you on the products you don't need.</Text>

<Text>My experience with Smile Time Dental was 5 star the best thus far. Inna ✔ me in and was very clear about what I was being seen for.  Not even 5 min of waiting I'm already heading to thw back with elyse who was a DOLL. Ahw was also very clear on everything she was doing for me. Soon after when I was all finished and done Yesenia helped set my appt up with what ever time was suitable for mw. The staff here are very welcoming, clear and Respectful About anything that is gping to be done at your visit. Highly would recommend to ANYONE! ALSO A BIG THANKS TO DR. Mona and the gentlemen doctor as well. Very much appreciated!< /Text><user_id>113197607494252596737< /user_id><gmapID>0x809adfb30929d927:0xe8ae07017c01487f< /gmapID><Date>1555112071000<//Date>< Name>

<Review>This is the same concept as Subway & Chipotle. They prepare fresh pizza in front of you. You can choose your own toppings. The line can gets long since every customer is customized their own pizza and take more than a few minutes to make up their minds.

The Service:2 staffs behind the counter. When the line gets long, they might consider to add one more staff to speed up the service.

The Food:

Pizza - With their special oven, the pizza is done in a very short time. The thickness of the dough is perfect. All the toppings are fresh ingredient. Love the crust... crunchy. Fresh made pizza, can't get any better!!

Greek Salad - Large size for $8, huge portion, perfect to share. Fresh ingredient. Perfect amount of dressing.

The Parking: Parking structure on Fairoaks or street metered parking (challenge to find a spot)</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
I really hate writing bad reviews, but I couldn't let this issue go. I've been in working in customer service related jobs most of my life, and I've learn that you want you customers to be completely satisfied with whatever your company is selling.  I purchased a pizza from the Pasadena located that was nasty and brunt. I noticed it tasted bad in the car when i was far away from the restaurant, so I emailed the 800degrees pizza about the situations. The manager of the Pasadena location responded to my email and said that he would send me a gift card for me to get another pizza. His responds was about two months ago. I still have yet to get another pizza.  This place don't know how to treat it's customers. I wouldn't recommend this place.<//Review>

<Review>Don't get me wrong, I love 800 and will eat their pizza anytime so there's no doubt that the food is good here, it's just everything else that seems to go wrong at this location. It seems a bit mismanaged. The last couple of times we've gone there has been no one in line and it will take them an extra 5 minutes to get us going and then we won't see our food for 20 minutes. Last time they ran out of plates (and the place wasn't very busy) so we had to eat at the table in to go boxes, and the time before that they ran out of glasses for beer that we wanted (so we had to drink them in warm glasses or the water cups). I'm not sure if they're understaffed or what, but this location needs to figure out these issues that seem to be consistent, as it makes me not want to eat at this location - and it's frustrating knowing what a flawless experience the Westwood location is.< /Review></record>

Ordered spinach artichoke red onion and mushroom pizza on margherita base. Pizza is assembled and made to order via assembly line. Only complaint was there was a big take out order in front of us and only one pizza oven was on so it took almost 45 minutes to get our order. Finally the other pizza oven was fired up.< /text>

I was expecting a more flavorful pizza but alas it was bland even with added seasoning. For the price I paid for 5 toppings, I expected more to be honest. I like the soda machine and that is about it. Maybe things change and I just got a bad day when they were not making it with love.< /review>

Is there any discount for an Italian ?
I had a Dinner at 800 Degrees in Pasadena on Saturday Night and was Fantastic !!
It is a simple place where you can find easly new friends, and you can see how they prepared the Pizza because the Kitchen is directly in front of you when you order it.
The training and standard are Italian and they have also the bier "Peroni", famous Italian bier.
At the end of my order, I asked for a discount as Italian and you cannot belive it ! They where so nice and glad that charged me only the bier.
Simple things sometime are the best marketing strategy of ever.<//Review>

<review>The pizza is pretty good, but they could use a more knowledgeable staff. Asked for a Margherita neapolitan and the pizza dude was shocked to hear we only wanted "tomato, mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, olive oil, basil" and sort of tried to push more ingredients on us. That's pretty dumb. Otherwise, great crust, nice hot oven, and pretty good pizza. Was a bit on the saucy side too, but it was just a late night pizza. I grubbed.<//review>< user_name>

I was hoping for a better experience. We had a party of thirty and phoned in a couple days advance to warn them we were coming in today. We asked if we should pre-pre-order pizzas and they said no. They insisted that just standing in line was fast enough. The pizzas only take 90 seconds to cook, right? Wrong. Many of our party stood in line for over 20 minutes before ordering, to then wait 20-30 minutes for a pizza. It was silly how slow it was. We told them what time our party was coming and they still had only half the oven fired up. 3 pizzas at a time was never going to be enough, and they should have known that. They brag about being so fast but it was just a drag. Even after our party was done ordering there was a line, and people waiting 20 minutes for their pizza. Which are only supposed to take 90 seconds to bake. The extra toppings were minimal. I could hardly tell there was spinach. The "Neopolitan" style pizza was not just "soft and chewy" as they claim, it honestly seemed undercooked. The center of the pizza was so soft that when cut it would just fold over and drop the topping on the plate. All the oil on the pizza pro ably didn't help. I had to use napkin after napkin to wipe the oil from my lips. Needless to say, I'm not going to be giving 800 another visit anytime soon. Probably never. I could have probably been seated at the Cheesecake factory across the street and had a pizza served before 800.< /review>

To normalize this review, I will compare with Pieology and Blaze pizza companies, also here in Pasadena. 800 degrees is the slowest of the three, with a positively leisurely pace of pie building, payment, and slicing. This does seem to blend with the decor and atmosphere of the place, heads and shoulders above the deafening roar of fast-food like Blaze or the blinding white, cafeteria space of Pieology. 800 degrees is luxurious, elegant, and romantic. The downstairs secret tables are by far the best environment, actually quiet and secluded. 800 degrees has moved away from the buffet-like price model of all-the-toppings-you-desire for a fixed cost, with each topping adding a little ($1) or a lot ($3) to the price of the pie. However, this has permitted them to also offer extraordinary choices such as fine Italian meats, shrimp, and the like. The flavors are at least as good as Pieology and superior to Blaze, similarly with their chewy, softer crust that leaves the soggy/cracker like Blaze behind. Their dough is wonderfully yeasty, slightly superior to Pieology. All in all, a nice change of pace from Pieology and arguably superior pizza, but for ~30% more money at least. Pieology will remain our go-to delicious pizza hangout, Blaze in a pinch for reliable edible goodness, and 800 degrees for the date-like experience they are clearly targeting. Not great for families with small kids due to the fancier atmosphere.<//text>

<Text>I came here for their Social Media night where they gave free pizza/salad/drink for liking their social media pages.

For something that had lines and lines of people, they were pretty well organized. The staff were pretty efficient when it came to their pizza line and I got my food fast.

FOOD:
* Tarfuno Pizza - truffle cheese, garlic, onion and arugula
Delicious. The Truffle was what made it delicious. Their pizzas are pretty big, so I could had shared with someone else... but if you're hungry, this is enough.

Caesar Salad - standard

* Drinks - their drinks machine is AMAZING. You could get any drink you want. Just select on the screen and push. TECHNOLOGY is amazing.

AMBIANCE:
They didn't change much of what Louise use to be. But they are showing off the Pasadena Mural that is gorgeous and the chandeliers are a nice touch. The place is a cool hang out and just very POSH.

SERVICE:
Fast... a guy called me ma'am and I called him out on it. I was about his age! Geez! But I get it... they do that to customers. But still... ma'am. Service was nice tho! They got my food and done.

PRICE:[I didn't pay for it but I gauged the price]
A little pricey for the food. Salad is about $4... which I probably wouldn't had gotten if I had to pay for it.
The Pizza varies in price. It is kinda pricier than the other pizza joints, but they have a larger variety. Blaze and Pieology doesn't have truffle or prosciutto. They do. I love truffle. MMMM... Truffle.

OVERALL:
Nice place.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

So I went to this subway for the first time wasn’t very impressed. I wanted a meatball sub the meatballs we’re sitting out on the counter when I asked how long they responded back rudely saying you can order another sandwich I asked for broccoli soup and they had to microwave it and the meatballs were cold as well having to be toasted so they could be warm. Very rude and I feel like they are not following rules on storing and temping food. Won’t be going back and might forward to the health department< /text>

This was not a place to go.  The person making my sub seemed not to know how to prepare it.  She didn't understand me and the sub was very dry because she put the mayo on the meat and not the bread.   I just did not care for it.  Not going there again<//review>

Nice service, but proportions for veggies are skimpy. I expect the meat to be less than other places, but not the veggies.</Review>

This is the only Subway in the area I have ever enjoyed. The bread is never stale and the veggies area always fresh and crisp.<//text>

I tried to go here today for lunch. Parked in front of the store and as I was getting out of my car, the manager ran out and said she was having my car towed. I asked her why, and she said "customer parking only!" I tried telling her I was there for lunch and she told me "You need to buy your sandwich and leave or I am towing your car. Other customers are mad because they can't park here."

As much as I wanted a tuna sandwich, with a welcome like that, I decided to leave and eat elsewhere<//review>

<review>Rick is very nice, helpful, and a great sense of humor. Bill to quarter machine, and pay for dryer. I love this place, lots of washers and dryers, they also have large washers and double load dryers which is a plus. There is a great bakery next door also, home made bread, cakes, donuts, cookies, and coffee!<//review><Name>Clara Bolster</Name><pics>None</pics><GmapID>0x54d3ffed06abf391:0x70cac0c823b530b3<//GmapID>< time>

<Review>They took my clothes out of the dryers. Made excuses and acted like this was their normal set of social standards.  First of all, there is a pandemic.  Don't touch other people's stuff.  Gross.  Don't know where your nasty hands have been.  Secondly, you don't touch people's stuff in general especially at a laundromat.  Where I come from,  that'll get you in very real trouble.  Never going back here again. You can't just do your laundry here and mind your own business without the attendants making it weird for you.
Or anyone else for that matter.
This one of three laundromats I am now avoiding. Bye! Y'all are weird.< /Review>< Pics>

If you're going to charge me top dollar for washing, drying and folding my laundry you can at least make sure that you do it how I asked to have it done. That was my first review. Now they have a person working there that knows what she is doing. So, I have started to go back and try it again, so far so good.

I also leave pretty good tips but those prices I don't want to leave a big tip. So I really hope that you're paying your employees top dollar for their services to your company.

To be sure I work with a really large company here in town and we have an influx of contractors and I can let them know to try it out and tell me we're hat they think.< /Text>

We did our laundry here during our time living in Eureka. The laundromat always seemed clean. There is an attendant on site which is nice. Seemed a little pricey compared to others I've been to in other locations. Prices very based on the machines. But no problems. Good hours, too.</Review>

Ricky runs a good place.  The machines are in good working order.  He has plenty of change.  Typical priced Laundromat.  I recommend their wash and fold service.  It's worth it.  Ask for Natalie, she does an excellent job and don't forget to tip her for the good work.  I would go mid day for less people and more open machines.<//Review>

<review>No hot water for hot wash. Change machine did not work. The place is freezing. I guess they are skimping on costs by not heating the place for customers nor providing hot water. Attendant acted like she could give a rat's *@#. Skip this business and go elsewhere.</review>< Response>

My husband went to go do laundry here and the attendant came up to him and told him he didn't know how to use the machine. Instead of telling him how to use it, he took his finger and pushed him on the chest getting mad at him. Machines are always broke here. It's always dirty inside and bums always hang outside the building. Go else where!< /text>

Overlook its untidiness and if you have the time really look into the aisles, they will have what you're looking for and then some.  I've gone here a couple times for  some craft materials for my class and found many more things that I'm glad I didn't have to make on my own (their felt collection is impressive for a dollar store). Also the owner is a super chill guy.< /Review>

It's a pretty cool place. Its nice to come in and browse. I come here for their snack selection, which is pretty nice. There's two places dedicated to snacks: front counter and an aisle.<//text>

Dollarama is like Fry's.. They have literally everything. This is where I but my beautiful eyelashes, my toilet paper and anything I need for school projects! They even have receipt books. And much much more. You gotta go here if you have not.<//Text>

There is a lot of stock and very full shelves however it certainly isn't a 99 cents store like it's pretending to be. They have a small amount of fairly cheap items, but most is priced the same as Walmart or kmart< /review>

Not too sure, which owner these people are referring to. Its a family owned store. With all kind of goodies. From birthday parties to a variety of baby shower supplies. They have some high-end products (products you can purchase at Target/Wallmart/Michaels), as well of low-end (things you can find at the 99c store/Dollar tree). This is my go to store in San Fernando Valley. and both owners i have met (brother and sister) are both very kind people. I really hope this store stays open! :)<//review>

This is the BEST one stop discount (mostly .99) shop for ALL things CRAFTY (canvas, paint, beads, ribbon, stickers, cardstock and more), holiday decos, trinkets n things for party favors and  ton of toddler entertainment - I've also scored on decent and cheap car floor mats, Hello Kitty swag and awesome DIY nail stuff<//Review>

I recently visited this location and was shocked at the service. I purchased a table mat and realized it was defective when I got home. I assumed the owner would exchange it for another one,  instead the owner of the store accused me of bringing in an old mat. I have never been so disrepected in my life. I can not recomend this place to anyone. if you are looking for a good dollar store look somewhere else.< /review>

<review>Nice casual American restaurant with views of the water and Oakland bridge. The food is good - I ordered the Pot Roast and Caesar Salad. The pot roast was really rich, yet nicely balanced with the veggies and potatoes. The service was polite and fast. I recommend stopping here.<//review>< user>

<time>1619567505720</time><rating>5< /rating><review>An institution and the original Perry’s  - on Union Street for 45+ years. Fantastic, accommodating service and dependably delicious food and cocktails. Perry’s caters to a devoted, local San Francisco crowd. They’re currently only offering outside dinning, but their parklet is lovely, south facing and sunny. Get the burger or sliders - they’re spectacular. The cobb salad, fries, prime steaks, and Irish coffee are all also excellent. The Monday/Thursday half price bottle of wine night is a fan favorite.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnORMCA0zkJgFgp801jGme3HO8O15NQXZraZT4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ4xlc6vdcAQy4vqogorJH79smJ_zM5lTi9l23=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

< review>
I went there as a delivery driver, a woman from the staff (she looked like the manager) didn’t even look in my face and when I asked her any questions she just pretended she didn’t here me. After that another two guys talked to me and gave me the order and they were really nice but it was a really stressful situation.

My husband and I are new to both the neighborhood and city. We discovered Perry’s one day on a bike ride and have been ordering dinner once or twice a week since. Great food, reasonable prices, and friendly staff.< /review>

A Google search for hours on New Year's Day said they opened at Noon.  I was parked in front to order takeout to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Lights were off, restaurant closed and when I called, there was no answer.  I am trying support local restaurants during the pandemic, but it would be super helpful if Perry's management would update their Google page, and their voice mail recording to keep patrons informed on modified hours.<//Review>

I visited during the Covid, so I was not able to dine in but the staffs were very patient and cordial during the tough time. It is right on Union street which is the cleanest and posh part of town. I will definitely go back to try different items on menu.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Wayfarer is a fabulous place for a power lunch- this bistro    has an incredible hamburger! We also tried the fried chicken which was different but yummy. Service is spot on. It's very lively with an old school yet sophisticated vibe. Really solid!< /Review>< Pictures>

Randomly stumbled into this hole in the wall place. This place is super cute! It's a chill place to hang out with your friends or coworkers. They have a variety of games to pick from, even board games! I believe you just have to leave your id with them at the bar to rent a game? Not too sure. But they have pool, darts, ping pong, and shuffle board that go by an hourly rate. There is also a stage, so I guess sometimes there is a live band?< /Text>

<review>Great vibe and atmosphere, friendly and attentive wait staff..

We a nice beet, arugula and goat cheese salad... But the chorizo scramble was bland and lacked flavour and flair... Not so many vegetarian​ options..
But, I have to say the place was full and buzzing..<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcfpB23HFE8MaZTGVeg28pjDatU0HZvKVvN8zg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808580db38f97fcb:0x49236a7a921aa894</gmap_id></record>

Attentive, but not rushed, service for a sunny break in this attractive sidewalk bar and restaurant. We enjoyed two Americanos and a portion of crispy, sweet potato fries before continuing with our walk around this interesting area of San Francisco. As shopping districts, Union Street and Fillmore Street beat Union Square in my book. OK, the coffee could have been a bit stronger, but so far, weak coffee seems to be de rigeur in SF.</text>

The food was really good, especially the ribs. Not the cheapest, but enough for two people to share and be satisfied. Would have preferred the side veggies to be more than a few peices of asparagus.
Atmosphere was great, not too loud but enough of a buzz. I can imagine a "game night" being am awesome atmosphere in there.</Review>

Came here for brunch and really enjoyed the experience. They have a great bar area as you walk in and the food is quite great. They have a great selection of sandwiches and they had a pretty good bloody mary as well. The place was lively and a great place for brunch. You may want to consider reservations if you want to get a table. Definitely worth checking this place out.< /review>

<rating>3< /rating><text>Came in for Sunday Brunch. First of all, I cannot overstate that the service was great. But the food was lackluster at best. Bland, unimaginitive and unadventurous, it seemed that the menu was designed to suit people who are looking for a very predictable (boring) culinary experience. They do not offer bottomless mimosas. Which is okay, because the mimosas they do have are only $8 per Glass. Coffee was decent. Ambiance was comfortable and felt pretty nice (if you ignore the television playing infomercials). Overall, I would not return and would not recommend this establishment for their food.< /text>< Pictures>

Food is always decent but service was AWFUL
went for lunch...our food came out in  dribs and drabs.My soup arrived  at least 45  minutes before  the 3 other diners at my table. Our server kept reassuring us it was on the way! We asked for the manager who did not show up.. A VERY disappointing experience ..we are locals and wlll not return<//review>

We found Perry's through s Google Map search. We came in the middle of the day. Mostly locals at the bar. We were confused when we 1st went in. There was a hostess station but nobody ever greeted us. We went into the bar and was told to sit anywhere. We had to get our own menus and it took a long time for a waitress to come to us. However.. after that it was awesome. Really good food. Good portions and decent prices.
The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the issues I stated before we were seen.<//text>

<review>Love Perry's! It's an SF institution! The rib plate is such a huge portion it's enough to choke a donkey! Their day of the week regular specials are great, but then their daily specials make it a hard choice to go with what you know ir try what sounds like a great dish. I've done both and haven't been disappointed! Also their location on the embarcadero is great if you work or are downtown. Saeed (sp?) who is at the embarcadero location is amazing and have gotten to know him.  He always has a smile and more importantly remembers my drink order!<//review>< pics>

The service was not very good, felt like we were imposing on the staff, and the coffee and warm food was mediocre. The one bright spot was the almond croissant and butter croissant. Both were good. I'd only return to get a croissant to go.. unfortunately I'd want a coffee with it, and don't see myself coming back for that.<//Text>

One of the nicest quiche/tart places I ever been to. They have such a big variety and different flavors. Unbelievable prices for a nice cafe like that. Inspiring atmosphere, right next to the park. You can grab to go, sit at the park and enjoy the sun. Highly recommend!<//text>

Come join the locals and hangout.  I don't tend to change reviews, but then again how often do people actually listen?  They do here.  There always seems to be something going on especially when there is a game.  And they have you covered with tv's, but the real sleeper there is that they do a fantastic steamed lobster.< /Text>

Classic American dishes for dinner and a great bar with friendly staff. Local favorite for sure. People say they see Matthew Miller here all the time. Love the Caesar Salad with Salmon. They also have great wings, nightly dinner specials, and a solid brunch menu. It just feels like home.<//Review>

Even the Perry's at SFO airport is consistently good. This Union Street location is the original one and hasn't changed a bit since it opened probably forty years ago.

A big comfort food destination with a nice eat at the bar vibe. I like the fish and chips which is offered as a special on certain days. The portions of fish are skimpy and the fries are so-so. That kind of sums up the food here / folks keep coming despite the only OK fare. I would give another star for a true happy hour ($4 beer and well drinks; 4-7 pm) and even more for 2-3 sub $10 choices like the club sandwich and cheeseburger.<//Review>

An institution of San Francisco for almost 50 years now, Perry's is exactly what you want when you want to feel welcomed, be fed and have some excellent drinks. 1/2 price bottles of wine one Mondays and Thursdays is a nice perk too!< /text>

Great food, nice atmosphere, but their coffee sucks.

Had the onion soup which was tasty, the open face salmon sandwich was incredible, with an unbelievably thick piece of good quality smoked salmon, and the lemon tart was good too. The cappuccino, however, was terrible. It was over-roasted, with too much char in it, it was served near boiling point (it's supposed to be served at 160F), and the milk wasn't properly frosted.

I would certainly come back, but skip the cappuccino  next time.<//Text>

Outside seating with heaters that is dog friendly. Half priced bottles of wine on Monday and Wednesday night at this location. Friendly staff that is attentive. You must ask for water for it to be served. Try the tomato bisque soup on cold and foggy San Francisco days. It's great with the complimentary bread sticks. The southwest chicken salad or the beet salad with the fried cheese are popular go-tos and big enough to feed two. Bar seating inside has TVs playing local sports games.</text>

< review>
Stopped in at Perry's for a meal based on the reviews and rating. The bar atmosphere was pleasant.  Loud but that is expected.  3 of the 4 meals were good. Don't recommend the penne pasta as it was oily and flavorless. The real problem was when I paid for my half of the meals with cash.  Placing a $50 & $20 in the folder for the $47 bill and expecting small change to sort out a tip, I was told that I only paid $40 instead. I tried to insist that I gave a $50 (which I remember needing to separate from the other new 50s) with a $20.  The waiter insisted no and with no way to verify this I was left with no option but to pay extra.   Use credit cards when you dine there folks.  it is easier to monitor so you don' t get ripped off.<//review>

I have always liked this place.  The bakery is as good as it ever was.  the Apple Tart and the Macaroons are a personal favorite.  But the lunch food seems to have gone down hill a bit.  Maybe the acquisition by McDonald's has created some changes, not for the better.  Still, I do like the atmosphere.</text>

<rate>3<//rate><review>2.8/5. The location is good, at Union Street. The atmosphere is great at this place, especially if you sit outside and just watch the people walk around. The service wasn't as good as I'd hoped. The brunch menu is OK, but a little more variety would make it better. Prices are average. The portions are big. Food is good, I especially loved their jam, it's a must-try. I would recommend this place for breakfast (not brunch) if you're around that area.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808580db38f97fcb:0x49236a7a921aa894<//GmapID></record>

La Boulange is great for when you want a high-quality breakfast or lunch quickly.

Breakfast-wise, there are good vegetable tarts, croissants, macaroons, and other pastries that are well worth trying.

Lunch-wise, there are good salads (goat cheese is my go-to) that are relatively low-calorie; they also have decent sandwiches with a sort of french twist.

They have a good atmosphere that is pretty open air and lots of outside tables if you want to people watch.<//review>

<review>Perry's is just great anytime day or night for anything. From their brunch selection to their happy hour appetizers to their half off bottles of wine nights you really can't go wrong. I love their wings and the large mugs they serve lattes in. Staff is always friendly and sitting outside during a nice day for people watching is a definite plus.<//review>< gmap_id>

Good food, good service, but it was really loud - mostly because we were seated next to two tables of guys with no volume control at all. Other rooms appeared to be more sedate.< /text>

Bland food.
An uninspired menu.
Grumpy, absent, unattentive waitstaff.
Host was on his phone the whole time instead of helping out in the dining room.
And...
My order was wrong.

It is so sad, Perry's is one of those SF institutions that you want to love, but this place is in serious need of a reboot.
Choose a different brunch place, there are plenty nearby.< /Text>< pics>

The best part about this place is the outdoor seating, though it's tough to get a seat outside since they only have a few tables. But, if you do it's great people watching! I've had their brunch and lunch- the food is alright. I ordered a wedge salad that was pretty good but nothing to write home about.< /review>

So excited to have found this little piece of Heaven. We in the N.W. know this Bakery well, having a Starbucks on every corner.  Yummmmmy is the word for the club sandwiches and greens my Granddaughter and I had devoured.
We will make Tim's little piece of Heaven our favorite for all time.
Thanks Tim for your great hospitality and wonderful food.< /Review>

I just posted a bunch of photos to share my experience. I had been to another store a couple of years ago that was an actual working bakery. The smells, sights and sounds were more extreme verses this store but the quality didn't change. Certainly worth the effort to google the location and find a parking spot. A must visit location for everyone.</Text>

Worst service and worst oatmeal ever!

I ordered oatmeal so that I could get my breakfast quickly, since my plane was about to board. Meanwhile, two people were seated next to me. All three of us put our orders in at essentially the same time. I waited, and waited, and waited. Both of the people seated adjacent to me were served in a reasonable period of time: one had ordered eggs, bacon, toast, etc. and the other ordered granola. Meanwhile, no food for me; no server came by to check either. When I inquired about my food a server brought my (now) cold oatmeal to the table, so cold that it had developed a crust on the top.

There was no apologies from the wait staff, no offer of compensation, nothing except a bill.

My recommendation to y'all, stay away from Perry's at SRF Terminal 1 with a 10-ft pole!!!  It's the worst on all accounts!< /text>

First, they removed the olives then came Nutella but they really hit the button by taking away the butter! Yes, they sell croissants, baguettes and yet, they thought it will be a smart move to cut costs in butter.</review>< date>

<text>Love going to La Boulange for coffee and fresh baked loaves of bread! The loaves are super cheap at $3-$4 and with such a nice variety, it's a great place to get some special carbs. I love their huge latte bowls as well, which are perfect for brunching and relaxing. The food is pretty fantastic as well.</text>< pics>

We ended up here on Thanskgiving night after looking for someplace to eat for a while. It was a lively place, and rather crowded. We waited about 15 minutes, no big deal. When we were seated, it was way in the back, wedged into a corner of the room. When we ordered, and the food arrived, the waiter couldnt get through to put the dishes down. He had to hand them all to me. A bit wierd, but it was crowded and not a typocal night I guess. Still, it was wierd. The food was solid, but otherwise unremarkable. The kids enjoyed theirs, and we had a good time.</review>

< review>
One of the waiter is racialism. He asked my friend (white people) "Does everything ok?" for two times. Also my friend took long time to take his order, the waiter was very patient also trying to talk some jokes. However, he never come and ask me (Asian)"Does everything ok?". When ever I needed something, I was trying to ask him, but he never listens to me. When he finally came to me, he was very impatient.  I also fell down in the restroom because of the water on the floor. Such a nice restaurant should keep their restroom clean and dry.

That waiter is disgusting.

The food was really good, and other waiter is very nice to me.< /review>

Many of us in Lafayette really loved La Boulange, and would love you to come back. That lovely location still seems to be vacant, and we have nothing equivalent. Please!<//review>

I have lived in the marina for the past 15 years and by far this is the worst bar on union. The bartenders specially Dave is extremely rude. They physically threaten customers. I had not even order a drink and the bartender threatened to physically harm me. This place employees the worst trash of the Bay. If you want to get insulted and disrespected while you drink go to This place.</review>

Old San Francisco faire.  The food is excellent bar food and the staff has been there forever.  Love Perry's but not for the food.  Going there is a San Francisco bar and a lot of fun.</Text>

Perry's is a chain-style restaurant however it still has a very San Francisco feel.  The restaurant is definitely bigger than it appear with a large back area and a small enclosed patio.  The food here is ok, fairly standard cuisine but they do make a good burger.  They also have a full bar and make decent cocktails.  I have been here for sporting events as well and they do a good job and have plenty of TV's.< /Text>

<Review>Let's be honest - this is cafeteria food at triple the price. The Fish and Chips were pretty awful (clearly the battered fish piece came frozen from a food distributor). The veggie burger seemed liked a better choice. The Vodka cocktail I had tasted like pure lime juice and cost $10. Very overpriced for mediocre food.< /Review><response>None</response>< username>

< Review>
I was told today that is not possible for my roast beef mini sandwich to have a little too much horseradish. I have been a loyal customer for a long time. This is the 4th time I have ordered this sandwich. But as far as the guy with the bierd goes I was wrong because he checks the sandwiched. Wow, very impresive. He turned around and walked away. For the first time ever I threw away food from La Boulangerie and went to Starbucks:(
Very easy way to manage a very simple situation. He even told me that by definition horseradish is spicy. Seriously?!
He can use some customer skills lessons.</Review>

Went here for a business dinner with some colleagues and was pleasantly surprised. This place is very cute and perfect for groups.

While waiting, we ordered the quesadilla, wings and a bottle of wine (1/2 off on Mondays). Both appetizers were delicious! The dry breadsticks were nice to have, but I'd rather waste my calories on actual breadsticks.

I am unsure of what everybody ordered, but I believe there were:
Cobb Salad - all 3 women thoroughly enjoyed this
Pot Roast - tender, flavorful and very filling
Perry's Hamburger - very generous serving of meat, cooked perfectly
Sliders - looked delicious!

Overall, didn't hear any complaints about the food and atmosphere was great. Would definitely return for dinner again!<//Text>

The "back to basics" replacement after La Boulange was disastrously sold to, and subsequently ruined by, Starbucks.

Honestly, it's mostly the same stuff. Lots of the same pastries, salads, sandwiches, and coffee offerings as before. The pastries are bomb, and I think most other things are tasty, but nothing outside of the pastries are mindblowing.

Local tip: get your coffee or chai in a bowl - nothing makes drinking a chai more fun than a humongous bowl to sip it out of, especially on a chilly day.</Text>

<text>If you are looking for a delicious french breakfast with egg options or bakery items this is the place to go! Very neat casual spot . I was very pleasantly surprised when i saw that they had the traditional buche de noel " christmas log" for christmas!  I ordered the egg white with cheese sandwich and greens on side. Great fresh bread and salad! The cortado coffee was great too. I would definitely go back several times a week to eat there.<//text><time>1483027450091</time></record>

I happened to be driving by as was happy to see they are still open. Ordered a coffee and an almond croissant, my usual, but it seemed different now. It's still good, but it used to taste lighter and fresher, like it was made that morning. Perhaps it's just me. But they don't have wifi!!! I could have sworn I used wifi here before. I don't know any coffee shops without wifi. C'mon guys, let's get this place updated...< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I ordered a grilled cheese and a veggie burger for my friend and I. His grilled cheese arrived and my burger had not. By the time he had finished his lunch mine was still not there. He went up to the counter to query and was just told that the burger had been made but did not know where it was. It was not till another worker overheard and said another one should be made. I was very disappointed in this service.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Simply great across the board. They serve your coffee in a bowl, which is a little puzzling to me, but it's good!</Text>

(Translated by Google) Exquisite food, good meat, undeniable quality. The ribs were delicious.

The attention was good, we were able to book in advance so we arrived and we had where to sit without waiting. All excellent.

Exquisita la comida, la carne en buen punto, la calidad innegable. Las costillas estaban deliciosas.

(Translated by Google) I loved this place. I do not give the 5 stars because I went with my husband to dinner on February 14 and the food was bad, I imagine that by the date although there were not so many people in the restaurant.

Me encantó este lugar. No le doy las 5 estrellas porque fui con mi esposo a cenar el 14 de Febrero y la comida estaba pésima, me imagino que por la fecha aunque no había tanta gente en el restaurante.</text>

(Translated by Google) La Boulange is a French bakery chain bought by Starbucks, notably to expand its sandwich offer. Personally I prefer La Boulange because it is bakeries as we would like to see in France: real living spaces, where we come to relax, work, have coffee and lunch ... And all the sandwiches with avocado and bacon are excellent!

(Original)
La Boulange est une chaîne de boulangeries française rachetée par Starbucks, notamment pour étoffer son offre en sandwichs. Personnellement je préfère La Boulange car c'est des boulangeries comme on aimerait en voir en France : de véritables espaces de vie, où l'on vient se détendre, travailler, prendre un café et déjeuner... Et tous les sandwichs avec de l'avocat et du bacon sont excellents !</Text>
