I went here for the rapid COVID testing. It was easy to schedule an appointment online and pay. Once I got there, check in was quick, and the test as well. I received my results in about 30 minutes. Very organized and quick!< /text>

No long lines or places with workers who literally say they don’t want to be there all night and when you look at them funny, he changed his story and said they don’t have enough tests! Don’t go to San Pedro Urgent Care!</review>

I went and it was really fast but I needed both email and text results for work and I never received my email results.  Who can I talk to for the email results? it’s really upsetting that I didn’t receive them through email, I emailed covid clinic and tried calling them and I have not received any responses and it’s really upsetting me.  please help me out with this.< /Review>

Fast and friendly, close to home, drive thru style where you don't get out of your car.  Sometimes the wait is 10 minutes, sometimes 2 hours because of how many people show up.  Just depends on how lucky you are that day.</text>

The results were faster than the wait time in the line.
I was in line from 7am to 7:57 , and got the results at 7:59.
I'm delighted I tested negative but for some reason I feel uneasy about paying 175$ for someone to pick my nose and go into a storage container and text me right away im negative.<//Text>

<Text>I made an appointment online after feeling sick. The website crashed after making my appointment but when I called the message said to go ahead and come in. I drove 30 minutes to get there and waited in line for 40 minutes before being told that I couldn’t come in without a confirmation number. I called the number again and the message said the same thing to go ahead and come in if you missed your appointment or if you need to be tested. The process and denial of being tested was beyond frustrating!<//Text></record>

On Saturday I stop by Veronica Insurance I was actually on my way to Sam’s Club And saw there was a Veronica insurance I decided to stop by for a price quote for my full coverage insurance once I step into the doors I was greeted by Delia and Griselda. I was also offered water, they both have great customer service made me feel comfortable. If I could give them a 10 star I would, you guys should definitely go with them. I got a super great deal only went for a price quote and I ended up getting my policy thank you Veronicas insurance and thank you for having a great team</Text>

I just want to thanks Delia Ortiz from veronicas insurance from South Gate for being really helpful, reliable, and trustful I was looking for an insurance for my new car and I was getting ridiculous prices from other insurance companies because of my age (20) I guess but Delia looked out for the best price for myself and my car. I would definitely recommend her to help anybody who’s looking for any type of insurance.
Thank you Delia you do a greaaaat job!!!< /review>

So Delia helped me today and thank God, I know I came to the right place because we go to the same church, VICTORY OUTREACH! She goes to the Compton location and I am from the Huntington Park one! So the whole team helped me today further my process in getting my license so I am super blessed, they got me a lower price after I asked them if they could, the office is well kept with ac and it’s in a prime location to go and eat or shop after!</text>

By far worst experience! They are only helpful when the client is making a payment. If you have an issue or concern they make excuses, and aren't capable/ show motivation to help. I will not be purchasing an automobile insurance policy with them ever again. (IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD)</Review>

I've been going from insurance companies to the next such as Geico and Esurance but their rates were too high so I decided give Veronica's a shot after seeing their ads everywhere. As I entered the office I was immediately greeted with a warm welcome by a kind beautiful lady named Viridiana. She gave me a quote that was a lot lower than the other places I've gone to so I decided to get it. Viridiana was very patient with all my questions and told me everything I needed to know. It was a pleasant experience and I would highly recommend Veronica's if you're paying too much for your insurance.< /Text>

This is a horrible insurance company no matter what city or state you open your policy. I have been ripped off for $560.00 to start a insurance policy plus the monthly fee come a new year I got new insurance for same trailer I paid $95.00 for the entire month. I kept my insurance for non owners and I have tried to change the cc on file and now my insurance is cancelled due to there lack of training and now expect me to pay for the cancellation fees. I have never had such poor service until I used Adrianna's. I am just going to pay another insurance company....1 last thing can you people hire people that speak proper English not everyone here is the United States speaks Spanish.</Text>

<review>so my premium is $32 a month, i opened the policy on december of 2014 and its about to expire next month, tell me why my payment's jumped from 32 to 54$ , so i went to this adrianas branch, no matter how much i told them to give me the reason why my premium went up they could not find any reason to give me, i never had an accident, no tickets, and no ther issues, so why? so before i get to what the brokers told me i want to state that i have got a paper from my insurance company saying my new 2016 payments will be 54$ and no need to re opened the policy since im already on it, so i went into the branch and asked if i can get a better quote they say yes of course and the lady pulls out a quote of 59$ a month and in my mind im like thats more then what ill be having to pay if i keep the policy, and i told them find something better and they said theres this other one its $43.95 a month but you need to pay $100 something to open that policy im like no i dont want to open a new one just get a better quote, so they she said she might get the fee waved off so they she says i just have to pay $69 and my payments are $43.95 so i told them that i will think about it and she gave me her card with the quote so just incase i changed my mind, i went in the other day , the other lady looked like she did not want to help me, so this other broker is helping me, she is getting info and she pulls out a suppose good estimate of $69 a month and i told her that the other lady gave me a quote of $43.95 a month and she says no sorry thats not here in our system.. man it was just hectic, im done with adrianas, i told them im okay and walked out... now ill make sure the company get's in on this.... by the way, i guess the lady in charged no help whats so ever she look like she dint even want to help me at all..< /review></record></dataset><record>

This store will order what you're looking for if it's not in their store stock. Not only am I paying for a system I wanted for a smaller monthly payment than ANYWHERE else, but I got the pro system for this amazing price. I really APPRECIATE THE PEOPLE & SERVICE THIS STORE PROVIDES.  It's not a corporate chain, so they're able and willing to work with ANYONE. You just have to communicate with them and make your payments. Try this store....YOU'LL LOVE THEM! PERSONABLE STAFF NOT FAKE!< /Text>

Staff is very helpful and willing to make the customer happy. They can get you just about anything you need to rent. Prices are very reasonable and payments are very low.</Text>

I have bought nearly everything in my house from here. They always work with us on making sure we find something within our budget. I love that we get the extra month to pay off items. The best part about going here is the family environment. There are always family friendly movies playing and my kids feel right at home. I always recommend them to family and friends.</Review>

That being the case we still offered you a full refund if you brought the item back, we also offered to split (our cost) of replacement covers. As we discussed if you review your receipt you will see you were not charged any delivery fee only the cost of the product you purchased. We have gone above and beyond for you but that was not enough, I hope you have a better buying experience elsewhere. Sorry we couldn't meet your expectations, at least as you stated you got a great price on a sofa you love.\n\nAdditional info to address your added concerns. The sofa was cleaned before it was floored, not after the sale. It was floored and offered in a clean as is condition which is the condition you received and purchased it in. At the time of your purchase you were made fully aware that the sofa was previously owned and was being discounted for that reason. We are still happy to refund you the full purchase price to resolve this issue as we have offered from the beginning.\n\nRegarding delivery, you asked for a further discount, I stated sure I will sale it to you for that price, but I will have to charge to deliver the item. I told you that in order to deliver the item for free the price we agreed upon really was the lowest price I could offer."}< /resp>

<review>Company sucks..bought a couch and it had ciggatte burns on it and now owner wants me to pay half to get it fix ..i bought couch as is ..so shame on me for not checking correctly.but who ever cleaned or vacumm couch before delivering it to me should of been said or opened .and it never was..dont go to them ..owner also lied and said he didnt charge me a deliver fee when he did.50 dollars now he isback tracking his words..beware of rent to own ..do not buy or rent from there..first of all dude.you did charge me deliver fee,cause when i first went in asking about couch u asked me if i had truck or for delivery and i said delivery and you said extra 50 for delivery and as far as recipt u can write or type what ever you want to make it seem like you didnt charge for delivery.And who ever cleaned couch before bringing it to my apartment should called me and said hey David i know u seen and dont know if you seen the ciggatte burns but thought we should mention it to u.that would of been the right thing to do.but u were so worried about making a quick buck thats it.And as far as going half with u on anything thats out of the question..because i was going to furnish my whole housenext month with your stuff but after this no way...u lost a customer that was going to spend thousands of dollars there .cause u were so chip on doing the right thing..and i will tell people about this experience and not to go there ...it may not hurt your feelings or pocket .but it will give second thoughts on going there...and remember i didn'tpay for couch until it was delivered ....so again someone should of said something about burns.cause i know i made a big mistake on my part by not checking couch all the way.it is a learning experience and i will be telling some of my friends to close there accounts there .and they also will pass the word on...< /review></record>

My husband and I have been doing business with Rent To Own for several years. We have always been treated very well, unlike other places we used in the past. As a customer, it's our place to keep current with our promise to pay. When there was a problem with anything or we just needed to return an item, everything went well. If I could afford it, I would purchase more. Thanks to the owners and all the staff we very much appreciate them working with us.          Thank you, Clay & Barbara Cook<//Review>

This review is in response to the review by Jasen Anstess, a month ago. My name is Clinton and I'm the general manager of Rent to Own in Visalia. I have searched and haven't found your name in our system but I apologize for any service issues you had with us. We pride ourselves on serving our customers with respect and fairness. I would like to ask for a chance to make up for any short-comings you may have experienced in your previous business with us. Please call and ask for me when you have time and we can get you into anything you're in need of rent-free for a month. Thanks.</text>

<review>Ok so I resently bought a dryer here and the belt broke on it in two days. its only me in my household so it wasnt that much clothes. "Half loads" I tried informing them that it happened. They acted like it was my fault. Scam artist.  I will never shop there again..< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<review>Fantastic service. Made special appointment to call me before they opened so that could have service before the start of my work day. No issues using my own equipment. Setup and activation was easy over the phone.

After 2 months, not a single outage even during the rainy weeks. Consistently achieving 100Mbps as advertised with their Level 2 non-fiber plan.

Highly recommended.<//review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>They are not quite as advanced as other providers (must fax your application or submit in person) but the people there are great and efficient. A short 5-10 minute conversation was all that was needed to submit my info. They noticed I had my own modem and sent the info to their technician. They called back a few hours later the same day to confirm that my modem and plan would work fine, and luckily no technician even needed to visit my property. No up-selling plans or promos or anything

Glad to see San Bruno treating the internet as a utility!<//review>< pictures>

At Shelter Creek, we had no choice that San Bruno Cable dominated that whole apartment complex. We all had to share... So no matter which building y’all lived in, y’all shared your GB with the whole building, which was well over 300 people per building.

Our Internet was super super slow, our TV (FireStick) constantly buffer (never able to watch TV nor movie), and we still couldn’t use our phones on the WiFi... we had to go to the street to use our phone data for internet, to make a call, or to revive a call.

When we moved & went with AT&T, which was 1,000 % improvement.

Beware of dominating companies! Make sure to find other options...</review>

Initially signed up expecting to get basic service with no issues. However 10 days later, there’s still NO internet, technical support couldn't even trouble shoot the router properly. To make matters even worse the office is closed on weekends. Pointless Its Monday morning I can’t even get a representative on the phone. The support email doesn’t reply back either.  AVOID at all cost. If I could rate a zero I would.< /text>

<text>Very happy with my service from San Bruno city net services . After 16 years being under the gargantuan Comcast Xfinity stranglehold it’s great to be with a company and in a city that offers affordable fast internet . Setting it up was a breeze (for me to do by myself during this shelter in place ) and the kind customer service has been appreciated each time I’ve called.<//text>< Date>

It’s probably the worst internet provider. I pay for a 1 gig fiber, never get that speed. The customer care only cares about if you can connect and don’t care about the slow speeds. Internet goes off at random times and there’s nothing you can do about it. Just awful.< /Text>

This is the worst internet/cable company ever! I have to restart the WiFi at least twice a day. I bought the 100 mbps WiFi but when I ran a speed test it says that it runs at 50mbps. I called the after hours number and the employee said that there’s no guarantee that i will get what i paid for. I do not recommend this cable company to anyone. I wish I could give it 0/5 stars but the gentleman who set up my WiFi was really nice.</review>

Internet service review: Slow speeds, a horrible customer website, contacted idiotic support multiple times in 2018 and they can do nothing to solve the constant outages and slow internet speeds, because they are just an "answering service", when after hours. I have to use my phone provider as a hot spot multiple times just to get decent internet in my house.</review>

Have had San Bruno Cable ever since I moved here many many years ago. The few minor problems that occurred were taken care of fast and efficiently. I'll bet most San Bruno Cable customers love the service. Always seems like the unhappy souls write the negative reviews. The satisfied customers appreciate the good service but don't take the time to express.< /review>

At first when I moved to San Bruno I was happy not to be stuck with Comcast however now that I am several years in, I actually miss Comcast! The prices are high for the choices offered, from the start I paid more for less options. The number of outages are ridiculous and there way too many stations I don't watch. Then they bullied our complex to switch to a new wiring and if we don't switch, they are cutting us off. Getting a smart TV for Christmas and switching internet--bye bye cable TV and the ridiculous monopoly.< /Review>

I've been using SB Cable for years. I love that it's a local company and the in home service is pretty good. However, my Wi-Fi goes out several times a week and when it does, it's usually after hours. Good luck trying to get someone to help over the phone because the hold time is unbearable. Sadly, because of the unreliability I will be looking for a new company that can provide our in home service.</text>

< review>
We’ve never had a problem with them outside of some internet outages, but those are few and far between it seems now, one hasn’t occurred in a very long time and all outages were very short. Definitely go through their troubleshooting, they won’t always send someone out unless you do that first (or say you do). Every time we’ve called or gone in the person has seemed nice and helpful.

HBO Go is now included and so is TVEverywhere with the plan you have. For what our house needs it’s great, but speeds sometimes aren’t great if there’s many people doing heavy duty things on the WiFi, so definitely be aware of that. And they can sometimes only help as far as the modem. The remotes and cable box upgrades were definitely a plus from the old ones we had and they were great about having us replace them and made the process easy as can be.<//review>

<Review>Slow staff, I walked in and was the only person there. It took them 5 minutes to produce a single piece of paper to get my basic information and schedule a date for install. After completing, I waited another 5 minutes for them to take the completed form. I was very clearly complete as I wandered around their tiny front area, looking at brochures to waste the time. There is like 5 people all sitting in direct sight and none of them even acknowledged my presence. Customer service skills = 0 ..... if they weren't my only option I'd be with UVerse.

Only reason they get a 3rd star? Their install guy was pretty cool.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Terrible cable service. Limited channels, esp HD. Virtually non-existent On Demand. Internet download speeds for the "up to 75mb" plan vary greatly and usually average about 30mb. "24 hour" tech support can't do anything to resolve otherwise simple problems. It drives me insane I can't get Comcast in San Bruno, I'd GLADLY pay double for better service. Think twice before moving to San Bruno.<//text>

I've had to deal with this disgrace of a cable company for my entire life. So many channels are not in HD and this idiotic town of San Bruno has a monopoly over the cable industry. What a complete waste of San Bruno taxpayer money. We should all be ashamed for enabling such a pathetic excuse of a cable provider for staying alive for so long. We are all really to blame here.< /review>

Extremely  slow and spotty internet service enabled  and kept by a monopoly they have in San Bruno.  Sadly  cellular service is not the best in my area so using cellular data is mot always a viable option.<//text>

< Review>
I will admit, I've had a change of heart. (Read my previous review from a year ago). I was so upset with this provider, but after a while I noticed my internet starting working really well. My videos almost never buffer and I don't have those frustrating moments I used to. They're doing something, and it's working.

Keep it up
_

1 Star Review from Aug 2014:
The internet speed is slower than the dial up internet I had 15 years ago. This is ridiculous. It takes me 2.5 hours to watch a 30 min show.

I tried calling their technical support. It's no use.

And we have no other choice. My frustration is beyond anything I've ever experienced with any company. EVER.<//Review>

It's horrible. Sometimes there's a lag between my hdmi cord from my cable box to tv and the sound and picture become out of sync, the internet connection is the worst I ever had, and they don't have an NFL package. The only good thing about them is how cheap they are and the only reason I'm with them is because the only provider my apartment manager allows the tenants to use, is San Bruno cable. I hate it.< /Text>

<Text>Hi, I see very bad reviews for our SB Cable  and I was very hesitant to switch to SB Cable from at&t.  Finally today I let the SB Cable to come in to my house and its it terrific, super fast.  I ordered the 50mbps one and I am getting over 70mbps.  Only thing I dont like is the limit cap they have or how much we can use.  No other companies now a days have the limit.  Hope they will remove that soon.  I recommend "San Bruno Cable"  to all the residents here.  That way they can also improve and keep up the good work.  "Make San Bruno great again",  LOL lol LOL where is the smiley face

Suggestion to SB Cable administration or to the City of San Bruno:  Please  remove the usage limit,  no other internet companies do that.  Try the fiber optics, that's where all your competitors  are heading.  Try compeet with other companies, instead try to be a monopoly and force people to do something.  If you can give a good service people going to naturally use your service, more customers, -more business - more money,  right? You dont need  adds, people will spread the words.  Go San Bruno.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

I'm paying for 50 Mbps and the speed fluctuates between 3 and 50 during the day. What are the SLAs on this service - looks like none. Also, the internet keeps cutting out repeatedly during the day every few days and the bimbo on the other end of the like just says that she doesn't see anything on this end. Their tech support is outsourced and it sucks even more than Comcast's. Honestly this is the only drawback of living in San Bruno which is otherwise a great town. If you choose a location that's closer to a DSL central office (e.g. Sonic), try this alternative service. I live far away from the central office so SB Cable is the only option. It's twice as expensive as Comcast in other towns and the service absolutely sucks. :(</text>

If you enjoy TV and Internet do not move to San Bruno as you are stuck with SBC or a Dish

This has to be the worse cable company in the State and I have no choice but to use them or install a Dish. The Cable went out during Half Time of the NBA Championship last night along with Internet and I woke up this morning and it is still out. I call SBC and they say "you are in an outage area sir, no estimation of time to renew service" Not only is that bad, we cannot get HBO Go or any of the other cable on demand service on our computers because they choose not to offer it. HELP COMCAST! Can you believe something is worse than Comcast!

Please for once start giving us our monies worth. Slow internet no streaming options for cable channels which we all pay for and you choose not to make available. please allow Comcast to offer us service so we can have real cable and internet like the rest of the Bay Area.</review>

<review>I don't get it - why are we paying $42/month for a meagerly 16mbps down and Comcast's customers are getting higher and higher speeds. This is absurd - these guys don't even own the infrastructure - they are essentially the middle man.

Why or why San Bruno? Every other city around you has Comcast but no - you had to be special. How do we get rid of them and switch to Comcast - how...where do I need to sign????!!!<//review>< Pictures>

<rating>1< /rating><review>If you are deciding which cable service and internet service to sign up for do not choose san bruno cable services. From installation to changing packages nothing was done effectively. I had to take notes with a pen and paper as i would watch tv and notice errors freeze or glitches. it felt like i was working for them and i just wanted to watch tv. I highly suggest that you seek all other options i was told by them that the only cable service offered in san bruno was theres. That however, is not rue so dont take their word for it, do your research. I have had really bad service from other comapnies and i would gladly go back to them because at least what im being charged for worked if it didnt they were fast with adjusting and fixing the problem. I was told to pay a bill that is horribly incorrect and that they will review it and when done will make adjustments and credit it back to future bills. That to me sounds like a shakedown. rather crediting the account and making adjustments now they will do so later if they feel like it. THATS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Do not and I REPEAT DO NOT SIGN UP FOR SAN BRUNO CABLE AND TV. YOU WILL REGRET IT AND CREATE UNECESSARY WORK FOR YOURSELF. Companies should take more pride in customer service especially if they are in the service and sales industry.</review>< Date>

The Internet service and customer service over the phone is the worst. I've encountered many latency issues, random disconnects, and blackouts of service. Phone service keeps you on hold for over 10 minutes. I would love to see San Bruno get off municipal cable service and allow real TV and Internet providers into the city.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) This service is really the worst! I have problems with the internet! I was more than 45 min with an online Technician! And it was only wasted time! He could never fix the problem! And stay the same! Think about it before connecting! It is very difficult for you to solve a problem with them! I do not recommend them!

<resp>None< /resp><Date>1475117045395<//Date><text>My wife recently stopped in for an oil change, and an oil change alone. As expected, they pitched the "your three year old car needs everything that we offer replaced." Fortunately, she only took the $100 ($60 too much) oil change, $60 rear diff flush ($30 too much) and $30 (also too much) tire rotation. What does bother me is that they said that the engine air filter should be replaced (see attached photo if it shows up). I've pulled new filters out of the box that were almost as "dirty" as this filter. Avoid this place if you are looking for honest business. My wife's lack of automotive knowledge doesn't give you the right to take advantage of her. She ended up paying $215 on the way out the door... That's one hell of an oil change visit.</text><Name>Brandon West<//Name><GmapID>0x80ecf0e1441fecad:0xc7e30fe800ac2857<//GmapID>< user>

I had a great experience at Jiffy Lube. It started with my phone call to find out how much an oil change would cost. Lorena answered the phone and she was so pleasant and helpful. Of course I called another place inquiring about the cost for an oil change and they were actually like $5 cheaper but I was so impressed with how friendly and helpful Lorena was that I came here. They got me right in and did an excellent job. My entire experience was fantastic. I especially want to point out how courteous and helpful Lorena was. The way she treated me on the phone was the whole reason I came in. Give that girl a raise!!< /Text>

As I was paying, they informed me that my “check engine” light was on when I came in - which is simply not true. When I disagreed, they insisted. I asked why it was on, and they said it would cost me $120 to diagnose the problem. If my light had been on, which it was not, would they not have informed me of that before performing service? Is that not what any mechanic on planet earth would have done? I like the service, but do not appreciate being lied to, nor do I appreciate that they would not accept responsibility. Fortunately, the light reset after driving a few miles and restarting the car. No harm, no foul, but the lack of integrity put me off.</text>

<Review>One of the mechanics at the store lied to me about the condition of my vehicles brake fluid by showing me a litmus strip with the brake fluid on it and telling me it had high levels of copper in it in order to up sell me an almost $100 service to replace it. Brake fluid is a lifetime of the vehicle fluid that does not need replacing.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>
{'time': 1618413962234, 'text': 'Good morning Dylan. Our technicians test the brake fluid for excessive copper / moisture content. Brake fluid can become contaminated over any period of time and should be replaced if it is contaminated. If contamination is found it should be replaced. While some manufacturers have a regular schedule to change the fluid, others may not but that does not necessarily mean it is a life time fluid. Our sole purpose is to let you know the condition and if you wish to have it replaced we have that service available. If you choose not to do it with us, you should consider having it done elsewhere. If you have further questions or comments please reach out to me directly: ccjiffylube@gmail.com Sean Porcher, owner'}</response>

I am so grateful for the professional and trustworthy service Kyle and his team gave me.  Due to covid, I am laying over thousands of miles from home:  I needed tires and a new battery (along with my oil change) to get back home.  Kyle gave me an excellent recommendation and price for tires:  as a 61 year old woman traveling alone, I really have to rely on professionals to help ensure I get home safely.  With Kyle and his San Luis Obispo Jiffy Lube team, I was in good hands.  The tires have great handling and a quiet ride:  and importantly to me during covid, Kyle accommodated my request to have all this work done while I remained in my vehicle (to safeguard against exposure to surfaces inside my car.)  Thank you (!) so much for helping to ensure my safety and peace of mind.< /Review>

<text>Wow! These guys went above and beyond. They were fast, courteous, and thorough.

⚠️ WARNING: Do not buy the Groupon coupon for Juffy Lube! They were not paying Jiffy, so they no longer accept the Groupon Deals.

The Groupon coupon turned into a big FUBAR, but thankful they went above and beyond to make things right.

Facility was clean and I was happy to get my overdue oil change in a pandemic without getting out of my car. Price was about expected and brought in a coupon to bring it down about 10%. Worth it for the convenience and quick work. Everyone had face coverings and stayed as far apart as can be expected in a garage. Glad they are being safe.< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><response>None<//response><Review>I took my car in for an oil change and a Lube job. When I got the car back they told me that they could not do the lube job because it has seal components and they could not get to them to grease them. When I went to pay the bill of $125.70 I feel they should have not charged me that amount since they did not do the job that I originally went there for. Before they put the car on the rack I told them the fluid for my radiator was low and it needed fluid. Their paperwork shows radiator coolant level may require attention I thought they were supposed to add the fluid if anything was needed along with the service. I had to add 3/4 of a gallon of coolant to the radiator. They did not check my brake fluid levels they did not check the air filter for the engine they did not check the brake pads, so what did I pay for?   $125.70 for an oil change!  Not satisfied. Won't  recommend or return again. The only thing nice about the place was the men that work they were nice.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80ecf0e1441fecad:0xc7e30fe800ac2857<//gmap_id>< user_id>

No one was wearing their masks properly if at all. They also didn't check my tire pressure which I specifically asked for. However the machanics who spoke to me were polite.< /review>

I’ve always had great service at this Jiffy Lube location, but the efforts of Robert P and Lorena T to fix my headlight was amazing! Lorena special ordered my part for me, got it the same day, and Robert installed it within 5 minutes. I’m so thankful they put in so much effort to make my month-long problem fixed in a matter of minutes. Thanks again to Robert P and Lorena T for all of your work! I’ll be back in a jiff for all of my car needs :)< /Review>

<Text>First time going to jiffy lube for an oil change. I usually go to the dealership and pay $50. I payed $93 after a $10 coupon.... pretty expensive to me. I saw them clean my windows which was nice and they did tire air pressure as well but did not vacuum even though they say they did and didn’t mention the problems they found while servicing my vehicle but I saw it after I left on the papers given. It only took about 20 mins for them to finish. Overall I hoped for a little better for the price. Contemplating going back to the dealership even though I’m without a car all day.<//Text><date>1593530372875<//date><pictures>None</pictures><name>Lexiss East</name></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>I went in for an oil change, which is normally $99.
I asked them if they could rotate my tires,  they charged me.
My other service station rotated them for free. (Which I regret not going to but I was over my miles & jiffy lube was closer to my work)
Then they said I needed new filters one $59 the other $29.
They then said a light was out. I agreed that all things needed to be fixed.

I went to check out and they added $107 in labor for twenty minutes of work which was NEVER mentioned at all. I paid of course, but I will not be going back.
I am a younger woman and I don’t know much about cars. My total was almost $300. With them not disclosing the “labor” fees I felt completely taken advantage of.
I have needed filters replaced with my other service provider and NEVER have been charged that much.
Just beware, especially my follow ladies out there!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1597849901077, 'text': "Allie - I'm troubled by this feedback, and I want to apologize for what sounds like miscommunication.

Helpful and informative without projecting the sales-mentality pressure to fix anything unnecessary. During an oil change they found my tires were bald and there was a garden growing in my AC filter. The filter was a easy fix but they knew I wasn’t ready to pay for tires so they just printed out all the info for me so that I could be informed when I was ready< /review>

<Review>I went to the Jiffy Lube in Paso Robles to get an uber inspection.  They said I failed due to my tire treads being too low.  Tried to sell me 2 tires and an oil change.  I went to the one in slo and they passed my vehicle saying the tires had about 5000 more miles left in them, said they could match or beat my tire guys price.  They were quick, friendly and efficient.</Review>< UserId.>

Honestly yes, the prices are high--but the service was great! I love that they vacuumed my car, gave me a run-down, etc. Also you can almost always find coupons online so take advantage! These guys are open so much and work hard to give great service. Small waiting room for sure but I came on a Sunday for an oil change and only had to wait about fifteen minutes! Very good experience.< /Text>

Staff were very friendly and nice. I thought the price was kind of high, but they did it under 20 minutes. But they did forget to reset it on my dashboard!!! But I figured it out! All in all very friendly.< /Review>

Service was meh. This is my first time to this location. Guy didn’t believe me when I said I wanted a conventional oil change instead of a synthetic one, had to check for himself. Didn’t believe my coupon was legit, even though it came via email the previous day to my inbox, had to check twice for himself.

I know covid19 is going on right now, but they didn’t go over the completed checklist with me like they usually do when done. They didn’t vacuum my diver/passenger carpets like they usually do or inform me that they wouldn’t. It just said “rain check” on the form. Pshh.

When paying, I could see how greasy the credit card pin pad/pen was, probably never having wiped it down ever, despite the virus going on.< /text>

Chris helped me a lot in getting the service I needed done to my Honda Accord. I explained I was planning on selling it and needed to stay in budget and Chris figured out how to make it happen. Plus, after I was rung up he realized my wiper blades were out of stock he offered to go with the better blades at no charge. Extremely professional!< /text>

In the past, this place would be the only spot I would take my cars for oil changes. Over the past couple years, however, it has degenerated into a questionable business with low integrity employees that definitely do not have the customer's best interest in mind.  It feels like that grimy auto shop nobody should trust to work on their cars and actually charge them the right price. There have even been times recently that I've been lied to about pricing and denied promotions that I have been told are valid prior to arriving. Do yourself a favor and pass on these guys...we have plenty of better options in town. (And you really gotta try to get less than 3 out of 5 stars on Google reviews!)<//Review>

<review>Worse service EVER. Having a screw removed from tire. First one here. An hour and a half later, I am still here watching cars come and go. $30 is rediculous pricing. Will go to tire pro next time. Unreal, unfriendly and extremely poor service. Never again!!!<//review></record>

Chris was very helpful 😊 He replaced the  dead bulb on my car in a 'jiffy' and saved me from an anxious night on the road with one headlight. In fact, the whole JL gang was very friendly -- especially considering I stopped by at 4:45pm on a Friday.< /Text>

I went for a vehicle inspection.  Upon completion, Employees said I needed to replace front tires so I did.  I returned the following day and told I need back tires so I did.  The third day they improperly completed the inspection form.  This required a fourth visit.  I kept the back tires for proof, even the tire shop did an inspection on the first day saying everything was good.  I my mention the car was exactly 12 mo old.  I went for quick service which should have taken 2 days instead of four.  Jiffy made me buy parts I didnt need at the time.< /Text>

<review>Worst oil change experience I've ever had. Customer service was good up to the point of when they finished my car. They never billed me and I sat there for over an hour and a half. I had to get up, go outside, and personally check if my vehicle was ready. Then I had to approach the desk and ask for my keys. What a waste of time. Not to mention, they are extremely expensive. $50 for a standard oil change... Save your money and get the same exact services for cheaper at another place. I usually get mine for 30 bucks, 50 is ridiculous. Poor experience and poor desk staff.< /review>< Date>

Bye far the worst company to work for. The lack of H.R presences and professionalism in this company is outrageous the company is owned bye a man named Sean who rather avoid conflict with bully like employees, the management at this location is a joke a power trip type of person with horrible employee turn over and so much lack of leadership skills no proper delegation and or onboarding bye far the most hostel work place i have ever seen I fell bad for anyone working there or has  experienced  the horrible customer service Jeffy lube is a great company but this franchise location puts all their hard work branding too waste .< /Text>

Scammed. Told me they could only put synthetic oil in my car. Charged $100 for this lie and then didn’t honor the coupon on their website. I now pay $47 at Big Brand and they let me make appointments online that they always honor.< /review>

I was told by an employee to go pick up a application plus i needed a oil change in my 2015 Chevrolet equinox on 7/6/2018. When i arrived and patiently waited for a employee to get my application since he was busy helping another customer. At that time the female employee, which ended up being a manager, told me from across the shop they were busy and i needed to leave. From her rude manner i decided not to get my oil changed and ask to speak to her. When i address why i was there and that she was rude and unprofessional from the why she treated a potential employee plus customer she stated she didn't care and walked away. This shop really needs to train management.<//Text>

< Review>
I needed to get an oil change for my car, and was a little hesitant at first to say the least upon reading the reviews posted here. I decided to just go to Jiffy Lube since it's supposedly an easy in, easy out experience and it was all that I expected.

It seems like they've stepped up their game since the last comments giving them very low stars. I got in, was immediately greeted and taken care of and within 5 mins was told that my specific car needed synthetic oil, which sucks for my wallet but having not done an oil change for the past 12K miles(yes, I know that's not good :p) I had to get it done. I was given an estimate about everything they were charging me for, no up selling or anything of the sort. 5/5 for now! Good place to go currently.<//Review>

<review>For the love of God! Do not go to this business. They do not keep their appointment times straight for services. I went twice being told 2 different time frames for a vehicle inspection. I was also considering getting my oil changed and transmission flushed  but since I saw all the employees grouped around one vehicle and the rest of the maintenance bays emptied and they seemed to not really be motivated  to do their job and attend to the customer, I left. When I went there all the employees were grouped together with the Supervisor Josue or Jose talking and visiting while working on the only car there. I also noticed a person in plain clothes within the maintenance bay visiting with the group. I will also be contacting the regulatory entity that governs safety and requirements including the Better Business Bureau since this person that did not look like they were working was in an unsafe area for customers. Make sure you never ever go here unless the owner of this franchised establishment takes immediate corrective action.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I will never go back to another Jeffylube for the rest of my life because of this place. I have always had my vehicles serviced at jeffylubes across the country. Not only was it 70 dollars hire than the Toyota dealership(didn’t find that out till after). But this store is a rip-off. I paid 138.25 just for an oil change. They didn’t check anything else, because I left there still with my service light on for oil an windshield fluid, they didn’t even vacuum it out. Didn’t wash exterior winds like it said, I asked them not to mess with my tire pressure an they did. When I question the cashier Vincent his response was you can wait an hour for us to finish the other cars in line an then we will go back through you vehicle again to make sure it gets done right. My response was you had my truck in your Bay for an hour an a half, why would I trust you with it again, his response was I can take my business else where from now on. I can not believe the lack of professionalize at this place.  Lost a long time valves customers. An they didn’t even at eng treatment, invisiran window treatment, or the battery protection that I paid for!< /text>

DO NOT COME HERE, I REPEAT DO NOT COME HERE! Unless you have knowledge of your motor vehicles actual condition then don't risk coming here expecting a quick and cheap oil change. When I first moved to SLO I realized I needed to get an oil change so I went to the nearest company who I thought could get the job done. With my little auto vehicle knowledge, I was shocked when the employees told me I had to get so much done on my car when I simply wanted an oil change. Came in expecting a $60 dollar oil change, was told my inner cooler and other BS needed fixing and ended up paying $215. They take advantage of the younger population in this town to earn a quick buck. The guy who told me I needed all this fixes said "I'm just trying to help you out because this is exactly what I would tell my kids in this situation." Well of course I took his advice, but once I went back home I had my Dad check it out due to his automotive knowledge and of course nothing was done beside my oil change. SO HONESTLY I WOULD TRY AND AVOID THIS PLACE. I actually saw the employee who told me that a year later at Target and it took everything I had in my body to not confront him for taking advantage of a college student, especially one who's supporting himself.</review>

Well I should have read the reviews before going there, but I did not! Here I am needing an oil change to a new used car I purchased and so I printed out the coupon for jiffy lube, they advertise an oil change for 49.95, and the coupon was for 20.00 off, so I figured around 29.95, wrong! it costed me 44.30. I shoulda realized when I took the car there, I had a Buick Century which was clearly written on the back of the car, and they wrote down a Buick Regal that I was going to have nothing but troubles. So they said, I had a brake light out, so they fixed it, boy did they, when I was driving that night, my headlights did not work, and so I do plan on taking it back for them to fix it, but I am going to watch and stand right there, so they don't screw anything else up! Yeah, I will never take it back to Jiffy Lube for another oil change.</text>

<Review>I got an oil change on my 2002 Miata a week ago and the very next day the check engine light came on. I opened the hood to see if I could find the issue. The first thing I noticed was that they left the dipstick for my automatic transmission sitting on top of the radiator. I replaced it back into the check tube. I knew that wouldn't make the light come on so I kept looking. Couldn't find anything so I assumed it was the gas cap not being tight enough, which happens from time to time. After a week the car started running real rough so I brought it to the Mazda dealer and after a $165 diagnostic charge they found that a vacuum hose just above the oil filter had been knocked loose. So my $24.99 oil change cost me  $189.99. Needless to say, the "quick" service wasn't worth the few minutes I saved. I definitely won't go back again.< /Review><Time>1383684716366<//Time><rate>1< /rate>< user>

<Text>Let's start off with never use this place, the dealership is cheaper. My vehicle is a 2010 Scion Tc with low miles and no issues.

I needed a quick oil change and fluid top off as I was traveling back to Florida and wanted to be proactive. They charged me $47.59 for an oil change and fluid top off on Saturday. They said everything was full so no fluid top off, just a charge for it. Two hours into my journey cross country, we broke down from overheating. After $200 for tow and 6 hours of waiting, we arrived in San Luis Obispo on Saturday night. I took it to the Toyota Dealership on Monday and told them what happened. They all laughed and made jokes about "Jiffy Screwed". For $50 at Toyota, they flushed all fluids, performed a leak down test, block test, and inspection. Boom, problem was the "professionals" at Jiffy Lube unplugged my radiator fan and didn't fully tighten my radiator cap.

With all due respect, F*** these guys. They cost me $250 in towing and inspection and the cost of 3 days of hotels in SLO. All for a $50 oil change.

Save your hard earned money and go to a dealership or a different service shop. First and last time I'll go there.< /Text><userid>113195767788827626669<//userid></record>

< Review>
My oil dipstick broke during my oil change at Jiffy Lube on Higuera st, San Luis Obispo. Dereck told me that it just snapped as they where pulling it out. Of course I wasn't happy and I asked Martin over the phone to figure out a way to fix what I thought it was their fault. I was wrong! I came home and did a research and found out that this is a common problem with newer models having a plastic tip. I stop by JL to let them know about my findings and they still were able to credit my debit card for the cost of the new dip stick $16.15. Derek and Martin went beyond my expectations. I have been their customer since 2012 and I am not going anywhere else for my oil changes. Now I just have to figure out how to remove the rest of the old dipstick. Thanks Jiffy Lube!< /Review>

I waited 2+ hours to have my oil changed and tires rotated. Then when I called them afterwards with a problem with my tires, they proceeded to tell me I was not in their system. When I called a second time I was called "love" and told I needed to call back at a later time because he didn't have time to help me at that moment.
Will NEVER return to this Jiffy Lube or any for that matter.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Brand new Kia Soul 2016. The did not tighten something properly on oil change (in which they attempted to charge me $60). When I had Kia Glendale do next oil change, it was noticed then. Oil leaking all over the under carriage. Oil supposed to be lubricating moving engine parts, not coating your catlytic converter.

That substandard service from San Luis Obispo Jiffy Lube can't be good for my new car, which will cost me $30,000 over the life of the payments.

This is not a revenge rating. This place simply should be avoided for the sake of your investment.

So, help yourself and find a place you can trust.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80ecf0e1441fecad:0xc7e30fe800ac2857<//Gmap_id>< Time>

<response>None<//response><text>Avoid Jiffy Lube at 110 Higuera, or find a Jiffy Lube in another town.  They are scam artists.  Their TV ad shows their whole team (about 10 people, including the owner and his son), and the owner said if we aren't happy, we are not happy.  Read below for my experience and run away from this team.

The last time I went to Jiffy Lube at 110 Higuera, I asked only for an oil and filter change.  I asked for what my 2005 Honda Hybrid owners manual recommended which was premium-grade OW-20 Detergent oil displaying the API Certification Seal.  My Honda Civic Hybrid holds 3.4 quarts with filter change.   My bill was about $100, even though I turned down all their suggested items,  including new windshield wipers, engine air filter, and cabin air filter among other items.

I went to O'Reilly's Auto Parts at 146 South Street (about 100 yards from Jiffy Lube) and bought windshield wiper's, engine intake filter, and cabin air filter which I easily installed in the O'Reilly's parking lot.  I was having trouble installing the windshield wiper blades so one of the O'Reilly employees came out and installed one for me (really easy), and I then installed the other.

My next oil and filter change was done at the Sunset Honda dealer on Los Osos Valley.  The total bill was $25.95.  They installed a synthetic blend oil and filter and performed a free multi-point check, and topping off all of the car's vital fluids; including tire pressure, tread wear level, transmission fluid's, window washer fluid.  Then they washed my car and vacuumed the interior.  Good Grief, all of this for $25.95.</text><Time>1476382818983<//Time></record>

This is my favorite little juice spot after a morning workout in South Orange County. Yes, it is fairly corporatized, but they serve a mean strawberry surf rider with extra lime and vitamins that is very refreshing in the desert summer sun. If I am working out in South Orange County, then this spot is definitely a tasty treat for cool down. When you truly find things that you love, making a routine out of them is never boring. Routines built on love seem to last. Your life and light shines bright, even on a day when things don't go smoothly. Enjoy your Jamba!<//review>

I ordered doordash from this location. My order was a Pitaya Bowl. Apparently they were out of banana, but I was never called and made aware of this, or asked if I would like to exchange it for a different fruit, or offered a refund for my order. They wrote a note in sharpie on my lid that they had added extra strawberries, which I never asked for. Very unprofessional.<//text>

<Text>The smoothies are delicious and the oatmeal is super tasty especially since you can customize it to your likings. The reason why the 2 star is because within my last 3 visits 2 out of the 3 times something has gone wrong. The first time they never received my order that I made online, so had to wait extra while it was made. The 3rd time which was my last time I placed another online order which is how I normally order. I got there and my smoothie was there but they had no oatmeal. Ok so I asked for a refund something that couldn't be done because I ordered it online. They never offerred to give me something else in its place. They reached out to their manager and the manager didn't know how to refund an online order. They mentioned that they would get back to me and never did. I stated in the note my information that if they were able to refund it or not it was okay but I still expected some sort of call to at least let me know the outcome. The staff is great but their ordering system not so much that's the reason for the low score maybe they should also have some kind of protocol for when situations like this happen especially when they're so rare from what it looks like.<//Text>< pics>

I like to put the straw up my butt hole. People don't judge they just stare... for a while but hey, it's California am I right? Also one time I ordered a ice cream thing and they gave me a spoon.  A FREAKING SPOON. I asked for a straw and they said no because you can't drink it through a straw. So I stole a spoon and the money at them and ran and now, I use uber eats to get all my jamba juice straws</Review>

< review>
Stopped in for a late breakfast and to admire the retro style photos on the walls. I had the bacon, cheese, avocado omelet with hash browns.  It was generously filled and cooked perfectly. Husband had the breakfast burrito. We both cleaned our plates and look forward to coming back with friends. Good food, nice portions and reasonably priced. And, attentive service; we didn't have to hunt down a server for beverage refills - they were on top of it.<//review>

Had the veggie omelet and the veggies were pouring out! We also had the Belgium waffle which was legit! It was crispy and fluffy and perfect! The biscuits and gravy are out of this world! Finally a flavor filled gravy! Love this place, I just wish they served alcohol.  Mimosas are a must for me when having breakfast put and it was the only thing this place lacked, that's why the 4 stars instead of 5. And b4 I forget the customer service is great, super sweet servers who know the menu items and can point u in the right direction.<//review><Rate>4< /Rate>< Pictures>

My family and I have been eating at Zee's for years. Best homemade tasting meals in town from a great and affordable restaurant.
The staff is pretty incredible as well!</Review>

Ordered the Zee's Burger (pastrami, Swiss cheese, 1000 island dressing, all toppings) with Fries and coffee. The pictures don't lie, the burger is taller than the coffee cup. Made it a challenge to eat but very worth it. Pastrami was tasty on it own as was the beef patty. One of the best burgers I've had in years!
The waitress was very nice, brought extra napkins without prompt and even reminded me about the my to go box I was walking away from. She also clued me in to the lack of portion control. Shouldn't leave hungry from a diner. No danger of this happening here!
If you like diner food and environment check this place out for your next meal... assuming it Breakfast or Lunch, closes at 3p.<//text>< pictures>

Service was prompt Ordered a Chef Salad.. Salad in my opinion was mediocre at best hence the 3 stars. Other dishes might be better but can not say.<//review>

<review>Zoe's Diner. A little Alice of Americana at this little diner. Feels like Mel's Diner with a little different vibe and the amount of food was plentiful.  Pictured is one thing that Google Maps can update is that this location is Open for Dine In as of mid-June during Covid restriction being lifted.

Also the Burger was thick and delicious compared to other Diners.  Other items tried were the serving size of the Salad.  The other good tasting item tried is the Hot Wings.  Our server was awesome and friendly.

I give this place a solid 4 Stars.  Unfortunately, this place doesn't have any Military or Veterans Discount.  For the residents of Santa Rosa, I hope this place stays around for traveler's like me.<//review>< name>

<Review>I really enjoyed my breakfast here, I wasn't able to finish everything because they give a lot. Their menu is decent and the prices are not that bad. This spot is definitely on par with the other diners in town I would recommend it and will be sure to be back!< /Review>< rating>

<Review>Really fast and cheap American style food that tastes really good.

My dad who's always hard to please really loved this places chocolate shake, and their chicken salad sandwich, and he always has something to complain about.

My spicy chicken sandwich was scrumptious. Little messy but I expected that, but it was really tasty and very filling.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Nice waitress. Staff polite. Came in thru drive thru, but apparently it has never been open? Too bad because with Covid- and having my dog in tow, after leaving Oregon fires, smoke & ash, I needed a good home cooked style breakfast without all the stress of leaving my poor dog in a hot truck while being exposed to COVID, indoors while ordering. I had to back up in reverse, since drive thru does not have a closed sign, nor a roped off area. How many times do the employees sit and laugh at the customers expense due to this failure on the owners part? Boo! The food was good though. And prices fair. No trash can around to dispose of to-go containers. Lots of homeless in back side of restaurant near grassy hill and trees. They have outdoor dining but like I said, THERE'S A PANDEMIC ON PEOPLE! No masks, crowded together outdoors. Might as well open the restaurant and keep doors open. Come on City of Santa Rosa. Give them a free drive thru permit for Lord's Sakes! You guys make enough taxes off of everyone.</text>< pics>

Good food, big portions, friendly staff. Old Wendy's location that has been nicely updated. Plenty of space and easy to hear conversations(your own tables). Great corned beef hash that is crispy and not salty. Huge salads, big sandwiches with lots of side choices. Very affordable, lots of parking and yes, you can drive by it many times on Cleveland and never notice it. Notice it and stop by you will be happy you did.</Text>

First time at the diner. It was ok. I had the chicken fried steak because someone raved about it. The steak was ok, kind of thin. But the gravy was really peppery. Hash browns were good. No butter for the biscuit was given. Hubby had a cheese omelet he said was good. I'll give the another chance. Maybe try a lunch next.<//Review>

I'm keto. The restaurant uses soy oil which I can't have but I carry my olive and avacado oil with me. The restaurant used my product to prepare my food. Kuddos to this resturant for allowing me to enjoy a meal with friends.

My food was absolutely delicious!<//text>

Need a non chain diner that offers comfort food that'll go straight to your hips? Look no further! This diner is busy, efficient, detail oriented and friendly. Walk in the door and the smells invite you in further. Once your food arrives it's plated without looking like pig slop. The first taste will make you happy. Go ahead give this place a try. You will be very happy you did!<//text>

The food was so delicious and fresh, my veggie scramble was beautiful. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were large. They open a little later than other breakfast places, but that didn't deter anyone. A great visit and a great meal.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>ordered 2 sandwiches to go

ordered the spicy chipotle chicken sandwich for me (i specified no cheese) & when i received it, there was cheese. i went back in to get it replaced, witnessed some bickering between a server & the chef. i guess it turns out when i called in my order, she wrote “ON cheese” not “NO cheese”. then they replaced my sandwich. i ate it, it wasn’t *BAD* but it was easily 80% bread. the chicken was really thin.

i ordered the NY steak sandwich for my dad. he told me to write a review. should of taken a picture of our sandwiches. he says & i quote “first of all there was a ton of lettuce. not sure why they would put so much lettuce on my sandwich. I had to take half of it off. Possibly the lettuce was masking the very thin steak underneath. The steak was not seasoned, very bland , hard and chewy unchewable chunks. the bread was chewy like it was old & stale. the overall presentation looked like a child put it together. not what i expected from a 4.5 star establishment.”

my dad’s a pretty serious man. although his response made me laugh, he’s right. the sandwiches were mediocre at best.

the potato salad was bomb though, 2 stars for the potato salad.</Text>< Rating>

The service is really nice and fast and the food is delicious and you get big servings. Only downside is that they only have two highchairs so if they're both taken then you're out of luck and have to use your stroller, but the drawers staff is really nice about it if you have to.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< Rate>

Would like it better if the waitresses actually wore clothes and NOT yoga pants and tight tshirts. We get it, you want a tip. Here's a tip be professional and courteous and the tips will come.

<review>Delicious! We decided to try this place out since we stayed at a hotel nearby. We definitely didn't want to struggle with getting a table at Denny's and boy we're we Happy to make that decision. The food is amazing 😍! We got the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich and was the best sandwich I've ever tried. My bf also got the Breakfast special with Waffle's and he also enjoyed his food. The staff is extremely friendly and the place itself has a nice vibe. Great place, next time we travel to Santa Rosa we will definitely make another stop.</review>< UserId.>

I got DoorDash so I can't speak to the service but the food was really good. They did not skimp on the avocado in my omelette and somehow managed to put it inside without it getting too warm. Delicious hash browns that are not too greasy and just the right amount of crisp. I will be ordering again!</Review>

<Text>I ordered corned beef hash with eggs because the menu said it was fresh made. The corned beef? was little tiny hard crumbles of something and no potatoes in it. Just some hard crumbles. It was awful...what a waste of money. Also, the floor was dirty and over all it wasn't a very clean place. The waitress was nice though and have good service.<//Text>< Resp>

Staff was friendly. Place was clean. There were many people who were regulars. I had the smothered omelette. It was well prepared. It just needed a little more zip . Other people's food looked good and they seemed to really enjoy it.<//text>

THE Best Diner in Santa Rosa. The food is always ample and excellent. The service is always cheerful and efficient. The prices are always surprisingly reasonable …considering the quality of the product delivered. Do try Zee's Diner. You will thank me.<//Text>

We dined here for breakfast.  I had a simple cheese omelet and my husband had a triple meat (ham, bacon and sausage) with eggs and cheese scramble.  Both were top notch.  Fresh and prepared perfectly.  Oh, and the servers..the most friendly and effecient.  When we were leaving all three waitresses called out "Thank you!" as we were walking out the door.  We will most certainly return!<//Review>

Not the greatest breakfast I've had but better food and MUCH larger portions than what you'd typically get at Denny's for about the same price.  Service was very accommodating and fast.</review>

<text>The three of us arrived at Zees (formerly Brody's) 10:30ish sunday morning, it was packed. There was a wait, kinda long. We read the menus while we waited. When our table was finally ready, there was a generous plate of fresh fruit, it was so nice, on the house for such a long wait. We all had coffee water and juice, coffee was great, so was juice perfect temp without ice for my tastes. I had 2 eggs, over medium (whites cooked yellow a little runny), bacon, hash browns, crispy bacon and sourdough toast, all cooked perfectly and severed on a warm plate. The other two plates were huge and they loved it. We even ordered milk shakes, they wrre delicious as well. Great little place, warm hospitality and good food.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>(Translated by Google) You should not expect great gastronomy: this is a typical American family dinner (comfort food) but the portions are generous and the prices quite low. The dishes are well executed (delicious lunch quesadillas) served with homemade hashbrowns. It is absolutely necessary to mention the charm of Angelina (?)! Excellent experience in Santa Rosa.

First time here. No crowd but took longer than expected to be seated. Once seated the service is great. The food is prepared simply and the portions are generous. Very clean tasting. Could use a little more seasoning but it’s still good. The atmosphere and decor is nice (bar and grill type). You can’t go wrong here.< /text>

Albondigas is good and very filling. Their rice is very good as well. The fajitas are visually appealing but id pass on them.<//Text>

El Patron is an excellent Mexican restaurant with good tasting food and with giant portions. Weekend brunch is the best deal in town. There are several breakfast items -- all for $7.95. My wife and I split s breakfast and there is always enough left over for another person.

Service is fast and extremely fast. We eat here every weekend and we have never been disappointed.</Review>

Bad customer service. The waiter did not check on us once. We had to continuously ask him to bring us things to our table. We ordered fajitas, well done, but they were undercooked. Furthermore, we were not done eating and another waiter was already picking up our plates. The only reason they're getting 1 star is becuase I can't give them 0 stars. Also, the restroom was dirty.</Review>

<Text>Big portions and unlike previous teviews we were seated quickly, got chips salsa and drinks within minutes. We ordered enchiladas and carnitas dishes. Huge hot plates came within 15 minutes. Can't complain the AC was working and the food was good. Menu offered lots of upscale items plus seafood dishes< /Text>< Date>

<review>Good food. Good service. -1* because only the portion of the dining room closest to the front door was open. It was very cold outside and every few minutes an icy draft flooded through. A conscientious restaurant owner would have opened the far half of the dining room.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Great service, great prices, great food!! Delicious chili verde and eggs!!! I am so picky about my rice and they have really great rice too. It's hard to find a great Mexican Food Restaurant in a sea of them, however, this one is on the top of my list. 😊<//Text>

The food was really, REALLY excellent! However, our server was fairly forgetful and just flat out lazy. Twice, I had to go looking for her to just get some napkins and drink refills. And that was after waiting patiently both times for more than 10 minutes. I would absolutely eat here again, and I plan to, but I will definitely be making sure I move if seated in her section.<//Text>

The food was good, nice and hot. Ordered a rum and coke from the bar, and got rum and water. Was never asked if i needed or wanted another drink. The service.....well lacking in personality and concern for her patrons needs. That's why the score is a "2".< /text>

<text>Terrible service we were there for over 2 and a half hours and not once did the waiters bother to check on us. When our food arrived we had to ask for utensils and they didnt bother to ask us if we needed any refills. The food was ok but the service was awful. I wont be coming back to this place.</text>< name>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Meea's is a small family-owned & run hot dog place in Eagle  Rock with a very pleasant patio. As a vegetarian, I have a choice of a mild or spicy bean-based hot dog to sub for their beef ones,  and just add ingredients from there, including any of their regular specialties. Great fries/tots,  good cole slaw, everything very fresh.<//review>< Pictures>

Haven't been here in a few years, but I'm glad I came back. Probably should give 5 stars but its a hot dog! Got the Seattle dog cuz it had cream cheese on it and the cook gave me the thumbs up on my choice when I asked his opinion.  I rarely eat hot dogs but ill be back. Fries are solid too.</Review>

Got a chicago dog and a chili cheese dog with spicy beef. Order was up quicker than grub hub said it would be. I'm from Chicago. I've eaten hundreds of chicago dogs in Chicago and all over the country. This one was really solid. No vienna beef but everything about it was spot on. Chili dog was tasty too.

One hotdog will fill you up. Bigger than the standard dog.</review>

Cool little low key spot for gourmet hot dogs. Truly enjoyed my dog that had grilled, onions, jalapenos, and bacon.  Price was about the average for Eagle Rocks crowd. Not a bargain but not outrageous either. Depends what you get. Wish they would have a big sign or paint the place a brighter color so it's noticeable. Overall cool place to have a hot dog and chill.</Text>

Excellent specialty hot dog place. Indoor and outdoor seating. Fantastic craft beer selection. Limited street parking but it'd not too far from the green street parking lot.< /Review>

<text>Most life changing hot dog I've ever eaten in my life. It's a little messy to eat with all of the sauces and toppings put in the hot dog, but the combination of the whole thing is just an explosion of delicious flavors. It tends to get crowded easily, but that's with good reason. The line is worth the wait. One hot dog is usually enough to fill you up if you have late night munchies. I've put this in the fridge over night before too and it still tasted good the next day!<//text>< Pictures>

First off, the hot dogs are great!  The only reason for not giving the 5 stars was how hot it was inside, the table was very sticky.  I will be back because there are more hot dogs I want to have and the staff was very friendly.< /review>

<Text>Good quality hot dogs with a variety of fun toppings.  The fries are shoe string style, very crunchy which I love. Everything is made fresh to order.  Friendly staff. Limited seating inside but large patio.  Parking is limited as well, 4 spots but plenty of street parking.</Text>< user_id>

<review>Had to stop and try it out considering the history.  Who doesn't luv hotdogs? These were quite special and we didn't have to wait in an enormous line either! Being from the east coast I had to the Brooklyn dog and wasn't disappointed. Make it a stop on your CA travels.<//review>< pics>

Always consistent and made to order. Tasty hot dogs. Corn dogs are made in house so you choose beef or turkey. Great shoestring skin on fries.</text>

I'd never been to Meea's but my couple friends are apparently regulars and love this spot for their Chicago-style with a veggie dog. I popped away from the uncomfortable argument and snuck in for 3 of the same, Chicago-style with a veggie dog. The orders took a few minutes and they loaded up the wieners with all the essential Chicago goodies. The buns here are more brat-style buns and not the typical Chicago poppyseed kind, but they're still good. My only tweak for next time is that I'd ask for extra sport peppers bc those are the best part, obviously.<//review>

Meh.  The ingredients in my Chicago Dog were fresh and good, however they put SO MUCH salt on the dog that I could barely taste them.  The worst part of the experience was the ghetto rap music which was blaring during my visit.< /text>

Small but good selection of hot dogs including vegan dog. The bun is not vegan, I believe.<//Review>

Excellent spot for authentic hot dogs. Definite plus for the backyard home warming dining area.</text>

TRANSCENDS HODDOGS. My fiancée is a hotdog person, I wasn't. But then I had their "southland" and I lost my mind. Excellent prices and a very quaint outdoor eating area. Will be coming back.< /Text>

If they are even remotely busy, go somewhere else unless waiting for 35 minutes for a hot dog is okay.  Add:. The guy at the front counter just literally flipped out on me.  Weirdest experience ever.  He kicked me out after I asked for more ice tea.<//review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>What a joke!  For a $20.00 pizza you should get exactly what you paid for.  When I called back, I was schooled on how they measure toppings.  She wanted to tell me all the reasons I am wrong and that the toppings were under the cheese, they weren't.  In life and business school you're taught that the customer is always right. One of the toppings wasn't even there. Did I call expecting an apology, yes.  I think a replacement pizza (since only one slice partially eaten) would have been a good idea. This employee  should not ever speak with customers.  Domino's never ever acted this way with me and I feel mad at myself for trying a new pizza place.  You don't need little Miss Argue too.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>On 9-30-2019, I used the mobile app to place and prepay for an order at around 11pm.  The mobile app says this location closes at 11:25 (presumably last order accepted time) as this locations actual closing time is midnight on Saturdays).

I drove there to find a notification on my phone that my order had been cancelled and the store empty with lights and oven turned off (belt wasn't moving).

It is unacceptable to be closed during published open times.  A company can be sued for something this petty, and this is an inconsiderate way to run a business.  Even if someone couldn't have been there, then it's the assistant or general managers responsibility to fill in.  If the owner doesn't like paying overtime-- too bad, it's cheaper than being taken to court in this sue-happy society.

I won't do business here again.  I am a busy professional, and a full time student, so for me to get away to splurge on a pizza over the weekend is tough enough without it taking me double the time when I'm already having to 'burn the midnight oil.'

Domino's was open and pleased to have my business, and since they're dependable, they'll continue to have my business.</Review>< Rating>

<text>Mediocre food and dangerous bone spur.
I almost broke my tooth on this bone in my first bite of the chicken bbq Pappadias.  I spent $75 on what I was hoping would be a special treat.
I'll try Pizza Hut next time or get nothing, it's safer.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMpsqLanDy0j9noLi8OIxnHwzqKb4G-cerMi_1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><time>1585862398294< /time><response>None</response>< rate>

I just wanted to give a huge shout out to this Papa John's location in Thousand Oaks!! I called them from Layton, Utah and asked them to deliver a pizza to a set of missionaries in the Thousand Oaks area which is a little tricky due to the missionaries schedule. When I spoke with James T. on the phone, he was so understanding and willing even though there were a tricky set of circumstances.  He relayed the instructions to the driver.  I received a call from the delivery driver, who happen to also be named James, explaining that the missionaries were not home, however he was willing to wait.  Although I just asked that he leave it, the gesture was kind and thoughtful considering the circumstances.  My intentions were to feed a couple of missionaries who are on a service mission and this team at Papa John's could see my intentions and helped me carry them out, and for this I am truly grateful!! Thank you so much!! I know you all will be blessed for your kindness:)< /review>

<Text>Perhaps things have improved over the years.  We're in Oak Park.  Placed an order for Papa John's while watching football on Sunday... those commercials work.  It took 45 minutes to arrive, which was the time they said it would take (it's a 15 minute drive.)  The delivery guy was courteous & professional.  I guess I would have given them a 5-star review if they had gotten it here faster.

Oh, and the pizza was great!</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80e8301f135a3fc3:0xaa85b3b37a6ad8f</GmapID></record>

The difference with Papa John's is that I get the Pizza the WAY I WANT here! No fuss, no worries, always fresh ,always corteous, always fast, always beyond satisfactory. And to top it off there's always a special for whatever day of week you happen to be ordering.....all with just a few swipes on my phone.....and done. Best Pizza Period.</review>

Over the phone I tried to placed an order for a large, regular crust, one topping pizza, that I would pick up.  I was quoted $14.40. I commented that in Los Angeles I pay $7.60 for the same product. I was cursed and abruptly hung up on. Thanks for the service!  I think Papa Johns need to do a better job of training his boy!

I told the truth I usually pay $7.60 for the same pizza in Culver City, Ca.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Their patio is warm and inviting with ample heat lamps and view of the lake. The staff is above and beyond in every way. Amazing people. I’ve been coming here almost every week since moving to oakland. Thank you for having us.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>We sat outside on the back deck on a warm, sunny day. The service is great and the food delicious. I had a Cobb salad and the blue cheese and crispy bacon made it fabulous. My brother had the burger and it came rare the way he likes it. A friend had the stuffed French toast and it was marvelous. Highly recommend Portal. Get there early or quite late as it is usually very crowded. People share picnic type tables with strangers if there’s room at a table. Worth the wait!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Overpriced and awful to go orders. Talk about a rip off. I remember having a good experience as a sit down a couple years ago, but I will never order to go again. The staff also ignored me for 4 minutes when I needed to pick up my order.

If you are looking for a great brunch place and need to get to go or even sit down I recommend the Grand Lake Kitchen. Tasty food and great portions< /review>

Cute patio, good service, okay food. Terrible wait list experience. Told us it would be half an hour, when I checked in with the host an hour later he told me they had stopped seating people ten minutes ago. Don’t know when they planned to communicate that to us. Refused to seat us. Won’t be coming back. Maybe that will improve the waitlist.</review>

<Review>The burger is top notch, best burger I've had in Oakland so far. I asked for it to be made medium and it came out perfectly medium. Juicy, moist and full of flavor. The fries do a good job as a supporting cast but nothing memorable. We also had the garbage bread and the brussel sprouts and it was also amazing. I highly recommend them as well as the burger.< /Review><GmapID>0x808f873750f40fdd:0x12e85a66d545597f<//GmapID>< Name>

We decided to try this spot for a Sundat breakfast/brunch.  The only negative is the long wait.  Took approximately an hour before getting called to be seated.  In the meantime you can do a stroll along the lake and support some of the local vendors set up at the lake on Saturdays and Sundays.  Food is good, drinks are strong and service was good.  Neighborhood can be a little difficult in navigating a parking spot, might be better to rideshare it to the location.<//text>

< Review>
A very nice waiter assisted with my order since it was my first time there. I wanted the sliders, he suggested the stuffed turkey so I mixed them up, I got the fried chicken and turkey. I was splitting my meal so I asked them to cut it in half and they did EVENLY ☺️ and with no problem! Secondly I ordered the Cesar salad which was a great partner to my turkey and chick sliders. Everything was delicious, I will be back and I really want to try their bread. Great place, good food and perfect location!< /Review>

I’m a Doordash driver., I got here and asked the order., cashier  in the front door wasn’t that helpful., she asked I need to wait 10 min for the order., after 5 Mn I asked if she knows how longer more I need to wait so I can communicate with costumer., she said she is no in the kitchen so she don’t know.!
If I need to know to cancel the order I said if I can talk to manager she said I just need to wait 10mn well I have to wait because I have no access to cancel order for Doordash!?</text>

Colossal waste of our time. I’ve worked at several restaurants, it’s not hard to avoid this. And they didn’t offer a thing for their mistake except that we could buy their mediocre food to go. Just avoid this place.< /review>< pictures>

I love the vegan/vegetarian options here. The food is yummy with great portions. The outdoor seating is very nice and they are very clean and taking precautions for covid. There is temp check and a sanitizer station when you 1st arrive. Great deals on mimosas as well!< /text>

Chill vibe, friendly staff and solid food. Plenty of space to grab lunch with a friend, a beer after work, or get some work done in the middle of the day. Be sure to check out the patio!</Review>

<Text>I've been coming here since around 2012 and I have always enjoyed the local rotating selection of beers, the view, and courteous staff. The food is not all that good and a bit pricey too. However, they do offer food that should suit omnivors, vegetarians, and vegans.<//Text>< name>

<Text>Arrived a few minutes before the joint opened and they welcomed me in with open arms! Sat out on their beautiful deck with great views of the lake. I ordered the Garbage Bread. Very interesting dish and soooo good! A bit pricy at $16.50 but honestly, I liked it so much I’d probably order again without hesitation. Would be a great item to share with a group as well. It’s basically a grilled pizza burrito. I’m getting hungry just typing about it.<//Text>< pictures>

We went here as we love "local" hangouts and the Portal fit the bill. The beer menu was nicely curated with something for everyone. The breweries selected were diverse and upper tier. Food was really quite good - we had calamari (excellent), pan seared salmon (good), 1/2 burger (excellent), and Cesar salad (ok). Service was friendly but the timing of delivery of food was a bit off - but I am not terribly concerned about that as it was just me and my friend and I had ordered my entree a few minutes after the initial order - I just figured they would wait a bit on his burger and serve them together.< /text>

The best place for brunch. Amazing food; I recommend the garbage break and pork belly salad. Solid bloody Mary's! Awesome staff, very friendly and accommodating.

Get there before 11 on Saturday's because there's usually a line of about 20 people. Totally worth the wait.< /text>

Great place to come for brunch. The highlight is definitely the bottomless mimosas, tasty food and great service. There is usually a line on weekends, so it's best to get there early. The have indoor and outdoor seating and can accommodate big groups.  The food was great all around and they have all the usual goodies, from burritos, sausage and gravy to vegan variations.</review>

<review>Went here for brunch and bottomless mimosas! Food was tasty, had a great view of the lake, and the mimosas were flowing! (some places claim bottomless but don't check in for refills, here, they had one dude on refill duty just going around with a pitcher!) Only negatives was that I tried making a reservation (knowing that they get busy) and they said if we walk in, we would not have a problem getting a table but ended up waiting 35 mins for a table for 2. Also, once being sat, it took 3 conversations with back waiters and 15 min for our server to come talk to us. However, once we got our food (I had the GCCB - posted) we had a great time.< /review>< gmapID>

Really love to have Portal as an option that's literally 10min walk from where we live. I love coming here, seating on the community tables outside by the patio with a great view of the lake and exchanging sweet moments with your loved one and getting to know your neighbours!
Portal is exactly that, bringing people together. Love their indoors variety of seating by the tall tables, low tables and the lovely bar. Outside is great too with long community tables that easily accommodate 8-10 people and a lovely view of Lake Merritt :)

Prices are well balanced tho some dishes tend to get expensive like the carb loaded garbage bread priced at 18$, tho you get 4 big slices. I think the best way to go here is share the food since portions are quite generous. Love the choices on the menu. Impressed there were quite a few veg starters, salads and couple entres too.

We came on a Friday night at about 7ish and were quickly accommodated outside.
Between the two of us we shared plate of [6] hot spicy chicken wings and hot pastrami. Love the hot spicy sauce, it has the right amount of kick without being too spicy. The pastrami on rye was delicious, no mayo and whole grain mustard? YES!!! And love me their house made pickles. I make homemade pickles all the time so I can attest these were delicious!

All in all, we really had a great time and the bill only came to about 30 something $ for 2 plates and 2 beers which ain't bad I think. Service was on point and very friendly and efficient.

I haven't come yet for brunch here but dying to try :)<//Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>I went here for brunch with a couple friends Saturday morning. This place has a great bet selection, a wide variety a good which caters to restrictions in diet, and amazing cocktails! I have never liked a bloody Mary before, but Portal does it right. They make their own mix so it doesn't taste like Campbell's tomato soup with Tabasco. They also put in their house made pickles. So good. I had the pork belly salad with poached egg. It was delicious, filling and low carb! Hell yeah! I would have given this place five stars, but the bathroom situation is not amazing. There is one bathroom in a place that serves bottomless mimosas, and its located in a walkway.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Pretty cool place. Looks like a legitimate neighborhood "dive bar" from outside but once inside you'll get more of a modern-ish hipster vibe. Service was great with a good micro beer selection. I had a "beyond burger" for the first time and was impressed. Outside deck/patio is great and the heating lamps made the deck bearable on a cold night. The deck is undoubtedly awesome when the weather is right. The place should have additional restrooms built (assuming there is enough space) and the music was mostly great.<//review>< userid>

<Text>Awesome outdoor patio with views of Lake Merritt. Went to try the garbage bread but everything looked good. Wait can be an hour or more for weekend brunch so plan accordingly. Seating out back is communal so will likely be sharing with a group. They only have one bathroom and the line can get long.</Text><user_id>117516228292295973555< /user_id><rate>4< /rate></record>

The food is the only thing decent about this place. Otherwise it's just two overworked waiters running around with no time to give anyone a decent experience. We were sat after 55 minutes, 15 minutes later than stated, and it was after a bunch of people who had arrived later were already seated because apparently you can check in on Yelp. This was a real middle finger to everyone who didn't know about the Yelp heck in, in my opinion. Finally we were seated with a great view of the homeless camp outside.<//Review>

Nice place for a meal with a sweet view of Lake Merritt! 😃👍 It's quieter, but colder & less comfortable, to sit out on the patio with nice lake views. I'd have given it 5 stars were it not for the fact that I looked over to see my "bench neighbor" eating EXACTLY what I wanted but didn't see on the menu! Turns out it was the daily special; BUT our server NEVER MENTIONED ANY SPECIALS, & being my FIRST time here. I didn't know to ASK! I had a very good pork belly salad. BUT I WANTED THOSE RIBS!!! I'd have liked to at least be TOLD about them!!<//text>

Portal is always a great weekend cozy brunch/early afternoon spot to chill. I've sat both outside and inside and have enjoyed both. Something about a bottle of bubbly rose, comfort food and a relaxing atmosphere with friendly staff makes for a great weekend day. It doesn't hurt that the pie spot a couple doors down does chicken pot pie, cookies and mini pies. Nomnomnom

Pros: Cozy environment, patio and indoor options
Cons: Can get busy at peak times
Bottom line: Good comfort food and drinks spot by the Lake so you can walk it off after or before if that's your thing<//text>

UNLIMITED MIMOSAS! I love this place. It's very interpersonal and the staff are upbeat and engaging. The bartender there is always nice and enjoys conversing. Their food never let's me down, they know the importance of serving food with high expectations rather than the normal "it's what the people would eat." I've been here three times and never had an issue.</text>

<text>We had the meat garbage. The bread was amazing, perhaps too much meat for my girlfriend but the sauces were really good. Plates are big. We shared the meat garbage and was more than enough. We would come back for the French that’s make from challah bread!
Great selection of bears, we had the laughing monk.
Good service as well. We couldn’t decide between which beer to have and they let us tried a couple of beers before we order.
Chill place, good music, with a great terraza.
Near to the lake.
I would suggest on weekend to first sign in for the waitlist and then have a walk around the lake ;) while waiting. Enjoy Oakland!</text>< pictures>

Well, everything about this place is amazing. The wait is absolutely worth it...scheduling ahead and reserving a table is also absolutely worth doing as well! First off the brunch, drinks are amazing! nice and strong, great staff, friendly, efficient, kind and lovely service. The atmosphere is amazing. It is a pretty small place with two single bathrooms, so sometimes there can be a bit of a wait for that however, the food. The food is everything, especially those french fries. They have the garlic aoili type sauce that is incredible. We didn't think we wanted fries, but I am so happy that we got those fries. They have hands down some of the best comfort food I'd ever had. Great place, must go if you're in Oakland, great area to walk around after as well!<//text>

<Review>Came here on a Saturday and it was quite busy. We got our table after 20 minutes even though we had reservations. We waited another 30 minutes to get a server to come over to our table to take our order even though we asked other staff to help us get a server 3 times!

I had a GCCB, which was fried chicken on biscuit. It was 3/5 for me. The chicken wasn't crunchy, almost tasted microwaved. The sauce on it was a bit too salty as well. The presentation for most of the dishes from Portal looked really nice and vibrant,

Overall, nice atmosphere, sub-par service and food.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1578585884552, 'text': "Helen, we missed the mark on our service this time around, and I do apologize.

<text>Love this place for its outdoor patio and brunch. Stellar bloody marys- I especially like the version called Mr. Pickles with house made pickles. Get the eggs Benedict. Don’t forget to get on the waitlist before you get there because it can be an hour plus wait on weekends.< /text>< resp>
{'time': 1573573215788, 'text': "Deborah, brunch on the patio isn't complete without a bloody mary and eggs Benedict. And the longer wait must be a sign that others have caught on just like you, so beat the rush back here as soon as you can. -Warren R., Owner"}<//resp>

Great place to sit and hang out after work. Big terrace with umbrellas but also heat lamps they set up as the evening wears on. They don’t have a full liquor license, so I wish I’d gone for one of their great looking beers and skipped the cocktail. They said they make their cocktails with some weird wine concoction, but it was mostly weak and watery. My friend and I each tried a burger. Mine was definitely not medium, but it was otherwise good. It was loaded up with mayo, okay aioli, and I can’t understand why no one puts that in the menu, but I managed to wipe it off. They have a few fry options, the garlic and herb was good, and the curry were solid. The service was friendly and helpful and not rushed. They have a nice bike rack outside. There’s only one bathroom total, which is crazy.</Review>

Really like the food and vibe of this place. Got the Impossible Burger last time I was there and loved it. Great for vegetarian options, and great for big and small groups. They have outdoor seating (which was under construction when I was there) and it's a convenient few steps away from Lake Merritt.< /text>

Very good brunch spot. Gets super busy and full but if you best the crowds it nice to sit on thepatio and have the grapefruit mimosas. We tried the garbage bread with meat which was really good. We also tried the chicken with gravy biscuits and eggs, not the best biscuits- a little dry, and not the most flavourful gravy but the potatoes were excellent.<//review>

The turkey mini burgers are amazing and they had vegan options for my brother. The place is cute and the staff is nice. Plus they have jukebox with a ton of music. 4 bucks paid for music for the entire time we were there. Parking sucks but totally worth it. Definitely going back. :)< /review>

Solid happy hour menu with vegetarian options.  Great outdoor seating (bring a coat because it can get chill!) and indoor seating is sparse but comfortable when you can get a seat! The rotating beer menu is always clutch too. Be prepared for babies and kids running around.< /review>

Friendly atmosphere, sat in the patio looking out on to Lake Merritt. Ordered the wings and Mac 'n cheese and a couple of drinks. The wings were pretty small and  dry, the bbq sauce was good, Mac 'n cheese were bland and not really cheesy. So I would say for atmosphere and drinks, this could be the place.< /text>

The outdoor patio is beautiful and sunny, and service extremely friendly. I found the vegetarian options a bit limited.<//Review>

The outside patio is beautiful, love the scene. The bottomless mimosas were good, the drink server kept our glasses full & our food server was cool. The hostess, Fernanda, was a little rude. I ordered the chilaquiles which was ok but I would not recommend it. Overall, nice atmosphere and fun place to try. If I go back, it's going to be for the atmosphere & drinks!<//review>

Got there and was told they were between brunch and dinner and had to wait 30 min. Ok, we can drink and wait. Took the waiter 10 minutes to bring us water, 20 to bring us our drinks. So we ask if we could order the since 30 minutes had passed,  he said sure he would be back to take our order. 15 minutes later we had to flag another waiter to get more water and place our order. She leaves, and the other waiter comes over 10 minutes later to take our order. At this point is almost an hour with just two glasses of water. We left.  AVOID THIS PLACE!< /Review>

Portal is a cute little restaurant next to the lake in Downtown Oakland. They have a dish called the garbage bread that comes with a marinara and pesto sauce that was amazing. I can't stop thinking about it. They also have a great selection of craft beers. Prices are decent and I ended up spending about $30 for my food. I did order a french toast dish that was very delicious. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area.< /Text>

I really enjoyed this place. Upon arrival it was packed and there was a wait, but it wasn’t too long where we would have decided to go somewhere else. Make sure that you and your WHOLE party are by the host’s stand when they call your name or they will give your table away. We sat in the back patio area, where it has long picnic tables & family style seating. If you want private seating then I would suggest to sit inside or find another venue.  Luckily the company next to us were really pleasant. It was a nice view of the lake and is greatly shaded. Service, food and atmosphere were all around good.<//text>

Nice, uncomplicated, unpretentious space, with wonderful outdoor seating looking at the Lake.  The food was yummy. The drinks and options were solid. The service was attentive, happy, kind, and excited, with ownership of their job.  The management cared deeply, was friendly, and fun.  Diverse mix of guests, all respectful and kind.

This is precisely what becomes of a great concept with wonderful management and great staff. Go figure.  In fact... just go.   Great spot!<//text>

A nice place for brunch. It gets pretty packed because of the bottomless mimosas and outdoor seating. A decent beer selection too.<//Review>

This place was underwhelming. $40 for a mediocre brunch that I had to wait for 2 hours to be seated. There are much better places in the Bay Area, in my opinion. Also, there is only 1 restroom for a place full of people drowning themselves in mimosas.< /Review>

Great cozy place to enjoy some very good food and craft beers. They've also got a really nice patio/deck that can handle big crowds. Great staff too! Adam Amler is usually working the bar when I'm there. He really knows the various brewery choices on tap, good menu pairings and will always keep you happy.<//review>

Nice microbrew selection for beer enthusiasts, a tasty burger, thin cut fries, fresh salads, and lots of appetizers to choose from in a cozy environment with a couple of TVs for sports fans. The back patio with a Lake Merritt view completes the scene for both brunch and happy hour revelers.<//Review>

Great beer selection, good food, and an amazing patio. My fav things here are the crispy brussel sprouts and the fried chicken sliders. Sometimes they even have live music out on the patio, which is really nice. Staff is always super friendly. Only downside is the single restroom but that's about it!</text>

Delicious food, awesome beer selection, amazing service and an all around great, friendly vibe. Definitely recommend sitting in the patio and enjoying the view of Lake Merritt if weather permits. I love everything I've tried here, but if it's your first time, treat yourself to the garbage bread!</review>

I love this place. I came on New Year's Day with some friends and fell in love with the awesome service and the diverse crowd. Though it isn't for everyone, I think it is pretty cool that you are seated at a table with other parties. It is a pretty cool way to meet new people while having an amazing breakfast.<//review>

<review>We go here for brunch on the weekends. Prices are reasonable and they have a diverse selection of alcohol.  We like to get their endless mimosas which are better than we can make at home.  Their plates are on the small end but cheap. I get their biscuits and gravy, and portal plate.  They're a great piece of Oakland so check them out.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I tried to get on the waitlist, it took some tracking down of people through the server on the patio who was very nice and told the hostess I (solo) wanted to be in the que. She didn’t even make eye contact with me while she shot back very stressed at the server that “she wasn’t adding adding anymore people to the list right now”. The server replied “not even for 1?” Not really a great way to treat potential customers, you don’t have to worry about me or my friends coming back to experience the unprofessionalism here.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Worth the wait. Best brunch spot in Oakland.  Great drinks, the bloody mary aka Mr. PICKLES was so good. Eggs Benedict on fried polenta with bacon was amazing. Great staff.

Nothing like starting off your birthday was a birthday brunch and good company! I've been meaning to checkout Portal for a while and this was the perfect opportunity.
I was with a couple of friends, so we had our name on the Yelp Waitlist and waited roughly 15-20 minutes for a table. The outside seating is way nicer than the inside. It actually seems like a whole different restaurant and vibe. Brunch outside is even better!
We started off with a Pitcher of Grapefruit Mimosa (~$30). My friend and I were torn between getting a sweet or savory dish...so we got both! We shared the Stuffed Challah French Toast (~$14) and GCCB (~$15).
The Grapefruit Mimosa was super refreshing and tasted great. My one complaint was that it needs to be more chilled. Especially being that we sat outside, after a short amount of time, the mimosa started to get room temperature/borderline warm since it was a hot day.
The Stuffed Challah French Toast was great! It's super soft on the inside and a little crisp on the outside. The stuffing was delicious and overall, it wasn't overly sweet. I liked the fresh berries on top.
The GCCB was the real winner here! It was fried chicken on a buttery biscuit topped with mushroom gravy. It's also served with 2 eggs (any style, we got sunnyside) and deliciously crispy and soft potatoes. The potatoes were oddly addicting and the fried chicken was cooked well. They put a solid amount of gravy. It wasn't doused in gravy nor was it scarce. It was just right!
All in all, Portal is a solid brunch spot in the Oakland area. It's a short walk away from Lake Merritt which is very beautiful in the Summer. If you haven't been here yet, I recommend swinging by for a super satisfying brunch!< /Text>

Went here for late evening drinks and dinner with a group of friends and had a great experience. There is minimal indoor seating so if that's your cup of tea be prepared to wait. If you don't mind sitting outside (there are heaters and if your extra nice they may even provide you and your dining companions with blankets) just take a seat and order the delicious "Garbage Bread". My friends and I ordered the vegetarian option and were very pleased!
Overall great place, great service great food, great atmosphere.<//Text>

We have been to portal in the past for dinner and were pretty satisfied so we decided to visit for brunch on a saturday. It was very crowded which is what we expected but the food wasn't as great as we thought it would be. My meal was completely forgotten (we were in a group of 3) while the rest of the meals were served. And everyone at the table wasn't very satisfied with the flavor and a lot of it was burnt. They do a good job of filling your drinks up if you get the bottomless. The patio is pretty but their other location Philomena seems to have a lot higher quality meals and better options all around.< /Text>

Been here three times, it’s a little like a zoo with badly behaved kids. Tonight I saw a “parent” changing their baby’s diaper ON THE PATIO! Where I was EATING. Wait staff was there (it took like 5 minutes) and did nothing.

Menu seems to change a lot, and there is something a bit off every time I have gone. The food was too cold or so different than the last time, or just eh.< /Text>

Not really worth the hype.
At all.
They're flies constantly buzzing around the semi-outdoor kitchen, and little snowflakes of pollen constantly raining down in the outdoor dining area. The umbrellas helped, but only so much in the breeze. X.x
The flies were a tad uncomfortable to see, and it did make me question the sanitation, but the plates that kept coming out looked gorgeous, so I shrugged it off.
Even though we had a reservation, we still waited 15 minutes to be seated, watching at least 2 other walk-in couples get seated at the bar in front us.  How rude!
When we finally did get seated, we sat in the patio area. With the pollen snow aside, it was cozy enough-- there were long, picnic style tables & benches that were pretty sturdy... Would have been completely cosy if my husband & I weren't sharing the long table with half-dozen college age guys ... Not exactly the environment for a quiet date... X.x
I forgot to bring my ID, so indulging in a drink was out of the question. The staff was pretty strict, so my Husband allowed me a few sips of his 'Mr. Pickle' cocktail, which was nicely flavored.
My husband's steak and eggs were out of this world -- in the bites that he shared, the steak was cooked to perfection!

I ordered the Chileqiles with Carne Asada...
Compared to my husband's steak, the Carne was a complete joke.  It was literally cooked up ground beef -- the gritty texture was a dead giveaway.

When I doused the plate with all the included condiments, I almost forgot about the tasteless impostor Asada--  medley of crunchy tortilla chips & mushy scrambled eggs was pleasant enough. But for a $20 value, I was expecting wAy more from the meat... >.<

This isn't the place for a cosy, well-made brunch .. It's more for gatherings, and for simply-cooked food...

And inattentive staff.<//review>

Delicious food that I found creative in my culinary experience. Got the goat cheese and beat salad. But everything on the menu is good I heard. The desserts looked amazing. The service was really friendly and patient. I keep going back for the atmosphere- relaxing, huge outdoor seating area & beer gardeny feel. Indoor seating is polished and welcoming.<//text>

Nice service 👌...good food in general. However I got the chilaquiles with carne asada and the meat just didn't have any special taste for the extra $6. Also the chilaquiles although had flavor didn't have enough spiciness imo. We also waited like 45 min for our food which was not cool at all but I think our waitor felt bad and gave me an extra mimosa. I'd go back but I'd definitely order something different.<//Text>

I really wanted to go here and like this place but the wait staff was rediculously rude.

I arrived here on a busy Sunday, the person at the counter asked for a name party size, and rudely mentioned it was 30-45 min wait. Being a lovely day I said we'd wait and they said they would text me.

We waited more than an hour till we found somewhere else, and we never got a response or anything from this place.

I don't care how amazing your French toast is (it looked really good), if you can't respond to people you want to give you money for food then you ought to revise your business model.< /Text>

Came for dinner on a Saturday night.  Great patio seating with a view of Lake Merritt. Beer selection was expansive and our waitress gave some useful suggestions. The double IPA was delish.  Our salads were just so-so. I had the pork belly and thought it was a bit bland. Will be back to try more of the menu.<//text>

<Review>Brunch places are all kind of the same to me now and this one is doesn't really stand out. The patio is nice but everything is loud and trying so desperately to be hip that all I can concentrate on is how completely average the food is. But that's what brunch is for, right?<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I come here pretty often because it's literally down the street. The food is pretty good but I wouldn't say it's anything more than just that. Service is great and the staff is friendly and you can tell that they work hard.

Came here once for bottomless mimosas on a nice day and had the patio seating. Instead of waiting for people to finish their mimosas before giving out more, the waiter comes every five or so minutes with a fresh pitcher and tops everyone off!  Definitely worth it!

My only complaint is that sometimes the food takes a little long to arrive. I've ordered garbage bread there twice, the first time it came WAY AFTER everyone got their food so barely anyone ate any and the second time it never showed up and the waiter had to apologize and remove it from our bill.</text><Resp>None<//Resp><pics>None</pics>< gmapID>

<text>The wait for brunch on a sunday was about a hour. Typical for bay area brunch, but what was awesome was the bottomless mimosas while we waited in their cute little patio area.  Someone got their "Mr. Pickle" bloody mary and that was super good too.  Once we got our table outside the food was quick and satisfying, though nothing that blew our minds, just good food.  We did have a view of the lake the whole time which was pretty awesome. Ill be back.< /text>< Name>

< Review>
Great service, excellent California beer, and good grub-- gem of the Eastlake side! Garbage bread is the fave of locals, but I'm all about the bottomless mimosas and Portal Benedict during weekend brunch. The excruciating wait is numbed by going back to the waiting area in the back and gettin'  ya drink on before being seated.

Nights at the bar are also grooovay.  Like I said, beautiful staff.< /Review>

Brunch here was great! Good coffee and tempeh scramble with goat cheese and potatoes. The chilaquiles looked divine too, but someone else at the table got them. I love the community style tables outside where you can be in the sun and share some stories with strangers.<//review>

Delicious gastro pub. Good beer selections. Their burger is decadent. Also recommend the garbage bread (a sort of calzone) and quinoa sliders. Brunch menu is tasty, though perhaps for the bay area somewhat plain, and often there's a long (sometimes an hour!) wait for a table. Service is usually friendly, attentive, and quick. The outside seating consists of long wooden benches, which seat up to 10 or more people; often multiple parties share a bench. Nice views of the lake.< /text>

I was hangry after movin a bud to Oakland, he asked the neighbors and Portal was recommended by all. GCCB was so delish dude. Cranberry mimosas to top it off. Even convinced my Bougie Marin bud that East Bay has some righteous things to offer.< /Text>

Cute brunch place by Lake Merritt!

I came here for a birthday brunch on Sunday and it was pretty packed. They have outdoor seating which is nice on a beautiful day. But it does get really really hot. I was sweating by the end of our brunch. The seating outside provides shade but not enough to cover you from the hot sun so dress lightly! They have bottomless mimosas during brunch :D and various beers on tap, so that can help you cool down!

I loved our waiter, Melvin! He was so awesome and he really made us feel at home. He also gave excellent recommendations for our group and kept us entertained. Definitely the service here was superb.

The Food:

Chilaquiles: I don't get this dish often, and this probably the second time I've had it. It was pretty good! I don't really have anything to compare it to but I did enjoy it. I thought the dish had good flavor but the chips were a little too soggy. I felt like the description of the dish on the menu was more appetizing than the dish itself. I don't know if I would get this again, it was good to try once.

Corned beef hash with 2 eggs any style: in the words of our waiter, "it is on point." Indeed it was, one of the best corned beef hash I've had. I really enjoyed it. He also recommended I got my eggs poached, which I did, and it was absolutely fantastic! The corned beef wasn't too salty and the potatoes balanced the dish, I would definitely come back again for this dish.

Overall, I thought this place was adorable. I would probably request to sit inside this time to avoid the heat. Perfect place to eat and then take a stroll around the lake :)<//Text>

Pros:
- GARBAGE BREAD (like a super classy calzone with chimichurri dipping sauce)
- brussels sprouts (soft with crispy outer leaves; slight sweet teriyaki flavor)
- cocktails are made with soju instead of vodka (I don't see this done often)
- quick service INDOORS (outdoors is a different story haha)
- friendly staff
- cool interior design/decor
- beautiful view from outdoors patio
- not difficult to find street parking (make sure you check street signs though!)

Cons:
- horrible service on outdoors patio (likely due to communal seat-yourself tables)
- chicken was juicy but bland in flavor
- ribs were smothered in a delicious sauce but were slightly dry/overcooked

Bottom line: Portal offers a great twist on classic American food. The garbage bread is a MUST TRY but I recommend that you sit indoors.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It's nice, hipsteron, the food looks nice but it tastes average. Excellent service. You sit on the beach, if you go on the weekend you have to queue to enter.
