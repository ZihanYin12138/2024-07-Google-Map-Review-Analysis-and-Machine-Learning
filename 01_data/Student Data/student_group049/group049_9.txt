French pastries with an Asian style. If you're expecting a true French style bakery that is not what you will get here. However, this doesn't mean the pastries are bad, far from it. They are quiet tasty.

The sandwiches are meh. The bread isn't quite what I would expect of a bakery. The pastries are really good though.< /review>

Definitely not impressed at all with Paris baguette. I decided to pick up a pastry at 7:15 AM this morning and evidently my conversation with one of the supervisors has gone to deaf ear. They only had about half or less than half of what they have to offer. I was told in the past by one of their staff to come by at 10 AM when everything is out for display. I guess I will just have to go to one of their competitors for my morning pastry breakfast.￼</Text>

I ordered cake for my sister's b'day from this store yesterday; I paid for it sitting in a different country and everything seemed fine. But eventually, the delivery person never delivered the cake which was not anyone's fault, but when called the store, the employee was super rude, asking they can't track the order neither would they deliver another one; she was not ready to help at all and even the manager was not helpful. Then I contacted the delivery company and they asked the place to make a new cake and the delivery company had it done. Also, the store gave refund, they charged me $50 for cake but didn't refund me full amount. This was ridiculous! Bday was totally ruined by the ruckus created.< /Text>

In short, a dining out disaster. When taking our order the manger or owner broke off mid sentence to answer the phone and left us standing there for awhile. Then finally another employee took over she had no idea if they had a requested item in store, and suggested we go back to look for an alternative on one their open shelves. The only way for us to do that was to ignore social distancing guidelines and walk directly passed several people in line. When we replied that it wasn't an option she just stood back and let the owner deal with us. The outside seating was also quite dirty. Luckily, one other employee took care of that. Needless to say we have no intention of coming back with such low level of service.</Review>

I can’t help but to say that when I first pulled into the parking lot as a customer I simply couldn’t help but to wow moment how from the outside you can see it’s so clean and so cozy and warm effect that I got . And as I approached the doors how everything stood out to me and made me even more so inviting to submit my job application with the Owner Navi’s who is my boss . Getting hired during the pandemic is a Blessing and Honor . In spite of the rules and county guidelines as I reside in Turlock Ca but employee at the Paris Baguette in Pleasanton CA. I must say I’m proud and honored to be a part of this family of the Paris Baguette with Navid & Annie and everyone there . Can’t wait to be there again to work You all are missed and loved by me Geetangaly Prasad Rosales “Angelina” in my eyes this location has 10 thousand stars by me!!!!!!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1612997787275, 'text': 'Thank you for all of the work you do!'}<//Response><gmapID>0x808fe950f685a6d1:0x976189c84f77758a< /gmapID></record>

First time there. Two of the tongs were dirty but it's probably due to someone putting them back. The cream puffs were delicious. The croissant donut was pretty good. I'd like to try their cakes. Over all pretty good. I'll be going back for sure 👍</review>

Ruined my Mother’s Day delivery. Door Dash arrived to pick up the order and was informed that none of the items in the order were available in store. The Door Dash driver texted me to get a refund. That was the first that I heard that there was an issue with the order at 5:29pm, for a 5:30pm delivery. I kept getting notifications from both Door Dash and Paris Baguette/Olo that my order had been delivered successfully-untrue. Called Paris Baguette, they informed me that only one of the items on the order was available and I could have it picked up. With my Door Dash order canceled, that wasn’t an option anymore. I wasn’t able to get anything to my mom on this mother’s day due to complete mishandling primarily by Paris Baguette and in part by Door Dash. I love this place ordinarily, but this experience has put a total damper on my opinion of them.</Review>

Place is awesome has a great play Park nice big field basketball courts clean bathrooms everything here would be perfect clean and kept up if it wasn't for the kid slide.A giant crack  and they tried to putty on top of the crack scratched across my son's chest because the putty's cracking off they're not maintaining the plastic Park pieces very well. make sure you check the slides before your kids go down< /review>

<Review>It is a good park primarily for the kids in the area to play basketball at the court and ride their bikes.  It is small as parks go and there are more relaxing parks like Heritage Lake nearby if that is your goal.  If you are looking for a spot to let the kids get some energy out this seems to be the main draw here for the nearby residents.  There are a few exercise items, benches, and a covered gazebo.  There are plaques calling it Rancho Ramona park but the biggest and most visible sign calls this John V. Denver park to help clear up any confusion finding it< /Review><Time>1598471790657< /Time>< rating>

Although it's brand new there were a quite a few shady people hanging around smoking. When approached and asked if they could not smoke next to the playground rude comments ensued. Not worth it when there are other options<//review>

Just stopped by this morning. I like how they installed a new bathroom. The park is fine, my only issue is all the trash in the playground. Foam cups ripped everywhere,  ripped clothes left behind, plastic knives and forks scattered on the floor. It's disgusting and prob won't be coming back because lazy people can't pick up their own trash. Ps: There are trash cans everywhere so no excuse.< /text>

They recently installed a pretty decent little bathroom, which has been well maintained. There are two covered picnic areas, a basketball court, volleyball area, playground equipment, a small field area, and BBQ equipment.<//Review>

This is your standard neighborhood park. That said, it's what you make of it. It has basketball courts, a large grass area, and a playground for the kids. There are a couple of covered gazebo areas with picnic tables. If you want to have a good time, this is a blank slate waiting for you to do something with it.< /Review>

Pretty good and cheap haircut place. The ladies were friendly most of the time hehe. The place is not bad especially for the price but usually there's quite a waiting line to be assisted.</Review>

<text>These people don't waste your time. It's affordable but the hair stylists here do above and beyond work. I've had a different person cut my hair each time and I haven't had a bad haircut yet. They speak mostly Chinese and English (English fluently). It's usually busy on weekends and after school hours so if you don't want to wait go in the morning! It's very open and the floor is clean. They're not trying to hide anything. If you want a an affordable haircut then Cool Cuts is your place!< /text>< UserId.>

<Text>$8 cheap haircuts are never good, right? Wrong!! I used to go to a place where they charged me $40 for a haircut!!  This place is my new-found place for haircuts from now on. They only do haircuts, nothing fancy.  Fast and easy. Never have to wait. Just walk in during business hours, sign in, and one of the experienced ladies will work on your hair. Adults and kids.  They know what they're doing. I love the results so far. Will be going back again.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Quality is hit or miss. Sometimes it’s ok, sometimes it’s ruined. Today is one of those days that is ruined. I will be hiding in the closet for the next few weeks 🤦

Tips: Make sure you are adamant about what you wants, keep telling them what to do and keep watching over them. Don’t let them rush you!

Will try again next time and hopefully they can change my mind.< /Text></record>

Honestly a really good place for cheap hair cuts. I go here frequently. Usually there are a few ladies that cut your hair generally consistently, not always but good enough. Last visit had a male who I assume was a new employee, was a bit worried because I haven't gotten a cut from him before. However, it turned out great! Would extremely recommend them, great for price with friendly staff.</Text>

I opt for a neat, classic cut but I've seen Jean cut some  extreme fades for other happy customers. Very skillful, hardly needs the clipper guards. They cut women's styles for a few dollars more. My wife likes their no-fuss, no BS/gossip style.</review></record>

Absolutely the lowest price in Southern California. Possibly the best cut as well. Very friendly staff. I usually pay them double because they're literally half the price . Seriously!< /review>

I was suggested by my family to come here.  Excellent haircut for only $8.  Barber Jean(Jing) has been cutting my family's hair for almost 10 years in a different place in Alhambra.  Now she has a new business in Temple City which is beautiful, clean and family friendly.<//Review>

Literally one of my favorite stores. I love hiking and camping and this store has everything you need. I normally get a lot on sale to save some money. If you sign up for their $20 membership there are a lot of perks. I also got fitted here for running shoes and I loved how hands on the store associates are. They were very informative and I love my Brooks.< /Review>

Came in and didn’t know the entrance was our back,  was told entrance was thru the back. So went around and man they have some really cool bikes!! Not too expensive, you can still get a workout in. They have some that go 20mph and some faster ones that clock in at 28. But wear a helmet! Check them out Casey neistat  Bought his little electric Wagon from this spot!< /Text>

< Review>
I just realized I never gave a review to this place. Better late than never. Here's my review.

After shopping around, I bought my first electric bicycle here. They help me out and maintain my bicycle. They offer good prices and good monthly payments plans here.

Unfortunately, they end up got a bad brand bicycle that I bought. it was Juiced. Don't buy it. They end up stop selling it and they did their best to help me with my bicycle and the manufacture.

Anyway, 2 years past and I figured it's time to get another another electric bicycle. I was debating if I should shop around again or should I go back and get another electric bicycle from them?

Since they help me allot and service my bicycle on time, I decided to get an electric bicycle from them again because I may not get the same customer service and have my bicycle fixed on time at other places.

This time I decided to get E-Lux. This electric bicycle is very good and I am very happy with it. I didn't have that much problems with it at all. I am very happy with it.

I will recommend getting an electric bicycle from them. After you get your electric bicycle, they will continue giving you good service and low prices there.<//Review>

Definitely my go-to bike shop for life! They have a fantastic selection and variety of electric bikes and regular bikes. You can test drive the bikes before making your decision, which is really helpful for people like me who like to be more hands on.
Their staff is helpful and knowledgeable, sometimes they get busy but they really do go the extra mile in helping find the right fit for my activity level and size. Their customer service is how it should be- personal and accommodating. I highly recommend Bike Attack for any cycling needs!< /Review>

LOVE! These guys are awesome, so helpful and kind. Very obviously-genuinely there to help and not just to make a buck. I walked in with a stripped bike :/ and Martin put me on the back of his electric bike and rode me down to the other shop as Sal rode his bike carrying mine over his shoulder! I've always come here to get my tires checked etc and everyone is always of service and puts a smile on my face :)</Text>

I love this place! The guys that run the shop are super friendly and professional. The selection is top-of-the-line and the pricing is very competitive. Not only did I buy a new bike here but brought an older one in for service and I couldn't be happier with the results or the price.

As a relatively new e-bike rider I must say that I in no way ever felt I had been upsold or price-gouged, in fact, I had quite the opposite experience. The sales team helped me pick the right bike for my needs, were flexible and fair with pricing and have been phenomenal with routine maintenance and upkeep of the bike I purchased in-store.

Highly recommend!< /Text>

Awesome shop with great people! A nice change from a typical sales shop. Good to know they are always there for their customers. It took me 3 days and 50 questions to make up my mind, and never felt any pressure from any one of the employees! It's rare in this money hungry town!</Review>

< review>
I bought a touring bike from Bike Attack to go directly on tour. Worst experience I have ever had with mechanics. I bought a surly disc trucker, pannier racks, helmet and a couple of other items.
My issues were:
1) They fitted racks which under load, stopped the front disc brake working. This could have been a fatality. They never apologized for their behavior, and although they refunded money from the racks, I still am angry about this incompetence.
2) They cross threaded the drive side pedal. Not really a problem as I put it on, but since then it was difficult to put the pedal on, finally resulting in the threads failing whilst on a ride resulting in a long walk, and a train ride followed by another walk. And the cost of a new crankset. Which leads me on to...
3) The drive side crank was overtightened so much that it broke my Park Tools crank puller!
The sales guy I dealt with was great, and the price was reasonable, but the mechanics were a disgrace, and the dealings that I had with them after discovering the problems were atrocious.< /review>

<review>This place is excellent! They offered very competitive prices on a great bike, made sure that the bike fit all my needs, weren't pushy on the sale at all, and were extremely friendly throughout the entire process. I would recommend this bike store to anyone in the LA area. If they don't have the bike you're looking for in stock, they have great relationships with a number of vendors to get you a bike ASAP. Keep up the good work Bike Attack!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I was in the market to replace my old Honda scooter with a greener e-bike option. I had tested another bike at a different store, and I was leaning that way, but then I thought I'd stop in Bike Attack Electric just to check things out. Boy, am I glad I did. Ericson is friendly, helpful, and really knowledgeable about e-bikes, and he introduced me to a bike that perfectly meets my needs without breaking the bank. I bought a Surface 604 Colt Electric and a Torch T2 helmet, and I'm super stoked. The store location is perfect for testing out e-bikes because there's a pretty intimidating hill right around the corner. I'm so glad I found this store!< /Text>< user_name>

When I was looking for my perfect bike, I searched all over the internet and all over town.. Finally, I stopped in Bike Attack, and within the first 15 minutes of being there, I was out the door with my new perfect bike. They had an excellent selection, awesome staff and no pressure atmosphere. When I bought it, they told me, "If anything goes wrong with it, bring it in and we'll take care of it for you". Recently, I had a problem with my breaks, so I stopped back to see if they could fix it...within 15 minutes again, they replaced the part and I was on my way! Definitely worth making this your permanent bike shop!< /review>

<text>I'm from the Bay Area and purchased a surface 604 shred to have shipped up here as I was unable to find any local shops that carried it. Though it didn't say so on the site at time of order, they were out of stock of the 14 amp/hr battery upgrade and offered a few recovery options including throwing in a second 10 amp/hr. battery which was a great deal and appreciated on my end.

The bike came within a week of ordering and while it was packed wonderfully, UPS must've mishandled because there was a hole torn in the corner of the box. While there was no damage to the bike, I am guessing that a few components fell out because I ended up missing the keys for the battery lock assembly.

I immediately called and they were unable to locate the key at their shop but went out of their way to call Surface 604 and had them ship me a new lock assembly expedited. They even walked me through the install when it came.

Overall great bike and very great customer service experience.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Was just checking out that place at Santa Monica (Bike Attack Electric) and ended up with a cool new 'all-weather-all terrain bicycle'.  Because I had some very special requirements the owner took me with his truck to his other shop just 10 minutes away (Bike Attack @Playa Vista). He had some great ideas and deep experience  to make my customized bike the best bicycle I every bought. Great Service! Deep Knowledge! Fair price! If you need to maintain your bike or a repair ... ask for Dimitri at Playa Vista Shop. Those guys rocks</Review>

<text>Fantastic customer service! Thanks to Marcus and Martin for helping me pick out my Surface 604 (Colt). These guys know exactly what they are talking about and will give you the "low down" on electric bikes, whether you are looking for a commuter bike or something to "tool around" on the weekends. In fact, Marcus met me at 6AM to deliver the bike to make sure I made my international flight at LAX that same morning - this is unheard of!

I've been using the bike for about a week now and it's exactly what I need. In fact, sometimes I wish the commute was just a bit longer so that I could spend more time on it.

Thanks again for your help guys!</text>< pics>

Nice shop - friendly staff & a good range of bikes.
I came in here with a bike that had suffered a brake issue & I didn't have a 10mm wrench to fix it.  They loaned me what I needed and were happy to help.
Cheers!</review>

I have looked for a long time for a store that addresses the needs to serious mountain bikers, and found it right here. Not only the staff is knowledgeable on their products and price options, they can also get you whatever you want, at a competitive price. I have never established any kind of personal connection with other bike stores in the area, some of which I bought up to three bikes from...whereas B.A. always greets a returning customer in a friendly and attentive manner. And if you are interested in boutique-style preparation and attention to detail, there just isn't any other place, not to mention the mix of high-end bikes with very affordable ones, albeit in a small space. Location is perfect when on the go to a ride, plenty of parking in the lot if needed, and a great coffee house across the street while you wait. :-)< /review>

<Review>Just wanted to give a big thanks to Ericson at Bike Attack Electric. I have not seen a smile on my husband's face like he had after coming home from his first ride on his new Bulls electric mountain bike, in a long time!!  It has already become his new "therapy."  After all he has been through, which has limited his legs physically, to see him this happy is truly a blessing.  Ericson and his crew know how to put smiles on people's faces!! I would recommend this place to everyone!! FYI He has been a mainstay in Venice and Santa Monica for over 20 years now!!<//Review><user>106705087902366725624<//user>< GmapID>

<Review>I bought my Blix Aveny at Bike Attack Electric last week and I couldn’t be happier! They gave me awesome deal since I am a returning customer at their Playa Vista shop, and they even delivered the bike for free! Since I’m new to electric bikes I had a lot of questions and they helped me with a lot of patience. As they are a busy store, I greatly appreciate the the customer care! Thanks Bike Attack Team! You rock!< /Review>< pics>

I have been looking for a minivelo type of bicycle for a while now. I liked the Bruno and Bianchi models but they are only sold in Asia and importing one is just not practical. I have tested the Tokyo Bike version and it’s nice and beautiful but it is heavy with only 7 speed. I kept searching and found a bike company named Biria that has their own minivelo model. I contacted several Biria dealer and Bike Attack was the only store to actually have one in their store. I contacted them and they mentioned that they will give me a deal if I checked it out. Anyway, I dropped by their store to see if I will like the bicycle and not totally planning on buying it - I still wanted to try several models. When I arrived at the store, I was greeted by a friend;y guy behind the counter and he asked if he can help. I said that I heard that they have minivelo in the store and he pointed up and said something like ‘we have that one’.  I asked how much and he said $899 but he can give it to me for $599. I was stunned specially since I knew they were selling the bike for $930 on their website. They really did gave me a deal. A really great one at that! Needless to say, I was a happy camper and my Christmas turned out very special indeed. This is a great store that specializes in electric bikes but they do sell a few conventional bikes as well. The service is friendly and laid back. I totally recommend this place if you are looking for a new ride.</review>

<Time>1505668437121</Time><text>Stromer dream turned to nightmare.

Purchased a Stromer ST2 on July 14, 2017 as a birthday gift to myself.  My dream bike!

On July 27, in the middle of a ride, I experienced tension or friction several times that prevented the bike from rolling forward at a normal clip. At the time I purchased my bike, I also ordered a front suspension fork, and they called me to say it had arrived so when I dropped it off on July 29, I also asked them to also address the tension problem.

Picked my bike up on August 2 and the installed fork looked great and the owner told me the bike was fixed. However, I experienced the same friction problem shortly afterwards. In addition, now the front and rear lights would not turn off using the toggle switch.

On August 8, I called Joel at Stromer in San Diego to see if he could assist with the light issue but he could not connect to my bike as T-Mobile signal was not adequate.  He suggested disconnecting the light wiring to turn the front light off until I could call back from an area with better service.

On August 18th, I experienced the friction problem again and recorded the sound with my phone.

Took the bike in again to Bike Attack on August 27 where I showed them the recording.   Frank looked at it and called up Joel again.  Joel said he would send a new controller.  Got a call on September 2nd saying the controller was in and could I bring my bike in.  As I was on vacation in Seattle, I  brought the bike in on September 9 and got it back on the 10th.  The light issue is still not resolved and now, with the new controller, experiencing no e-assistance at all after the initial start up crank of the bike.

Taking my bike in again today to ask for a new bike and the saga continues...< /text>< GmapID>

Bike Attack is my local bike shop and I have nothing to complain. They are friendly and do all minor repairs like adjusting gears and brakes and fixing flats on the spot. They carry nice brands like Linus, Bianchi, Intense and Kona and have a lot of bikes in stock or can order it for you within days.
I bought my Bianchi Impulso 105 there some months ago, got a 10% discount and I'm happy with the purchase, the price and the service.<//review>

Worse nail place I have been to. 1hr waiting and 1.5hr for a Gel Manicure. They have CDC guidelines but don’t do temperature check or sanitize the area after each customer. No social distancing.<//Review>

I've been going here for years,  but they have gotten very careless over the years.  I always bring my own nails tools because they are not clean at all.  I have never seen them use the disinfectant solution.  They simply spray their tools with alcohol.</Review>

HORRIBLE !! A complete bad job on my nails. Mini is super rude and unprofessional. Charger me $57
I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY! It was a basic fill that took 2 hours to get done. Disappointed and unsatisfied. Won’t recommend at all.

<Text>I am not one to leave a review anywhere, but girl this nail salon! They had me and my mom waiting for over an hr, and then they had us take a seat in a regular foldable chair. Girl they had those fancy electrical chairs just as decorations apparently. For me that was not a dealbreaker honestly. What had me disappointed and dissatisfied was that they did my mothers and my pedicure both under 15 min. Then they charged me and my mother totally different prices even though we had the same procedure done and same nail color. Girl if I could give them 0 stars I would.<//Text>< pics>

<text>The service was bad. My nails looked horrible and the coffin shape was.... not a coffin shape. I asked for manicure and the only thing I got was lotion in my hand. They just squeezed a drop of lotion on my hand and told me I was done. Told me it was $28 for the horrible job. I didnt have cash. They told me it was a $1 charge on the card, I said ok. I tried tipping $5 but the guy on the front desk motioned me not to so I crossed out that $5 and wrote the total of $29. I felt bad I didn't tip but honestly she didnt deserve it. She looked like the main lady of that place. Mimi was her name and they were rushing so bad tryna take everybody that walked in thru that door. Well I check my bank account a day later and got charged $34 instead of $29 like I made it in my receipt. Wouldn't ever go back there even if it was free.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I love this place. I been going here since I was little girl to get my nails done it's family friendly. They sale snacks and drinks inside. The have a hair dresser that cuts hair, dye hair style it. I just love the talent they have with nails. A family runs it, the owner and her parents. The owner are her mom does nails or help out while her dad normally cleans. And they take nails very seriously learned that when I was young about 5 and messed up my mom nails 😂😂😂 awnd got scolded but the owner but it was funny again it's a family place. Family friendly.< /text>

I had alot of questions, and made me feel very comfortable.  The place is very clean, and well taken care of. I felt completely at ease, and was very impressed with their security system.

I CANNOT express enough of how impressed my experience has been with Cypress.
After careful review and research, I decided to go see for myself how this facility was.
I was immediately greeted by Margaret.  Let me tell you, she certainly knows her stuff! Just by asking some basic questions about my needs she was able to tell me what size unit to get. I was thinking bigger.!! We went to check the unit out.
I couldn't believe how immaculate everything was.!! I guess that's what brand new gets you!!! The
unit is perfect for my needs. Spot on, I might add.
I would give ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ if I could!!!!
Margaret gets 5 and Cypress gets the other 5 !!!</Text>

Cypress self storage is awesome! When I came in for a quote I met the managers daughter and we ran through the different unit sizes and prices. She walked me around the property and showed me two open units to see sizing and the elevator. Calling in the next day to actually get my unit i got a hold of Jason and he started my paperwork over the phone to save me time. He even stayed in office a little after office hours so I could pick up my keys after work. This place has a good family feel! Can’t wait to store my stuff here!< /review>

Directions were clear being a new customer.
Worker was very interested in my plans. Then agreed on my move in plans? Good choices!
Completed rental agreement in 10 minutes.
Paid and approved in another 5 minutes secure on line.
All Completed very quickly i was amazed how easy to rent at the Oakley CA location!
Ready to store my needed items after downsizing my life and home after retirement.
Great prices! I signed right up to secure storage locker size I needed at the Great move in special.
New Storage I watch them build storage location while I traveled down Cypress Road to Marina resort I like to use. It close and conveniently in the right location for my use.</Review><Rating>5</Rating><Name>wayne Fredrick</Name>< user_id>

<Text>Cypress Self Storage is another great facility designed from the ground up to be a vibrant addition to the community that it serves.  As someone who has visited all of the Northern CA Smart Self Storage facilities, I can say that Cypress Self Storage facility represents the same high standard the others have to offer.  The first thing that sets these facilities apart from others in the industry  is the commitment to customer satisfaction.  The facility owners strive to have each customer be extremely satisfied with their experience at the facility itself;   they also want to go beyond that by making sure each customer knows their business is very important. and appreciated.   Customers are treated with respect and warmth.  They're invited to chat with staff regarding the overall community and share what they'd want others to know is valuable about the community they live and work in.  Of course, each customer is provided with a facility tour that allows for a no-pressure selection of their unit.  All units are state-of-the-art as is the entire facility.  I've met the team that designs Smart Self Storage facilities and know that its goal is not only for each facility to provide customers with an excellent self storage product but also come away feeling respected, appreciated and happy about their decision to put their valuables in the hands of the professionals at Cypress Self Storage.</Text>< date>

<rating>5</rating><review>Cypress Self Storage is Fantastic!! Their customer service is top notch. Jason is extremely helpful. He answered ever question I had & I've never felt rushed talking to him. I was paying double for a unit half the size in San Francisco with horrible customer service. This facility is brand new & very clean. I'd feel very safe coming here after dark. I'd advise anyone who is looking for a storage facility to just give them a call & you will see for yourself.</review>< Pics>

Clean facility.  Simple process to rent a unit.  Units are  mostly drive up which makes it easy to load/unload your stuff.  Jason was very helpful and knowledgeable.  He’s also very protective of ensuring your stuff remains safe.< /Review>

<Text>This place is great easy start up for storage and easy move in. They provide use of a truck to move items to your storage unit which was so convenient considering the price you pay for rental of a truck. The staff are all pleasant and helpful. The office is clean and everyone was masked and during COVID-19 this is definitely comforting. I would strongly suggest this storage facility for all your storage needs.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Update: On my second visit to this facility I spoke with a nice woman at the front desk for awhile. During the conversation I was taken aback and completely offended when she said the “N word” during the retelling of a story about her “black son in law”. Needless to say I have not returned to the inside of the office. I also called today to ask about a service that I was told about upon move in where your allowed to use the facility truck to move your items in. I explained that I was having a home built in the new neighborhood across the street and that I would not be using the storage until closer to my closing date. I was told that it wasn’t a problem and that I would be able to use the truck. I spoke to the new manager today and he told me that I would not be able to use the truck because it is only for new renters 😒. I’m definitely indifferent about this storage facility now. I guess we’re past the honeymoon phase.

Absolutely amazing! Jaydin is so sweet and had answers to all my questions!! This storage facility has definitely set a standard!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This review grants a free lock for customers. All opinions are mine.  Initial walkthrough and onboarding was nice and quick. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.   Features for security appear good and extra cameras and verification are active.  Hours of access is 7 to 7p which is not great for me personally.  I'm sure it's fine for others. Staff is onsite during operations hours.<//review>

Jason helped guide us through the rental process and alleviated all of our concerns with leaving our ENTIRE house and ALL of our belongings in a unfamiliar environment.
But we are so glad we choose Cypress as our storage facility, its BRAND NEW and extremely clean and easy to get in and out and they also let us use their brand new moving truck to move in to the unit.
To those out there that find themselves in similar transitions with moving you understand the enormous amount of work it is and how many things you have on your list of things to do and Cypress self storage helped to eliminate a hand full of tasks from our to do list all at once which gave us breathing room to complete the rest!!!
How could anybody that's actually rented at cypress not give them 5 stars!! I would give 10 starts if it let me. i will only review company's I feel go above and beyond in customer service and satisfaction. They surpassed all expectations. Fabulous experience!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

{'time': 1600965978668, 'text': "Alondra, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. Anything other than exceptional customer service is not good enough for us. Since we are brand new, we still have a few different construction professionals (and handymen) on our site performing various jobs: Installing display shelving in our office, delivering and installing appliances in our office kitchen, hanging artwork in our office, caulking in preparation for the winter, taking photographs of our property for marketing, and more. These professionals may be in our office performing work from time-to-time, but have been instructed to NOT engage with customers. Our on-site manager, who is responsible for customers, may sometimes be out-and-about on the property and not in our office, as he regularly shows units to customers throughout the day. I'm wondering if what happened here is that you noticed one of our construction/handymen crew, and not our property manager? (Also worth noting: We only allow a minimum of customers in our office at any given time due to strict COVID protocol.) We apologize for not being there when you stopped by. Very soon here, our staff size will be increasing, so that we have even more bandwidth for the large flow of customers we are experiencing. We just recently opened for business and are ramping up. We thank everyone in the community. Alondra, if you'd like to speak with our business manager, please give us a call at (925) 625-6001. We'd like to have the opportunity to turn your experience into an extraordinary one. We greatly care! Thanks, again, and we wish you all the greatest and tremendous blessings."}<//response>

{'time': 1600883066653, 'text': "Alyson, thank you for taking the time to share your opinion. This review was written a few years ago before we even started our construction, but we wanted to take the time to respond publicly to your concern about having more self storage in the City of Oakley. A fun fact: There are more self storage facilities in the United States than McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy's combined. Why? Nearly 1 in 10 US households utilizes self storage. Given that Oakley is a quickly-growing city with an abundance of new homes, self storage is a valuable service for the community. It may seem like there are a lot of self storage facilities, but that is because there are also a lot of new families moving to the community (especially with major employers like Amazon coming to town).\n\nAt Cypress Self Storage, we are at the intersection of E. Cypress Rd. and Picasso. Many customers in our local neighborhood rely on our business for their storage needs, especially customers that live at Emerson Ranch, Delaney Park, Summerlake, and other nearby communities. Given the major railroad crossing at E. Cypress Rd. and Main St., it's a pain for customers to leave our local community because the road can get backed up, especially when they just want to quickly drop by to access their stored items. Moreover, we are just across the street from Iron House Elementary School. Busy parents can easily pull right into our facility after picking up or dropping off their children at school (of course, once school reopens). Customers benefit from storing their items close to home in their local community.\n\nAt Cypress Self Storage, we care about our local community and installed major improvements at our expense. We installed a brand new left turn lane, making it easy for members of the community to pull into our facility (or simply make a U-turn, if needed). At Cypress Self Storage, we installed substantial landscaping and spent substantial money making our facility architecturally beautiful. Our facility acts as a buffer between the railroad (and its associated noise) and the community, lowering noise. With nearly 1 in 10 US households renting a self storage unit, we are proud to be part of the community and offer our valuable service.\n\nWe realize that there are a variety of new self storage facilities in Oakley to choose from. That is great, in our opinion, because the consumer has choice and can choose the facility that is best from them. We wish all the other facilities all the best. We are proud to be one of them, and are here for everyone in the community. We wish you all the greatest, and hope this information may have changed your mind. And, if not, we still want to wish you the absolute best."}<//Resp>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>Amazing little sushi restaurant, literally a hidden gem of Palo Alto since it's not on the street front but hidden behind in an alley.
Super fresh fish and the chef delicately dresses up every single piece of nigiri keeping the flavors in mind.
The uni was one of the freshest we've had in the bay area and some of the other stars included kanpachi, Shima aji, kin medai, sake to, Umi masu and of course the toro!< /text><userid>105091844295821266148< /userid><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1lneY7Vi6ol3d_VjQclATudGoRHbTOnrsUmtY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb1ttmlWEu-KPxblZAGg5LHDGr5kRoJuhMiMTo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeNW4kPnQwRJ78iRU5K6LLGvs5WQlxqXjEl3C_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVyIQ3axtFqNYSq2FIDr8XoMOwcGZFybJzE_sH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF2fQT586uHf_4XLyTU0SLtQj6-VLKXWI3HRCv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0fMQ5qEYJv3lM-yj-o73szk627uxRGEkyC97D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLKUGhnErEbQI-RbVxvMn2a8kSyDXkj-Uywhzz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvw_h2kMRSHg2GM7iUEg5iwryeIN9naCUyRO9p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8yh0ntWhTC0BuVNOB2G6PJXnmcC0yvBHZniE-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEiBLy2uV6X5sS2vBz174G-lgexcgGaoKPI4q8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgI4WxK-fwtG2BBuWld9Sn5im0vSc_A6wAWZcn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLMpjv7tm2upX_NhTChXK0Hc9oclq_bg2IzecD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Date>

Incredible. WOW.

Authentic, fresh ingredients. It is so apparent each dish was well thought out and created with such consideration and passion.

Please come here and support this new business. I cannot say enough what a treat it is.

Come early and enjoy yourself.<//Review>

Delicious meal! Even with the local closures of indoor dining, Daigo creates a great selection of take-out dishes, beer, and excellent sake beverages. Everything was super fresh and there is clear attention to details in their recipes and presentation. Thanks! Really worth supporting this gem now! 💎<//Text>

This place is tucked away in Palo Alto and had a really delicious omakaze! My boyfriend and I each got a set with a different nigiri at the end, his wagyu and mine uni. What we both really enjoyed was how meaty each slice of fish was. They certainly didn’t skimp on their portions of sashimi. And the Hamachi shots were a great way to start the meal too! Hopefully we’ll be able to make another trip out once it’s safe to soon.<//text>

<text>Daigo had good sushi, great atmosphere, and great alcohol. All of the fish was fresh, and I enjoyed every roll. This place is more of the traditional idea of sushi. I would consider the rolls to be on the simpler side which lets the fish stand out, but that also means none of the rolls especially stood out. I would still visit if only to eat in the cute "hole-in-the-wall"-feeling restaurant.< /text>< Pics>

Overall: super fresh, super tasty (can be expensive)

FOOD: omg, wow. So good . Every piece of nigiri was absolutely amazing. We had an assortment of fish and seriously, every single piece was delicious. My favorites were the toro, uni, salmon belly. But seriously all were great. I have to say that I was very impressed by how fresh everything was and the presentation of the food was still excellent.

LOCATION/SERVICE: a little hard to find lol. It's like in an alley and I only found it because of a sidewalk sign. The restaurant was clean and had great service. People there were very friendly and on top of it. We got our food quickly.

Would recommend if looking for delicious sushi and willing to pay< /review>

This place was great! My wife and I have been to a handful of sushi places in the area and this one hit the spot! The waitress was very helpful and attentive, and overall the service was fast and excellent. We ordered several rolls and enjoyed all of them. They have a good selection of options but without being overwhelming. The presentation, freshness, and taste were great, especially for a pretty reasonable price. We'll definitely be going back. The place is small but very well decorated and clean. It's a small hidden gem.< /text>

Came in 45 minutes before closing and was denied service on a perfectly fine and busy night. While there were plenty of tables that had still yet to order, we were forced to turn around and go back home without any hesitation or hospitality. I guess there's no such thing as southern hospitality around these parts in California.</text>< response>

Super authentic and good.  This place has incredible quality sushi and while a little pricey isn't completely crazy for sushi.  The quality of their fish is really great.  I really like to start sushi with Miso soup (just a personal habit) and even that was really good.  Will definitely be back.<//Review>

High end sushi restaurant. Just four tables and a few seats at the bar. You are paying for quality fish. I recommend you let them choose for you. Drowning your sushi in soy sauce is frowned upon. The Zen of the sushi experience is in the restraint and simplicity along with the freshest ingredients.</text>

<review>This is the best sushi I’ve had in the U.S.  I lived in Japan for 4 years and ate sushi/sashimi several times/week. 2 of us split the larger omakase, Erynga tempura, miso and edamame.  The omakase is better than any of the extremely expensive places in San Francisco at 1/3 the price.  The sushi is on par with the best I’ve had in Japan.  The ambiance is good; simple light colored wood, quiet, understated, like a solid place in Japan. Service was outstanding.  Our waiter was a young guy from Japan so the manners and customs were spot on.  It’s now our go to place for great sushi.  Skip the pretentious needlessly expensive places in San Francisco.  This is the place< /review>< Pics>

We've been here multiple times, and watch time it's been consistently top-notch sushi.

The aburi saba roll (note there's ginger in it), eryngi tempura, and zuke sake toro are all you need to know. There's lots of other stuff here, but these are dishes I *assume* I'm ordering when I walk in the door.</review>

<Review>Top shelf sushi here. I'd recommend fish, but we mostly got the daily specials, which I'm not sure we'll ever see again. I'll have to go back to find out. Y'know, for science and stuff.

If you like umami, get the oyster mushroom tempura starter. Maybe even order two. We did.<//Review>< pics>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>Lots of wasted potential.

Their fish is really good and high quality. However they completely messed up the sushi rice. Seems more like Chinese rice, than the sushi rice cooked Japanese style. The rice takes  away from the sushi experience. If you just want to have Sashimi then it's probably OK.

Their Agedashi tofu was also sub par.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

The service is exceptional, but otherwise the experience is middling.  The food was average -- I'm not sure why other reviewers raced about the quality and flavor as I found everything to be more bland than flavorful.  Maybe it was an off night but I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend.</text>

<Review>Great new spot for fresh sashimi/nigiri. They have a specials list with a lot of variety. Sake was quite good and the green tea and yuzu cheesecakes were better than expected.< /Review>< time>

Just had a delicious lunch here. Excited to come back for omakase dinner. I had a spicy tuna maki roll and korokke lunch platter. Everything was very fresh. Staff is very friendly too!</text>

Pros: best sushi and sake I've had in the Bay so far, very kind and knowledgeable waiters, intimate yet casual. Cons: quite expensive (paid $85/person for a 9-piece omakase, 3-piece sashimi, a shared roll and sake, all included), ambience/chopsticks/napkins/other details do not match the price tag, may need to wait for a while (we waited for 15 min at 8:15pm). Attire smart casual. Great for a date, OK for a first date. Similar quality to Kyosho, otherwise much better than other sushi restaurants in Palo Alto (e.g. Kanpai).< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808fbbd1e15a93ed:0xc6ba7f4f29ee3bb3< /gmapID></record>

I would save your lunch money ($26 for 8 PC sashimi lunch set) for a nicer omakase meal or to try a wider variety of their sushi and specialties (hamachi shot recommended!) only offered at dinner.<//Text>< Pictures>

Finally authentic nigiri and sashimi in Palo Alto. Daigo replaces long time favorite and casual takeout spot Homma’s Brown Rice sushi with a more upscale and traditional sushiya experience.  Despite not being Japanese run, Daigo impresses with an extensive specials menu (rivals Gintei in San Bruno) and solid knife skills.  Nigiri are priced per piece which means prices can add quickly but that you can also sample a lot of variety.
Tip: order from the specials menu or choose among a variety of Omakase specials where the chef will choose.<//text>

Checked out this place on a quiet Sunday during their soft open. Second branch of a popular SF spot. Wait staff was lovely and attentive and the co-owner was so welcoming and friendly, recommending a perfectly clean tasting sake and making us feel as if we'd sat down to dinner at a friend's house (who just happens to make amazing sushi). Sashimi was delicious and fresh, flown in from Japan daily! They will add omakase and other specials eventually. Rolls were on point, good balance of filling v. rice, great flavor, and easy to fit in my mouth. Get the tamago too, it was just oozing with umami. We got comped a tasty green tea cheesecake for dessert! All in all a satisfying meal and I'm looking forward to making this my regular sushi spot.< /review>

I walked into the shop and was able to speak with one of the Artists right away. Rica is the one who helped me. I had to come back later that day since he was booked which to me, it’s a good sign. I was comfortable being there, I loved the atmosphere and music. I believe I spent about an hour there. Definitely would come back 🙃
Thank you again Rica.< /review>

Rica did my tattoo and I love it. He had a humorous attitude and did not mind me being so picky given that it was my first tattoo. Made me feel really secure. My two other sisters got theirs done by Nando. AWESOME guy! Gave them exactly what they wanted and took his time. The people here are so kind and welcoming, makes you almost feel like family.</Text>< Pictures>

Great place to get a tattoo. My son went there and was happy with the artist and the price. With so many tatoos parlors around now a days it's hard to find a good place that'll take good care of you and not charge you to much. So I totally recommend this tattoo parlor. . .<//Text>

My husband and I went there today to get his wings on both of his arm done with Rica. When we first arrived there we were welcomed by Pabo who was working on another client tattoo, but he made sure to acknowledge and let us know our tattoo artist was going to come out shortly. Pabo was friendly and professional and I saw his artwork on his client which was absolutely gorgeous. When Rica finally came to us he to was very professional and friendly. My husband was nervous getting both of his arms tatted at the same time, but Rica was patient and gentle with him. Now the aftermath of how my husbands tattoo turned out was amazing and very well detailed. This will be our permanent ink stop shop. I highly recommend Pabo and Rica they are the best in town and if you live far it is definitely worth the trip and distant to get quality and great customer service.<//Text>

Not sure about there tattoos if they're good or not but piercing wise it was a horrible experience I got my tongue pierced for WAY too expensive and I kept saying it was crooked and he insisted that no and yes it was crooked lol and my friend got her nose pierced and was bleeding so much he started accusing her that she were "drunk" a couple weeks later my tongue got infected I went back just so they can tell me that the guy who pierced my tongue didnt even know how to pierce!!!

Firstly, the tattoo artist were taking about male genitalia in a very explicit way not caring there were female customers present. Secondly, I was there for about 35min in which the guy who was supposed to do my tattoo took 5 minutes to prep and about thirty minutes to simply have a conversation with everyone else in the shop. We were literally just standing there waiting to get work done while he was simply talking about chicken recepies to everyone else ignoring us completely as if we were to be attended when he felt like. We walked out we felt super disrespected and we will never recoment this place to anyone ever.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Best produce in Santa Barbara! It is a mini Farmers market with delicious produce as well as local eggs, cheeses, honey, bread and much more.  So much easier to access than the Farmers Markets and open every day!< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>This is a very friendly, well-run “permanent farmer’s market” in an almost rural, out-of-the way part of Santa Barbara.
It carries in-season, locally grown fruits and vegetables as well as year round items like local honey and jams and jellies. Though a converted service station, the store is charming, very clean, and the produce is beautifully displayed. There is plenty of parking and, just a block from Lazy Acres and across the street from Von’s grocery, Mesa Produce is an easy, additional stop for food shoppers looking to keep fresh and healthy offerings on the family menu.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Not a huge selection, but high quality and low prices on produce, herbs, and a few extras like nuts and salsas. Greatly impressed with the service and organization as well. It’s my first stop in town for produce (on non-farmer’s market days) since I prioritize local and organic picks.<//Text>

This place is Awesome. The cakes and pastries are so fresh and delicious. My go to is the strawberry shortcake so light and not too sweet. They also have this incredible good thing called a meat pie and yes I am addicted!!! The potato one is good too. Yuuumm<//Review>

<Review>Tasty cake with cheap price. We ordered for the first time here birthday cake for my daughter’s birthday party for 10-12 people. It was huge cake 🥰 large size and sufficient for 20 people... yummy... everyone loved it ... just one thing want to advise you that , if you arrange big boxes with your logo for large cakes it will be great because boxes were little for our cakes .... thanks for the cake with great taste and price 😍<//Review>< Name>

<Text>The tall skinny girl who works here is always so rude, she seems to be upset about people asking a question? And gives the most disgusting attitude ever. I asked for an item that I normally get when I come here and she lied to my face saying they never make that even though I always get it. When I paid she just threw the change back at me, even though I handed it to her in her hand. Never again recommending this place to anyone.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>I sincerely want to rave about my recent experience with La . I had never been here before so I took a chance of faith and chose them to take care of my daughter's first birthday cake. I had a very specific theme in mind but the end product even exceeded what I had envisioned. The owners went out of their way to make sure I approved the flavors and had everything I wanted, even with a time crunch. The price was very reasonable and the taste was phenomenal. I am just blown away by the service and kindness of this business. I highly recommend this bakery for all your sweet tooth needs. I will be returning again and again and again..</Text><UserId.>107609196528015575078<//UserId.>< Date>

<review>PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS BAKERY. They do not know how to keep orders. I ordered cupcakes a week ago and gave the money beforehand so they would do a great job by getting it prepared early. Guess what, I go today to pick them up, they tell me, “I am so sorry but we haven’t even worked on your order yet”. What a disappointment. I never write reviews but I had to warn people about this lazy bakery. If you order from this bakery, expect the worst. It broke my heart because they were not ready. If you are ordering anything for your child or for your loved ones, please do not let this bakery be your first choice because it will leave you heartbroken and then you have to decide which other bakery is open at the hour. Please do not order anything from this bakery because they do not do their job professionally. If you order something, it might not be ready or it might turn out like a different cake. I DO NOT LIKE THIS BAKERY. What a waste of time and money!</review><user_id>110415428077683879462<//user_id></record>

OMG, this was the best vanilla bean cake I've ever had, it wasn't to sweet it was just right. Even my complaining mom enjoyed it lol...The customer service was great. Mr. Romel was extremely nice and helpful. I will definitely be purchasing more cakes in the future.< /text>

I can only comment on one aspect of this bakery as it is the only thing I order (and this is pretty regularly): The Banana Pudding.

It could use better seating places for people to hang out.< /Review>

<text>I got a cake from here and it was highly recommend to me by my neighbor. This cake was for my mom, the lady was really nice and everything. We asked simple questions about the cake:
1) Is the outside whip cream? Or frosting?
2) Does it have fruits in the inside? If so what kind?

The clerk told us it was a whip cream cake with fruits inside, she wasn't clear with the fruits. When we went to taste this cake. Not only is the cake a frosting base but the fruit was a raspberries. THAT WENT BAD ALREADY.  This left a really bad aftertaste and a bad remarks everywhere even my guests. I've never felt so bad for the cake, the bread was really good every one ate the bread not the rest. It's sad to say I have only filling and frosting leftovers. Gross....

If your clerks aren't sure when these cakes where made at least let them know what the heck is in the cakes or something. Aside, I might come back but I am not confident about your cakes.... Sorry.</text>< name>

This is a great place to get a cake!
I ordered the cake 1 day before birthday party by phone and the cake turned out beautiful.
We had about 30 people and every single person raved about the cake. They could not get enough. It was delicious, moist and light and not overly sweet. Loved it!
Fantastic fresh quality and their prices were very reasonable.
They also have a number of delicious French and European pastries, cookies and warm fresh breads.
I highly recommend this place for buying cakes and will be coming back for more treats :)<//review>

This used to be my #1 neighborhood bakery in East Hollywood but recently they have been making their cream puff pastries and chocolate eclairs (my favorite) about 1/2 size smaller than it used to be for the same price so of course  I was a little disappointed but I still love this place. I can't understand the reason for this like their "regular" customers are not going to notice? Other than that, you get friendly service.
I complained so hopefully they will change back to their original size again and I will give a 5 star rating.<//review>

Every time after a purchase, I have to ask for a check, it seems that the cashier does not know that after making a purchase he is obliged to issue a check to the buyer. Teach your cashier how to work.

Тут можно купить очень вкусный лаваш, который невозможно донести домой целиком, половина сьедается в пути :) К сожалению в последнее время, у кассира беда с чеками. Каждый раз после покупки мне приходится просить выдать мне чек, такое ощущение, что кассир не знает, что после осуществления покупки обязан выдать чек покупателю. Научите вашего кассира, как нужно работать.<//Text>< Pics>

This was a really impressive restaurant. The menu had all the mainstays of Southern Californian Mexican food, but it was also packed with gems you don't often see at other places. The chiles güeritos, stuffed with shrimp and cheese and roasted, were particularly impressive. I can imagine sitting at the bar and enjoying a large plate of these with a couple of cold beers. Our entrees were also wonderful: birria de chivo and tampiqueña, and the handmade tortillas really shone. The service was impeccable. Our server, a friendly young woman, readily and warmly provided recommendations, and she helped us find an out of the way outside table, in order to accommodate out large dog, whose birthday we were celebrating. We're looking forward to finding another excuse to come to Indio, so we can explore more of the extensive menu at this top-notch desert restaurant.<//Review>

<Review>Outstanding service, great food came with my wife and we could not get over how much the service was. As a customer this is how it should be. I could not ask for anything better at Bourbon Steak we did not like our first meal and they took it off right away and gave me something way better. Every single person the hostesses the waitress everyone was so kind. We will be back when going to Los Angeles.< /Review>< Pics>

We love the El Campanario, and we visit the restaurant once or twice per month. The food is excellent and the family who owns the restaurant are very nice and more than accommodating. The restaurant is clean and comfortable with spacious booths, along with tables and chairs. Outdoor dining is also available.< /review>

I ordered the "eggs diablo" and after a short wait filled with wine and conversation, we got our food. The presentation was really fun and made me drool a bit just looking at it and once I took my first bite, the conversation stopped. It was savoury and spicey and the toast was perfectly toasted but soaked up the juices of the heirloom tomatoes and peppers on top. The eggs were done perfectly and thought there was a bit more oil at the bottom of the plate, I joyously sopped it up with the bread till there was no more.</text>

Ok, so far, this was one of my favorite ribeye steaks all-time.  So far, Harris' steak is only equalled by The 555 East American Steakhouse in Long Beach. (Triple Nickel) I always get my Ribeye Rare with sauteed onions.  Great Service. Lobster bisque was awesome too!< /review>

Good food. Good service. Good atmosphere. I've been here a couple of times and it has been great. The food is amazing and is served at a reasonable price. Music is not too loud or not too quiet. The staff are nice and responsible. Love this place.< /Text>

<Review>Working out of town, this was the closest restaurant to my hotel, so I gave it a try.
I had the Chile Verde burrito and a couple margaritas. My margaritas were fantastic for a house margarita, very generous very tasty! Burrito was equally delicious and generously portioned. Price couldn't be beat for a full service restaurant, and service was on point never had to ask for anything  never felt interrupted. Down side is I'm only here 1 night!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This restuarant had all the appeal of a nice place to eat. The interior is nice. They have an open bar ect. However,  the food was "less than perfect". The meat in the tacos and burrito were not fresh or highly overcooked. I've had better salsa from a jar bought at dollar general. Very disappointed. As you may see I don't normally leave reviews of this nature, however this was such an negative experience for myself and my children I felt the need to save someone a disappointed visit.< /text>

The food was pretty good, I got soft tacos hard shell tacos Dorado machaca and the campechana was a tasty, but the stars are only for the food.the service was confused. I came in for a to-go order of three soft tacos with chicken into Dorado tacos la machaca and I had to repeat myself a number of times and even then they came out and asked me if my chicken tacos were going to be Dorado. it wasn't a language of thing either, because the guy just kept on saying stuff over and over kind of wrong what sort of ended up being an Abbott and Costello affair.  But I really enjoyed the campechana</text>

<Review>A comfortable setting, a friendly smile, and delicious and authentic food!  The tastes are familiar, but the freshness of the ingredients and the professional preparation make the difference.  Crispy tacos with beef seasoned just right, and the enchilada sauce made this the right choice for lunch...and horchata!
My beautiful wife ordered tostadas but were unable to finish them both.  Plenty on the plates!</Review><GmapID>0x80daf9d71b55fbb5:0xe7cafed5567e256c<//GmapID><UserId.>102729032752408572004<//UserId.><Rate>4< /Rate>< Date>

Wow! What a pleasant surprise. We must have driven by this place hundreds of times and despite it ratings and busy parking lot a dinner times we have never visited. Everything we tried was delicious. The food arrived quickly and the staff were helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back.<//review>

I believe this is the worst Mexican restaurant on the planet: nothing is is as it should be.
The salsa tastes nasty and store made.
The service is horrible  think the staff doesn't care if you're there.. White or Latino.
The food is reprehensible nothing tastes familiar nothing is hot it's all wrong it's like you've gone into a different dimension
The restaurant is like a hologram of a Mexican restaurant that some robot invented!!!

I'm not making this up I cook Mexican food, I make tamales Chile Colorado I make chili verde I make my own tortillas and I'm white.

I suggest you run from this restaurant.<//Review>

Good food. The servers never change, always the same people. My cup was dirty , had to send it back. If there is a game on at the bar, the server takes a while to get back to the table for refills. The kids meals are quite limited also. The price range is on the high side</Review>

This is a delightful restaurant with able and willing staff. We go in as a group and they
are willing to do individual checks. They accommodate special orders. They have a wide choice of food and everything is delicious. What a wonderful choice to have in Indio.< /Review>

Quality Service was quick to sit, serve and servers worked like teamwork constantly inquiring if we were ok and if we needed anything. At one point i saw the owner or manager with his servers scoping out the restaurant and pointing out tables to service. Like a captain and servers at a 5 star resort. The food was flavorful. Plenty of seats or booths to select. Dish presentation looked delicious.  The chile hueritos were delicious. The salsa was warm, mild and lots of flavor.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80daf9d71b55fbb5:0xe7cafed5567e256c</Gmap_id></record>

We stayed in Indio for 1 night recently, and decided to fully commit to eating Mexican food while we were in town.  I had mole chicken enchiladas, my boyfriend had something delicious (I forgot what he ordered but he thoroughly loved it).  We had a beer, a little wine, dessert, it was a very cool, calm vibe on a Saturday night.  The food was crazy good.</text>

Food was ok but wish it came out hot. Basically room temperature when we got served. We were visiting from the valley and had never ate there. Our waiter seemed bored and annoyed. Didn't bother to ask if we needed anything after we got our food. It wasnt super busy and they had enough help. *shrug*< /Text>

We decided to order for the kids first while we took a few more minutes, well server never came back to take our order. Another server who brought out our food realized it and took our order. Then to top it off my food was horrible!!! We tipped the lame server not that he deserved a penny, but because of our etiquette.< /text>< pictures>
