<Text>San Diego County Solar provided excellent service, excellent workmanship, and an amazing experience from start to finish on our solar project in Escondido, CA. I interviewed 8 solar companies and San Diego County Solar impressed me the most with their depth of knowledge and customer centric consultative approach. I really liked that they are local and independent and can choose to source whatever solar parts and products fit the client's unique situation. San Diego County Solar is a results oriented, solutions focused team. The install looks fantastic and the quality of the work is top notch. They also have great workmanship warranties and source products with strong guarantees. To Seth and the team, thank you for all your hard work! We couldn't be happier with our choice.</Text><date>1617070995500< /date>< rating>

Seth and the whole SDCS team was terrific.  Very professional throughout the entire process.  Seth walked me through every question and concern I had about selecting the right system design and equipment.  He was informative, educational, and friendly.  The install team did an incredible job with a very clean installation even paint matching the house for all the conduit.  I have already recommended SDCS to several friends and family members. Compared to other companies in which we got estimates from SDCS was VERY competitive and the most transparent with their pricing approach and ways to save.<//review>

< Review>
We had solar installed a few years back and needed to add more. The company we had gone with before is now defunct and a friend highly recommended SD County Solar. Seth and the install team were super knowledgeable and were more concerned with us understanding how it all works rather than just selling, installing, and leaving. We had an older, broken panel and they tracked down the manufacturer to submit the claim and replaced/installed it for free. That was totally above and beyond. They take pride in their work and it shows. There are truly good people working here.<//Review>

We were interested in installing solar at our home and shopped around with different companies.  We were referred to SD County Solar by a friend and the introductory process with Seth was easily the best.  He was very responsive and knowledgeable.  Once we got the process going,  the installation was smooth sailing and professional.  We appreciated that SD County Solar was actively looking for methods to keep the solar panel aesthetic impact minimal (wiring, grounding, etc).  Seth continued to follow up with us after the installation and ensured we were happy and answered all our questions.  We love being a solar household now and would highly recommend SD County Solar!<//Review>

< Review>
Day 3 with our solar panels up and running.  San Diego County Solar was a pleasure to work with.  After closing the deal with Seth, we met his installation crew who were a delight to work with - friendly, professional, instructive.  They really seemed to enjoy their jobs.  The communication was excellent from day one.  The finished work on the side of the house was neat and polished.  After firing up the system, Seth spent some time educating me about the online app for monitoring energy production.  I feel confident that if I need help in the future with the system I will be able to reach out to San Diego County Solar for support.< /Review>

We recently had a 5.6 kW solar system installed by San Diego County Solar and the installation went smoothly without a hitch. The work crew was courteous and professional. Seth guided us through the process from planning to completion including obtaining permits and dealing with SDGE. I am pretty geeky, and he patiently answered all my questions about the nuts and bolts of the installation. The system has been in operation for a few days and we are completely happy the result.</text>

We had a thoroughly professional - and enjoyable - experience with The San Diego County Solar team.  The owner, Mike Davidson, gave us down-to-earth answers to all our questions, and the installation team was a great bunch.  All our electricity last year was essentially free; with only 8 panels, we paid SDG&E about thirty bucks.

We highly recommend this company.  And by the way, there are 6 or 8 other happy customers in just our neighboring blocks!</Text>

Mike & his team came highly recommended by a number of friends who had used SD County Solar.  They lived up to the hype.  My husband had a particular concern about the method most of our neighbors' homes were using for mounting the panels.  Mike did research and discussed options with him.  We settled on "portrait" method, which costs more but is less likely to cause leaks long term.  The point is: Mike will listen to you and research your questions, if needed.  Then he will discuss and help you make the best decision.  It has been several months since installation and we are very happy with SD Solar and with our savings, and feel good about doing the green thing.< /text>

I called to get a quote for adding a secure power supply to my SMA inverter.  Seth took my information and after some research determined that my inverter wasn't compatible with what I wanted.  This was after another company actually quoted the work without doing a bit of research.  Seth was friendly, knowledgeable and communicative.  Even though I didn't use their services, I can recommend them solely from this quoting experience.<//text>

<review>I’m not one who writes reviews to praise companies for doing what they contract to do, however when the business goes above and beyond what I expected, then I’m glad to praise them. San Diego County Solar and Mike Davidson did everything right when installing my solar.  They also provided a superior design to their competitors, a lower cost, installed ahead of schedule and left the jobs it looking better than when they arrived.   Furthermore, my solar system will save me more money Than I thought as the system is producing more electricity that expected.

Our solar installation, from San Diego County Solar, has been up and running for about one month.  Seth always kept us informed: when the crew would be here, the next step(s), and in addition, was always available to answer our questions. The crew that worked on the installation were very neat, respectful, and professional. After the installation, Seth came to make sure we understood how to check our systems production on our phones, or computer (as seniors - we really need that type of help). If you're considering solar, call San Diego County Solar, they will come out, and give you the facts about solar, and then let you decide.(No Pressure Sales) GREAT JOB, and thanks again.</text>

<text>Having checked out several solar companies in the  San Diego area, we chose San Diego County Solar based upon our initial meeting with their general manager, Seth Tilley.  His succinct delivery about the benefits and pitfalls of solar power as well as his forthright answers to our questions and concerns helped make our decision surprisingly easy.  The further we got into doing research on solar energy, we were very pleased that Seth took the time either by phone or personal visits to make sure we understood everything we needed to know.  His efforts to ensure we were comfortable with our decision and to make sure we understood the installation aspects of the package we chose made it a no-brainer.  Once the installation process began, he was on site to ensure his team did the job right the first time.  We are looking forward to powering our area of North County for the foreseeable future and appreciate the hard work of Seth and the San Diego County Solar team.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1581298687422, 'text': 'Thank you so much!

<Review>I’ve been running solar for about a week now and I have nothing but positive things to say about San Diego County Solar.  I dealt primarily with Seth from the company.  He came out and gave my wife and I a very thorough presentation on how solar would work for us.  He was passionate about his work and never pushed us to make a sale.  The other companies we got quotes with both kept asking about how their prices looked and when we thought we would sign up.  Seth seemed to care more about whether or not we understood how the whole project worked.  That was a huge selling point for us.

The actual workers who came out and did the installation were very professional and easy to communicate with.  They kept me informed of what they were doing and what they needed from me.  Seth was available during the entire project.  He was at the house during some of it but also very accessible if we had any questions.  And he continues to be helpful after the project helping us navigate our new SDGE bill.   5 out of 5.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>Mike is exactly what you wan tin a small community business owner. He took the time to sit down with us and explain his background, his motivation and his journey in the solar world. He has most likely forgotten more knowledge regarding the solar industry then I will ever even know.

He sat down with me and my energy bill and designed a system that would specifically fit my needs. He recommended a fantastic lender for the loan and I didn't lift a single finger for any of the construction, permitting or installation. It was as if one day everything just showed up and began to work.

After we put up our system 4 neighbors on our street also utilized SDCS's fabulous service. It honestly makes no sense to not at least set up a consultation with SDCS to see if any of their services can help you out..< /text><userid>106370471655360861996< /userid>< resp>

Quality, quality, quality. We were up and running in around 6 weeks from signing our contract to producing our own power. Seth gave us a great deal with quality panels and hid all the conduits and paint matched it to hide it all. The crews that came out were professional, courteous and absolute rockstars. If you're looking for a quality solar system with high quality service, give them a call immediately!</Review>

Outstanding Experience with San Diego County Solar

After getting four different bids for solar installation at our home, we are so glad we chose San Diego County Solar. Seth Tilley managed the project from the initial very competitive bid through the final official approvals. He is a very clear communicator, extremely knowledgeable about solar, and always did exactly what he said he was going to do. Our 1924 one-story home in Burlingame (North Park) has a shallow parapet roof and various slopes, skylights, etc. and is historically designated. Seth thoughtfully and intelligently designed the installation of our panels for maximum production with absolutely no visibility from the street. Everyone on the crew was smart, professional, and no-nonsense. So glad we now have solar, and wish other home improvement projects could be such pleasant experiences from start to finish.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>This company was recommend by a friend.  Since the first presentation, we knew that these guys really have their act together.  Seth Tilley did a thorough review of the property and presented a proposal very quickly.  He did an excellent job of answering all questions.  Since I was using PACE funding through Ygrene, Seth went the extra mile to make sure SD County Solar was qualified to accept funding from Ygrene.  He also coordinated many items directly with SDG&E when there were open items to resolve.  That was HUGE!  The day the job was scheduled -- it was so nice that everyone arrived when they were scheduled to and everything was ready to go!  It took 2 days to finish the job and everything worked perfectly.  This was one of the best coordinated house projects that I have done in a long time!  The solar panels are in back of the house and are working perfectly!!  We are very happy with everything Seth handled, he was professional, intelligent and courteous all the way through!  Highly recommend this company for your solar install!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Seth worked with me to understand the various components being proposed.  SDCS was flexible in the final round providing the panels that I felt met my needs.  SDCS even worked with my roofer of choice.  The work for the project was completed ahead of time.  The installers arrived timely, worked quietly and answered my questions. Women should feel comfortable working with SDCS.  They took time to demystify the solar system and usage. Sdcs continues to monitor my system and send me reports of usage and continues to be available  to assist me in understanding the usage reports.  5 stars for them!!!< /Text>< Resp>

Mike and his crew were an absolute pleasure to work with.  He was referred by a friend and I am so glad she did.  Mike was the essence of professionalism and his project management skills were outstanding.  He kept me apprised of what was to happen and when, and never missed a deadline.  Even got us squared away with an update to our electrical panel required to accommodate the solar.  Anytime I've had a question about the system since the installation over two years ago, Mike responds promptly and knowledgeably.  Can't say enough about how pleased I am with he and his team.</text>

<Text>If you're worried that a local company can't compete with the national solar companies, worry no more.  You will find that San Diego County Solar is more than competitive with all solar companies (I had two other bids), and offer a product that is as good or better than other solar companies.  Eighteen months ago I decided to go with them.  Since that time I have experienced the savings that they said I would (I went from around $250/month in electrical bills on average to ZERO).  I highly recommend Mike Davidson and his crew at San Diego County Solar.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

We met with Ken - super informative and organized - and peppered him with alllll sorta of questions - there are so many companies out there now doing this!! Ken was great- he met with us many times and followed up with info we asked for, nicest guy ever, too. We decided on re-roofing our home and installing 30 panels. Documents were very straight forward. They started ON TIME(!!) with the demo - the demo crew was polite, clean FAST and thorough! They cleaned up so well after each day of work- took 3.5 days in total (big home). Then the solar guys came and Ken was checking in often on progress. These guys know wha they are doing! Also polite folks- and careful. The job was complete in a week- and it looks amazing. Already saving on running the A/C in this San Diego heat!!! I highly recommend SD county solar!</Text>< pictures>

<Name>Bob Mc</Name><Pics>None<//Pics><text>San Diego County Solar designed and installed our residential solar array system in spring of 2019, and we could not be happier with the results. Ken Roberts was our primary interface with San Diego County Solar, and he could be reached  by phone, text, or email at any stage during the process. Additionally, he was on site for major phases of the installation to coordinate with us any details that needed to be confirmed. This level of personal accessibility and contact with a company representative (Ken) in a project of this scope is invaluable.

We found the San Diego County Solar installation crew to be courteous, respectful,  and professional. We were notified of the scheduled work days and times, and updated as well of any changes due to poor weather. During this period there was a substantial amount of rain, and the crew worked around these delaying obstacles very efficiently. During the installation process we were consulted regarding the placement and locations of outdoor electrical conduits, the  painting of reflective surfaces to match the home colors, and placement of wall mounted components, and all of the installation details fit properly with HOA requirements.

Ken and San Diego County Solar also handled all of the interactions with SDG&E; our participation was limited to logging into our account and, under Ken’s easy to follow direction, making the required selections in the online portal to switch our account to that of a solar generation customer.   Additionally, Ken and his colleagues managed the fast-tracking application for solar activation that allowed our system go online with SDG&E within one day of the City Permit being approved.

It has been six weeks since our system went on-line, and it is clear that the projections Ken made for the system production levels are accurate and honest; if anything his projections for electricity generation were lower than what we are actually experiencing.

If you are considering a solar installation, we whole heartedly recommend Ken Roberts and San Diego County Solar as the vendor of choice for such a project. We found them to be honest, fair, and conscientious about their work and their relations with their customers.< /text>< time>

<text>What a great experience from initial informational meeting, to system design, to installation and all the way thru to turning it on once SDG&E said we could turn it on. Ken Roberts held my hand throughout the process, keeping me well informed about what was happening and what was coming next. The install crew worked seamlessly with a local roofer who was needed to put the panel supports on our stone-coated steel roof (Decra Tile). The installation was clean and passed city of Poway inspection with no issues. A few days latter SDG&E gave us permission to operate. So far (only 4 days after PTO) the system is performing above expectations for this time of the year and the meter is spinning backwards as we send some excess power back to the grid each day. I can highly recommend San Diego County Solar, especially if you want a trouble free process of adding solar to your house. Looking forward of years of solar powered electricity.<//text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This has been the best experience I have ever had with a contractor. Mike is straight forward, honest, and friendly. His crew had our solar in ahead of time, and my system was inpected and approved within days. It is really great to watch how much energy my system creates during the day and even better knowing that I will only pay $5 per month to SDGE for a meter fee. I have already recommended Mike and his company to others, and will continue to do so from here on out. Thank you Mike and Crew for a great experience and a fantastic system.< /Review><GmapID>0x80dc72f6fd3f1f85:0x5f7c979def685e85< /GmapID>< date>

<Review>I have been homeowner and income property owner in California and Florida for over 30years with a wide variety of experience working with contractors and service companies. Our primary home in Encinitas has turned 30 and was in dire need of upgrades and repairs that included the help of, San Diego County Solar, along with, a general contractor to remodel our kitchen and floors, a roofing company, an air conditioning installer and a painter. Each of those companies had something I liked about them, such as; the price of the cabinets, the profesionalism of the Air Conditioning company, the quality of the roofing or the neatness of the painter.  San Diego County Solar has the best of each of those services combined into one company.
Ken Roberts along with his team's attention to detail far surpassed any of the other contractors. He was communicative, professional, was able to deliver on every detail he said he would and the company left no stone unturned. If you are considering Solar in Encinitas or anywhere else in the county do the smart thing and contact San Diego County Solar and be at ease knowing that you will be working with the most dependable, conscientious, company that I have ever worked with in my life.

< review>
Working with MIke and his team at SDCS is exactly how working with a professional should be but often isn't.  We contacted Mike Davidson after a Rotary friend recommended him to speak about adding solar on our Encinitas home.  Working with Mike was easy and painless and his team were all professional and a pleasure to be around.  Mike recommended the right number of panels and make the process simple.  When installation time arrived, his team was on time, efficient, and finished our job on schedule.  Mike walked us through the inspection and getting our SDG &E  account set up and within a month we had a reduction in our bill from our normal $350 to about $9 in the first month.  It has been one of the best investments we could have made.  I can highly recommend Mike Davidson and his team at San Diego  County Solar.<//review>

<Review>Jan's Health Bar is an eatery offering a decent selection of customizable healthy food and beverage options. I like the art on the walls. I like their seating arrangement outdoors. It's somewhat of an open space inside and outside. It's not really the space for someone looking to eat in a booth or a bit out of the way. It's optimal for someone looking for food to go. If you want, you can watch your order in process to completion. The employees wear masks when preparing orders.

Thanks for providing such great customer service Jeff. God willing, in a potential future visit, a nutrition facts menu will be available.< /Review>< time>

This is a fantastic place to get fresh squeeze juice first thing in the morning a juice cleanse makes it easy if you live close by check the hours they open nice and early.

<Review>It was ok, nothing amazing to go back! I ordered Jan's salad with chicken salad on top and : the salad was overdue with sherred carrots  ( like way too much) and the chicken salad was really dry , my friend ordered a chicken salad sandwich and for her reaction it seems it was ok but not great but her smoothie was really good, it was pb and bananas< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_ZfUjNH4yW9fQJ-pwDutN_BaWZ_G7CE3QdxRe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

I always have to check the bag when I get take out because the smokey working the counter usually can't get through the order without at least messing up something on it.  I get it.   You're young and want to get through the day but at least TRY to focus.<//Review>< Pictures>

Food is fresh, but pricey and order details are often overlooked. Customer service used to be great, but is so poor now that even the local regulars face disrespect. A real shame for such an HB landmark. Alex, you are genuinely missed.</Text>

< review>
Great find in Huntington Beach. We shared the ABC bowl, which was delicious. I wish it had been made with peanut butter instead of almond butter- it would have paired better with the cacao. It wasn't my favorite smoothie bowl, but these ingredients were high quality so I would go back and try something different. They are also very fast here! Other places I've gone to take much longer. Their green juice was good but very tart- hard to drink it when paired with a sweet bowl. I would go back!</review>

Just tried to call in today to place an order for pickup. It's my birthday and I want a  picnic lunch. I was on hold for 15 minutes while I agonizingly listened to the girl take order after order. I was totally ignored. While the food is good that service was awful. I hung up after 15 minutes since I was forgotten about on hold. Called Mother's restaurant instead and put my order right in. Save yourself the hassle and find a spot that will take your order.<//Text>

Recently found this and the two wraps I've had were good. I noticed that they were salting them generously and stopped that practice - very harmful and strange for place that calls itself "healthy". Have to be careful of that high sodium - not healthy</review>

<Text>You know you’ve been really unhealthy lately when you’re craving vegetables. I stopped by Jan’s health bar on my way to the dog beach in order to fill up for a long active day and really enjoyed one of their salads. I’ve worked in food for five years and was surprised that they gave me a very generous portion of meat and there was a lot of kale and healthy vegetables that filled me up and made me feel like my money was well spent for what I got. overall I’m glad to see that there are still health bars out there that have truly healthy food.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd2146cd4dab03:0xfc29aa00a081f73</Gmap_id></record>

The soups are also one of the best things to get if you are cold, sick or just plain hungry. The restaurant was remodeled recently and there are several large table to eat at inside. They have 2 high chairs too.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Long time local who's been here many times. Food is really good and fresh. Recent expansion is great. Now for the disappointment:  1) One day 5 employees were looking out the window laughing at a homeless man digging in the trash for food. It was really sad. Jan's, you make enough money on your food to encourage your employees to show compassion and do the right thing.  2)  It takes forever to get your food.  While the comradery employees show with each other is great, they ignore the customer.  They talk away and slowly put together your sandwich and slowly put the sandwich in the bag and stand there finishing their conversation - forgetting customers are on their lunch break  3)  When you order or finally do get your food,  don't plan on being acknowledged.  Jan's could take some ques from Starbucks here.  A smile and eye contact go a long way. BTW: When I bought a gift card from Starbucks on main for a homeless man, they also gave me some extra food for him!< /text>

<review>Remodeled and expanded but just as good as the original spot! The restaurant is at least twice as big as before but still serving the same delicious food and smoothies as before. Sandwiches and salads are really delicious and if your feeling risky and already went to the gym that day order a smoothie, it won't disappoint. The only criticism I had is the last smoothie had a blended up date pit and the chunks were annoying but that is the FIRST time that has ever happened to me and its hard to inspect every single 'pitted' date. Love this place, definitely top 3 sandwich spot in HB!</review>< UserId.>

You can tell it’s a simple case of spending too much on a renovation and skimping on the product from her even more expensive prices. It’s a bummer</Review>< pics>

I ordered something very simple just a wrap with Veggie Turkey and it was nice to sit on the patio with the dogs in the sunshine. I had not been in several years and look forward to trying some of the new items on the menu next time I go. Lots of good vegan options and everything on the menu is healthy.  Juices smoothies wraps sandwiches etc.< /Review>< user>

Overpriced, came in for a smoothie, asked to replace cacao with peanut butter (less expensive) and I’m told that I can remove item an but if I want  to add peanut butter I have to pay 2$ for it lol, am I buying a whole jar?? I declined, got my already 9$ smoothie, it tasted like ice and milk, I paid 2$ for more peanut butter - total waste of money, flavorless, overpriced - go to water brewery this place is a total hit or miss every time I’ve come and always overpriced</text>

Ridiculous really. My understanding of the “rule” is each separate $5 or more purchase qualifies for a “stamp” on your Jan’s card. There were four of us each making our own separate purchases (3 of them were my out of town guests) so we thought we’d just use my stamp card since they don’t live here instead of being wasteful and starting 4 new cards. I guess that was too complicated of a concept.
Long story short the young ladies and the MANAGER were weirdly rude and even accusatory about the situation when one of my guests went back up bc she didn’t get a card stamp. She actually had to say “I’m not lying” while they stood their staring at her as if she was trying to rip them off.  I personally don’t see the difference between 4 cards vs 1 if you paid good money for your items. Honestly, the most annoying thing about the situation is once again the lack of quality customer service and the fact that they made us feel like we had done something wrong instead of just smiling and saying, “Hey, let me get you a new card for your purchase!”.  Really guys?</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>Not what it use to be when Jan owned it. Less avocado, smaller sandwich’s , downgrade on the bread, and just today got a peanut butter date shake and it’s not thick like it use to be but very watery and milky. Because there are limited health bar places people still love it. But I am very bummed at the changes.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I absolutely love Jan's health Bar! I have been eating their soy turkey and avocado sandwiches for over 10 years - their soups and smoothies are the best too! They have a brand new location in Eastside Costa Mesa that is just like the original. Costa Mesa is so lucky to have Jan's!<//Review>

<Text>Absolutely the best Nishi sandwich you can get been eating there for over 30 years Jan doesn't own it anymore but still can get the soybean turkey sandwich with the Sprouts cucumbers avocado excetera excetera Tomatoes just delicious makes you feel better after you eat it only bummer is I can't buy the whole loaves anywhere anymore Worthington soybean rolls they stopped Distributing to the public only for restaurants what a bummer but an excellent healthy sandwich!❤<//Text>< pictures>

Way way expensive for what you actually get. I think it's only popular because there are not any other straight sandwich places downtown except for Subway.  Also, thumbs down on the Purps.</review>

Victory Taekwondo has been the best for my daughter. She is learning self-control, respect, discipline and self-defense. The staff is amazing and  the way they teach is unique!< /review>

<Text>My daughter just turned 4 and was extremely anxious to try. Master O supported her throughout her first day. Master Mike made sure she was engaged and welcomed into the group. Now, my daughter is in her third week LOVING it. I'm excited to see how much growth the instructors could provide.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

My boys have been at this studio since August. They joined the competition team in January. The first time they competed in March, they did not know what to expect and it was an overwhelming experience for them. After that competition they came back to the studio knowing what skills they needed to work on. Last weekend they both received a gold medal in sparring. It was amazing the transformation over the last two months! Overall, we have been at this studio for 2.5 years. My girls started first and the boys seriously couldn’t wait to start. I have absolutely loved watching them gain confidence and strength. My girls are almost to black belt. We cannot wait to see them test at the end of summer. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a healthy environment for their kids to get involved in martial arts to sign up here!< /Text>

<Text>We absolutely love Victory Taekwondo for our 4 year old!  The instructors are a combination of strict and kind.  I especially love that the classes for younger children are only 30 minutes long.  My husband and I wanted to try it out and we will definitely continue sending out son here.  Great environment, great location, and a wonderful way to gain self-confidence.  Thank you Victory Taekwondo!<//Text>< username>

Victory has been the best choice my daughter has ever made. She has pushed her self daily and is now 1st degree 4th Gup black belt at age 8! She now is completing and did awesome 2 gold medals and 1 silver in her 1st US Elite taekwondo tournament in Oceanside. We couldn't be prouder. 3 1/2 years of dedication and discipline is what she has learned it shows in all of her daily, school and at home. She now wants to be a instructor and Master one day. For a 8 year old to see her goals possible and just in front of her makes me proud parent. Thank you Grand Master Kim, Master Michael and Master O.<//review>

Fantastic place to take your child to learn discipline, respect and focus. My daughter has been going here a little over 8 months and  it has really improved attitude. Also her self confidence has sky rocketed. The staff ( grandmaster down to the black belt assistant's)  are kind, patient, and attentive to every students needs. The program and classes are extremely affordable.<//text>

We were introduced to Victory Taekwondo when we saw them volunteering at a local community event. My son got so excited watching the students and has not stopped asking to go. We signed up for their four week promotion and he absolutely loves it! The teachers and office staff were so kind and helped us get set up and helped my son feel so comfortable.< /Text>

My 5 year-old daughter has been coming here for about 7 months and the changes in her are miraculous! Her confidence has improved, she has better focus, and a better attitude. All of the Instructors are nice and encouraging. I definitely recommend this center.< /Review>

<Text>At first I was afraid that I was going pay for something my son wasn’t going to like. So I walked in and I was greeted and informed about a great deal. “4 weeks for $39”. So I signed my son up and now he loves it. Thank you Victory Taekwondo Center for answering all of my questions. And I look forward to continue our business.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2d3c4e2f4cbf3:0x3704afe4dd77d547<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We just signed our daughter (she’s 8 years old) up for their 4 week trial. She was not happy at first, and she’s very shy. After talking with her, she decided to give it a shot. Well, not even 15 minutes into the class, we could already tell that she loves it! Now, she is the one asking when is her next class. We look forward to watching her grow in this program and hope to continue. The teachers are super friendly, and really make the class fun for the kids.< /review>

They have a very kid-friendly environment and I like that they are Inclusive meaning they don't exclude any child despite their difficulties/disabilities instead they ask how they can Help...

My four year old son, Lionel, loves Tae Kwon Do and looks forward to every class. His dad and I have noticed a great improvement since he joined the academy; he is more self spoken, confident, and respectful towards his elders. The facility is clean and prices are reasonable. Masters, instructors and assisting students are amazing and always emphasizing to students the importance of better attitude, respect and discipline, not only during class but also everywhere they go. Victory Taekwondo center, has made a possitive impact in the development of our son and we are very grateful with the academy.</text>

My son love this place. He has been learning, growing and maturing for 7 years with Victory TKD. Accomplish is replacing excuse. Participate is replacing procrastinate. Interest is replacing internet. His attitude when he finishes each class is priceless.<//Review>

If you are looking to teach you're kids Respect, Disciple, better focus, better self esteem and self defense all while having fun Victory Tae Kwon Do is the place to go. My son started clases when he was 3.5 years old, and he loves it. He has sensory processing and Tae Kwon Do has helped him so much. Within 3 months of him starting clases his self esteem was very noticeable to family and friends that didn't know he started clases. He went from being quite and shy to speaking loud and clear and raising his hand to volunteer. He also replies to everyone with a "yes, mam" or "yes, Sr". He is now turning 6 years old working on his black belt and loves Tae Kwon Do more then ever.. Masters & instructors are all amazing very friendly and do great even with the littlest ones.< /review>

I am appalled at the Victory Tae Kwon Do facility on Whittier Blvd and Sorensen! I signed up my nephew for the City of Whittier through their recreation department, the (Tiny Tiger) class was for 4 weeks for a total of 8 classes! My nephew was 3 years old! He has a speech impairment problem, when he was born, he needed tubes inserted in his ears in order to hear! Because of that, he is late on following directions and learning overall. I signed him up to give him something to look forward to during the day. On the first day of class, we noticed all kids in the class were returning kids expect for two(one being my nephew).
They were doing routines and lessons on the first day due to all the other kids already knowing what to do, so they had a few instructors pull aside my nephew and the other little boy to work with them.
Well today was the 3rd class! And the Master pulled me aside and said that my nephew isn't following orders and it isn't cause by his speech impairment!
How can you tell me, that his lack of following orders and hearing is not caused by his disability! Are you his doctor? Do you have a PhD in medicine!
And the Master also said that he can't be pulling aside kids that don't pay attention to give them one on one help and that he won't do it, he'll just leave my nephew alone to teach the other children that want to listen.
So I said, pretty much you're saying kids or adults with disabilities, or special needs or people that need extra assistance aren't allowed here because your company won't work with them to learn?!
I left that facility speechless and in tears that they did not accept my nephew for who he was as a person!
All they had to do was put a smile on their face for 8 classes a total of 4 weeks!
We didn't sign up for a lifetime of classes!
We signed up for 8!
I left appalled at what he told me!
And as we were walking out, because after being told your child is not good enough for these classes, I pulled him out of class and he said "Nina, why are we leaving?"
That broke my heart and I cried all the way to the directors office at the community center to speak with him about this horrible situation and he agreed with me and how I felt I was completely horrified that someone really expects a 3 year old to be a solider!
This is just completely disrespectful to me and my family as well to anyone with disabilities!
I hope this gets around to future parents wanting their child to enroll at this facility, please stay away.
We are all equal as one!
He is an innocent 3 year old, everyone needs to start somewhere!</text>

My twins have learned a better habit of focus, respect, and honor in the realm of practice and self defense. I have literally seen their self esteem rise after a few months of being part of Master Kim and Master Michael teachings of Taekwondo. They embody the essence of taekwondo and make it fun for the kids knowing that all kids learn at different levels. They are patient yet stern when they have to be. What a wonderful journey it's been thus far and my twins love the sport and their masters.

I have two indoor cats that share a litter box and I decided to try the scoop free box I bought from this company and it has exceeded my expectations. I was scooping everyday and now I don’t have to. It also has reduced any urine smell so significantly, I’ll never go back to regular litter. I can leave for the weekend too and know they’ll have a clean box while I’m gone<//Text>

Ben and the rest of the Invisible Fence team have always been really helpful since we had our fence installed last year. They quickly addressed our concerns, and they promptly responded and adjusted our fence when one of our kitties challenged its boundaries. I was impressed with how their customer service went above and beyond to meet our needs and make sure that our furry babies are safe. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and effective solution to keep their pets safe.< /text>

Invisible fence has been here for me for the past 10 years in Southern California.    Amazing service.  Jeremy has been my technician since I moved to San Diego  2 years ago.  Jeremy is sharp, professional and sweet with the dogs too.  Jeremy is very knowledgeable on all issues of designing and teaching the dogs about their new parameters. The device the dog wears is humane and does not cause fear or pain.  Love My dogs and Invisible Fence keeps them safe.< /text>

Had the best experience today with installing an invisible fence. My dog has the worst habit, almost like an obsession with peeing on everything in our living room that sits on carpet (we also have white carpet)... He's ruined expensive carpet as well as a very expensive down sofa. After reviewing every type of barrier online, both indoor and out, I realized that a barrier that works by radius wouldn't work as it's not specific enough. So I purchased an in ground pet barrier and called Invisible Fence to see if they'd be willing to install despite me not buying from them, because I had no idea how to even get it started. I wish I had found them before I ordered the fence from online.
They sent a very professional and informative technician by the name of Gabriel. Being that you can't dig a trench in my living room and bury them, I said he could tape the wire along the walls/floors. But he went above and beyond my expectations, he hid the wire between the carpet and the stone floor. Brilliant! Even better than taping wire all along the entire room.
I was dreading the look of wires and tape, or units in the middle of the room, not anymore. Everything is well hidden. No wonder they go by the name "invisible Fence".
Thank you Gabriel!< /Text>

We're happy to serve you and your fur family."}< /Response><rating>5< /rating><Name>Jessica Cantrell< /Name><review>My husband and I are both veterinarians in Southern California and have used Invisible Fence at our previous property in Vista for almost 10 years to help keep our pets safe in so many ways! We have a dog that likes to try to dig under fences and another that likes to run from our front yard to our nearest park if they escape, and Invisible Fence has truly been a lifesaver!

When we moved to a larger property in Elfin Forest (2.5 acres) we had their Invisible Fence Brand Doorman installed as well. This has allowed for our pets (including cats) the opportunity to go in and out of the house at their leisure, and also locks the dog door to not allow other animals from coming inside. When we don’t want our pets to go outside at certain times, we can lock the door, or program it to our own specifications. It is truly novel technology that has provided us with peace of mind when taking care of our pets on a larger property.

The Invisible Fence technology is one of a kind and their customer service is outstanding! They will even give you recommendations for professional installation of their products, and we were so incredibly pleased with the installation of the Invisible Fence Doorman right into one of the walls in our new home – with no problems!

Additionally, Jeremy (an Invisible Fence technician) was professional and quick about setting up the product and training our pets on going in/out of the Doorman. In no time at all our pets felt completely comfortable doing it on their own. He also let us know how to set the specifications on Invisible Fence Doorman and collars for our pets to help keep them safe – especially at night with many coyotes and other animals around like snakes during the day/night. He also mentioned pitfalls with the Invisible Fence Doorman - such as battery life and how often to check the equipment to be sure it is working properly.

Kelsey (the GM) has not only been quick to respond to our questions, but also professional with any concerns we have regarding the equipment and service.

Invisible Fence is truly a company that cares about you and your pets – they strive for the highest possible customer satisfaction. We give Invisible Fence and Invisible Fence Doorman our highest recommendation. We are incredibly grateful to them for helping to keep our pets safe, as well as for our peace of mind.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< UserId.>

Invisible Fence of Southern California installed a fence around our garden bed to keep our Bulldog from continuing to destroy it.  Jeremy came out three times to ensure that our puppy was properly trained and receiving the right correction.  We are very happy with the training our puppy received as well as the outcome.  Highly recommend Jeremy and the Invisible Fence team!< /review>

<text>Would highly recommend Ben from San Diego. He did a great job with the installation and follow-up training of our dog. She was getting under one section of fence and then jumping over another. Ben ended up moving his schedule around to be able to come out quickly, and she has not gotten out of the yard since! Peace of mind goes a long way! Thank you!<//text><gmap_id>0x80dc0c40150feb21:0xc338c6c0664a59bd< /gmap_id>< UserId.>

Such a great experience! Ben was wonderful and so knowledgeable. He was very helpful setting up our invisible fence and training our cat, Peter. He’s dumb as rocks so I didn’t think it would be an easy transition. Anyways, enough about Peter, I  would highly recommend in Southern California! THANK YOU BEN!<//review>

Ben with Invisible Fence came to our rescue quickly when our pet lost his collar.  It was on a Friday afternoon before a holiday weekend and Ben came by our home before leaving for vacation.  He was so accommodating and knowledgeable!< /Review>

<text>20 years ago, I purchased the Invisible Fence for my yard. My Orange County neighborhood does not allow for perimeter fencing in an attempt to create an open feel similar to homes back East. When I moved here, I completely stressed out about my dogs running amok through the front yard to the street and throughout the neighborhood. The fence cures that and keeps them in the yard, even when dogs and horses walk by and you can’t see it.  It’s been an excellent deterrent that works 99% of the time. The dogs get brave once a year or so and make a break for it, and then run right back to the house as they are immediately reminded via warning beeps and vibration as to why they shouldn’t breech the fence in the first place.  Some of my pets over the 20 years have been trickier to train, but believe me, it always ends up working, even with the most stubborn pets.

As the years have passed, I found the need for indoor deterrents.  I have very large Bernedoodles and a Goldendoodle that are fond of counter surfing. They also love trashcan nuggets.  My two cats stubbornly like to walk on kitchen counters, which grosses me out. One of them tries to get out, so I couldn’t really use the doggy door anymore, because the cat would follow the dogs outside.

Invisible Fence provides indoor solutions to these challenges.  I’m posting picture of the products, so you can see.  The cats and dogs wear collars that respond to a series of beeps and vibrations depending on how close they get to the fence line. You put the small disks on things like trash cans to keep them from eating chicken bones and stuff. Then you put the larger disks on off-limits furniture, countertops, or by the doors you don’t want them exiting.  If you’re making cookies and don’t want them in the kitchen at all, you can move a disc by the door and they can watch from the next room without begging.

My cats and dogs are happy and safe.  The fence products have lasted all these years and the technology just gets better and better.  Animals are  not traumatized because they are trained and they understand the boundaries.

The best part, though, is the service I receive. Whenever I call (less than once a year), I’m listened to and respected without being sold a bunch of things I don’t want or need. I’ve only required a technician to come out two or three times over the last 20 years. Today, I asked Ben to come out to help me with one of my cats, who has been determined to escape and wander.  Ben helped me adjust her collar and another disk solution to keep her in. It worked IMMEDIATELY.  Ben and the other wonderful people at Invisible Fence patiently teach you how to use their products in a great way that help your dogs and cats behave without stressing everyone out. Best money ever spent!</text>< Rating>

However, our dog started tearing up some garden beds in our backyard recently, so was looking for a "local" solution inside the perimeter.  They sold me a battery powered "rock" to activate the collar in a small area.  It didn't work right away, as our core perimeter system was so old it was working on a "different frequency" or something.   So a technician named Ben came out, free of charge, and made some adjustments and now it works great.   Thanks!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I am so impressed with the responsiveness of this company. They exceeded our expectations. Jeremy has a long history of dog training and in little time he had our 60 lb Poodle following his training perfectly. Ben sold us the system and coordinated installation and was also very helpful.
I highly recommend Invisible Fence to anyone who cares about keeping their dog safe. The system works!!!<//review>

We are so happy we installed invisible fence over 8 years ago to keep our dogs safe. We have a large property and have a new dog and needed the system to be updated and our new dog trained. As usual,  invisible fence was extremely responsive and very professional. Jeremy,  our technician, came and  fixed a few areas of our wiring that had been disturbed by our landscaper and to train our new dog. He was great and had our dog trained in 15 minutes and the fence back and working in no time.  We have been extremely satisfied with invisible  fence and Jeremy was truly fantastic.< /review>

This company has saved my sanity.  Ben installed a solution two weeks ago.  My cat will now stay away from the dog door area.  He learned right away.  Dogs use the door and kitty cannot.  He comes outside with me only to ensure he doesn't jump the fence.  But I feel 100% confident when I leave the house that the dogs can go in and out but my kitty will not!  Great solution!< /Text>

So happy We had Ben install the invisible fence. I live on a big property that is not fully gated and the invisible fence was the best option for keeping my dog inside the property. Ben was great at training my dog with the collar on and my dog learned very fast. I give this product a 10/10. I had the invisible fence installed in early October and has been working great ever since with no problems.< /Text>

I’ve had this system for years to protect my pack of huskies. It’s saved them for escaping over the years. The response time of the team has been great. Ben came out, listened to my issues and promptly repaired the line. Friendly, professional and easy to work with, he was very knowledgeable as well. I recommend this system often and am a loyal believer!< /Review>

Ben and Invisible Fence of So Cal has changed our lives! Our 3 year old rambunctious puppy kept sneaking out the door, running right into traffic. Ben came over and installed an Invisible Fence inside our home by the front door. After just a few minutes, Ben had taught our pooch how to stay away from the door! We can let people into our house with peace and calm. So after our pooch broke my hand trying to get at our neighbor's dog through the fence, we called and had Ben install the Invisible Fence around our backyard. Another life- changing moment! Now our dogs can enjoy the backyard without worry of any of the dogs surrounding our yard.  If you are on the fence, do not hesitate! The peace and safety of your dog is worth every penny!< /Review>

I am on my second house with an invisible fence system.  We had a large dog that was deaf and the fence keep him safe and in the yard. At our new house we have a lot of dogs walking by our house and our little guy patrols his yard and loves interacting with all his new friends while he is safely in the yard.  The office staff was very helpful and informative and I really enjoy the personal touch that Robinn provides. The entire team is exceptional and a pleasure to work with.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>This is a great company and a great product. They do a good job working with your dog in training. I like that I can feel their concern for both sides of the safety issue - that the collar not shock too much, but also that it not shock too "little" so that the dog gets out and is hit by a car. My first dog could not be contained at all. He was not neutered at the time and there were quite a few ladies nearby. He liked to go looking for a date. Once we got the fence, he stayed put. Really important since we live on a very busy road. I highly recommend.<//Review>< Pics>

Fast response and super nice people! Called on a Monday and they were here on a Thursday for a repair and large expansion.  Robinn, in the office was informative and worked effortlessly around my schedule. Our technician, Ben, was super nice and helpful, crashing through brush to make sure perimeter was where we needed it.   We have had the fence for years and all of our varied dogs have respected it.  Super happy!<//review>

Our experience with Invisible Fence and Jeremy was incredible!  After explaining our concerns  and needs with our cats, Jeremy helped us choose the best fence option for us.  He explained the installation process, choosing the best placement based upon the trees in our yard and our fake grass.  Training the cats was fairly simple as Jeremy took a lot of time setting up the training flags and perimeters, and showing us the best way to engage with the cats.  So far training has been a success and we are so happy with our purchase thanks to Jeremy!</Review>

<Review>Beyond stoked with the service couldn’t have asked for anything else. Ben was one of the best people I’ve met in San deigo since I moved here, a super hard worker and also very funny. The fence works way better then we could’ve hoped for. 10/10 I would recommend Ben thanks for everything.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>We have worked with this company several times and have gotten wonderful and friendly service each time.  Our home is in Bakersfield, they are in the San Diego area, yet they have always been able to get us in for an appointment in a very timely manner, never griping or making an issue about the travel distance, and they don’t charge us for travel time, which in itself impresses and pleases me every time!  I feel that Invisible Fence and their employees are one of the few companies left that truly care about servicing their product, good customer service, and very importantly, our pet’s safety!  So refreshing!  Kelsey was great to work with, took my service call initially and kept me updated on appointment status, and Jeremy was our tech, he fixed our problem quickly and efficiently.  They were both very helpful, friendly, and kept me informed through the process!  I absolutely recommend this company and their products for good old fashioned friendly and efficient service, and just a great overall experience!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

We had a wonderful experience with Invisible Fence and particularly with the trainer, Jeremy. Jeremy is a real expert both with regard to installation and to pets and training. He was responsive, professional and skilled at every turn. Invisible Fence was easy to work with from the start and we highly recommend them.< /Review>

We have used IF since I was in Junior High.  This was in the late 1980's.  My parents have their board and collars from the late 90's, updating collars as they added more dogs to their family.  It was so good, that people want it included when they sell their house, and this was the only reason for the update on the board.  When I started my own family (of pets) I immediately acquired my own system and I have my original system from early 2000's still running strong.  The quality of the product is high, the service offered over the years is AMAZING, including our most recent visit from Jeremy.  There is no pressure, just information(even though I am certain if he could sell more items, it would be more in his pocket).  I will continue to use the Invisible Fence as long as I have my doggies.  It is not aggressive like an electric correction collar.  Once the pups learn the property boundaries (through training and reward) they don't have any problems, and you can change all levels of warning, parameter, sounds etc.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and will stand by it!<//Review>

New pup drove us to either lose our minds with the mulch or to install this amazing tool. From my first call with Kelsey to our trainers Jeremy and Ben, this company goes beyond customer satisfaction. This team is professional and helpful in training our pup as well as communicating new skills for us. They valued my time by always arriving at the time scheduled. I will recommend them to all my pet owning friends. It is a joy to work with them.<//text>

I do not usually write reviews but I received such outstanding service from Gabriel Rodriguez of InvisibleFence that I felt compelled to write this. Gabriel not only did a great job installing the dog fence but took the time to educate me and to be certain I understood how to use the fence. If Gabriel is an example of the type of personnel employed by InvisibleFence of Southern California they are sure to be a great choice for anyone looking for a InvisibleFence company. Thanks Gabriel for all your fantastic efforts. You were awesome!<//text>

< Review>
We recently had an Invisible Fence installed at our home in La Quinta, CA.
We have two dogs, a Border Collie and a Beagle.
We live on a golf course, and there are frequent distractions with golfers and landscape maintenance folks passing by, and the Border Collie can (and does) easily jump the 30' fence (limited height per HOA).
Gabriel Rodrigues was the Technician/Pet Trainer who installed our system and introduced our dogs to it.  The system was installed on a Saturday, and noisy equipment is not allowed then, so Gabriel had to hand dig the trench for the wire.  He did so with a smile on his face and no complaints.  The installation went smoothly, and upon completion Gabriel spent time training the dogs, my wife and me.  The dogs responded quickly.
Gabriel said we should continue the training of the dogs on their leash twice a day for 15 minutes each session.  The next morning, I took the dogs outside without the leash, and they both respected the boundaries that had been established.  As a result, I did not train them on the leash, but carefully observed them while they were in the yard.  They behaved very well, and never once broke the boundary, which amazed me.
As a result, we never did any additional training.  Gabriel returned for the second training session which was  a part of our contract.  He walked up and down by the fence and tried to lure the dogs over.  Never once did either one of them break the boundary.
We now can let the dogs use the dog door and come and go between the house and the yard, and are very comfortable doing so.
Invisible Fence is an outstanding product and works superbly for us.
It is not inexpensive, but it has been worth every dollar to us.
Thanks, Gabriel and Invisible Fence.  Job well done!</Review>

<review>Thanks to Jeremy and the Invisible Fence team AGAIN!   We have been using this system on our 1+ acre property for 20 years now.  It has remained reliable and intact all this time with little to no maintenance.  WAAAAAYYYY more cost effective and aesthetically pleasing than building and maintaining a 6 foot fence.

Jeremy came out right on time to check the system, refresh our old collars, marked out the territory and began training us with our new 13 wk old puppy.  He was knowledgeable, efficient, kind and well prepared.

This is our 5th Rhodesian Ridgeback that we have trained on the system and the process is easy and safe. The technology and behavioral science has improved over 20 years and now there is a more systematic approach with gradation in degree of stimulation and a more wholistic training program.    While the old training approach worked great for our other 4 dogs, this is just as easy and makes sense.  Our new puppy is already heeding the white flags and figuring out the program on the first day.  She is appropriately "spooked" by the stim but no signs of anxiety, stress or fear. Don't be freaked out by "shocking" your dog.  I know there are people out there who think this is a terrible solution, and it may be for some types of dogs who are not well trained or difficult to control.  This is far safer and more reliable than risking having your dog get out from a fenced yard (digging/jumping out/slipping through the gate) and getting hit by a car.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>Kelsey came out and did a complete survey of the property, met our puppy Roux and provided options and costs. She was very complete and knowledgeable.. Upon contract Jeremy came out to do the install and training. His dog training experence was very valuable in the three trainings that are part of the package. He was great with Roux and very helpful in helping us understand how to get the best outcomes. We are very satisfied that we have Roux properly and safely contained on the property. I highly recommend IF of SoCal..<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Have had Invisible Fence for several years and just completed training our newest dog. We can’t say enough good things about the protection offered by the Invisible Fence and the support of the Invisible Fence staff. The training provided by experienced dog trainers is priceless - Jeremy is so knowledgeable and gave great training and tips start to finish! We have two terriers and we first had Invisible Fence installed because our older dog was a runner. We were amazed at how she respected the boundaries of Invisible Fence and stays safe on our property. Now we have 2 dogs that can enjoy our property and we feel better knowing they’re trained and safe. Thank you, Invisible Fence!</Text>

Training our dog to an invisible fence was easily the best decision we made for her and our family. Before this she ran away one night and found her way back after 6 hours, but that was enough for us to call up Invisible Fence. Jeremy was great from beginning to end. Very easy to work with and extremely knowledgeable. Our dog picked up the training pretty quickly and we have a lot more peace of mind she won't get out again. 11/10 recommend this company!< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>We recently moved into a house that sits on a hill and one of my biggest worries is that the dogs will tumble down the hillside so I don't let them out in the backyard and if I do, I have to walk out there with their leashes which is no fun for them or for me.  I found Invisible Fence through google and we are so happy with their service so far.  From sales to consultation to training, it's been very easy and I'm starting to feel better about my dogs being able to roam in the back soon.  Still in the training part but the dogs seem to be understanding the concept.  I have an English Bulldog and Boxer so as you can imagine, they are not the easiest to train and keep calm.  Jeremy has been great and I'm looking forward to the final results.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>I have had an invisible fence for my dogs for 12 years now.  It was and is the best investment I have made.  My dogs do NOT leave my yard since they have been trained on the fence.  I recently had a break in the line (have had very few and most because my husband loves to garden), so Anthony from Invisible Fence came to fix it.  I got an appointment very quickly and he showed up on time.  Anthony was knowledgable, competent and friendly.  He found the break quite quickly and fixed it, knowing exactly what he was doing.  I couldn't be happier with the service.  Thanks, Invisible Fence!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc0c40150feb21:0xc338c6c0664a59bd</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Very pleased!  Jeremy and Colin have been wonderful. We had some reservations about using the invisible fence, but Jeremy has worked with us and our dogs so patiently!  The installation was fast, and the training (both with humans and the dogs) has been very thorough,.  Can't say enough good things about this solution!<//review>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>Five stars for Jon Boots and the Invisible Fence team!
We recently adopted a little terrier and needed a fencing solution for our yard that didn't involve construction or wooden/metal fencing that would obstruct our views.  At the suggestion of a family member, we consulted Invisible Fence.  Jon visited our home, did a quick survey of the features and our needs and suggested the Boundary Plus system.  He thoroughly explained the system, how it worked, the installation process, the one-on-one training, etc.  Jon was a pleasure to work with.  His salesmanship was excellent...efficient, transparent, no pressure, very easy to follow-up with.  Soon thereafter, he and Cody came to do the installation, which was flawless...even through the driveway and sidewalks...very professional, you wouldn't even know there was anything there.  Jon personally conducted the training visits and worked with our dog eagerly and patiently.  His etiquette and demeanor with our pet was superb.  And, in turn, our dog caught on very quickly and in just a few short weeks is now fully trained and we feel good about letting him out and about, without the worry of him leaving the yard.  The combination of the gentle static correction along with training to audible and visual cues seems highly effective.  Overall, great service, great product, great results!<//review><rating>5</rating>< UserId.>

I was so pleased with Invisible Fence! It's so worth it to have the peace of mind that comes with knowing the cat is safe in the backyard. There have been so many coyote attacks in my community so this was the perfect solution. This company and all of its employees (I worked with John, Anthony and Ryan), were extremely professional, reliable and knowledgeable. I was extra happy that they replaced the collar after it was lost after only one week, free of charge. So far, the cat has been enjoying the backyard for three weeks and there haven't been any incidents. We are very grateful for Invisible Fence and highly recommend them.< /Review>

Great training done by the team over at Invisible Fence. Our little mut kept on escaping and we couldn't figure out where. After getting the training and the overview on how to make sure the dog understands his boundaries it worked great. Cheaper than a whole new fence and now the dog is happy.</Review>

John has really made our situation with our dog in our new home quite comfortable and easy.  We don't worry about our dog dashing out or wanting to get out.   John was patient and professional.  He taught us how easy and convenient Invisible Fence of California was to relocate to another home.   He was also creative with our fencing needs.   If we move or ever need any adjustments, we will contact John.  Thank you for peace of mind : )<//text>

Both were very professional and made sure we had all questions answered and felt comfortable with our new fence.  Our dog is happy, safe and contained in our yard.

<text>Over the past 20 years we have relied on the Invisible Fence system to protect our dogs, who are like family members. We live on an acre + equestrian property that by necessity cannot have substantial fencing. Thus the only realistic option for us is the Invisible Fence. However, even if I could use 8' concrete block, I would much prefer the IS system. My current dog is a very enthusiastic lab, but we have had several other labs, golden retrievers and jack russell terriers on the system and they have had free-run of the entire property with the Invisible Fence. Training was relatively easy and we started our current pup at about 5 months old. He did great. My wife also had the indoor discs installed in certain off-limits areas inside the home and it works beautifully. Our neighbors are amazed at how well our dogs know their boundaries. I wish I could tell them that it was my excellent training methods, but honesty requires me to confess that it is all about the Invisible Fence. I really can't recommend it enough!</text>< pics>

Our Rhodesian Ridgeback got very lonely when our older dog died. Suddenly he started jumping the fence to run across the street just to see another dog. I was skeptical about getting an Invisible Fence, but Jon demonstrated what a perfect solution it was. He was very helpful, and responsive to every concern, his service was top notch. Highly recommended!< /Text>

We have had our Invisible Fence system for about two years now.  Our pet containment situation is perhaps a bit different than most.  We have two cats and two dogs.  The dogs were well contained by our physical fence and gates -- but the cats kept climbing the fence and going off by themselves.  We live on a busy street and needed to do something.  Jon went out of his way to make sure that we designed a system that would work well for our cats.  It has been flawless.  Our cats are quite happy with the collars and the micro receivers are not a bother for them at all.  Jon told us that the cats would get used to the slight extra weight around their neck so we gave it a try.  We were surprised that the receivers weren’t annoying for them, but it was exactly as promised.  So now the cats have Invisible Fence collars and stay in the yard.  The dogs just have regular collars (no Invisible Fence receivers) so they can just be clipped on a leash and taken for walks around the neighborhood.  The physical fence is sufficient for the dogs and we don’t have to remember to take something off before taking them down the block.  We now have four happy pets.</text>

< Review>
I have been a very satisfied customer of invisible Fence. We moved to a home near a canyon and I was very worried about my cats getting attacked by coyotes.  Invisible Fence made it possible for me to keep my cats safely indoors and even helped with training them. A major benefit for me was also the ability to finally keep my cats from scratching and ruining my sofas, and keeping my dog off the sofa at night. They also developed a plan so my dog would only go to certain areas of the back yard. Invisible Fence is easy to use and can be customized to lots of situations.  I have recommended to friends who are also very happy! We are now a harmonious and animal friendly home.< /Review>

<review>We now have the ultimate experience for our Austrian Shepard. Our dog is more content, relaxed, very happy and feels secure within our boarders. We are happy owners too! From the sales people to the trainers, they were very professional, knowledgeable, efficient and one could sense they really cared for animals. We have had 100% success with our inside and outside boarders and would highly recommend this company for your pet roaming needs!</review>< Pictures>

<review>John and the crew were terrific. We moved to a new home and our precious Bella was digging underneath the fence and getting out onto a very busy street. John trained Bella and took great care in adjusting the program to her sensitive personality. She didn't need much "vibration or shock". Just the noise did the trick. We really loved that Invisible Fence adjusted the program to meet our specific needs. And when we were all done, Bella did get out again. John responded immediately and he made some modifications and she hasn't gotten out since. We basically forget the fence is even there. Bella is happily contained in our rural yard and she's peaceful and content. Thank you John for making our life easier and safe!!!< /review><time>1495564497064</time><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

<Date>1487088739438< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>Jon Boots and crew have completely changed our living situation. We went from barely able to contain our precious and very active yellow lab Beau, to watching him roam freely on the yard without ANY fear of him getting out. He greets all the neighbors walking by every morning, and NEVER crosses his line. People stop to visit with him constantly, they know he's happy and will stay put and don't have to worry about him playfully jumping on them for a snuggle. When one of our lines wasn't working (due to a malfunction on our end, not theirs) Jon was out the very next morning to make sure Beau stayed safe (I have 4-5 different points of escape in the backyard!) They are so friendly, and flat out just do an amazing job. Our lives would be MUCH different ( and very difficult! ) without Invisible Fence of CA. I more than recommend them, I would insist on them.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<user>108338016372010014460</user><Text>We have had an Invisible Fence on our 2.5 acre property for over 13 years and we absolutely love it.  Our dog trainer recommended it and we are so glad he did.  The best part is the service -- so friendly and competent and always eager to help.  This is a great investment in your dogs, your property and your family that pays off for years to come.  All the neighbors who have traditional fences lose their dogs when the gardener, housekeeper or housepainter leaves that gate open.  This never happens with an Invisible Fence.  It is always there and when it's down, Anthony will come right over and fix it in a jiffy -- buy the service contract -- totally worth it!!!!< /Text><name>Sissy Sugarman< /name>< time>

<Review>Let me preface this review by saying I have sphynx cats, and this product is definitely designed for animals with furry necks.

First of all, Jon gets 10 stars because he is everything everyone else has said about him on these reviews while also being attentive, thoughtful about the individual needs of your pet, and he thinks outside the box to problem solve unique situations. Jon is super and I appreciate his expertise very much!

The product works. The first technician to set things up for me put the collars on way too tight and the correction was way too strong, and it really destroyed my one cats personality for a month. It was quite heartbreaking. Jon came to the rescue and solved the problem, if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have been able to continue using the product. Again, Jon, 10 stars.

The only reason I can't give 5 stars overall is because the receiver is ridiculously huge, and I really hope the company puts effort into redesigning it to be less clunky and painful to look at. It's just too big and heavy, especially for small animals. I have to remove the collars for the cats to eat, at night to give their necks a break and to prevent skin breakdown, and occasionally during the day when I just can't stand to look at it. With all the technological advances in 2017, surely there is a way to make that thing smaller. If they could do that, instant upgrade to 5 stars from me.

Jon, you're awesome! Big thanks to you!<//Review>< pictures>

Invisible Fence Brand of California is my daughter dog's favorite spot! Not only are Amanda and her team, so sweet and loving to my frenchie Penny, but they treat her like their own and pay so much attention to her needs! We come here almost every week to buy Himalayan Yak Cheese and tooth brushes ! Invisible Fence Brand of California is definitely "home" for us locals in DTLA!< /Review>

<Review>We have nothing but great things to say about Invisible Fence Brand. We have two dogs with a lot of area to explore. Invisible Fence team were great giving us advise about perimeters for the dogs, training the dogs and making us understand the process.
The dogs were set up for success and the system is very simple.
Our family highly recommends their products!! Thumbs up all around.< /Review>< pictures>

The Invisible Fence has been a godsend for us with one of our huskies. The initial consultation was great. It was very informative and stress free. There was no pushing to buy their services, no gimmicks of "if you buy today we'll discount x amount". The installation was quick, despite us having a large yard (half acre). The installers were both very friendly and professional. My husky has not gone over/under our fence since it went in, and he only ran through the front one time before realizing that's a no go lol. We had the intensity adjusted a couple of times which was very easy to do. They took the time to acclimate my dog to the new system and train both him and myself on how it works. They ease your dog into, which was great. I also LOVE LOVE the little round mobile unit for indoors. That thing ROCKS. It's so handy for a stubborn husky who is intent on getting that piece of thawing meat off the counter lol. I would highly recommend this company!< /review>

Our neighbors used Invisible Fence and their dog was able hang out in their driveway without a fence.  We liked the idea that we could leave our doors open and our dog would still be safe.  John and his staff provided all the training for us and and our dog.  Highly recommend Invisible Fence!< /review>

Couldn't recommend Jon and the Invisable Fence company highly enough. At first I was a little skeptical as to if it would work or not but it's incredibly effective. In addition Jon was so helpful throughout the entire process and our 2 huskies absolutely loved him. Great attention to detail and for the little bit extra money I'd recommend saving yourself the hassle of trying to do it yourself and get in the professionals!<//review>

<rate>5</rate><review>Gib and Anthony were both very informed technically and operationally on the system.  Several years ago we had Invisible Fence installed, and only recently needed to reactivate.  Their servicing the dog's collars and help troubleshooting the location of minor line abrasion causing intermitant interruption was stellar.  They saved us a lot of time and money (and potential heartache with dog's escaping our yard) with their exceptional customer service.  100% five stars!  Very satisfied long term customer.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Jon Boots of Invisible Fence Company for Southern Califoria was an awesome asset for Winston my 5.5 week old rescue kitten.  Winston at just 3 months old had an insatiable need to escape my property where there were coyotes and traffic.   Jon installed my invisible fence and worked with Winston to learn the system, which was quite a quick process.   I'm happy to report Winston is happy and healthy two year old that has remained in the safety of my property. Cynthia and Winston!<//text>

Invisible Fence is a great product based on a great idea.    If your property is large, or hilly, and very costly to fence, you need an invisible fence that also doesn’t interrupt the look of nature.

We had a very frustrating experience because we installed an electric fence that we purchased from Petco, then our dog outsmarted it within a week.

What is great about the Invisible Fence product is that it will definitely work in controlling your pets and keeping them in, both dogs and cats.  That’s because the Invisible Fence creates an extended barrier of noise and vibration.  Your pet won’t cross it because the barrier is several meters wider, heading out from your property than the wire line.

Invisible Fence is also a humane type of electric fence because your pet has sound and visual cues not to cross the line.  Your pets will learn how to be smart and avoid the discomfort of a shock through animal training sessions with the invisible Fence team.  A trainer came once a week for several weeks to check on whether or not your pet crossed the fence line, and which pet it was who did it.  Then the trainer continues the training and if necessary adjusts the intensity of the warning.  You'll be surprised to learn that cats are easier to train than dogs.  They understand the message a lot faster (and are less likely forget it.)

Invisible Fence also offers a very handy indoor moveable disc that you can use to keep your pet out of any room, as needed.

And finally, the Invisible Fence team members are all wonderful people who clearly enjoy their job and love pets — it’s easy to tell when you encounter people as happy and energetic as they are.  Team leader is John Boots, but every one of the guys is just as nice and competent.  Five star experience and your pets will never stray again.</Text>

<Review>Invisible Fence is a fantastic product with outstanding service!  We have had the fence for 18 years.  It is the only way we can keep our dogs in our yard.   When it was not working the staff at the Encinitas store were very helpful and the technician who came to test the fence was great and got the fence working again.   Could not be more pleased!<//Review>< Resp>

Jon was a lifesaver for our family and our dog. We have a German Shorthair that does not like to be left alone, even though we have an acre of property to roam. He was jumping our fence and running away every work day. We called Jon and he came and set up the invisible fence and began training Ace. The process was easy and Jon is great to work with. Now Ace stays on our property even if the gate is left open. We have peace of mind knowing when we leave home, Ace is safe and will be there when we get back. Thanks Jon and Invisible Fence of CA!<//Text>

Outside, he would sprint off the property and into harm's way, be it the danger of street traffic or in the orbit of the many rambling coyotes. Invisible Fence was the solution and this company's reps were very responsive to re-calibrating the "throw" and "intensity" of the both the radio frequencies and the shock used to repel Marty from our property's borders. Marty is a special case and Invisible Fence put in the extra effort to ensure our cat's safety.<//Review>< pics>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>My three giant schnauzers, my JRT and my self have been very happy since I decided to have the innovative services of the Invisible Fence.
I had several issues with my dogs before the Invisible Fence came to our rescue. My dogs were digging underneath the fence line and going away. The were also escaping thru the property gates when the gardener or other visitors would come. I was always worried about my dogs getting lost or even killed on the streets. I tried other options suggested in other pet stores that did not work for my active, outdoor dogs.
Luckily, after an extensive research I call Jon from the Invisible Fence Brand in Souther California. These guys know their business well. I was reassured about the quality of their product, lack of harm to my four legged kids and their effectivity.
Indeed, the came as scheduled, they put a cable around a 2 acres area and I have been happy and relaxed ever since with no major issues.
No more unauthorized hiking trips for my dogs!
Customer service and expertise is second to none!
The quality of the product is superb. It is money well spend!
Eventually dogs also learned to avoid the boundary area as they do not want to feel the static correction which it is not electricity.
Occasionally my biggest dog  who is over 100 lbs challenges the fence limit. Initially, I considered that as a " failure" of the system but in reality it was not a failure and rather you have to check on the battery life, or placement of the collar.
I do highly recommend this product with no reservations, or regrets.
They have solutions for your garden that I also use and my dogs stopped digging in it. They, also have solutions for indoor dogs issues but I do not need those.
More importantly, The Invisible Fence Brand of California and all those motivated guys brought security and happiness to my pets and my self...and that is priceless!

Invisible fence is a FANTASTIC product. EVEN BETTER the team and service is impecable. Especially Chris, Gibb and Anthony . They are a truley amazing team. They installed the fence promptly guided me through the process and  treated me as a first class citizen, for which is a rarety these days i might add. They then came to my house at my convinience to help train my dogs and ME on three needed occasions , shared their phone number with me for any questions i might have and by the way the # they provide actully has there voice behind it and not some computer saying push 1,2 etc. The impressionable part is when they provided me with the wrong charger for the portable adjustable signal field. I then called to notify them of this, and the next day Gibb hand delivered it to me... WOW thats when I knew that this company cares about its customers and not just there to grab your money and go. I highly recommend the product and especially this branch. GREAT JOB guys. Very sincerely and
Thanks,
Wes

Oh by the way I have a very active hunting dog that gets easily distracted and the fence works amazing he hasnt left the yard yet and knows his boundrys. I accidently left the colar off and he reconizes the flags and wont go near it, this product keeps him contained.< /text>

While visiting my niece in LA, my mom wanted to gift her a tropical plant... a beautiful Lily.

We'll stocked for the season. Staff helpful. Purchased great violas and winter vegetables - kale, lettuce and brussel sprouts. Easy parking in front at meter on the middle of a weekday.<//Review>

Lovely sisters working at the counter. Lovely old-school nursery. Wide variety, helpful service. One of their employees Paul was super helpful and helped me carry all of my plants to my car parked half a block away! Great customer service!. Great service provider.<//Review>< username>

<review>Such a big selection of all plants, flowers and hanging pots. I really enjoy their indoor plants and succulents. Have okay prices and also have a range of pots for sale.

There is street meter parking. There is a parking lot next door as well which belongs to them. Keep in mind the parking lot is in between another nursery, so make sure if you want this place you pay attention.</review><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

What a cute store! They have such a nice collection of plants and are so helpful. I've been here several times and every time I've left with a beautiful, healthy plant and a cute little care card that tells me how to take care of it. They even offer help over email, how cool is that?< /Review>

<Text>I love this place.  Great variety of exotic carnivorous plants, and fantastic customer support. Got a question?  Text it to them.  Where do you get that today in a specialty store.  Maybe other places, but definitely here.
Prices totally reasonable.< /Text>< pics>

If you always wondered about carnivores this is the place to start. Some plants are so easy to take care of!  The people here woo help with any problem you have and you can always bring the plant back if you are in trouble. Richard us the sweetest man alive and a kind soul. I highly recommend this place.< /Review>

Nice place to get out to stretch your legs and check out plants of all sorts. I like that they have separate little shops with their own specialties like succulents and carnivorous plants. I really enjoyed the fairy gardens.</text>

<Text>The selection of plants is beautiful and high quality, plus the people were super helpful. I asked if a plant was fragrant and they said no then showed me three fragrant options, including gardenias and star jasmine. The coworker I gave the gardenia plant to was thrilled with it. Great experience!<//Text>< pictures>

One of our favorite nurseries in Los Angeles!! My Wife and I bought many of our plants and succulents for our various gardening projects. One of their employees Paul was super helpful and helped me carry all of my plants to my car parked half a block away! Great customer service!< /text>

I wish I could give this place 0 stars, they over charged me by $8 and I explained that to him and the owner threw my receipt at my head and told me to double check as he also threw the calculator. So I did and showed him he overcharged me and he said ok and threw the extra dollar bills and the flew everywhere. I am disgusted with this place. Told him that’s NOT how you treat customers and asked to return all my items.< /review>

Came in to buy a couple of plants for the office but the Scandinavian woman just kept talking over me whilst I made request/questions regarding the plants and no other staff offered to help despite my multiple requests. Really weird experience. Would of been a 2 minute transaction, ended up leaving with nothing.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) When I went sightseeing from Japan, I had a very enjoyable time with a variety of plants and good condition, and very kind people who could consult in Japanese. The surrounding environment is good and Santa Monica is close, so if you like plants, we recommend that you stop by if you have time.

This is, in my opinion, the best fast food restaurant I've been to. It's conveniently located and has a big selection of Mexican food (well it should, considering "burrito" in the restaurant's name) and fast food as well.

If you're in East L.A., I can easily recommend this place. I'd choose this over any famous fast food chain any day!</Text>

Small parking in rear. Small tables inside. Space outside is nice and decent. The variety of food that is available is tremendous. The prices(majority) are below ten dollars. In this visit my wife suggested as a first visit the four tacos with a small drink. Drinks are literally small! Awesome if your trying to watch your soda intake!

I asked for two asada tacos and two Al pastor tacos joined with a coke. I uploaded some pictures of my tacos. I will admit I failed to upload close up pictures of the Al pastor tacos. Overall I enjoyed the food. The tortillas are doubled. The meat portion accommodates the size of the tortilla. Cilantro and onion are optional. As are lemons and hot sauce. The hot sauce reminds me of Kind taco red sauce. Not as spicy but delicious.

As you enter there is a bell that can be rung if the lady is not in the front. She comes promptly. Takes your order and surprisingly you pay when you are ready to leave! Wow! She is a humble lady.

Wife has had shrimp tacos, taquito combos, and a turkey sandwich. She says she has enjoyed each visit.

Recommended? Definitely. Will I go back? Yes. The variety and prices was what got my attention.< /Text>

This was just Ok. My job ordered delivery from here and when it came everything was cold. I was hungry so I ate it anyway and I figured if it's really good it would be fine if eaten cold. I was wrong the chicken was seasoned just alright I seemed to taste the salsa verde more than anything. I guess it's true once you have los tacos #1, any other taco place afterwards is wiggity whack.< /review>

<text>The worst customer service ever
The owner instead of say "hello how can i help you"?? He goes like " que vas a ordenar"??? With a freaking Attitude ,,  its not what he says, is the way and tone he says it, dude i go to your restaurant to spend my MONEY , you dont eat without customers, there was a lady and she was very nice , at least. She was polite , but these guys look like they hate their lives. If there was a 0 star rate i would it.<//text>< Resp>

<rating>4</rating><review>One of my "go to" places in La Paz. Great seafood and service, reasonable prices Andy fantastic view.  The last time I was there for lunch the music was deafening making any conversation almost impossible. We asked that it be turned down as we were the only table at that time. The waiter seemed annoyed but did turn the volume down slightly. I hope this was a one time thing, it's a restaurant not a nightclub. Disappointing.< /review><date>1539907709448</date>< Response>

Food could've been better for the pricing. Also this place is stingy with the meat. Service also could've been a lot better too.<//text>

I Ordered the  tongue tacos, al pastor, and 1 carne asada sope. I must say that my absolute favorite item was the spice level of the  fuego salsa! 🌶🔥actually spicy in comparison to all other restaurant salsas.

The cook and flavor of the tongue tacos was great. I would rate the tongue meat and salsa at 4 star. However, the price point for the portion size was too high for me. This is the reason for my  3 star rating.

Price was $2.50 for each taco; approx a 3.5 inch diameter tortilla. So, small street taco style. They have carne asada, chicken, al pastor, and lengua from what I can recall. Note there is an additional cost for lengua.

They do accept credit/debit; which was a super plus! The seating is outdoors, no wash station or restrooms so plan accordingly.
And please do be careful driving in, there are giant pot holes at the entrance</text>

< Review>
Driving down that road you have numerous options for lunch. I actually passed it by and made the decision to give them a shot. I believe i made a great choice for lunch here. The parking is good and the seating outside eating al fresco is awesome permitting the weather is good. Even though the weather was good this day i decided to drive down a bit to tejon ranch. I ordered 2 sopes de asada. Wow, they were fantastic. The sope was soft and crunchy and the toppings were fresh. Everything was seasoned nicely. The salsas were good. Wished the red was hotter but that's just me being picky. All in all this place needs more business since what there pumping out is just plain delicious. Make a stop here immediately you wont be disappointed.<//Review>

We drove across town because we heard this place was good, when we pulled up it was dead which we assumed would mean faster service.... when we walked up all 3 employees ignored us and finally the cashier tells the other employee to help us. He shakes his head and says he's busy. She then tells us to wait because she's busy too. Finally the 3rd employee tells them to help us because "they've been standing here for 5 minutes"... so finally the guy that was BUSY starts taking our order. We order a sope and he says NO WE DONT HAVE SOPES RIGHT NOW. That was the last straw.. we left and no wonder this place is empty. Don't waste your time, i wouldn't want any of these people preparing my food.<//text>

I would give a 5 star because of the food but the reason for the 1 star is because of how long they take. Went today and ordered ONE torta and waited 25 minutes. There was nobody else there waiting and nobody else there ordering. Just us and one torta. Ordered a couple weeks ago and they told us 25 minutes for one torta and it took more than an hour. They told us they just need to wrap it up. Took 20 minutes to wrap it up. If they ever get their act together i would love to go back but it takes too long. Doesn't seem like they have a good system down yet.</review>

Great little place to stop for lunch. Friendly service and excellent fair prices. I had 3 tacos, one with chicken, one with Lengua, and one with Al pastor (marinated pork) that one was my favorite but truly they were all delicious! Will definitely come back again when I visit  Bakersfield.</Text>

Very very good, tons of flavor. Would have given 5 stars for more spice.</Review>

<text>Honestly, I was wwry to go here because of all the rude/bad reviews but I decided to take a chance. I did not find it too expensive (for Rosedale), I got 5 tacos and a burrito for only about $23, which would be double anywhere else on this side of town. I found their carne asada to have a really good flavor. It was slightly chewy but there's another "fancy" Mexican place in town that is 10x chewier and 3x the price. The chicken was perfect, the rice and beans in the burrito were perfectly flavored. The salsa was perfect as well, with the mild having just enough spice but not too painful, the red sauce was much more spicy, went well with the carne and had a great flavor. I found the facility to be clean, with an outdoor eating area spaced 6ft apart to enjoy during the pandemic, the ladies were very nice, clean and speedy. I know every place has it's off days, so Im not saying other people's bad experience isn't valid, but take it with a grain of salt. After all, it is Rosedale and there are a lot of extremely entitled Karen's that live here. Give it a try, I'll definitely be going back for affordable, tasty and filling food!</text>< Pics>

It took us over an hour to get our food while people who arrived 45 minutes after us still got their food before we did. We ordered for 2 people by the way to put it in perspective.< /text>

Update: tried again.. asada looks grey and nasty, still pretty chewing.

Have they fixed the chewy asada problem yet? Every visit... same story since they became popular.<//text>

If you are calling an order in and they put you on hold just hang up and call back as many times as you have to.  I've been placed on hold for 10min plus multiple times only to get hung up on.  If you just go to the truck to order it takes 30 minutes to get your food.  The food is great but man..the service has a LONG way to go. Let's get it together I don't want to have to find a new taco truck! :)< /text>

Just moved back from San Diego to Bakersfield and these tacos are legit. San Diego is famous for the great tasting so expeditions were high since my coworkers were saying I had to try them. Not disappointed one bit. Definitely my new spot to get my taco fix.< /Text>

Good Mexican Food Taco Truck. They've set up some tables in front of the parking lot. For customers to sit and eat. So there is some shade on a hot day. Not really a Full Size, Lifted Truck friendly parking lot. But you can make it work. Pets are welcome, since it's all outside seating. Friendly employees.</review>

Okay, so I just want to say that this is very hard for me to write. I love fuegos, and I eat it on the regular. Their red sauce is absolutely my favorite hot sauce hands down, so the other day my husband and I decided to try out the new restaurant they just opened. We were less then pleased. We spent 33 dollars on two carne Asada burritos and four carne asada tacos, putting the tacos at three dollars a piece which is pretty steep for one taco, but we usually love fuegos so we paid.
Almost all the meat in the burritos was fat, which sucked, because it’s definitely not what we’re use to, and dripped grease everywhere.
The tacos that are three dollars a piece weren’t even double wrapped with Tortilla and sat in puddles of grease. I’m willing to spend more on an awesome taco, but this did not cut it.
I know they have a new staff that their still training, and having the restaurant has made them have to up some prices, but this was just not acceptable. They need to really make sure the quality of food is the same as at the truck. Unfortunately it’ll probably be some time before we go back, but we hope they can fix the kinks.< /review>

I will never take my dog for grooming anywhere else but Dirty Dogs! Amazing staff and service. When they brought out my dog, I didn’t recognize him for a split second 😂 I took him to work and within hours I had someone ask me where he was groomed ❤️ I proudly told them Dirty Dogs, called the location and booked her an appointment 🤗

Unfortunately, when I picked him up I was in such a rush and I didn’t get a chance to thank the staff appropriately.
Thank YOU staff  and Soul (I think the groomer) at Torrey Hills you guys are amazing and Friday will be back!!</review>

Awesome facility! Super friendly employees. We used the self wash for our dog while visiting and it was perfect. For $18 we got shampoo, conditioner, brushes, deshedding tools, ear cleaning solution, aprons, and towels. The tubs are just the right height so you don't have to bend over the whole time. I definitely recommend Dirty Dogs if you're in the area.<//text>

Love the grooming or the convenient location but the scheduling process is so incredibly poorly managed. I've been taking my dog here for grooming for years and every time I bring her in for her appointment I never know whether the appointment will be honored, will have magically disappeared from the system, or will have somehow been switched from a haircut appointment to only a wash with no haircut. The online booking system is equally as bad as the phone-based booking.</Text>

Went to the Torrey Hills location for the first time on a Saturday for a dog grooming (10lbs maltipoo). They had SUPER friendly staff and they only took 1.5 hours when everywhere else I’ve taken my child keeps her for at least 3 hours. They gave her the best cut ever and I could tell they took great care of her. Very pleased with this business and will continue to go!< /review>

We have been loyal customers for 4 years. On March 1st of this year,  they  suddenly raised their prices for a small dog wash and haircut from $69 to $79.  We asked that our dog get the traditional miniature schnauzer cut, but when I picked him up, he had just been buzz-cut:  very short all over.  So the result is one of going from a good business to an incompetent one, and charging 14% more !  They've lost our business.< /text>

<review>Great store, great staff, great place. Our pups have had both professional and do-it-yourself grooming here. Well, the do-it-yourself was a bath. The staff is very helpful and friendly. When dogs go in for grooming, they hangout in the grooming area as a pack, no cages. The dogs seem as happy as the people. Especially cool is that there is a dog park above the parking lot so you can let the little ones get tuckered out before going in for their baths. Highly recommended.< /review>< Pictures>

I love dirty dogs and so do my two 100 lb black labs! This is a community minded store and they go out of their way to make sure the customer has the best experience. I often use the self wash (for the dogs, not me) and the staff or always keen to give me a helping hand. All around good feeling when you go to this store!</Text>

Great customer experience. I went to wash my 90 lb German Shepherd and they were so helpful and sweet-- definitely animal lovers! The facilities are clean and modern, the shop is cute, with lots of boutique-y items and high-end products. I didn't use the groomer here, just the wash-your-own option and I loved it. I've since moved, and this is no longer convenient, but if I hadn't-- I would be here regularly. Awesome experience.</text>

Brought our dog here a bunch of times and can't say anything but stellar service and staff. Even if we can't pick her up right after a grooming they make it a fun environment and I know she's in good hands.

Update 1/26/18: let's just say that for a 5lb dog at $60 is completely ridiculous and when we include the standard services like anal glands and such they never get done. Service has gone down, staff never wants to make it right. Unfortunate for the franchise.<//Text>

<Text>We got the VIP treatment today with our pups! The staff is so extremely helpful and knowledgeable about food, treats, everything!!! They taught us how to properly wash our dogs and afterwards they were soooooo soft and smelled so yummy. We are lifetime customers and will never go anywhere else!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1501430066036, 'text': 'We appreciate you kind comments which can only makes us better I am glad you enjoyed the experience'}</response>< GmapID>

<Review>I sent my sister there and now she is completely grommed and raised. Now she is so groomed that she sent her son there. Just imagine that a dog sent its son( puppy) there. And now her son is so groomed that he uses INSTAGRAM with the name of waqar something bla bla, and Besty raised him so greatly, that now, that dog likes my daughter picture. There is no doubt that he is a dirty dog< /Review>< pictures>

The worst place to take your car...I’ve gone to slot of different places but this place is bad, they do everything in a rush and give a sloppy job. Would definitely recommend somewhere else..got my tints there and now my window doesn’t stay up.. he told me to pick up my car by 9 and he said it wasn’t ready and kept it for 2 more days just to install some lights<//review>

But we're all too quick to show me the  Google Chromecast & claim that's all they had that would cast my phone apps, pics, music, Netflix, etc I could tell two things instantly one; that it was exactly what I was looking for, even better, and two, that they were swindling me. They charged $50 which I thought was a little steep. But I bought it anyway, and have since seen it elsewhere for $20-$35 at the most!!! Buyer beware!!!!

I BROUGHT MY CAR TO THEM TO FIX MY AC IT WAS BLOWING FUSES. I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO KNOW HOW MUCH HE SAID HE WOULD CALL ME. I ALSO TOLD HIM I ALREADY REPLACED MY BLOWER MOTOR. HE CHANGED MY BLOWER MOTOR AND NEVER ASKED ME IF I WANTED IT DONE HE CALLED ME AND SAID CAR WAS DONE AND IT WAS $450 FOR WHAT REPLACING MY BLOWER MOTOR.

HE FIXED MY CAR WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION AND THEN WOULD NOT RELEASE MY CAR WITHOUT ME PAYING I TOLD HIM I DID NOT WANT TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT I ALREADY FIXED. HE DID NOR CARE . AND MY CAR IS STILL BLOWING FUSES

This place is over priced and cant make a decent center counsel box or place a charger port you can use while you drive.also couldn't equalize the whole system right i would give it 0 stars if i could. the owner starts acting some type of way when he knows he cant hustle someone.< /review>

I been treated very good, however it is true if you get window tint done here they sometimes do take your car without permission to undisclosed locations. I asked for 5% tint but noticed it doesn't resemble as limo tint it has a light green color. I know what 5% tint is but oh well what is done is done. If you dont have a nice car or money the owner will treat you differently he also uses good tactics and knows who he can hustle.<//Text><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

Zero stars!! The worst so far! I took my car there and they SWEARED they could fix my back-up camera!
After 2.5 hours of WAITING and paying them $120 they told me I needed a new one! I just wanted to get my money back and my camera back the way it was when I brought It in. The owner Adolfo Acosta said they could order me a new camera and it would be fixed in a week. It’s been 4 weeks and I’m STILL waiting for them “get” the camera! I’m supposed to go in Monday Sep. 3rd they said they would have the camera in and will fix it (for an additional $200). So we’ll see! I will post an updated review after Monday!<//Review>

<Text>I went to see if they can find out the problem why my truck battery was draining they told me it was my stereo that didn't work. They where so sure it was the stereo so I decided to purchase one from them thinking I wouldn't have that problem with my battery again...NEXT day my truck didn't turn on... so I took the truck back and I started talking to the employee who put the stereo on my truck and he was just being extremely rude to me that hes not the boss to go talk to the boss made me feel really uncomfortable...so I go talk to the boss he told me he was gonna fix it ..an hour goes by and no one has seen or touch my truck so I go tell the boss again and he goes and takes a look at it and tells me the two nuts are lose from my battery and that was the problem I immediately told him to take of the stereo he sold me and give me my money because obviously he doesn't know what hes doing .... DO NOT go here this people are scams they sell you stuff that dont work and say they know how to fix stuff and dont!!!!!

I can't find or think of any word that i should say about this store, other than good, great , awesome, the best, etc.etc.. This place is hands down 100% friendly, very helpful and understands the customers needs.  Adolfo the owner, is very honest, reliable, lenient and never haggle you on selling his items.  His son Albert is like his father, very smart, self reliant, and his work ethic is beyond his age. At the age of 20 finishes school and use his knowledge and degree to apply for their family business. His employees are well trained and knows what their selling and doing. Forget about Best Buy, Frys eletronics, or any other car audio or any other electronics. This place ROCKS!! Just have the patience and trust, they are the best.. I GUARANTEE！！！<//text>

<Text>Asked $250 for $50 job after the work is done. Never pay in advance before you see they completely fixed stuff, cuz they half-repair it and don’t refund you. Terrible service, deserves 0 stars at all.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I'm very dissatisfied with my visit to this place if I could give zero I would, they are a total rip off!!! I usually get my hid bulbs replaced somewhere else wich is $15  each & free labor  but today they didn't have it so I went here  for the first time and they wanted to charge me $60 supposedly $30 for 1 bulb people one freakin bulb! and $30 for labor?  cuz they had to "take the bumper off " umm that's a lie cuz I was watching the whole time it's just beneath the fender, my usual place replaces it in 10 min Max this guy's  took half and hour! Seriously?!! I refused to pay $ 60 and then he lowered $20 bucks but is still a lot for one damn bulb! all pissed I paid but I'm never ever going back to this place is horrible customer service don't recommend it at all!!! And now I see a lot of bad reviews not an honest place!<//review>

(Translated by Google) In that place there are thieves for 3 months when my car took a mat and when they put it they broke the entire top and something happened because the doors stopped serving, the insurance returned to desirle and I do not know if it was the owner or the superbisor who tended to me told him about the bad job and told me that the doors had nothing to do with the stereo job I told him then because he stopped serving and the only thing that iso was to send one of the employees to fix the insurance of the doors and they charged me 10 dls I paid them now I went to be checked because they only stopped serving they told me in owner that they were going to check it they fixed it and they charged me 30 dls that because I had a short film and that it had nothing to do with it with the estero ose that from the beginning they were bad work and for returning to fix their bad work they were charging me a total of 40 dollars more without counting that they broke the part of the board that I never heard an apology or even for berguenza now that I took him alone They put glue that shame to be able to eat that type that I do not know if the owner or manager is very good beast very presentable mr. That bourgeois that to look like this they have to be thieves and apart I charge 10 dollars for each control that put a battery because I asked them to change and according to the arrangement that they did not work and I charge another 10 dollars for each other I mean that a total of 40 dollars just for the controls is a disgusting this type of actions never bolvere to that place by abusive thieves sheet that the people who go through this citation tell it so that it does not continue to happen this are a complaint to this place to the corresponding place these places have permits and licenses and there is a place where you can put complaints about these abuses

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Very bad experience I stood as a fool for 1 hour and a half, waiting to be treated. They wanted to charge me $ 160 for a job that wasn't worth it. Only the parties are worth $ 30 new and $ 130 of labor, no mothers! Apart the parts were black in my gray car, how cool it was going to look! They recommended this place and I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. Now I will wait for my money back to my card. What an idiot I went to have gone to this place! Even with a discount they wanted to charge me more for the work than anything. The lack of customer service is the worst. A person got angry because they were not treated. They saw them standing there and nobody was approaching, just like me. Bad experience.

(Original)
Muy mala experiencia. Estuve parado como pendejo por 1 hora y media, esperando que me atendieran. Me querían cobrar $160 dólares por un trabajo que no lo valía. Solo las partes valen $30 nuevas y $130 de mano de obra, ¡Ni madres! Aparte las partes eran negras en mi carro gris, ¡Qué chulo se iba a ver! Me recomendaron este lugar y NO LO RECOMIENDO. Ahora esperaré que me regresen mi dinero a mi tarjeta. ¡Qué idiota fuí al haber ido a este lugar! Aún con una rebaja me querían cobrar más por el labor que nada. La falta del servicio al cliente es lo peor. Una perso a salió enojado porque no los atendieron. Los veían ahí parados y nadie se acercaba, lo mismo que amí. Mala experiencia.</Review>

The one who pretends to be the owner assured me that his friends knew what they had.
At the moment of connecting a harness to a trailer, the person asked his partner for help. At the time of asking the cost the owner medise (for that work we charge $ 30)
I told him that there was a lot and that he lowered it to $ 25
Be very careful with the owner (as bee treats you.)

<Review>No excuse for a 45 minute plus wait for an order I placed ahead of time. I couldnt cancel or trust me I would have. This is not some fancy restaurant where it takes food a while to be prepared, its a FAST FOOD joint. Completely unacceptable that I'm basically held hostage for an hour waiting for food I can't cancel because my money won't be refunded.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1623077564471, 'text': 'We’re sorry to hear you had this experience.

Went to El Pollo Loco and got the $26.99 12 piece family chicken dinner meal for $20 with a coupon. It came with 3 large sides, 12 pieces of chicken and flour tortillas. The chicken was amazing as always. The sides were hot, fresh and quite tasteful. I would give the whole experience a 4.5 out of 5. I would give the food for the price also a 4.5 out of 5< /Review>

They really need to work on organization and cleanliness. We love the food but they have gotten our order wrong multiple times. We had to return the chicken because it was so hard and dry it wasn't edible. Customer service was really bad when we returned the food.< /text>

Waited for 45 minutes in the Drive-Thru Lane, when we finally got our food the order was wrong the food had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while and they forgot our plasticware  for our salads & meat so we ate  with a straw. Disappointed<//Review>

<Review>Been to this location 3 times and my chicken has been over cooked and nasty each time. This last time I inquired on how fresh the chicken was, the last first didn’t want to answer my question, then got rude when I asked again. I will not be back to this location and encourage others to go to the other locations and totally avoid this one.< /Review><rate>1<//rate>< user>

<text>Very friendly customer service, lines were longer than usual but the food was very fresh and delicious despite the wait.

My only gripe is that they forgot my drink, but being in a rush myself I didn't think to check. So hey, who's fault is it really?<//text><rating>4</rating></record>

Is there a reason why the drive through is so slow most of the time? I really wish the service were faster each time. Long, long wait times. People just get tired of waiting and leave.<//review>

Why is the drive thru always so slow. We literally waited 7 minutes just to get to the box to order. Drive thru is supposed to be faster and there were only 2 cars ahead of mine. Why does it take so much time to just take their order?< /text>

<Review>Honestly. This location is kinda not great. Ive given it three chances and every single time ive gone. Items are missing from my order and / or the order is wrong. Everytime ive pulled up its basically been hi what do you want. Ok ok move up. Sounding like they couldnt hate their life any more than they do and its annoying you showed up to order something. And if you come back around to ask for the salsa thats supposed to come with your order the the missing items you paid for but didnt get, you get passively treated like an inconvenience. Just my personal experiences with the times ive given it a shot. Been dissapointed every time.<//Review>< Pics>

It was ok customer service. Not the best but not bad; nobody rude or unfriendly just too busy to pay  too much attention. Lobby of course was empty but had drive thru customers.</Review>

Ordered a 10 piece meal for dinner through Uber Eats. The chicken was so hard, burned and old that I could not believe it had not been thrown out at least 4 hours prior to my order. Does not deserve 1 star.<//Text>

Airways great food. Drive through takes a bit longer due to no inside dining at this time. Love all the flavor of their chicken bowls.</review>

We were so pleased to go to Pollo Loco this last week and find the restaurant so clean and everything in order. I am confident that the manager reads our reviews and takes immediate actions in order to not lose his clientele.  Congratulations !

$12 for cheese enchiladas and rice. A frozen Amy's is better to be honest, and half the cost. I won't be back.... Just to set the record straight though, I'm not a meat eater so if you like meat, it may be a better experience for you.</review>

<review>The cashier was not friendly. There was no greeting & it seemed like it was a chore for her to do anything. The food was good. The restaurant was dirty, but that's their usual. Always seems they never have a clean table. I asked for a cloth to clean the table & was told they had to clean the table & she would tell the cashier. Mind you, I have my food & there is no clean table. I got a bunch of paper napkins & washed a table for me & my friend. Over 30 mins later the cashier comes walking by with a wet towel & washes off only 1 table. I'm sorry, that is just below standards. If they would get into the practice of keeping their tables clean & have friendlier staff, they would earn a 5 star cause their food really is delicious!!< /review>< user>

<text>Haven't been here in months they remodeled the interior and it looks great. Easy parking and access off Shaw. Staff were friendly, food was good, I had the 2 piece chicken meal.
Only negative thing I observed was there was a few tables were customers had eaten and left and no one from Pollo Loco staff was keeping up with wiping the tables clean for next customer.
I liked the remodel, made the older version of Pollo Loco look new and fresh.< /text><userid>102588032355109313372<//userid>< gmapID>

< Review>
I mean, ew. The whole place stinks when you walk in. I ordered at the drive thru speaker, and nobody was there. They seemed to have better things to do which considering the line consisted of just one car(me) was fair, sure.
I got up to the window and the lady there was a lot friendlier. She was patient, and suggested I take home an extra avocado sauce to try. She was pretty funny too, because we were cracking jokes while I waited for my order.
The food itself was bad though. The chicken was so horribly dry it was hard. The chips didn't taste right; they tasted like they'd been sitting in oil. The condiments they added(tomato, lettuce, sour cream) were in such a small amount of each it barely covered the center of the plate, and then there was a big helping of cheese surrounding everything. If it wasn't for the nice lady, I wouldn't have given any stars for that.< /Review>

Great place for delicious chicken!
Side dishes are delicious and the Salsa bar offers variety from mild to Fire hot.

< Review>
Ordered from catering menu the day before the event .  No one called me the day if to take my payment which is protocol. I called in and the manager on duty had not opened my order or prepared it. She promised she could make the 12 Noon delivery.  The driver went to the address on my credit card - my residence.  The clear instructions to deliver to my customer were ignored. I had to call in 3 more times. I was st my customers warehouse with 30 employees waiting for lunch.  The driver showed up 45 minutes late.  Customer livid. Total disaster and I paid for it.<//Review>

<text>I love the fire grilled flavor of their chicken.
I would give them 5 stars if they didn't run out of the cilantro dressing a few times already. Ranch dressing on their children salad just does not work. But other than that it's a 5 star place.< /text>< gmap_id>

<review>The food is good  here but I'm still not happy that the managers prepare food the with no hairnets . I decided to give it another chance to come back here due to last time which was a  year ago that I had a long black hair in my food. And imagine that the same lady gave me my food this time again.

< review>
I went to this location tonight and had a terrible experience with a rude check out clerk by the name of Crystal.  Her attitude made me lose my appetite.  I had made an combination order thinking that it included a drink.  When I noticed there was no drink, I simply asked for a diet coke, and the rude cash-out clerk by the name of Crystal, said NO!  WE CAN'T DO ADD ONS, in a very aggressive vocal tone.  She showed so much vile hate and rudeness, so much that it turned my stomach.

I drove home feeling sick and gave my El Pollo Loca food to my cat.   If only I'd known that this ill mannered character would be working, I would have gone to Pandas.  I'm a kind hearted All American Senior citizen and I didn't deserve to be treated so inhumanely. I pray that the manager send Crystal back to customer service orientation so she can learn how to treat and welcome good customers the proper way.  Bad attitude, Bad Manners, Bad Etiquette   : (< /review>

Great food , love the 500 calorie menu & the friendly service, Until I found a long black hair in my wrap 😩😤😡 When I asked the cashier (who had a braid & a hat along with the rest of the employees) to speak to the manager that's when the manager came off the assembly line for the burritos 🌯& wraps🌯 and she and her co-worker were the ones that had no hair nets or hats on & guess who had the long black hair 🤦?? So she wanted to make me a new one🌯 I said no thank you I will take my money back 🤑 and I appreciate your time. I will not be back until they start wearing either hair nets or hats👷 on the assembly line as well.<//review>

The customer service was good for that I give it 1.5 rate but, the chicken was raw except for the outside layer and some of the other chicken we had gotten was completely raw which I don't experience in other El Pollo Loco but different location the rest of the food was pretty fresh and good bits of the boiled broccoli were sort of rotten but in the end I enjoed it it's not the best but it's okay.<//review>

Foods good sometimes...the customer service at this location is horrible. On a recent visit they didn't have any chicken prepared so we had to wait 20 minutes and wasn't offered anything! At least a drink while we waited. The employees also don't seem motivated. The management really needs to step up their game at this location.<//text>

Good fast Mexican food that is generally flavorful and usually a coupon is available by mail or in your junk mail ads  to eat a meal for $5.00.   Love and must try the cilantro lime sauce they serve with the salads.<//Review>

< review>
I never ate at pollo loco i was at a shopping center close to it. But I have tried pollo loco 2 times in my life the 1st day they opened experiance 1 almost ended in hospital from food poisoning 2nd experiance 10 yr later 2nd time i ate it same as first i literally felt my stomach was going to explode went to dr and same food posining never ever went back. Same thing food is not good for my body thats why its called pollo loco it made me crazy runs.. I selected 1star by force because i would not give this place not even a dot.< /review>

Honestly the worst "El Pollo Loco" i have visited in appearances. the floors were dirty. the bathrooms were that of a highway gas station where drug addicts use. The workers keep talking street stuff and using alot of slang, while laughing loudly that customers and myself would turn to look at them to see if they could keep it down. They were not being professional. i bought  a 2 piece - breast and wing, they were too crispy, hard, and dried out looked like they been there for a long time. They were also all out of Avocado salsa and the pico de gallo and house salsa had nothing but green tomatoe.  This was by far the worst meal i had in your restaurants</text>
