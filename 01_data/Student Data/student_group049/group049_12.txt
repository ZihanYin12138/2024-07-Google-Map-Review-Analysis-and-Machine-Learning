<text>Chicken Korma Burrito has quickly become my favorite! Rich & flavorful! Generous portions are enough to slice in half, & enjoy for TWO meals! Check out their daily specials board too! It's located on the upper right wall.<//text>< time>

This was SO good, they were incredibly nice (helpful & really sweet bcz Idk sht about Indian food) and the wait times were awesome so that was wonderful. The food all on its own would have me come every single day if I lived close enough. They're all delicious, I wish I could order spicy ones I tried a couple different things I hadn't had and everything was fantastic.<//Text>

<review>I now have a new favorite Indian food place!”Indian Rasoi” translates to “Indian Kitchem”. It’s a small and simple place right on the newly revitalized, Ventura Avenue. The samosa channa, spinach paneer, jasmine rice with caraway seed and veggie korma, were all perfect! The portions were generous and the price was very affordable. The staff person was courteous and very helpful with my to go order. I will be back.</review><UserId.>100858528100151600090< /UserId.><username>Money Penny<//username><date>1626670390023< /date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I just ate here for the first time and I have to say it was one of the most satisfying meals I’ve ever had in Ventura County. Everything was flavorful and felt very clean and healthy. I am trying to save money by cooking at home but Indian Rasoi may have just thrown a wrench in my plan!<//Text>< name>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>Good food, had better but it's authentic for sure. Liked the desserts and drink options, I tried them all- I like the milk cakes, but it aint for everyone (im Asian, not picky with my food I prefer it simple, although I never hate on new things, I never let people claim authenticity on foods if its not fact). I am very analytical/specific with my foods.
Had the paneer(cheese) naan. Was shredded cheese, i was expecting melted so it could have been better. Curry and rice portions were perfect, I was full and satisfied with no it is off of one curry and rice. Didn't go spicy with my curry cuz I wanted to actually taste the flavors of the curry, so I cant account for how the spicier currys taste. Shared my dessert and drinks. Im very picky with my food places because there are so many places to try, so I would introduce someone to this place, but personally I would not go back.

Covid regulations-Must have mask, to go only (Idk about delivery) no sit down, 6 feet (less than 8 people in the shop at a time), you can order and stay inside to wait for food unless too many people come in at once then you must wait outside (they will either call you in or give you the food once ready) hand sanitatizer available.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80e9ad046498958f:0xae3984ecf733a711< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great food and fast friendly service.  Prices are excellent, and portions are generous and food always tastes freshly prepared, and nothing ever seems like it came from a freezer.  I eat here several times a week, and this is a great place run by a local family.  If you like Indian food, you will not be disappointed.</review>

Absolutely wonderful food served in a quick and casual counter service manner. Great veggie options and for Indian food the price point can't be beat. The staff at Indian Rasoi is warm, welcoming and care about the dishes they're serving as well as how your day is going. Definitely a welcomed flavor to the neighborhood.</Review>

<Text>Everything I’ve tried is premier delicious! A beautiful father-son team (at least when I’ve been there). Only 6-8 dishes in the steam tray (behind glass- they serve you) at one time, but who needs more? Pakora last night we’re the best I’ve ever had anywhere (and made fresh to order)! Samosa and naan also available. My favorite fish so far is the saag (or palak?) paneer. Bright, colorful and zingy! Enormous portions and great value! The only thing I’d like to see them do better is get their dishes and washing system down so there’s less reliance on disposable (but at least the ‘plate’ size take out is paper, not plastic). A really lovely business I hope will thrive!< /Text><resp>None< /resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

<Review>Was excited to try this new Indian spot. My wife and I had Chicken Tikka and Chicken Vindaloo. We thought both had excellent flavor. The garlic naan was solid. This is owned by a local family and fully deserves support of the community. My only wish was that the Tikka came with a bit more heat. That was not a concern with the vindaloo as that came with strong heat. Strong recommend.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80e9ad046498958f:0xae3984ecf733a711</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

These guys are amazing! As a woman having to buy car parts and deal with mechanics, I would say these guys made the experience so much easier. They helped me by providing me with a good car part without having to over pay. They also eased my worries when they gave me a 90 day warranty on the part they sold to me. They made me feel welcomed in their facility and made me feel comfortable about doing business with them. I definitely will call them again if need be in the future and I would recommend them to anyone searching for good used car parts. 10/10!!!< /text>

Found a very difficult to find differential for my BMW. And they had the diff ready for me the same day.. Woooo Hoooo. Price is spot on. Remember people you get what you pay for.. Prices are spot on, I would of payed a little bit more if I would of ordered it online. Not to mention also having to wait a couple weeks to receive it<//Text>

Excellent service and very friendly people here. I bought some parts for my Altima from these guys. And they went above and beyond to make sure I would get my parts after the yard closed. Thank you guys so much !!!! You have no idea how much you've helped me out. I will recommend you guys to family and friends.<//text>

Great service and good prices it’s not like other places where once they get the part for you, you have to buy it. They will Work with you and make sure it works before you take it. Good prices as well. Defiantly will go back if needed.< /review>

Rialto Auto and Truck Dismantler did an amazing job!!! I needed some bumper supports for an older Honda. They not only had the car but it was in amazing shape. They also pulled the part professionally. They presented the part for inspection after they pulled it. They were very friendly. I dealt with Ernie. As we were talking about cars I was working on, he mentioned they had 2 other cars as well. I got some super hard to find parts pulled for me. I would highly recommend this business. Ernie has a huge range of knowledge in many types of cars. JDM, muscle cars or trucks. They really do an amazing job there!!!</review>

This place is Awesome! Found and Purchased parts for my Cressida at a very low price ! Definitely coming back to this place and highly recommend this place to everyone looking for parts. Best part is costumers dont touch the cars and you can find small interior and exterior parts in almost perfect condition!< /text>

One morning my hood flew up while driving. I started to pray that I could find a hood that was the same color as my car. First google search I did this company came up. The Lord guided me here and thank God my prayers were answered. When I called the front desk guy (Eddie) was super nice 👍🏾 and even gave me a small discount just because I asked.  Once I got there they pretty much had the same car and color as mine and so I decided to get some extra parts. As my mother and I waited for parts we all ended up having a lot in common, offered me water because it was hot. Unfortunately the hood was too big for car and they offered to drop it off at the end of their shift which I was grateful. This place treats you like family. I definitely recommend this company and their service. It took me awhile to mk this review but I did it and I appreciate you guys‼️‼️‼️❤️💯 Thank you Eddie and Owner 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾</text>

Let me start off by saying their pricing is awesome but the best thing about this shop is their outstanding customer service. I will be coming back in case any of my cars need replacement parts. Make sure to call them or stop by before going anywhere else. I highly recommend Rialto Auto & Truck Dismantle to anyone.< /review>

<text>Needed a part that required 3 days shipping. I dont know about the rest of the world , but I sure dont have time to wait 3 days and I sure dont like my cars on stands for that long. Didnt try dealer because they overcharge for everything. Ran into a post on offer up asked a question and they were quick to respond. Staff is super friendly and have quick services. Parts were oem and fairly cheap. I would definitely recommend this spot! 2 thumbs up from me!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< gmapID>

Visiting from Northern California, this es the best self service car wash I've been to. Great location, clean bays, the brush was super suddsie. Just about everything was great. Possibly the best car wash in all of California.<//review>

< Review>
Great place to save a lot of money for a great car wash.
Are there bums that hang out by the seven 11? Yes. Have they ever bothered me? No. Have I ever seen single women washing their cars safely? Yes.
$5 credit card for 10 minutes.
1 min high pressure rinse
2 minutes clean tires(gun with brush)
2 min pre soak
2 min high pressure soap(will get off most stubborn bird poop)
1 min high pressure rinse
1 min uv wax
1 min spot free rinse</Review>

The 7-11 next to it is a bit dicey , but very clean , cheap. Anything over $2.50 just adds time, so it's nice to pay for what you need</Review>

<review>It's a decent coin-op car wash.  Plenty of pressure from the hoses and the vacuums have good suction.  The lot is a little on the small side so it probably gets pretty crowded on busy days.  I liked the fact that you could pay for your car wash with a credit card, dollar coins, quarters or bills.< /review><gmapID>0x80dd2087519cd1b3:0x79745e2d0ba646bd</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I come here to wash my car, its decently priced, and probably the cheaper/safer than a car wash. Personally I dint use their brush, since dirt may be on the brush and scratch my car. It seems shady at time, with homeless sitting around, but they dont really tend to bother or be an annoyance. Other than that it's a good place to get your car cleaned.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rating>

Spent $15 dollars on a nice wash, went thru the motions to clean the car. It comes time to use the vacuum. I pay for that start it up and boom! It starts spitting out dust out the top of it getting all over my car. And now my car I JUST washed is dirty again. Not cool.< /Text>

<Text>Honest establishment! The change machine took $.75 out of a bill I placed in it, so I left a note.

A few days later, I received a handwritten letter with excellent penmanship,  and with a full refund.  Based on that, the manager is obviously very cordial and caring to his/her customers. I can only assume it must be locally owned by good people.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>The good thing about it is that it takes credit cards, unlike many other self-serve car washes.  The bad thing is that it's quite expensive - $2.50 for 4 mins and $5 for 10 mins.  And if you don't keep feeding it, you have to start all over again.  There are cheaper car washes around.< /review>< Time>

It takes credit card, gives you a good amount of time and the brushes are really clean. And when you make a selection with the knob it actually gives you the selection. I was able to clean my big Nissan Xterra including a good tire scrub for the 1 charge.< /text>

< Review>
This feed store has all your furry and feathered friends needs. Get your dog groomed, buy some baby chicks, get your guinea pigs a new hut. They have friendly staff and there are enough people working that they can stop to discuss the pros and cons of dog food to help you select what you need. They also work to support local businesses like mandarin from a local grower in season and other small pet companies. I like shopping here because it has always been a positive experience and because I feel like my money is staying in my community.</Review>

I've been going to Douglas Feed & Pet Supply ( formerly Douglas Ranch Supply, still is DRS to me) for at least 27 years.  The new owner ( not that new) is great, in the past when a small item was left out of a delivery he personally  made sure a special trip was made to bring it to me quickly.

The whole staff there are friendly and knowledgeable.  Although they have added a great dog, cat & ?  store, I mainly deal with the original store for my horse, goats & chicks.  The staff there are great, helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.  The guys in the loading area are great also and when I get my alfalfa & feed delivered, the guys who come put everything where I want it, and are willing to move my old hay, etc., to put the new stuff where I need it, since as I get older I'm less able to do it all myself.  I really appreciate how helpful they are.

I highly recommend Douglas Ranch Supply.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Great friendly service. Good variety of dog food. And sounds like they take care of all animal dietary needs. I heard mention of crickets for food. I saw a hay pickup area, so I think horses and cows are taken care of here too. Pet friendly inside the store. They even have my buddy a treat.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>My mom has been shopping for her horse here for years. She always gets good service and has gotten PLENTY of hay and shavings here.

Our visit this trip was for a small bit of help from customer service and they were on it! They immediately rectified a tiny little problem we had.

There are plenty of free stores around but this one has great selection, great prices, great quality of items and super helpful staff.<//Text>< Pics>

I bring my “BIG, Bernese Mountain Dog”  girls in to use their dog wash. They are always so  friendly and accommodating! My girls are like bulls in a china shop! We have had less than friendly service elsewhere.... We LOVE this place! Thank you SO much!!!</Review>

This is my families favorite store, not just feed store. It's a family run business and all the staff are knowledgable and polite. They carry bags to your car and help you any way possible. We can get everything we need for our chickens, rabbits, cats, dogs and horses in one place.

The new grooming salon is amazing!< /text>

<text>Customer service here has been hit or miss. I’ve had some great “going out of their way” experiences. But unfortunately, most recently I had a very poor experience regarding how they handled a baby chick that died shortly after I brought her home. This was a chick I waited in line for over two hours, who they admitted when I bought had not been doing well, but they were sure had made a comeback. When I called to tell them she died, my “ask” was that they put one aside in their next shipment (happy to re-pay for it). The woman I spoke to was rude and cold regarding the whole situation. Very disappointing way to handle an unfortunate situation. Setting aside one chick out of a huge shipment is a small ask, to ensure a returning customer and the reputation of a small business.<//text>< pics>

I routinely shop at Douglas Fed & Pet Supply. Easy access, right off Douglas, plenty of parking & great prices. Wide variety of animal supplies and fed. Great customer service in all areas, they have main fed & supply store, a Tack & Riding supply store and Grooming! They even have a chicken nursary and supplies. Supplies for large animals/live stock to household pets, they have it available. Highly recommend.< /Text>

Clean place. Some items priced decently,  others are way too high. So compare prices unless in a bind. Sometimes those fetching/loading grain can be rude.</text>

This facility is top notch!!! They have separate buildings for different animal products, including an entire remodeled building for horse supplies, tack and gifts! Their prices are competitive and have quality feed and supplies. This business is an amazing supporter of local youth projects and 4-H. I truly try to not go to any other feed stores and only come here for the compassion and family atmosphere.< /Text>

<text>One of my favorite feed stores in town! Prices are fair, staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They have a great selection of poultry and supplies, as well as feed and bedding for your other pets. They even have people that help load up your car in case you buy a large amount.<//text>< pictures>

The employees are always helpful & informative in the pet & wash area. Bring a choke chain to secure your dog or ask  at the desk if you are going to wash your dog. I have purchased alfalfa for a friend's horse & decorative hay & cornstalks. All we're loaded for me. The store is owned by a locally. That's how I like to shop. Where my loyalty is appreciated.<//Text>

Wow! What a place! And the staff? Awesome as well!

I had found some feed in an online video and hunted it down. The only problem is that it came from a local supplier in the TX/NM area and so not available to me. Seeing as how I didn't know where else to start I just searched for a local feed store and Douglas Feed came up! So I emailed the site and waited.

It didn't take long before I recieved a detailed response from Craig. He and I bounced a few emails back and forth through the day clarifying my needs and what he could do to help.

Seeing how they are so close, I dropped in after work. Again, the staff were friendly and really look like they want to help. I ended up running I to Craig on site and we hashed out my needs.

I'll be picking up my purchases this weekend and moving ahead with my plans. Google asked for my opinion, and I'd give these guys 10 out of 10 if I could.< /text>

The owner, Craig truly cares for the community. He was very gracious to help with a fundraiser to raise funds for those in need a few weeks back. Then just yesterday I heard from my father, they have been helping with the animals of the fire, that it's been such a devastation but they are providing all efforts they can, going up and making deliveries and doing what they can to assist. After hearing this I knew I HAD to post and review. They care about the community and their staff has gotten better through the years, they used to be rude and short. Business has grown and continues on the right track. Support this local business. They care for those coming in and out.< /text>

<review>They never have anything in stock, the employees are always chit chatting and ignoring customers, I had to wait 5 minutes for someone to come to the register because they were talking about something in the back. And when they came to ring me up, they didnt even apologize for making me, or the other 3 people, wait. Not to mention, they have to enter your card number manually because their "system doesn't communicate with the the reader", so I look forward to credit card theft. This place is a joke.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x809ae1dea5b3f491:0x8af2474630a20a6d<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<userid>108844857352863293239< /userid><text>I have been a customer for about five years but have been very disappointed lately as their customer service has deteriorated dramatically.  On my last two visits, when I requested a 50lb bag of chicken feed, the clerk didn't even ask what type I wanted or discuss the options.  She just charged me for the most expensive one (or the one they needed to get rid of).  I had to request information about my options and she acted like this was an inconvenience.  Apparently, not just taking what they want to sell you is a problem.

After paying, I was sent to the "warehouse" to pick up my purchase but was forced to wait for nearly 10 minutes without an employee in sight.   I repeatedly rang the bell to summon an employee, as instructed, but got no response.  Even if they were busy, it would have been nice for somebody to come by and say "we'll be with you in a minute".  A couple of visits ago, the guy with red hair/red beard was merely unpleasant.  During my most recent visit, he was rude and argumentative.  I will not be returning.  I will drive further to shop elsewhere and avoid being treated like crap.  I suggest you do the same.< /text>< pics>

I love the dog wash! They have oatmeal dog shampoo & several other wonderful shampoos. The spaces are clean, and my dog always has a great time. I also noticed that the staff is always very friendly and informative.< /review>

It usually is always on point but today, a girl I've never seen before told us she'd help us after this guy. My daughter and I waited for 35 mins in the cold waiting to pick our chicks out....after that we started walking back and the same girl was standing outside on her phone. Looked at us and walked back inside!!so rude so we left w no chicks!!<//Text>

<review>Some times we need to call ahead to make sure they have the Avoderm dogfood we like in stock, but they have decent prices and have a very nice store. I think they had problems with their ordering system, the last two times we were in they were well stocked.

For our Chinchillas we buy wood pellet bedding and alfalfa cubes. The price on both is excellent. However they both come in 50 lb. sacks. For the bedding that is fine, We go through enough of it. For the alfalfa cubes, it's totally excessive. I wish they would just break down a bag and re-package it. I would pay the same price for just a couple pounds if it were convenient. We ended up repacking the cubes into freezer bags and giving as much away as possible to friends with Chinchillas.<//review>< pictures>

The best venue for any occasion!! Just ask for John, he's so nice! We held an amazing Pokémon GO PvP Competition here with about 500 people at the venue. It was professional and well-run! I highly recommend this ballroom for any event you might have,  wedding receptions,  dances,  and more!<//text>

Great venue with lots of space.  We were able to hold a Pokemon Go PvP tournament with over 300 participants!  I would recommend this location for large events, tournaments, weddings, etc.< /Text>

Really nice place for a wedding reception. The food was a little off but otherwise seems fine.< /Text>

John, the owner of this ballroom, was very kind to allow 400+ people in this place for a PVP tournament. Great location, great equipment, great space!</Text>

< Review>
The manager was very rude. Too many stairs to take our equipment up. (We are musicians) and are handicapped! They do not accomodate by having a service elevator, nor would they allow us to use the handicap lift. The lift hold s up to 600 lbs. And our equipment weights less than 300 lbs, this would have saved our backs. I WILL never go there again!<//Review>

<UserId.>107466004205008674695< /UserId.><Review>Don’t book your party at this venue. Owner, staff, security are extremely rude. It should of been a red flag when the owner went crazy on us. The owner allowed us to go days before to decorate and set up for a sweet 16. It was extremely hot outside and the inside of the ballroom was too. We asked if it would be this hot inside the day of the event. Owner comes in and starts yelling at us about how they were having a/c problems and were trying to fix it. He said he should just cancel our event since he knew we were going to be trouble. Many more things were said. Too long to list. Couple hours later comes back and starts talking like nothing ever happened.

Day of our event we booked from 6-12. By 11:35 security comes charging in to the Dj demanding that he shut if off. After confirming with someone he then said 11:45. 11:40 comes along and once again demands to shut it off. Dj starts putting his equipment down but still plays his closing song very low as he’s putting his equipment away. Now the bar tender comes and harasses the Dj to shut it down.

Staff is very unprofessional and would definitely not recommend this venue.

By the way a/c was working<//Review>< Resp>

lousy owner, disrespectful towards kids the youth, not professional at all, better take your party elsewhere, trust me

UPDATE: BAR TENDER LADY WAS SMOKING WEED OUT OF A WAX PEN

A DRIVE BY HAPPENED RIGHT OUTSIDE AND BAR TENDERS HAD NERVE TO MAKE JOKES OF IT

ALCOHOL IS BOUGHT FROM WITHIN THE PLACE, OWNERS LEECH OFF MORE MONEY DURING PARTY< /Text>

What a turnaround. I was going to give this place 1 star and drive off when Brady ran up to my window and said he was gonna take care of me now. I had an appointment for 9am and by 9:30 I was ready to leave. I asked one of the girls walking around if there was any chance my van would be done by 10:30. She said no.  Apparently there was some miscommunication in the front office and he more than made up for it with his dedication and effort to get my hitch installed. Thx for caring Brady 👊<//text>

For the most part a reasonable experience. However after returning the rental I was approached by an employee as I was leaving about my leaving the van where I had (I followed the signs placed by the business).
She questioned if I had returned it and paid (I had), and proceeded to berate me in tone and demeanor over my actions as a customer. The gentleman that had waited on me and inspected the van upon my returning it never once mentioned it's location I had parked.
I left the business with the impression that my patronage was not appreciated and informed the young lady who seemed intent on accusing me of being of nefarious character that I could very easily and without compunction no longer give them my business.</Text>

I don’t know where to begin so here it goes. Most of the employees there are rude except one that is nice and provides excellent customer service. The two times I been there I seen it all and it’s bad. If you guys don’t like working there get another job it’s that simple. Won’t be coming here again.<//review>

Takes 1 hour to rent a truck. My FitMovers are at Darrells waiting on the truck charging me 100 per hour for 4 guys.
Associates are taking drop offs making the wait time even longer.
Really wish this process was streamlined better.<//review>

I reserved a 26' box truck & scheduled it for 3:30pm pick up but on their end it showed 4pm (no big deal) I wait until 3:45pm & the truck shows up. Then the lady behind the counter looks into that truck's schedule & tells me it's scheduled to be taking out of state so I may not be able to rent it. I told her I was only going to need it for 3hours and that I would be returning it that same night & she was nice enough to let me take the truck. I returned at 7 right when they close, but there was staff outside cleaning trucks & they were kind enough to check me in. All in all I had a good experience, I am only giving it 4 stars because of the scheduling mix up. Also outside staff is very friendly & helpful. Lady behind the counter was helpful but she was kind of rude & she even yelled at her coworker in front of customers.<//Text>

I had been reading up on the reviews, I was wondering why people were giving them bad reviews. Well, now I know why. I dropped off my truck b4 the time. I went inside, and the girl behind the desk, I didn't get her name, but she is Hispanic told me to give the keys to one of the guys outside. I went outside and gave the keys to one of the guys. He did ask me to give him a few minutes. Well after he was done he told me to start it and open up the hood. He did tell me that he wasn't even supposed to get the keys from me. Well, what it boils down to is the workers that I dealt with this morning are very lazy. They want you to do the work for them. The best thing to do is drop it off after hours.< /review>

Slowest service I have ever received at at UHAUL facility. Only had one person working the counter during peak weekend pickup time. Additionally, the online check in which was supposed to minimize contact for COVID and speed up pick up neither minimized contact or sped up pick up. I might as well not checked in online.< /Text>

The lady that looks like a dude, I believe she’s manager. She’s very unprofessional. There was an older gentleman who had some problems with being over charged and she walked away and said to him “I’m not dealing with this” and told the employee next to her to handle it. She than asked myself what I needed I told her I needed to return the key and she simply said it’s in the box outside. I’ve never used Uhaul before so I wouldn’t know the process. She was extremely rude and no help at all. She than yelled at me because the other employee told me he’d do the return himself, and she seen him helping me and told me to leave that they’d send me an email. Did I get an email no, I was overcharged and had no idea until I checked my bank. Never again will I go to that Uhaul.<//text>

I rented a U-haul truck to move and was told I’d get the first month free for U-haul storage. How awesome is that?! This place is awesome! They have drive up access storage units, an office that sells everything you could possibly want for packing and the customer service is also outstanding! Plus remotes for easy gate access.

Other storage facilities say free first month, but then have hidden fees... U-haul doesn’t have this.

I’m so glad that I am with U-haul! 🙂</Text>

We too have had great service.
I very rarely have a perfect experience at any business.
At this U haul I've never had a negative moment, EVER !
If the equipment I want to rent is not there(only once) they will get it for me.
They always do all they can to be sure everything works perfectly on all any equipment I have rented, from small trailers to big box trucks.
They always rush outside and connect the trailer or whatever i'm renting.
EVEN IN THE RAIN !!!

Horrible customer service. Racist, prejudice worker asked my husband for extra items needed when it’s not even required. We have rented from Uhaul before and never had any problems. I can’t believe how my husband was treated. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!<//text>

<Review>We have had 2 things installed and the mechanic named Angel does a great job, but the problem is the staffing and management. We were quoted by the manager for a 30min job. We got there ahead of time and then the manager said that it would actually take 1hr 30min!!   IT TOOK 3hours and 30 MINUTES!!
We have 3 young kids and with a quote of 30min on a weekday we didn't bring another vehicle.  Not a single apology from the manager, who tried to avoid talking to us. The mechanic Angel was very apologetic, even though it was not his fault.
Very bad Manager and I wish I remembered his name.</Review>< pictures>

Made an appointment on Monday to have a trailer brake put on so I can pick up my new trailer... appointment was for Thursday at 8:30 AM...at 3pm on Wednesday a kid calls and asks if I can come in on Friday because he won’t be in on Thursday, when I explained that I set an appointment because I needed it done he said “well, I’m not going to be here”... he put me on hold and when he got back on the phone, he said for me to bring it in and leave it all day because “she will have to try to work it in”...? What’s the point of making an appointment? Now I have to scramble to try to have to find a place at the last minute...<//review>

<text>Waiting forever with an appointment... I can hear the employees talking about no help on when it's busy... but when the manger is working they have all the help... why don't you staff up on Saturdays so the line is not out the door... they just said they were going to bump us off because I was late but I was here waiting in line?

We called these stupid people in the morning to make sure they had a place to get propane, the girl says oh yeah we do. We get there and supposibly this guy says is been broken!. Bad customer service and communication among workers. My take on this is that this guy did not want to come outside to fill us up with propane cause it was hot. But who cares that's there job !</review>

I rented a truck only put 6 miles on it . After I was done using the vehicle I returned the vehicle and during the inspection she had taken pictures of previous dents of the vehicle and had told me she wasn't going to lose her job because of me . I had also purchased insurance so the vehicle was covered.She was accusing me of prior damage! Very rude and unprofessional!</review>

The manager Ryan Prince filled out paperwork to rent us a trailer that was returned a day early. He asked us to pay once it was all hooked up, which his assistant did and took about 20 minutes. After we waited in line 15 more minutes he told us that there was now a reservation and we could not use it and had his guy disconnect it.

We rent from u-haul once every couple of months but we will be taking our business somewhere else solely based on this incident.<//text>

This was not my 1st time getting service here but my experience was a little different from before. They were still the same respectful and professional. I upgraded on my services (oil change) I thought the oil change I chose was only 53.99. After paying for it and Signature being signed for me. The total was 59.99. Plus 1.99 for a Waste Disposal fee. I know a couple of people who have had the same services that did not have to pay that fee. It just make things a little weird. The price isn't the issue. I would like to know what I'm paying for and how much I'm paying before I actually agree to any services. Please don't sign my signature. It makes me feel like you're being sneaky. Is everyone getting the same treatment? I am really up in the air about going back there to receive services.<//Review>

They are super busy. I got there when they opened and it took over an hour. It was like this all month. I tried several times before and was told the wait was up to an hour and a half.  They need to hire back to their employee level that they had prior to COVID-19.< /Text>

<text>Normally when I go there, they will ask if you would like something to drink, not this time. They would also check your filter inside the vehicle, not this time. They would also lubricate the door jams, not this time. I think management has changed and not for the good or maybe because I was Just getting an oil change. Not happy since I've been going there for years. Hopefully they will have better customer service.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1606549632781, 'text': 'It looks like we missed the mark on delivering a great customer experience and we sincerely apologize.

They keep a record of your last service and make recommendations based on what your vehicle should have done at that point in time.

Also, there is an extremely low employee turnover rate in the oil service department.  That means something to me,  it builds trust.< /text><username>Dan Bernard<//username><time>1602013009665< /time></record>

{'time': 1576089094052, 'text': 'Jonathan,\nWe are very sorry our questions regarding services weren’t to your liking. This was your 3rd visit to our Madera Oilstop, and we appreciate that very much.  Our policy is to recommend services and products, based on mileage only, and to do it in a manner that is polite and respectful, should you decide Yes or No to the recommendation. Further, it is our policy to never pressure anyone into purchasing anything. A simple, No, on your part is all it takes for our staff to happily continue with the service.\n\nYes; we are a little more expensive than other oil change stations, but we believe the complimentary beverages, car wash, free top-offs between oil changes and our very thorough 33-Point inspection provide great value and are extras you won’t find anywhere else. But, we are sorry if your last visit wasn’t as excellent as your earlier visits, and we can only hope you’ll give us another chance to do it right!'}< /Response>

<rating>5<//rating><text>This is the place that takes the cake. Best place in town to get an oil change while you wait in the car. Now some may think it's cheesy but i like how they take the time to explain the most minute detail of the process. These young men are courteous, respectful, and have the greatest attitude.  They offer you a drink and if you been here before they call you by your name. Plus! Plus you get a free car wash coupon good for thirty days at buggy car wash next door. In these over priced times that's a good little bonus. I recommend to try them at least once and see for yourself.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Guys are nice. However, service is bad and overpriced. Always trying to sell you things you don’t need and will take advantage of girls who don’t know much. Not only that but wouldn’t accept their $10 off coupon that they provide on their website. Nor did they give me a “free” car wash that claims to come w the oil change.< /review>< Pictures>

Pretty good and fast service.  They offer a lot of extra things but they did catch my cabin filter which was filthy and my radiator cap that needed to be replaced.  A little extra but you get a car wash to go with it.</text>

This is a great place! They walked me through every step with an obvious servant heart! They were not only gracious about having me as customer, but also to one another!  This says a lot about the top-notch business they are running. Alex and Nick were super helpful and respectful! I was in and out in about 30 mins.</Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>I was directed to park behind a car being serviced.  I expected a little wait time.  I waited, waited, another car parked behind me and we continued to wait for almost an hour. When I complained the young man said they had an older van in the middle bay and they did not have an oil filter that would fit.....really?  Why not move the van until the part arrived?? When my turn came I asked for the most expensive synthetic oil change and three wiper blades for my Tahoe. They only had 2 front windshield blades available which I purchased.  When all was done I gave the man my card to pay the $97.65.  He returned without a service receipt and told me they were "out of paper".  This is the large printout that explains what was done, what was checked etc. ( I believe it is required by state law).  Next he handed me a 3" x 5" piece of paper for an "exterior" only car wash.  I told him I always had free interior and exterior washes with a full service.  He responded by telling me their "policy has changed".  I have been a returning customer for a long time.  My next and future service needs will be at Red Carpet in Fresno.</review>< gmap_id>

Went for an oil change. After I left two lights came on on my dash. Went right back they couldn't reset the lights so I took it to the dealership. There I was told my battery cables were messed with causing my truck's computer to reset. Toyota charged me $150 to reset the computer software. When I returned to Oulstop to give them the paperwork and notice from Toyota they refused to reimburse me. This happened at their location and instead they told me it wasn't their fault because it couldn't be "proved". The fact that I left the shop the lights came on and I turned around and went right back immediately to show them they still said it's not there problem. I won't be going back their. That oil change cost me $200 and all they would do is give me 50% off my next piece change... Yeah what a great compensation for messing my truck up! Terrible customer service as they wouldn't get back to me for over a week until I started calling them and requested the GMs number. He in turn refused to help as well. Never going back!< /review>

<Review>We moved to Elan 6-8 months ago and have been loving it so far.

During covid situation, they have been prompt with any maintenance work and they make sure it is immediately taken care of. They recently installed new blinds, installed new Nest, changed air filters. Maintenance team has been great at responding and taking care of tasks during designated time when we step out of the house.

The rooms are spacious and staff is friendly.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>The process went by so smoothly to move in! Everything was taken care of online and over the phone. I still went in to view the apartment myself, and it looks exactly like what I was shown with a few amazing upgrades! Upon move in any small repairs were taken care of immediately by the management team on site, and the entire complex looks amazing! If I see anything out of place (like a box left out by someone) within an hour it has been taken away/dealt with. You really won't regret moving in, all our neighbors are quiet and respectful. Never heard any loud noises at all. Every single one of my family members has commented about how amazing the complex looks overall and that the apartment itself looks beautiful. I'm looking forward to spending many happy years here!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

We moved to the Bay area from east coast a few days back and saw about 10-15 different apartments (all virtually), but Elan apartments representatives (especially Savannah Rangers) helped us the most to make our virtual tours and move in as smooth as it gets!
Another representative, Allan Carlos, helped me and my husband to move in our couch from one building to another! They didn't have to do this but they went above and beyond to help us, which we really appreciate. Their service requests also get addressed quickly!
Coming to the apartment, our unit has plenty of natural light and direct sunlight. The apartment is spacious with modern appliances in kitchen and bathrooms.
The community is very green which we love, has plenty of parking space and great facilities overall.
In short, we really recommend Elan apartments!<//Text>

We lived at Elan for a few years. This would have been a 5 star review, given our large apartment for great value, beautiful gardens surrounding the apartment complex, awesome pools and gym. I see a lot of people complained about the noise, and we indeed heard leaf blowers every day, but I believe that is inevitable in order to keep a property surrounded by trees clean.
The only reason I am giving 4 stars (and I honestly debated giving 3 stars instead), was that a month before our move-out date someone drew a swastika on the elevator door. I sent them an email explaining our concerns and asking what was being done to address the issue. Anthony told me he would forward my email to management, and said they would definitely be in touch regarding the issue. I never heard back from management about this, even after sending a follow-up to Anthony. They also sent an email to the entire community about “exterior guidelines”, as if drawing a swastika on an elevator door had the same impact as keeping shoes outside your door. The incident was not mentioned in that email, or any other email sent to the community. In the month we lived there after the fact, we did not see any additional security camera, and did not see any effort in trying to find out who was responsible for the drawing on the elevator door.
I completely understand that this was a difficult situation to deal with, but after spending wonderful years at Elan, we thought we could hold them to a higher standard. We were wrong.<//text>

We have lived at Elan for a few years now and are quite pleased with this community. The staff has always been responsive and delightful to work with, especially the resident services and maintenance teams.

Jennifer Bursch  & team helped us find the perfect apartment this month (We moved into a larger apartment within Elan itself). She was kind, listened to all our particular needs, and made apartment searching, lease transfer and documentation work seem like a breeze.  She was very kind in explaining to us the entire process and responded in timely fashion on all of our follow-up queries.

Overall --- 10/10, would recommend !!< /Review>

This review is specific to Johnny's maintenance work. Recently our washer sprung a leak, causing water to flow all over the floor and into the bathroom. Johnny was super responsive. He was fast to respond and came up with a quick workaround while he obtained a part. Johnny was totally professional and made a fix happen toot-sweet. Thanks, Johnny!< /Text>

One of the bedrooms got flooded from a storm due to the drain getting blocked and since it's a sliding door, the water leaked through the door and got into the room and damaged the carpet and parts of the wall.

The team at Elan (Rene, Matt, Robert, and Jorge) did a great job communicating and removing the carpet and replacing the place w/ new carpet and vinyl. Whole process took about a week but they were very courteous and professional. Appreciate the professionalism and smooth process.</review>

Johnny Villalobos is a great assistant service manager. He is very quick and thorough with his work. He fixed our concerns with the fridge, door hinge and screen door and helped us to understand details about the screen door.<//review>

I recently moved out of Elan due to a new job opportunity and I was dreading moving because I was on the 3rd floor and waited last minute to pack - so many different things came up and I was just super stressed! I was walking down taking a box over to the storage and had some questions about the move out process and saw Rene Bermudez SR the Service Manager. He must of saw the stress all over my face and he asked if I needed help. He explained the move out process and even helped me take some furniture apart to make my move easier!!! I was literally in tears!!! Things have been so difficult with my whole transition and he really went out of his way to help me. I would absolutely recommend Elan Village, not just for the pools and the ducks, but also for the excellent and thoughtful service Rene Bermudez provided for me!! I hope and pray my new place has someone like him there!!!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Very beautiful apartment complex with stunning tennis courts surrounded by water fountains :)
We had a major issue with no continuous hot water in all the showers and taps upon move-in . Multiple maintenance staff and engineers came to our apartment repeatedly to try and fix the issue. Special shout out to the manager Rene and his team of Johnny, Robert and Matt for continuous follow up on our numerous emails and calls and finally solving the issue . Looking forward to a wonderful stay!!</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1611961982993, 'text': 'Hi Akash! Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience.

<review>This review is for the moving in process specifically. Savannah made everything so simple and easy. With everything being a little different because of Covid, you do a self tour on your own. When I got there, Savannah had everything ready for me with all the important information, including the current deals. I ended up putting a deposit down that day and she made sure that all of my questions were answered and was available for any other questions I had.<//review>< Name>

<text>I have rented 2 different apartments in Elan for 3.5 years.
+ Safety, I never had something stolen and never saw any cars breaking in in garage as well as on street parking around. Car break-ins is very common case if you unhappy to choose Seely ave to park, but Elan's garage and streets looks quite safe. Neighbors are mostly Indian engineers and their families with good family atmosphere and specific nice appearance.

+ Staff, It's very friendly, I especially thank Dmitry who gave me lot of explanations about rental specifics and guided me when I decided to move from one unit to another.

+- Maintenance. I never had problems with maintenance. All work has been done it short time (usually same day If you come for help to 9am, and next day if you come during the day). Maintenance done for 3 years: Washing machine, fix, Microwave, replacement, Microwave plate, replacement, sink leakage, fixed, AC control unit, replaced, toilet clogging, fixed. Elevator is a curse. It is not working for months, it took about one month for full replacement, then brand new elevator stop working in first week of operation. Hope now it is working. However I think that fixing elevator is not under Elan's control.

+- Living area. Units are very dark, you always need to keep lights on. Also, I heard footsteps of my upper neighbors all the time, including 1,2,3 am. The solution is: you pay extra 100$ to rent and move to top floor unit, which is bright and quiet, that was I did.

-+ Pricing. Pricing itself is reasonable, I mean this is lowest price among competitors in this area. However, price policy could be better. When your 1-year contract is expired you will be treated as fresh new incomer in terms of price for next year. For Elan is seems does not  matter you have lived there for years and always pay in time. So, they are not making any attempts to attract existing good tenants to continue.

0 - amenities. Nothing to say, they are closed last year due to COVID.</text></record></dataset><record>

Johnny Villalobos came to our flat to help us in fixing the fridge leakage. He was so prompt and fixed the issue in 15 mins and while leaving he explained thoroughly about the issue so that next time we won’t be seeing the issue once again.</review>

Today Johnny came in to help us with our fridge. We had been having to throw food away due to the fridge over freezing everything. He came and fixed the problem right away!  Thanks Johnny and also shout out to the Elan team for doing a great job!<//Review>

Earlier my review was specifically for Dmitriy K who helped us in time of our need, but wanted to update my review to suit the move out process and experience living here.

We have been at Elan for 7 years and the only reason we did not want to move despite the smaller place and being expensive is because of layout of the building as well as the apartment. Elan does charge comparatively higher than the surrounding apartments per sq. foot area, but definitely worth it due to the service.

For 7 years we did not want to switch to another 1bdrm layout as well since we had a nice window next to the kitchen. The landscaping is amazing. Trees outside the bedroom as well as living room windows and balcony; very well ventilated and lit.

My original (and still worth mentioning) review for Dmitriy:
Dmitriy is an excellent asst. manager and listens to the issues and goes above and beyond his usual duties. My toddler lost the keys to the car at the grocery store and my wife couldn’t travel back since there was no car seat available or no ubers would allow passengers without car seats. When called into the leasing center, Dmitriy offered to drive all the way to the grocery store to help drive them back and help get them into the apartment. He even provided a spare key until we found the original ones and with a quick turn-around. We definitely didn’t expect him to do that, but was impressed.

Additionally, would like to give a few shout-outs for other staff members who definitely take their job seriously and go above and beyond:
1. Lilian (or Lily) from Leasing center: Lillian is definitely a great manager and understands the seriousness about the situations. She’s definitely an employee worth appreciating. I can’t go in details here, but definitely provided impeccable service.

2. Jose (from Maintenance): Jose always has been a great handy person. Very soft spoken, always ready to help and ready to follow up. There have been instances where we asked for something to be fixed, but forgot about the service request; he didn’t. He showed up at the door to fix minor issues. He was the very first and last person from the maintenance department who helped us.

3.  There are other few from the maintenance department who are very professional, soft spoken, lively and seems like they love their job: Benjamin, Mike, Jorge, Robert.

4. Theresa from Leasing: Last but not the least, Theresa’s always been very patient with all the questions and concerns. She would call back if she’s busy and cannot attend right away.

We miss Elan!

I know some people may not have the best experience and would be case by case basis, but Elan is definitely worth more in value as compared to other apartments around.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Elan at River Oaks may be an older community, but the grounds are beautiful. Its surrounded by huge redwood trees, and large water features that make you feel relaxed and at ease. Staff is extremely knowledgeable, and make the move in process effortless. Since moving in, I see the staff cleaning every single day! It’s a relief to know they are taking every precaution to ensure the safety of everyone. It’s clear I made the right choice when moving into Elan. Huge thank you to the staff, keep up the good work.< /Review>

<review>Located in the heart of Silicon Valley this is a great apartment complex in the South Bay. Living in Elan is truly like living in a resort. With tennis courts, 3 pools and 2 gyms we have all that we need literally right around the corner. We are walking distance from a small strip mall that has a Starbucks, Subway, Pizza, Curry Up Now and a few other restaurants. The apartment complex also allows food trucks to stop by so if you feel like eating out but don't feel like driving you can always walk to the food trucks that come by in the evenings. The apartment management staff are friendly and the maintenance staff is super prompt and friendly as well. Another great feature of this apartment complex is the abundant parking. Unlike other apartments (including our previous apartment) where parking is a problem for guests, we never have that issue as there is plenty of covered and uncovered parking for guests. One drawback of the buildings here are the thin walls which sometimes mean that we can hear our neighbors if they are loud or having a party. All buildings have elevators, shopping cart that you can drag from your car to your unit and what I like most about the design of the buildings is the uncovered passageways leading to and from our apartment. I like that the passages are not covered making the apartment complex look less like a hotel. Another feature that I like is the garbage chute on each floor. Not having to walk to a dumpster to throw my garbage means that I can throw my trash out every night which I really like. The apartments themselves are spacious and well designed. My husband and I currently rent a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom and it's perfect for the two of us. We especially enjoy the open kitchen with plenty of storage space and a separate den(dining room) It's also nice to have a balcony with a huge backyard (for people living on second floor) that allows me to maintain my gardening hobby. The apartment complex has barbeque pits too. In terms of location, Elan is close to 237, 880 and 101 so getting to other parts of the bay is really easy. It's also not too far from the light rail station that connects to downtown San Jose in the south and the Mountain View Caltrain station in the north. All in all a great place to live in the bay area! We have already decided on we'd move from this place only when we buy house of our own.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

We saw at least 20 different apartments before deciding on moving to Elan and we are extremely happy with our choice of the Elan at River Oaks community  and particularly our sunny apartment . The building is really clean, well maintained  and incredibly quiet. The shopping carts on parking lot is a huge bonus. The views from our apartment are spectacular (lakes, fountains, huge trees) it is quiet, very private.

The staff and front desk are extremely friendly and often go out of their way to help. We have not had any major maintenance problems in our apartment the past year, but maintenance requests completed very promptly,  the maintenance staff was efficient in fixing the minor problems we have had.

As former resident I can name all pros and cons:

Pros:
*  stuff is awesome and always have a great attitude
*  beautiful landscape with fountains and lakes (with lovely cute ducks)
*  plenty of  parking spots on two levels
*  shopping carts on parking
*  AC outlet on some parking spots (very easy to vacuum a car)
*  awesome gyms ( two of them are not crowded even in peak hours)
* washer and dryer in unit (actually on your patio! so you won't even hear the noise)
* free tennis lessons
* !!! MOVE - OUT PROCESS was very smooth and friendly. We've got whole our deposit back (except cleaning fee, which is very-very reasonable)

Cons:
- Not the newest building (but still great)
- Club house is accessible 9 am - 6 pm (not 24/7)
- After moving out you'll going to miss this community

Overall fantastic experience! Great place to live!< /text>

Very bad experience with maintenance. I am staying here at Elan, North san Jose. Our front door lock got stuck, we contacted maintenance. They never came to fix it for few days. We even went to there office but they did not respond properly and ignored. After 2 days the lock broke completely. It does not feel safe here as management do not take front lock door seriously. This is a safety concern.< /text>

<Text>Living in Elan is real satisfaction and joy. It's in zip 95134. Located near River oak plaza.

Elan has different 4 stories building surrounded by greenery.  On first floor of every building there is fountain, some trees and benches where you can sit and enjoy. Even its good area for kids to play. There is trash room too.

Two elevators plus stairs for every building.  Elan is gated community. It feels safe to live. Parking is also gated. They have ‘no car on road’ policy, so lot of space for guest parking. Its open. Mail boxes are near entrance. No need to go separately for checking mails. You can check whenever you enter.

Two Fitness centers are there fulfill with equipments. Three swimming pools, zacussi. Lot of fountains which increases ambiance of Elan. Two tennis courts which you can book for free.

One of the attractions of Elan is Ducks. Yes. Here are small lakes. You can see duks morning evening time. You can understand importance of ducks if you have a child.😀. Very good campus. Pet friendly. Smoke free. Just like everything you want.

Coming to individual apartment, they have provided amenities like, dish washer, washing machine,microwave,conventional oven, centralized AC etc. Variety of floor plans are available. Almost every apartment has patio. There is floor carpet for bed rooms and hall.

One thing I really liked about Elan is, leasing office staff. Very helpful and professional. You will never be disappointed. Even there is office closure for holidays or meeting,they will notify you always. Above leasing office there are indoor games to play. You can enjoy there.

Surrounding is very beautiful. River mark plaza is behind Elan. You will find many necessities there. Like starbucks, laundry, saloon, bank,some eateries etc.

I found Elan affordable among all the communities in 95134 zip as per my priorities.  You can compare prices.

Some things which can bother someone are,
Central AC. You may want seperate one. And wash room is inside bedroom for 1 bhk. That's it.

One more thing I forgot to mention is they celebrate all big festivals. Residents wil get some treat. Children will enjoy.

I don't know, why so much negative reviews and people are facing so much problems.

While moving, you must think of Elan. Affordable and fulfilled with amenities.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>Decent apartments but I have to agree that the noise is intolerable, especially now that we all need to work from home.  Multiple times a week there are leaf-blowers that stand in the complex courtyards in the mornings for literally two hours.  Usually it starts at 8am but occasionally earlier (which I believe is illegal) and even with all windows shut tight the noise is unrelenting with the echo in the courtyard.</Text>< rate>

This review is specifically for Daniel at the leasing office who went above and beyond to help us out. We needed to jump start our car and the towing company was taking a while with so many questions! We called the office to get that information and got Daniel on the other side. He was really polite and nice. He then offered to bring his own jump starting kit to come help us out and even showed up! But the tow truck was already there so we didn’t need him to help with it.

The next day, we were getting ready to leave, and the car wouldn’t start again! We called the office and got Daniel, and he showed up again to help us out!

Thank you Daniel! You are awesome!<//review>

Update:

I did have complaints about Pests and hot water issues but really appreciate how the leasing office and maintenance team has worked to help resolve it.

Seeing lots of pests and insects, including big beetles,  even though it has just been less than months stay. Very uncomfortable!!! Defintelt not worth the rent...< /Text>

I don't usually put reviews online, but i will add one for Elan apartments. My wife and I moved to Elan in north San Jose a year ago. The location has nice views and nature, but there are many problems with the complex that people needs to be aware.

1. Somehow people that don't live in the complex (strangers) get inside the buildings and request donations which is very scary when somebody is knocking in your door requesting money.

2. Noise, this complex is extremely noise every morning, every morning you will disturb with noises that will disturb, very hard to sleep in morning or work.

3. The apartments are very dark, the sun light can barely get inside, you will need to turn your lights in the morning to be able to see, which raise your electric bill in the top of paying utilities for water, trash, sewer + base rent, etc. It is a very expensive complex apartment.

4. The apartments are a bit small and very expensive for the area.< /Review>

<review>Lived here for one year.
Overall, leasing office employees are nice and friendly.
However, a lot others are not so good. trash bin are not managed well, often smells bad; always under construction/maintenance/cleaning,  so much noise/dust for a long time (more than 2 months); grill station is not managed well, always smell some gas leakage in early morning or late night, problem reported to leasing office, but no fix at all;  Bad apartment design, no sunshine in the room, always dark and make people feel depressed.
Not recommended for the price</review>< Pics>

I have been looking at apartments all weekend (rushing, as I'm visiting from out of town) and I was incredibly late to my appointment, and they still accommodated me and helped me see an apartment quickly and still were incredibly helpful and gracious. I loved the apartments themselves but the service from the front office was enough to make me choose living here. I want to give a shout out to Lily and Mikayla for going above and beyond!</text>

If you ever want to rent an apartment here, please avoid Liliana Huerta at all costs.

I've been living here for over one year, and recently I had a dispute with my ex roommates.

One day my ex roommates came to me because they wanted to stop renting with us after just two months of adding them to the lease contract.

I came to Liliana Huerta so that she can help me see my options but instead she forced me to sign the occupancy form to let my ex roommates go. Not only that but also made me responsible for paying them back the prorated rent of the days they were not living in the apartment.

I refused to pay that amount as it is against the lease agreement terms and got a small claim court order.  Liliana Huerta came as witness to this case and lied to the jury, stating that I was responsible to pay back the prorated rent. She shared information about my current lease contract, and  my work location without my authorization.

When I tried to file a complaint she refused to give me the contact of her manager. If someone has information on how to file my complaint please let me know.

I have been living a nightmare since that happened and cannot go to the lease office anymore because of fear of seeing her there.<//review>

I cannot recommend living here.  The surveillance cameras do not work and properties inside the gated parking garage get vandalized and stolen.  Gates are always broken so anyone from outside can just walk into the gated parking area.

Management does not care for any renter's property damages.  They'll say "make a police report and call your renter's insurance...there's nothing we can do".

They don't usually send emails out regarding property damages and/or stolen properties occuring on the property but emails are regularly sent out about unimportant matters.

My property was damaged and later stolen from inside the parking gate and nothing was done on management's part.  No one from management at all called me and asked what happened after my initial call to them.  It shows they do not care.

This place is always noisy with blowers so early in the morning 2-3 x a week.   If you wake up later in the morning the noise will be a problem for you.  The way the builings were designed, you'll have awful smells coming into your kitchen window from inside the building.  Elevator fan does not work and gets smelly most of the time.  The non-working cameras in the parking garages  are just for show.

Stay away from here and look elsewhere...<//Review>

We stopped by here looking for info on these apartments.  We asked a few questions and the staff were friendly and gave us some info.  We made an appointment for the next day at 9a.m. for a tour.  We were assigned to Mikalea to give us info on the community as well as a tour of the apartment we were interested in.

I have never been treated so rudely by an employee whose job it is to rent apartments and facilitate your move or association with her employers.  When we asked questions she said, you can look at our website.  When asking about rent increases, neighborhood (as there seem to be a ton of break ins at these apartments and security is an issue), we were met with coldness, rudeness and some of the fastest talking this side of the Mason-Dixon Line.  Mikalea was quick to shut down any questions with answers like, "I encourage you to read the lease", or "look on our website".  Who does that? and we are looking we don't have a lease.  On the previous day we were told the pools were heated, and as if by magic they were not heated the following day.

This was our 3rd tour of the weekend.  If you want friendlier, upfront staff, I suggest looking at the apartments around the Great Mall.  The pricing is the same, and we found the staff at numerous locations to be friendly and forthcoming about the property they represented.

I can see why this place gets so many bad reviews, unfriendly unhelpful staff....questionable security and apparently the staff don't know what amenities they have on site from day to day.  BE WARNED, read all the reviews.</review>

Only inconvenience has been ATT. They are new to the complex and their fiber internet is faster only in paper and are not responsive to service requests.

Don't loose your money on this apartment. Terrible place to live. Car theft and Missing parcels are pretty common. It'll hurt you living with worrisome everyday.

Overall this apartment is good in facilities, maintenance and floor plans. Rent also is the standard rate across San Jose area. I would rate them 5 stars for that without question.

But then when my lease expiry was due, rent was increased to around 200 dollars which forced me to move out and this community has a terrible move-out experience. I did not get my deposit back and on top of that that got charged 600 for stains on the carpet that went unnoticed during my move-in because they only were in a corner area of the bedroom. I do not believe that replacing a corner part of the carpet would cost that much and they would just charge me whole carpet replacement fee because I ignored it during my move-in.

So my advise to all moving in to this community: Be extra careful when moving-in and do not ignore anything even if you think it won`t be an issue for you or you are okay with it. Have a record of every minor detail because the management there will try to charge for full replacement/repair for anything you missed on the move-out<//Text>

<review>Avoid talking to front office guy Hitesh at any cost, first he thinks he completed PhD and doing part time job here as social service. He just wont stop at getting you bad deal but will deny all offers you might qualify like low deposit or free month.   Better talk to manager's for best deals if all you u want to stay at this apartment.

Good part of this place is its spacious outside, but the space inside apartment is not well utilized, 780sq feet on this apartment is equal to 630 in newly built one.

Oh yes, you might loose your car or you'd see gates being broken, the dumb garage opener will not work or your fob for gates, those can be fixed with multiple trips to leasing office.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808fc969e7708f27:0xe087b01e9fcc4a2e< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>I found that the Apartment complex was nice and generally well maintained except the elevator in Building 5.  I left after a year when they increased my rent by 6.5%.  It is a nice place, but not that nice.

I caused very minimal damage while renting, but they keep your security deposit to cover shampooing the rugs and repainting.  During the move-out they told me that they would charge me for shampooing whether or not I shampooed it myself.  Not a big deal, but they didn't point that out when I was signing up.

The most frustrating thing about Elan is that they treat their tenants as deadbeats.  They use an external service to collect payments for shared utilities like trash and sewer.  The tone of these bills is very aggressive. As someone who always paid my rent on time and prides myself on a very good credit rating, I found it frustrating to have the final $124 bill (for painting) referred for collections on Jan 15 even though they cashed the check on December 24.  Again, not a big deal, but another snapshot of how they treat their tenants.

I am not recommending that you don't rent from them, but go in with your eyes open.< /Text>< Time>

<text>Way over priced. What type of a salary should a father make to support his wife and kids in this area? A doctor or Lawyer?? Wow, this is why California is becoming the most expensive state with a high poverty level state with a minimum wage of $11 does not match the amount of rent that needs to be paid here. Horrible. It will take them 50 years to make the money back instead of 10 years if they lowered the rent to a realistic amount.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Spacious apartment with patio, ample parking ( its not reserved, you could easily find one for your guest) good amenities- accessible swimming pool, gym, tennis court, gaming room (I don’t like the fact that we can use it only during office hours for free)

Water leakages in parking ( thankfully not on cars). Elevator stops working many times and they take very long time to fix it (once it was down for 3 months)< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Car theft, car break-ins, missing parcels is a common things. Just google news about this community and you'll have enough things to consider before signing the lease. Apartments are small.</review>

There's probably worse places to live, but for the price, I doubt it.  After 3 years and a total of a 26% increase in rent, we left.  The elevators are constantly breaking down; I mean monthly in each building, with people regularly getting stuck in them.  Several times we received reports that the emergency buttons didn't even work in the situation.  They went 2 years without certifying them between 2013 and 2015.  I'm not sure how that is legal.  We had theft issues every year we lived there, and a total of $43,000 was stolen from us during our residency.  Among household items and jewelry, I had two motorcycles stolen and 1 more vandalized within 3 months less than a year ago.  I don't understand the comments about attentive management.   My experience is that they were always changing, and they were focused on money, not resident satisfaction.  It was fruitless to try to negotiate with them.  The regular office staff was friendly, and Maintenance was reasonably responsive, but the fixes were not high quality.  We had to call them back multiple times for each issue we've raised.  Issues like the washing machine leaking, or handle falling off the kitchen sink.  The cable/Internet is notoriously bad, and we ended up resetting our modem once a day, just to keep Netflix from freezing; that was our only usage, so it's not like we were running a server.  I give it two stars because the parking is good (if not secure), there didn't seem to be roach issues while we there, and the pools weren't usually crowded, although they are only heated for 4 months.  Otherwise, you can find much better deals (nicer, newer, better amenities, cheaper) elsewhere in the same area.</Review>

<text>It’s upscale area and u’ll know when u pay he rent you paid for it.

But the apt as such isn’t secure, many car thefts/breaks and most recently a homicide. And most of all zero help when you report any such inside to Office.

The system is so outdated you cannot update ur mobile number to open gate unless number starts with 408( that’s how outdated they are). After all hefty rents you’d still pay extra for using their online rent payment (such misers).</text><rate>1</rate>< user_name>

The soft top of my convertible car was vandalized in Feb. 2015 at the gated underground parking lot of Elan At River Oaks Apartments. It costed more than $2000 dollars to fix the vandalized soft top. I talked with the management team of Elan At River Oaks Apartments  multiple times about improving the security of their parking lots and urged them to install cameras. But Elan management is unresponsive about the vandalism incidents happened at their parking lots and has done nothing to improve the security of their parking lots. Elan management does not share any cost of fixing the vandalized soft top of my car. I am deeply concerned about my car when parking it in the Elan parking lot and concerned about the security of the Elan apartments in general.<//Text>

The only thing i don't understand is that they don't allow kids in the club house or play room upstairs the lobby even a 14 year old can go there because they think where gonna damage there property. and why would a 14 or 15 year old be supervise? like come on now there grown up teens and can supervise them self. Don't you guys want others to have fun or enjoy in the club house? im sure all the kids that lives in Elan apartments enjoy playing in the club house. But now you guys have a new rule that kids and teens need to be supervise in the club house with is unfortunate. Like how a grown up teen would damage the properties they should know how to take care of it.</review>

If you have kids or planning to have kids - this is the wrong place and too dangerous for your and your kids health. The management is too lenient with the smoking violators and also allow smoking in patios and no notices informing residents of their smoke limits.

A neighbor throws cigarette buds outside his door and outside his patio all the time.

The two stars are for the polite and friendly management. I can't say the same for the inconsiderate chain smokers.< /review>< Date>

<text>All the reviews (good and bad) are true. However, I personally love this place. I love the tall pine trees. the open hallways, vaulted ceiling, the patio, our apartment was spacious 1090 sq. Ft compared to the neighboring more expensive apartment complex, theirs were definitely smaller. the pools are nice with hot tubs, the gym (could be better and bigger) ample parking, I didn’t have to worry about where to park. And it was the cheapest in the area 4 yrs ago. The office staff are friendly, Hitesh is actually a nice guy. The service staff are also very nice people. Their supervisor is also super nice! The only reason why we’re leaving because of the ridiculous rent increase. It was no longer practical. It was time for us to get a house. In our 4 yrs in Elan we never had break-ins and that part is worrisome. But we never leave anything in the car not even a book or an empty plastic bag. The HVAC is a problem. It doesn’t work on extreme temperatures. There were hot summers and cold winters. We had to buy Costco heating fans so we could sleep ok at night. The previous shooting was not a random home invasion. It was targeted and the police caught the guy with the help of security camera that was installed in 2016. So it’s up to you what is acceptable and what is not. For us, we were ok with it. We were able to save money. We have good memories here.<//text>< Pictures>

Well, what can I say about this place? I moved in here in March and complaint to manager "A" about the noise that I've been hearing almost every day in May, he told me to wear ear buds. Well, I didn't get what I need then, I wrote a bad review on Yelp, that's when the social median Andrew from yelp introduced me to assistant manager "I". Well, she helped to call the couple who lived above me, and they didn't care how others think. Continuously doing what they've been doing. I kept a record about the noise, when, what kind of noise(s) that I can hear, I even recorded the sound in my phone during different times. "I" didn't even want to hear, she was not interested at all!

I brought all of my approves to the office to see the assistant manager "I", she basically told me 2 options:
1. Live UNHAPPILY until my lease end!
2. Pay early determination fee!

Wow!~~What a great problem solving team in Elan! Called in May,solution to me: wear ear buds! Things kept going like a snow ball,and I only get 2 options after their investigation!! They are too busy to just make time to your house to listen. If you are too busy then I can record the sound for you, but I guess not good enough.

If you have a responsive neighbor(s) who live(s) next to you or above you, who doesn't slang the glass slide doors, doesn't pound instead walk in the house, who doesn't cook, cut food, run dishwasher, and wash cloths  at 11:00-1:00 at freaking mid night everyday, then lucky you!

See it yourself! If you need more inside about this place, please do write me and I will reply to you on Yelp, I actually heard more about this kind of stories from other tenant as well.

Do not recommend this place at all!

Solve your own problem! This is the conclusion I get from this place. Thank you for the lesson and I will! I will use my word of mouth to tell people how I feel about this place. If necessary I will report them to BBB.Well, what can I say about this place?

If you have a responsive neighbor(s) who live(s) next to you or above you, who doesn't slang the glass slide doors, doesn't pound instead walk in the house, who doesn't cook, cut food, run dishwasher, and wash cloths  at 11:00-1:00 at freaking mid night everyday, then lucky you!

See it yourself! If you need more inside about this place, please do write me and I will reply to you on Yelp, I actually heard more about this kind of stories from other tenant as well.

Do not recommend this place at all!

Solve your own problem! This is the conclusion I get from this place. Thank you for the lesson and I will! I will use my word of mouth to tell people how I feel about this place. If necessary I will report them to BBB.< /text>

<Text>Well, what can I say about this place? I moved in here in March and complaint to manager "A" about the noise that I've been hearing almost every day in May, he told me to wear ear buds. Well, I didn't get what I need then, I wrote a bad review on Yelp, that's when the social median Andrew from yelp introduced me to assistant manager "I". Well, she helped to call the couple who lived above me, and they didn't care how others think. Continuously doing what they've been doing. I kept a record about the noise, when, what kind of noise(s) that I can hear, I even recorded the sound in my phone during different times. "I" didn't even want to hear, she was not interested at all!

I brought all of my approves to the office to see the assistant manager "I", she basically told me 2 options:
1. Live UNHAPPILY until my lease end!
2. Pay early determination fee!

Pros: The management team there was great and very responsive. The amenities are kept in good condition, and the apartments are easy to live in.

Cons: If you're just visiting them, you may get there on a normal day without the infamous Milpitas stink. This was my experience in November 2014, as I had two weeks to relocate to the Bay Area and sought a place near work. The issue, though, is that on specific days one of the worst smells you can imagine travels from the nearby Milpitas dump directly over this space. It is disgusting and miserable to be outside. It will not be mentioned in your visit.

Apart from that, it's not in a walkable part of town. There is a nearby Hobee's and Starbucks that were great to visit, and Paxti's is still walking distance. Without the stink, it's far from a bad place to live, but the smell made it an unlivable situation. For what you're paying in the Bay Area, find a place you won't be disgusted to come home to.< /Review>

If you are considering this please, I have one suggestion : NEVER !
This place is NOT at all secure ! Car thefts, bike thefts, break ins are daily activities here with aboslutely NO action from the management. There are junkies living in the parking lot at night !

Poor maintenance of swimming pool & gym . You will never see the spa working !

Your mail and packages goes missing all the time ! Is it the residents or the junkies in the parking lot ? No idea !

I am going to leave this place very soon, I regret signing the lease !< /Text>

Please be assured that our team takes security very seriously and works diligently to provide a safe environment for our residents. If you have experienced theft, please do not hesitate to report it. We will be happy to work with you and the authorities in resolving the issue. We also understand your frustration with our mailing service.

<text>I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMMUNITY.

STAFF IS NOT COURTEOUS AND DISRESPECTFUL STAFF.
Staff Lies on every thing,
Apartment Carpets are Dirty, with Cigarette Holes,
Heating and AC does not work for weeks.

Make sure you document everything. .</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

the professionalism of every person on Dr. Shelby's staff from the appointment scheduler to the receptionist to each member of the medical team was outstanding. I came for an 11:30 procedure and was on my way home a little after 1 pm. Among other things that shows me they valued my time as much as their own.
I would rate this experience as 5* in all respects.</Text>

The facility was five star but my interaction with Dr. Shelby not so much. I only met him in the in the surgery room as he popped his head over to introduce himself seconds before I was sedated. Then I never saw him again. No update on how it went with the procedure after I woke up. The nurse had me get dressed and go to the waiting room to meet my ride. No wheelchair or escort out despite feeling wobbly after the sedation. Great facility, quick in and out, but the human component was a disappointment.<//Review>

A++ in all aspects!  I had a colonoscopy and every person on his team from pre-op to post-op couldn’t have been nicer.  They were all very knowledgeable and informative as was Dr Shelby himself.  Excellent bedside manner and explained everything that went on during the procedure and answered all of my questions.< /text>

No follow ups at all and he doesn't want to see you at all --only does video calls which he calls late.
My son had C DIFF and he did not even call us to prescribe any antibiotic!!
My son suffered and had a delayed in treatment and had to see another doctor.
I am a nurse do I know the medical field
I should have NEVER bought my son to see Dr Shelby!!!
Dr Shelby only wants your money and does not care about you as his patient!!!
Be warned!! Do not see Dr Shelby!!😠😰😱</text><time>1614412004932< /time></record>

<review>I had a colonoscopy this morning.  Dr. Shelby and his staff were fabulous.  The facilities were clean and orderly.

I was in and out in an hour and 15 minutes.

AND the anesthetic wore off very quickly so they have figured out how to use the correct dosage so I didn't have to waste any of my remaining day.

The pre-warmed blanket was a welcome and thoughtful touch.

Yes - I could not be happier with the service I received.</review>< pictures>

No one looks forward to having a colonoscopy, but Dr. Shelby and his staff make the experience as easy as possible. When I was discussing the "prep" which is the most difficutl part with his staff, I mentioned that I did not like jello. The staff member advised me that many people found jello to be helpful during the prep, so I bought some and made it up. She was right. having something solid made the all liquid diet much easier.
Dr. Shelby's group is very efficient from the time I arrived for my colonoscopy until the time I left was only 45 minutes. The cleanout wasn't pleasant, but other than that it was not bad.</Text>

This office was unprofessional, and not clean.
I do not think his name was Shelby either.
His name is Ali Shahabi and cheats people. Beware. He overcharges you and will max out your insurance. Be careful to not be cheated.
There are much better doctors in Dan Ramon who care about medicine and not money.<//review>

I have been a patient of Dr Shelby for about 15 years and have had several colonoscopies and other medical procedures. They are simply the best group of professionals in their field of medicine. I would highly recommend them!< /review>

But I have objection regarding billing. I was not correctly told about the cost of the procedure properly. I clearly asked them about the whole cost of the procedure. They misinformed me about the bill which was ~$200. But I have already paid more than $600/$700. Also Since 2019, I have been receiving lots of medical bills from Labs associated with the procedure which I had no idea.

I really wish, I did not visited this facility and took a simple treatment whose bill is haunting me henceforth.</text></record></dataset><record>

<response>None</response><Review>The visit was organized and efficient. Possibly somewhat too efficient. There was a 20-30 minutes wait, followed by efficient set-up for the procedure. Very quick hello with anesthesiologist and out for the procedure. I was told it took about 15 minutes. Afterwards, told to see near exit door and Dr. Shelby made a very fast appearance and to quickly usher us out. As patient, felt pressured to leave quickly. As few more minutes to explain the results, possibly in a small office would have been better.< /Review></record>

Dr. Shelby’s GI surgical suite is very comfortable, great staff and great location. I’ve had several procedures there and felt well taken care of and was finished in a very timely fashion. Dr. Shelby is a kind, understanding and very competent doctor. If you need to do procedures that he does this is the place to come!<//Text>

“I cannot begin to express my satisfaction with the staff at the Executive Surgery Center where I had an endoscopy procedure last June 8, 2017.  From the front desk, to the nurses, and the doctor; each and every one of them was courteous, professional, and made my visit as comfortable as they possibly could.
Dr Shelby is a very busy doctor
but still took the time to make me feel like I was the only patient there.
Adam, the gentleman who took my initial information was terrific, he too made me feel like I was the first patient of the day.
Glenda, a lovely lady who set me up in my cubicle was very professional, very comforting, patiently answered all my questions and made me feel really cared for.
Top- notch facility, very clean, and has a welcoming and positive atmosphere for patients.
What a wonderful group of caring and kindhearted professionals! I feel very blessed to have been served by all of you. May God bless you all with His kindness in return.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!<//Text>

I just did a procedure done at Dr. Shelby's facility.
Definitely reminded me of the procedures done in 3rd world countries.
Like machine. With no human connection and Least explanations.
My feet was very uncomfortable and out of the bed. ( the surgery bed was too short that my feet was out and uncomfortable) no one asked me anything or checked on me to see if I am comfortable or not.
The explanation before procedure (the day before and preparation) was so insufficient that I started having so much problem after taking one bottle of liquid that they prescribed to make my stomach empty and not being able to finish it I was not aware if I actually am going to have the procedure done or not after all. No contact point to ask questions or if there was a problem.
I have done procedures before that they put me on sleep and I wake up all fresh and rested. Nothing close to that. I was  awake after procedure. (I was looking to have a bit of restful day, after all the diarrhea situation the day before, but it was not the case. And the last thing that was upsetting to me, my underwear was half way down and they didn't bother to put it back how it was before the procedure started. I felt uncomfortable waking up to half way down underwear. Unpleasant experience of the procedure. I do not know much about the doctor Shelby.
I did not like machine like, low service and low quality facility with not much caring staff.< /Text>

I have seen Dr. Shelby numerous times and he is always very kind and good at his job. I don’t always feel that the communication is great with his office staff and that many times things are not explained well. But that is my only complaint.  I would continue to recommend this doctor as  he genuinely cares about his patients and their well-being, and goes above and beyond to achieve good customer service.</review>

Unfortunately, dealing  with Dr Shelby and his schedule/insurance people prior to procedure was less than pleasant.  They were dismissive, didn't listen, and in the case of the woman scheduling, just plain rude.  When it came time to discuss my payment for the two procedures, they were very annoyed by my request to understand the cost breakdown between procedures.  Ironically, the "follow up" email(s) I've received was not to provide info on my procedure results, but to give a Google review. Fortunately, it doesn't appear there are any complications requiring me to return to Dr Shelby's practice - next time I need GI care, I will definitely go elsewhere.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Everyone and everything about my experience was the best I have experienced in this type of procedure. The only reason I gave a four star review, instead of five, was because of the lady who "helped" me when I first was shown to my room and when I saw her again to leave. I was not given, let alone explained, the discharge instructions. My pick-up driver, as well as I, was shocked when she pointed towards the exit door without offering any directions or alternatives when my driver said she was parked on the other side of the building. I sort of staggered out to the car without help. Everyone else in the process showed much concern and care.< /Review>

<Review>From first consultation to checking out after my procedure the experience was comfortable! I was treated with dignity and kindness from every person I encountered. If you are putting this off due to any fears, this organization will set you at ease! The peace of mind you have afterwards is well worth the small amount of discomfort while fasting! Call Dr Shelby's office now - you will be happy you did!!< /Review><username>Melody Regas-Mosier</username>< userid>

Dr Shelby is by far the most competent and compassionate gastroenterologist I know. Meeting with him for an intake was excellent - he provided relevant and helpful guidance and support for my condition. The procedure I had performed went without a hitch, and I was in and out of the clinic in just about an hour, with no adverse effects (even no sedation from the anesthesia!). Post the procedure, he gave me my preliminary results and then scheduled a follow-up within the following fe weeks. Overall I feel great about the entire experience and his knowledge about my condition. I would highly recommend Dr. Shelby and his clinic for any of your GI problems!< /Text>

<Text>Love Dr.Shelby he is always so kind and caring! The facility was nice and clean, the front desk lady was very pleasant, the nurse was very nice and very good with the IV one shot and he had it in no pain at all!  I  got there 20 minutes early so at 10:10 AM was taken in by 10:20 AM and was  dressed and out of there by 11:20 AM. That was with an endoscopy and a colonoscopy. I would definitely recommend this doctor and this facility!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Pre-procedure introduction with Dr. Salim was very informative.
I was uncomfortable and nervous day of procedures and the team was very encouraging and supportive  all the while staying professional.
I feel confident about the staff and their expertise and will come back for future procedures.</review>

I dreaded the need to have my second colonoscopy.  My first one, in Southern California, was 12 years ago. It's unpleasantness is seared in my memory.  The prep for this colonoscopy was extremely unpleasant again this time.  The colonoscopy however, with Dr.Shelby, was surprisingly easy. The staff at the clinic were comforting, efficient and professional.  Dr. Shelby and the anesthesiologist were kind and reassuring.  The whole procedure was quick and easy.  I would definitely recommend Dr. Shelby and his staff to my friends and family.</text>

<Text>Dr. Shelby is delightful and caring about your healthcare.  Colonoscopy is still a horrible prep work but a very important screening to have.  His facility is a well oiled machine.  It is over before you know it.  This is my third colonoscopy with Dr. Shelby over the last decade.  I highly recommend Dr. Shelby and this facility.</Text><Date>1554532517005<//Date>< rating>

I highly recommend Dr. Shelby for colonoscopy.  He is very warm and reassuring. The office staff is very efficent and made sure that I understood the prep.  The surgical center was well staffed and comfortable: Every medical professional introduced themselves , told me what they were going to do and asked if I had questions.  The procedure itself was like a very pleasant 20-minute nap. Soon after I awoke the doctor came in to tell me what he'd found.   All so much easier than I expected. 5 stars.< /Text>

I'm a new patient, having had my first colonoscopy the first week of January 2017.  Dr. Shelby and his staff from the initial appointment through the procedure are extremely professional and polite, forthcoming with information, open to questions and discussion.  Each step from the initial consultation through to the end of the procedure and follow-up was explained in detail and expectations were set and explained.  I highly recommend Dr. Shelby and his staff!< /text>

<user_name>Unsa Sahato<//user_name><review>The first time i called the office to make the appointment, before even providing my insurance information i was told they have all my information with them already. Then i asked them to please verify if this office or the further proceduers are covered they didnt respond properly and told me you should be covered its all good.
Later i called them again and asked them how much Endoscopy would be charged and they told me $500. After checking this couple of times, i went to get my endoscopy done but now im charged with $4000 bill and have been told i was out of network seriously! that is not acceptable. Now im stuck with a huge bill on my head because of their negligence .<//review><rating>1< /rating><Response>None</Response>< UserId.>

Dr. Shelby Salim has been my doctor for over ten years and I have been extremely satisfied with his professionalism in the way he treats his patients.  He listens and appropriately responds to any health issues that I may have.  Recently when I had a colonoscopy, I was very impressed that the procedure started on time and the overall experience wasn''t bad given what that procedure entails.  I feel bless having him as my doctor and I would recommend him to anyone without hesitation.<//Review>

<text>I am a new patient and I am, so far, completely and totally satisfied with him and his office staff’s  competence. They don’t seem to waist time and bring you in for extra appointments “just to see how things go”. Dr Shelby got right to the point on my very first visit and had me in two days later for a colonoscopy. He is very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. He isn’t a “let’s sit around and chat about your private business” but he is a no bs kind of doctor and I appreciate that about him. You can’t find that anywhere these days. He doesn’t prescribe stuff you don’t need and that’s even better. My previous GI Dr’s PA sent me home with Miralax when it wasn’t even the problem. Dr Shelby knew right away that it was the wrong thing to give me. No matter what happens, I appreciate his honesty and expeditiousness with my health issues. I highly recommend him and already have to my friends and clients.< /text>< Pictures>

There is nothing I can say or do to make Dr.Shelby or his staff any better. This group makes you comfortable from the time you walk in the door until you walk back out and their follow up and concern makes you know that you are in good hands.<//Review>

I liked dr shellby when I used to go in get a colonoscopy,endoscopy and things were good, but if you have a problem he never but never calls you back! You can be in horrible pain, I’ve called for days, he never called back,nor did his office. He just likes to do procedures get his money, but has absolutely no bedside manner and truthfully he is a horrible doctor,never talking to his patients!!! What a difference, I am now seeing Dr.Gil and he is incredible,calls back immediately with any questions, actually talking to you!!!! Dr. Shellby doesn’t care for his patients at all !!!!< /Text>

<review>It was OK, but I thought they kind of rushed me in/out, even though they were late & made me wait for my few appointments with them. Mediocre overall, and didn't love feeling like I was on a manufacturing line.< /review>< pics>

<Time>1538154337581< /Time><Review>I am Chitra Jagannath.
I had a Upper GI  Endoscopy, at the Executive Surgery Centre in Danville on the 20th of Sept 2018 at 0630 AM.
The checking in procedure was very smooth as the staff at the checkin desk was very courteous and pleasant.
The nursing staff were very helpful in answering my doubts. Dr.Shelby explained the procedure and after the procedure told me that everything looked normal, and asked to see him in a weeks time to assess the next course of action. Dr.Shelby is a very kind and pleasant Doctor and I will not hesitate to recommend him to my other family members and friends.<//Review>< response>
