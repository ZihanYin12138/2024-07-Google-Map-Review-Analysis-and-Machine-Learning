Dr. Hadidchi cares about her patients. She is willing to go that extra mile to make sure your health is in the best shape it can be. The office staff is efficient and caring. I would recommend this doctor to anyone. She takes patients from babies to seniors.</text>

Doctor Hadichi is a great doctor, her office managers are a pleasure to speak with. I don't appreciate some of the people who answer her phone and Perhaps they should seek new employment. Those people are not a reflection of the doctor who cares deeply about her patients . Thank you Doctor Hadichi.</Review>

I haven’t had a primary doctor in years and wanted to find the right one and took time to look into many doctors and Dr. Shima caught my eye from her reviews. I made an appointment over the phone and got a call back with in days for a new patient consultation due to covid regulations but even though it was a consultation over the phone she was so caring, understanding professional took time to hear me out got to know me. She answered all the questions I had and so much more. I’m so pleased with her care and look forward to adding my children to her care as well. I appreciate all she’s done during this pandemic and thankful she is my primary doctor.</Text>

<date>1619733827602<//date><rate>2</rate><review>Very friendly nice people. But never call you back when they say they will. Hard to get prescriptions filled. Was prescribed medication that was not to be prescribed since I have coronary artery disease. I think that was result of me being new patient and because of cOvid I only had two phone appointments then this was discovered on actual visit.  Was prescribed ibuprofen and shouldn’t have been. Asked for two referrals to cardio doctor and ophthalmologist. Only received cardio referral and called a second time to get ophthalmologist and was told would get call back and never did. I know they are busy, but I am old and this gets real confusing. I do like the people and Doctor but seems like they don’t pay attention to details or need for follow up. Initially gave them 5 stars because they are very nice. But with all the issues I changed to two.

4/29/2021 Spoke with the staff today. They were very helpful to me today and I truly believe they cared about my situation. They bent over backwards to help me. I think what had occurred to me could very well be an anomaly. Very pleased today with my treatment. A thank you to Michelle the office manager, Ashley the authorization coordinator. And Of course Dr. Hadidchi. Sometimes we expect perfection from people, but in fact we are all prone to mistakes. We are all human. I will be happy having the Dr. and staff as my healthcare providers moving forward.< /review>< Pics>

I am beyond pleased with the service I receive from Justin. He is always patient with me and explains everything. I don’t feel rushed nor that he gives me a one size fix all diagnosis just to get me out the office. His level of care is why I decided to stay with this doctors office.< /Text>

Dr. Justin Atkins and Dr. Hadidchi are awesome!  i recently switched over to this medical practice and have been working with Dr, Atkins.  He is an incredible man:  he listens and really gets to the issues and works together with me on a plan on how to beat my ailments.  I recently contracted COVID 19 and was in touch with Dr.  Atkins.  I believe his consultation saved my life.  He told me if my oxygen levels drop from high 90's to the low 90's to immediately contact him or an ER.  It happened on Saturday Jan 23, 2021.  My oxygen levels dropped, I went to the ER and they admitted me immediately with bilateral pneumonia (acute respiratory distress) caused by COVID 19.  I spent 13 days at the hospital being treated for COVID, and it was on the severe side.  Thank goodness I'm home now recovering.  I fully owe my life to Dr. Atkins due to his consultation on my oxygen levels.  If he wouldn't have given me that advice, things would have been much, much worse.  Thank you Dr. Atkins!<//review>

Dr. Hadidchi is a great Doctor.
But her staff is incompetent.
The doctor prescribed me an increase in my pain medication but her staff put a hold on the increased medication until the original prescription was due to run out.
I was given an increase meaning I could take more.

I love Dr. Hadidchi!  She has been my 84-year-old  mother’s primary care physician for two years now.  She is a very attentive, professional, and caring physician.  Her staff is excellent too! All my mother’s  health concerns are handled in a prompt, organized and caring way.  I know I can trust Dr. Hadidchi to provide the best healthcare possible for my mom. Thank you Dr. Hadidchi and your wonderful staff for doing such a great job each day.</Text>

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. First off I got a rapid covid test done because I had a pregnant wife who was coming home. I had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for covid and my wife was coming back from staying with her parents in a low covid risk area. Upon getting to the office I waited for over 30 mins outside in my car until they finally brought the test out to me but even after calling multiple times and informing them I was having the rapid test done they bring out a PCR test and I have to ask if it was a rapid test which I wasn’t. After waiting for over an hour for the correct test I did it and after waiting for the results I was told I was negative and the nurse walks away. The issue I have with this is that nothing was said to me concerning the test. No percentage of the chances of a false positive or false negative no instructions as to wether I should still be cautious it was just here is your test goodbye. The next day I take a PCR test for covid because I needed it to go to work as it was the only test they accepted after close contact with someone who had covid and I received my results two days later and I was positive for covid (I had to call them when they were suppose to call me and I can understand being busy but a curtesy call was all it would have taken to tell me they were running behind, no curtesy call was given) and after asking the nurse why no information pertaining to the rapid test results and the accuracy of the results or any medical advice regarding the results was given to me and that now I have probably given my pregnant wife the virus, he simply tried his best to get me off the phone and at the end when I ask who I can speak to he says, “you can call the governor for all I care I’ll tell my management to follow up with you then he hangs up on me. Over all from all the comments I’ve read when ever it was bad the issue was with the poor attitude of the staff and it seems to me that the problem is not getting fixed. No one cares to fix it.< /Text>

The PA Justin was nice. However I was prescribed 3 prescriptions & a total blood panel & my prescription wasn’t sent. I had to call the office 3 times over 4 days until I finally got it. And was told by the office blood panel never ordered. So frustrating<//Review>

Dr Shima Hadidchi is literally one of the most genuine caring Dr’s I have ever had the great pleasure of knowing.  She has been my Dr for years, I truly love her. There has never been a time in her care that has not been treated with such caring  priority .  Her office staff work so diligently to handle all the patients with such great empathy and truly caring for all there needs. She’s just the best.<//text>

Dr. Hadidchi is by far the most caring doctor I've ever been too. I have a lot of complications for a woman my age, I've went through a lot of doctors until I found Dr. Hadidchi. She goes above and beyond for her patients. I will NEVER go to any other Primary as long as Dr. Hadidchi is here.<//review>

<Review>I no longer go into the office for appointments. Due to Covid-19, we relate to one another by phone. The calls are well structured. I, the patient calls the Drs. office. I make an appt. with one of the receptionists to talk to either, Dr. Hididchi, or Nurse-Practitioner Justin. It takes all of two minutes to do this. I always make sure I am on time to answer my phone at the appointed time, as their call is always prompt. During our "appointment" the person you talk to is always pleasant and makes you feel very comfortable. They make sure you are satisfied with the answers you recieved to your questions before they end the phone call. All in all, the entire experience rates 5 stars. When I hang up after the phone call, I'm smiling and satisfied. I'm happy to say good things about my Doctor's Office, and all who work there.< /Review>< Pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Dr hadidchi is a very kind, compassionate, and caring Dr. Truly one of a kind. Very attentive to my concerns and helped me every way possible. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a PCP Dr. She even offers tele visits, so if you need quick antibiotics or have any questions shes can just call you, and thats it! Will keep her as my Dr hopefully for a long time. Jorge the N.P also helped me after I had surgery and got me what i needed 👍 super cool dude.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I have been going to this doctors office for over a year now. I am new to the area and was using this office as my primary care. As of now I need to find a new primary care physician. I do not recommend using this office for primary care. I will say the doctor I was seeing (Jorge) is well versed, however, It takes two weeks to get an appointment and the front office workers generally do not care. I had to wait 1 month plus to be seen for a flu that I had. When I was finally seen I had a host of problems. The office takes a long time to see patients and they rushed me. Just this past visit a woman from the office popped her head in not even 3 minutes into me listing my symptoms and told the nurse to hurry up! I forgot to ask for a referral among the 5 other needs I had. I called into the office they said I needed to make another appointment 2 weeks out to ask him. I asked if I could speak with him on the phone. They told me the doctors do not do that. Do not go here if it is serious. The doctor prescribed me too little of my medication. The bottle was very small. When I called for a refill for the cough syrup they told me I would have to make another appointment two weeks out! Yvonne lied to me and told me that it was illegal for refills. I second checked the law and this was not true. She then told me to go to a urgent care. The doctor incorrectly wrote a prescription that was supposed to be for imaging. Instead he wrote a prescription for the same ct scan I just had done and showed him the results of. Honest mistake. The doctor specifically told me he “needs an MRI” to see the concussion I recently got. Called the office for them to ask the doctor and correct the orders on Thursday. Yvonne said she would ask him and give me a call back. I called again later that day and she made an excuse. Called twice Friday, she made an excuse. Called again after no response Monday. She made another excuse. She kept telling me they would call me back and they never did! I spent a lot of time and energy just trying to communicate with these people! Called at the end of the day Monday and finally told her how they are doing wrong by their patients operating in this manner. She did not care at all. I said something needs to be done so I will write a review to show people what they are getting into before they do. Hopefully this will help others and save their time. Or perhaps light a fire under the managements butts to get them to figure out their operations properly. FYI Yvonne this is what happens when you do not care. Now I am going to find a highly reviewed doctor’s office.</review><date>1553567102650</date><user_id>109360371921726734477< /user_id></record>

Ok....so so far this is only my second time here but I'm really liking it...The doctor really made me feel comfortable and like I could really talk to her about any concerns. She also took the time to chat with me a little and made me feel like she cared. Boy I hope I have finally found the right doctor for me!< /Text>

Cons: Front office staff is completely rude. Horrible attitude. They talked in fast and short sentences to try to get rid of me. Wait time was 2 hours long. Provider was overbooked. Pros: The F.N.P Christine was really nice as well as the back office M.A. Also, my referral was approved within a day. Staff needs to work on their front office staff because, they’re the first people we see and we should always feel welcomed and cared for. Even when I make a phone call to ask questions they’re completely rude. Opinion based on my first visit.< /review>

Dr Hadidchi is great but I had a morning appointment and waited over an hour and a half. Then tried to charge fees for LOA paperwork at $100 on top of the copay. The last office I visited was only $25. That's absolutely ridiculous. This is standard paperwork not a fee for rushed service.<//text>

How does a primary doctor,  meeting a patient for the first time, who hasn't seen a doctor in over 25 years, not do a general work up?  NEVER listens to my heart or lungs, no palpitations of stomach , or breasts for lumps, but is very quick to write a prescription for high blood pressure after only 1 reading. ( have never had high blood pressure.)
Heaven forbid, you need to talk to the doctor about a prescription problem, you could be waiting 2-3 days , before getting an answer. And the staff won't call you back, you just sit wondering if anyone knows what's going on.
I esp.dont like being called a "customer" instead of a patient. I would like to live in my fantasy,  that my doctor actually cared about my health and didn't see dollar signs.
I feel IEHP's  professional doctor's are rare, you get nurse practitioners, Physicians Assistance, but pay them like they were real doctors
Hopefully,  I will never have something seriously wrong. Hope this helped< /Review>

I always like to give places a try for myself disregarding bad reviews but most of these are on point . It’s Not like any other place I been to . there’s a few Dr.’s in the building and sometimes you don’t even get the one you’re ‘assigned ‘. For the most part the doctors are nice but the ladies in the front are so rude ! Any appointment wanting to be made is a 3 - 4 weeks waiting time .<//Text>

I almost don't want to let the cat out of the bag because I LOVE that I can call and get a same day or next day appointment, but I know how crap health care services can be in this desert and Dr Hadidichi's office is an exception to that norm which we've all unfortunately grown accustom to. Dr. Hadidichi and her PAs are kind, caring, and take the time to listen to your concerns, answer your questions and overall put you at ease with their friendly and cheerful demeanor. They take necessary actions to make sure you're healthy by ensuring that you get routine labworks and don't hesistate to send you to a specialist if something specific is going on. The office staff is friendly, but as with most doctors offices you have to make sure you stay on top of things and invest time in followups when it comes to getting admistrative assistance with referrals, etc. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this doctors office.< /text>

This office is very unfriendly and the staff is very rude and they all act very snobby. They hide behind a glass window with a sign that says "Do tap, open or touch glass window and that they would get to you when they can!!!  This is a subliminal message they are putting out to the patients/customers to leave us alone and all we want is MONEY!!! and if we don't want to see, talk or have any interaction with patients/customers. After waiting for 10 minutes in the lobby. The place has a very unwelcoming sad feeling. The waiting are was dirty and very unwelcoming. If you like to be treated bad and you want to hate your life more.....Please come to this doctors office!< /Text>

Attentive and informative staff.  Rented a 10’x38’ space with a special discount incentive which sealed the deal.  They offer a moving truck at a very fair price which I took advantage to move into my space.  Highly recommended!</Text>

<Review>An excellent storage facility run by great ownership. Spoke with Rich throughout my quote + rental process and he was friendly, professional, very communicative and thoroughly explained all the questions I had. Since I didn't need my unit immediately, Rich held a unit for me for the standard 5 days and then sent over the rental agreement so that I didn't have to pay an additional pro-rated fee, which was not necessary but very generous. Upon arriving to handle the rental agreement and take possession of the unit, Rich was on-site and explained the facility and its security features, which includes a custom buzz code that must be entered upon check-in and check-out. I am renting a unit for 12 months while I wait to move into my new home and it's been so easy to come/go from the facility as I stop by my unit. Also, it is clean and well kept, and the units are taken care of. Highly recommend!!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

This place is clean and feels very safe. Each unit has its own alarm which is great (just remember to enter your code before entering to turn it off or you get charged a fee). The office staff is great, courteous, and very responsive. Definitely glad we went with Anchor Self Storage.<//text>

I recently moved furniture into a storage space and the process was incredibly smooth.. Never have I ever seen a storage space so clean....even the hall ways were spick and span....not even a lick of dust...Shout out to the courteous front desk staff (Julian) for his wonderful enthusiasm and astute professionalism. Mad props to the manager (Richard) for his upbeat attitude and attention to detail. I highly recommend Anchor self storage-Vallejo’s finest self storage facility by a long shot.< /review>

I stored my belonging for three years with Anchor Self Storage. The customer service was always exceptional, professional, and understanding. I never had any issues with billing; in fact, they were always accommodating.

I did not check on my things, but when I went to pick them up, they were in pristine condition. There was no humidity, smells, or any other inconvenience. I am delighted with this company. Thank you! 🙏 I highly recommend it.< /review>

<Text>Excellent facility; clean,  well ventilated, well lighted and with a good security system.  Staff is awesome.. Only complaint is that it smells like a 1000 a**holes all came together and dropped a serious duece at the same time! There must be some type of sh.t refinery or something nearby cause the smell is ferrrrocious! If you can handle the smell its probably the best storage facility in town.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

George was very warm and welcoming and knowledgeable of what I needed over the phone. When we met in person he was very courteous and helpful. It was very hot that day he offered water and then showed me the facility. The maintenance of the facility and grounds were immaculate. The storage facility have a great security tracking system that helps them track the volume of persons entering and exiting the property.

George, the Manager of Anchor Vallejo was lovely. He answered all my questions when I phoned—-I’ve never rented a Self Storage unit before so didn’t know what to expect—and was friendly, concise, and organized when I stopped by. I saw the specific unit, signed the paperwork and was out in about 20 minutes. A very pleasant experience!</text>

The cleanest, best kept self-storage space I’ve ever seen. In addition to having an on-site, live-in manager, each unit is individually alarmed and includes an interior light (yay! no more flashlight searches in the dark!). We found Anchor after experiencing a break-in at another local storage place where people were being allowed to camp in their cars and trucks overnight.  I feel like I’ve finally found a place where I don’t have to worry about the security of my stored items.</Review>

<Review>This storage facility is very clean.  It is a newer facility. The management is very
professional and tells you what's expected in detail when check in. I am very pleased with my experience at Anchor Storage  and I would recommend this facilty to anyone looking to store their belongings.  The security is excellent. I felt that my belongings were safe at all times.</Review>< Pics>

The way a storage  establishment should be. Great staff,  clean property. Outhouse bathroom.  Which is kinda neccessary when you are there for awhile.
Thanks guys.<//Text>

By far the cleanest storage facility I have ever rented from. I have been renting here for almost 2 yrs. Having a young child cleanliness
Was a big concern. The bathroom is as clean as my home 😍
The units are free of pests and rodents which ensures that my items being stored won't be destroyed.👏
The Manager George is a very warm welcoming person.  If I am making a payment or pop in just to grab a box or some tape he is always extremely hospitable. He always has crayons  and paper handy for the little future piccasso's Of the world🎨🖼
Overall this facility is so warm and inviting if I have to store my items the safest place for them to be stored is here. There is no better place than this!!<//Review>

I highly recommend Maritza Fox. She is knowledgeable, has patience , and very helpful. I have learned so much from her . I’m glad I chose Fox Microblading and PMU Academy. I live in San Diego , almost 2 hours away .  I did my research from other classes closer to me , the reason I chose this academy was because you get more knowledge on line and 3 days in class . The price is affordable . Thanks Fox team for all your help !</text>

I would definitely 10/10 recommend this academy! Instructor Maritza Fox and coordinator Alan genuinely want the best for you and want to see you succeed and they will do what ever it takes to make sure you succeed. The class is 3 days online and 3 days in class which is perfect for anyone who has a tight schedule, and wants to get into a career as fast as possible! I learned absolutely everything I need to know in the 3 days. Ms. Fox takes passion in what she does and she is amazing at it! Thank you and I will definitely be recommending this academy to my friends!</Review>

What an amazing experience! From the first day I walked in for the training, everyone was so welcoming and friendly. I am so so happy I took this class with Maritza at Fox. The 6 day course was just amazing!! I learned so much about the microblading process from theory to hands on. Very informative!! Maritza was so patient and helpful every step of the way. I loved her training style. Thank you for your guidance Maritza!!<//text>

Along with her super sweet and helpful staff, Maritza also is a knowledgeable and a patient instructor with a diverse background. She implements key fundamentals of permanent makeup in her course along with her own experiences and perspective with her business background. She took care us each individually to target areas of improvement and even made herself available as a resource and mentor. I feel confident running my own business in such a short period of time.

Watching her do brows is so therapeutic her hand flows so beautifully!! Can't wait to take the lip and eyeliner course! Pricing is so affordable and worth every penny. If you are looking into microblading Fox is so worth it!! Thank you Maritza you are a huge part in my journey to come!!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<review>I can now say that I am a certified Permanent Makeup Artist, all thanks to Maritza and her welcoming staff! I took the in-person microblading certification course and learned so much. Maritza Fox, the founder of Fox Microblading Academy, is undoubtedly a true professional, well experienced in her craft, helpful, passionate, and just amazing! There was so much to learn and take away from all of Maritza’s training and advice etc. I would highly recommend taking her class and starting your own beauty business journey!

working with my instructor Maritza Fox was an amazing and one of a kind experience. she’s aware of how competitive the industry of permanent makeup is  and tells you what you don’t want to hear but what you need to hear because she really wants to see you succeed. she talks about other schools from a non biased perspective and explains their methods and why they don’t work instead of only promoting her school. she lets you know that she is really here to care for you and wants to push you. she’s hard on you because she sees your potential and really works to see your weaknesses and makes sure that you understand before moving on. she offers the most help at an affordable price when she can definitely charge more for everything she teaches. and on top of that she has the nicest and funniest personality to be teaching the class too. she’s great and is definitely a master instructor 10/10 would recommend her to anyone that wants to learn microblading and microshading.<//text>

She is a perfectionist! My eyebrows were sparse and totally uneven when I went in. I hated waking up and feeling like I had no eyebrows. My best friend highly recommended her to me and I’m so glad she did. She treats you like family, makes sure you’re comfortable, and makes sure you’re happy with the results. Best decision ever.</review>

Maritza and her team are amazing. They give you their full on attention the second you walk in the door. You don't ever get the feeling of not being able to catch up with fellow classmates since every student gets the same one on one attention fully focusing on what you need the most help with. I'll be forever grateful to have came across such wonderful people that clearly make their students success their number one priority.< /text>

I have had the best experience in the class and even weeks after that I have completed the course I still have contact with the instructor Maritza Fox and she answers very promptly to any questions I may have. I 10/10 recommend this academy if you’re looking for one on one training. The Fox’s won’t disappoint!< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Fox Microblading academy taught me gave me everything they promised and more! Maritza is an amazing instructor who equips you with all the tools you need to succeed! She goes above and beyond to guide and support you into becoming the best PMU artist possible. The small class size and detailed instruction make for an amazing learning environment. I’d recommend her course to anyone looking to develop the skill and knowledge of the PMU industry needed to be a well rounded  professional. Thank you so much to everyone at Fox for empowering students like me to grow in this industry.< /Review><rate>5< /rate>< Response>

Very well deserved 5 star rating for this academy. Super clean and presentable ambiance. Maritza is the sweetest instructor ever. She wants to see you succeed so she pours her knowledge on her students with patience and love. Alan was very informative regarding enrollment. Thank you Valeria for being super sweet and helpful to everyone.  Walked in one day and in less than one week I  started the program. Thank you Fox Academy for your guidance and diligent efforts in preparing your students for the ever growing world of Microblading. Love always, Lauren.</review>

The microblading class was amazing. From the start of registration, Alan was very helpful and professional. I called several training facilities, which were rude and acted like I was wasting their time by asking questions, not Alan. Every question I asked was answered and he said if you have any others questions please let us know.

Maritza the instructor was absolutely amazing. She was very patient, informative, professional, and her demeanor was so inviting, it literally made me so comfortable and interested in her training. Maritza is one person and with several students in the class you never feel you did not get enough of her time. Not only does she give plenty of her time in training, she also stated if we have any questions after the training class we can contact her and she will assist us.

Being trained by Maritza will set you up to do amazing eyebrows. She is very well known in the industry, from brows, lips and corrections. Her training facility is extremely clean and her assistants are nice and helpful.

Thank you again Maritza........

My mom and I came in for our eyebrows and I gotta say it was the best experience ever. We did not know what to expect but everybody was very nice and helpful. Thank you Maritza for taking care of my mom. I'm really bad with names so I do not remember the name of the instructor who was taking care of me, but thank you thank you. I'm definitely coming back, and also thank you to Alan and the girl at the front you really make everybody feel welcome. I recommend this place you won't regret it.< /Review>

I have had the most amazing experience the past four days attending the microblading training course here at Fox! Maritza and Alma my instructors were SO passionate for this industry and assured they would do everything in their power to set us up for success before we go into the real world! Training was hands on, very detailed and in depth. They were always encouraging us to never give up, this experience has done wonders for my confidence and improved my skill like crazy!! I feel confident from the training/information provided in this course, making taking on this big industry a little easier on me! There are many places to chose from but I see why I had a good feeling about this one!</text>

I began researching schools that would help me excel in the world of permanent makeup which I find to be very passionate about because it is a technique and skill to help others feel completely beautiful about themselves. I want to help change lives of many and help them look and feel their absolute best. After countless hours of this search I came across Fox Microblading and PMU Academy where Maritza and the other staff have been nothing but welcoming and helpful to me on my journey. The abundance of knowledge and the level support is nothing short of amazing. You can tell that her heart is about making each one of her students successful.
Maritza’s experience as an instructor has led her to be successful in opening her very own school and I am grateful for that. She has taught me not only technique but everything from the Legal side to the customer service side of this industry. She is not about making a quick buck for someone to pay for school she really wants you to become the best you can be. When you are done with school do not think that she will be done with you the academy offers continued support.

Of the highest of highs, I recommend Fox Microblading Academy and PMU.< /Text>

I recently attended Fox Microblading Academy and received both my Microblading/PMU and Microchanneling with camouflage certifications. Maritza, the instructor was a phenomenal teacher and really put her whole heart into teaching the material and making sure I understood all the fundamentals of the trade. She not only showed me all of her amazing transformations, but her mistakes from when she first started out and how she fixed them so that I could learn from them. She taught me how to choose the right pigments (color), determine eyebrow shapes, and execute the task on clients, as well as county health standards & regulations. I could not have been more satisfied with my learning experience at FOX and highly recommend this academy to anyone interested in the microblading or PMU industry!<//Text>

I’ve taken a few PMU courses here now and I super recommend fox microblading! I was very selective when I chose my training , I looked all over social media, had messaged private artists schools all over so cal I even considered flying to another state to maybe take some classes and man I am sooo happy I chose to stay here in SOCAL with Maritza! Not only affordable but  the class I took was very small only about 6 students so we each had that individual attention where we could really ask questions and learn step by step. Additionally the school is there to support you in the long run with not just techniques but marketing, tool selection sanitation setting up your place etc u name it! I have watched  soo many online tutorials on all permanent makeup techniques but I’m glad that I chose to go in person to fox because now I understand than no online course can replace the in person hands on training she provides!</text>

Came here as an eyebrow model, came back for a touch up. I loved my eyebrows, Maritza is patient and takes her time.

I can't recommend this place enough. Thanks for the confidence boost!<//review>

LOVE Fox Microblading and PMU Academy!  I have had my eyebrows, eyeliner and Needling done twice on my face and neck.

Ms. Fox, Owner has done the work and she is an absolute expert, explained every step, insisted on my comfort level be maintained plus she provides a very sterile environment.

Ms. Fox follows a strict protocol to ensure absolute safety and clean environment preventing injury and infection.

I highly recommend having work done here and you will be more than satisfied!<//text>

Maritza is by far the best instructor out there for Microblading and permanent makeup. She is very knowledgeable at what she does, very supportive and the sweetest person ever. There is not one question that she can't or don't have the answer to. What I love about Maritza is that her goal is to help others to be successful! You don't see that often I can tell you that from my experience. I came from another school and am not happy at all. I did not learn anything from that school but not with Fox Microblading & PMU Acadenmy. Thank you so much for your love and care Maritza!

I highly recommend Fox Microblading & PMU Academy, you will not regret it! Just contact Maritza.< /Text>

Fox Microblading and PMU Acadamy was amazing!! The teacher/owner Maritza was so knowledgeable and continues to make her experience and knowledge available when ever I have a question or need extra guidance. I highly recommend this school. It’s a small class schedule and very hands on. Starting a new career was not only exciting but I felt that I was trained and learned so much with Fox and Maritza.<//text>

I don’t know where to start... Maritza is an excellent and a very genuine teacher. She has a lot of experience and talent and she is not AFRAID of sharing it with her students. I searched for schools online before meeting Maritza and she was the first one I met but she and I clicked right away so I didn’t even want to shop around. I started my program right away and today I’m certified!!! Thanks Maritza and team!!!< /text>

<Text>I had amazing experience with Fox microblading and pmu academy, they had the best pasion instructors they want to make sure that you understood the skin and face anatomy and the color wheel, they are very proffisional and they are very passion to their work, 4 intensive days really I learned a lot and I didn't received the certificate except when you pass the exam and the final project which is work on your model under the instructors supervision, Maritza is amazing woman and Alma as well the whole team very friendly and professional they tell you all the information you need and even more, I graduate today and I feel that I can open my own place because they let you understand all the steps so you can do it.. I highly recommend Fox Microblading and PMU academy to everyone what to be a real pmu.

I had an excellent experience at Fox Microblading & PMU Academy. I was trained in Microblading, Lips, Eyeliner and Skin Needling. I am very satisfied with all the great methods and extensive knowledge I received during my training.

Maritza Fox, the instructor, is a genuine, smart and supportive person. She was very detailed when providing training in safety protocol, marketing, legal issues and off course in every aspect of Microblading, PMU, and Skin Needling. Maritza was also  great in responding to any and all my concerns and questions. Maritza also provided extended time to make sure, I fully understood each subject. During practice sessions with live models, Maritza was patient and always made sure students followed and understood the importance of personal protective equipment and its use for both, the client and the student. Following all safety protocol is crucial for both the health of each client as well as each student. Her persistence in making sure each student follows all safety and health rules increased my trust towards her as an instructor and as a person.

I highly recommend Fox Microblading and PMU Academy. The facility is very clean and provides a great learning environment. The staff are very pleasant and professional. Maritza Fox is a great instructor who truly cares for her students.

Maritza has continued to encouraged me to give my best without being intimidating. She has a lot of patience and a genuine interest in seeing her students succeed in this industry. Her ongoing support is very valuable to me and is highly appreciated it.

Thanks Maritza for your great guidance and teachings!

This is my story. It's NOT just a review but a story that I will continue to tell. I am a licensed and certified microblading artist. I came to Maritza with so many questions. Even though I was already in the business I feel like there's so much more I can learn. I was debating whether I should spend the money and time to go to another school or not. Since Maritza offers an advance class I decided sign up for it.

1st and foremost, KNOW what school you're going for. Many schools are really just out for your money. You're there for a few days, in & out with very little knowledge. This is the truth, some will struggle mapping & drawing. Some will struggle with color theory. Many will struggle with marketing. This academy will cover every ounce of it. There is not one thing that will be left out. Some schools are misleading but this academy is pretty straight forward. You're not only here to learn but you will develop a relationship with Maritza too. She makes you feel comfortable, confident, she makes you feel IMPORTANT. I've never been so excited to get up every morning to come to class. I love coming back. The class is intimate so you get a lot of one on one time with Maritza. You learn several techniques, multiple ways to map brows, pigments, color theory, marketing, information on everything!!!

Now, I want to take a moment to mention about the other staff here especially her husband. I had so many questions about the business side of this. He listened to me and inform me in any way he could. Both Maritza and her husband are very knowledgeable about everything. Anyone can tell they're both genuine who truly cares about your future. They will support you even after you're finished with the courses. Trust me I know because I'm STILL HERE, soaking everything I can. Whenever I have questions I come in and I will get the help I need. I had an issue and they both have helped me get back on my feet and back in business. I'm a mother of 5. I don't have the time nor the money to invest aimlessly. This academy is WORTH IT. I'm forever thankful for their help. Now I'm looking forward to finishing all the other courses that I'm taking. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this school. I can go on and on but if anyone have any questions, I'm your go to girl! Thank you Maritza, you are truly amazing.</review>

I have been searching to get into the eyebrow trend.  I was so nervous , because this was my first time getting mircobalding. The students was wonderful. My eyebrows are so beautiful. Believe me when I say, they know what they are doing. They are so professiknal in every area. The whole staff was friendly. The place was so clean, I felt comfort enough to rest. Everything was wiped down properly and the sharp objects was put in sharp container.  I was so lucky to find Fox  Microbalding &PMU associations
I have alreasy set another appointment for another service. I have already been telling everyone about this place. I will be back.</review>

<review>Fox Microblading Academy is by far the best academy I can recommend to anyone wanting to learn how to microblade. Maritza is heaven sent. I learned so much in these last couple of days that I didn’t think was even possible. She taught me a lot of information and different techniques on how to be successful in Microblading and PMU. The atmosphere is beyond amazing from the cool, clean environment, amazing smell, very sanitized, amazing staff and overall you exit with lots of knowledge and with a mindset of knowing you can accomplish any and everything. I have trained with some of the worst trainers, I’ve wasted money, I’ve shedded several tears on investments I made for myself that went terribly wrong due to lack of training. Finally I found my place I’m grateful to call my second home. Even after leaving she is still with you, there to help you to continue to grow and answer any questions you may have. You are never alone with Maritza as your trainer. She’s so sweet and so humble. Eager to help others in anyway she can.  Train with her today and invest in yourself with her skills, guidance, and technique or hate yourself tomorrow.< /review>< userid>

<text>I honestly dont know where to start there are so many many good things about Fox Microblading Academy, coming here was the best decision i’ve could made it completly change my life, it took a different route, but love it and I don’t regret it at all.  My experience in this academy was extraordinary starting with the Maritza, her daughter Valeria and not to forget her husband they all make you feel so welcome and they so nice and very helpful with any needs you might need.  I learned so much from basics to advance techniques that just make me feel passionate about this career.  Thank you soo much Maritza for your patience, your knowledge and that passion that show in every class it just motivated me more to learn more and more and not stop i feel like this is my second home.  Another good thing about this academy is that they offer classes in spanish for all those people who can not understand english and would like to take the class in their own language. Overall this academy is amazing the enviroment so relaxing that time goes by fast and you dont want to leave.  Thank you for all the knowledge Maritza and your good advice, thank you Valeria for being such a sweet and nice person and making us all feel like queens.  I highly highly recommend Fox Microblading Academy to all those people who like to change their careers, trust me you wont regret the money you pay is totally worth it, give it a try, it it was for me i will give more than 5 stars.<//text>< time>

Omg!! I am thrilled and beyond amazed by how AMAZING my brows look after getting micro bladed by MARINA. i work and do hair at salon ambiance right next store and when this place opened up i was excited! I got my brows microbladed about 5 years ago and they have faded sooooo Much. So it was time for new brows. I scheduled an appointment with MARINA and wow, i am totally pleased and sp happy! It only took about 2 hours total and she made me feel comfortable and not anxious i even fell asleep! I will definitely reccomend anyone who is looking to get permanent makeup to come to fox microblading.  Ask for marina or miss foxy herself ;) without these 2 girls; i wouodnt feel as amazing as i do right now! So much happier and now i dont have to feel so insecure about my brows when i wake up in the morning.
THANK YOU MARITZA AND MARINA FOR MAKING ME FEEL JUST ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS. i have my confidence back and just in time for my 30th birthday.   :)< /review>

I don't know where to start when it comes to FOX Acadamy.  Maritza Fox is a Mentor and a friend. I’ve learned so much from Maritza than I had with the previous school.  I like hanging out at her studio, whenever I’m there her husband and daughter made me feel welcome. They’re wonderful people.
I highly recommend Fox Acadamy to anyone want to invest in a new career path to get started with Fox Acadamy.  Maritza will teach you everything she knows, and she continues to nurture you after you graduate.
I can't rave enough about Maritza; she is an inspiration.  She’s a woman with a gift and mission to help her student succeed. The rest's up to you!
I love her; and her family.  Her studio is a second home for me.  I love hanging out, practicing, visit at Fox Acadamy. Yes, Maritza is that great!!!!!< /Review>

Matt was amazing. He was one of the best massage therapists I’ve ever had. He was so friendly and his hands were magical! I have t had a massage that perfect in a very long time. I will definitely go back and definitely request him again :) highly recommend this spot. It is extremely clean and has a lovely design/feel to it. The front girls were such joys! Loved everything about massage today. Wish it would have been longer!!!< /review>

Amanda was amazing. I have a good amount of injuries from long distance running and basketball, so my body is fragile to say the least.

When I arrived, I was greeted with the warmest welcome and had a little bit of conversation which was refreshing. I filled out a sheet about myself and pain areas then waited a couple of minutes before entering the room.

Everything was clean and peaceful. After a couple of questions from Amanda, she started working on my body and for the first time I didn’t have to say another word. She just felt through the areas and worked on them and I felt great after.<//Text>

My mother in law gave me a $300 gift card which I was expecting to put towards my yearly membership. Turns out, this location cannot pull monthly payments from the gift card. I got the gift card with this company because the Newport location said they would be able to use the gift card and I had no idea the Irvine location was different. I ended up paying almost twice as much for a massage. Super bummed. The only positive was Hernan, my massage therapist, who has superb skills at getting knots out. Ask for him.<//Review>

Elvie was really professional and focused on the areas of my back and legs that needed the most work as I was incredibly sore. I had a couple knots in my back and with her technique along with the hot stone was able to relief any pain and soreness that I had. I highly recommend her and I’ll definitely be back! Thank you again :)</Text>

< Review>
I purchased the membership and think it's a good idea if you want to make "self care" a personal commitment. I have taken up yoga and strength training and going for a massage feels so good on my sore muscles. Cameron has been my masseuse twice a d I recommend him. He’s very strong. My sore muscles appreciated his technique - LONG DEEP and SMOOTHING but not painful pressure. He’s kind and professional. I felt very comfortable under his care.</Review>

I called this location today in need of a last minute massage and thankfully they were able to book me within 20 minutes! The introductory rate was a good price- $80 for one hour. The girls at the front were super nice and my masseuse Alaina was amazing. She was communicative throughout the massage and after notated areas with tension and gave recommendations for next time I come back. Excellent service!<//Review>

It would have been nicer if when they called to confirm your appointment they would let you know that you have to sit outside on a bench while waiting. It was a cool day in Newport Beach and I didn’t bring a jacket so I was quite cold while I was waiting</text>

I went in for a 60 minute massage with Alaina to treat upper back and neck pain that causes migraines. She was incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and thoughtful and gave me good suggestions for follow up treatment. Although I’m just visiting CA, I wish I could take Alaina home with me! The office was clean and reception was helpful in scheduling my appointment and incoming me of all of my future options. 10/10 would recommend!<//Review>

Had a girls’ weekend complete with massage! Found Massage Heights online. Alaina at the Newport Beach location is very knowledgeable and gave me an excellent massage with the precise amount pressure in all my problem spots. Alaina also educated me on measures I can take to decrease my pain and discomfort. Nene was the perfect masseuse for my friend, as well. She was took great care to focus on requested areas and steer clear of the others. Both therapists are professional, thorough, and intentional. Looking forward to next time!!!< /text>

I love it here! All the employees are friendly and very accommodating. They provide excellent service every time I come. I’ve tried multiple massage therapists here and they’ve all been great. Highly recommend getting a membership. They’re reasonably priced and it helps you make sure to come in to get your massage monthly and take care of yourself. MH has really helped me with my back pain and stress. I’ve also had some great facials here!< /review>

If you ask them which therapist would best fit in terms of specific focus areas or whatever you are dealing with that day they know who to place you with.

The front desk person was very nice and the place is clean.
I paid for a deep tissue massage and that did not happen.
The masseuse rubbed lotion on me and that was it.  She spent more time changing the blankets and sheets around then giving me a massage.

My husband and I have been coming to this location of Massage Heights for monthly massages for a year and we are very pleased with our massage therapists.  I have had 5-6 different therapists and they typically haven't stuck around for more than a year, but then I have no problem finding another good one - and I am selective!  The front desk does a great job recommending a therapist based on your needs and they track your payments accurately.  Everyone is friendly and welcoming!<//review>

It depends on WHO gives you the massage. Once you find the right therapist for you (and s/he sticks around), you can get a great massage. I've had some of the best massages, and some of the worst. The problem: they have tremendous turnover. Also: I've never had an issue with my payment plan. I was skeptical to commit for a year, but I've been going for almost two, with no issues.</text>

<Text>Yelp Has Deleted this Review - So I am Re-posting Here. The same receptionist is always there to make you feel unwelcome and greet you with a cold, vacant stare. Perhaps she is suffering from hypothermia as the lobby temperature varies from freezing to chilly with most days being freezing. Is she always there? It'd be nice to see a warmer, friendlier face there every now and then.< /Text><Rate>1<//Rate>< date>

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE for me here.  Once I had succumbed to the pressure of taking their 12 month membership I was treated as if I was an inconvenience.  This ended up with me being asked to leave by an incredibly rude manager because my credit card had not been processed for the NEXT month's membership.  Even though my card had been stolen and cancelled AND I still had 3 credit massages from the previous month.  Despite being humiliated in this way - what I find most incredible is that all THREE therapists were sitting outside waiting for customers at the time. The massages were average at best - so I guess the word is out on that too.
So they prefer to take your membership money and hang around chatting with each other rather than provide you with the service that has ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR.< /Review>

<review>My experience here was just okay, not bad not great, just mediocre. Front desk girls are very pleasant, and my masseuse was very polite. However when in the room, my masseuse was telling me how tired she was and how badly she needed a massage herself. Then after walking out of there, I realized that she did not do a good job of flushing me completely and woke up the next day sore and tired! NOT how one should feel post massage! (yes I drank plenty of water before and after!)   Wont be back, unfortunately :(</review>< userid>

Really amazing store and workers! I've got a few things there, and they are so helpful. I am often there and have brought friends just to spend time looking at their impressive animals, including saltwater eels, monitor lizards, wide arrays of snakes, crabs, ciclids and more. It's worth going just to view the animals and they are happy to let you hold anything holdable!!<//review>

< Review>
Easy location, fair selection of fish / reptiles / accessories, reasonable prices, fairly competent staff and sometimes helpful.

The atmosphere is stagnant and dirty.  Many large fish & reptiles kept in cages that are too small for their size (Google size / cage charts if you dont believe me) Plant section is sparse and looks neglected. The back area is FILTHY. I question the health and well being of their animals.

If I were an animal who was kept there, I would rather be dead than alive.<//Review>

They can be a bit pricey for some types of fish, but they're worth it. They honor a 7 day return policy for dead fish as long as your water quality is stable and well suited for aquatic life. They also have some pretty cool reptiles. The only complaint I have is their limited selection of supplies.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Clean,  well stocked shop for the fish and reptile enthusiast.  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable,  and the prices are very reasonable,  too.  There is ample parking as well.  This shop is worth my drive from Marin.<//text>

There's a great selection of fish at Fish Pros, fresh and salt water. The employees are very nice and they love what they do. I've always had good experiences with them. Definitely recommend them if you're looking to buy fish or fish supplies!<//text>

I quickly popped in to check out the fresh water selection. The selection was low but the associates were plesent and friendly. The exotic pets were bad ass! Prices were on par with other aquariums in Sonoma County. You can spend hours in there looking at all the cool species.<//review>

<Review>This was the absolute worst neglect I have ever seen in a store!! I couldn’t sleep after  my visit there on 5/31/18! I have never been in a more filthy disgusting insane negative neglected store! These poor reptiles looked sick and dying! The tanks were all filthy and so past neglect! I am going to report this store to animal control and I pray they get closed down and these poor animals are rescued! Do not shop here or support this sickness! Besides that the guy at the counter was the worst customer service I’ve ever seen! Sick ass people running this place!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

Friendly staff, always someone around to offer assistance.

Most fish looked healthy, although it's hard to tell since with the low lighting.  Prices ok, about average.  Some tanks especially their guppy tank contained fish with ick (would have liked to see a sign saying not for sale).

Update: new name so possibly new owners, staff eager to help, better selection of less common fish, no obvious disease noted on fish like my last visit many years ago.< /Text>

< review>
I have been going to this place for years and have watched it change owners. The current owner is a down to earth knowledgable guy. However, the kids that work there are annoying know it alls who will make up an answer on the fly instead of saying they dont know. Also, with the exception of 1 of the workers there that is always doing the grunt work the rest stand around and are rude. If you come in 30 minutes before they close expect to be hassled and reminded every 5 minutes that they will be closing soon. I have been an aquarist when most of those kids were still in diapers so it is annoying  when they spew bs out of their mouths instead of saying, "i don't know, let me go find out". The owner (guy with tattoos) is awesome but his staff sucks.<//review>

They have tarantulas there too and I couldn't help but notice in one of the Tarantula's substrate had nematodes  (mites) in its enclosure. I brought it to the attention of one of the workers who is oblivious to tarantula husbandry.  He said it was not a big deal and that they were springtails LOL springtails do not look like that.   then he told me not mess with the tarantulas.  Every time I visit their store I always spot at least two things wrong with their tarantulas in their they have the wrong substrate, not enough substrate wrong humidity etc.  I thought that their bad reviews about reptiles were enough but I was certainly wrong that they can't take care of tarantulas either.  I purchased a king baboon and it died a week later from mites stay away from this place like the plague do not buy from this store<//Text>

I have a 6 to 7 inch African Cichlid and a 4 inch one, we went into the store and got a Tiger Oscar. I had no idea if they were friendly together so I asked an employee.  he said it should be fine. Two days later after buying my  tiger Oscar it was bitten up and missing both of its fins.<//Text>

They support you during trying times, and they work with your schedule and understand the different types of situations going on with you and your pet.

Extremely rude.  The receptionist told me to "get off the phone and call someone else because they were too busy to take other customers.  I would avoid such a place if I were you.  She could have referred another place with a better attitude.  I wonder how they treat their patients.< /Text>

<Text>We’ve been going to West Roseville for at least 10 years now. They’ve guided us along during the saddest of times when our dearest doggie got cancer and the happiest times when we got our newest puppy.  Dr. White has always been great and shows true and deep concern when our dogs aren’t feeling their best. She follows up after appointments which we truly appreciate. All of the staff have been great to deal with when getting appointments set up or getting medications filled. During this last year with Covid, the staff comes out to our car and takes our dogs inside. It seemed a little strange to not go inside with our pups but we’ve found it less stressful than waiting in the lobby.  They have found a great balance in still communicating any issues while keeping everyone safe during this year.  We are thankful to have such a caring veterinarian and we rely on her advice to make sure our pups are the healthiest and happiest they can be!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Terrible communication from the staff. First, they couldn't  accommodate  my schedule for a wellness exam for my cat, and then no one explains that you need a wellness exam from their vet in order to get your prescription catfood,  that they now can't get. I took my cat to another vet for the wellness exam who could accommodate my schedule  and West Roseville Veterinary Hospital won't accept that. I'm now stuck trying to get a prescription so I can order my cats food online. This is not the first time they've dropped the ball regarding lack of communication. I won't go back to West Roseville Veterinary Hospital if I  absolutely don't have to. Stay away.< /review>

With COVI protocols in place we are not able to schedule as easily as before and with the increase in pets needing to be seen we are booking out weeks in advance.

We are also at the mercy of the pet food company and their ability to ship us food during COVID.

Our dog had surgery at West Roseville Veterinary Hospital last week and I have to say everything was just wonderful. Dr. R. Williams performed the surgery, the RVT’s were professional and extremely caring. The front office staff was efficient and called to follow up the next day. I recommend this Vet office for routine care, maintenance and surgery. Excellent diagnostic skills!</Text>

<review>I would not recommend this vet. They have not been helpful with offering alternate solutions to health problems my boxer is having. Their quote for surgery was absurdly high. When I declined they seemed to frown upon that and I sought alternate solutions on my own. I did take him back once to refill meds and the fact that he was doing fine seemed to annoy her and the comment was that he's doing better than she expected. I will never go back there and wouldn't recommend them to anyone!<//review><user>117446934367319169003<//user><username>Julia Wilcox<//username><response>{'time': 1567632126488, 'text': 'Hi Julie, I am sorry to hear you have been unhappy with our care.

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Dr. White literally made my cat paralyzed. My cat was walking when we went to their office and when got back home, she was not able to stand up on her own feet. My cat was lethargic and I suggested Dr. White to inject B12 and give oral antibiotic to my elderly cat. I am not a Vet and she should have suggested me that the cat is sick and should not be injected B12, instead, not only she injected B12, but also injected antibiotic, something that I requested oral. Then of course, I got a large bill (which I don't care), however,  the moment we got home, my cat was not able to stand on her own feet and she was paralyzed since and eventually died.

<Review>I appreciated all the great service we have gotten from Dr. Jennifer White. Our cat that was found by my daughter was medically attended by the humane society. After a couple of days we went to see if we could adopt him. We adopted and had him checked out by West Roseville Ve Hospital for a follow up check up. One year later we had him check out again. Best vet service and customer service. Thank You Duran Family & Happy</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The female Dr. White Is very rude and not very nice. Our poor little guy was so anxious and distraught. Instead of letting us calm him down she made it worse by having the staff  hold him down and force the situation. Now we have to medicate him when we take him in and that is best for him because she does not care. We do what is best for him. He gets so upset when we go there, we just cannot anymore. She is horrible. On top of that she charges an arm and a leg for doing Nothing. She spends 5 sec, writes a script and walks out.<//Text><Time>1503710421178< /Time>< username>

The receptionist was rude and caddy. I asked about appointments they didn't have any. I ask for reccomemdation she said that's what Google is for and  calling around. I was plann I'm not from the area. That was the plan next but most local places have reccomemdarion. I hope they do not treat their costumers this way.<//Review>

Found my zen in the desert!
Had a great time at this awesome 50's style bungalow. Well laid out, very well appointed with everything you need to cook, grill, or just relax in the sun in the very nice back yard. Some of the kitchen supplies were better than i have at home! The pool was great, with plenty of floaty toys to lounge on. I've been in many rental properties that felt just like that's what they were...A rental. This felt like a friend gave you the keys to their house for the weekend. I'd go back in a heart beat! We had a great weekend.< /Review>

<time>1563245334421<//time><Text>I have used this rental company twice in the past and I have had nothing but good experiences. The process of renting a home can be a little intimidating but the online process was super easy. I have rented online and I’ve also called and spoken with the courteous staff that was willing to answer any and all my questions. The staff went out of their way and even emailed me a list of available homes within my search criteria. My family and I travel in large groups that include small kids and a dog so you know we need plenty of rooms/beds and plenty of square footage per home. Their website displays a large variety of homes in the Palm Springs/Palm Desert area. Each home has lots of pictures and information detailing each home and it’s features just be sure to actually read the info so you are not disappointed upon arrival. The rental property’s staff appears friendly and seems willing to assist. Each home I have rented has the welcome appeal that my family needs such as gates are unlocked, the AC in the house was already on so my kids walk in to a clean, cool home. I particularly enjoy the quiet, tranquil areas that these homes are in. Overall, this is an excellent rental company with efficient, friendly staff and competitive prices. We always enjoy renting from this place.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is quite honestly one of the worst companies I have ever given money to. I should have researched them before renting, they are 100% unconcerned with the actual *experience* of your stay, they take your money and you better not need or expect anything after that. Their local staff were incredibly rude and totally unconcerned with issues, NEVER called us back when we had multiple issues at the house and at times flat out refused to help. I guess their business must run well on first time renters only, I can't imagine ANYONE would ever rent from these people twice. I know I won't.< /review>< Pics>

Vacation Palm Springs came to the rescue and within a day we had found the perfect house to accommodate this mixed (co-ed, couples, singles) group of ours. Would definitely rent from them again.<//text>< user_id>

I have used the services of this agency several times in the past .... They have increased the prices in a dishonest way.
The house that I rented in October although pretty required urgent renovations. The kitchen's tiles fixed with tape, the bathroom where the walls fall ... I wrote to the agency that does not answer. All they want is your money and do not care about you!
The other detailed comments explain the situation very well!
Be prepared!<//review>

Single worst vacation rental experience ever.  Massively frustrating to reach anyone at Vacation Palm Springs.  Vacasa (national) is limited in what they can do as much as they tried.</Review>

<Review>AVOID this business.

I found their staff very friendly and approachable. However, their systems seem very poor indeed.

We had problems with the pool and spa, from the moment we arrived for about 10 to 14 days. I spoke to about 5 of their staff, all of whom seemed very helpful but none of whom seemed to do anything. Eventually, after I very politely complained, the "manager" phoned me and seemed indignant that I had said we'd had no heated pool for this time, despite having paid a $2000 deposit for it and despite many requests for repair. Also, he seemed to have no idea of the contents of my previous conversations with his team! So, nice people but my experience was of poor management and systems. Eventually, I got into contact with the owners handyman who was the opposite--very quick and efficient.

I was kindly told that I would have compensation for the loss of this important part of my holiday, but when we came to sort out return of my deposit they denied ever having made this offer! Also, no proper accounting or evidence of the actual heating costs deducted from my deposit--and those costs seemed suspiciously extraordinarily high.

AVOID them!<//Review><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>100680415798585692563</UserId.>< Pictures>

I called with a straightforward question about making a reservation. The person I spoke to was polite but seemed to know little about company policies and couldn't answer my question. I was promised a call back with the answer but never received it. I then wrote an email to the company. Same result. No reply. I see that others have experienced similar unresponsiveness.</text>

<rating>1</rating><Response>None< /Response><text>Stayed at this beautiful home with four girlfriends for the weekend. The property was outstanding and we enjoyed it. However, This is the absolute worst management group I have ever run into and I have stayed in many places in many areas. They were horrible. Completely incompetent and had no interest in in serving the client.   They are absolutely awful. I can’t believe the hoops we had to jump through. Most of the information they gave us about the stay was incorrect. I needed to contact them after our stay and was on hold for an hour and a half. I left a couple of items there I needed to get back and they refused to help me. After waiting for an hour and a half on hold I finally got someone who told me they would try but don’t Count on it. I can’t imagine treating clients this way and expecting them to ever deal with you again. I am very disappointed.

<Review>Rented a house for a week; overpriced and the house was in total disrepair.  Leaking faucets, broken cabinets, chipped paint everywhere and a pool heater that we paid for daily and did not work.  Refrigerator water was broken as was the ice machine.  The vacation palm springs office was incompetent and unhelpful.  Although they say 24 hour assistance available, you have to wait on hold sometimes for 15  minutes.  The key code they initially provided us with to enter the home did not work. I had to call and wait until they could give us a new code (got locked out).  When we arrived after our check in time (we arrived at 3:30 and check-in was 3:00) the cleaning service was still there until 4 p.m.  I pointed out the few broken items when we arrived (leaky faucet, refrigerator water/ice access that did not work, etc. ) and when we returned home I received a letter indicating they were charging us an additional $100 dollars for damages  (to be clear, there were no damages and also to be clear they did not specify what was in fact damaged that they were charging us for).  I am grossly disappointed with this experience and this company.  I had intended to rent through them again but this will never happen and I suggest you do not use them either.  The address of the house you should not rent is:  1180 Pasatiempo Road in Palm Springs.  Neighborhood (although in Movie Colony) is sketchy.< /Review><rate>1</rate><Response>None</Response>< Date>

<review>We, 3 couples, booked a house for 3 nights and it was an absolute horror. I have never seen such an unfriendly and incompetent staff.
Because Vacation Palm Springs doesn’t own any of the properties, they write in the rental agreement "Vacation Palm Springs is not liable for nor financially responsible for cancellation of this rental agreement prior to occupancy as a result of, but not limited to, the unexpected sale of the property by owner/lessor or a contract for a property rental that has been discontinued between owner/agent, or unexpected and unlikely mechanical problems or repairs that could make the property unavailable.”
We left after 2 nights, because the house was not completely rebuilt and there was garbage and scrap around. The pool was without water and it smelled terrible.
My friend canceled the amount on the credit card. He explained how we suffered the 2 days and 2 nights. And it worked! Apparently the credit card companies have had already a lot of experience with the company, so they paid the full amount back to the card.
Our advice: do not book, you will only mess up the holidays!</review><Time>1580337253347< /Time>< gmapID>

This business is a SCAM. I booked through VRBO and Vacation Palm Springs canceled my booking. VRBO says they owe me my deposit back but the business refuses to pay. VRBO has disabled their ability to rent that house until I receive payment. I would not trust this business with your money. I will be reporting them.<//review>

<Review>We brought our family out for a holiday getaway and had a great time at Glowing Palms.  It was a standalone house with nice separation from the neighbors that gave us a nice sense of privacy. The house decor was done in a mid century style that had a cool desert vibe. The master was comfy while the guest room had a larger than normal bunk bed which fit our teens well.  We spent lots of time in backyard and enjoyed the spa and fire pit while the pool helped us to cool off in the heat. The house was situated in a great location and everything was close by. It was just 15 minutes to the tram, close to The River (which was awesome) and lots of good golf nearby. All in all, I recommend Vacation Palm Springs and you can't go wrong bringing your family to the Glowing Palms house!</Review><user_name>Chris Hibler<//user_name><Pics>None</Pics><gmap_id>0x80db1bc65d97bae3:0xa107571f6345fae3< /gmap_id><rate>5< /rate></record>

A Sunny Place was a fantastic place to stay!

The private pool / jacuzzi and grassy area in the backyard were wonderful.

The house was nicely decorated and had very comfortable beds in all three of the bedrooms.

The kitchen was well stocked and had everything that we needed during our stay.

The location was central to everything that we wanted to do while in the Palm Springs area.

I would highly recommend this rental.</text>

It's a beautiful two bedroom two bathroom home within a gated/secure community that includes 2 amazing 18 hole golf courses and 3 clubhouses. Excellent community amenities include multiple swimming pools, tennis courts, restaurants, fitness centers, and fun social events. The property management company (Vacation Palm Springs) is also very professional, accommodating, and a pleasure to work with. I highly recommend vacationing at this home.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I don't know whether the grounds or the home is the more impressive.  The house isn't furnished like a vacation rental but instead, a home with panache.  Beautiful furnishings and art, and the kitchen was a dream with just about everything imaginable.  The yard is a real wow from the moment you open the gate and in the back, a great pool with all the bells and whistles.  And ultra modern the pool still has an old fashioned depth so during the hot summer, the water was just right to swim and cool off in.  We found the neighborhood very quiet but still very walkable into town and a short walk to some great Palm Springs hotels and hot spots.  I recommend Kara Mia highly, a great get-away to relax and spoil yourself; we plan to be back.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Vacation Palm Springs offers the BEST customer service I have ever encountered. From managing the rental home details to our specifications to happily retrieving the gate opener when I forgot it in my rental car, their team went above and beyond to ensure that our stay 3-week stay was carefree and enjoyable. Kudos to Brit and the rest of this awesome team!< /Review>

<review>Vacation Palm Springs manages our vacation rental, lovingly named "Shooting Star" because of all the great star-gazing we do in Palm Springs.  They make it super easy for us to not only feel that our house is being well-cared for and maintained, but are running a top notch operation that ensures we stock our house properly for guests and things run smoothly during the stays for both us and guests.  It's great working with them!</review>< Pictures>

Very chic, classy and elegant home
This home had all the comfortably and cleanliness that is necessary for a couple of family who wants to spend outside their home but feel it is their own home. It has all the kitchen appliances new, nice and clean, the bedrooms were big and beautiful. The backyard was paradise. Only my suggestion is to make a bathroom with a stand up shower in the backyard. Furthermore, put a couple of umbrella or shade areas for day time, and put a little more lights for night time. Overall, it was very chic and elegant. We had fun and everything was excellent</Text>

<Review>This was the perfect place for a bridal getaway. We had 12 girls here and we all fit comfortably in this beautiful house. The living space is HUGE, lots of room to chill out and watch TV or cook in the gourmet kitchen. It has TWO full size ovens so it made cooking for a big group really easy. The pool is so private you forget that the house is in a neighborhood! Two of the bedrooms are almost like a different house so it would be a great place for a couple of families looking for a vacation together. The ping pong table was an added bonus and having a washer/dryer was great for all of the wet towels. All of the bathrooms made you feel like you were at a spa. It was so nice!! As we left all of the girls said they wanted to come back as soon as possible! Thank you again for everything!”<//Review><rating>5< /rating>< Pics>

<text>I gave them 2 stars because even though the house we stayed at had many positives like being fully stocked ,nice, big (3beds 3bath) and clean their customer service isn't the greatest.. we stayed from Thursday through Saturday and on Friday while getting ready to head out into down town for dinner, one of the toilets got clogged water started coming out from underneath the toilet and started flowing out the shower tub, filling it with nasty water, I called customer service and a girl said they would send someone out. 30-45 minutes went by and no one had yet to show up so I called again, I asked if she had any information on the ETA of the plumber and she said that usually over the weekend (it was Friday around 5pm) was always harder to find someone available and said she had no information whatsoever about when and how much longer we'd had to wait. It was then when I asked if it was safe to use the other restrooms to shower because we had dinner reservations and we needed to finish getting ready she said no because they were afraid of backing up the other restrooms, understandable, but what do we do? the rest of the house (the other half that wasn't ready) had to shower and we couldn't, just wait around until someone showed up time was running out and we were going to miss our dinner reservations so we had to finish showering outside in the backyard with the water hose! (we ended up missing the reservations) the plumber showed up about an hour later and he suggested we just go out to dinner anyways because it would be a while before he'd finish The toilet was so clogged because there was roots in the tubes! and worked on the toilet for almost 3 hours! During which the house reeked of plumbing and waste we understand that situations like that are inevitable and hard to determine but I called to complain the next day (Saturday) after checking out to talk to someone In charge and get at least a night refunded because of the huge inconvenience we had to go through the guy that answered told me the guy I would need to talk to wasn't there and wouldn't be back until Monday so he forwarded me to his machine which just ended up hanging up on me so I waited and called back in Monday when the girl I talked to said that he was still out and wouldn't be back until Tuesday and that he would call me first thing in the morning it is not Wednesday almost a week after our stay and NO ONE has contacted me!  I don't think I'll ever book anything through them again.. you book a house and immediately they require a deposit and then required to pay the full amount a month before the date and yet they take forever to call back after situations like these happen horrible customer service and no regard about anything after they're paid! we couldn't even use that restroom for the rest of the time there because that's just nasty and unsanitary but they don't care all they want is your money once they have that you don't matter</text>< pics>

Found the review! I tried posting but couldn't so could this guy just post it for me?

I had a fantastic time at KaraMiya. It was perfect for 2 weeks away from rainy Seattle! Close to the city but where one can escape to the backdrop of the serene hills of .....
Great location to just have casual walks at dusk around a neighborhood showcasing homes at the height of the mid-century modern era.

However this home was built in the .... And even with all the updates, it feels I stepped back in time to the 1930's.

The spacious for four bedroom hacienda cottage had everything we needed. Especially loved the comfortable beds, and the privacy of this home. Everything you need is there! Great to be able to walk into the city, walk across to the park, to restaurants around the corner - and to have the tram stop close by. Highly recommended!</Review>

"The house was incredible. From the moment we arrived we were thoroughly impressed. The house is spacious enough and such an entertainment house. I celebrated my 41st birthday with some very close friends and we all just had an amazing time in this home and of course the beautiful backyard. Everyone loved the place as much as we did and I can see us going back real soon. The team at Vacation Palm Springs was ALL very helpful. Thank you to Davis and Todd for your recommendations. I would absolutely recommend vacation Palm Springs."

<text>What can make or break a vacation management company is their level of service.  On that area Vacation Palm Springs has proven to me they're doing it right.  Everyone I've interacted with has had a great attitude and are willing to really help you out.  Whether you're a vacationer looking for a great spot or a homeowner wanting to list your property, definitely give them a look.< /text>< user_name>

<Text>If there was a 0 star I would gladly put zero. This company is a rip off. We had guests from Russia and we wanted to entertain. We booked through Vacation Palm Springs by just looking at the pictures that they posted on the website. As soon as we walked in we had a total opposite of what we saw on the pictures. We were disgusted and disappointed. The place was DIRTY, no maintenance at all. Beds were covered with animal hair, TV was not working and had a blury screen. Couches were ripped. (I have all the pictures and videos for reference). When I went to see the manager the only thing that she suggested was to call a cleaning crew. I was ashamed of my guests who were supposed to wait outside in 110 degrees until they figured out what they could do. I am going to report this place for not taking full responsibility and for stealing money by posting wrong and not real pictures. If you want to rent a house just go to VRBO. It’s a better website.<//Text>< Name>

<text>ZERO stars. All the reviews are true do not rent from this company. Nothing but scammers. They try to milk as much money out of you with all these extra charges and fraudulent claims. They try to find any reason to evict you even though you are within the rules. Worst experience ever from a rental company. Do not ever rent from them!</text></record>

Amazing! Clean and New, 10 stars all the way! We rented "Glamorous Getaway" for the long weekend and loved how new everything was and how modern the rooms and house overall was decorated. Everything just felt so clean and new! Massive living room/common area, more than enough couches. Sound system to the pool was fun. Kitchen fully stocked, floaties for the pool, and the beds were ultra-comfortable. Perfect location: 15-20 minutes to the malls and outlets, and only a few minutes to the airport AND down-town Palm Springs. Our girls getaway exceeded all expectations. We needed and appreciated the many bathrooms and mirrors. Just the best, THANK YOU!
Everyone I dealt with at Vacation Palm Springs was great - quick and responsive”</Review>

I think highly of Vacation Palm Springs as a rental company.  They've worked carefully to manage the property and to make sure the guest experience is superb.  If you're considering listing your home with them, take the time to learn about what it takes to make a property successful as a vacation rental.  They're very knowledgeable and will guide you through the process.

< review>
Horrible business practices! In August 2017 I booked a rental house through Vacation Palm Springs for 5 days in April 2018. Now it's February 2018 and they cancelled the reservation on me, with only two months notice.

They haven't refunded my deposit yet, they haven't offered me any discount on another purchase and they refuse to accept blame. They cite that the homeowner sold his property and therefore they have absolutely no obligation to honor our existing rental contract. If I had cancelled on them I would still be charged 10% of the original contract; but apparently it is okay when they cancel on me instead. I put over $1,000 down on a deposit for a $4,200 rental agreement for a 5 bedroom property.

I will never ever use this company or recommend this company to anyone for any reason. They will ruin your vacation last minute and act like it's your fault.

Email message from Bunnie @ Vacation Palm Springs:
"The home you reserved [RENTAL HOME NAME] is no longer available for your dates.  The was sold.  I know that this is disappointing, but I am here to help.  Listed below are 5 bedroom homes that are open and available for your dates.  My contact information is listed below I will be in the office tomorrow morning from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm.  If you should see a home that you are interested please email me or you call me at the number listed tomorrow."

EDIT UPDATE:
Yes, Vacation Palm Springs did offer alternative houses - but not a single one of the alternatives they proposed matched the dates I had chosen. IE Every alternative they offered up would have me leaving a day earlier than was possible, and because I was in Palm Springs for a work trip, this was not an option. So in short, no, Vacation Palm Springs did not offer appropriate alternatives.

Further, the five alternatives that were sent to me clearly stated the daily rental rate, which was much higher than my original booking and out of my budget. I don't know if Vacation Palm Springs would have honored the original rates for the nicer rental homes, but when we are talking about a difference in the $2,000 to $6,000 range, it needs to be described to me, up front, that they would have honored that original booking rate. Explaining to me over Google Reviews that they would have honored the original rate is not acceptable.

Lastly, Yes, it is not in the terms and conditions of Vacation Palm Springs to guarantee availability of a property even when booked in advance. So, when I booked a property 9 months in advance and it was sold 2 months before my stay - they are not responsible nor liable based on their terms and conditions. This does not put the customer first, or guarantee an excellent experience.

Had I been offered realistic alternatives (IE alternative 5 bedroom rentals for the full duration of my intended stay) and been instructed that they would have honored the original price (instead of listing the higher rental price in their email) this would have been a 4 star listing. Instead, I was left with alternatives that didn't fit my schedule, or were out of my budget, and I had to frantically search for my own alternative houses for me and my 5 guests for our stay - the week before Coachella. I stand by my 1-star review because I feel that is what Vacation Palm Springs deserves. I was left without a rental home on short notice for one of the busiest weeks of the year, and was not treated promptly and fully with the respect I feel is deserved when booking a $4,200 rental home.</review>

I reserved an active listing for Memorial Day weekend and paid full price. About a week and a half prior to my stay, I receive  an email from VacationPalmSprings saying that the house that I reserved is no longer available because it has had a leak which will not be fixed by my stay date. They offered me two other houses to choose from on the same days. I chose one of the other houses, and received a confirmation email. 4 days prior to memorial weekend, I get a call from Britt at VacationsPalmSprings saying that this house is also no longer available because the owner is using it and the only thing that he can do is refund me the money. I've had family come across country for memorial weekend and this has been the worst experience I've ever had. It is unacceptable to treat customers like this and be so careless. I would not recommend anyone to go through this website or have any type of affiliation with them. Horrible service, a nightmare to deal with this company, and you never know what's coming next.< /text>

Everyone there has been so extremely helpful and they take such good care of our home and the guests who stay there as well as any requests we have. Because of them, we can really enjoy ourselves while visiting our Palm Springs home and have complete confidence that all is well when we're away.

<response>None</response><Text>Let me begin by saying this company sent me a review form right after our departure in which I shared the following concerns and asked them to contact me by today-January 5, 2019-one week post departure if they did not want me to post on social media and contact the BBB.  I was sure they would want to address this privately and gave them the opportunity to do so. Nothing...not even an acknowledgement.  At the same time I posted the same review  information on the "El Paseo Modern" house we had rented directly on their website and waited for it to appear.  Of course, it did not.  Then it hit me...they only post positive reviews, which is why this house had not had a review posted for 6 months.

In their original inquiry, they asked what one thing would have made our stay better.  Here was my response: "It would be more like a dozen things that needed change and, moreover, required a great deal of assertiveness on our parts to have even some of them addressed on the 22nd (the day we checked in) versus the 26th (the day after Christmas)----which your staff stated was "because we are so busy and it is the holidays" which, of course, had we not pushed back, would have been more than half way through our stay.  The top dozen were: 1) pool and jacuzzi not heating or draining properly and not chlorinated properly, 2) gate code never worked, 3) ice maker not working, 4) trash compactor broken, 5) outside TV ripped off wall, 6) 4 of the outside lounges slashed and unusable, 7) dining room light broken, 8) no refrigerated water, 9) outside awning broken therefore no shade,10) BBQ hood missing left side screws so unusable for outside grilling 11) two of the dining room chairs unstable to sit in, 12) and refrigerator doors not closing properly (freezer had been left open upon our arrival because of this issue and all the ice trays melted).  Everywhere we looked during our first few hours of settling in, we found more things in poor condition and unaddressed maintenance issues.

When I finally got very firm with Alexis and Jade, which should not be necessary when we have paid top dollar and agreed to all terms thus fulfilling our end of the bargain, they sent Jose to "save the day"...he did as much as he could to bring things into the best working order on a Saturday night (we gave him a sizable tip for his efforts because of his work ethic and sincerity). However, many things remained undone because Jose's resources were limited---he could not fix an expensive awning or replace and rehang an expensive TV.

Our issue then became false advertising...both in photos and in print (we kept copies of what we were told we were getting from your website) given that we were told we would have all of these amenities, yet many were not there...yes, that is fraudulent...if things change with a rental home, you MUST amend your advertising or you must offer a rebate or the chance for us to cancel and be placed in a similar home close by...neither was done or offered. You do the owners an injustice (I do hope they themselves read this) if you do not manage their property within these ethical and legal boundaries.  The owners actually have a potentially lovely property, but they deserve to know what is being left undone and we deserve to have full disclosure if we are not going to get what was advertised and what we paid for. All of this was unfair, stressful, and really poor business practice on  "Vacation Palm Springs" company's part. I recommend you have full "informed consent", having toured and walked any property you are interested in renting, prior to doing so.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Update: On 1/11/2017, Justin Vasquez wrote to the Better Business Bureau the following: "After further review of your reservation, I would like to extend the guest service fee and booking fee that remains. The total comes to $114.81." Consequently, we expected to have this sum refunded to us. However, on 2/1, we received a note stating: "It appears that there was a miscommunication in regards to the refund that you received." In other words, they decided to renege on their word and not refund us the small amount remaining.

Future customers should know that this company's word is not good, and they should take their business elsewhere.

Extremely disappointing. We have rented from them before, and were very happy. For a long weekend, we decided to rent the property on East Francis, and it is a disaster. In no particular order, the hot water did not work in one of the showers, the pool has dead leaves and dirt in the water, the walls are filled with dings, the carpets are stained, the AC did not properly cool, and the back yard furniture was stained and ratty. A coffee table was missing a slat. Altogether unappealing and totally unlike the other rentals.

Worst of all, when asked to move us to an alternative property, refund us one night, or provide some sort of small compensation for our disappointment and discomfort, the company did nothing other than send out a repairman for the hot water and the AC. The latter unsuccessfully, as the unit still does not cool properly.

So be warned. While some of their properties are excellent, customer service is clearly not their strong suit. I doubt we will be using this company ever again.</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Vacation Palm Springs recommended we stay at this beautifully designed home in Rancho Mirage called "Desert Vacation Paradise". This newly remodeled Mediterranean/Modern home has four king beds and was far more than we ever dreamed of. From the Spanish tile floors with cobalt blue corners, to the giant showers with cobalt blue glass walls. The modern Vessel Tub looking out to the garden was an extra bonus. The furniture throughout the house was perfect, especially the impressive bedroom sets in the two master bedroom suites. The pool area has built in rock furniture and is surrounded by majestic Washingtonian and Queen palms, citrus trees, and hundreds of beautiful cactus on a full acre. The separate guest cottage was like another home and was decorated with a variety of fun glasses, dishes, and collector vases. There are four separate patios with umbrellas and very comfortable outdoor wicker furniture. The entire home is decorated with high quality photos of the Golden Era movie stars which made this an authentic Palm Springs experience. The staff at Vacation Palm Spring was very helpful and showed us how to turn on all the garden, palm tree, and pool lights to make the evenings like an enchanting Disneyland experience. This was the best vacation we ever had and this property is truly a “Desert Vacation Paradise”.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Spent 6 weeks in HIDDEN ESCAPE -I would not advise anyone staying here.It was a total disaster .The owners rely on a property manager who is not only RUDE but does not do his job.The lawn and pool maintenance were the worst i ever experienced in Palm Springs.
As for VACATION PALM SPRINGS-only ONE man-(after speaking to a myriad of employees there) tried to rectify the problems . He was a cut above the other employees and THE ONLY REASON I AM NOT HIRING A LAWYER RIGHT NOW!
VPS HAS TOO MANY HOMES AND NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE SUCH AS JERRY TO PROPERLY SEE THAT THEY ARE READY FOR PRIME TIME!
I CANNOT GIVE THIS 6 WEEK EXPERIENCE ANY STARS.(HAD TO GIVE STAR TO GET PUBLISHED!)< /Review>< pics>

<review>We rented a property called "Sleek Retreat" in the Racquet Club area for five weeks in Feb/March 2018.
A nice house that needs to be freshened up. It's tired.
The carpets in all three bedrooms were filthy and heavily stained.
A towel rack was obviously torn from the wall in the main bathroom and the patch job appeared to have been done by a six year old.
The outdoor, fire pit furniture was well beyond it's "best before" date.
However our main complaint was the pool heater.
It rarely worked. We phoned the Palm Springs office on four occasions when we wanted to heat the pool and the heater didn't work. The first three times they sent someone around later in the day and the employee managed to get it working. Always too late in the day to actually use the pool as it takes some time to heat. On the final occasion I attended the office and demanded that they actually have the problem addressed by someone who could fix it as opposed to merely getting it temporarily running. I was told that I would be the top priority.
When no one had arrived four hours later, I phoned again, quite upset and they finally sent someone who fixed the heater. Once again too late to use that day.
When we checked out on March 15 we complained to a manager who said we would receive some credit for these issues.
We were charged an upfront deposit of $1,850 to cover gas/electrical we consumed during our stay, with the unused portion to be refunded.
Well, here it is a month later and we still haven't received our unused power refund back. Power consumption can be viewed in real time on the web. Pretty simple process.
We also paid an upfront cleaning fee of $225 for a house that we left much cleaner than we found when we arrived.
We have contacted the Palm Springs office a few times since we left and have been met with a lack of concern bordering on rudeness.
We also have placed calls to the company head office in New Jersey and they don't return calls, at least to us.
All in all, an experience that makes it highly unlikely that we will ever use the services of this company again.
We were also asked to review the property but I see that hasn't been posted which makes me feel they probably only post positive reviews associated with the specific properties.
As such, anyone relying on their posted reviews to assist in the decision to rent a property should be very cautious.

We love Palm Springs and stay in our house ("Palm Springs Dreams") whenever we can.  The city has a great vibe, very friendly, and we love the celebration of all things mid-century! Our house is an original Paul Trousdale plan 6 in a beautiful area, close to downtown (Tahquitz River Estates) with a great private back yard and pool, original design, great indoor/outdoor living, solid construction and insulation - great space to enjoy the PS vibe..  Also, Vacation Palm Springs has been fantastic to work with and do a great job managing the property, making sure everything is well taken care of well presented when we're not there.<//text>

I am following up on my stay at the Poseidon house. When we got to the office to check in with a manager, we were told we would absolutely be fined and evicted from the house if we played ANY music at ANY time both indoors or outdoors. This should have been communicated to us prior to renting as we were only told that we could not play music outdoors after 10pm. When we finally got to the house itself, the pool was filthy, the trash cans were full and overflowing, one of the toilets was leaking water onto the bathroom floor, the oven door was completely shattered so we could not cook the dinner we had already bought to cook that night, and there was no hot water in the master shower. I called the Vacation Palm Springs office immediately to request help and it took HOURS for anyone to come to the house. We spent weeks planning for this trip for for my sister's bachelorette party and the amenities and conditions were quite a letdown. Overall it was a very disappointing experience and I would not recommend renting a Vacation Palm Springs home to anyone.< /Review>

LOVE this house! So much fun! The location is perfect: equidistant to Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage, and Palm Desert, 20 minutes from Coachella. This area is so incredibly peaceful: you can get to all of the busy events of the Valley, then retire to your peaceful escape on the hill. You don't get views like this from many places. Literally, the only sounds you hear are the birds and the wind in the palm trees. The pool was thoughtfully designed and is great for having family and friends. The feeling that this house emits is a great, fun energy that allows me and my family to escape the toils and tribulations of everyday life. THANK YOU!< /text>

We have been using Vacation Palm Springs for our vacation rental for nearly two years, and we are extremely happy. The staff is friendly, helpful, and attentive, and the bookings have been solid and beyond our income producing expectations. Truly the best vacation rental company in the Coachella Valley.< /review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>I've had nothing but wonderful experiences renting from Vacation Palm Springs. In the several years I've rented, the homes have been very clean and were well-suited to our vacation needs.

The unexpected occasionally happens with 1950's mid-century modern homes, and thats when I really appreciated Vacation Palm Springs dedication to serving their guests. While staying in one such home the pool heater went to it's final reward (it died), and before the water had cooled a brand new heater was installed. We were very pleased with their response and the offer to make things right.

After renting for a while we eventually decided to become owners, and currently have one of our properties listed with Vacation Palm Springs. We talked with other companies before coming back to Vacation Palm Springs. They have the resources and personnel to take care of practically anything.

Everyone from Britt Cheek to Nathan Jordan to Davis Meyer to so many others, have made working with Vacation Palm Springs (as a guest or owner) a great experience!< /Text><date>1413844680345</date></record></dataset><record>

Everyone has been great to work with and, when the unfortunate happens, VPS is there to help coordinate the repair folks.

I recommend them.</Review>< pics>

For the money paid, the house itself is far from the stated 4.5 start rating!!! Old and stinky furniture, kitchen, silverware, towels, etc...but the BLOODY  LINENS were the highlight of our trip. CHEAP and extremely uncomfortable mattresses in every bedroom. Dirty pool and hot tub.
We had a terrible experience and nobody could relax on the trip because of the constant lingering feeling of dirty and repulsive environment.

<Review>The house we rented through Vacation Palm Springs was far less than we expected for the price.  The house, titled "Palm Springs Pool Home" is an older home in the Movie Colony neighborhood.  The house is in shabby condition with lots of deferred maintenance, uncomfortable beds, old furniture, etc.  We also didn't realize that there is a good amount of crime in this neighborhood, especially at rental properties (we got robbed).  Vacation Palm Springs was not all helpful in terms of helping us through the robbery.

On the plus side, the Movie Colony is centrally located (you can walk to downtown) and things at the house basically worked.</Review>< Resp>

We tried unsuccessfully to rent an adequate place from this company and they were completely unhelpful. We reserved our first choice and then later we were told that it was no longer available. We were offered another place that did not fit our needs. Then they offerred a slightly more expensive place at the original price that we accepted but again we were later notified that they had withdrawn that offer. Finally we were offered a shabby, outdated place that looked like my grandmother had just moved out. We tried to get they to do something for us but the office manager adamantly refused.
I would never rent from. Them. They also have more expensive cleaning and other fees than other companies
If you look through the reviews some of the houses are fine but the rental/management company seems to be a disaster. I would certainly agree.<//text>

My wife and I have used them many times and mostly our experience has been good but the last time we were a group of 11 and rented a very large estate in rancho mirage. The home was a disappointment in many ways and we felt it didn't live up to the description as found on Vacation Palm Springs web site. Three months have passed and the, in our opinion, misleading description hasn't changed I have to tell you we did complain and we did receive a small refund. We wrote a review of this home for there web site which they didn't publish. We suspect that they are selective in choosing the reviews you are able to see when choosing a rental. Prior to this experience we have phoned and talked about our needs and rented the homes that were suggested with a much better outcome.< /Text>

Good times
Loved this place. The rooms were nice, the pool is a perfect size and it was very quiet, private and a great time.
Sergio was fantastic.</review>

<text>The home was wonderful! It was just perfect for my family. Not too small or too big, just right. The Location, Master bedroom, Backyard and Pool, were all just great! The kitchen was fully stocked and the bathrooms were very clean. We can't wait to visit again!
All of the staff whom I spoke with were very professional and considerate! Portia was stellar, her customer service rocks! She was most helpful with booking the Casa De Agua location. During our stay, we locked ourselves out of the house and without hesitation; the gentleman on call extremely understood the situation and assisted us promptly with retrieving the key. Then on our last day, I got really sick and had to go to Urgent Care unfortunately, which put us behind with leaving the home later than 5pm. When the Property Manager arrived, he was the sweetest! He was totally sympathetic to our situation. When I offered to show my medical forms, he was more concerned about my health. This made our experience even better! The entire staff couldn't be better than what they already are; they serviced our needs with 110%!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Great Week at Mesa Midcentury
The Mesa Midcentury House had a great location and very nice style. Perfect Palm Springs week.  Vacation Palm Springs is nice to work with. Very professional and easy to work with. We had a small issue at the property which we called about and it was promptly taken care of.  We would highly recommend Vacation Palm Springs for a wonderful vacation experience in Palm Springs.< /text>

< Review>
We rented the Royal Sun Villa house for a 3 day weekend bachelorette party. We had 15 girls staying in the house and the house was absolutely perfect to all spread out in. Everyone had a bed to sleep in with 6 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms. The pool and spa were both a great size. The website stated that there were pool floats, but we could not locate any... luckily, we brought our own to blow up anyway. There were plenty of lounge chairs and patio tables outside too. The only real downside to the backyard was that there was almost no shade at all. There was no patio cover and there weren't umbrellas available, so after a day in the pool the direct sun can start to take a little bit of a toll.

Customer service all the way up to the day of check in was great. They were responsive with requests and getting my reservation made. Justin was very helpful from the beginning. The week of I emailed a couple of times asking questions about items that were available in the house and did not receive a response. I decided to call and my questions were answered right away, along with an apology for not receiving a response email. After check in when we had issues and called, the staff was very still helpful and polite - however, we did have an ongoing issue that was never resolved out of the 3 days we were there. When we showed up on Friday morning, we had an early check- in of 10:00 am and the pool was very dirty so I called the office first thing to let them know about it. I was told that someone would be showing up and they were already on the schedule to be there for Friday. No one ever showed up on Friday, so on Saturday morning we decided to call again about the pool and also because there weren't any instructions on how to turn on the jacuzzi. We were assured that it was a misunderstanding and someone would be definitely showing up Saturday morning as soon as possible. Again, no one showed up, so by late Saturday afternoon, I called and finally spoke with Nate who tried to walk me through how to turn on the jacuzzi, which were able to figure out thankfully. He also told me there were detailed instructions in the welcome binder with how to turn on the jacuzzi, but there were not but between Nate’s instructions and trying to figure out myself, it worked out. I was told they were sending out the "emergency" pool guy to come out but he still never showed up. Just a little frustrating because they were great with customer service to speak with on the phone and everyone was helpful the whole time, but it was upsetting to call three separate times and not get it taken care of. Also, since then I have emailed customer service and also submitted a review to their website online and have not heard anything back at all, which I would have expected by now as it has been over a week.

Overall, we still really enjoyed our trip and the house, but considering they haven't even responded to my emails just letting them know the issues that were never taken care of, I'm not sure I would still choose to rent from this company again. That is also why I decided to put the review as a 1 out of 3.< /Review>

<Text>We've used Vacations Palm Springs many times over the years. We've stayed at wonderful properties, without issue. Mother's day weekend we stayed at another property, which was so bad that we ended up staying at Marriott Villas at night, and using the properties backyard/pool during the day. We contacted VPS and they couldn't help us. Once we returned from our trip we at least felt that others could learn from our mistake by being able to leave a detailed account of what we felt was wrong with the property. After leaving the review and waiting a few days we called VPS to ask why it wasn't being displayed. We found out then that VPS selectively decides which reviews they want to display. In my opinion it's dishonest and that is why I am leaving a two star review. We should be able to see all the good and all the bad. It may have pushed us to another property and we might have had a better experience. Property owners shouldn't be protected by having bad reviews buried, they should work hard to compete with other owners and make their properties the best that they can be. If this practice changes in the future I will reconsider. Until then we are reluctant to use VPS again and will look elsewhere.

We stayed at "Happy Hour Hideaway" in Palm Springs< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80db1bc65d97bae3:0xa107571f6345fae3<//gmap_id></record>

Stayed a few days with a bunch of friends, and expectations were exceeded. The staff was very friendly and, and it was worth a little extra instead of staying in a hotel. They care about the customers experience and for that, we will be returning in the winter.< /text>

<Review>My family and I booked a rental through Vacation Palm Springs for Thanksgiving.  We put down a deposit.  My very elderly grandmother who lives overseas fell terminally ill a few weeks beforehand and we had to cancel because my mom had to fly home.  Right after this happened, I spoke to Nate Heape, who is nice enough, and he represented that if they were able to re rent the unit, then they would refund more of our deposit rather than penalize us the $279 cancellation fee (including tax).  In other words, he was being reasonably compassionate about the situation.

Fast forward a few weeks later, I called up shortly before Thanksgiving and another week ago because they were able to rent out the place for the same time period.  Despite this, they are going back on their word that we would be receiving an additional refund since they were able to rent out the place.

My issue is not with the cancellation policy.  But the fact that made fraudulent representations, in what appeared to be a reasonable gesture of good faith and human compassion for the situation and they are now going back on their word.

It's disappointing to say that least.  My mom was just talking yesterday about how we would rent again through them based on goodwill, but today's email from Nate reneging what he had previously agreed to ensure that this will not be the case.

Not good business practices (i.e. greedy, since they were able to rent out the place for the time period at issue).< /Review>< response>

VACATION PALM SPRINGS!!!! I have gone through many vacation rental places in my lifetime but this was absolutely the worst experience I have ever had. We rented the property called the gem for three days. The property was dirty and many objects that would be very easy to fix or replace were left broken all around house. Even the furniture was barely hanging together by giant pinch clips. We were not informed of a noise ordinance in Palm Springs that said we could not listen to music at any time including during the day until we arrived at check in. When we got there, the fridge was broken and we had to wait four house for a replacement fridge arrive. We had to leave the house to get ice and keep everything in ice chests the entire first night. Not only that but they never took the old fridge and just dumped the replacement fridge in the middle of kitchen. We heard the guy who delivered fridge drop it in the parking lot and came out to see he hit a friends car with the fridge and put a huge dent in the door. The management would not take responsibility for this and didn’t even care to attempt to seem apologetic. Since we nearly had all of our food spoiled on the first night, we asked if the property managers would kindly turn on the pool heater and spa to make up for loss, as they had to both be rented separately before check in (completely ridiculous in itself for what we paid to rent the house). When the gentleman came to drop off the fridge he attempted to heat the pool and spa and left, informing us it would take about three hours to heat. It was already late so we didn’t have a chance to even use the pool or spa. But to our dismay it never heated anyway. They informed us someone would be back at the house around 7am to repair our original fridge. When 10am rolled around and no one had been on contact with us, we called again to have someone return to heat the spa and pool, as we were promised. They said they would send someone as soon as they could. At almost 5pm we still had no one contact us and had to call again. The woman on site was completely argumentative with me and refused to provide any decent service so I had to speak to a manager who also did absolutely nothing but try to tell me we were some how in the wrong and it was a courtesy they were doing for us so we shouldn’t have high expectations. COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS. They again attempted to have someone come out, again very late on our last night and continuously told me I wouldn’t be able to speak to an owner until Monday which would have been a day after our check out. When the second gentleman came to try to turn the pool and spa heater on he told us they were both broken and we wouldn’t be able to use either! So even if we would have paid for the option from the start we wouldn’t have been able to use it. He apologized and said he would let the property managers know and someone would be in contact with us. At no surprise at all we didn’t from anyone again the remainder do the trip. I was so infuriated and just wanted to avoid contact with them, as I had already wasted a span of three hours with the office on the phone during my vacation. I recommended not using these services at all and I hope the owner of the home take their rental services to a new company and really hope they don’t know what the condition of their home is in because it was anything but acceptable. I always have a great experience with VRBO and HomeAway and have definitely learned my lesson.< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80db1bc65d97bae3:0xa107571f6345fae3<//gmapID></record>

<Text>I recently stayed at the Villa Grand in Palm Spring, which was the original Christina O’nassis vacation home and is managed by Vacation Palm Springs.  I started my search for the best celebrity home on Google and was lucky to find this one.  After visiting the Vacation Palm Springs site, which may I add is fantastic and very user friendly, I decided to call and obtain some additional information.  From the moment that I called to the day I departed, everything was great.  The reservations team was extremely knowledgeable and assisted me with everything that I needed including, helping me find a great chef for a private dinner.

We had to call the main office during our stay, as we needed 2 tennis racquets to utilize the sport court; Britt, the property manager had them to us in less than an hour!  I have to commend this company on their attention to detail and the superb customer service.  I look forward to renting one of their other celebrity homes in the near future and would highly recommend their services to anyone who is use to 5 star treatment!

Thank you Vacation Palm Springs!

We stayed at "Casa Vista Cat City" and it was a lovely property nestled in the hills just minutes from downtown Palm Springs. It was super quiet and a lovely heated salt water pool and a nifty roof deck with an amazing view of the mountains and the valley. I would highly recommend this property. As for VPS the staff was super nice and professional and the property was spotless and clean when we got there.

If you're gonna rent in the Palm Springs Area, VPS is the way to go. Just give them a call and tell them what you're looking for or go to their site.

Looking forward to staying at "Casa Vista Cat City" again sometime over the winter!<//Review>

We rented a property in La Quinta -- chosen for its stunning backyard amenities and proximity to the Tennis Garden for the BNP Paribas Open. The interior of the home was comfortable (if a little dated). Unfortunately, for us, the pool heater was broken, and we were not able to use the pool. Even though I had to hound the Vacation Palm Springs team daily to address the broken pool heater, Mike S. did make a yeoman's effort to get it resolved during our stay. The pool heater was replaced but not in time for us to use the pool. My feedback to VPS was to offer us an alternate property with the serviceable amenities we were counting on (swimming pool) because they knew the heater was broken before our arrival. It was a busy time of year and other properties were not available according to VPS. At the end of the day, our vacation was special even with the hiccups. I would cautiously recommend Vacation Palm Springs and would like to try using them for future trips to the area.</Text>

Vacation Palm Springs booked us a condo on Feb. 8, 2016 for occupancy to begin on December 9. We booked well in advance, knowing how difficult it is to make winter reservations at the last minute. On October 6, as a result of a routine call by me to VPS, we learned that we had no reservation, despite the fact that we had a written contract, a confirming email and had paid  a deposit. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE.

We arrived to be told "we" had changed our online booking date, which we hadn't. We were informed that as the house we booked was no longer available we would get an upgrade. The "upgraded" house was in poor condition.The staff member was rude and unhelpful. Would not stay again.</text>

<gmapID>0x80db1bc65d97bae3:0xa107571f6345fae3< /gmapID><review>My party of 5 rented the Tropical Retreat home during Fourth of July weekend.  We could have rented way cheaper but we decided to shell out more for a "nicer" place.  What a disappointment this place was.

First, the outdoor space was spacious.  However, if people are renting a home during the hot summer you would assume the outdoor area would be somewhat clean right?  Wrong.  The patio furniture -- and I mean ALL of them -- had a thick layer of dust and dirt.  I get that it's dusty and windy but didn't they have people cleaning and straightening right before we arrived?  The pool was a disgusting mess.  Forget the leaves and debris from the surrounding area -- we played poolman and fished all that out ourselves.  But there was a DEAD LIZARD at the bottom of the pool!!  I have the photo to prove it.

Second, there was a giant...and I mean GIANT roach in one of the bathrooms which I had my fiancé dispose of before the rest of my family arrived (also have photo proof of this as well).  Unfortunately that was just the start of our bug/critter problems.  In total, we found and removed at least 10 crickets and other rather large and sometimes flying insects in the house over the weekend.  Nothing like listening to cricket sounds IN the room you are trying to sleep in.

Third, the sheets in each of the three bedrooms were stained.  Thumbs up for consistency.  My fiancé was so grossed out he slept ABOVE the sheets, in full clothes and used his hoody as a blanket.  My brother contemplated sleeping on the couch until we disposed of a couple critters found in that area too.

The only nice thing about this craphole was the washer and dryer.  We were so obsessed with cleaning this alleged "Tropical Retreat" that we washed, dried and folded about 98% of the towels that belonged to the house.  So let's see, we shelled out almost $1,300 (supposedly $250 is refundable so more like $1050) for two nights at a dirty, moldy, bug infested home where WE ended up washing THEIR towels for them.  Who got the better end of that "bargain"?  I'll give you a hint.  NOT US.

Fair warning -- do NOT be fooled by photos!  AND be careful because Vacation Palm Springs for the most part only seems to post positive reviews.< /review><response>None<//response>< time>

Kevin the so called manager needs to change his tune..he's a horrible manager. Instead of making it right for the customer he engages in child like behavior, so rude...these employees are not happy employees..cheese bread is always good..that's about it...you want good pizza go to Ravelos formerly known as Bollini's on Garfield and Riggin in Monterey Park. Pesto bread is delicious!!<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>The manager and employee were arguing with saying that the address they have on file was different however we ordered on the app and the address was correct. The management was very rude yelling at me when I already told her that their store was the one I ordered from told her multiple times it was. When asked to cancel she yelled yet again that she did not want to assume that was our order. After all this the order was canceled. Worst manager and employees.</Text>< Pictures>

Came here to pick up a to go order. When I came I waited outside with my dad. The people in front look like they dont know know what there doing. Because they forgot to give us the topping for one of our orders. It was the dressing for the cinnamon rolls.<//Review>

<Text>I wish there was a 0 star to give. Very disgusting and horrible management. They humiliated my friend and disrespected him for not seeing the sign on the door. Someone needs to shut this business down and save the dignity of others. This place has already a very bad feedback. Unfortunately, majority of customers dont check reviews but THE CORPORATE can do something, hurry and take steps to save your hard earned name.</Text>< pics>

<text>Terrible service!! I called the store in Alhambra, Ca. about 4:45 to order a pizza and was put on hold. After over 10 minutes on hold, I hung up and called again. Again, I was put on hold and kept waiting. I guess they forgot me and don’t want my business. That’s okay. I DON’T want or need Dominos!!!< /text><Rate>1<//Rate><pics>None</pics>< response>

They had me wait 2 hours for a delivery, then they sent a reject driver who can’t read addresses. I never received my food. Lost out on my free pizza I had accumulated! Never again! Service is garbage here! So is management!< /text>

Guys, this pizza place in Alhambra is my favorite! We have had a few mishaps but nothing they haven’t fixed, In fact they have gone above and beyond. Definitely 100% recommended this establishment.
Thank you guys for everything! 💖</Text>

Update 8/18/20: I frequent this Dominos location and always have a great experience. The food is good and the service is good. Tonight I ordered online and drove to the store to pick up my usual order. The woman at the store seemed to be working alone. She was not wearing a mask. She didn't wear a mask while preparing, handling or packaging food, while answering the phone, or when a guest entered the building. In my opinion, she should have been wearing a mask even if she was working alone.

Previous review:
I ordered an alfredo pasta bowl with diced tomatoes and they DIDN'T assume I meant that I wanted chicken. I can't count the number of times I've ordered vegetarian alfredo from Dominos and found chicken in my dish.<//Review>

LOVE this place. Regardless of what's happening around town , playoffs, holidays you name it, These people are on the ball. From ordering ( which I do on line) to door step delivery the process is seamless, smooth and easy not to mention quick. I wish every other business i had to deal with were this top notch !!< /text>

I just feel it's such a shame that the employees at this location have Miriam as their store manager. A store manager should set the example of great customer service to their team members and that is something this girl failed to do. She is very rude on the phone and in person, definately not a way to treat a customer that has purchased Dominos for more than 2 decades. I definately encourage other customers to take a little  time to call corporate if you get this type of service. I now have to drive to a farther location to just not come across this person with such negative vibe.< /review>

I called on a very busy night and I expected it to be a long wait. It has been over an hour and it still hasn't shown that the pizza was even out of the "Prep" phase. I called this Dominos and right away, "It's on the way." So I was like, this is great! I guess the online tracker isn't accurate. 45 minutes go by and I am wondering why my pizza hasn't been delivered yet since it's only 1.5 miles away. Turns out, it has even been made yet. Once I called again, I finally see the pizza tracker move into the "Baking" phase. I wish they were just honest with me, I could have just cancelled and got something else. Instead I was just waiting there, and it took over two hours to get my ONE pizza. I called again and the person says, "If you want to cancel, I can cancel for you." I mean, at this point, it's been two hours, if I cancel now, then it would just have been two hours wasted. Nonetheless, quite disappointed that they just said whatever they could to keep my order. Could have just been honest, because I understood it was busy. I would have still come back to order again. Not anymore though. It was a good run guys.</Review><username>Michael H.</username>< UserId.>

Absolute disgrace. Almost 2 hours to get ONE medium pizza & wings. Called to check on the order only to be placed on hold twice by 2 different people and then hung up on. This place is only a 2 min drive away from me yet took almost half an hour to be delivered. Don't order from here, THEY SUCK! Customer service is a joke.< /review>

<review>I go here quite often and every time I come I get great service from the man who always helps me. Tonight when I called to place my normal order Guadalupe answered the phone and she was very RUDE. she tryed to charge me more then what I pay then would put me on hold without even knowing while she took other peoples orders! Then a young got on the phone and said hello and when I said hello back he put the phone down. I think that's disrespectful to cut off your customer and attend to other things while they are still talking.<//review>< Pictures>

Question for Those who have ordered On Line and Paid with Credit Card on the website.
I know its common for them to check ID / Credit when they deliver the orderz but have any of you had one of the Delivery people copy down you Complete Credit Card # on the stores receipt. I asked the guy last time and he said it's policy.. I got the receipt and ripped off the part where he copied my CC#..
No one should have a physical copy of your CC.. maybe write down the last 4#s to make sure it matches but theres no reason they should copy your whole cc#.. am.I crazy?.or do places like Dominos have a right to do that?</Text>

HORRIBLE. First time I ordered from this Dominoes, the pizza showed up late and COLD. This time, they put the toppings all over the pizza instead of only on one side, as I had ordered. FAIL.< /Text>

Terrible. I live less than a half a mile away and the delivery driver didn't even make it to my front door. I called the shop and the girl who answered was rude and not helpful at all. I am contacting corporate on this store.<//text>

<Review>The workers here are very kind and friendly. They are always going around making sure the place is cleaned. I know because we always make a mess! SORRY GUYS!
The gentleman managing the property was great helping out when we needed to move from our upstairs unit to a bigger and closer one at the bottom. We got exactly what we wanted!
Thank you so much were very happy here!</Review><rating>5< /rating><date>1621613408350< /date></record></dataset><record>

Definitely the best storage in the area. It looks a little older but the service is totally better than the other storage's in the area. I've had storage's at a couple other places before coming here and I can say that the manager was lot more knowledgeable, friendly and went above and beyond in helping me. The storage was clean and the property was well kept. I was satisfied in my decision.<//text>

The property here is well maintained and secure. The storage units are clean and Neil, the manager, is personable and provides excellent customer service.

Update: I posted last year when I moved in and since I moved out a couple months ago, I wanted to jump on here and say that Neil was great. He was accommodating to my situation and made the the move out process easy.<//Review>

Came into this location to rent a storage unit with my family and the young lady Yolanda helped us. When I say her customer service was AMAZING ! I mean it, she was so polite & made sure my family and I understood everything. The property is so clean & I love the fact that there is a gate code to get in and get out. I will rent again due to the customer service that Yolanda provided !</text>

Prior to leaving the state of California for a couple of years, we called around and looked at several storage facilities before stopping into the Rancho Cucamonga StorQuest location. The facility (inside and out) was clean, well-kept, and secure. Each interaction we had with anyone at StorQuest was always professional. The staff was very understanding of our needs and Manager Neil Chatarpaul was always available to answer any questions we had. Thank you for being a safe and secure location for us to leave our property without a concern!< /Review>

<review>The staff at this StorQuest location is absolutely outstanding and helpful.  From the moment we arrived last December looking to rent a unit,  Neil was thorough and patient, and clearly wanted our experience to be an outstanding one. And on moving day, the large van rolled right up to our unit and the process was seamless. Over the months, we were able to get rid of some things and then wanted a smaller unit. Once again, Neil gave us a tour of our options and helped us reserve a smaller unit. On unit moving day, Evan/Ethan (I apologize for not remembering...) was on the ball and also facilitated an easy transition. With all that's going on in the world, it is the little things that help life move on as smoothly as possible. I appreciate both of these gentlemen.<//review></record>

This place is located behind some businesses and in front of a neighborhood, kinda hidden but it is a gem! It is an older property but the staff keeps it clean as with the storage units. Their rate are low to competitive with the other companies in the are. Service is above all else!<//Text>

I had a big unit here and it was clean when I first rented it and service was great throughout. Neil was always ready to assist and address any concerns. He kept the building clean and well maintained.< /review>

I have been renting a unit for the last year, and have recently renewed my lease. The building is very secure, and very clean for a storage center. I'm confident our belongings are safe and will remain as we left it no matter how long we go between visits.

More importantly, Neil has been very supportive, and works with us to ensure we get the service we need. He puts our needs first, even if it means extra work for him. I really appreciate his sense of work ethic and willingness to help us.< /Text>

Service was great here. The manager Neil was pretty cool and personable. He gave me multiple options and explained my best one that benefitted me the most. Not too many people take time to help us really decide whats best for ourselves now a days so this was exceptional for me and the deciding factor on getting the unit.</review>

I came here after visiting a few places with my sister and we had the best customer service compared to the other places. Neil knew what he was talking about. He is friendly, kind and professional. I love how StorQuest have taken precautions to Covid-19. We felt safe and clean. Neil went over everything and it was all touch less! Thanks Neil and StorQuest! I highly recommend.</review>

First storage experience and I am very pleased! Neil is very helpful, informative and so are the rest of the staff! Reasonable prices! Kept clean and in great condition, it may look like an older building (because it is) but they do an outstanding job keeping up with the place! Would recommend to anyone needing storage for there things!</Review>

Service was excellent and the storage was clean. Pricing is always good here. This is my second time around and Neil helped me both times. He has always been kind and professional. This time I needed storage due to this whole covid-19 situation we are in. Neil understood my situation, showed compassion, and was accommodating! I appreciate it so much!< /Review>

Seemed a little under staffed, but it was completely made up for with quick and easy processing. Plus Neil was very friendly and I would've been completely lost without him, literally. He even came out to help me move my stuff after watching how difficult of a time I was having. Not to mention, I went to the wrong door and wouldn't have been able to find my storage unit without him. Thank you so much Neil! The area and units were clean as well.</text>

I stored here for over five years plus and it was a great experience! Neil was always accommodating and friendly. When I first rented, his suggestion worked for me and he explained everything. It's great to see that he is still with StorQuest and the amazing job that he has done. My family is thankful for his compassion and assistance over the years. Thanks Neil!</Review>

This was the best storage option for me. The prices were competitive but the service was way better than the other 2 storage palces that I went to. The property is clean and you can tell the people working here cares about it. I recommend storing here. I stored here twice, both being great experiences.<//review>

I was storing at Public Storage down the street but they kept raising the rent and the customer service was bad. So I decided to try StorQuest. I gotta say the customer service is 100x better, friendlier people working here. The process was fast and easy as well. The manager Neil was knowledgeable and gave me a great deal.<//Text>

So far so good. I came here because its incredibly close to my house. The storage units are pretty secure and the customer service is great. Made the entire process quite easy. I would definitely recommend this self storage to others. But a quick note....buy your lock somewhere else...if you forget they offer locks for $15.< /text>

I stored here for a few months and did not have any issues. Neil was kind but also straight forward and helpful. I guess you can't really find too many people now a days that are professional but also friendly and kind.</Text>

Neil is a cool dude; service was great and he was helpful. Pretty funny guy too. This was my 3rd time using storage and it was by far the easiest. Service was so good that Neil got my girl to do a review too haha. I recommend this place.</Text>

<review>I'm happy with the overall experience. The only downside is that it's about impossible to talk to anybody at the actual storage site. The 800 number isn't the site, and when I reserved a space, the price I was "guaranteed" was not the price I paid, because the person who reserved it didn't make the correct notes. This was not the fault of the actual facility, and I still got the unit for a fair price. I have used StorQuest before, and I would still recommend them, but I would visit the actual facility instead of trusting the 800 number or information on the website, just to be safe. Nothing beats face-to-face dealings.< /review>< Pics>

Public storage had a slightly lower rate for the storage I wanted but Neil made me a good deal I couldn't refuse, plus his service was better.

Been storing here for almost 13 years. I moved out of state and have not been back but I know my stuff has been safe as I've been in contact with Neil over the past 3 years. Neil/StorQuest has been very accommodating and have provided me with great service since I've moved. I'll be back one day to get my stuff. Until then, I know it's in good hands. Thanks guys!<//review>

Katrina and Neil are totally awesome!!  Words cannot describe how much they helped me and my family.  They have the best customer service ever.  When I had to find a storage facility to store my personal belongings, I never thought I would find a facility that completely catered to my needs.  Katrina made it possible for me to move in and Neil made it possible for me to be closer to the elevator.  How can I thank such wonderful individuals.  If you are looking for a great storage facility and great staff, you must come to StorQuest Self Storage in Rancho Cucamonga and meet these two individuals.  They will make you feel  totally welcome.  I am so happy I found them.  Thank you StorQuest for hiring such personable individuals.  It is hard to find good customer service, but you did a great job in hiring these two individuals.  Keep up the great work.< /review>

Neil was so accommodating and friendly that I had to rent here! I shopped around and found a couple places just a bit cheaper but Neil's friendliness and knowledge was much better than the other people that I saw before him. Anyways I reccommend storing here!<//Review>

Katrina and Neil are totally awesome!!  Words cannot describe how much they helped me and my family.  They have the best customer service ever.  When I had to find a storage facility to store my personal belongings, I never thought I would find a facility that completely catered to my needs.  Katrina made it possible for me to move in and Neil made it possible for me to be closer to the elevator.  How can I thank such wonderful individuals.  If you are looking for a great storage facility and great staff, you must come to StorQuest Self Storage in Rancho Cucamonga and meet these two individuals.  They will make you feel  totally welcome.  I am so happy I found them.  Thank you StorQuest for hiring such personable individuals.  It is hard to find good customer service, but you did a great job in hiring these two individuals.  Keep up the great work.</review>

<review>I rented at other storage companies for my moving company before but this one is better than those. The customer service is great, and the manager is friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable about everything related to storage. I've had 3 units here and I'm satisfied with each of them. The manager is professional, straight forward, and keeps it real. Tells you everything you need to know upfront. Thanks StorQuest and Neil!</review>< Pics>

<Text>Prices are a great and the customer service by Neil and Katrina is fantastic. I personally was helped by Neil and I have to say that I like the way he was professional and friendly. The thing that separates him from the other people I spoke to at a couple other storage's, is that he keeps it real. He explained everything including pricing, whether or not he could beat his competitors that I mentioned to him, and what StorQuest can offer better than the others. There was another storage place about $8 cheaper but I decided to go with StorQuest because Neil was personable, kept it real, and assured me that my stuff would be safe. He didn't just try to sell me a storage or promise me anything, he told me like it is and I respect that. Thanks Neil and StorQuest.<//Text>< Pictures>

Put my stuff in here once, signed up for autopay, and never had to worry about any issues. Having autopay helped me because I don't have to always worry about when the payment is due. Thanks to Neil for letting me know about that option and being professional!< /Review>

Came across StorQuest after visiting a few other storages in the area and was immediately greeted by Neil, the manager, after I knocked on the door. Obiviously, because of Covid-19, there has been precautions that have been made by everyone and Neil did no different. I appreciated the safety measures he had in place and the positive mindset he had with me. He took time to explain everything and show me a few storage options while reccommending one specifically to me. His knowledge and demeanor was great throughout and was enough to get me to rent here. Thanks Neil and StorQuest.<//text>

So there are these two nice people at StorQuest named Lisa and Neil
Truly nice people and down to earth people
They're located behind the AutoZone on foothill Boulevard and Archibald
You know it's just a storage place like any other storage place but it's the people that make the difference and it's nice to go somewhere just to put your things away and it could be a hassle sometimes to be moving back-and-forth like most people do or to have to do but you know when you go somewhere and you run into nice people it just makes your day better and I appreciate Lisa and Neil for just being nice to us!
So if you are moving or you need to store some stuff these guys will help you out, give you good information and give you a good price and most importantly be nice to you!!!!!< /text>

<Review>I had a terrific customer experience here. I would suggest to anyone looking for a place to store some of your belongings, here would be the best place for that. They are very professional and courteous, the facility is very well maintained and taken care of. Neil really knows how to take care of his customers wants and needs. He really took the time to explain everything to me so there was no confusion on my part and every question I asked was answered with confidence and assurance. Neil gets 5 stars just for his services alone. Thanks to him, StorQuest will continue to have my business. Amazing customer service is hard to come by.< /Review>< Name>

We have downsized a couple times already and each time Neil, the manager, was accommodating  and patient. He was knowledgeable and always recommended the correct size for us.  Big thank you to Neil and StorQuest!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Date>

<review>Before renting my unit I visited 5 facilities to see the properties, check pricing and meeting the staff.
I found both Neil and Katrina to be very professional and also very nice. The property is clean and I feel secure storing my personal property there.
I would strongly recommend StorQuest to anyone for their storage needs.

The unit was super clean when we moved in and we moved in same day which speaks volumes to some of the other storage yards in the area. The whole property overall is clean and quiet. Neil does a great job with any questions / concerns we have. Very hands on management.< /review>

<Review>I have been a customer since 2009 renting (4) units. The attention and professionalism is outstanding. Neil and his team are  amazing. They are always available to help,  answer questions and willing to go the extra mile.

Note: regarding my earlier review and rating,l did not figure out how to rate (5) stars ,which this business deserves until after it was submitted. It was then I saw I had mistakenly given a rating of 3 instead a 5. So I corrected my error. Neil and team rates a well deserved 5.

< Review>
After "storage shopping" for a while, I came across this location when looking for places with good ratings on yelp. I must say they were right about the great customer service and quality of the facility overall. The manager was very helpful and patient with me as i asked a lot of questions. He ran some numbers for me and was considerate of my desired price/space. We were able to find a great space for my junk. I also like that it is located in a quiet area and that it's really clean. Aside from price, cleanliness was also a crucial factor in making my decision. Recommend for sure!</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>This is a great storage facility , rent a unit there and needed aabigger unit so Neil helped me out in getting a bigger unit and it was not even far from my old one so it made it a whole lot easier to move everything over. They have excellent customer service. Great prices too. Neil is a great manager he is always more than accommodating, and knowledgeable. The whole staff is always very friendly and helpful. I will recommend to all of my family and friends. Thank you StorQuest!!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I came here 2 years ago and have no intentions of leaving. Wanna know why ? Theres humans on the other side of the phone , the Customer Service provided goes beyond 5 stars, they make you feel welcome , listen to yours needs , work with you to find the best solution. The facility is good to point out , is squeaky clean and secure . I highly recomend Neil and his team at this location!

We had to down size our storage at the last minute.  StorQuest was extremely helpful and accommodating with our situation.  I  had to help my 77 year old mother down size her original Storage with SQ. The representative ( hate I forget his name) made sure we only had to walk a couple feet away from the original Storage and was understanding with our dysfunction.  We got a great deal and easy transition!<//review>

<review>The practically 5 star rating speaks for itself here. StorQuest was very enjoyable to work with. The staff were always super friendly, explained everything very thoroughly, and were always easy to get a hold of.

I picked them in September of 2017 because they were the cheapest in the area at the time and i used their facilities for about 1.5 years.

The facility seems very safe and clean. I never felt like my unit was in danger of theft or vandalism nor did i ever see evidence of rodents or other pests. This was a concern of mine as i was out of state the whole time i had that unit.

All in all i would recommend them!< /review>< pics>

Neil was professional, and still friendly.
The office was neat and clean.
He had me out of there fast. As fast as he was he did not forget a thing.
I look forward to working with him in the furture.<//Review>

Neil was professional, and still friendly.
The office was neat and clean.
He had me out of there fast. As fast as he was he did not forget a thing.
I look forward to working with him in the furture.< /text>

Neil and the StorQuest Self Storage facility are amazing. We couldn't have been more pleased with the overall experience while we had our stage unit. The real difference maker for us was how helpful and kind Neil was in helping us with out unit. Good people!<//text>

Awesome service. Neil the manager was extremely helpful , courteous, friendly and professional. He took the time to listen and helped me pick the right unit.  He made a very stressful situation tolerable. I can't thank him enough. He really went above and beyond to help me. Thank you Neil!
I would definitely recommend Hampshire StoreQuest to friends.</text>

<Text>This storage location is hidden but it's very much a gem! Neil at the front desk is super helpful and knowledgable, and while the spaces are very retro (like 60's old), it's a very secure and safe spot for your belongings. Would recommend, plus they have online bill pay and account management for your storage space if you ask to be set up with the service- free of charge!</Text><name>Anonymous Anon< /name><userid>117374591771954628487<//userid><Response>{'time': 1529352013355, 'text': "Bahareh, we're glad you had such a wonderful experience with us!

<review>I was referred to this facility by my son-in-law. He told me that the manager was really cool. When I called to inquire on a Thursday evening, I left my information with a young lady. Neil, the manager, called me back within 30 minutes to further meet my needs. He arranged my reservation and I went the next day, Friday to sign paperwork. It was such an easy experience. I appreciate the friendliness, courtesy, and the quick accommodations. I'm in now, and feel extremely satisfied that my personal belongings are in good hands! Thank you Neil!

I've cleared out one unit since then and am in the process of clearing out my final unit. I can't express enough the courtesy that this place provides. Neil is exceptionally helpful and is basically, an honest man. I feel that he is in it for the good of his clients. He listened to my needs and made sure to give me the best possible rates. I appreciate the time he dedicated to making me a happy customer. Thank you, once again, Neil! The staff is also very knowledgeable and helpful.

<review>This is my second time renting a storage room and the employees were professional and personable. Neil (manager) was so helpful  and understanding, there was a time I came late and his shift was over but I needed to get a fishing pole for my dad and my number didn't work to open the door so he used his code to let me in and help me look for my fishing pole even though he was supposed to go home. Neil saved my 4th of july weekend! Lol I truly appreciated that and it showed what a kind and hard-working person he was. Alexis was extremely kind and helpful not to mention fine as hell. She had a great personality and went out of her way to show me more rooms and was very patient when I was undecided on choosing which one room I wanted. The rooms seemed well secured and fortified so I know my belongings will be safe. I would recommend storequest to a BMnyone.<//review>< Pictures>

I had a great welcoming by Christiane. She really made me feel like i've been storing there for awhile. Price wise is great also!

The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff is what really gave me value at this storage facility.  Whether I forgot the code, forgot a payment, or whatever, the staff was always friendly and helpful, and I never felt unsafe when I needed something from my unit.<//Text>

We just moved in Rancho Cucamonga and was looking for a storage to put our extra staff. The price is competitive but the storage place is descent. One thing that I appreciate most is the great and respectful customer service they give to their clients. Thanks to Neil and Edwin for making me feel welcome to Rancho Cucamonga.< /Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Chris B<//user_name><Text>Hallways covered in moldy carpet, one elevator for entire second story, rat droppings and urine covered my property stored there for a year. Very humid and musty environment, I do not believe it is climate controlled. Unit price also gradually increases over time.

I don't know where these other reviews are from. Anyone saying how clean it is must have had a first floor unit that opens to the street and didn't actually go inside the storage building. Oh and their stuff will probably still be covered in rat pee and poop so remember reviews at checkin are only half the story. And who cares how friendly the staff is when you will likely only ever talk to them one time.< /Text></record>

<text>Neil was great and willing to work with us. We had another unit booked but once got there we noticed the unit was too small so he upgraded us to a bigger one. He also gave us a move in deal even though it wasnt even supposed to be offered on that unit just to keep our business. I would highly recommend this place. We were definately taken care of.< /text>< Pictures>

Some of the best costumer service I've ever received. I love a place where the costumer always comes first. I've been looking for somewhere to store all my stuff since my wife just kicked me out of the house. I showed up after hours of looking at other storage units and as soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile which made my day since all the other places seemed rude and not willing to help. I told the mann exactly what I needed  and my price range and he was more then happy and willing to help me please my needs. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to store their things .. place is great clean and in a really nice environment. Thank you very much to the manager they mr deonauth not sure if I spelled it correct but that mann helped me when no one else would.< /review>

The on site staff at Storequest is always very helpful with all my questions, whether it be billing or gate access times, they are always there to help.  I've had storage with other companies and have never received the type of quality customer service I receive at Storequest, Rancho Cucamonga.  The facility is always very clean and very well maintained.  Best storage experience to date!!!<//Text>

<review>My experience here has been positive. I've had a unit for a little over a year now and haven't had any problems.
