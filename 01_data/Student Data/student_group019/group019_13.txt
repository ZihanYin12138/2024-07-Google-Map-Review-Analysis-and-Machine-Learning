Adrian is the best representative at this location!  I highly recommend you request him when you arrive. He is very informative, friendly, and most importantly professional. I walked out with a insurance policy & car registration for the next year. I couldn't be any happier that I was in great hands. Thank you Adrian!</text>

<text>Was very satisfied about being helped by Michelle's professional skills on how to process & understand clients.
But due so other employees I dont give 5starts all though I do to her alone I'd be very happy doing business with Michelle again in the future 🙂 *****.

I spoke with a representative by the name of Kelly Vazquez. She was beyond helpful and assisted me through the process of setting up my insurance policy. She is very knowledgeable and patient. I recommend speaking with Ms.Vazquez when going in the facility!!
Very satisfied with the service. Thanks again Kelly!< /text>

Good customer service my only problem is being lied to, I went to unsuspend my plates and was told that it would take a bit to remove the suspension but I said that fine paid the fee and waited to remove it. 3 hours later the guy tells me oh yeah the suspension is removed unfortunately the dmv is closed and we can’t get you your tags but you can come tomorrow and we can do them for you. Luckily I know someone else who knows how to check if my suspension was removed and was told no your suspension was never removed and idk why they told you it was removed. I’m not upset that it’s not removed, I’m upset because I’m lied too straight to my face and I lost of day of work just to get this done and all he could say was come tomorrow.< /text>

I go in once a month to make my payment & Raul Palma is usually the one that helps me out. I like to ask A LOT of questions so I know where every penny of mine goes & Raul does a good job of explaining & showing the fine print so I can make sure I'm not overpaying.< /Review>

<Review>To be honest I know some agents who use to work here were very bad for customer service and the new agents that Adriana's Insurance are better qualified and more attentive to the customers needs. I've gotten my insurance thru Freeway and AIS and both companies don't really care about you after they sell you the insurance, but the agents at the Colton office are very nice and extremely helpful. I will be referring my family and friends to get insurance thru Adriana's insurance.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>They are the most dishonest company! Watch out, they told me the insurance company requires 365.00 down, paid it! Turns out the required amount is 135.00, the rest of the remaining amount went to the broker, after lying to my face saying his feet was 99.00.

<Text>I went to the Ace hardware store that shares this address.  Ace like always packed with multiple options to get your project done. They have a bit of everything.  This store has more tools than others, which was cool. The paint department has a few things to make it easy and cleaner when you paint. I try finding this place before with no luck but now I know its right up front through the black gate. With that bit of info you can also find it now.</Text>< Pictures>

<user_id>102644451949516450573< /user_id><review>I ordered an online item for in-store pick-up, but decided to cancel it because I found better deal elsewhere. Going in store and asked to have said item canceled, only to meet with a staffer who slammed the said item left and right, repeatedly saying "you're here already, might as well pick it up, since you paid for it." After a very awkward silence, he brought me a printout showing the item, and asked me once again if I was sure about the cancellation, and I responded yes, and he walked away continually slammed the item left and right. I was wondering if I needed to sign something indicating my cancellation, and another staff standing next to him just coldly replied "that's it" without even an eye contact. I have been to many ACE before, but I will never visit this store anymore.</review><Rate>1<//Rate><pics>None<//pics>< Date>

<text>they have everything you can think of that you need. Lots of different size nails and screws and paint and the people there are really friendly, but it's a little on the pricey side oh, I know it's because it's nearby and you don't have to run all the way to Home Depot, or Lowe's whichever one. But other than that I mean they have everything in Hardware that you need.< /text>< pics>

Horrible customer service! I sent over a take off sheet for a material bid and was dealing with Ivan Escobar.  When sending the take off over he asked me to let him know who else we were getting quotes from so he could make sure to be competitive.  I provided him the names of the other lumber companies in my email.  Every other company I reached out to had my bid to me within 1-2 days.  Today was exactly one week and when i called Mr. Escobar advised that he has been busy and would at least get me the lumber bid today but the hardware he wasn't sure how long that would take.  I was a little upset with this and asked him why he had not even touched my bid request, he said well other stuff has been coming in and he was very busy.  I then advised him that apparently my business isn't important to squires lumber (now mind you this was around $13-15 thousand dollars of material I'm buying) he said no it is and I can work on it now, I said unless you can assure me that you can beat grove or champion lumber pricing to not even bother at this point.  His response was priceless- Oh we cant beat their prices.  I said then why did you not just inform me of that when i had originally told you who i was getting bids from?  I will never do business there again.  I had bought lumber from them once before for a large patio cover (and the lumber was pretty beat up).<//Review>

Is also Ace Hardware in the front
which I go to. It's the only hardware store that's in the area so Iam glad they are there & have pretty much anything that you need for around the house jobs/repairs!
The only thing that sucks is not being open on the weekends or Sunday one of them, that's always the day I need something to show up to a closed store!<//text>

<Text>This place is a small place compared to other Ace I have been to.i seems it needs a diversity of employees.i walked in for my first visit there and the person standing closer to the entrance just starred at me.no one offered to help me to find what I was looking for.the best Ace I've been to so far is the la puente area one.they have the best customer service ever.this location can use something called customer service.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Always very helpful to when I go in there. Staff will lead you to the item instead of pointing and shouting a number.<//Text>

<user_name>Tammy Lawson<//user_name>< review>
I am a local to Squires. Last week I was in the midst of repairing my fence to secure my dogs on my property.
I ran out of screws to secure the panels, so I thought I would drive to my local hardware store and purchase some.
I jumped in the truck, drove about an 1/8th of a mile, picked out the screws I needed.
When I approached the counter, I pulled out my debit card, the gentleman rang it up, then asked me for I'D. I asked him if he was serious, he said yes.
Well, this being a quick trip, I did not bring my purse, thinking no big deal.
Ok, here's where I have a problem...
If I had a debit card that didn't belong to me, I wouldn't just buy a $7.00 box of screws!
Since he was serious, I told him that's cool, I will go buy them at Home Depot!
Dear Squires Lumber, I will not ever be back to support my local hardware store. I will make it a point to let all of my community members know what happened, which by the way, I am a volunteer in the community, and I bought the screws for $3.00 cheaper, needed no I'D, and fixed my fence.< /review>

Kenny is always there and will remember you after a few visits. Just like a small town hardware store things are not cheap but the friendly service and quick distance to hone make up for it. Wish they were open on Saturday.< /review>

After using the crepe correcting formula for a number of years, I am constantly asked what I use on my skin. My massage therapist said that my skin was in better shape than hers! She is in her 40’s and I am 74 😊!
I definitely saw an improvement in the texture and tautness right away. I use it on my face,  Neck, and arms.
Think I would BATHE in it if I could. The texture is light and not at all greasy. Keep up the good work! I also love the results from the Dermal Repair Complex. Has significantly reduced the deep wrinkles around my mouth.

Stem Cell Moisturizer makes my skin look smooth, glowing and healthy.  I am mistaken all the time for someone in their 30's even with my mask on.  I love how my skin feels after applying it on my face.  I love this moisturizer and won't ever live without it.  It's better than all the gold in the world!<//review>

<time>1614706285009<//time><review>I have been using the Crepe reducer for a few weeks now and it has helped so much. I use it on my face, neck, arms, legs and hands. A coworker said that I was looking great and younger and that my skin is now glowing. I brought in one of my jars that I hadn't opened and she has used it for a couple days and says that she also loves it. I wouldn't be surprised if she contacts Beverly Hills MD to start ordering her own stash. Love the product. I can really tell the difference. My hands don't look like they belong to a ninety year old woman when I'm only 64. Great product!</review>< resp>

I’ve been using several of Beverly Hill’s MD products at the same time so it’s hard to tell which one is helping with what particular issue but I’m enjoying the Deep Regenerating Stem Cell Moisturizer. It’s lightweight and has definitely helped moisturize and soothe my winter worn skin. I give it 4 stars for now because I’d like to see how my skin feels after another few weeks of using this product.< /text>

Within a weeks time my skin became hydrated soft and supple.  I use this cream every morning after I apply some of my other wonderful products from BHMD!!
Thanks for all of your great products!!< /review>< pics>

<Review>I use this moisturizer first thing in the morning with the newer product, Lift and Firm Booster, followed by Lift and Firm Sculpting Cream and finally, Deep Wrinkle Filler where needed.  My skin feels smooth, hydrated and ready to go for the day.  I should have mentioned that I start out with Smooth Radiance Exfoliating Scrub.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I absolutely LOVE the Stem Cell Moisturizer......have been using it for years and will never stop.  Even when I wash my face at night to remove makeup, I can still feel the silky moisturizer on my face.   It's just wonderful!!!!< /Review>

The stem cell moisturizer is perfect for drier skin especially in the harsher winter months.  It is also beneficial for mature skin.  I will use this cream regularly.  Because of the consistency of the cream, a little goes a long way.  It is definitely my go-to cream.<//Review>

<text>A couple of weeks into using the Crepe Correcting Body Complex, I wasn't expecting it to work.  I'd not seen improvement. I was discouraged at that point.  Then after more time of consistent use - I noticed an improvement and my skin continued to looked and felt better.  I've also noticed that my skin maintains its smooth, tight texture longer.  At first the morning application wouldn't last.  Now it last longer so my skin must be more hydrated and the Crepe Correcting Body Complex is working.  I'm thrilled.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I’ve only been using it maybe two weeks.  It does make my creepy skin on my neck and chest look a little better.  Time will tell me if it just makes it look better temporarily or actually makes a permanent difference.<//Review>

Wonderful products, I can't thank you enough.  I am going to be 52 this month and this is me with only 2 laser treatments (not heavy or, done by the Doctor.  I have NEVER had any fillers or, Botox EVER.  I would love to send you a pick and see what you think.  It will be of my face only and I am using one of your hair products and actually bought the Lift + Firm Sculpting Cream and love both SO much.  I cannot thank you enough.  Also, in the pics, I have makeup usually only on my eyes and lips (those are natural and have had no facial work done ever.  Please let me know and THANK YOU! :)

Have a wonderful day tomorrow.  Thank you again, Pamela Annis :)<//text>

I have used quality skin care and Shaklee (quality) vitamins for 50 years  so it is amazing  that I saw the improvements that I  did.  I quit smoking after 40 years and lost 30 pounds of fat 4 years ago.  I have more wrinkles than I should because of this. I will continue to take DERMAL REPAIR COMPLEX due to results I have experienced.  I also love the hints you give us and have benefited from trying them all.  I tried CREPE  CORRECTING BODY COMPLEX and saw immediate improvement in my skin. Thank you so much for having fragrance free products. Thank you, Stephanie Raymond.< /text>

<Review>I gave a 3 star because I haven’t had a chance to tell the difference yet. Only got to take them for a couple of weeks, before I had fallen ill,  thinking it must be coming from the vitamins, needless to say it didn’t, started back taken them yesterday. Will to get back with you on this. Still excited to see the difference.</Review>< date>

Thankfully I found Beverly Hills MD though the Dermal Repair infomercial. I now use 14 different products and that’s because they are all incredible and have had such a positive impact on my skin. I wouldn’t buy this much from a company that has bad customer service. Everyone I have spoken with have always been helpful. Their return policy is awesome, encouraging you to try new things. And I love being on their list with the detailed information on the products from the doctors - I have learned a lot! My only complaint is that I wish one could contact an expert in the products when the customer service agent hasn’t had direct experience with the product to answer detailed questions. But that hasn’t deterred me from making them my go to skin care company. And btw - the brow and lash serum do work.

<Text>I have read several one-star reviews before I posted this and noticed they were mostly complaints about the purchase experience and bad customer service, which of course warrants the one star.  However, my one star review is about the product itself--the eye brow serum I purchased.  It simply does not work.  I bought it after watching video reviews of people saying they noticed thicker brows after six weeks.  This made me buy two 30 day supply bottles so that I would have enough product to give it a real chance of working.  I used it as directed-two times a day for two months and absolutely nothing changed.  My eyebrows look exactly the same as before I used this product.  I also read the responses to one-star reviews from "Samantha" (which someone stated 3 months ago in a one-star review that there is no Samantha that works for this company, which doesn't surprise me at all) and can read that each of her responses say a slight variation of the same thing: (1) sorry; (2) results may vary; and (3) we have many satisfied customers.  This is typical of a company that sells any anti-aging products, as their only obligation is to sell a product that doesn't HURT anyone.  The unfortunate reality is these products actually don't have to work!  Hence the convenient, disingenuous, cut-and-paste responses by a fictitious employee.  I'm guessing this serum either contains what it says, or is something else completely, but whatever it is, it is easy to come by and costs nothing to make, then falsely advertised by who I'm guessing are either friends of the company or people they paid to say how great it works.  I lost money on this product, and, of course, I will never buy anything from them again.  I posted this review to save others the time and money that I cannot get back.  Save yourself the trouble and use the money for anything else, because I don't believe the above three company review responses whatsoever and neither should you, as they have every reason to lie.<//Text></record>

I love how it diminishes my stretchmarks and it tightens my neck wrinkles.
It has helped as I have been working out at the gym with the loose skin to tighten it and bring it in a little more and feel a little more firm.< /Text>

I am a 70+ vain women. I have found Beverly Hills MD crepe erase cream the best ever for my neck and chest. Noticed a major difference after 2 weeks. I even have started spreading it onto my cheeks as I rub it in. Any left over goes on my body where needed.< /Text>

<Text>I find that it works best for the 8 hours following the application and after that the crepe skin comes back. I particularly need it on my arms and hands a and for that first 8 hours there are hardly any lines or bumpy ridges on my skin. Maybe I am not putting enough on but I am trying to make it last. I don't  know if I will be able to afford another jar. I also take your pills daily and so does my husband and they have done wonders for my face. The red veins in my face have calmed down considerably and my skin has a better tone and less lines.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2bc081c58f001:0xbac9c9dfd37c799c</gmapID></record>

<Review>I am 74 yrs old , my daughter is 53 yrs, most of the time , people think we are sisters.
When traveling international, we were in line at the airport , my daughter said " Mother, come with me!" to go thru customs. The officer replied "That is not your mother!" We showed
our passports.They were astonished.
The point I am making is ,  I was mistaken for a much younger woman. I have always taken care of my skin, but in the last year, I have developed  crapey skin ,on my neck and arms.
I ordered my first Dermal Repair Complex
Jan.o1,2021 , as well as the Crepe Correcting
Body Complex Creme.
It is amazing, the results , I have experienced !
I will be a devoted woman of these products,
for a lifetime... .
We are going to Italy ,
as soon as possible, when this Pandemic, allows us.
HOPEFULLY,  WE GET SAME RESPONSE !!

Crepe correcting body complex is lovely hydrating gel, soaks into skin and I am sure it has made a difference to my aging skin.  More plumped.  Unfortunately with Covid shipping to NZ takes forever so I have had to find something more local to maintain what was achieved by Crepe correcting complex<//Text>

I Think it was 60 days before I noticed my skin looking better. I am happy with the overall results on my face, but wish I had help for the cysts that form. Cysts have become worse since I've aged. The Crepe Erase lotion fills marvelous and I really notice a difference

I came across a video of Dr Layke talking up Beverly Hills MD Anti Ageing Dermal Repair Complex. I domt normally watch some long winded promos...but my resolution this year was to look after myself.
There are sellers of the product in Australia but I thought it would be safest going straight to the source.
I ordered two bottles...that was Jan 28th....its now March 3rd.
I was assured by customer service ( after writing a trust Pilot review) that is was on the way.
They are now ignoring emails. I would not have thought such a world renowned company would be scammers... Dr Layke you're a fake.< /text>

<Review>I took 1 pill a day for 3 days and it gave me a skin reaction on my face, my skin feels thicker and bumpy. I called the office and they refunded the money but that is the least important matter. I wanted them to tell me how to get rid of this skin reaction and their answer was “you need to go to the doctor” what??? I was not expecting that answer, they should have a plan when client have side effects. Very disappointed at them.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2bc081c58f001:0xbac9c9dfd37c799c< /gmapID></record>

I have used this With Body shops Vitamin E hydrating serum and found a lot less crepe-like skin on my arms, at 58 this has increased regardless of lifting and pulling patients. The pills really did not make a difference. I really plan to use it elsewhere on my body in addition to squats and doing Codes on patients.<//text>

< Review>
I use the Creep Correcting Body Complex on my body except my face. My back below my shoulder blades and sides of my ribs firmed up. The skin on my upper under arm also firmed up. I am outdoors a lot (tennis and horse back riding) so my hands are exposed to the sun. The cream made my hands look younger and minimized the brown spots. I also see an improvement in my nails, they seem stronger and more glossy. The product lives up to its name.</Review>

I have been using it for four months now and beginning to see improvements on my arms, which were in bad shape. I encourage anyone using this product to stay with the daily application. You will see changes and it is worth it.</Text>

The Regenerating Stem Cell Moisturizer is the best day or night treatment you do not want to live without. I recommend for all my spa guests. I personally use it and my skin is super smooth and extremely hydrated.  ~julesbeautysf< /text>

<Review>I am very happy and excited about your fantastic wrinkle filler. I have used all brands (major and not so major ) Too this day you are by far the #1 product, ‘ Winkle filler’ . I’m 69 years of age , raised in Hawaii, lots of sun ! You have shown me that I am able to have beautiful skin  & look a great deal younger without surgery.

Thank you!<//Review><user_id>118308747746881892526< /user_id>< pics>

You guys charge me three times $51.99 I have emailed and emailed. For one bottle that Was canceled on 7/9/2020. I canceled when I notice the charges which was the same day of my order. Scam I'll pass I see you guys don't like to do refunds. It should be as easy as when you took my funds return them just as fast.</review>

The dermal complex meds had my husband and I both nausea and I threw up on day 3. The facial cream for anti-aging, lightened both of our skin color. Then they state that if your not happy with the product or results that there is 100% money back guarantee, but when I tried to return they stated that if all bottles empty or full are missing then you loose out on the money back, which luckily I kept everything, but no where does it state you must have all items in order to complete return, then they tell you in order to return you have to pay for shipping. From CA to go back was $15. I would not recommend this to anyone, the product or company.< /text>

Dear Dr’s. Layke and Danielpour,

I have been using various brands of moisturizers for years. When I happened to come across your “Deep Regenerating Stem Cell Moisturizer”, it was like nothing I had ever used on my face/skin before! I absolutely LOVE it! It only takes a small application and it glides on effortlessly and soaks in, leaving my face so soft. It’s not greasy, just laying on top of the skin, failing to soak in, as some other brands I’ve tried. I never want to be without “Deep Regenerating Stem Cell Moisturizer” and that would be my choice, should I win your drawing.

I also have the utmost respect for both of you Dr. Layke and Dr. Danielpour! Your products are everything you say they are! In my opinion, your products are the best on earth!

Very Sincerely,
Debra Turner<//Text>

I was a long time user of this product. Their online sales people and business profile has become extremely sleazy. I was talked into buying a years worth and instead of getting charged monthly the product came all at one time. A couple months later they mistakenly sent me another years worth and charged me for another years worth of the product. When i called to tell them about their mistake they charged me to ship their product back. That is bad customer service. There are better products with better customer service.</text>

IMO, DERMAL REPAIR COMPLEX is just a fancy name for an over priced MULTIVITAMIN but, when a nice, clean cut looking chap in white coat markets it under the label Beverly HIlls MD, you're supposed to believe it's some miracle capsule that will keep you looking and feeling young and taut.
It's not.  This is price gauging at it's finest.  I'm sure the good doctor has enjoyed many niceties at the expense of his clients' naivete.
Nice try.<//text>

Very disappointed without even trying the product! Ordered 1 bottle of the complex and while bypassing all the add on products purchase 3 bottles .. 6 bottles.. add this on..etc ( which indicates a cheap product) I opened my instagram and found an offer for the same product I ordered but cheaper even though I used the 20% coupon “limited time offer”. I finished up the order and sent an email to customer service with my confirmation email and a copy of the add! I got an automatic reply that they’ll get back to me. Funny enough 36 hours later I get an email telling me my order shipped and a few minutes later an email from customer service that they can’t make any price adjustment for orders that shipped already!!! Really?!? And that I can use the offer to order more products!!  I feel cheated! You’re supposed to give your client the best price tempt them to use it. I’m waiting for the shipment to come in so I can return it!
I would not recommend for anyone to feel cheated the way I feel!!
Thumbs down for such service!
Btw I’m a health care professional and was going to try the product and maybe recommend it for my patients!

To follow up, they responded by saying I’ll get a full  refund as u see in the response. That refund did bot happen, when I emailed back to follow up no response!!! So even the reply for the bad reviews are fake!!!< /review>

My purchases went smoothly.
I had a return and Alma did a good job of notifying me regarding the credits.
Thanks Alma,

<review>I am 55 years old and am often told that I look like I’m 45, I’m thankful for good genes!

But the crows feet by my eyes were becoming more noticeable to me.

I was skeptical about the BH filler because I had tried other products that produced no results.

BHMD filler is different, it feels good going on and has made a significant difference in the crows feet.

The only regret I have is not taking the offer to buy three at once!

I’m thankful for this gem that I’ve found!<//review>< UserId.>

I have been a client/customer for years.  Love the BHMD products.  I am especially thrilled with my latest purchase the Ultra Renew Hand Rejuvenating Serum.  My hands looked bad.  As women we constantly have our hands in water, changing diapers, dishes, house work, yard work, COVID-19, etc. You get what I am saying.  I used this product ONE time and woke up the next morning and my hands were beautiful.  I don't know what's in this stuff but I am impressed to say the least.< /Text>

I ordered 3 bottles of the dermal repair complex. At checkout, they offered me a discount for 6 so I chose that option. I could not see my total until after i checked out and they had charged me for 9 bottles. I have since went through the return process which has been very frustrating. I had to wait on hold for an hour before finally getting in touch with someone.  I sent product back a month ago and still have not received my refund. If i dont see my refund this week, i will be reporting to the Better Business Bureau.<//Text>

The Beverly Hills Stem Cell Moisturizer is a MUST in my life. I have always had very dry, sometimes painful skin. This moisturizer is the best I have ever used in my 71 years!! My skin is soft and not the least bit dry or tight. I use it twice a day and have it shipped to me regularly. I even got my daughter using it now. I love it.<//Text>

Before using this moisturizer, my skin would feel dry and I would  scratch at my skin.  Not so after using this product.  It's also light feeling, non-greasy, and absorbs quickly.

<Text>I have been using Beverly Hills Deep Wrinkle Filler for a little over a month now and I have tried many, many products for the fine lines around my mouth and I’ve used expensive brands and cheaper products and by far this has worked better than any other product I have used! My friends have asked me what am I doing to look so young and I tell them I owe it all to BHMD!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!

<Review>I’ve had a lot of problems with bruising on my hands and arms to due to years of Cortizone shots. Previously I had bought a cover-up because I looked like I had a disease with all the wine colored blotches that took weeks to disappear. I think I’m on my third bottle of dermal repair and shockingly my hands are clear! I just bought four more bottles of it because it’s really a miracle for me. I’m going to try the cream cream because perhaps it will work as well. Here’s hoping.</Review>< pics>

I am 78 years old and take blood thinners for a heart condition. I purchased this product to thicken the skin on  the back of my hands in hopes it would reduce the ease at which they bruise after minor impacts. I also wanted to reduce the visual aspects of the bruising when it does occur by increasing the thickness on the skin covering the broken blood vessels. After one month of daily use the product has improved the texture of the skin and my hands look much younger.</text>

They don't tell you that you have to cover the shipping cost if you return the items. I think if I had known this, I would not have taken a chance on their products. The supplement product caused my hair to shed severely. The facial cremes irritated my skin, so I am really disappointed that I had to spend $14.00 on shipping their products back to them to receive my refund.<//Review>

The Crepe Correcting Cream really hydrates my skin and my crepey skin doesn't jump out at me. While we were moving, I couldn't find the box that had the cream in it for about a week and I could really tell the difference. I also tried in the meantime to use another product and I just wasn't happy with the results.</Text>

Everything I've tried so far is magic. Fully recommend this product line!!! Do they have stock?? I don't have much $$ but this company is blowing up. Real results. Tried various products. Nothing compares to the results.</Text>

I love the stem cell moisturizer. It just feels so good to put that on I know it’s doing something. I am 77 so it’s really important that what I put on my face enhances.  I don’t have too many years left do you know. This plus the activated retinol night treatment and the rejuv-gh (these two I rotate every other night) these 3 are my favorites of your products with the dermal repair complex capsules.</text>

<review>I'm 76 years old so I didn't expect anything to happen, but I neck is a whole lot tighter. The rest of my body was tight because I exercise a lot, but my neck was beginning to sag, and now it looks really good.

I ordered Beverly Hills, MD's Dermal Repair Complex for $39.95, but when the shipment arrived they had sent me their Cover and Correct Foundation instead.  I contacted them about the mistake and was given a return authorization number to ship the product back to them.  I paid the shipping to return it, and received a $26.00 credit for returning the product that was shipped to me in ERROR!   Buyer beware!!!< /Review>

<review>I’ve tried 3 products from the company. So far, did not work at all. One it’s supposed to lift and firm. But I didn’t work either. Honestly I keep buying it because I used to have very dry skin. And the product keeps me moisture. I also called customer service and I spoke with a supervisor SO RUDE. His name it’s Andy P. Supposedly. The reason of my call it’s because I keep receiving a sticker on my jars with a promo code that doesn’t work for over 2 years. Grand another representative mentioned that it’s from an old batch and creams are good for 2 years. Cream does not have expiration date o date of produced. Looking for a new cream at store to avoid all of them.< /review>< Pictures>

Beware!! A day after placing an order and paying, I received an email from customer service saying they would refund me (this was not requested by me), however they failed to refund the full amount! So I did not receive anything and yet had to pay for I don’t know what! I contacted customer service twice and got no response! It seems like a big scam to me, I recommend you stay away from this unprofessional fraudulent group!<//review>

I placed an online order for one bottle of vitamins through an instagram ad. I saw a day later that I’d been charged twice. I had to make three phone calls before I was directed to the right place to report the double charge.

The girl on the phone was rude. Told me it was my fault I’d clicked twice. (I didn’t). My fault I placed the order on mobile not a computer, because their site isn’t mobile friendly. (Even tho I responded to an Instagram ad, which is a mobile-only experience.) She said they make it clear that orders should be placed on a website not on mobile (it wasn’t clear).

She told me I’d need to pay for shipping in both directions to return the bottle I didn’t order.

This seems like a known issue—double orders—and they’re just content to make it the customers problem.

She said, “you only ordered a 30 day supply but these vitamins require 90 days to see results.” As if I should be grateful they charged me for vitamins I didn’t order. After all that, she asked me if I’d like to be part of their text club to receive promotions. Read the room, sister girl.

This whole operation feels gross. The elegant solution, when you know there’s an issue with double orders, is to check in with your customer when you see two orders for the exact same thing on one invoice. Not push it through and then make it my fault.<//text>

Worst company ever to deal with! Received product which was expired OVER 2 YEARS! They would not exchange it. I even had to pay for shipping back to receive a refund.

Finally something that works! The flaky dryness is no more. This product seems to go deep into the tissues and lasts all day unlike other creams I've used on my arms and legs. And I'm 70 years old with a fair amount of sun damage. It goes pretty fast using it daily but I'm happy with this product. Worth the money.< /text>

If I could give 0 stars I would. Their products do not work and despite 60-day money back guarantee, they do not take products back. After emailing their customer service twice (which they received), I called and spoke with Tempest. She asked me 10 minutes of irrelevant questions, just to be difficult, and then put me on hold for 5 minutes (probably thinking I'd hang up). She came back and promised to send an email explaining how to return the product. Her email never came. They have deceptive advertising, unethical practices and incompetent personnel. Stay away!!<//text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>I am in my 70s, nobody can tell.  I use about 6 BHMD products religiously and another 2 intermittently.  They are great!  I buy these products when they are on sale and I swear by this product line.  My only disappointment has been with the Dark Spot Corrector.  Maybe at my age, my spots are stubborn.  The serums, creams & supplements all work.  Everytime I try a different brand, I wind up giving it away.<//Text><user_name>Rhonni Malino<//user_name><userid>116707246083674192044<//userid>< rate>

<text>I love the many products I use however, their online customer service is non existent! Several times I have tried to contact customer service online about various questions and I never get a response. Considering how the company sends out so many informative emails and I belong to the text club, this is very disappointing considering I live on the east coast and they are on the west! Obviously sales is more important than service!</text>< user_id>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Finally there is someone out there who was able to help my skin look and feel healthy again. At the ripe old age of 65, my skin has been through sun baked burns, and the wrinkles on my hands showed it. After trying many products that did nothing but grease my skin, I saw Beverly Hills MD advertised on my phone. In desperation, I tried the Crepe Correcting body complex, and Holy Mackerel, a miracle happened! My wrinkled hands are beginning to feel soft, and they don’t burn anymore  when I wash my hands! I cried with joy! I stocked up, and never want to be without it! Your Crepe Correcting body complex is a medical marvel! Thank you so Much!< /review>< pics>

I have seen a great improvement in the softness of my skin. I have crepey skin on my arms and some cellulite. I’ve seen improvement as far as the crepey skin-just need to find a solution for the cellulite. But I will say the product has really improved the look of my skin so that the cellulite isn’t as noticeable.<//text>

The website automatically double charged me.  I was told they couldn't refund because it already shipped, but I had literally ordered via the web site within the three previous minutes .  How can they think it is acceptable to double bill customers on web purchases and not refund the charges immediately. they are aware of the problem because there is a notation of duplicates chargers occurring if the back button on the browser is used. Well then have a developer fix the problem.  I think it is broken on purpose. I foresee a lawsuit.< /Text>

Of all the products I've tried over 40 years BHMD delivers. Very importantly, if you don't have a satisfactory experience with any product their customer service is the very best across the board for any consumer, client  or patient based group. What I truly love is they stay connected with their clients by constantly reaching out with great DIY advise in the meantime. What's more impressive is they offer specials over time on all products so those of us on limited funds still have the opportunity to use a high grade product. I'm so glad I discovered BHMD .<//text>

I have only been using  the Crepe Correcting Body Complex for about 3 weeks. It worked almost immediately on the inside of my elbows and decollete . Other areas seem more stubborn so I am continuing dailyntreatment and will see what happens in 30 to 60 days.<//review>

I cannot believe this!  I am 70, young for that decade, but the signs of ugly aging in my arms has been an embarrassing and confidence destroying phenomenon. I didn't have the best results with BHMD face creme, but I was absolutely blown away by this Crepe Reducing creme for those utterly shocking wrinkles, sagging, baggy, crepy drapes of skin on my arms and legs.  I have not used this creme one month.  Yesterday at the gym with my arms above my head, (which drops the skin down mercilessly), my  hands gripping the bench press bar, I saw the staggering difference in my forearm dragging skin.  It was pumped up, firmer by 60% and looking at least 10 years younger than the skin I looked at just a few weeks before. The skin on my upper arm where it meets the shoulder is also substantially improved. I'm looking younger because of my arms.  My legs are firmer as well and the skin seems to be getting tighter.

This formula rocks!  I think Dr. Layke and Associates are honestly on to something effective and truly uplifting on physical and psychological levels. Can't do photos just yet but will submit them.

I am duly impressed and grateful.

I called to let them know I moved and the customer service rep was beyond demeaning and I was told I was being transferred to a supervisor and just let on hold for a half hour.  They are too busy and don't need customers I guess.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Really disappointed with the customer service. I have emailed over 5 times, no response. I spent over $900 and I am not worth a reply? Really bloody annoying.< /Review>

I was driving through on vacation and got a flat tire. Even though it was late in the day, and the guys wanted to get home they still too the time to fix the flat for me. I am ever so grateful for their kindness!< /Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>I came in to buy walking tennis shoes.  I was waited upon immediately.  What I wanted from the rack was not available.  The young lady went into the and brought out several pairs of shoes. I didn't like them. BUT! I waited patiently while the rep attempted to wait on two other difficult to serve customers.  It was worth my wait. She came back to me with a couple of shoes.  I liked them both and left with a smile. The young lady was patient and maintained her composure all with a smile. Good job young lady!👏<//Text>< pictures>

Good costumer service, I do tend to shop often. Wish that men’s clothing options would extend into better collection.</Review>

Well it only took four tries but on the fourth try I was able to leave with a bench grinder. They did give me a small discount for all of my trouble but it was quite a journey. The place looks like a ghost town inside with very few customers and as I was leaving someone in tires was yelling at a customer. Everyone in the tools department was quite helpful as was the manager with offering me a discount for my troubles.<//text>

<Text>Even with all the Corporate problems Sears has the personnel here continue to show up, be positive, responsive and helpful.  What this location offers has been pared back, but for the core: appliances, tools, outdoor needs, automotive, bedding, work and children's clothing there are plenty of options and sales.< /Text>< pictures>

DO NOT purchase an appliance from here.  It's been a week since my purchase, and still no delivery/install.  I've gotten the complete runaround from SEARS, and would cancel this in an instant if it wasn't a replacement item from another item that was on warranty from SEARS.  Apparently they have no one to install their dishwashers.  If that's the case, they shouldn't be selling them or selling them with a huge caveat that it will take a few weeks to get the product installed.</text>

<Text>Glad this Sears remains open! A lot of people shop here, even though there is  Walmart in the area. Sears here has a lot of great deals on EVERYTHING in their store.  Pre-ordered delivery to your vehicle. Shop here online & in-store before you go elsewhere.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

It was okay since they didn't have many things to try and catch a buyers eyes. They also don't have many sizes in stock so that kinda ruined the time I took to visit there.< /Review>

The store looked awful, customers always beg for assistance, waited and waited for long until customer give up. An yet, still no one to assist you. I think only two cashier's scheduled to work for weekdays. Very bad customer service.😞</Review>

I purchase a Patio Set because the floor model in the store was very nice! Now once I got my Patio Set home and is was not a small set this is big sofa with to chairs so I had to get help, but once I unpacked the set and it was in my deck I saw the two chairs where damaged! So I got help taking the two chairs back to the store and ask if they could give me the chairs in the floor model since they was out of stock in the store because I the chairs that come both was damaged! And store manager said no I would need to bring all the set back and they would need to order a new set! Now I explain that I needed the set for this weekend us I was going to be having a celebration so if I had to order a new set there was no way I would get it on time! He still didn't care, now I already had the two damaged chairs with me the store and he was going to make me go back home and get the big sofa to bring back to the store!!! So I had no to have my friend go to my house for the sofa as the chairs and sofa would not all fit in a track as this is a large set so I had to stay in the store just waiting! But then there was no way I was going to reorder a new set from Sears after all I had to go through I was so upset this the customer service from the store!!!</Text>

This is the worst store ever! No wonder the company is shutting down.  It's sad
The whole shopping mall needed to be torn down or remodeling it. I thought I was going to get robbed walking in!</Review>

<Review>The tech that came out for my cleaning was very professional. He made it a point to inspect the carpet thoroughly and explain the services they offer clearly and help me pick what services were best for my space. Their costs were fair in respects to the job they did. He worked very efficiently and explained different parts of the process to me when he was doing them so I understood what he was doing. I had multiple spots of pet messes from an incontinent older dog and housebreaking a pup and they did a great job of removing them. I would definitely use them again and recommend them to friends & family.<//Review>< pics>

I’ve used ChemDry for many years and would never consider using anyone else. With multiple cats in the family, our carpet is always a challenge but Rob and Joe are so nice and very thorough and efficient. The carpet looks amazing when they leave.<//text>

<review>This is an amazing company that handled business properly. They are very nice, professional, courteous and they know what they are doing. We've used them many times and they are our first call. This last time they were booked up for a couple weeks and we needed the carpet cleaned to get the house on the market. We were going to have to wait but because the house was waiting to go to market on the carpet cleaning they kept us in mind when they had a cancellation and got is in 5 days early! The house went to market the next day because of this. We are so grateful and thankful to Chem-Dry for taking such good care of us! Top notch service and top notch people!< /review>< Response>

AV Chem-Dry for the win! Not only did they come out and sanitize my 2,400 sq. ft home with just a moments notice but they offered me a military (Veteran) discount and holiday rate. They are professional, on-time, and they did a great job, highly recommend!< /Text>

I have 3 indoor dogs 🐶 so I have my one huge family room cleaned every 7 months.  I decided to try Chem Dry. I am so happy I did.  The service is superb. I love, love how they cleaned my carpet. Chem Dry is who I will be calling every 7 months. Great 👍🏻 job.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Lisa understood my ASAP status, and scheduled me for the next possible appointment.  Two days later she called me with a cancellation and my carpets were cleaned that day.

My carpet is 12 years old. I have 2 pets and my female is stubborn to say the least. My carpet is sparkling. I can’t believe it for the age of the carpet

I have went to west side Chem Dry from the beginning. Try a cheap outfit once about 5 yrs ago. Never again. Worth every penny and they are reasonable.
Happy Customer 12 years. First review!

Same thing a new yr. 13 yrs now!! Carpet still sparkles< /review>

I will only use AV Chemdry on all my properties. They are punctual and do a fantastic job getting spot out. My whole house smells great after a cleaning. Have my carpets clean and sanitized. My carpets take a real beating during the year from running a business and entertaining. Would not use any other company<//Text>

The team was very professional. Before starting the job they wanted to know the cause of the fabric stain to ensure satisfaction once the job was complete and whether they could in fact guarantee removal of the stain. In fact they asked if they could do a test first and if it worked they would proceed with cleaning. Once the test was run we agreed to proceed. After the cleaning was done, from what we could tell the stain was gone. And since the fabric was dampened they even promised to come back if, once it dried, the stain returned. This is excellent service!</Review>

Very happy with the carpet cleaning I received several months ago.  It stayed nice for some months, as opposed to other carpet cleaning services I have received in the past. With kids and animals, it is always a struggle to keep things nice for any length of time, but their cleaning method really does the trick, and I felt the house was truly "sanitized" .  I will be contacting them again in the near future.  I only hope I get the same technician (he was awesome!!) I just can't recall his name, so I hope they keep good records.  A little pricier than perhaps other services, but well worth it.  Highly recommend!!!<//text>
<resp>{'time': 1574881709934, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your feed back. We take pride in our deeper, longer lasting clean. Using the power of carbonation bubbles allows us to really get down into the base of the carpet lifting that stubborn dirt and grime that is other wise hard to remove. We also do not use detergents or phosphates which means no dirt-attracting sticky residues! We very much look forward to seeing you again in the future and it will be our pleasure to honor your tech request.  Thanks again for choosing AV Chem-Dry!'}< /resp>< date>

Chem Dry guys showed up when they said they would and were friendly and easy to deal with.  I had a 30+ year old oriental rug that had some damage. It looks marvelous now, better than I expected. They also to out a nasty spot on my living room carpet. I was very pleased and would use them again.<//Review>

OMG! I love that the dirt and stains came out of my carpet and did not return!  My carpet is old, but cannot replace yet.  I am very pleased with this company.  I will be having them here 2 to 3 times a year.  I am recommending them to all my friends</review>

<text>Chem- dry helped me out with some VERY bad cat urine damage to carpet.  Working with them was a breeze they are nice, helpful and understanding. They came in and did the first treatment and the smell was so much better, although not completely removed.  When I called to discuss this they didn't waste any time setting up another appointment to get someone out to me again.  The second time helped even more, although I have a nose like a hound and I can still pick up on the smell at times.  I believe in the product if you're working with minor to mediocre stains/smells.  For the real troubled areas (like mine) the product will make them 10 times better but not...perfect.</text>< time>

Horribly rude, unhelpful, dishonest staff sent me on a unnecessary wild goose chase driving all over town to another store that was just as rude and unhelpful. Don't get your phone plan with Verizon as I foolishly did. Boycot this company.</text>

Had a great store visit with Edwin and James. Told them the issue with my phone. Did a thorough check on my phone and was repaired in about 15 minutes. I was out the door in 20. Very satisfied customer will definitely be returning to the store location.<//Text>

<Text>Updating my review as I was recently back in the store and had an amazing experience with the staff here I’ve been to this location over the years and the consistency of the customer service and my experience grows every time the other stores in the area are just not up to par with these guys anyways I’ve referred friends and family who have all thanked me and given their praises for the recommendation if not for the last couple experiences with this store I probably would have switched from Verizon to another carrier as they’re very competitive but so glad I stayed got my bill lowered again more than last time and still got too keep my unlimited data 5 stars all the way!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<text>I came here to upgrade and get a new case/screen protector and Maria made the entire experience a breeze! I got my phone, a really cool case, and a tempered glass protector! She gave me a lot of good information on the phone and the process. I’m very happy we chose this store over the other ones nearby. It’s definitely worth your time!< /text><Rate>5</Rate><time>1526677033165</time><name>Diana Schotanus<//name><UserId.>105990249289133156559</UserId.>< resp>

I had stopped in as a means to pass the time   while I waited for family to complete their shopping in a nearby store , which i had expressed  the fact to the sales associate who had shadowed my every moment from the time I walked in . Previously being a Verizon customer  , now with T Mobile, my phone had the Verizon app. with my prior Verizon  account information , which the associate was able to view said information , that had automatically uploaded  to his hand held device where the Verizon  associate ,out of sheer desperation from lack of sales , was able to open a wireless  account in my name unbeknownst  to me. To this day it is on my credit file impacting negatively. I made several attempts  to clear this up to no avail  my only option is to file a police report and only then will Verizon take steps to clear this matter up. I am positive that some of you know who this jerk off is if you too had a poor encounter  at this location .< /Review>

Absolutely rude and condescending staff. The store was entirely empty during the day when I brought my mother in for assistance. We have been Verizon customers for 15-something years and I had never been treated so poorly. We needed to transfer a number and possibly upgrade but none of the boys behind the counter wanted to help and simply handed me a phone number to call an automated service. I wanted to upgrade a phone and no one cared to make any sort of sales pitch on this... needless to say I took my mother and left to find much better service and a friendly staff at the nearby Verizon Victra store.<//text>

< review>
FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD. GO TO ANOTHER STORE!!!! Do not buy from AV, JEREMY, OR SYD. This store encourages reps to make customers think they are getting something that they will ACTUALLY pay for (add-ons, contracts, etc).  Even the managers are in on it and encourage this behavior. A manager from another location helped me discover that they nulled a jetpack contract that I was tricked into so that it would not show up or be traceable in their system. He even told me they were being "slimy" and did not condone their behavior.  When I had initially confronted the managers, they were even more disrespectful than the rep and told me I was lying I stead of FIXING it.  I was appalled. I have NEVER been treated this way by managers. Do yourself a favor and buy at another location.  There is a major difference between upselling and flat out "stealing".</review>

Sydney at the Northridge, CA location was absolutely wonderful.  He spent a lot of time with me setting up a gmail account so I could free up storage in my phone.  I thought I was going to have to buy a new phone. He was so knowledgeable & patient.  This is the Verizon I always go to.  I always receive great customer service.  Sydney is a great asset to Verizon.  Thank you Sydney!<//text>

This review is in regards to a particular employee at this store. She is a heavyset woman with glasses and long brown hair. Possibly mid 20's to early 30's. She could be either Caucasian or Latina. I would avoid dealing with this woman if possible. She deleted an app off my phone without my permission claiming that it was a clean sweeper app(it's not) and that it eats a lot of battery(it doesn't). I went to the store to ask a question about using the smart switch app, As I had gotten a replacement for a phone that was giving me problems. She asked what's wrong with it, when I told her she literally took the phone out of my hand and deleted the app.  I informed she shouldn't delete apps without asking the customer's permission first. She said "well I put it back for you ma'am" even though she called me ma'am she said it in such a condescending tone, that she made it obvious she thought she was talking to an idiot. A salesperson should never speak down to someone or talk to them in a way that their  tone of voice shows they think the customer is an idiot. She also took the protective film off the new phone which is something I never asked her to do. This person is not a technician. She's a sales person. She has no technical knowledge about phones. She doesn't even understand what certain apps do yet she'll delete them without your permission. If this sales woman approaches you, whatever you do, do not give her your phone to look at. If you do you'll risk having apps deleted and being spoken to in a condescending tone. The manager of this store needs to school her on how to treat customers.< /text>

<Text>I have never written a review before, this is my first! This is hands down the WORST experience I have EVER had! Don't ever go into this Verizon store. They will screw you completely over!! I went in to buy a new iPhone! And they lied to me about my trade in value, charged me twice for two covers, and two glass protectors. Charged me an activation fee on a device that was supposed to be free. Overall, I woke to a bill of $313 which took me all day to work out and a trip into the Verizon store. Where I was met with non-friendly faces. And the guy that told me my phone trade in was $200 says "oh well I said my manager would look into it" Really!?? Worst part is, I'm supposed to be happy about my new iPhone. But I'm not!<//Text><rating>1</rating><user_name>Jennifer Rosenblatt</user_name>< response>

-9  John Carlos set me up with a new phone.  He even signed the contract for me and signed me up for the protection plan that I did not want.  Of coarse he denied signing anything when I had a manager around.  The manager, Lamont, was less than helpful.  When asked about John signing my contract, his response was "it is your word against his" and he was not concerned about the fact I was signed up for the protection plan when I was clear with John that I didn't want it.  While John is a shyster, Lamont is worthless and uncaring as a manager.  I may post more after dealing with the regional manager and Verizon.  These 2 should be fired!!!</Review>

ALLAN IS AMAZING. He offered great service and was honest about the devices, plan costs, and total charges.
However, VJ IS HORRIBLE. He looks like the "typical salesman. " Slicked back greasy hair and a phoney smile. He lied about the prices and current promotions. Be alert if you get him. Try to switch salespeople to someone else.<//review>

Spent almost 6 hours walking back and forth between Verizon and Apple, for Verizon to exchange a defective iPhone purchased at Verizon! They were semi nice to our face and talking about you behind our backs thinking we couldn't hear them.
They were NOT helpful people.
Poor customer service.
Not willing to exchange a phone that we're within our legal 14 day return/exchange policy that they themselves state on their receipts.
If I could give no stars that would be a better representation to there actions and attitudes.

I will never buy a phone from Verizon again.< /text>

I thought about writing about my 1 hour horrible experience at this Verizon but just thinking of it stresses me out. All i have to say is the Manager was very rude and made me feel uncomfortable.I should not have to feel like that at any store i enter! He needs a lot of training on his customer service and if i could remember his name(something like Quais) i would put him on blast! Any ways VERIZON TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES ON CUSTOMER SERVICE ESPECIALLY THE MANAGERS! Seriously considering cancelling my Verizon account after my experience yesterday.< /Text>

In order for me to have the dead simple request of purchasing two phone accessories and get a receipt, it required no less than 5 separate calls and three face-to-face visits. I never even got the receipt because I'm on a corporate account (even though I paid for the items with my own card). Horrible service. All they care about is making commission. No desire to help the customer.<//Review>

On May 01, 2014, I went into the Northridge Verizon store location 14287 to possible get a new phone with my family. The representative JD informed my husband and I that we can combine our accounts, get 2 brand new phones, 2 tablets and accessories for a total of $200.00 and my monthly bill will be less than $200.00 a month which is what we were currently paying. He brought out two baskets of accessories that we did not pick and charged my credit card and debit card. My husband and I confirmed with him and his manager that we would not be charged again or charged in any other way. Since we were there a couple of hours and they were closing, they were only able to finish one phone. I returned the next day to finish my husbands phone and get my in laws the same deal which took several hours as well. A couple days later, my phone started acting up. Fortunately, they were able to declare my phone a lemon and exchange it for a new one, which they took a couple hours and deleted important information that I informed them before they worked on the phone that I needed to be saved. JD informed me that it would not get deleted which it did. This information deleted cost my business tremendously! Since then, I received several bills all more than double what I usually pay. I went into the store several times and spoke to the manager who told me to return when the associate was there which is odd to me since he is the manager, he should have been able to help me. Every time I have gone to the store, I have waited hours. I also called customer service several times to get assistance and have been on the phone for several hours each time getting no resolution.
As a direct result of this transaction, We have paid over thousands of dollars to Verizon. I have proof of text messages from the associate and I, receipts and a witness to all of this. Today August 7, 2014, I called customer service again and was on the line for a total of an hour and forty minutes which I received no resolution. We have been Verizon Customers for over 20 years! This has been the worst service I have ever received. The associate lied and misinformed us. In addition, as a direct result of this, I was told by the manager at the store to pay my normal bill and remaining balance would get credited, which my phone actually was disconnected several times by them which is affecting my business. I am receiving calls from Verizon almost every day saying my bill is past due and will get disconnected.
In a recent phone conversation, you claimed that why would Verizon give free accessories. You also claimed that, even if I was misinformed, I should have brought the accessories back, which I went to the store and they said I was charged in error. Now three months later they are claiming the Verizon store is stating that they did not say any of those things.
As to these issues, we would not have changed our plans, combined them or changed our in laws as well. If we would have known that we would been charged these amounts we would not have done this. We do not use most of the accessories they gave us, we do not even need them.
I will take this matter as far as I need to in order to receive a resolution. I will contact the media, blog and even legal matters.
Please contact me immediately! I would like to file a grievance against the Northridge store, the associate and the manager that helped me. I should of realized that there were 2 people at the time also complaining when I purchased the phones to know that this store must be ripping people off at this location.
Sincerely,
Vanessa Jimenez</Text>

My wife went to this Verizon store a couple of months ago to buy a basic Phone for her Mom which she did, No problem there.
But while she was there one of the sales associate name Cesar sold her a Wifi hot spot which we have NO NEED for it. He told her that she only pays $25 sales tax Device is free and there is no monthly charges, When we found out there is a $20 monthly charge right away she went back to return it, But they insisted there is no monthly charges, we called Verizon they said yes, there is a $20 monthly charge for the Wifi hot spot.
So for the fourth time I also went there with her we explain the whole thing to the Manager name Raul He was very rude and unprofessional, he charged us $175 early termination fee to cancel something that we never ask for it we didn't need it, and it was pushed to us by false information and lies.
So we were charged $25 sales tax $40 two months service fee and $175 early termination fee. So it costed us a Total $240 and lots of frustration.....
I will never go back there again.<//text>

< Review>
The employees at this store are not honest they lie to you about the return policy, they charge stocking fees $35 but they tell you differently when you purchase the phone that you have 14 days to return with no stocking fees. This is the worst store ever.<//Review>

Cant get to a person on the phone, store employees are useless and there is no help to be had. I think Verizon is a terrible company with the worst employees and worst customer service, Sad really.<//text>

<text>One of the worst Verizon stores in this planet, I have been there twice and both times the people had mega attitudes.  They don't know the meaning of customer service, if me staying with Verizon was based on that store, I would have been gone a long long long time ago.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<text>Yesterday I dropped in to Rush In Documentation Center, which is a clever adaptation to Russian as there are representatives there that speak Russian and can serve the local Russian community. I asked for one simple thing, was greeted and treated amazing, which I thought disappeared completely after march 2020.  Svetlana helped me, she is warm and helpful despite my asking for one very small and probably not very lucrative item of their service.  In the meantime other people came in to take passport photo's etc, and she was amazing.  Easy parking next to Whole Foods on Santa Monica and Fairfax.  Check them out.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2becf6e4b1c0d:0xf2be5054d02c3bc8</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I am a regular client in Russian Documentation Center. All workers in the office create positive and professional atmosphere. It is always pleasure to work with them because they are organized, informed and creative about solving different issues. Nargiza helped me a lot to write several complicated statements to the Russian court using the special language and terminology. She responds for any additional question right away by e-mail or by phone. I would definitely recommend to work with this professional team.</review>

I have dealt with RDC on oh so many occasions throughout all these years.....wonderful people...true professionals who go far and beyond of what is simply expected of them...the degree of care definitely exceeding the "you get what you paid for" principle.

Forever grateful for taking care of my business with so much precision and professionalism.

The RDC took good care of me since I was overwhelmed and stressed out by the process and dealing with my problems . There is not a better law firm out there that really cares about their clients and will help to make a difference . Thank you again for everything . If I ever need your services in the future I will definitely contact you.<//review>< user_name>

I walk into this place in tears after other "Translation Services " place made a lot of mistakes in transition of the very important documents that had to be in Moscow in 3 days. I knew that I'm running out of time.  Vadim and Nargiza assured me that I have nothing to worry about: they will do the transition within one day and also offered a currier service to deliver my documents on time! EVERYTHING was done as they promised:))

(Translated by Google) I needed to get a Green Card. I really don't like messing around with papers and we turned to Rush in DC for help in getting a green card. They told us everything in detail, answered all the questions, helped to collect all the necessary documents, helped prepare for the interview, and even provided me with an interpreter for the interview. We had full support, that is, no nerves - they took all the worries about our business upon themselves. As a result, I received the green in 3 months !!! All in all, I highly recommend these guys! 😊 Especially if you, like me, do not like all this paper fuss and value your time 😊

Мне нужно было оформить Грин карту. Я очень не люблю возьню с бумагами и мы обратились за помощью в оформлении Грин карты в Rush in DC. Нам все подробно рассказали, ответили на все вопросы, помогли собрать все необходимые документы, помогли подготовиться к интервью и даже предоставили мне переводчика для прохождения интервью. У нас было полное сопровождение, то есть никаких нервов - все заботы о нашем деле они взяли на себя. В итоге, гринку я получила за 3 месяца!!! В общем, я очень рекомендую этих ребят! 😊 Особенно, если вы так же как и я, не любите всю эту бумажную суету и цените свое время 😊< /review>

Incredible professionalism - it is immediately evident that a person is engaged in this type of activity all his life. What is most important and interesting is that the agency really (unlike others) does not aspire to "draw" money from the client, but first of all it helps and very competently adjusts and advises both in terms of documents and in terms of emotional (attitude). Once again many thanks for the vital advice and help! ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻

Огромная благодарность Вадиму за консультацию по получению визы! Невероятный профессионализм - сразу видно что человек всю жизнь занимается данным видом деятельности. Что самое важное и интересное это то что агенство действительно (в отличие от других)  не стремится «вытянуть» деньги из клиента, а первым делом помогает и очень грамотно настраивает и советуют как в плане документов, так и в плане эмоциональном (настрой). Ещё раз огромное спасибо за жизненно важный совет и помощь! ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻</Review>< Pictures>

Food always comes out super hot.. that the food cover bends shape.
You get to pick your options on what goes in it.

< Review>
My PS4 Pro started bugging out. Very slow and the graphics looks like polygons. I looked up PS4 repair and Bros Game Shop came up. I arrived around 530pm and met with Austin. He checked out my PS4 hard drive and showed me the digital reading was "critical" in other words burned out. I left my PS4 pro and Austin called me st 730pm, its ready. Wow!!! Amazing my PS4 is working again!  Like perfect!  Loved this service. Recommend 100%< /Review>

Sally is AWESOME !!
She quoted me a GREAT price (over the phone) for a new PS3 controller. When I arrived she was just as nice and genuine as she was on the  phone. There is an ample selection of new and used games for various systems. I'll be a lifetime customer !!<//text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>Customer service 101: when a customer is buying three games and comes up to the register, you don’t say “Just this?”. “Just” implies I’m not buying enough for you, or inadequate in my purchase. You should say as a professional “ Did you find everything you needed? Anything else I can help you with? Or even “All set?”
Also, if some calls looking for something that’s coming out soon, take their name and number or name and email to follow up with them when you have do have it to make the sale. Don’t just say “No” and hang up the phone.
Simple stuff like this separates mediocre stores from good stores. Game bros have proven themselves to be mediocre repeatedly.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Asked if they could help me test my N64 and a few games. The person said that they don't "waste their time" with these kind of repairs. Said they couldn't help me unless I "made a purchase".< /Review>

The staff complained that they were 20 cents short out of $60.20. Very cheap owners and the store is filthy. Do not recommend this place at all. Very unsatisfactory experience.< /review>

<Review>I came here because my ps4 wasn't turning on  just the white light turn on. the Asian lady was nice she said she will check. free of charge opened the top then took out harddrive and said it looks good. then said it's a corrupt file and she will do a hard reset and it will take 20 minutes and said its $68. I ask if i buy some game would she give me a better deal. she said no way. so I took my ps4 to Cali Games down the street. the bald asian guy there look serious but was was real nice and did a thural check. Free of charge. found out that there  was nothing wrong with my ps4 and said it might be the HDMI cable. happy to hear that I bought a bunch of games and I've made Cali Games shop is my place to go from now on.

Oh and it was the HDMI cord. lol<//Review>< rate>

I would come back because they didn't charge me anything and they are honest. They won't try to sell you unnecessary services.

I don't what solved the issue but I will be sure to come back for any needs due to their perfect customer service!< /review>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Lost a sale plus future business for only $4.99. Told us 1 week ago that we can mix and match their buy 2 get 1 free for Ps3 Ps2 Xbox Xbox 360 Wii games. Cool.

Went there 3 times in the last week and bought alot of Wii games and even my son bought some games. Went today and my younger son had 2 360 games, $9.99 each and a Ps3 games for $4.99.

The same lady who told us we could mix and match told my son he couldn't. When I asked why sehbsaid they didn't do that. When I told her the she told us we could, I could see in her face that she remembered at that moment, she said it was only for that day and she was making an exception for that day only.

I told her she never said it was only for that day. Don't know what the big deal was when they have that buy 2 get 1 free on both ps3 and 360.

Oh well they just sent us to their competition that are with 10 min. Gamestop, Cali games and Stuff for geeks. Sad really. No I gotta post this on my Instagram that has 1000+ followers who always want to know where to buy games.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I love this place and always have to stop in when I’m in the area. Great selection of games, it’s not just an over abundance of sports games. The staff is super friendly and always looking to help me find what I want every time I go in. Definite two thumbs up for retro gaming needs.<//Text>

I come here once a month I don't always buy something unless it's something I've been looking for. All I got to say is that the people that work there are very nice and knowledgeable. In this store you get greeted when you come in. Great service!</Review>

<Text>GREAT little spot: decent selection of games, both new & used; on site repair services; & the staff are thorough, knowledgeable, & are just delightful! Had 3 of my xbox 360's game discs re-there, & all 3 work beautifully now (totally do get a discount the more discs you bring in, too!).

<text>Tons of retro stuff. Chances are if you are looking for a specific console they will have it. Some hard to find games were available but if it's hard to find and in demand (paper Mario, final fantasy, etc) there wasn't much to be found. Still an awesome place.</text>< pics>

Awesome place for anything new or old. "They have it or they'll get it for you."

I've been shopping video games in Torrance since the early 90's in the days of Game Land on Hawthorne. This place is the best I've ever seen. Easy 5 stars.</Review>

I love this place. The staff is friendly and informed, even if you have no previous gaming experience, you can leave knowing you're very well taken care of. There's a variety of games for the ps3 and Xbox 360. They have a ton of games for the newer systems too. They have a wide selection of retro gaming consoles. They buy stuff at a fair price. They do disc cleaning services to take out scratches.<//Text>

Has most games that you would be looking for. The owner and his wife are not much helpful but the guy they hired is awesome. He knows what he's talking about and is super nice. I don't know why they sell candy but, it's a nice add-on.</Review>

This place has a lot of old school games. Something that GameStop and a lot of other game shops do not have. Also for anyone that likes imported games from Japan, they have some Japanese games too. Adding to it they have really good friendly service just in case you are trying to find something specific. I will be coming back here more often!< /Review>

<Review>The owner has a lot of knowledge with games and consoles, ranging from old systems to the latest. Sometimes the games comes out a week before the release date and they have it. Price of games are 7% cheaper than normal price e.a. $59.99 game is 54.99, but this depends on the on the game itself. You can also ask for imported games, albeit there is a requirement of down payment (50%?).

go here around 1pm to closing time at weekdays. The owner is not available in morning and an old guy is currently manning the shop.<//Review><user_name>Richard Joshua Salomon< /user_name><user_id>105827075379266968748</user_id>< Response>

Great local shop with loads of options of both new and classic. Been going there since I was a teenager, but when I picked up an old 360 with controllers and tons of games, their service was incredible and when old products had problems (which is expected of old hardware) their exchange/return policy assured I walked away a happy customer :)<//text>

Went here to buy my friend a few SNES games as a present a few days ago. Staff had great knowledge on games and were able to recommend a few great games that i didn't even know were made.

Shop here if you want to buy hard to find games at reasonable prices.< /review>

I love this place! the service was good, and also their inventory. Another good thing is that their prices are lower than normal retailers (i.e. Mirror's Edge is $24.99 in GameStop, but in Bros. it is $12.99!). This, by far, is the best game shop I've been to. It is also conveniently located next to a pizzeria, just in case you get hungry.  I recommend this place to any game fan.<//text>

This shop is a rare find in this day and age. It's an independent game shop with a wealth of games to exchange for it rent. It reminds me of the shop that rented Commodore 64 games years ago.< /Text>

okay prices, retro/new games is nice but the guy at the time behind the counter was a dick, i had some games that stopped working on my ps3, even tho they seemed fine i thought id still clean em to see if that would fix the problem  (it didnt) and i told him my problem and he just says "are you sure its a ps3 game your putting in your ps3?" like im a small child. im 24 i own alot of consoles, its not like im trying to cram a gamecube game in my ps3, or trying to put a genisis game in a nes. but otherwise . fine place<//Text>

they even have newer games and consoles. (including the nintendo switch, but good luck getting it since they sell out fast.) i've even found some games i was surprised to see considering you rarely see a virtual boy lol.

all in all, this is one of my favorite places to buy any and all my games from, I used to live in gardena and come here every few weeks to buy a game for my NES, sadly though I moved, but I like visiting this shop whenever i'm in town :)< /text></record>

(Translated by Google) They didn't bother looking for the part I needed, they just said it was too expensive and said they couldn't repair it. It has a good variety of video games but it is not the place to repair your equipment

Amazing local sushi spot. Everyone is super nice. They have lunch specials and happy hour specials. Currently due to COVID everything is takeout. But they are still pushing out nothing but quality foods</Review>

We are new to El Segundo and have been trying the local Japanese restaurants, as that is our favorite cuisine. We ordered an assortment of dishes and took them home to eat. The teriyaki sauce is outstanding and the chicken served with it was quite good. The spicy tuna roll was very flavorful without being too spicy. Tuna roll, fabulous. California roll was generous and tasted great. Salmon sashimi was absolutely fresh and delectable. Even the miso soup was the best I have tasted in a long time. To top it all off, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the prices were probably even a little low for this quality of food. Which makes this an outstanding find.<//Review>

<review>I like this place! They provide splendid dishes, their menu is varied, The chef in that spot is very experienced, I enjoy a lot eating all their dishes. The dishes are always of high class, the attitude towards the visitors  is friendly. I  go often to this restaurant and I not even once was unsatisfied. Highly recommended.<//review>< pictures>

Thursday sushi deals are our favorite. They have great rice and fresh fish combos in their rolls. They always give our kids extra tofu in our miso which makes them very happy.</review>

<Text>Best sushi. 5 star.
Seriously understaffed servers looked seriously maxed out and unable to keep up.... not their fault. Full house. No one in management seemed to notice....so about 20 minutes to order a second round of sushi and 20 min waiting for the check. This was a drag. No one watching the ship. Sorry for the 3 star but will think hard before going back< /Text>< Resp>

I don’t usually write reviews and when I do it’s usually a negative experience that makes me take the time to do so. But the experience was so good that I needed to let people know.
Hana Haru is simply the best.The food is amazing, the service is outstanding and the chefs are creating happiness one dish at a time....If your reading this trying to decide if you should go......stop and just go there. You won’t regret it.
Try the rattlesnake roll.</Text>

Some friends and I ended up at Hana Haru  when their neighboring japanese restaurant didn’t allow us to order sushi (another party had ordered 100 pieces of sushi and we were told the one sushi chef working wouldn’t make us any).

Our food was excellent! The sushi and sashimi was very flavorful and nicely presented, and there was little wait. What would help make my rating 5 stars would be to get a little more attention from the wait staff. Our drinks weren’t refilled until we were nearly ready to leave, and we had to ask for that to happen. It would also have been nice to know what time last call would be when we were seated.

Will visit again!<//text>

The food was actually pretty good. Don't be put off by the vibe when you walk in, or the overpowering smell of cleaning chemicals, which is, admittedly, better than than an overpowering odor of fish. But the food is decent. I'll definitely try something different the next time I'm in the neighborhood, but you know, it's serviceable.</Review>

This place has been around for years. I have only visited twice. I think they were here before Sushi was popular. Their product is OK but not amazing. The place was pretty empty both times I was here and could use some updating. I do love the portion size and price. The tempura apatizer was good and a meal in itself.< /Review>

<Review>3 star for the presentation and the cool ambiance. But for the roll taste and quality is just okay. I love to taste more professional sushi roll. Their service is decent. Cuz they are busy so they can just ignore me and my girlfriend. Sad this place cannot be my favorite.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
My favorite sushi joint in LA, hands down. Prices are reasonable, eel is delicious, and salmon is always fresh! Was going here so much at one point the waiter would bring my friend and I our usual drinks when we sat down and one of the sushi chefs knew us by name. Sadly moved away so I do not go here as often.<//Review>

Absolutely my favorite sushi restaurant! Even though I moved 2 hours away I still do my darndest to stop by every chance I get. I always get two Davids rolls- the second (unfailingly) comes home with me to devour later that night.
PLUS, I love all the people that work there.< /review>

Called in a to go order. The food I received was good. Both sushi rolls, edamame and miso soup. The problem was it took 40 mins to get my order. The staff also gave extra food to a to go order for their wait but they arrived after me. Nevertheless, the person after me did seemed to be one that came often but it still felt bad. Again, the food was good but after the service I received, I don't think I'll be returning.</Review>

<review>Pretty sure the noodles they use are just prepackaged low quality noodles. Not a lot of time is put into presentation. There are better Japanese restaurants in the area.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Date>1477664069995< /Date><text>We had Birthday Sushi here, just decided to try it.  It is family owned and has been in El Segundo for 30 years - 15 of those years were with the same family.

I choose from the special menu and had Japanese Sea Bass - sashimi and Scottish Salmon sashimi.  Both very fresh and then my friend and I played with some of the rolls. We tried the external sunshine roll... now that was good !  My friend had some thing with spicy Jalapenos and spicy tuna  a little hot for me.   We finished with deep fried Ice Cream.  Not too bad for a whim !  We will be back !</text>< rate>

< Review>
I would give 0 stars.... but the best thing about this sushi joint was the seats.... and the rice.... the seats are better than the airplanes and the rice was better than the airplane food... well bearly. I would say the reviews that gave me faith in this location.... we're completely misleeading.... it's very sad this was our first sushi place to go to after missing the amazing sushi california has to offer for 3 months. -_-</Review>

<text>I have been coming here for over 6 years.  The food had always been stellar (and they serve brown rice, yippie!!!!) but the service and has been hit and miss.  Tonight, they totally changed that around.  Amazing service (Bailey in particular)!  This trip,  I ordered the Eternal Sunshine roll with brown rice...one I'll dream about!  The tempura combo (w/CA roll) is great also. Love the small town vibe, sushi chefs are personable and know their stuff.  I wish they had a better selection of wine (pinot noir please).  All in all, it's worth a trip to the Gundo!<//text><Rating>4<//Rating><UserId.>103092010873585126724</UserId.><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

<review>I've been going to Hana Haru for about 12 years now.
I'm a sushi connoisseur and have eaten at many awesome places.
But I always come back to this place because William takes care of me.
Portions are large and the service is great.  William won’t serve you fish that is not fresh.
Big heart, big portions, big tummy!  Yummy!  Gotta try it!  I get all the exotic stuff that most newcomers don't eat so my bill comes up a little higher than most.  (Uni, mackerel, live shrimp, toro, fatty yellowtail etc). Gosh, I just got hungry all of a sudden.  Gotta get my eatin dress on and manja.  See you there.<//review>< pics>

The food was really good and our server was very nice. We miss Sizzlers. They closed ours down in Fresno. Glad we found this place.</text>

Seriously sizzler. I picked up my dinner today and 4 steaks were supposed to be well done and they send us 2 medium and one red! Completely red and dripping with blood. My lobster was RAW! I had to put it on my stove to cook it myself! We were so hungry we didn’t want to return it. Worst dinner ever on Mother’s Day! We paid over $100 for this. Don’t order for pick up they’ll just give you what they want to give you.< /review>

I immensely enjoyed my birthday lunch there. The place was immaculately clean with more than adequate seating. The waitresses and hostess were very kind and accomodating. Not to mention the food... Aww man that steak and lobster plate with the buffet added on was just what the doctor ordered. Overall a very enjoyable experience.<//Text>

<Text>Going to be totally  honest . It was definitely not  up to sizzler standards. It started out no salad bar available (ok) so we order off menu.  Then find out they had no license to  sell beer( husband wanted a beer with dinner for his birthday) but stayed anyway . Got worse after that all our food came out cold.  They cooked the steaks wrong (son & husband both ordered  med 1 came out rare 1 was well done) both were chewy (not in the least bit tender ) my Malibu chicken  was ice cold (cheese wouldn't even melt) 2 baked potatoes  were cold butter dudnt melt . Was told our bread was coming & never got it . Worst sizzler experience ever.</Text>< Pics>

<rate>3</rate><text>It's been a long time since I've been there and it was ok, the service was fast, we were served right away and we got our food very fast, I ordered a rib eye steak and it was cooked ok it, my steak was kinda burned or chard and it seemed to have a lot more fat than I didn't care for, and my wife order a 6oz. Tri-tip and a bake potato, her bake potato was cold and her Tri-tip was more raw than medium well done. She told them about the baked potato and they gave her another one but she didn't say anything to them about the Tri-tip. I wish that she would have said something to them about it. Overall good service but the food could use a bit improvement. You how they say don't complain about the food cause of what they may do to your food when you do complain about it.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Sizzlers have been around a long, long time.  It's still a family friendly western style restaurant but they've also managed to keep up with the times to some degree.  The food is good to fair and there's a great variety.   They keep the store clean.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80952f2f411ea0f3:0x76656b07c22e5272< /gmap_id></record>

<review>I immensely enjoyed my birthday lunch there. The place was immaculately clean with more than adequate seating. The waitresses and hostess were very kind and accomodating. Not to mention the food... Aww man that steak and lobster plate with the buffet added on was just what the doctor ordered. Overall a very enjoyable experience.</review><name>James Carter</name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The food was cool. I went and had the salad bar. There were lots of choices for about $13. Hot soups, pasta and green salads prepared my tummy for the main courses. The service was great. The waiters and servers were courteous and welcoming. I am very easy to please. The food was basic yet good.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80952f2f411ea0f3:0x76656b07c22e5272< /gmapID></record>

Perfectly cooked lobster at a buffet, what?  Well that's exactly what you get here.  Forget red lobster, if you are craving lobster this is the place to be.  They have lobster cooking down to a science, they never disappoint.<//text>

The prices are high, the salad bar didn't have much to pick from and only had chicken, tacos and spaghetti with meat balls for the meat, no vegetables and only a couple desserts to pick from.  My husband got steak and lobster for $22.00 and I thought it was a crawdad and the steak was no bigger then the palm of your hand.  Will not recommend to anybody and will not go back.< /Review>

It was my first time and ABSOLUTELY my Last Time of going to that place.
My husband ordered Steak and Lobster, and I was not very hungry so I decided just to have some soup and the girl who took our order charged us for 2 salad bar when I asked her why she told we are charging salad bars to the number of people.
The Funniest thing was, she gave us just ONE plate for salad.
IF you are charging for two people you have to provide plates and bowls and flatware as many people as you charged.
Awful service
Awful staff

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>Everything was GREAT, the food and service was fantastic, best Sizzler in the state, even give you a baked potato with your endless salad bar, only Sizzler in all of California that does this. The night managers are wonderful, they interact with the clientele, the  servers are very personal as well.
Go, Go, Go and enjoy yourself 🙂👍</review><user>110020234184073802262<//user></record>

Sizzler, was great all you can eat Salad Bar/Dessert Bar is a must if you are looking for a place to go for that! So this is it. & with all of the other dishes & plates they are great also so many choices! & please remember to get the garlic cheese bread & a sweet potato with your salad or dinner. (Just ask for it) The prices are good & reasonable & the staff is very good & helpful also.<//text>

<Review>The restaurant is nice inside and seats are comfortable. The salad bar is not outstanding but very good. Try the spaghetti and meatballs; delicious! The macaroni and cheese is good but too soft and creamy. Good if you don't have teeth! The Rice Krispie treat looked good but was dry; need to add more marshmallow cream for sure. The ice tea is great; it's not weak, just right. Service is friendly; big smiles. Good place to dine alone or with a group. If you're in a wheelchair, it's somewhat difficult opening the door. Handicap accessible entrance would be a smart idea.< /Review>< name>

I went out with my family and ordered the steak and all you can shrimp. When my play was brought to me by the manager he asked if there was anything else I would like and I said another order of shrimp. He kind of looked at me as if saying " I just brought you your plate and your asking for another order?" I waited five minutes before my waiter finally showed up.  And asked if there was anything I needed.  I told my order of shrimp. I waited a couple more minutes then he brought it out.  I did not see my waiter again until my wife got his attention and asked for a box for her steak.  We left after that. I usually tip 18-20 percent but the service was terrible the waiter kept helping the same table and ignoring everyone else. The food was bad.  The second order of shrimp was over cooked and too hot to eat. I don't know if my waiter, Clayton was new or not, but needs to learn to help other customers and be fast about it. If he had done that I would've tipped him more than three bucks and I was almost tempted to leave without tipping.<//review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>We ordered through door dash as a treat and the food was horrible. My steak and lobster wasn't too bad. Steak was ok, shrimp was good (obviously, I ate it first) but the mashed potatoes was awful. A small portion and tasted like it came from out of a box. My $4 house salad looked like it came from Mc Donalds. Watered down dressing. My boyfriend's bacon cheeseburger was dry with zero flavor. Don't bother with these guys.<//Text><gmapID>0x80952f2f411ea0f3:0x76656b07c22e5272</gmapID>< time>

Very disappointed ☹️
The lobster was rubbery and dry and discolored, the steak had no flavor, the yams were very watery. The bathroom is nasty had no toilet seat covers and soap dispensers fell off the wall and we're crusty. The service wasn't good. Checked on us once because we made eye contact. The salad bar was great though!!< /Review>

<Text>Delicious food and Randi gave us excellent service. The salad bar was fresh with a lot of different toppings to pick from.  The steak and the shrimp were very good also. They also have huge hamburgers with fresh crispy fries. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it it a little bit pricey.< /Text>< pictures>

The lettuce was old, the taco meat had a weird tatse to it, the tortillas were cold, the chips were stale, the baked potato was old and looked burnt on the outside.  My son's burger was also over cooked.  His french fries were good.<//Text><user>117335840987986935017</user>< Date>

This is one of my favorite places to go eat out at. Amazing staff, great food, decent prices, and an all around good atmosphere. Its seat yourself, and i highly recommend requesting Randi as your waitress. 10/10 would, will, and so recommend for everyone.< /review>

Don't remember this particular experience as it was 4 years ago, but in general, Sizzler's food is rather lackluster and the service isn't very good either. The waitresses there are too bubbly and annoying and pester you when your mouth is full of food</text>

<text>I love  dining at Sizzlers  in Visalia,  CA.  I truly appreciate the  customer service. Not only am I expecting  the  food  to taste  good but for me the cashiers  mannerism must be positive. Lets not leave out the table  server as well. That's much to take into consideration. Thumbs 👆 Sizzlers.</text><Date>1527952918909</Date>< Gmap_id>

<text>It was my Birthday and they surprised me with a personal chocolate cake.

Thanks Sizzler!!

It had been so long since i had been there i forgot my dining 'strategy' and over did it at the taco bar...

Needless to say, i did not get to sample anything else.

I didnt even browse.

Dammut.

I did however manage to get a cup of soft serve ice-cream to go with my little cake which i took home in a box for later.

Thank you Wanda & Kayla :)</text><user>108601550286084238008< /user><date>1571920023626< /date>< name>

<Review>Well about this place I could start by saying all kinds of bad things about this place but would be lying. I give  this restaurant 5 stars there service is excellent staff are very nice do a very good job. I'm a salad lover, and I believe there salad bar has a very good assortment of veggies. And not just there salads are good also there steak, shrimp. Actually this is my favorite place to eat.</Review>< Pictures>

Honestly, food was best quality I've had on a buffet for awhile, I got the lunch buffet for I believe $10.99 including drink and added on a 6 oz steak for $5. The steak exceeded my expectations for sure, obviously wasnt like super high grade beef but it was tender and super flavorful and cooked to perfection. Even as a keto dieter I was able to beyond stuff myself here. Shout out to the taco bar, was able to make a really amazing salad.</text>

Not worth the price there is no selection at the salad bar. fried foods all fatty and grows the clam chowder tasted and like they dumped the corn chowder in with it. The spaghetti  was like 2 day old reheated noodles and the sauce was tasted like stewed tomatoes.no flavor. By far the worst food in town I will never go back. I miss the old sizzler from the 90s that was way better.</review>

Love going for lunch here, had to ask for the fried okra and then they being you your own dish with more than you can eat. It's one of the better sizzlers because they have a lot more choices on the salad bar than the others I have eaten at through out the state.</review>

Not worth the price there is no selection at the salad bar. fried foods all fatty and grows the clam chowder tasted and like they dumped the corn chowder in with it. The spaghetti  was like 2 day old reheated noodles and the sauce was tasted like stewed tomatoes.no flavor. By far the worst food in town I will never go back. I miss the old sizzler from the 90s that was way better.< /Text>

Salad bar had good salad, could have had a few more options. The other food in the salad bar was on the bland side. The steaks were good though. Skip the dessert, even the ice cream tasted not right.<//text>

The food here is okay. But the employees are very rude and have no respect. Came in here with my two children and 1 of my daughter's a don't like sizzler and   I order the salad bar for my other daughter and the employee at the register told me very rudely "they can't share". I was really mad almost walked out of there I understand that I ordered one for a reason. After a while of being there it seemed like they would walk by my table just to see if my daughter's were sharing! Like really I will definitely call corporate!<//Text>

I don't know that I am a fan of ordering as I enter a restaurant... I mean overall, it is a buffet or order at the front desk type of environment... no menu are handed to you. And it's a sit anywhere you want.<//Text>

<review>When I visited the girls at the front register we're rude and in my opinion disrespectful. I saw a family of 3 come into the restaurant and the girls in the front stopped their meaningless conversation and still did not greet the customers. One walked away, the other two started talking about silverware. The family was waiting to be greeted. What seemed like a good 60 seconds then they were acknowledged.<//review>< rating>

I don't know that I am a fan of ordering as I enter a restaurant... I mean overall, it is a buffet or order at the front desk type of environment... no menu are handed to you. And it's a sit anywhere you want.< /Review>

The food here is okay. But the employees are very rude and have no respect. Came in here with my two children and 1 of my daughter's a don't like sizzler and   I order the salad bar for my other daughter and the employee at the register told me very rudely "they can't share". I was really mad almost walked out of there I understand that I ordered one for a reason. After a while of being there it seemed like they would walk by my table just to see if my daughter's were sharing! Like really I will definitely call corporate!</Review>

The food is always the same .But it's a good salad bar.Pizza for kids, tacos fixens, soups , spaghetti with great sauce and meatballs  ,  chicken , or you can order from the menu. A little pricey . But good food. The deserts are just ok. The desert salads are very good .< /Review>

I wondered how many people have served themselves whipped butter which is placed in the desert section next to the whipped cream? Why?? When I asked the worker if this was butter, she Said No, it's mantequila... LOL.. 😐<//text>

I took my sister in law to sizzlers today and normally I love the food and services but today 11/12/18 I ordered all you can eat shrimp and the shrimp was very crunchy and hard to eat I had to go ask for their cheese bread and the waitress didn't check on us to see if we needed anything especially more shrimp I usually never complain but honestly I should've got my money back for not getting what I pay for< /text>

My husband and I stopped in for lunch recently while shopping in Visalia. I had not been to a Sizzler restaurant in about 20 years, however I was surprised how the quality of the food was really good. Our meal wss cooked as ordered and it was tasty. The only difference from 20 years ago was some of the entrees did not include salad, well not what I ordered and there weren't any plates around the salad bar to discourage persons from eating from the salad bar without paying for it, although it is still a good idea just to allow an open salad bar.<//Text>

The 6 oz steak with salad and a baked potato we're great, the salad bar wasn't as good as last time, corn cold and tasteless, no meat other than meatballs. Deserts we're okay. Service was great as always.<//text>

<Review>I was surprised when a buddy told me that he had an awesome steak for dinner the previous night and told me he got it from sizzler. Such an outlandish claim had to be investigated. So I went and checked it out and I was Godsmacked. It was a really good steak cooked perfectly. Far better than applebees or chili's and almost steak house quality. I don't super care for the pay at the front buffet style restaurants but its worth it if I'm in the mood for a steak but don't want to spend $35 a plate at a steak house<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80952f2f411ea0f3:0x76656b07c22e5272<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>After my bariatric surgery, I went there with my husband , he ordered a meal and asked for a side salad bar to share and the waitress made a big tango. The manager came and I explained the situation. He was understanding but the waitress was mad. Not worth it.<//text><pics>None< /pics><rating>1< /rating><userid>115268237561352587713< /userid>< time>

I took my daughter for her 16th bday and for two of us it came out to 50$ i ordered a steak wth potato and the steak came back very small, burnt, and had a very funny taste to it. The service was good and the waittress was very helpful and polite. Overall that will be the last time i go there.<//review>

The staff seemed like they were mad or something. The lobser tail was cold and be gravy and steak was salty but the rest of the food was good.They didn't even tell us about the salad bar + they threw all the good food away. We've never been here before so we didn't know how it worked and we got icecream thinking you could just take it, then after they told us that there was a $3 charge after they saw us taking he food. Probably won't come back!<//review>

Ordered all you can eat shrimp and they brought out crunchy without asking what kind I wanted. I did not want the crunchy shrimp. Poor service. Could not get our drinks refilled.<//review>

(Translated by Google) I wanted to choose only the free menu and the girl at the entrance told me that I should choose an a la carte menu that was more expensive. I think she did not understand what I asked her in English and she did not clarify that she could choose between two types of food, so I was left with the desire to buffet and only ordered a dish

(Original)
Yo quise elegir solo el menú libre y la chica de la entrada me dijo que debia elegir un menú a la carta que era más caro. Creo que no me entendió lo que le pregunté en inglés y ella como no aclaró que podía escoger entre dos modalidades de comida, entonces me quedé con las ganas de buffet y solo ordené un plato<//Text>
