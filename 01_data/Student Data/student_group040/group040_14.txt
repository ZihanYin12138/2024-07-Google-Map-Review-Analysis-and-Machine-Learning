Listen to me, guys. I haven't met such a cordial, helpful, polite, friendly, and professional team at ANY car-related establishment, EVER. John is just the greatest guy. He's always so helpful, can diagnose issues with cars so quickly, and gives fair, affordable prices.

My experience with European Auto Service began last year in January when I returned from the holidays and hadn't drove my car for a while. I live nearby and walked up to the shop at 7:45 AM and was greeted by John. I asked him for a jump, which he was more than happy to provide (he walked half a block to my apartment garage to do so with a smile on his face). He even identified I was having an issue with my trunk latch, which HONDA actually MISDIAGNOSED and told me was a sensor issue (for which Honda would not even refund me). John took one look at the problem, sent me a link to order the latch from eBay at an amazing price, and charged a nominal fee to install it. I was blown away at his kindness and his eye for diagnosing the issue. He even replaced my battery at a fraction of the cost that the dealer was charging.

A year later, I was having issues with my door handle getting stuck. I texted John about this, and before I knew it he had already ordered the part, painted it to match my car, and had it ready to install for me, all within 48 hours.

Folks, if you're having issues with your car, contact John at European Auto to see if he can help before you ask anyone else. This gentleman is simply the best. Even when I move away, I'll be coming back to see these guys for a long time to come.<//Text>

I went to this Place for several problems with my Land Rover. John is fantastic. He was swamped with work but yet managed to squeeze me in. His prices were very reasonable and he kept me in the loop as he completed the work. Hands down a great place to go especially for you Land Rover owners. John and his staff definitely know there stuff!!! Five star for this place. Thank John.

<review>The best car mechanic in town. I highly recommend European Auto Service without reservation. John and his crew are knowledgeable, experienced, reliable, and, most importantly, honest. It is the only car mechanic that I trust in LA. My car broke down just before the Christmas holiday. John took all the effort to identify the issue, and he fixed it. I was shocked when I heard the total cost. I paid significantly less than other car mechanics offered. Thank you for everything.</review>< Pics>

Took my bmw 328i in because it was leaking oil and was shaking when idle. John said we would need to fix the valve cover gasket and spark plugs. I picked up my car the following day and the car was still shaking but he said it was because the water pump needs to be replaced, but I told him I would come back. The next day the service engine light came on (it was never on before I took my car in) I called and he said it is probably from the water pump. I took my car to another mechanic and he told me the car was still leaking oil and the valve cover gasket was not properly replaced which is what caused the service engine light to come on. Also, the mechanic told me the service engine light does not come on because of a bad water pump, which shows the kind of people I was dealing with. I had to pay extra to get my car repaired correctly from another mechanic. I will not be bringing my car back here. Do not let their cheap prices fool you. You get what you pay for.< /Text>

I took my Mercedes Benz in to get a oil change and was wondering why it was $100. I took it to my normal mechanic and he showed me that they never changed my oil! My oil was empty! This place is a scam! Don't ever take your car to this scamming place! I'm glad I took my car to a real mechanic before my engine blew out! This place needs to be put outta business! Don't trust them!!! Valencia European motors is the place to take your Mercedes not this untrustworthy place! Close this place down!! I'm sure I'm not the only one they cheated outta my money</Review>

First, I'll stick to the facts, and then I'll give you my final opinion. ;) (En Español: Simplemente, este señor no sólo habla Español, pero es honesto, no muy caro y hace buen trabajo-GRACIAS JOHN!) My battery kept dying and AutoZone repeatedly told me that my battery was fine but that it was actually my alternator's fault (I bought it from them and to be honest, they usually give me great service and advice, over all, however this time, unfortunately they misdiagnosed the alternator as faulty when it was actually the battery all along! (Word to the wise). John determined as much in LESS than 5 minutes and saved me MORE than $300 in parts and $300 in labor because I had already purchased the alternator on a whim, just in case, assuming they were right when I should have gotten a 2nd opinion from the very get-go. At the end of the day, John not only DIDN'T charge me ANYTHING for diagnosing my car but even called AutoZone for me to let them know that I was exchanging a defective battery with them and to expect me! In the end, John refused to charge me anything for testing my alternator or diagnosing & won over a new customer for life, possibly! Afterwards, I asked him to at least allow me to pay him to replace the glow plugs on my TDI VW Passat and they made it happen for me that same day for next to nothing!! "Honest, affordable and fast" they say it doesn't exist, I beg to differ. :D
Gracias John y compañía !!!</text>

I’m generally skeptical of all auto shops. I’ve taken several of my cars here and now I recommend it to everyone I know. They are consistently reliable and honest. The costs are the lowest I’ve found in LA for real service. They know their business.</Text>

0 STARS!!!!!  ****DO NOT TAKE YOUR MERCEDES BENZ TO EUROPEAN AUTO SERVICE...**** They will send it to another shop that will totally destroy it!!!!!  My Transmission oil-pan leaked transmission fluid, and the cover needed to be replaced.  At the advice of a friend, I took it to Rene.  I was assured that "EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY!"  After about three weeks, I called, they said it would cost $400.  I came in a few days later to learn the repairs would cost $2,600, but I still wasn't able to pick up my car, and my job said I needed my car in order to work.

I told Rene my situation, and he promised to have the car to me in a few day.  I picked up the Benz a few nights later, but it ran funny.  My Benz came from Fletcher Jones, so the engine ran smooth as a purring Cat.  However, after the repairs, my Benz ran like a jalopy.  The engine was loud, and I had problems shifting the gears.  There were now black wires under the hood, and I could tell someone did work to the engine, which I did not agree to.  Once I got the car back for a second time; I had to push the car forward and back to get it to start.  Finally, after about a week, the stick shift got stuck.  I ended up losing my job, because I didn't have a Car, which the job required.  When I called and told Rene about the problem, he asked to have the Car so he could get it repaired.   Why in the HELL would I trust anybody who would send a Mercedes Benz to a Mexican Auto-Mechanic Shop that received 1-Star on yelp?  I called Mercedes Benz, and explained the problem.  The expert said that the cost for my problem should not have cost more than $400.

I feel that Rene was playing the middle man, and trying to get paid though a different shop worked on the Car.  I DID NOT APPRECIATE HIM SENDING MY CAR TO ANOTHER SHOP WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE, OR APPROVAL.

When I told him about the ratings of the shop he sent my car to, he had the nerve to say, "I know you're telling the truth, because another one of my customers said she had the same problem with her car."

REALLY! (You don't believe me unless another customer has the same problem?  First of all, you have NO BUSINESS sending customers cars to other shops.......PERIOD!  If I wanted another shop, I could have taken it to another shop myself.  You should have told me in advance that YOU COULDN'T FIX IT!)

I DON'T TRUST EUROPEAN AUTO SERVICE, AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU!

I ended up losing my beautiful Benz, with only 107K miles, because Mercedes said the damage inflicted to the engine would now cost an additional $5,000, OR MORE to repair.  I only owed $4,000 more for the Benz, so why would I pay $9,000 when I could buy a new one?  I just hate that I lost my beautiful Car over trusting someone who was dishonest with me...<//text>

< Review>
A belt on my 08 Volvo S40 with 54k miles snapped and went into engine charring and bending the valves and gaskets, which caused the timing belt to go and a bunch of others things only work when the engine operates. Living in Palm Springs its slim pickings. I got an estimate from a shop I was referred to by a friend they wanted $4k to rebuild the engine this included a $295 initial diagnosis. Which meant sending the valves to a machine shop to reshape and refurbish (I suspect bending back into shape will never be the same again and most likely have issues in the long run even if 3yr/36k warranty on repairs). I told another friend who was outraged and had me speak to John at European Auto. John carefully explained that he wouldn’t rebuild for the obvious reasons instead he suggested a certified used engine (with 5 year/unlimited mileage warranty) plus all the additional work as needed per warranty specs all for the total of $3345 or 20% less than the PS mechanic. John got me the engine info to purchase directly so that I could feel comfortable he wasn’t marking it up. I had it delivered to his shop and once it arrived, it took 1.5 days to complete all along sending me pics and texts of the progress. When I went to pick up my car there were no surprise costs or fees it was exactly what he quoted from day one even though he realized once the engine arrived some additional parts had to be replaced in order to comply with the warranty. He also serviced my car until the next 20k.

I drove back to PS the same day, 137 miles and not a single problem or noise. I’m so glad I had the AAA to tow it that far because I’m member at no cost. I can say that John and his team did great work, more over saved me quite a bit of money but also gave me peace of mind in getting work done that will last some time considering the cost. John couldn’t have been more attentive, considerate and service friendly. If I’m ever in need of work I’m bringing it back. When it comes time to service it I’m bringing it back. When someone I know needs an honest, caring and diligent auto mechanic and I sending them to John.<//Review>

You will truly never meet a mechanic like Rene. He is the most honest man. I have brought my car in for a total brake job and he called me to tell me the back brakes were fine instead of just changing them to make more money. All of the work I have ever had done over the past two years since I started going to him has lasted and worked great. His prices are on average half the cost of anywhere else I call and I check every time because I drive all the way from Long Beach to come here. He is that good!< /review>

All of the other staff are awesome too but Rene is the reason why i go here...because he really cares. If u dont know much about cars (like me) he wont take advantage of u and over price u.

John, the owner, is one of the most highly knowledgeable and no-nonsense people I've ever had work on my BMWs. He's helped me diagnose problems on my 1976 BMW 2002 and a few of the mid 90's 5 series I've owned over the years. Anything from an oil change to a manual transmission swap -- You can trust that he'll get the job done quickly and cost-effectively.  Thanks!< /text>

Rene provided great service at an excellent price. There's no need to pay the dealer their over inflated prices. I'm happy to have this reliable, neighborhood shop.< /review>

<review>I recently visited European Auto Services, because my Range Rover's "Air Suspension Inactive" dash board light was on. (This is a common problem with Range Rovers).

Rene, was very helpful and fixed it for me with no hassle. He also took the time to explain to me specifically what had caused my problem.

He is an honest mechanic who is good at what he does and listens to customers to understand their issues before he starts diagnostics.

I recommend European Auto Services to anyone who is tired of being reaped off by other mechanics.<//review>< response>

Rene and Jack, and the shop family there at European and are more than a girl could ask for in a time of crisis. I had been in an accident, at fault was the other driver... I saw Rene about repairing mył truck, and he really does care.

I'm not from here but as I intend to stick around the west coast for a while I will definitely be making the trek down for improvements and upkeep of truck truck.
I trust and enjoy them that much.</text>

Rene, is most likely to be the best mechanic in the area, he is honest, and has proven trustworthy, I would recommend him to anyone that had bad experience with other mechanic shops, he will prove that there still are ethical people in the auto repair business, if you want the high prices, and the constant run around,  then stick with your existing shop, however if you want to experience a real professional, and an honest person who really cares about his customers, than you you should meet Rene, a true gentlemen,  a real mechanic with forty years of experience, the only drawback is the waiting issue, his shop is so busy, you have to be patient.</Text>

Been going to this location ever since I received my first paycheck, which is about 6 years ago.. This place is gold when you find a barber that understands their craft, and Gus is definitely one of them: He has a good eye for each clients situation, and will take his time if he needs to create a perfect cut. I advise having lunch before showing up, and he takes appointments too. The balder fade is from my second visit, the first pic is from my walk-in meeting Gus for the first time, good barber.</Review>

They're not barbers. They're not beauticians. They're butchers. They didn't give me what I asked for and I showed the "barber" a picture and told him i didn't want a lot of hair taken off. He did what they do best....chop it all off</text>

<Review>Favorite place to get my haircut at. Their service is great, but also means they are busy. Highly highly recommend scheduling an appointment before walking in. Otherwise you’ll be waiting some time.< /Review>< pics>

The Barber by the name of Sal A. Did an amazing job, I took my 3 year old in there and he is a difficult one, however sal made it look easy and my boys haircut came out amazing. Definitely taking him there again for his haircut and mine as well.</text>

<Text>Barber shop on one side and Beauty salon on the other. They are very professional and love what they do. I love my hair! The Beauty Salon offers many other services such as eyebrow microblading, nails, and make up. I definitely recommend them.<//Text><Rating>5<//Rating><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I grab a combo plate every time I'm in the area. The service is quick and they are nicely set up to be compliant with COVID safety. I have no complaints about the food.

On a few occasions I've witnessed the employees handle some difficult customers very professionally.<//review>

Im in construction so I travel up and down the coast so everytime I get a job up in this part of time I always stop and eat here. I drive big work truck with a trailer so the parking is awesome 👌prices are worth the price so don't listen to stingy reviews. For teriyaki flavor this is one of the best I have tasted....good job. Staff is always very professional. Thank again</text>

I used to work at Scripps Hospital, Encinitas and always used to eat here. The food is fantastic. Since moving out of the area ever time I visit down south I always make the trip to eat here. It is that good and highly recommend to everyone. You will be hooked for life!</text>

<review>Like other reviewers, I've been coming here for over 20 years... since it was called 'Tokyo Teriyaki'. Its changed names about 4 times. The food was good then, and the food is 'meh' now. My kids love it and thats why we go.

Over the years the portions have gone way down and the prices have gone way up. I get it... its expensive to be in encinitas. But its rice and meat. COG's cant be more than .50 per plate and they are charging $13.

On top of that, they have the ubiquitous digital card reader that assumes you want to leave a tip.

Not all progress is good Surf Brothers. Please look at your vendors and your prices and remember where you started.</review><response>{'time': 1582131445716, 'text': "Hey Ryan,\n\nI thought I responded to you already but I just saw this again.

Surf Brothers is absolutely delicious I love their brown rice it's the best rice I ever had in my life!
They are always busy but they are so fast you won't even have time to sit down and have a drink if your order is to go!
I love going there staff is really friendly the place is really clinging and it's good fast and  unexpensive!< /Text>

If all you want is meat and rice this is the place for you! The chicken is good. Beef is so-so. I personally did not like the texture or flavor. They don't have any side dishes except for a salad/coleslaw. Their teriyaki sauce is good. Make sure you ask for extra!  Speaking for myself...I won't be back. :(
Side note...the staff is very friendly</review>

I like to get the lite bite chicken or steak "opposite" (more coleslaw than rice), then mix it all together with a lot of their signature sauce and siracha. Delicious and healthy</review><date>1497608791243<//date>< pics>

Delicious teriyaki chicken and beef. No need to call in your order, they can serve a small order quite quickly in the restaurant. It’s a small menu, but they do it all well.<//Text>

Let me 1st start off with saying they have a very friendly staff but the greed of the company is unreal.

I've been coming to this restaurant for  15 plus years, the entrees back then were about $8. Most recently ( as in maybe a month ago) the price for an entree with double meat was about $13 now the price has jumped to north of $17 ....

For this price I can eat a meal with an ocean view lol

How can you justify these prices?

If your food costs are too high find a better  supplier  business 101<//Text>

< Review>
Just showed up at your Encinitas location at 6:50 after checking the website that stated open till 8:00 on Sunday. The girl refuses to serve us and states they are closing early. There was another gentleman in there waiting for his food. When I state closing time is 8:00 she starts stammering about Father's Day. It seemed like she just wanted to get out of there. Either your website should have "holiday hours" posted or you should get some employees who want to do their job. We have had catering provided on three separate occasions but will not be returning to this location again.</Review>

Good food. The beef, although good, can be a little dry on occasion. The chicken is consistently excellent.< /review>

<Text>DELICIOUS! Really, Surf Brothers Teriyaki has delicious food and they are very quick. While food choices are pretty much limited to chicken, steak, or both, I think this is why their service is so quick and their food so good.</Text>< Pics>

They have amazing sandwiches and shakes/smoothies. Owners are very nice and friendly. It is located inside Mercy San Juan medical center, but everyone can visit and order food.</Review>

Excellent service and food. Wooden table and metal chairs  need to be replaced.  Tables are always sticky and metal chairs are very cold.  Customers as sick patients need better chairs  and tables.  Is time to change<//Review>

<Review>I love their Food however, I do think they need to do some changes to their menu and hire more people to work with them so the line gets shorter. I gave them 5 stars because the owner is honest about what's inside the food your eating. He understands customer service very clearly, and it's very clean café knowing it's inside clinics. I really wish them the best! :)<//Review><username>Nooran Hassan< /username><Rating>5</Rating><Time>1508267544970<//Time>< Resp>

Friendly, professional and efficient!
I was just hired and the company is currently WFH. I only had a laptop for the first few days to get me by. Once I was hired, I was given their info and told to call to get set-up. I optioned to start sooner than later and time was of essence. I sent them a text to see if they were available at 6pm on a Friday!?! He replied quickly and said to call him whenever. Long story short, by 8pm I was up and running with everything I needed for Monday and he made himself available over the weekend just in case.< /review>

Absolutely amazing!  We have been using Wendego for a few years and they have never failed to impress.  Their team blends seamlessly into ours.  Many other IT partners feel like a glorified call center, but not Wendego.  They truly embrace the partnership and will support you in all your needs with unrivaled expertise.  Fully endorse them!< /review>

<text>Wendego has continually been professional and efficient. I have personally had the pleasure of working with them for 2+ years now. They are always quick with their service, and even take calls on weekends. I especially enjoy working with Kam for all of our IT needs at Host Healthcare!</text>< pictures>

I've been working with Wendego IT Solutions for the past 7 years. When faced with a problem they don't have an immediate answer for, they do not give up until they have a solution. Their quick response time and positive attitude makes them a continued pleasure to work with.< /Review>

Wendego has been a godsend for my business. I spent a couple of years bouncing between IT consultants, none of which was able to get my business' IT under control. Within weeks of bringing Eidan and his team on board, our Internet service was spotless, our VOIP worked flawlessly, and our network was always up and running. Finally. That was 3+ years ago and our IT setup has been near perfect (even through an office move and lots of expansion) ever since. So nice to not have to worry about IT anymore. A++. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<//text>

Having dealt with several different IT services companies in the past, I can tell you that Wendego is the first genuinely customer focused IT services company that I have encountered. The Wendego Team goes above and beyond every time to resolve issues, plan for our future needs, educate our company on best practices, and improve our current IT processes. Everyone at my company is grateful for their unparalleled support. I highly recommend Wendego for any business that is either looking for a new IT partner or looking to outsource their IT needs to a best-in-class organization.

Our company couldn't post for 3 days now, the problem is still not solved.
They make it extraordinarily difficult to contact support; instead, you are guided to absolutely useless help sites.

For me, this is not a reliable, professional business platform!< /text>

****LinkedIn resolved this issue and refunded my money****

Apparently once you cancel your subscription,  LinkedIn will continue to withdraw funds from your account.   I've been a member for 20 years, they owe me 2 months.  I cannot get a hold of a person, a chat or direct email.  I believe I'll be closing this account.

I just reported this to the BBB, maybe ill get contact info that way!<//Text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Linkedin breaks the law on the protection of personal data. The company makes it difficult and even impossible to delete data from its website. At the same time, it blocks the account for fake reasons that it does not inform users about. The company does not hide the contact and options that allow you to resign from using the platform, and the service staff resemble 2-year-old children to whom it is impossible to write normally.

This company should be dealt with by the EU and impose huge fines.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>I'm really disappointed in LinkedIN Premium. The only thing that happened was I got a lot more attention from outside individuals trying to sell leads to me. LinkedIN needs to figure out a way to stop the basement selling of scam lead generation. AND I cannot cancel premium. They removed the unsubscribe button or cancel option. The only option under "Manage your premium account" is to upgrade. You are trying to be the voice of good communication and have much to learn. Now I'm in a waiting line to "chat" just to cancel. Don't be tricked into the free 30 days cancel at any time, they will not let you cancel. Bad business LinkedIN.< /review>< pictures>

Having been a member on LinkedIn for over a decade I am disgusted that your automated system has blocked my account because a few weeks ago I began manually messaging my contacts.

That this is the first time I have made such contact makes your behaviour all the more wrong.

Particularly that making contact with others is the point of your site and the number of messages has been less than 50 per day.

Your actions are abhorrent and irresponsible.</Review>

Full disclosure I do have a account on LinkedIn but it makes me feel dirty. Their mantra “It not what you know it who you know” sends the wrong message. It may be true,(but sicking too)  at least to some extent, but  to someone who believes in promotion by merit it goes against the grain.<//review>

I have to agree.  LinkedIn customer service?  What's that?  You can't find a phone number to call that works.  No chat.  No e-mail.

I changed companies and forgot to update my e-mail from the old company I was using to sign on. I sent them my driver's license copy they require for that like 3 weeks ago.....zero response.< /review>

LinkedIn changed my girlfriend $650 at the end of her free trial. Then they said they issued the refund but her bank never received it... Also this company doesn't have a customer service phone number, which seems very sketchy.</review>

What a terrible Terrible customer support!
something happened to my account and I was not able to login.  I contacted support immediately.  Support did do NOTHING just sent me few pre-scripted messages and was quick to "close" the case without any resolution.  The support is a bad bad joke in this company.  dear LinkedIN i welcome you to follow-up on this UNRESOLVED issue to me directly.  please and thank you</text>

This is a company ran by SJWs. Look at how they curate their news section, it's full of lefty articles such as the mythological gender (a social construct now apparently) pay gap that has been disproven time after time. The site has a lot of spam, bots, fake jobs, adverts that are quite invasive. Why on earth would anybody give them their business. Also what about their premimum badge nonsense? Talk about a ripoff. The app is decent, but cluttered with fake jobs. Again, this is nonsense.</review>

LinkedIn doesn't care at all about their users, it's all about the numbers with them. Once you have a problem with your account or need help in any way even for upgrades they don't respond. Like a lot of large companies, they figure it's cheaper to advertise for new customers than to take care of existing ones. Even Comcast finally figured out that doesn't work. Truly the worst customer service I have ever encountered.<//Text>

I'd rate them at less than one star if I could. They have no customer service, if you have a problem you cannot contact them, they've designed the website to make that impossible. I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul for horrible user experience and customer service.</text>

They would get a better rating if they had a better system on cleaning restrooms quicker .  I suggest  they hire a men for men's restrooms and women for women's restroom and keep the restrooms clean with out shutting them down for cleaning.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808fb70111b43335:0x9063a4c45f7c7e72</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I don't particularly like LinkedIn.  I don't like the idea of unknown people connecting and adding you to their network.  I would rather store my CV and personal information on CV Library as the employers can access your details through their database.< /Review>

Large spacious liquor store with a lot of refrigeration space. Always clean and the people behind the counter are friendly and helpful. When I happen to be working in an area that I am not familiar with finding a place like Canyon Liquor can help with navigation and picking up a few cold ones.< /review>

I can schedule an appointment over the phone, they remind me when my animals need their shots, and, they don't charge an arm & a leg for everything.

Also, huge bonus, they're all really friendly!</review>

<Review>The animal health center in Salinas is where little Fella was spaid. They've also seen her for shots and a dental exam. They're great with her and refer to the animals by name. Their office always gives me a follow-up call after her appointments just to see how she's doing. It's been nice to have a veterinary staff that feels like a part of your fur baby's family. Thanks for taking good care of my pup!</Review>< pics>

<text>Love this place. My dog had a skin condition and despite taking him to other vets he suffered with his condition for quite some time. The Animal Health Center diagnosed his condition immediately and now he is doing great. They also offer boarding and do an excellent job with my two dogs. I know feel comfortable traveling knowing they are well taken care of.<//text>< Date>

I've been taking my dog to other vets and no one could tell me what was wrong with her. One trip to the Animal Health Center they found out she was allergic to poultry products I've been taking her here since.</Text>

<Review>Friendly and attentive staff. Wait times can be a bit long though to be honest. I would knock 1 or 2 stars because of that but they are helping so many clients. The small office can become very tight and overwhelming quickly. The doctors and staff again make up for this by being informative and helpful.<//Review>< user_id>

I took my dog 15 year old rat terrier mix in.  I thought ear infection should have been the diagnosis but I was wrong.  Good thing I didn't self medicate her.  Fair prices excellent service,  Gentle exam and very thorough  She's good to go a few more years. I am happy to have my best friend back.  The only down side was the receptionist.  She was a little squeamish  about fleas.  They are not pleasant but they are part of a veterinarians office.  One of many common pet problems.  It's not like  it jumped on her and fed.  It was a bit daunting having to catch and kill the bug then watch her push away from me disgusted.  She won't last long in that profession if little stuff like that bother her.  The one good thing is the medical assistants and doctor way outshines her

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>These people are fantastic. everyone from the lady at the front desk to the doctor. I took my Ace in after he fell very ill and he stopped being able to get up. He got so much worse once we were in there. Unfortunately, this was his last vet visit ever, since an infection had gotten into his brain. While I was blubbering like an idiot, the staff was very empathetic and very professional. They gave us as much time as we needed and were very helpful every single step of the way. They were gentle to Ace, my fiance and myself. While it was my first time there and under very crummy circumstances, I have to give them 5 stars for their excellent service and professionalism during a very hard time of my life. Thank you ladies. We will be taking our pets to you as long as you are open for business. We can trust you with our spoiled pets.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808df8f68a2840a1:0x65d5f60bb91c5490< /Gmap_id></record>

I have had such a fantastic experience with animal health center. We recently adopted a rescue dog and called to get him in for an appointment. I was able to get him in the same day. He had a lot of different ailments because of being kept in bad conditions. Being a first time dog owner we didn’t have any clue what we were doing. They helped guide us in the right direction and our dog is doing so much better. We still have a long road but little by little he is improving. The staff is awesome and they absolutely love him.</Text>

Apparently there is a new vet and the female veterinarians have retired. Bad experience. I had to ask 3 times to speak with the vet.  When he did come out, I felt like he hadn't even looked at my cat. He wasn't aware of all the issues I brought the cat in for, and that I had clearly explained to the tech thay came out to collect the cat from my car. Yes Covid has required changes in business practices but they seem to be extra disorganized here.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>In my opinion, Animal Health Center is the best vet hospital in the Monterey/ Salinas area. The staff there is extremely friendly and welcoming. They also have an entire team of veterinarians with various specialties and expertise, whom are very knowledgeable and their number one priority is to get your pet well. What I like most about Animal Health Center is they are one of the few vets within 100 miles to offer both conventional and natural treatments. I have been taking my 11 year-old handicapped pug, Piglette there for nearly 2 years now. All of the treatments (laser therapy and water therapy) and remedies Piglette received has had very positive results in improving her quality of life. The other thing I like about Animal Health Center is they offer high quality pet food brands that you either cannot find or are hard to find at pet/ grocery stores. Recently they just opened a new location in Seaside which I would say is worth checking out too. I have been to a handful of other vets in the area and none of the others offered the variety of treatments or level care for my pug as Animal Health Center.</Text>< Time>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>TLDR: I came for a recall for my 2009 Honda Fit and was told I needed over $700 worth of work and they gave me a flat tire and refused to take responsibility for it.

I brought my car here last week for a drive shaft recall. When I picked it up a few days later, they had done an inspection and told me it needed a lot of work and that replacing the spark plugs and fixing a leaking oil valve would cost $700 (classic dealership inflation).

I left and had barely driven around the block when the low tire pressure light went off. I pulled over and checked the pressure on all my tires and found that, despite the tires supposedly being checked in the inspection, one tire was 10 pounds below pressure.

I drove back to the dealership and they found a nail in it and offered to fix the flat for free. When I came back 20 minutes later, they insisted the flat was NOT from the nail, but from the tire pressure sensor being loose. They said the people who replaced my tires must have installed the tire pressure sensor wrong and that they couldn't fix it, so I needed to take it back there. I explained that I bought my tires NINE months ago, so if this was an issue, it should have arisen way before this, but they refused to do anything else to fix the tire.

Never going back here.

Update: I took my car to Torchio's mechanic downtown and they looked it over and told me NOTHING was wrong with it.<//Text>< pictures>

<time>1620667484287<//time><Resp>None</Resp><Review>I recently had my car serviced here, upon picking up the car I noticed grease stains on the ceiling where a mechanic had touched it with dirty hands. So I went into honda today and a worker named "Eddie" was quick, attentive and gave excellent customer service. He immediately began cleaning the stains and left the ceiling looking better then before. He did it all with a positive attitude and 15min later I was on my way.
People like Eddie are why I choose honda of berkeley to service all my vehicles.
Keep up the good work.< /Review><user>107605629172803075405<//user></record></dataset><record>

Great Service with a best price! I choose this is close to home, so I could get in touch with them quickly and with this best price too. Great guest big parking and waiting room. No food and car wash! Only snack and few vitamin  juice, soda, co-cola and water. These need to paid for it. By looking for healthy food, you might need to bring some money if you are planning to wait in the lobby for a long time! A supermarket and few restaurant near by .Giving 5 stars because good price! Employee very kind! Good communicate! Please come and visited the store again!</Review>

So, I scheduled an appoint with a pick up time of 4. They said they would call before and confirm pickup. They didn't call, so I walked and called them. They let me know they were behind schedule. So, when I get there they tell me my rear wheel cylinders are leaking and need to be repaired. I told them I would take it to my regular mechanic. So, I did, and they couldn't find anything wrong with the car. They couldn't understand why they would push an unneeded repair. So I called to complain, no answer from a manager. Then I filed a complaint with the BBB and they could not get a response. I don't trust them at all.</text>< pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Bought my brand new honda civic on early 2018. It was the 4th car I bought from them as I had my friend Jorge there, but at this time he had already left.  Was forced to buy a 100k bumper to bumper warranty worth 1.9k and when I took delivery of the car it was raining and couldn't inspect properly and saw it next day. Went back to them to show that and they claimed it probably got hit when I parked and said "Those happen sooner or later, now that it already happened, you won't have that pain again." Car had a thumping noise on rear left when going over bumps and they claimed it was issue on all hatchback civic, which was a lie.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Had an appointment to look at a specific car, got there, told the car was just sold and it was the only one on the lot. Got the run around and was offered to purchase another car, different color, that was on the way and would be there in 2-3 hours. Drove a long ways for nothing when we were told their inventory was plentiful. Terrible experience and awkward location for a dealership.< /text>< pics>

<text>I am currently evaluating options to sell my car since I am no longer in need of a vehicle so I reached out to this location about value. The Sales Manager Brent was very unprofessional in his emails to me and rude. He offered me a very low figure ($3,000 to 5,000) less than the current estimated value and when I told him I was not interested, he told me to "good luck trying to sell it on craigslist." Avoid this location.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Ricky was very helpful as soon as I arrived for my service. He made it very easy to pick out the options for my 60k mile service. Once I confirmed my service, Ricky called me a Lyft to where I needed to go. Once my car was finished,  he called me a Lyft back to Honda! Everything with my car service was great!</text>

<review>Horrible post-car buying experience.
They processed our loan through the wrong bank and it took them 6 weeks to cancel our initial loan. We were promised the issue was taken care of from multiple people but received no follow up or confirmation. They simply do not care about taking care of you after making a purchase. I was so frustrated that I was extremely close to filing a complaint.
UPDATE: 2 months after having the car, the windshield accumulated dirt and debris. I went to use the windshield wipers and wipe away the dirt. To my surprise there were no wiper fluids! How they remain in business is beyond me.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I recently completed the purchase of a 2019 Honda CR-V from Berkeley Honda.

Put simply, they took great care of my wife and I from our initial contact through the end of the process. Specifically, I would like to call out owner Tim Beinke and internet manager Brent Miletich.

Brent was our main point of contact throughout the transaction and, really, I could have asked no more of him. After much pondering, my wife and I narrowed our potential color choices down to 3 interior/exterior "finalists." One was white, but the other two were "riskier" choices (not your basic grey/silver/white) and Brent went out of his way to let us see an example of each choice. Once we made our ultimate decision, Brent patiently and carefully went over the post-purchase setup details (all the electronics settings, pairing phones, etc.) and sent us off in style.

As mentioned, we made a specific choice of what we wanted, rather than a simple selection from existing inventory. Owner Tim Beinke got involved in the process, found the exact car we were looking for at another dealership, and did all the behind the scenes stuff to get that specific vehicle faster than I ever thought possible. And, he worked with us to get a more than fair price.

In summary, we got exactly what we wanted at a very fair price. Not sure what more one can ask.</text>

I took my Honda Civic here because some of their services were slightly cheaper than Oakland Honda. I called ahead to check prices and coupons and the rep, Eric I think, was so courteous and helpful!

But some of the services are slightly more expensive than Oakland, so I recommend you doing your homework. However, it was quick, easy, and painless.< /review>

Bad maintenance management. Called to ask about an advertised offer. They told me they could have the car for me in two days if I came in and filled out an application. So I drove all the way over there (one star to Bay Area traffic, too) and walked in and they literally laughed at me because they don’t even carry that car. Then they tried offering me another (more expensive, obviously) car. Every suspicion and frustration I have towards car dealers confirmed.<//Review>

My reason for giving this dealership a one star rating was because of Peter Waschkowsky, who is the Internet Sales Manager of Honda of Berkeley. I presented to Peter a quote offer from another dealership, and he stated to me: "At that price they are losing alto of money. Not interested." Peter sent me another stating that his dealership strives for competitive pricing and that if I had another offer price from another dealership, I should present it to him. Initially, I presented one from Oakland. He told me that Oakland had made an error that it was a standard transmission. Peter Waschowsky lied in the email that the model I was offered was a standard transmission when Oakland had already told me it was a CVT transmission, which I was intending to purchase. Peter Waschowsky's last words to me via email was: "Run there and say nothing." This place is a joke and filled with degenerate morons. Don't do business with Honda of Berkeley. The interesting fact this person responded with grammatical errors and in a churlish manner gave me the impression that these people are clowns who belong in a circus and not in the business of selling vehicles.<//text>

<Text>Our experience buying a car at Berkeley Honda was extremely disappointing. The sales staff were not welcoming in any way, and it seemed from the very beginning like they had no interest in selling us a car. Our salesman could not answer any of our questions about the used vehicle we were looking at. He left us sitting in the lounge for about 45 minutes while they were theoretically "inputting things in the computer" meanwhile all of the staff were just sitting around socializing.

Then, when we asked about negotiating the price of our vehicle, the staff were very unprofessional and were yelling at the top of their lungs down the hall about how we couldn't negotiate the price of the vehicle. We finally left with our vehicle after being rushed through some paperwork by the finance officer who was the only pleasant person we encountered at Berkeley Honda. We definitely will not be returning here for any sales or service in the future because I was more capable of acting like an adult when I was eight years old than any of the sales staff at Berkeley Honda.<//Text>< gmap_id>

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST! They are unprofessional, rude, and scammers. They will waste your time and then at the end of the day, they will refuse to sell you a car just because they don’t like you. They are racist and disgusting. If you need a car, it’ll be better for you to go somewhere else. DONT BUY A CAR FROM THEM!<//review>

After the service Ryan didn't tell me when my next appointment (service) was. At the end I tried to talk to the managers but didn't seem to care much. I received a phone call from someone from Berkely honda after a few days and then I complained properly. This lady told me that they were going to call me soon and offered me a "courtesy". That was 3 weeks ago and he never called again. I'm very disappointed with this dealership, very bad service and disrespectful to customers. I understand that they can be busy but nobody came to even say hello or to tell me that I should wait a bit or invite me to sit in their lounge while I waited. Not even when I complained!  I also run a business and I would never do that to a customer, that's disrespectful. They never treated me like that in SF honda. I went to this dealership because I moved to Berkely from SF, but after this I rather drive to San Francisco if I need service or renew my car.  I won't recommend Berkeley Honda to anyone so i can save them from a bad experience.</Review>< pictures>

Check their work whenever possible, like marking an oil filter to make sure they changed it. I had my car serviced there, and I had to point out to them that they didn't top off fluids, which were part of the service package.< /Review>

Go to El Cerrito Honda instead! The worst customer service experience I have ever had was with their service department. They kept me on hold for 10-20 minutes at a time, they disconnected me, they lied about the services they offer, they said they would call me back and never did. I dealt with this for two weeks then finally called El Cerrito Honda. They booked an appointment for my request in less than 2 minutes, and the repair was complete in less that 6 hours.</Review>

The jist of it is that, while many of the lower level employees here were quite friendly, my "service advisor" Rory and his boss, the on duty manager, were both extremely defensive and dismissive when I asked basic questions about pricing and promotions. I took my car here for a simple service, 4-wheel alignment, and I'm left wondering if I can even trust them to have performed the service. Based on the way they treated me I wouldn't be surprised if they had just kept my car for 3 hours and printed out the bill. Check out their reviews on yelp for specific examples of Rory's unprofessional conduct.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>TLDR; don't go here. They are rude if you don't play their game.

My wife and I made an appointment to see a specific car that was supposed to be at the lot. We get there and no one knows about this car. It was never there and never had been there. They look into getting it transferred over and set us up to do the credit check, etc. No big. We wanted to buy and thought the deal was ok. So then fully expected us to sign for this car and hand over the down payment sight unseen and while they were trying to get a car to bring over. It's new, why would you need to drive it? They let us know the car would be there in 2 hours. We walked away to talk it over and look over the numbers.  We managed to find a different dealer colma that had the car in hand and could give us a better deal, went and checked it out, ended up buying. As soon as we could we let the Berkeley dealer know the deal was off. We got a better deal elsewhere. Nothing personal, just business. I spoke to the salesman first. He scoffed at me when I thanked him for his time. And then another person called from the dealership and decided to start yelling at me over the phone and trying to guilt trip me over the phone. I honestly did not listen to half of what he said, but I made it clear that it was unprofessional and rude and to not call me again. All of there numbers have been blocked and I will be calling customer service to report this aggravated harassment.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

-PREVIOUSLY: This place used to be very toxic due to someone named Rory. He is a racist misogynist pile of horrible excuse for a human. He should be flagged and NEVER allowed to work with people or anything safety related ever again. (He is the quintessential example of the most ignorant entitled white straight male.)
-Rory was fired. (Finally someone there got a back bone.) The company had to know he was clearly worthless and the hire ups in honda should have fired him from day one. I'm looking at you, who ever hired him and kept him    p r o t e c t e d   from repercussions for so long, that person  should be fired as well.
-I had direct safety problems because of Rory; and he was just mean.
(I had to keep going back there because they were the closest and the Honda of Oakland is creepy. Never ride a shuttle at honda of Oakland...but that is a different review.)

-NOW: the people are much nicer and the customer service is great. Tom, Kevin, Jamayo, and Amairani (yes, I called them to get the spelling correct because they are that nice and engaging) they communicate well, and keep a happy demeanor. It is incredible how much can change when they one very toxic person is removed.
-I will continue to go back there with my car needs. VERY HAPPY with the treatment there.

****If Rory ever gets hired back I will change this review and report them the the BBB and the papers. Rory was horrifically rude, demeaning, and put me in harms way. He was LYING to people about their cars and the safety of their cars. RORY DIMICK is his full name, taken from a prior business card he gave me. If you are reading this and thinking about hiring him. Do not, unless you are wanting to hire someone for a neo nazi cult, in that case he is your man.****<//Text>

The service and parts here is terrible. After going here several years, finally have to go elsewhere after a history of being overcharged and told that I needed unnecessary repairs. The last straw was bringing in my 2001 accord for a routine oil change and being told that I needed the timing belt repaired because there were 'cracks'. I declined, and while waiting for service, I looked up on my personal spreadsheet of former repairs and saw that this repair was done 3 years / 20k miles ago at a different honda center (the $800 repair is supposed to be every 10 years or 100k miles). After telling the service rep this, he "talked with the mechanic" and then said that I didn't actually need the service because the cracks were parallel and not diagonal. What a load of BS. I started going here because I used to think it was best to go to the dealer to get repairs done. But I just can't bring myself to go here again after that. They also charge significantly more than they should for most repairs. I'm glad to be done paying too much for unnecessary service.

Update: I took my car to a different service place (an honest one) and found the rear breaks were 4mm, even though they had been replaced less than three months prior, at berkeley honda. The dishonest berkley honda service must have used the cheapest break pads in existence, solidifying them as ABSOLUTELY DISHONEST.</Text>

<review>I ordered their food thru Chowbus. After half way of eating their phos, I suddenly find a fly in the soup. Terribly disgusted and contacted customer service. Their reply still emphasize how clean their kitchen is and the fly never exists in their space, neither say sorry or feel regreted. Well that makes me certain there won't be any substantial improvement in their food cleaniness. Sure I won't order anymore, but also want to let more people know.<//review>< Rating>

Tiny, but clean. New furniture and comfortable dining room. Noodles are pretty good and good amount too. Cash only is not very convenient.<//Text>

Seems like they might have changed chef and ingredients. For example the deep fried fish with tomato sauce is becoming frozen fish< /text>

If you have been to the one in Oakland, you can tell this place is one grade down in term of taste and service. The noodle has less flavor and staff attitude really kills you from coming here again. Cash only is also something nobody likes. The food came quick but overall experience wasn't great.<//Review>

The noodle is okay, but not really impressed me.

Not so much meat within the noodle.

The service is not good. There’s only one waitress in the house. Normally, she won’t pay attention to you.</text>< Pictures>

Came here with a friend and was excited because I've been really digging the Chinese Noodle Soup places which offer a wholly different flavor than the classic Viet soups I am used to. When I came in, the ordering is done on an iPad attached to a stand and the menu was initially being displayed in Chinese.  Thankfully, there was an English button option and once finished, the waiter comes and takes the tablet.  I chose a pork soup and there were 2 sizes to choose from, and 3 kinds of noodle.  These were thin. rice, and Pho which I thought was odd since at least 2 of these are rice noodles.  I wanted wide and flat so I went with Pho and my friend ordered thin.  When the soups came out I was surprised to see that the Pho was thinner than I had hoped, and her "thin" noodles looked a lot like Bun Bo Hue noodles which are actually thicker and round.  Go figure.  The soup had an interesting flavor that was what I would call notably Chinese.  No idea how to explain it other than that.  The broth was very salty.  My friend and I have a running joke where she never drinks the noodle soup broth and I always do, but this was so salty, she had to order some hot water on the side to dilute it and recommended I do the same.  I initially wanted to pass, but decided I had better.  Now, if you love salty broth, this is probably the saltiest I have ever tasted anywhere.  Not going to say if it is good or bad, but i twas not to my preference and the additional hot water made it edible, and I could not even really drink the soup at all.  The flavor was fine, and memorable, but I found myself just trying to finish to get through the saltiness.  I don't think I would come back unless I was with someone who wanted to try it, in which case I would not necessarily decline, but I would warn them about the saltiness and I would look for a non soup dish my next round.   This is not a bad place, I just felt the soup I ordered was more of a challenge than it was a meal I could enjoy.</review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Good food and large portion for adults. Price is fair ($11 to $14) . Rice noodles are chewy and enough meats per serving (more meat than regular Japanese ramen). Rice noodles can be served in soup or dry.
The place is brand new and clean. Customers can order through store order system on iPad. Servers are friendly although it's more like self servicing place. Do note that the place is cash only.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

From our initial consultation through installation, Rowland Air offered us first class service. Everyone we dealt with was kind, knowledgeable, and competent. Our new top of the line AC system is whisper quiet and extremely efficient. Like other businesses during this pandemic, they have had to wait for equipment. I can assure you that we’re glad we waited.</Text>

Our A/C system quit providing cool air and shutdown on a typical 111 deg day.  Technician Gabriel P. provided a comprehensive assessment of our A/C system problem and explained the steps he was performing to accomplish this task.  All the pressure and electrical readings proved to be in their proper zones.  He explained the new systems are more sensitive than past technology.  In the end, our problem was fixed by replacing the filters and cleaning the condenser coils.  With those tasks accomplished, the system was placed on line and is back to working perfectly.</Text>

Rowland Air Conditioning did an amazing job getting us a brand new system! Eric Haymann came out, seen that our unit was done. He worked hard and got a very professional crew together the very next day! We are grateful for everyone that worked very professionally to make sure everything ran well. And we are comfortable in this Heat wave! I highly recommend this company!!< /text>

After seeing my previous review I did receive a call saying they would refund the service fee. Fantastic! Glad to know they take their reviews to heart and listen to the feedback. Theyve got my business!

I’ve used Rowland many times in the past and been happy so when our AC went out I called them right away. Made the appointment over the phone on a Saturday afternoon and was told the soonest they could get out would be Thursday. Repair man comes and gives an estimate which included a service fee. I asked about it and the technician explained it was unwaiverable. I questioned why I wasn’t told when I made the appointment; he claimed I should have been. I would never have gone w this company had I known this. It’s always been a fee that is absorbed once the work is agreed upon. Poor business practice.</text>< pics>

If you want a new system, or a repair on your old system, Roland does it all, and they do it very well. They are very professional, with specialists who handle design, parts ordering, scheduling, financing, and installation. They aren’t the cheapest around, but we appreciated that there is a whole team involved, along with a physical location, and they know what they are doing.

We purchased a new 5 ton Lennox dual zoned unit last fall that we have been very happy with. We later had them install a high quality air scrubber to add to the dust/virus filtration system present in the Lennox unit. They also upgraded all our ducting for energy conservation and efficiency, and they did a fantastic job. Unfortunately we had a power surge this month that seriously damaged the 9 month old unit. Unbelievably, surge protectors don’t automatically come with HVAC systems. Do yourself a favor and pay a few hundred dollars extra for HVAC surge protectors! We were lucky that we were still under warranty or we would have been out MAJOR money.

We’ve had quite a few employees here, and we have been happy with all of them. They all wore masks and booties and cleaned up after themselves.

My only complaint about Roland is the wait time. This happens with popular businesses, but I feel the waits were excessive- especially for an established customer. It took 3 trips total to repair our unit, which I expected due to parts, but lengthy waits after parts have arrived is excessive, in my opinion, once a repair has been started.

The surge damaged our unit on July 1, and the repair was completed on July 16, but the original completion date was July 20- which would have been 6 days after they received the last part. Almost all of those days were triple digit temps, which led to me becoming ill when the outside temp reached 116°, so they amended the completion date to 2 days after receiving the last part, which was a more reasonable time frame. We purchased a very expensive unit from Roland and also purchased a service contract. We expected much better response times.

Despite my issue with response times, I still recommend this business. Their skill and knowledge is apparent, and I have experienced far too many HVAC technicians who did not have those skills.</Review>

<review>Rowland installed new heating and air con systems in both my home and rental unit in the past few years. Excellent service both places.

Today June 21,2021 serviceman Eric Heymann installed an air scrubber to my home system to filter the air after having had awful air during extended fires and generally bad air quality in the valley. I  recommend Rowland highly and have referred them to several friends who have been equally impressed and satisfied with this company. So nice to have a terrific company that still values professionalism and great customer service.</review>< Date>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Horrible reliably. Numerous service appointments made and confirmed by THEM and "always saying it was supposed to be tomorrow" and never showing up. 4 times! No more!

Update, so someone did just show up. That's great, they do try and got it done. So as long as ending is OK, I'm ok. Much thanks for the effort! Change back to a5 which is what they are! My apologies🙏<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Robert at Rowland Air took very good care of us during our estimate process, explaining a lot.  Santa Clarita is about 10 degrees difference than Los Angeles, and there are many good, reputable air & heating companies in the area, but we had a good feeling with Robert’s step-by-step explanations of products and warranties, our location, and the ability for our existing ductwork to work with the new system.  One-Day install of ac unit and furnace-coil.  We are very satisfied with the outcome.< /Text>< rate>

He was able to almost immediately fix this situation and had me up and running and saved me thousands of dollars.

The inspector Chris did very great job and he is very professional, worked until very late in the night and gave us a number of solutions so that we can choose the best one for us. More importantly, they help and prioritized my installation in the shortest waiting time under 100+ F heat wave week<//Review>

<Text>Very Very Happy with this company.  After the heater went out they responded swiftly and gave us an estimate with no hidden nonsense.  In Fact, we were informed the licensed Lennox business who installed the air conditioner a few years ago never pulled the permits and cut all kinds of corners.  They corrected all the issues and we are toasty warm.
Very Very Grateful for the company and Brett’s professionalism.< /Text></record>

Gabe was thorough in explaining what he would during the AC service inspection and described the condition of the unit upon completion of the maintenance check.

<review>I originally had Rowland Air Conditioning install a new Unit and once we had the unit installed two of my neighbors had units installed also. They are very reasonable and I knew that they would get the job done. I am so thankful that I called for help..thanks so much Kathy 🙏 💓 ☺<//review>< pics>

The Rowland Air team was exemplary in every possible way, skilled, friendly, and professional. Jeffrey, Thomas and David worked long and hard to ensure my new HVAC system was installed perfectly. Could not be more pleased with the quality of my new Lennox equipment and the excellence of Rowland Air's technicians and service.<//review>

Obviously Rowland is a very busy business as they have a lot of 5 star reviews on yelp however I would have say 3.5 stars. They arrived after my scheduled 3 hour block and then when choosing an emailed receipt for services, got their covid policy instead?  The tech was nice and thorough but obviously rushed since he arrived late<//review>

Rowland is amazing to work with, my team included Israel, Curtis, Derrick, Alano (there are a couple of names I don’t remember).  They were professional, polite, friendly and very easy to work with.  The quality of their work and their attention to detail was excellent.  I would immediately choose Rowland for any other HVAC work in the future!!!!<//Text>

<review>I'm not exactly sure how I came across these guys but I am glad I did. They designed my HVAC system and have been maintaining it since. Couldn't be happier with the service and professionalism of these guys. If there was one negative it would be that their techs tend yo try to upsell and you don't want that from them. Let the office try to bring in more business. Aside from that, their service is great and their prices are reasonable.</review>< pics>

<text>Rowland installed an entirely new HVAC system for me in 2018 through the Costco referral program. They did a great job and the system has performed well. I just had a service call and am about to have them install new outlet vents in several rooms not well served by the existing ducting put in place after the Northridge earthquake.<//text>< Rating>

Excellent service. Company fit me in the day after I called, I received a phone call 30 minutes before he arrived (just as they said I would), and the tech was knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. He put covers on his shoes before he walked on our carpet. The cost of the service was less than I thought it would be. A++ service.< /review>

<Review>Eric worked on my call. Prompt and professional.  Advised me on needs and current AC
status along with all options available.

Replaced thermostat, filter and recharged our unit in a very efficient
way. These guys are top shelf...
I signed up for the yearly maintenance ,that's how confident
I feel about this company.
Rowland, better yet, Eric thanks for your prompt and efficient
Work.

<Text>Truthful honest are the words I would use. I am power guy and want the best of the best. But Eric walk me through the Equipment and explain to me how it all works and getting a new system wasn’t  the Most efficient way and we are able to fix my current system that will not break my piggy bank. Great company always going use them in the future.<//Text><username>Pat Stone<//username>< Time>

That was on a Thursday. That weekend we went through a heatwave—105/112. Praise the Lord—Robert sent us a team of 3 great guys installed our a/c on Monday. They did a great job. I would recommend Rowland and Lennox air conditioning any day!<//text>< Pics>

Dear Mr. Rowland,

I am customer of your company since March 2019, when I had my AC system, furnace, and ducting done. I went through Lowe's and spent over $11,000 for overhauling the whole system. Your guys did a great job and we were very pleased with the install.

However, 1 year and 5 months later, my AC system goes out and here's where things have just gone downhill. A technician from Rowland Air came out and did a leak test and found the coil in the attic had been leaking. I was informed the part was under warranty but the labor had expired after 1 year. The cost to replace the coil would be $1600. Not only that, the cost to have done the leak inspection was $323. I paid the $323 and requested the part to be reordered under warranty.

From that point, I contacted Lowe's and all they managed to do was contact Rowland Air and have the $323 I already paid deducted from the $1600. I think this is standard business practice whether it's a car repair or home repair to absorb the cost of the initial inspection as part of the labor cost for repair/replacement, so it really didn't seem like they did anything. Lowe's then advised me to contact Lennox, who was the manufacturer of this AC system, to see what they could do to help with the labor costs.

I went ahead and contacted Lennox waiting on hold for over an hour and finally when I spoke to someone, I was told the part was made by a sister company, ADP, and was directed to call them. I called ADP and left a voicemail and heard back a few days later saying they could not do anything for labor. I reached out to Lowe's again and have basically been told there is nothing more they can do.

I called Rowland Air's office this past Saturday and vented my frustration with this lack of customer service. I felt that I shouldn't be the one having to call around everywhere and it should be Rowland Air that provides customer service to me as their customer. I was told no one from management was available and she'd take a message and get back to me. Today is Wednesday night and I have yet to receive any callback from your office.

At this point, I have the coil replacement scheduled for 9/10 with Rowland Air. As much as I hate to do this and leave a bad review (which I rarely do), there seems to be no other way to get any help in customer service from Rowland Air. How can a company with contracts from Costco and Lowe's treat their customer this way? I've spent over $11,000 just 1 year and 5 months ago and I'm left to pay this $1600 out of my own pocket? That's not what customer service is about. The reason I went with Lowe's and Rowland Air was because I thought if I ran into a situation like this, there would be excellent customer service willing and ready to take care of me. Instead, I'm left disappointed by your company's lack of service.

It's unfortunate it has come to this, but you've essentially lost me as a customer. Once I get the coil replacement done and pay another $1300 on top of the $300 I've already paid, I'll be taking my business elsewhere and will have to recommend others (family, friends, and neighbors) to do the same, because I would not anyone else to run into the same situation I'm in after paying so much money to a company to install and overhaul the whole system and be asked to pay the labor for part that broke just 1 year and 5 months (probably earlier since it was a leak).

I don't know if I will even get a reply, but as I've said, I feel like I have no other options left.</text>

Roland's team did an excellent job on the installation of my new central air and heating. They were well organized, clean, efficient,  respectful and thoughtful. I expected a lot of noise and chaos but I hardly knew they were here. My new unit is operating perfectly.  I would highly recommend them.<//review>

Rowland Air did an amazing job on our HVAC system, from start to finish.  Ron did a thorough assessment and helped me understand in layman’s terms the nuances of how the heat/cool system works.  This tutorial is much appreciated for the customer to know what is being done and what’s best for the household needs.  He provided full explanation of the options and discounts.

Our old system was older than 40 yrs and with old ducts, installation was planned for 2 days. The installation crew so efficient and completed the job in 1 day!! Kudos to Edward, Derek, Matt, Nick, Alano, and Curtis!!  They were timely, explained all changes, polite, and cleaned up afterwards.  I was very impressed by Edward and his team’s professionalism.  We love our new HVAC. The process was smooth and I highly recommend them!!!< /text>

Giovanni was personable and professional.  He quickly diagnosed that we were low on coolant, likely due to a leak, and added more to our system.  We have an old A/C system, so I was pleased that he wasn’t a salesman just trying to sell us a new unit!</Text>

<Review>My thermostat was replaced last summer. I did not use the heater till this winter. Much to my surprise I had no heat. I called Rowland Air Inc to have a look as to what the problem might be. The company that installed the thermostat broke it upon installing it, and said nothing. Eric from Rowland’s was professional and knowledgeable. Once I explained the situation he went right to the thermostat and replaced the backplate that was broken. The problem was fixed in a very short time. Warm air ahhh!

I was able to get a next day appointment.  The tech, called 30 minutes before he arrived , was on time, explained why we were having the problem, and what it would cost to repair.   He then answered all our questions, helped us register with total connect comfort, and showed us how to use the app.  We appreciate how quickly we were able to get an appointment and how well the job was done.< /review>

The Rowland team was truly excellent on all levels. My home’s AC unit died over a holiday weekend and they were able to quickly assess the situation and work to have a new unit installed immediately. From their responsiveness to care and professionalism, I would recommend Rowland to anyone in need of AC repairs or installation.< /Review>

I reached out to the manager to reverse the duplicate charge but to no avail after calling twice. Secondly, labor is charged for every part they replace which is unheard of. The part is worth $30 which we ordered but did not come on time for the appointment but I was billed a ridiculous amount.

Thank you  Rowland Air. Very happy with your service and especially Jesus, the technician. We especially like to see the same technician(s) who come over the year(s) for maintenance.  We know they “know” our HVAC systems and our house and we appreciate them.< /Review>

All the employees that I interacted with were professional and kind. The installers were great, very clean and easy to work with. Jeff, Evan, Thomas, Raphael, and Scott. If you need a new system or maintenance this is a great company to hire.<//Review>

I am happy with the service Rowland air delivered so far.  Ron is my sales manager, he is very patient and professional all the way through the process.  He attentively listened and answered my question about the unit, installation, financing.....all sorts of questions.  He delivered the best customer service.  That helped me to make the decision to choose Rowland air.  The installation cruise is awesome, friendly, give me option and provide professional guideline to make decisions during the installation.  After the installation, they clean up the site neatly.   I also want to say thank you to the ladies helped me with appointment.  I can see their smile face over the phone.   JOB WELl DONE.  Next will be getting  permit and rebate,  I hope the transaction will be smooth with Rowland air’s help.  Thank you so much.<//Text>

He answered all of our questions and gave us additional information about the Service Agreement. He was courteous and helpful.< /Text>

So they called me up for a service call and I said why not.where I thought they were going to do a service check on both my heating and air conditioning units, it turned out that the special was only for one, the heater. I had him do both and paid the extra money. Rick was we real good and updated my systems and told me what I was going to need to get done and showed me why and it was a worthwhile education. I like the fact that he was honest, which exemplifies the entire company. I was very happy with the results. And it appears in a couple months he will have to come back and update part of my heating unit and keep me healthy. I recommend them.<//text>< response>

I have had a Great Experience with Rowland when, purchasing both Heating & Air Conditioning units.  It continued with the installation, and today, with a service call by Technician Rick Caron.  As I am a senior (81), I especially appreciate Rick's patience in explaining his "expertise" and knowledge so that I may better understand the process of the  problem.  Rick called me twice to let me know when he was on his way, so I knew when I could expect him.  I applaud him, and also, for the "Great Customer Service" from the entire Rowland staff!<//Review>

This company is the best!
From beginning to end, the professionalism and knowledge shown during the installation and to today’s maintenance is outstanding.
These folks care about what they are doing.
So happy I stopped at the Costco display.
I still stop and tell the reps and any potential customer just how pleased I am with Rowland Air and the product.

< Review>
From our initial visit with Brett guiding us in designing an HVAC plan that fulfilled our needs to the completion of the job, we were impressed with the professionalism and friendliness of each member of Rowland Air.  It wasn't a simple replacement; we needed some expert engineering that required additional ductwork and additional vents.  Kelly was always friendly and efficient on the phone, calling us with reminders and handling scheduling.  Cesar came out and did a complete walk-through and made sure we had a complete understanding of what our home needed to upgrade our system and save us money.  When installation day arrived, Edward, Nick, Rafa, Izzy, and Marcos showed up with three trucks.  Each member of the team was professional, polite, and they worked very well together.  They worked happily, singing and playing music that was uplifting to all of us.  They were friendly and involved us in each step.  They took care to be clean and showed that they cared about the job they did. The installation was quick, efficient, and top quality.  They took time to show us how to use our new equipment and made sure we were comfortable with using it before leaving.  We would not hesitate to recommend Rowland Air to anyone!< /Review>

Gerardo very knowledgeable and very respectful. I liked that he checked my air conditioner and fixed what needed to get fixed right before summer.  Will be calling them again for future maintenance of my Residential air conditioner.< /Text>

I had an early morning AC service call appt which I missed because I didn’t hear the doorbell when the Tech arrived. I called the office and they moved mountains to reschedule me for later in the day. When the Tech, Jesus M. arrived, he was well covered up, head to toe, in compliance with Covid-19 guidelines. He inspected and correctly diagnosed the problem, serviced my AC and made recommendations re draining the pipe lines. I couldn’t be happier with the excellent & professional service from Rowland Air, at par with my past experiences. BTW, Rowland Air installed my new AC system 3 years ago and they always provide excellent service to me.</Text>

I will definitely communicate all this information to our team.  Please do not hesitate to contact us in the future should you have any questions or concerns.  Thank you for choosing Rowland Air!'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c289acaf127ce3:0x30f7059f0b8ea55b<//Gmap_id><Text>I’m very pleased to share my review and personal experience with Rowland Air.   I was searching for a new HVAC/Furnace for my single family home in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles.

My extensive research of many local heating and air companies in my area, eventually led me to COSTCO.

I filled out an online form, and shortly thereafter, was contacted by Rowland Air.   They scheduled an in home appointment that was convenient for me, and as we’re in the middle of a global pandemic and local “social distancing” order, the Sales Rep contacted me in advance of his arrival and informed me of their enhanced safety procedures.   He arrived on time, wearing a protective mask, gloves, and protective shoe covering.

He fully explained all of the available options and products, and I selected a furnace a/c combo unit.   As an additional service, Rowland also replaced and installed new smoke and carbon monoxide detectors throughout my home, after noticing that my current ones did not adhere to recently updated local safety codes.

They also explained and identified several rebates that were available, through my local utility, as well as certain state and federal tax credits.   On top of that, I also received a significant discount and incentive from COSTCO.

We then scheduled the installation.    The process from initial contact to this point, for me, was about 2 weeks.

My installation date was scheduled for 06-04-2020.    My installation team (Curtis, Jeff, Thomas & Alano) arrived at 8:15am.   (15 minutes before the scheduled time of 8:30)

They proceeded to explain every detail of how the day would go.    They showed me all the inventory items, and went through each step.   These install guys were AMAZINGLY FANTASTIC!    Ultra professional, all had masks and every protective item, just as the sales rep had)

They respected my home, and all it’s contents.    They removed all the old equipment, went up in the attic, checked all the ducts, drop cloths everywhere.   I was surprised pleasantly that trough out the entire  day, they had great communication with me.   I asked a LOT of questions!    Some questions I asked twice....and all 4 guys on my install team were incredibly patient and respectful.

The installation was completed by about 4:30pm that day, with a lunch break in between.

The last step was a very thorough recap and briefing of everything they did.    I was provided all the documentation, precise locations, and even details on how to operate my new equipment.    I was particularly impressed that this entire installation team worked VERY well together, and with me throughout the entire day.

As an ultra meticulous business management professional, and small business owner, I have a tendency to have very high expectations when I am in the role of the client.    These 4 guys....throughout this day....not only met my high expectations, but EXCEEDED them!

Note to Rowland Air management.....
I’d love for you to share this review and give a HUGE pat on the back...to,
CURTIS
JEFF
THOMAS
ALANO

THESE 4 guys are the ones who solidified a lifelong relationship with THIS particular client.
I have no doubt that all of your employees are at this same high quality standard of professionalism.... but this is a case, in my humble opinion, where I think it’s the right time to tell you, and other prospective clients, about these specific employees.    I strongly feel they deserve a little extra recognition for a job VERY WELL DONE!

So....don’t be surprised if future clients say to you.....  we want Curtis,  Jeff, Thomas, and Alano to do our install!

I also hope this review will be helpful to others.   There’s a LOT of choices that people have, and this is a very major item for every homeowner.    And it’s generally an item that most homeowners will only do once.

In this case, I’m very happy and pleased that I chose COSTCO, and Rowland Air, and will certainly ENTHUSIASTICALLY RECOMMEND both companies to my colleagues, clients, and friends.</Text>< date>

<Text>Very happy with the service and installation of my new air conditioner by Rowland Air. Brett, the Sales Rep explained what was needed and set me up with an installation date. Brett went out of his way to make sure that the installation date worked with my day off. The installation was fast and the guys were very professional. I would highly recommend purchasing the unit from Costco who uses Rowland Air. So happy to have a cool house with new technology efficiency.<//Text>< Pics>

Estimator was very knowledgeable and thorough. Also, he was polite, considerate of removing his shoes to protect my floors and very nice. It’s too expensive for me at the moment so I kept one star behind, but that is no reflection of the gentleman that came to quote for me.<//Review>

Rowland Air is an amazing Company to do business with.  5:30 pm Friday night I find out that my 96 year old mom was cold and that her furnace had stop working.  I started calling heating companies, but all were closed.  I opened up Rowland Air’s website and saw that they were open 24 hours.  A text box opened and asked if I needed help. I text that I needed a technician to come on Saturday to service the furnace for my mom.  I was able to schedule an appointment on Saturday all by texting.  Saturday morning, earlier than expected Jesse showed up.  The problem wasn’t obvious, so Jesse spent time tracing down the components to determine what was causing the problem.  He was able to find the problem and correct it.  We are so thankful he took the time to check everything and found the problem.  He explained everything to me over the phone what he did and what he found.  Jesse was very nice, polite and a good technician. Their rates are reasonable. I will not hesitate to use Rowland Air again and share with my friends what a great Company to do business with.< /Text>

<Review>The other day, initially called to upgrade my WIFI thermostat. Was told no appointments available until September.  Told her to disregard. She called me today and said appointment was available in 30 minutes. She claimed tech had new thermostats with him to install and set up in my WFI. I agreed to the visit. He arrived within minutes and glanced at my thermostat and furnace. And said he could come back next week and install a new thermostat and I would need someone else to set it up to my WIFI.  He then charged me $65 for a Service Call and would charge me another $25 to install the thermostat next week. I paid him the $65 and turned down the return visit.

I wanted to update my original response.  They contacted me regarding my previous review and arranged for an immediate follow up visit.  They arrived on time, and within minutes installed my newly purchased thermostat from a different vendor, set it up to my WIFI, and after reviewing my my furnace / AC system came up with several energy saving recommendations in which we quickly noticed an increase in the efficiency of our system.  Additionally, they discounted the second service visit half of what I paid for the initial service call.  Overall, I was so pleased with their service that I gladly signed up for their yearly service contract.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This was my first time using Rowland to address an air conditioning problem.  Rowland came with several highly recommended referrals, of which, I can honestly say was a great decision to contact them for my repair.

Eric, the technician, was extremely professional and skilled in resolving the issue upon his immediate inspection.  He was upfront about what work needed to be done and the associated cost.  Needless to say, I approved all work needing to be done to correct the problem with my AC.  I couldn’t be more pleased with the service Eric provided and will definitely use Rowland on any future AC issues.

Thank you Eric and thank you ROWLAND!< /text>

Extremely unprofessional: My friend recommended COSTCO after they did his AC. We went to COSTCO for my AC and they sent Rowland Air. Robert came out to give a quote which was high. We started discussing which things to change to reduce the price. I told him what my friend paid for his unit which was the same as the unit I need. Robert said he would go back to look up my friend' job since they worked on it too through COSTCO and see how he could match it and get back to me. One week passed and no quote or contact. I called Rowland and the young lady there said she would let Robert know I'm looking for the quote. ANOTHER week passes and no contact - I call again asking for the quote and same story, she'll let Robert know. ANOTHER week passes and no contact so I call to speak to a manager to let them know I'm reporting them to COSTCO for failure to give me a quote and going on Yelp so people can know what to expect from Robert and Rowland.The manager was apologetic and asked for a chance - I finally get the quote from Robert with no apology and the quote is the same original HIGH quote I was given in the first place verbally without the discounts we discussed and without him checking my buddy's quote. It's clear he developed something personal against me- that's not how you handle business and I'll be reporting this to COSTCO consumer affairs. If COSTCO sends ROWLAND to you, now you know what service you can expect.</Review>

{'time': 1577681117187, 'text': 'Our Design Specialist, Robert met with Douglas ("DM") to prepare an estimate for Douglas\' mother\'s home.  Robert spent several hours doing a thorough analysis of the property and reviewed many different options with Douglas.  Douglas briefly showed Robert two separate estimates he received via email from other HVAC contractors and discussed the difference in price with him.  Robert explained that the contractors were proposing to install completely different equipment and their job scope was not the same. Robert explained the legal requirements of pulling a permit, the value and importance of performing a heat load calculation, properly sizing and designing the ducting system to ensure the proper heating and cooling of the home as well as the peace of mind of having high quality equipment such as Lennox and to be backed by the Costco brand.  Douglas mentioned he was referred by a friend whom had gotten the same equipment at a much lower cost through our company.  Upon further review, we discovered Douglas\' friend did in fact have a system installed by us however the equipment was not the same.  His friend lives in a condominium and Douglas\' mother lives in a single family residence which requires different equipment and a completely different scope of work.  Comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges.  Robert reached out to Douglas on several occasions to request he send the proposals to us from the other contractors that he received to review with our management team to try to price match apples to apples however we received no response due to his voicemail being full.'}<//Resp>

He also educated me about the difference in the effectiveness of various filters available for my unit and informed me about the Rowland’s annual maintenance plans and how they tie in with my manufacturer’s warranty, and he also informed me of LADWP’s free A/C Optimization Program. He took his time and checked my system 7-10x to make sure he located the problem and fixed it completely. He was very patient with my questions, and I had many. I was really pleasantly surprised with Rowland and would definitely use them again.</Text>< pictures>

They are very professional, courteous and polite. We had their technician Geraldo out here 2 times to do annual maintenance on our unit and he treated us with respect and we were well informing of what he was doing to our unit......👍👍👍👍👍!< /text>

<Review>We just had our Air Conditioning / Heating installed by Rowland (Costco).  Great company and great customer service.  Eric came to our house and explained and went over everything.  He sent out his crew the following week (Edward, Ed, Miguel and a couple of others).  They made sure to cover anything near where they worked, and cleaned up after they were done.  Very professional, and answered all questions we had on the equipment and the new thermostat.  What we loved most was that Eric checked everything and was honest about if something needed to be replaced.  Our ventilation ducts were in great shape, so he told us there was no need to replace them.  What a difference between the old unit we had compared to this new unit.  The air flow is awesome,  and much quieter!!  Couldn't of asked for anything better.  I would recommend Rowland to anyone who is looking into getting a new unit.  The process was fast and easy, and Eric and his crew were the best!!!  Five stars all the way!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Eric was very professional, I had just bought a manufactured home and the central air did not work. It was a very old unit (over 20 years old) with a rusted motor, and I figured it would need to be completely replaced. Eric spent about 2 hours testing and identifying the faulty parts on the unit. He brought the a/c back to life for 1/10 the cost of a replacement, and the a/c now works great. In my experience most vendors would push a replacement. It is nice to know that there are professionals that take pride in their work and can actually fix things. Thank you Eric and Roland Air<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1584303252475, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback and for choosing Rowland Air!'}</response>< gmapID>

Rowland stepped up their game  , or some of you Yelper’s don’t know how to rate.
From beginning to end  our experience was great.
Brett started us off , Scott took measurements.
Julio and Juan  installed a complete system including  all new ducts in the attic. All done in 2 days as agreed.  We did the Costco program.
Also all of the extra employees who came by to help were  very friendly, they said thank you and good bye.
My wife was amazed  by their friendliness.
We highly recommend Rowland.< /Text></record>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Office staff was very professional when i called to make an appointment.  Several date/time reminders were sent so as not to forget.  Christopher arrived early in the promised window and was very thorough and professional in his approach.  He assessed need, explained alternatives in detail allowing an informed decision.

In all, a very good experience. Would recommend Rowland and Christopher

The unit was installed yesterday.  The installers ( Lucas, Brian and Curtis ) arrived early in the promised window, reviewed all of the equipment and explained the installation sequence.  Tarps were laid down to keep the pathway clean.  Installation was performed quickly and all areas were cleaned up at completion.  Everything installed was reviewed and explained.

In all, this transaction was handled very professionally.  Would certainly recommend Rowland highly based on all aspects of the transaction.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Giovanni was all masked up and had booties on when he came, I had him come out to swap a capacitor but it turned out to be a fuse, he found the problem within minutes, swapped the bad parts with the new ones...the entire time showing me exactly what he was doing, explaining what the critical parts were and why you need to be really careful working with these things...Nice guy, Rowland is lucky to have him.< /review>

I’m very happy with my new AC/furnace installation. The team that removed and replaced the units did a great job. I’m looking forward to a cool summer. Rick C, also did a great job on explaining my options which helped me make the right choice. I could have chosen a different company with a lesser price, but I doubt I would have felt as confident in that choice.</review>

<review>When my family decided to update and expand our current air conditioning and heating system it was difficult to choose who to trust.  Rowland Air quickly rose to the top of our list.  The representative Chris was educated, respectful, kind and helpful.  Since the installation,  my large family have been amazed at the difference in our comfort level.  Our home was always a peaceful place but now it is peaceful and comfortable.  Even better our electric bill did not sky rocket!  Thank you Rowland Air for your relationship based business and caring attitude...< /review>< pics>

Had an issue with my HVAC called Rowland Air to see if they could help. They Sent Eric out within an hour on a Saturday morning who was extremely nice and more importantly extremely knowledgeable. I explained what the problem was and Eric didn’t rush, took his time and figured out what it was. Excellent service. Highly recommended. Will be using them in the future.< /Review>

Rowland installed my new Lennox air conditioning & heating unit under a Costco program on 5/21/2019. The technicians were professional, attentive, patient and through. They did a clean job at our home and we are very happy about their work. The new system is running like a charm. Nice job. Thanks.</Review>

I bought a new HVAC and iComfort sys. The installers Jeff, Curtis & Alandro were scheduled to arrive at 0900 and they arrived early 0800 to get set up. They were very professional and followed the CDC guide lines. Jeff explained the plan on the installation. The crew kept their work area clean. The crew used drop cloth and plastic so nothing would make a mess.All three had good personality and seem to like to work for Rowland. My wife and I were very impressed with the good quality workmanship. I would highly recommend this company.</text>

Rowland Air installed our new HVAC in our home seven years  ago and has maintained it ever since. They are very knowledgeable and professional. We highly recommend them for any heating and A/C needs you might have.

June 2021- Just had our spring maintenance  in advance of the summer heat. The technician was very thorough and knowledgeable. Things are back in tip-top shape! We really rely on Rowland Air and their team to keep us warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Great job guys!< /review>

I  have the annual maintenance service and the company is so good about calling me to say it's time for a seasonal check up. The phone staff are so friendly and helpful and making an appointment is a breeze. I had a window of 0930-1230 but got a call at 8:45 from the tech, Gerardo, to see if he could come early. YEAH! He donned his booties and went to work - checking out the furnace and then doing a quick check of the AC. He was polite and efficient. Love this company.< /review>

Thomas did a great job! He was polite and asked good questions to learn more about the problem. He figured out what was wrong quickly and gave me a cost estimate. He replaced one part (pilot light) and cleaned another (flame sensor) and tested the furnace three times to make sure it would work.
Thomas was excellent! Thanks, Jim McLaughlin</review>

<Text>Thomas H. was great.  He was friendly and professional. He explained the issue clearly and fixed our heater right away.   He recommended and explained various maintenance options in a way that didn't feel pressuring but sounded like a good idea; we didn't have time today but will probably call them back and get a maintenance contract. I wish more repair men were like him.  When we call back I'll ask for him personally, but if he isn't available this visit made us like the company in general enough to trust whoever else they send out.</Text>< username>

I was very happy with the technicians that came out to trouble shoot my system. They actually came earlier than scheduled, which was great since my AC system had been out for 3 days.  After about 10 minutes, they found the problem and fixed it. Instant air! I couldn't be more happy with the technicians and Rowland Air. Great company and service!

<text>Rowland Air Conditioning and Heating did an excellent job installing our Takagi Tankless Water Heater.  Jeff and Arlan's plumbing workmanship was first rate.  Cesar cut an inlet vent hole in our tile roof and even had red paint for the vent pipe and flashing.  It rained last night and the vents didn't leak a drop.  Our previous installation leaked for years.  Takagi provides perfect temperature control for our shower.< /text>< rating>

Excellent job, the guys were professional, fast and efficient. We’ve had the unit for 2 days and can’t believe how quiet it is. House heated up pretty fast and it got so warm we had to turn settings lower compared to old unit.  Thank you Rowland and Thank you Costco for the promotion and savings 😉🤗.  Can’t wait to get our gas and electric bills.<//review>

We'd been without our heater since last winter, we had obtained a quote from the company who installed our system (now bankrupt) and were displeased with the "well it could be this, or this and maybe this" mystery quote. We decided to tough it out and look for another company to do business with. Rowland came highly recommended by a friend and we used them to repair our A/C this July when during during the 100+ heatwave it decided to quit. Our technician was honest and quick, and we decided to get a quote from them once fall rolled around. They came and gave us a quote for repair but we also wanted to explore new. Enter Chris M. This gentleman was very knowledgeable, highly professional and honest with his quotes and explained our options in detail. After taking the time to consider our options we decided to go with a new system, Chris returned promptly and we completed all paperwork which was carefully explained. Very pleased with the experience and would recommend to others.< /Text>

Always very pleased with the service.  I had a leak with my air conditioner and assumed it was a clogged pipe.  Jesse confirmed that it was.  He provided options for me to chose from and I opted for the clog repair, installation of a shut off switch and overall a/c service.  The PVC turned out to be very thin (not surprised as Sears did the original installation), so we decided to replace the PVC instead of clearing the clog.  While the work took some time, Jesse was very professional keeping me updated as he went and explaining how the switch worked once it was installed.  You have provided service to me many times (usually with Eric) and I am always pleased with the results.  I fell behind in my regular maintenance; I won''t let that happen again.<//Review>

<time>1553292246735</time><pictures>None< /pictures><text>Eric Heyman serviced my equipment to today. He was very professional and friendly.. He assured me that it will keep me cool for the summer.

He discovered a leak. He informed me that the coil needed to be replaced and it was under warranty, however, the labor will be $2200.. My air conditioner has been a problem since it was installed.  Always the same thing—a leak..

I was upset, so I was offered to replace the system for $3700... this time it will be a different system and parts warranty 10 years and 1 year labor...

It’s a reoccurring nightmare... I can pay the high labor cost of $2200 or a placement the air conditioner for $3700 sounds like the same offer when I chose to get your system before...

I am disappointed, because I thought I was getting quality equipment and service.< /text><gmapID>0x80c289acaf127ce3:0x30f7059f0b8ea55b</gmapID><user_id>108180779320633295578<//user_id>< Name>

<text>I signed up for an air conditioner service appointment through the Lancaster, CA Costco about two weeks ago.  Rick was the technician that was assigned to my job.  He arrived on time and provided a thorough check and service of my system.  What made the service call even better was that he explained everything he was doing and gave me an excellent overview of the components of my system and how they were operating/should be operating.  You don't normally get this kind of in-depth tutorial from any type of service call.  Turns out I only needed some minor tweaks.  Rick did an awesome job.  He was incredibly friendly, informative, and professional. I would highly recommend him and Rowland Air....in fact, I already have.  He came out to check on my grandmother's system last night.<//text>< pictures>

Eric called me to let me know he was on his way. I met him at my house, politely greeted me and asked a few important questions pertaining to my ac unit. After checking things out he found that my freon was very low.
We agreed to recharge the system with freon, afterwards checked the inside temperature which was at 24 degrees. Eric also explained that after the 1st of the year, California laws are changing on replacing complete units.
Before he left he had put together an estimate for for replacing my old unit, plus if I were to have it done he would credit this visit and the last visit towards it. Both Eric and Thomas are very professional and courteous.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Tricia and Scott were awesome!  Tricia was very friendly and empathetic to my problem.  She assisted me from the office in every possible way and quickly scheduled me a technician to come to my home.  Scott arrived at our home prompt, friendly, and with a great sense of humor, which is  a plus!  Both were very knowledgeable and addressed my heater malfunction with a speedy resolution.  I highly recommend this company - I have never been disappointed!  Thanks guys!< /text>

<Review>I would recommend Rowland Air to everyone. The technician show up when he said he would. Listened to what we thought was wrong. Which lead him to fix our furnace in less than a 1/2 hour. He also let us know that we would need to be replacing a part in the near future and that cost. Politely offered their warranty program. He was very professional and so nice. We will definitely be calling Rowland Air to make our future repairs.</Review></record>

<Review>The techs at Rowland Air have just become my new heroes!  After my air conditioning unit took its last breath, Eric H. came down to explain all my options and answered all my questions.  After an installation date was given, he was able to get the date bumped up, and within 72 hours the new unit was up and running.  Can’t say enough about his team, Ray and Marcos, who after the work was complete, ensured that everything was cleaned up and back to normal.  They will definitely be my number one referral for anyone looking for heating or air conditioning services.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1602368081340, 'text': 'Thank you for choosing Rowland Air and for taking the time to leave your feedback!'}</resp>< gmapID>

Thomas is a gentleman. Extraordinarily polite as well as freely offering up when something was beyond his knowledge (his knowledge being excellent to begin with.)

I would recommend asking for him by name.

As to Rowland Air and others - this is the kind of person you should be proud of (and reward) his excellence.<//Review>

I have my AC system serviced by Rowland Air yearly.  This was the first time Jesse serviced my system. Jesse arrived on time and was very professional for the outset.  He explained exactly what he planned to do to my system and went right to work.  I saw that his work habits were neat and methodical and he explained his findings throughout the service.  He discovered some minor issues with my system and provided recommendations.  He was pleasant and approachable as he answered my questions without hesitation.  Overall great experience.<//Text>

They are very thorough and practical. As a customer, I appreciate the fact that they are recommending me something that they would do for their own home rather than simply suggesting a complete overhaul of my AC and furnace system because I wouldn’t know any better.
I definitely recommend Rowland Air if you need your AC looked at and repaired!< /text>< pics>

Installation staff was very professional and answered our questions during the installation.  Brett was available for any additional questions we had.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Our heater went out. After getting other quotes we decided to use a company who installed Costco products. The Sales Rep secured a next day installation, my mother will be 95 this year and does not do well with the cold. The installers were in and out and cleaned up after themselves and very professional. It is so nice to not wear a coat in the house. Thank you for taking care of us so quickly.

Rowland Air showed up on time with the necessary equipment and crew to complete the system installation promptly.  We were extremely happy with the workers, who were careful not to leave a mess in the house or outside.  They replaced the air conditioning & heating units and installed all new duct work.  The price was very competitive as we had multiple bids.  We now have an energy efficient, really quiet system that keeps us warm in the winter and cool in the summer.  We have already recommended Rowland Air to our friends and will continue to do so in the future.</Review>

Eric came out as part of the LADWP Optimization Plan. He was polite, knowledgeable,  and patient. Everything you would want in a service tech. He explained everything he was doing and allowed to do under the plan. He has been with Rowland Air over 15 years and explained that it was a family run business. He knew the model of our air conditioner very well and although it is still quite new, he said we were using the wrong filter. While everything else checked out great I would love to have Eric as our maintenance guy going forward. He cared about his work and his customers.</text>

Rick came out and spent 4 hours with my wife and myself.  He detailed every step of our new A/C and Heating system.  He was very specific about the costs, installation, warranty and follow up service.  His detail made it easy for us to decide to go with Costco/Rowland Air.  The system is working great, can hardly wait to see the energy savings.  The installation technicians sent out here by Rick were very professional and detailed as well as personable.   We are very happy and would recommend Rick and his company anytime.<//text>

<text>We called Rowland Air because they’ve taken care of us since they installed our house system in 2010.  Today, Jesse Mora came to assess an issue with our cooling system that our recent twice yearly maintenance visit failed to detect (by a poor technician we prefer not to use, but was the only person available). Jesse spent 1 1/2 hrs here, detailing every step he took, educating us and giving superb, patient care to each step. After rigorous detective work, Jesse decided adding coolant was the mostly likely help for our concerns. Immediately, we felt a pronounced difference in air temperature and thrust.  We were told that there may be a slow leak somewhere in our lines from outside to our unit inside, we’re given pricing for the issue to be assessed, and NO SALES PITCH to pressure us to do anything now. Jesse was on time, courteous, and we highly recommend him. Also, we got an appointment set for within 3 hours of our call! We do have a maintenance contract with Rowland Air which helps with discounts, preferred appointments and we suggest having one if you like the service!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Jesus Mora, the excellent Service Technician: arrived on time; wore booties on his shoes to keep my white carpets clean; diagnosed the problem with my air conditioning system; and was very polite. The problem was not with the thermostat, as I had thought, but with the circuit board on the machine in the attic (plus one other part on that machine).  He has the circuit board on order and will return in one or two days, as soon as the parts arrive, and install them.  He had to go up and down my 16 steps to where I live, plus his ladder steps to the attic dozens of times and never complained at all. What a great person to work with!</Review>

<Review>Highly recommend Rowland Air. My A/C unit broke in the middle of summer and Rowland Air replaced it within a couple of weeks. Brett took his time to break down everything that I would need and inspected everything necessary before giving me a quote. While waiting for install Brett also provided me a portable A/C unit. Mario, Rolando and Edward installed my Lennox A/C unit in a timely manner, while performing quality work.< /Review>< userid>

<Text>For the past two years, Rowland Air has been our go-to company for our heating and air conditioning needs.  Their knowledge and honesty has been displayed throughout the time of service and installation of our equipment.  Service tech Rick was very helpful in our choice of a badly needed heating replacement to go with our recent air conditioning unit which we purchased roughly two years ago.  I highly recommend Rowland Air (that's R-O-W-L-A-N-D, because there are similar named heating and air conditioning companies out there.  Make sure you get the right one!)  Rick's entire team are very helpful and friendly.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c289acaf127ce3:0x30f7059f0b8ea55b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We called these guys to fix an external AC unit in our pool house which was still under warranty.
They were quick, thorough, professional and they fixed the problem.  I would definitely use them again.  I knocked off one star for what they charged for labor which I felt was a bit steep, but as far as the quality of work I give them 5 stars.  Make sure to ask for Rick!!<//review>

Edward, Eddie, and Jesus did a great job installing our HVAC system. They were very thorough and cleaned up when finished.
John M covered everything when he came and did the estimate and the system delivered just like he said it would.
I would highly recommend Rowland Air.<//text>

I have been With Rowland Air for 12 years. Rick C. Has given us that extra 10 steps of service or went we that extra 10 miles to make sure we understand what happened to our system and what needs to be done. Rick is a very professional Man. When we put in a service call and know it is Rick coming we are so relaxed because we trust what Rick tells us he is very honest. Rick we love you , Take care The Spaeth family<//text>

Excellent. OnTime and did a great job. We’ve been using Roland Air for the past 10 years. Highly recommended. They replaced our second HVAC unit and were able to do some minor maintenance work on our existing unit as a courtesy. Much appreciated. Andrew, and his two coworkers where respectful of our property and took great care in protective covering of our floors. They were great workers and did a fantastic job. We’ll use the again.</Review>

Semi-annual routine scheduled service call done by Gerardo. Careful, efficient, professional service. Gerardo was on time, took his time to check out the entire system, change filters, do basic cleaning. He was really respectful of our home, took extra care to do neat, clean work.  Rowland Air installed our entire HVAC system in 2008. Gerardo was the best tech they've ever sent out to do our maintenance work.< /Text>

I was nervous to have a whole HVAC installation. Reviews were ugly....My entire experience was AMAZING. Rowland AC (Costco) exceeded my expectations in every way. Every phone call was taken- every question was answered. When they came onsite, their workers were professional and explained every detail - every step of the way. There were no surprises or anything unexpected. I am BEYOND happy that all was handled quickly and professionally.< /Text>

<review>This review is for Rick Caron, a Sr. Service Technician for Rowland Air, Inc.
I had the pleasure of having Rick service our central A/C. Not only was he able to fix the issue quickly but also he was very courteous and professional, and arrived on time. It turned out the issue was a stuck damper due to bad motor which blocked the air from flowing through the vents.  The damper has been left open until the motor is replaced. I was very satisfied with the work he had done. If you ever need a technician who is very knowledgeable to service your A/C, contact Rowland Air and ask for Rick.
They are qualified to service ANY make/model.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Rowland Air replaced my furnace 10 years ago and I recall being very happy with their service. So when my AC died on Friday, July 6, the record breaking day for high temperatures, I called them. Eric was able to come out the next day to inspect and advise. My old system was toast and a replacement was installed on Monday, July 9. I don't know how they pulled this off with all the calls they must have received during this heat wave, but I call this great service. My experience with Rowland Air has been nothing but terrific.< /Text><Rate>5< /Rate><Date>1531241366892</Date>< Pictures>

<text>Contacted Rowland Air with an emergency issue on a hot Saturday afternoon suggesting that there was a problem with the installation of my new HVAC system.  They sent a technician immediately and prevented what could have been a disaster.  They were able to unplug blockage in my drainage system and the technician was very friendly and recommended that we have it checked once a year.  Good job.<//text><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>Besides the workers and sales person, some of my experience with this company has not been good. After installation, that same day my A/C was not working. My house got up to 90 degrees that night. In the morning I called to get the unit checked out and I got a service window from 1-6. 6 o’clock came around and nobody called to let me know if anyone was showing up or not. I called just before six to get an update and nobody answered!! Very disappointed in how things are being handled in the middle of summer to top it off!<//text><Resp>{'time': 1564962455687, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback.

However, Rowland’s customer service needs a great deal of improvement. I had mybunit installed on July 31, and I had nothing but trouble until mid-November. I saw multiple error messages on the touch screen, and I think there was a Rowland rep at my house, trying to decipher and resolve the issue, perhaps a dozen times. Communication is severely lacking, and I was the person to initiate all the calls and subsequent appointments to get to the heart of the matter.
For the amount I paid for the unit I expect excellent customer service. Very disappointed.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< Review>
Had an amazing experience recently with Rowland air. Eric came out a few days ago to look at my system which hadn't been serviced in over 3 years. He was very quick and efficient with his other support worker identifying my needs and getting the system back to code. He called before hand, and also showed up on time based on the schedule window.

Erix was very experienced with my system and as I live in a condo, he was also very familiar with the HOA ruled. He let me know that although my system is old and could be replaced, he was more than happy to to complete the maintenance and fix a part to keep it running as long as it could.

As he didn't have the part available, he came back two days later to complete the install.

What I really liked about Eric, was not only was he friendly and knowledgeable, he also clearly communicated different options on keeping the same system, installing a new one, and the savings involved. Best part, with the year warrenty, if I opt for a new system in the future, the fix is applied to future costs.

I had a great experience and would recommend Eric and Rowland air.< /Review>

Eric Heymann and his partner arrived 1/2 an hour early to provide maintenance service for our heating unit.  He and his partner were very friendly, professional, and courteous.  They completed the job in about 10-15 minutes.  My wife Jeanny and I appreciated their professional attitudes in their work. They have a very good public relation with their customers which is hard to find nowadays.  We would highly recommend Rowland Air to anyone who needs Air Conditioning & Heating service.<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Rick and his OJT Assistant, Dave, were professional, personable and most accommodating.
They both told me what they were going to do, made recommendations to update and improve my AC/Heating elements and checked my attic duct work ... first time in over twenty years anyone had done it.
The $69 inspection, etc., became a $450+ bill ... I believe it was a purchase of value for me and brought my AC/Heating elements current.
They owe me a filter and will bring it in Nov-Dec when again scheduled for whatever maintenance may be necessary.
On a Scale of 1-10, 10 being the best ... 10!< /Review>< Pics>

Rowland Air came out to service our  HVAC. The gentleman who arrived on time was through and professional. They have kept our HVAC system working at peak performance winter, spring, summer, and fall. Everyone I have interacted with have been courteous, professional, and friendly.
I would recommend Rowland Air to anyone needing to service or replace their HVAC system.
If you are a Costco member they have some special deals.

09/19/2020

We had an issue with the AC unit on the side of the house being very noisy.  We contacted Rowland Air. Mike and Eric came out and immediately knew what the problem was. It was a defective motor and fan. They ordered the parts and Eric came out 3 days later on a Saturday and replaced them. It only took about 30 minutes and the unit is quieter tan when it was new. These people are professional, knowledgeable, reliable and friendly.

I would highly recommend them to anyone needing a new or service to an existing heating/air conditioning system.</review>< pictures>

<review>I bought a new Lennox system thru Costco which took 2 days to install.  I've decided to break down this review by groups:

Sales Guy:  He was courteous, listened to what my wife and I were looking for, provided advice and did a good job.

Installers:  They showed up within the hours provided by our appointment.  They put down drop clothes to protect our carpet from upstairs to the front door.   They did a good job cleaning up at the end of both days.  The work was done very professionally.  They pointed out important features of our new system such as where the drain line drained into one of our sinks and provided a lot of good information.   They stayed late the 2nd day until they were finished.

The company in general.  They provided a portable AC unit free of charge for our 1 night without AC (The sales guys informed us this was possible to get during the day when our system was down, but he also told us we would have AC back on at the end of the first day.  The only AC we had was the portable, so I'd have been very unhappy if this hadn't happened).

All in All, they did a great job and I was very happy.  My only negatives are as follows:
There were a couple of times over the 2 days where they left the front door open.  I never said anything about it, just closed it when this happened.  They tried to move our out door sink which is plumbed and has a drain line.  Obviously, this wasn't happening, but they pulled the drain out when attempting this.  My wife noticed that night and had to put it back in.  Finally, the text message I received the day prior to the appointment was broken into 6 parts saying "We are confirming your appointment .... Due to the high demand we must obtain a confirmation to keep it..."   I confirmed, called them to make sure I was good for both days.  If I hadn't seen the text or forgot to respond I'm not sure what would have happened.  They sent the same text for the 2nd days appointment, so would they have just not shown up?   I understand they are busy, but I really hope they follow up when there is not a response. As I had spoken to the office before the first day's appointment and to the installers at the end of the 2nd day, I didn't see the need for the 2nd days appointment confirmation text.

Once again, I'd like to emphasize all in all I WAS very happy with the job and new system though.<//review>< Pics>

Michael A was more than awesome!!! I would give him a 15 if the max was 10. Rowland Air should give him a big raise...he went over and beyond for us. In fact the whole crew Gerardo, Austyn, Marcos were all more than awesome! Complicated systems like HVAC will have problems. Scott, the installation and service manager was incredibly helpful in resolving them. My wife and I are happy campers! We would recommend Rowland Air to all of our friends and family. Thank you!

Eric came out to do the heater inspection for the coming winter. He was professional and efficient. I had a problem with the carbon monoxide detector and he said he will replace it on his next visit. Thank you Eric.</text>

I was going to be sold 10-15 thousand dollar air and heating system by a company called NEXGEN AIR. They inspected my system and said I had internal cracks in it leaking carbon Monoxide. I called Rowland Air to give me a bid. Rick from Rowland inspected the system and found nothing wrong with it.  he said there was a piece of insulation material that came loose and was suffocating the system, causing it to shut off.   I paid  120 dollars plus a couple carbon monoxide detectors and saved thousands of dollars simply because He was honest.   Thanks a lot Rick< /review>

The entire staff at Rowland Air maintained a high level of professionalism throughout our entire HVAC system upgrade, a very pleasant experience.  Our on-site lead service technical professional Rick was with us every step of the way, plus was consistently available after hours for any consultations or questions.  The entire work crew team worked cleanly and efficiently, and always courteous to our family and neighbors.  Thank you Rowland Air for a job well done!<//Review>

2019: Same heat pump, 3 years after my first review.  Heat pump quit on us one very cold night.  Called Rowland and they sent Eric and GiovannI to diagnose and fix the problem.  it was determined that the wiring (under the house) was defective.  They came back a few days later with a 3rd gentleman, Gerardo, and spent some time successfully rewiring the unit to the thermostat connection.  They were on time, polite, patient, cleaned up after themselves and answered all my questions.  They really cared that I was happy and that goes a long way with me.

2016: My heat pump was installed a year ago. When I switched the unit from Heat to Cool, I found that the unit wouldn't turn on.  I called Roland Air and they sent out a service person, Kenneth,  the very next day.  Kenneth was personable, smart and very helpful. He fixed the problem quickly, tested it in both Cool and Heat modes, and changed out the filter while he was at it, plus changed out the filter of a 2nd unit, also fixing it so I wouldn't have to wrestle with it to get it to close.  In addition, he gave me some tips to increase the unit's efficiency.  Kenneth is definitely an asset for the company.<//Review>

The rep that came to our home was helpful and knowledgeable. In explaining the details of what he recommended, he spoke in HVAC talk, but in a way that both my fiance and I could understand. Anything that did need a little extra explanation he did so in a way that satisfied our concerns.

I hold back on the 5th star because its a little silly to have to write a review before we can see our quote, let alone before agreeing to the terms and going forward with such a serious upgrade to our home.</Review>

This young man was very prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable about the repair work.  He also took care to protect my carpet by putting on footies.  I would have him back in my home again.</text>

Eric just came to our home and did the LADWP Optimization on my old Carrier unit.  He was courteous, professional, and full of answers for all of my detailed questions.  Although my 24 year old unit was functioning properly, it was only running at about 5-6 SEER.......working, but costly!
Eric took the time to talk about replacement units (details, yes!), and their rebate perks and Efficiency benefits (power cost savings)!
We will likely be calling him back for a complete inspection (attic also), to
replace the old system.
Thank you Eric for the friendly and informative service!
Cheers!

Eric came out to give me a quote for 3 mini split units for upstairs because our existing unit wasnt cooling off the upstairs.  Eric was the 5th inspector that came out he toid me he was the i spector that put in my existing unit many years ago & have been here to service the init after that Eric the inspection told me the best then to do first is the Air Ducts upstairs that would increase your air flow by at least 40%.& it did. Thanks Eric for your true & professional work. I highly recommend using g Rowland Air<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

We got a Great price from Rick on a central air unit, (Lennox).  Rick stated they'd have the job done in 2 days.  I wasn't sure that was possible, with all the duct work that needed to be done.  True to his word, in 2 days, we had a gorgeous, whisper quiet, perfectly working central unit in our home.  We've been using it about a month now, and we are ecstatic about the unit.  They installed a new heater, and 3 ton in the yard.  All electrical, duct work, and venting, We're done quickly, but more importantly, correctly, and cleanly.  When the techs left our home both days, they cleaned every speck of dust from the job.  The heater work is so clean, and beautifully done, as is the unit in the yard.  I've never seen a cleaner install.  Looking in the attic, all the duct work is neat, and properly secured, new vents look great throughout our home, wiring outside is neatly done.  Rick came by a couple times a day during the install, just to make sure we were happy with each step of the work.  I couldn't recommend a company more highly than Roland, or an adviser more friendly, knowledgeable, and professional than Rick.  Everything done as promised, with no bs. Beautiful work!<//text>

RE:  Work Performance

SHORT VERSION:
Your demo / installation team consisting of employees CURTIS, DUSTIN and BENJAMIN were EXCEPTIONAL!

LONG VERSION:
As you may be aware, on or about June 12, 2019, I met with Chris Michailov who wrote an efficient and quite acceptable work order for removing, disposing existing duct system and installation of new R8 ducting system.  Work was scheduled for July 1, 2019.

The demo / installation team consisting of CURTIS, DUSTIN and BENJAMIN arrived as scheduled on Monday, July 1, 2019.  The three of them immediately commenced working the job.

Their politeness, courtesy and work ethic are Top Drawer! Without request or solicitation I have decided to let you know that Curtis and his team were Exceptional.  Curtis displayed great leadership and kept Dustin and Benjamin on task.

My dad was an electrical contractor.  I helped him wire many residential and commercial buildings . . . it was hard work.  While still attending college I worked for a concrete contractor, first doing manual labor then eventually Fresno round end finishing . . . again, it was hard work.  Sheet metal fabrication, tearing out and replacing flex ducting during the summer is . . . you guessed it – hard work!

The temperature outdoors today, July 1, 2019, was 101degrees+ (when I glanced at our electronic outdoor thermostat at 11am).  I was perfectly comfortable with running our AC at 66degrees (Rowland installed our Ruud system some years back) to allow conditioned air to circulate the attic space while the three were busily working.

It’s not easy finding skilled, hardworking craftsmen . . . but you have three of the best in Curtis, Dustin and Benjamin.

I will hand deliver a copy of this letter to Chris Michailov when he does his walk around with me.

Thank you again for continued great service and workmanship.

Respectfully submitted,

<review>Rowland did a complete central heating and air system replacement in my home.
GREAT company !!!
I used the same company for 14 years and fired them for dishonesty and dangerous installation practices that jeopardized the safety of my family.
Rowland Air is now my go to company for all heating and Air concerns. Honest, Professional and courteous are just a few of the positive experiences I had with this company. If you are looking for a company you can trust with your families safety then call Rowland Air.
Another year of maintenance by Rowland Air. Great job as always (Oct. 2020).<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>I was so happy with my experience with Rowland Air, Inc team. The girls, Claudia and Rebecca, who answer the phone, were so sweet, professional, and answered all my initial questions about Rowland Air services.  I decided to hire them for my air conditioning problem. I was given the technician's name that same day, then I received an email with the photo of the technician; who does that? I was impressed even more.  The day of the appt. I was called by the office letting me know that my technician was on his way.  I then received a call from the technician also confirming that he would arrive soon.  Eric arrived shortly after.  He was so professional and answered all my questions regarding the air conditioning unit.  He did not try and sell me unnecessary parts or push a yearly maintenance plan.  I would call Rowland Air, Inc. for any problems in the future.  It is so hard to find a company now a days that is honest, informed, and customer service oriented; it was refreshing to receive this type of care.  If you have any problems with your unit, do not hesitate to call Rowland Air, Inc.<//Text>< pictures>

Yesterday, this company sent us a technician named Rick who efficiently, expediently and inexpensively fixed our air conditioning unit.  We are very satisfied with their services, which included a diagnostic inspection, repair of the system, checking for potential hazards to the system, explanation of the problem in lay terms and useful recommendations on how to optimize the system.  We will certainly called them back.</Text>

We recently were in need of replacing our HVAC.  After receiving three estimates, we chose Rowland Air, Inc. to replace our equipment.  The customer service we received from Rick C., including their entire staff was excellent.  The Lennox system we purchased exceeded are expectations.  We would highly recommend their services and products.  Thank you Rowland Air, Inc. and Rick C. for a job well done.< /review>

<Review>We love the service I get from RowlandAir anytime I have needed something done they have come to my home and in a very reasonable period of time everyone is always very helpful respectful of my home and knowledgeable and I really appreciate  The honesty and integrity of this organization. I had a new system installed through Costco with RowlandAir and from beginning to end they did a fantastic job I highly recommend RowlandAir to anybody that is considering a new system , or getting necessary service for the system they are keeping. I have used three different companies and RowlandAir is by far the best Lennox Dealer and service or that I have come across.<//Review></record>

<Date>1410310984527<//Date><text>Rowland Air is the best!  We have used them for the past several years whenever our AC unit needed repair.  They are always prompt, professional, courteous and reasonably priced.  When we experienced another problem with our AC recently, we called Rowland Air and Erich gave us the bad news that our 23-year-old system would need a major upgrade to continue to function efficiently.  Even though the final cost was much higher than we had hoped, we are very happy with our new Lennox HVAC system.  Erich and the other Rowland Air technicians who came to do the work were professional, courteous and efficient.  Erich explained the entire process to us and they completed the work within the promised time frame.  I highly recommend Rowland Air!<//text>< pics>

<Review>I got them through costco. Their installation and price is ok, the problem is that their service consultant promised that they will help me upgrade my gold membership to executive for the 2% cash back. It's just a $20 thing, it's minor, but it took me several phone calls to check and finally figured out that I need to do myself. It's a waste of time and effort.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1543885014420, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the 4 star review.

Gerardo of Rowland Air was very knowledgeable and efficient. He’s an asset to the company. He perfomed an excellent job on my ac to bring the unit in top shape. Thanks to Rowland as contractor participating in LADWP’s Ac optimizatin program!  Many thanks to LaDWp especially for this valuable program. It has saved me money by making
our home more energy efficient.</Review>

<Review>I replaced my Lennox Air Conditioner after 27 years of service.  And this Rowland crew from quote to install were outstanding.  Jeff, Marcus, Josh, Justin and a couple of others were professional, knowledgeable, and just very good at their jobs.  From the quote from Brett to finish 1st class service.  They were not the lowest bid, and probably on the higher side, but for once I got what I paid for... now it is up to Lennox to do it's job and run for as many years or more than my last Lennox.

I thought my 1st install by the last company was good...until I compared them to this job... there is no comparison!  I found where the last guys did short cuts and just shoddy work... this Rowland team were pros - ALL of them.  (and I paid top dollar last go around - no wonder my AIR was NEVER up to par - but when you don't know, you don't know - Know I know!)

I crossed off the local phone # for my last guys and will only call Rowland for service and advice going forward.  Just hope the unit I bought is as reliable as Rowland..

UPDATE: 12/2018 - Thomas was sent out for FREE maintenance check since install.  This guy knew what what was doing, knew the system, checked out everything, answered a couple of questions... All in all top flight person, good at what he does - personable, professional... This is the quality people that Roland sends out in the field... and this is why NOBODY but Rowland Air will touch my Lennox.</Review>< name>

We had a wonderful experience with Rowland.  We bought our home recently and the original system seemed wrong and wasteful.  The home didn't appear to cool/heat right no matter our strategy, electric bills always high even if used only at night, and bedroom cooling seemed weak. We didn't know what was wrong and thought it was normal so we stopped over at Costco and met Breann to talk A/C.  She got us all setup with an inspection with Ron and with our tough work schedule Rowland had many ways to accommodate us from inspections to installation and it was so simple and comforting. We went through Costco for a company we could trust and they were transparent on the process and our options.  They did provide simple solutions upfront to our problem, but I elected saving money on bills and invested up front on removing our Frankenstein system and upgrading for a new balanced 2 zone Fernice & A/C units for system operation of bedrooms independant of rest of our home.  We felt in control of the process; Breann stayed the hub throughout and reacted out to us for scheduling, Ron kindly addressed our home issues and setup install, Scot clearly laid out the install plans, and the installers we so clean and considerate with our home.  Oh and the system is so quiet, they said it was going to be noisy but it purrs compared to our last, I feel the air instead of hear it.  It transcends the zones so evenly and cools & heats so efficiently.  The controls are simpler than my last, missing some capability for the phone app, but it's fine our usage was always simple on/off versus scheduled programming (the wall interface has scheduling though).  The controls are very sleek though and easy to navigate, I like the the tiny zone control in my room. Oh and and they walk us through system operation and maintenance, my first home so honestly didn't know how these thing work.  Turns out not much to it, they'll follow up with us for the first year. Thanks!</review>

I set up an appointment with Rowland Air through Costco. Rick C. came out to give me an estimate for my HVAC system. He did more than that. He gave me all the information I needed to make a wise decision. Rick spent the time to explain to me how HVAC systems work. He did a cursory inspection so that he could recommend a system that would work for me.
After a few days I decided to go with Rowland Air. The crew that showed up on installation day were very professional. Rick also paid attention to my personal requests like relocating the condensor unit and gas outlet. The crew know thier job and are knowledgable regarding local code requirements so that they can provide an excellent installation the first time. And in a single day. They showed up at 8am, left by 6, and removed all old parts and trash when they left.
Rick personally followed through the entire process from estimate, installation, and follow up. This included Rick coming by a week later to test the system.
The bottom line is Rick delivered everything he promised Rowland Air would do. Rick's presentation was very low pressure and at the same time professional and informative. He told us how to save money wherever possible. Including Costco, Rowland Air, and local power company discounts. I'm very pleased with Rick C. and Rowland Air.</Text>

<text>My ac is barely a year old when it stopped working. Calling them cost me $250 and a whopping $2900 if they clean out dust and change the filter duct. I think I learned my lesson. Never call them again.<//text>< Name>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>My land lord hired this wonderful company to come out and replace a heater in my home which had been red tagged. On the day that Eric came out to do an inspection of the old heater, he was SOOOOOO detailed and concerned for my family!!! It made me feel so at easy that they were going to do their best to fix the problem and make my home warm again. They thought there was a possibility that they would not be able to come out till the following week to replace my heater, which I understood. But the very next morning Eric called me to tell me he was concerned about my house  being cold and did what they could to make it happen faster ;) So instead of it being installed on a Thursday, they came Monday morning!!!! They said they would call when they were on their way, but were scheduled to be there at 9:30. They called me at 9 and said they would be there in 20-30 min and they WERE!!!!!!! They came when they said they were going to!!!!! The two men who came to my home (which I am a single mom, so I think all of us have that little fear of being alone with people you dont know) were so polite and soooo quite!!!! They talked amongst themselves and you could barely hear what they were saying!!!! They were soooo professional as well!!! They cleaned up the mess that was made and when they left it was like nothing had been done ;)  Except for having this brand new beautiful heater in the wall ;)  They explained to me how it worked and Eric even came back before the guys left to re-inspect their work, which I thought was BEYOND professional!!! The office staff is friendly and warm and I just am very impressed!!!!! I would DEFINITELY recommend this company to everyone I know!!!!</Review>< pictures>
