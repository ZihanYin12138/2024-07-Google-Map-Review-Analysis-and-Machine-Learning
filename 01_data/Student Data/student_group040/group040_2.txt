<review>This place is amazing, I always get help right away and they have EVERYTHING!! Looks like they take good care of their animals, I got my baby crestie from here and it’s doing very well, very healthy. I go here for his crickets/worms too. Great service, great animals, and great supplies. They sell gecko powder food, bugs and mice, feeder tweezers, hides and other decor for the tanks, and actual tanks, much more! Love this place, definitely see myself getting more reptiles from here in the future!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>This is my favorite place for live rats for my ball Python! I’ve always gotten the best service here. This is literally a ONE STOP shop for reptile owners. I purchased a large tank and substrate and hides last time and it didn’t break the bank .  Most places are so over priced.

I definitely trust that I’m getting good deal when I shop here!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

This place is awesome! From start to finish of my purchase of my snake I felt like I was the only customer they had. Very quick responses and supported me on shipping as well when he ended up delayed (not out of the shop's fault). The snake came in healthy and as advertised. Very highly recommend. Very nice and knowledge people!< /Text>

Have purchased a ball python and an Argentine B&W tegu from here, both animals have been extremely healthy. Staff are knowledgeable and many of the animals sold here were bred in-house. Shop is always clean and well-organized. I enjoy stopping in anytime I'm in the area.</Text>

The employees were extremely nice and, helpful! I came in to look around because i planned on getting a leopard gecko and they gave extremely helpful tips like putting vitamin and calcium powder on the food which I was really happy to see the staff promoting! Their selection of geckos was beautiful! I really look forward to going there again!< /Review>

Friendly staff, fantastic prices, and a good variety of animals and insects to check out. I probably spent 20 minutes just looking at all the different animals they have. They have big and small. If you're looking for a simple, cheap, or an expensive, and more complex pet, I'd check their place out.</text>

Great little reptile shop. Nice selection of lizard's, frogs and other creatures. Guys are very knowledgeable and helping. If you don't see what you are looking for in the front just ask. They have a huge back stock at this and other locations. I highly recommend this reptile shop for all your reptile needs.< /review>

I swung by here right before closing time to basically kill time in a fun way for my twin 10 yr old boys. When I noticed they were just a few minutes from closing, I figured we would just eyeball a few cool looking reptiles and then get out in time for them to lock up.

We looked around a bit & despite the time, a gentleman asked if we needed any help. Even after telling him that I was using their facility as a quick, free mini-zoo (loser parent in for the win) he graciously and patiently shared his knowledge with my boys and me. He even opened another area to show us more & let my twins pet one of the monitors (biggest reptile they've ever touched) and hold a couple snakes! His casual & comfortable nature helped dispel any preconceived fears of snakes and large reptiles. All this while understanding that I wasn't there to buy anything. We never felt rushed to get out (my own guilt for keeping him there was pushing us to leave).

All of the pets awaiting homes were well taken care of & the place was very clean. No telltale sign by means of odor that there were dozens of reptiles inside.

If I EVER decide to get a reptile, it will be from here, where I know the reptile has been kept healthy & they'll spend the time educating their customer.</text>

We went by to see what they had to offer as far as snakes. They have a wide variety, so don't let the fact of them not having a typical store front fool you. The staff that helped us out was Chuy, John and Guy. All were very helpful and very knowledgeable. They helped us figure out the sex of a snake we bought earlier that day (not from this store) and ended up buying another snake! The staff was careful to explain any concerns/questions we had and know we will be going back to them for any further purchases and help. I'd highly recommend you check them out, even if not looking to buy and are only interested in getting yourself or your children some exposure to reptiles. They had a large variety of snakes, lizards, centipedes, etc., all from small to large.<//text>

I love this shop. The customer service is fantastic. The prices are great depending on what you buy. I buy my crickets here, the price for them are great. The reptiles can be somewhat over-priced, but it's an amazing little shop.< /review>

I would never come here again. First of all, the animals are in terrible conditions. Most of the reptiles are way too outgrown for their enclosure. The ball python I got was in a 10 gallon tank when I first saw her. She was pressing against the glass trying to get out. He told me she was a year old, but she didn’t even seem big at all or at least a decent size for a one year old female ball python. She is very malnourished. The owner seems to act like he knows everything but in reality his animals are in poor conditions. The carpet python I checked out had mites, my ball python had mites. Thankfully she is now mite free. I’m glad I saved her from that place, who knows how many other reptiles have mites!
He sold me a bunch of stuff I didn’t even need for my snake and when I returned it he charged me a 20 percent re stocking fee. My experience was overall terrible. Just some guy trying to make a quick buck. I wouldn’t recommend buying a pet here.</Text>

I went to Mr pickles especially for the garlic sauce. I didn't get that either. I had heard that the Blue Ravine location wasn't good. I should have listened. I won't waste my money there again.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Fantastic sandwich shop in Folsom! Their signature, Mr Pickle, is an amazing combo of fresh avocado, Crispy bacon, and grilled chicken all warm and smothered in goodness.

Not sold yet? Than how about a free, delicious, fresh baked chocolate chip cookie with your meal?

Still not sold? Wow. You are tough. They also carry the best potato chips I've ever had. Dirty Potato Chips and the Funky Fusion flavor is...unparalleled.

It does get pretty busy at lunch times, but well worth the wait - or order ahead and take it to go!</Review>

Twenty minutes into our wait, we were asked if we were waiting for something. If we had not already paid and wasted so much time waiting, we would have walked out right then. I love Mr. Pickles, but I will NOT be returning to this one.</review><gmapID>0x809ae69bdba9d2a9:0x5d2f289504fd5a02<//gmapID><user_id>117190067324240610507<//user_id>< date>

<text>I'm 35 years old, and I've never been in a sandwich shop with worse customer service than this joke of a restaurant. On two occasions, I have placed to-go orders for a signature Mr. Pickle sandwich. The first time, I got there about 10 minutes after my call, and I had to wait another 15 minutes before I got the sandwich. They were busy, so I excused it.

The second time, the man on the phone said they could have it ready in five minutes. I get over there about 10 minutes later. Still not done. Someone asks me if I want the sandwich for there or to go. I tell them to go. I wait several more minutes, and the sandwich is still not done, despite the fact that the people behind the counter outnumber the measly amount of customers in the restaurant. So I left to go to Subway down the sidewalk.

I work at a job where I have to clock in and clock out, so I don't have the luxury of wasting time for people who mislead me about when my food will get done. Is the food at Mr. Pickle better than Subway's? Sure. But what difference does it make when you're lied to on the phone and when the staff can't even make the restaurant's signature sandwich in a timely manner?</text>< name>

They were out of bread. Out of bread at 12:45 pm, you know right around when everyone takes their lunch. What a joke, no wonder mr pickles isn't doing so hot<//text>

I visited at lunch and the line was to the door.  However, it moved quickly and I had my fresh made sandwich within a few minutes.  The sandwich was very good. The bread is fresh and the ingredients were of quality. Also, the included cookie is a nice, delicious touch.<//Text>

Incompetent staff with no sense of business presentation awareness. A sandwich that was pre ordered was sitting on a shelf and they said it wasn't made yet. Then they never bothered to make it thinking it wasn't done. When w asked again they said it was on the shelf.</Text>

<Text>Mr. Pickle is a great sandwich place. Their food is good and service is excellent. I would recommend the "Hot T" sandwich on sweet bread. Very good.<//Text><UserId.>109919760316786979162<//UserId.><date>1524630463163<//date>< gmapID>

<Text>Stood in line for 20 minutes just so they could tell us they were cash only, because there systems were down, when it was our turn to order... No signs on the door letting people know. Know one mentioned it when we walked in or while we waited in line. Nothing until it was our turn. Absolutely no respect for other people’s time. Extremely unprofessional. Thanks for wasting my entire lunch break.  Now I have to go back to work without eating because I don’t have any time to go somewhere else.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x809ae69bdba9d2a9:0x5d2f289504fd5a02</Gmap_id>< pics>

Tasty and creative sandwiches. They are huge, so lighter appetites might want to share. We had a group of 6 people, and there was a line ahead of us. Service seemed slow, so this probably isn't the place to go if you're in a rush.<//review>

<date>1510176598662</date><text>We had a large group order for a office conference. It was an unusually busy day. I had tried calling in my order but was unable to do so because of how busy it was in fact. After standing in a very long line with 3 employees working the counter (one of which was in training and working very hard) We requested multiple staff members worked our order so we can back to the office in time. Every single staff member put in extra effort and insured quality every step of the way. I could not have been happier with the level of service and quality of food. The best part was they worked with smiles on their faces the entire time!<//text>< Name>

There's a new owner at this location now and he's done some great work here! Everyone is really friendly, the place is super clean, and you just can't go wrong with a Mr Pickles. If you've been here before and weren't too impressed, I'd definitely give it another try now!</review>

I always place multiple orders to-go when I come here and they somehow ALWAYS mess up on at least one order. The last time I called to let them know that they had made an error on one of my sandwiches and I got a rude, snarky response and they hung up on me. VERY RUDE and unprofessional. Although I enjoy eating Mr. Pickles sandwiches, I will not be returning to this location anymore.</text>

Very good sandwich, but the only reason I gave it a four is due to the light amount of meat they put on it.</review>

I went on my dinner break. I was the only one there, I was standing and looking at the menu and the guy asked if I was ready, rushed me, talked down to me, and he messed up my order. He didn't ask if I wanted my reciept, he didn't ask if it was there or to go. He just wanted me to leave and I was nothing but nice. What the hell ?< /text>

All the gas pumps had broken temper-proof stickers. The actual gas price was 20c higher than posted. I went in to pay instead of using the tempered reader at the pump and the owner/attendant was hassling me. She asked if I am American or cannot read English. I was treated very poorly without consideration nor civility. It was a most trying experience not to respond to her degrading mannerism. My spouse suggested that I should be more magnanimous.😭< /review>

Always worry about the broken tamper resistant strips that are on the pumps! But they always have a good prices and you can avoid the Costco lines and craziness. Cheaper for cash prices than credit.< /Text>

<text>STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAS STATION OR YOU'LL BE SCAMMED!

I purchase gas tonight on the way home at this station where my final price was $47.25.  I live in San Ramon and when I got home, I discovered that my American Express was just charged $100.00 from this station.  I called the several time, but no answer.  I left a message, but no call back.  Like many others that have reviewed this place, some have experience the same scam.  I will never come back to this place.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I had only 12 miles worth gas in the tank of my Lexus. Filled 2 gallons from this pump for a quick short trip. I left the pump to go to Wal-Mart about two miles. When I got there, I realized that pump did not actually fill the gas in. My guage was now showing 10 miles worth gas. Went back to pump, and complained to cashier. She refused to take responsibility. She even said other people also had complained similarly. But according to her, all were cheaters!
She even refused to give me her name to include in formal complaint. I had to pick my kid by that time so I left, filled gas from another pump. If I get time, I will complain to authorities after finding who to contact. For sure I would not go back to that pump.</Review>

"5" STARS! All the way for this grocery shop. I am very satisfied with their products. All that I need for cooking was all intact to this place. Their people were very accommodating, friendly, and suitable for their jobs. I am happy to have shopping in this place. Great service and pricing! No hidden charges compared to others! Splendid.< /text>

<review>This is a small and modest place with only 6 tables or so.  We shared a grilled fish dinner.  Good sized portion and delicious.  Got a side of mole sauce to put on the rice and dip the chips and it was great. Update: Went for a second time and tried out the Barbacoa (Lamb) taco. Very nice tender stewed lamb!<//review>< pictures>

Place is horrible. I dropped by about 8 pm at night and I literally stood there in the middle of the establishment with no one around me for a good 10 minutes. I could've just taken the register and no one would of seen me. I needed to specialty Mexican items and this was one of the few places that was open that late. two stars simply because they were open when no one else was but minus 3 stars for being open with not a single soul to help customers.< /text>

Great place for quality meat. They BBQ every Sunday and my girlfriend loves it. If you like meat, cooked or cook yourself, this is the best place on the westside.< /Text>

Finally found an evening that we had plans in the area.  We came by on a quiet Monday night with nobody else in the restaurant so we were initially wary, but we quickly discovered that the place is excellent!  The chips are very light-textured and the salsa is smoky with a little heat and the guacamole is very flavorful.  The fish tacos (they ran out of chile rellenos) were fantastic and everything was super fresh.  We will definitely be going back!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

A hidden gem! The lamb burrito was hands down the best. Ask for the sauce on the side. Guacamole and chips are sooo fresh. I finished the food before I could even take a picture :)</review>

Thank you Juan and the staff for being so accommodating to us this evening. The restaurant was hosting a private event unbeknownst a nosotros. We arrived ten minutes before close, looking for some tacos after seeing the good recommendations on yelp. I would have completely understood being turned away at the door under these circumstances however Juan received us with open arms. While we waited for whatever tacos were available, Juan offered us complimentary beverages, bbq chicken, and ribs. Wow! They had been smoking the meats out back, though We now know they have a bbq every Sunday from 10:30am -1pm. We'll be sure to come back for that, as well as check out their other location in Santa Monica.

I am completely shocked at the monumental generosity of this place. You will be hard pressed to find such hospitality these days in this city or anywhere.</Text>

We are so thrilled that we can get such authentic, delicious Mexican food here on the West Side.  This place could be hiding my Mexican grandma back in the kitchen, it's so real-deal!  My husband and I went back last night. He had the green chicken enchiladas and loved it, and I had the special: Bistec a la Mexicana. I was blown away!  Try Don Felix soon, and don't be afraid to try stuff you've never had before. You won't be sorry. I'm giving it a 5 star, since it does everything it sets out to do in my opinion. :)<//Text>

<text>Great al pastor tacos. But the real gem is the barbecue master who only works outside the shop on Sunday's from 1-4. The tri-tip melts in your mouth and the ribs are so good, they need no sauce. In fact, adding sauce would be an insult. He also grills a mean porterhouse.<//text>< user>

<rate>1</rate><text>Unfortunately these guys are BAD neighbors. They were playing Mariachi music so loud (on a Sunday) that I could hear it IN my apartment down the block. I asked them to turn it down because they were waking up sleeping babies in my home, and NOT only did they openly refuse, I was called a "f*****g a****le" to my face by the OWNER for daring to even bring up how inappropriately loud they were being. It's a shame that they don't have simple respect for the people who keep them in business. I'll never shop there again.<//text>< pictures>

1. I’m in a rush, give me a one sentence summary – affordable and quality cuts of meat, perfect for grilling or preparing for dinner.

2. The carniceria – my review only pertains to the carniceria, as I never have eaten at the restaurant which is attached to this market. I come to the carniceria to pick up meat for grilling and pan searing for tacos, and have always been able to find affordable and quality cuts of meat. My favorite are the al pastor ($3.99/lb), chicken fajitas ($2.99/lb), and chorizo ($2.99/lb). They also have a wide variety of cuts.

3. 5 stars off for cleanliness – they have an open doorway and (I think) keep the back door open as well to provide circulation since they have no air conditioning, so I usually see flies and other bugs zooming around. Not the most appealing sight when I’m trying to buy food which can be exposed to these bugs.

4. Location/parking – It can be easy to overlook, as it’s right on the corner of Sawtelle & Washington Pl. after you exit the 405 at Venice. They have a 15 minute parking zone right in front of the restaurant on both sides which is very convenient and helpful, especially when coming right off the 405.< /review>

Cozy tasting room with awesome brew and good people. Great for grab and go or posting up. Limited patio seating with some tables inside. Food truck scheduled for visits during peak. Solid merch and swag too. Big ups.<//text>

A very chill environment. Small patio with some seating and dog friendly. Garage bar door. We really liked the hazy IPAs. They know how to make a good hazy IPA. It was juicy and hoppy but smooth. They had an IPA on nitro... which turned out ok, but cool that they were able to have it on nitro. Ok to bring in your own food. Can’t wait to try more hazies.< /Text>

Went for lunch, had the Cuban sandwich and it is hands down the best Cuban I've had.  Great crowd, service was great (Kristen was pleasant to speak to and very knowledgeable) and it has a nice ambiance. I'll be back to enjoy. 5 stars.<//review>

Decent brewery with reasonable prices. I enjoyed the sour and smoked porter, but the other beers weren’t my cup of tea. They had a lady making tacos out front, which seemed like they could either be absolutely amazing or an instant regret. 50/50 chance.< /Text>

I am very happy with their beers and their service. Unicorn juice and Pair with Sandwich are really great beers.</review>

Stopped by for a quick sample during their soft launch and really like their Beach House Wheat. Weird location but it makes for a very fun little tap room that spills into  the brewery and out into the patio.
Congrats guys and best of luck on your new venture? I'll be back to try your California Lager when you have it ready to tap.</Review>

Great atmosphere. Patio is kind of small, but the windows open up to let people interact with the people inside. Pretty cool little spot. Board games to play if you have a group. About 10 beers on tap. Fan of the Unicorn Juice!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Artifex is our new go-to for pints and growler fills. Unlike other spots, Artifex will fill our non-Artifex growler and for less than 20$. Their IPAs are stellar and they have frequent food trucks outside. Despite being in a slightly hidden location, the tasting room is open, friendly, inviting, compared to the alternatives in San Clemente. We love it!< /Text>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>Visited around dinner time on a Friday.  Just up the hill from Lost Winds.  Not that well marked at night,  turn at the Allsize storage sign then it’s right in front of you.  Smaller tasting room, small bar right as you enter, then high top tables spaced throughout the brewery.  I have never seen access to brewing equipment quite like this - people were literally leaning up against the equipment.  Beer selection is 10 beers in a decent assortment styles.  Available as 5 oz,  10 oz,  pints and growlers.  Had some bottles in the cooler to go.  Locally, fun crowd.  Food truck out front.  Service was slammed, but still was fun, knowledgeable and happy.< /Review>< pics>

For me, it is the best microbrewery in South Orange county. NoName and Trigger Finger are top tier IPAs and virtually everything else the Brew is delicious. Great atmosphere, great beer. Who needs more.</text>

Very nice church. Has a Traditional Latin Mass service at 9AM on Sundays. Parking is a little tight so get there early. Praise be to God!< /review>

Beautiful, thriving, little parish just north of Downtown Long Beach.

I like that the altar is traditional and all the masses are ad orientem, that is, facing towards the tabernacle rather than away from it. And the fact that the tabernacle is front and center is a big plus; not to mention the communion rails and the more traditional method of giving communion. Good, good.

Fr Irving is a wonderful pastor, may the Lord grant him a long and spiritually fruitful life.< /Review>

It's so beautiful inside. My family and I have been members of this church for over 20 years. We have always been made to feel welcomed even when I strayed. I love coming to this church whether I'm asking the Lord for help or just thanking Him for all His blessings. This church offers many great services.<//Review>

I find this church to be one of the most beautiful churches I have ever belong to!  Not only exteriorly but within...and by that I mean the way its priests take care of all of its parishioners.  I feel like there is a genuine care for all of our souls and I only pray that more young people will come and listen.  This world needs a whole lot of Jesus!</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) God speaks in the silence
There is much respect for Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament! The father who celebrates the Mass is called Peter. For me he is Holy. God has given him the gift of singing. He has a contagious love for Jesus Eucharist and the Virgin Mary asks for prayers for Father Pedro x that he is alone and is already great and I need mycha prayer.

<Text>Abraham showed up on time. He's  polite, professional & works quickly.
He communicates very well & shows interest in his assignment.
This being my third repair with RS, I've grown to appreciate their provided service.

RepairSmith was, by far, the single most amazing mobile repair service I have ever experienced. Their quote was spot on, their appointment window arrival; on time, the quality of service as good, or better than a dealer visit and their technician, Elias, incredibly courteous, thorough and highly efficient and resourceful. Elias was done in under and hour, and made the repair a proverbial snap! Hats off to him and RepairSmith for an overall A+ experience. Cheers!<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I contacted RepairSmith to give my Ford Escape a quick once over to diagnose a few issues. The things he could fix on the spot he did, the work he was not able to do on sight I was given clear instructions on how to proceed. Overall a very pleasant and easy transaction, and in the future would definitely use them for any minor auto work that can be done in the driveway. Very friendly, convenient and inexpensive.< /Review>< Pictures>

<name>Mary Grace T<//name><Date>1619574507128</Date><rate>5<//rate><text>I LOVE the concept of Repair Smith. We’ve already used them 3 times in the span of 2 weeks for all our family cars. Each time we had Tony, who was awesome. Great customer service, Tony was warm and friendly. He was trustworthy and honest for the repairs we needed done. I’m going to ask for him every time! We paid a fraction of the cost the dealerships quotes us. I love love love the fact that the repair shop comes to you. If there are any delays we are text right away. I don’t even mind if there are delays because I’m home anyways. I’ve been recommending Repair Smith to all my friends!<//text>< pictures>

Arrive right on time and very communicative.
No in person contact needed because I can just leave the key outside.
Excellent service.
Unlike other maintenance places, They don't recommend repairs if they are not needed<//review></record></dataset><record>

They came early and they were extremely professional and nice. I would recommend this service to anyone and I plan to use them again.<//text>

Tony was communicative, friendly, explained everything very well, and was quick and efficient. Plus, coming to our house at what would be considered 'after hours' at no additional cost.
Pricing was exactly what we expected, and was very reasonable. I would definitely use RepairSmith again - especially if they send Tony!</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Super easy to schedule and a hassle free experience. They showed up at my home where the car was stuck, assessed the issue (and overall car health), and provided a very easy to read inspection report. I was not pressured to use them for the recommended repair but sure will be after this initial experience. Highly recommend due to the convenience and professionalism I experienced. Thank you!< /Text>< pictures>

He was friendly, knowledgeable and made sure I knew what my car needed in the future as well. I’m a very happy customer and will be using RepairSmith for every car concern or tune up in the future!! My car is working great now.< /Review><user_id>104278025338887259421</user_id><name>Zach G</name></record></dataset><record>
<Text>Repair work needed was to replace a dead Alternator

Great! My experience with RepairSmiths was Great!!!  From the easy to apply and make an appointment online service, to the Outstanding and Professional job the mechanic Elias did on my car. Elias contacted me before he arrived. Was on time. Once done he explained to me the repairs he made and also recommended other future services that my vehicle may need so that it would continue to run at it's best. I was and still am very Impressed at the service and repairs my vehicle. I am recommending this company to Everyone as your go to Mechanic service.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Really enjoyed my experience with RepairSmith. They came out as scheduled and were very professional. While they didn't fix what "i thought " was the problem it was what was best. They actually did a proper diagnosis of the issue and let me know they didn't need to just swap parts for no reason. My car had much more extensive issues with the 4x4 differential so i really appreciate the honesty of the mechanic and the company. I would definitely use this service again.< /text><time>1616456184982< /time>< Resp>

I was skeptical about a mechanic coming to my place because I have never heard of a mechanic going out to tour home before...But I was highly impressed that Abraham was very nice and resourceful. He walked me through all the problems he found on my car.  Answered all the questions I was concerned about. And the best part of my experience was, I didn't have to leave my house! Im glad I experienced this. The price that i was quoted for was decent and affordable. Thanks! Great job!<//text>

<review>Didn't know what to expect because it's not like you're taking your car to you usual mechanic shop. However, super convenient. I had chose this based on the reviews, and they can't lie if so many people are satisfied! The mechanic "Elias" was super professional, knowledgeable, and nice. Was very upfront and helped me with so many questions, fixed my errors, and knew exactly what my lights were for( he worked on a 2014 BMW 328i). Was super convenient and he gave me a lot of advice and actually showed me what he did and what the procedure for my break fluid exchange was for and what it meant. I really appreciate it. I will definitely be calling this company for my mechanic services. Thanks Elias!</review><UserId.>115817270665763277575<//UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Abraham was extremely helpful and professional. Repaired the starter and gave me some additional info too. The price quoted was about the same as the dealership, but at home...... no car expense is something we want, but he was helpful and courteous.< /Text>

I just recently bought a new used 2o18 Kia Sportage and after the car driver delivered the car and left, the car died. My neighbor jumped the battery. Then I was told to go to Big O tires and get a diagnostic test + plus I was approved to get a new battery. Big O says I didn’t need a new battery. So yesterday May 5, the battery died again and my neighbor jumped started it again. I made an appt with RepairSmith and Julian came today. He explained everything he was going to do but needed to get authorization from the warranty company. He took photos of the car then had to go outside the garage to upload the pics and call the warranty co. So this was what took the longest- wondering where he went. I sat in my car and waited for him. Then he returned, told me a new battery was approved and then he installed the new battery. So the whole appt took an hour and Julian was very professional and courteous.</Text>

Saw ad on Instagram and found out about this great idea! I didn’t have to drop car off at mechanic shop early to get it done by end of day. Best part is easy way to schedule repair and they have arrived within timeframe.

Had my wheel bearing replaced but check engine light came on. They came back and fixed the issue. Will be using this business a lot more in the future. They are professional.</Review>

Everything about my experience today with Pav Bhaji Hut was amazing. I loved the hospitality, as the owner introduced me to this new food I’d never tried, showed family photos, and talked about the history of his business. The food was so delicious, and great portions for such a fair price. I also loved the watermelon juice! It is obvious this restaurant is his passion, and I felt so welcomed in this space. I can’t wait to bring my friends!</review>

Always the exact same taste, pav is soft, bhaji is finger licking good. I felt the normal bhaji to be spicier that my expectation, the spicy bhaji was extremely spicy for you. I would have given them a 5-star but they only offer delivery, no pick up in Fremont and food is ~$2 more expensive on DoorDash. So end up paying $2 extra on each item + the service charges of DoorDash. I would really like the option of store pick-up in Fremont.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<user_name>Steven Giammarco<//user_name><review>At first, I thought all those perfect 5-star reviews had to be fake. They're not. I visited the Fremont Blvd and met Umesh. What a nice, friendly, passionate and knowledgeable owner. Super generous. The restaurant has a fantastically simple menu and the cold-pressed drinks are so fresh and refreshing. I can't wait to come back. You have a great thing going here. Keep living the American Dream and honoring your customers and we'll keep coming back to support you!<//review>< rating>

<review>This place is amazing! It's quickly becoming a regular lunch spot for me. It has the most friendly owner and staff you'll come across. The spicy pav bhaji with cheese is my favorite.  The cold pressed pineapple juice is also a great! Do yourself a favor and try this spot out while supporting your local business!< /review>< pics>

Food is delicious. But two reasons for 1-star. Price charged for pickup ($11.13)  is higher than price in menu (9.99). They just charge it without notice. This place doesn't have a phone, so you have to order in shop and wait for pickup< /review>

<Text>I liked the Pav Bhaji. But I have had better ones in Fremont in less price. I am very very unsatisfied with the juice. It was way to expensive for the quantity.

Pav Bhaji Hut offering authentic Indian Pav Bhaji. If you are looking for Indian spicy taste. This is the best place. You must try. We always make a stop to Pav Bhaji hut as when we come to Bay Area from Chico. They also offer an excellent cold pressed juices. I think, it is the best juice that I had so far. They offer excellent food quality and 5-star customer service to their customers.  I highly recommend Pav Bhaji hut.<//Review>

<Text>Ran out of Regular Pav Bhaji and didn't tell us until after the fact. Did offer a refund, but should have said something when I ordered the items. The Bhaji was sub par. Nothing special but definitely will visit again due to the simplicity of the restaurant. It would be nice to able to pre-order ahead of time.<//Text>< user_name>

<review>This is an awesome place. I am glad I found it. It is the best juice place in Fremont. They serve cold pressed juice squeezed on demand. They have the usual juices but if you are a health freak ask them to press you a blend of beets, celery, apple (yum, yum) I have stopped going to Jamba juice. Instead I am a regular here. I visit them after my jog and I love the daily ritual.< /review>< Response>

Truly authentic and delicious Pav Bhaji. Loved the attention to detail and the decor even though I had to do a takeout due to the COVID restrictions. Love that it’s just Pav Bhaji on the menu -the Amul cheese addition for the kids version was awesome.   Was also great chatting with the owner and hearing of his passion and motivation.
Hoping they have a less spicy and Jain ( no garlic) version in the future to complete the Mumbai offerings on the menu.</Text>

Extra push for buying cheese pav bhaaji instead of simple pav bhaaji could be a point of improvement.</review><Response>None</Response>< Time>

Perfect Pavbhaji. People are comparing this Pav Bhaji with Mumbai's Sardar Pavbhaji but reality is there is no comparison. In my opinion,  there is no comparison to Pavbhaji from this place. Not only taste of the food but quality and experience is awesome as well.

I met the owner- Umesh and he explained me entire process of making Pavbhaji and how they collect authentic ingredients- very passionate guy. He truly wants to serve good food.

Cold press juice was such a high quality as well. Some might think that it's on expensive side but you are getting real juice not just sugar syrup.< /review>

This place opened up a new branch in Fremont and I had been waiting eagerly for them to open this one because it was closer and I wouldn’t have to drive all the way to Lawrence Expwy. The food is better than ever and the ambience of the place is hip and cool. The place is completely vegetarian so no chance of cross contamination and they also offer cold pressed fresh juices made right in front of you, nothing added but fresh goodness. I tried the beet juice with ginger shot and loved the benefit to my system and the taste. It is always exciting to eat from here and they were observing strict and proper hygiene & precautions for covid. Have been loving their food since the first time couple years ago. I usually get spicy pav bhaji. Definitely recommend it.</Text>

< Review>
They charge prices higher than menu prices and worse still they dont tell you. One PB on menu online is 9.99, but charge is 10.38+0.75=11.13 when ordering in store for pickup. Not a big amount, but I dislike the lack of transparency. They also dont have phone number to order.</Review>

<Review>Loved the Pav Bhaji. Simply the best. I thought 12$ is expensive for a Pav Bhaji but it’s ok because it’s real good and well packed and nice place to sit and hang around except during these COVID days.

Edit: I left an amazing review for this place initially. After 3 more visits, I’m not sure I’m coming back.

Our first visit was amazing. Who I presume is the owner (an Asian man) was extremely kind and helpful. It was 12:30am and he made us the best Thai Tea we’ve ever had. He made us feel welcome and relaxed. That’s why I wrote a good review.

Our second visit was awful. My husband and I went to get Thai Tea from here at 12:00am. One of the workers (a Hispanic male) refused to serve us Thai Tea and told us they stopped serving any drinks at 6:00pm.

Our third visit was OK. A lady served us and we ordered Thai Tea. We asked and she said they never stop serving drinks.

We visited a final time tonight. At around 12:30am, we went to Super Star Donuts. The same worker from my second visit was there. He was in the back making donuts and his mask was on his chin. One of his colleagues stopped making donuts and came out to serve us. He DID NOT have on a mask, even while making the donuts. That’s when I left and went to Winchell’s instead.

Masks are mandatory in store. There’s a sign on the door. So why are these employees (who are breathing on my food) not wearing masks?

I won’t be returning. It’s such a shame because their Thai Tea is delicious, but I value my ability to breathe more than donuts.</Review>

< Review>
I have been in Fontana since 1991, and would always buy donuts here, I stopped buying a few months ago, last Tuesday I bought a half of dozen and all of their donuts taste really bad, they have a really nasty aftertaste of "old oil" and heavy, not light and soft as before, I called the shop this morning and a lady with a heavy accent answered, I asked for the owner and she replied that the owner is not in, and she ask me what do I need to talk to the owner for?, I asked her who she is, and she answered just a worker,  then I asked her again and she claimed to be the manager, I told her my concern about the donuts tasting bad and that it might be that the oil they fry the donuts in may be too old, she got angry and hanged up. Really? that is how you handle your business with customers? customers are you paycheck, no customers no paycheck.</Review>

<review>The croissants are delicious and often sold out before 7AM.

The coffee is great too. It's the epitome of doughnut house coffee.

Prices are good too.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Cute idea but not a good haircut (my daughter was great at holding still or else I would totally understand the choppy cut). The place has a lot of potential but $30 for a bad haircut that needs fixed was a bummer for us. Also, I would suggest to them to get some quick drying nail polish. My daughters nail polish was instantly messed up as soon as we left the salon.< /review>

<Review>First time here as the other kids salon we went to closed permanently due to the pandemic.  Brought both my daughters for the Frozen Jeep haircut.  My 7 year old enjoyed watching Frozen 2 while getting her hair cut.  Tammy did a great job with cutting her stick straight hair.  My daughter also enjoyed the "minicure".  My almost 2 year old was quiet and preoccupied with the Jeep buttons and steering wheel.  She looked very cute after the haircut.  Great experience and will be booking them here for future cuts.  Worth the 25 minutes from our house!< /Review>< Rate>

Miss Jen was awesome with our shy little girl.  We just did a trim with her package, but they were amazing with her and all the pampering. We bought the super conditioner that they used because it worked miracles on her curls.< /review>

Tammie is great! I've been bringing my two boys (5 and 2) in to see her for over a year now. She always remembers us and greets us with a smile. My oldest does not like getting haircuts, and Miss Tammie handles him very well!</text>

Brought my daughter here for her birthday updo and some extensions. The only updo that the hairdresser recommended was curls because of the extensions. The curls did not look good and began falling out right away. Do not recommend for updos at least, too expensive.</Review>

Well once JENN started my son didn’t like it to much but she was very patient and understanding! She tried everything and lastly she brought out the lollipops and that was it he sat there most of the time. He moves a lot and JENN just took her time and made it happen! Over all all the ladies in the shop where awesome helpful and so kind! We got the first haircut package which was $4 more but was awesome for my sons baby book! After seeing the patients and the time they take to cut our child’s hair Explains why they cost a little more but the experience was so worth it!

Amazing hair stylists for children. They are kind, patient, understanding, gentle, and awesome. The whole place is set up to be a kid friendly environment with racecar chairs and TVs to distract the kid while their hair is cut. It is very calming to the kiddos and they love it.</Review>

It's the only place my kids will let their hair be cut! The stylists have great patience and my little dudes always walk away looking great! They love the tv's in front of their chairs, car/themed seats, and getting to pick their own show to watch during their haircut.< /Text>

<review>I was scared after reading these reviews, but I'm glad I took my three year old.  Clean, friendly, efficient and I liked that all the women cutting hair gave off the Mom-vibe.  They were all patient and diligent, all social with the kids and parents.   When the stylist was ready, there was another kid in the car my son chose.  She offered to let us wait for the police car or switch to a different car; my son was pretty chill and was fine with any car, so we opted to get going.
Cars were all awesome, the TVs were good for distracting (and they have everything available on them), the lady that cut my son's hair was fast but careful and when my son was still patiently sitting after she finished the cut, she continued to perfect the style with small details.  She admitted she couldn't usually get so precise when a kid is basically flopping around in the car and I can't blame her.  If your kid can follow basic instructions I believe you'll come out with a good end result.  I was impressed with the business and would definitely return.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I LOVE this place. It has such a friendly atmosphere. Connie cut my sons hair and did such an amazing job! It was his first haircut and he freaked out, but she didn’t give up on us. She did everything to make him feel more comfortable. 😊
They have video games, Netflix, and so much more to help keep the kids occupied and so much patience.
I originally went to the barbershop on Camp Pendleton, they were very rude and impatient with my son. My son hated it, so we decided to go here, and I’m so glad we did!!!
We will definitely come back!!!
My son also got a lock of his hair, balloon, sucker, and a certificate.< /Text>

I came here because I had heard good things about it, and chose to come here instead of our usual spot, but I left every disappointed. My son is really good about getting his hair cut, so the cute bat mobile he sat in and Netflix were just a bonus. I showed a picture to the stylist of what I wanted my sons hairs to look like. Immediately she said “oh no I can’t do that because he has curly hair” mind you his curly hair has never been an issue before to anyone else. So she said she would do a regular boys cut. I told her I still wanted to keep some of the curls, just at a more manageable level. Well, the stylist started to hack away at my sons beautiful hair and he ended up with the most uneven, awful haircut. She cut his bangs way too short and left one side longer than the other. The backside, when you comb it out, is all different lengths, and on the right side he has one long curly hair. I called them back and they offered to fix it for free but I said no. I don’t trust anyone there to fix his hair. They also told me over the phone that their stylist who typically cuts boys hair would be the one who would fix it. Um what? I would assume that any stylist at this establishment specifically for kids would be qualified to cut a boy or girls hair. After all they are the “professionals”. Needless to say I declined their free offer to fix his hair as well as their offer to givw him his next hair cut for free. Wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.< /review>

<Text>Second time here, first experience was OK, simply came back for my 3 year old who loves cars (Disney) they have the lightning McQueen car to sit in while getting haircut. I came in as walk in and acted as if it was uncommon, they treated me as if my business wasn't wanted, I guess because I'm not white. Michelle is pretty mediocre, they seem understaffed and overcharge. I'm aware haircuts for boys are $20 no matter how little they are taking off. Won't be returning their customers lacks in all aspects or maybe I'm just the wrong color.</Text>< userid>

A bit expensive in my eyes for 5 min toddler hair cut. Stylist did a decent job but did not bother trying to talk to us at all and making my daughter feel easy about getting her hair cut. Customer service could greatly improve<//review>

<Text>They did a great job with my 2 yo son, even though he was fussy and just not having it. We moved to 3 different chairs and he was offered a stuffed "Sharky", TV shows, video games and a sucker. Even though he was writhing in my lap, the stylist was able to do a good job and didn't seem to be phased by his shenanigans.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

First time here , made an appointment and when making appointment asked what car my two year old would like and being that he is obsessed with cars , I choose lightning car. We got there , waited 5 min when zaida said come get in the police car . I said we're waiting on that car and she said well they aren't done and we have appointment ( no one else waiting ) and I said yes we have an appointment for that . She wouldn't ease up so I gave up .  She rushed his hair cut which I think made him uncomfortable. My son had plenty of haircuts and doesn't fuss. Maybe he was having an off day but I feel she was a little rough.  I will try this place again because yes the cut came out nice just very messy and customer serviced lack .</text>

<Review>Sharkey's charges the same amount regardless of how much hair they cut. I saw the price list when I went in, and I'll admit I didn't clarify beforehand so this is kind of my fault, which is why I'm passing it along to you. I asked for bang trims for my 2 girls and made the false assumption that a bang trim couldn't cost as much as a full haircut. I also got my own hair trimmed but did not get a blow-dry and style. Again, I assumed I wouldn't be paying for things I didn't get. We were there less than 30 minutes and my total was almost $80 before tip. She charged $20 each for my girls' bang trims, and $35 for my wash and trim. I realize it's my fault for not clarifying the price before starting services, but lesson learned, I will not go back. I feel like I paid for the gimmick of sitting in a salon chair that looks like a mini cooper and getting to watch cartoons while getting your hair cut more than a quality haircut. I suggest Supercuts or the base salon. I've used both and have been happy.< /Review>< pics>

Connie did an AMAZING job cutting my nephews hair! We actually went to the barber shop on Camp Pendleton at first but they were being extremely rude and impatient with him. HE'S TWO! THIS WAS HIS FIRST HAIRCUT! Anyway, Connie (I hope I spelled it right) was very patient and understanding with us. If he didn't like something, she has the patience to change tactics until we found something that works. She definitely eased his mom's stress as well as mine and whenever I have children of my own, I will definitely bring them here! Thank you so much! And they had special pricing for first haircuts that included a certificate, a lock of hair, an after picture, candy, and a balloon for $26.95! Oh, that's BEFORE the military discount lol... anyway, this place definitely deserves more stars!<//text>

Worst customer service ever...had a appointment for my son but was running 15 min late. We called to make sure they would still take us, they confirmed. Drove  all the way there, waited for over an hour, there was no one waiting, and she still didn't take him... I mean really??? I've been bringing my son and daughter here for years but will not be going anymore...< /review>

I went there to give my son a hair cut, but the older lady with shorter hair looked like she didn’t want to help. She kept the hair clipper on and advised her that he was scared of the noise and she brought it supper close to him which got him more scared. And I’m sure they might have a silent clipper for toddlers his age but she didn’t even try to help. Very disappointing .< /Text>

I'm very upset with my sons hair.
Your paying them! To do a great job.
Don't let them talk you into what's easier for them and faster.

Always love it! They are so patient. Recommend an appointment because they take their time with the kids! Have kid tv. Cars to sit in, stickers, ballons and candy!  A little spendy vut worth it not to have a screaming kid. Jen or michelle are both amazing! Can book your apointment online for next day :) offer a military discount.</review>

She was just rushing. Didn't even take her time. It was like a 5 min haircut crappy job. You can tell she cant even line up. I asked for a combover she did a horrible job. If you cant do a certain hairstyle let us know instead of saying that you can.  Very disappointed. Never going back to her gain.<//Review>< pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Absolutely the Best. I'm an overbearing mom n we brought dad n grandma for my 6 year olds 1st hair cut. All 3 were surrounding my son videoing n taking pics, my son can't pick a style, i am picky about cutting style n tools. They were so accomadating and not just to us ,but a young boy refused to get a cut so they let him play at lil table they have n waiting area n cut it there rhrough his tears ( w moms ok). So awesome and put all my fears to ease.
Also we donated his hair n got half price, but prices were reasonable amyways. 26 for 1st cut w certificate containing b4 n after pic n lock of hair.</Text>< Pics>

I love this store and everyone working there. Every time I walk in I have at least 5 employees asking me if I need any help. Customer service at this location is excellent. I always find what I need and more and am always happy and satisfied with my purchases.<//Text>

<rating>4</rating><Review>The experience was fairly easy. They did not have what we decided upon from the showroom floor available any longer and wouldn’t offer much discount for something similar.  We settled for a different frame and bought mattresses etc. elsewhere.  The staff were otherwise helpful and attentive and it was a pretty good overall experience.< /Review>< pics>

Highly recommend living spaces!</text>

< Review>
The living spaces store at Millbrae was a good experience the salespeople are helpful but not too pushy. The prices are good and the furniture is stylish. The quality is decent. The salesperson  Garrick was really helpful so I highly recommend him,  he helped me with my custom chair order. Thanks Garrick !< /Review>

I don't even know where to begin...2 weeks ago we purchased a sofa that was supposed to be delivered today. At the time of our purchase we were told the sofa was available by the woman that assisted us with the order. I thought it was strange that she told as one sofa was in stock because a prior employee told us it was back ordered, but she said the prior employee didn't know what he was talking about. She even suggested we finance the couch at 0% for 12 months so we thought it was a great deal. I never take store credit but in this case I made an exception even though I knew that doing so would lower my credit score slightly since its a hard credit pull, but I figured at the time it was a good deal because I was expecting to receive my sofa yesterday and pay it off in 12 months. Fast forward to the day of our delivery date, both my husband and I receive texts, phone calls, and emails two days and the day prior of our delivery date confirming our delivery and were even given a time frame. We took the day off from work to wait for the delivery and waited the entire delivery hour window and no show. No phone call from the company either. So we call the customer service line and we find out there was no delivery scheduled for that date. What?!! Unbelievable! How is that even possible?! And then we are told the sofa is no longer available and we will have to wait until the end of May!!! Incredible!! And for the inconvenience they can only grant as 10% discount. Ridiculous! So we go to the store in Millbrae where we purchased the sofa and we are told by all the managers we spoke to there was nothing they could do besides give us a 10% discount and exchange the sofa for another one that could be delivered sooner. We looked around and found out that the majority of their inventory that came close to our price range or style was not available or had a long delivery time frame. All they could do was apologize and direct us to another person to help us. We spoke to approximately 5 employees with 3 of them being managers. The sales team attempted to help us find a replacement and for that I give this place a 1 star! Otherwise I would give them a negative 5 stars! We spent almost 3 hours of our time in the store dealing with this with no further resolution, in addition to spending our entire day at home waiting for our sofa. We ended up having to cancel our order at the end, with no sofa and a hard pull on my credit report. By far, this is the most HORRIBLE experience Ive encountered at any furniture store!!! BEWARE of purchasing from this store!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND it!!!! Save your money and time and go elsewhere!!!<//Text>

<Review>Reza assisted me initially when I came in recently. He was very personable and friendly. I came in just a couple days later and finalized my purchase for a new couch with Sima. She was also very friendly and helpful. Happy to see the couch ordered would arrive within a week and cancelled my order with Macy’s for a couch that took several months to be sent. Definitely will be coming back to make future purchases at this location!<//Review>< Rating>

We are No. CA. Paradise folks. Lost our home 2 years ago in the Camp fire. We chose Living Spaces to decor our new home due to their vast collection and also due to workmanship of their Living Spaces collection. MELISSA listened to our wants/needs/wishes and some funny perks about personal style and by her end of work day we were able to choose 4 rooms of furniture.  They will deliver to our town of Paradise once our new build has been completed. A few items of accessories we took today since we wanted to make sure those would be available for us. Then Luca and Royce helped to make sure these were safely packed and loaded into our vehicle for the drive back home. We received that specialty shopping experience with a designer at an affordable cost. They made it fun and we're so satisfied with how our new home will be coming together.< /Text>

Reza was fabulous. He helped us out in choosing which kind of recliner sofa that will suit to our needs. Our first time to buy with Living Spaces, definitely not the last👍<//review>

Such a great experience! We needed quite a few pieces and going into this I was a little overwhelmed with what we needed and worried we’d blow past the budget. But my worries were for no reason! The sales associate that helped us was so nice, patient and knowledgeable. She really wanted to understand what we wanted and were looking for and offered us may options based on our preferences and budget! I will definitely be going back for more furniture needs!<//Review>

She gave us space, answered our questions and was great throughout the purchase process.  Well done Ester.< /Review><date>1611470621183<//date>< user_name>

<Text>Highly recommend: lots of selection and very affordable compared to other furniture stores. We had resigned ourselves to paying over $2000 for a regular sized sectional, and then visited this place which is super reasonable and has a ton of variety and customizability. Definitely check this place out - we are buying our sofa from here!<//Text>< user_name>

I absolutely love the large chaise sectional sofa we bought at this living spaces, but my poor rating is because the staff does not know the care needed for the merchandise they are selling. I specifically asked what do I use to clean this sofa and if they sold the cleaner but I never got a straight answer. This is not okay, if you go to the oral surgeon and ask me about a dental implant and how to maintain it I will tell you exactly what to do and what to buy. Please managers or people in charge, sell the appropriate cleaners for your sofas, I want to keep it looking as nice as possible .<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>The store looks great, however every single model of sofa I liked need to be custom made because they didn’t have stock, so I custom ordered one I found on the floor. It took two months to build and I set the delivery date, however I was called to stay overtime at work and missed the delivery. If you miss the date, they don’t hold your item for redelivery, they send it to their warehouse to where it’s ‘reprocessed’. Turns out someone bought a section of my sofa within hours in the warehouse and they needed to remake that section. At this point it’s been two months.

I then went to the store, to get update. The section was being made but I needed a couch to sit on so I opted to have the two portions which were still listed in the warehouse, delivered. Fast forward to The delivery date and I get a call telling me they’re looking for it in the warehouse and will take another 24-48 hours. Now three months.

It’s a broken system and if it works great, you bought a nice sofa, however pray nothing happens in your life to make you miss that first delivery date. I now have one sectional that I can’t confirm is being made, the main couch and ottoman that’s missing and waiting for a refund.  It has been a pretty disappointing experience considering I spent thousands of dollars and essentially I gave them a no interest short term loan while I wait for a refund. This is the Millbrae, Ca location.</Text>< user_name>

<Review>Initially I was not to happy with sales staff “Umit” asked a few questions and told him what I was looking for. He used his tablet and told me the two sofas I looked at were not available in any other colors other than the floor model. I asked if there was something else in brown or black. His reply was no and he handed me a warranty brochure , wrote his name on it and left. I walked around and sat on another sofa I liked. A sales girl named Princess approached me and asked if I needed help. I told her what I was looking for she showed me a sofa and showed me all the features, knew the setback necessary for the recline and all the other functions. Very knowledgeable and pleasant. I asked about the warranty she explained in detail the manufacturer warranty and the extended warranty. She checked availability told me the date about a month out and the delivery options. I ordered a new sofa and the extended warranty. Very good experience had it not been for her I was ready to walk out.<//Review>< pictures>

Worst products and customer service. I bought an automatic recliner sofa less than a month ago and it would stop working and when I call the warranty they said they will be able to service it only after 2 months. Are you this stupid to provide service? Leave alone a product that doesn’t work.< /Text>

Their COVID policy to enter is done nicely, temp check with hand sanitizer as u enter.
Everyone there was very nice and helpful. Their prices are very reasonable. I was able to purchase a power recliner for under $800. Free delivery and schedule for delivery on our anniversary. All done in 30 mins!< /review>

<Text>This was one of the most frustrating experiences I’ve ever had with this company, which I’m very familiar with. The customer service agent that I spoke with at the Millbrae location was completely out of touch during our conversation and it seemed as if she wasn’t even attempting to listen to what I needed from her. My order was completely messed up resulting in me having to reschedule a more expensive delivery after spending 45mins trying to complete this transaction. This employee was lazy, negligent, and honestly shouldn’t be behind the customer service desk< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I was shopping for a new sofa with my girlfriend. We found one that we remembered from a few months back. After trying it out for several minutes an associate approached is. Wilmer was very informative and helpful. He mentioned the space we would need around the sofa when reclining it. He also described the power options. Once we made our decision he found a shopping option that for our needs and schedule.< /Text>

<review>We’ve had some issues with our first order at Living Spaces we are trying to get resolved with our Magnolia Home furniture, but I care back for a convertible sofa for our guest room. Wilmer and James were fantastic. I came to get an As-Is piece that was sold, but was able to buy a brand new one under warranty!!! Hopefully we can get our other issue resolved since the integrity of our living room set is in question.</review>< gmap_id>

<review>My review is in two parts: in-store experience (5 stars) and delivery experience (1 star)

In-Store Experience: I shopped at the Millbrae location and the staff was extremely friendly without being pushy. The entire experience was very relaxed and the sales team showed us many different options for fabric and walked us through the ordering process, assuring us that we could coordinate the delivery for a single date. This was important to us and one of the main reasons we chose to purchase from Living Spaces, as our HOA has delivery notification requirements and we preferred to only go through that process once.

Delivery: This is where things got very confusion. I received two notifications regarding my delivery. One notification informed me that my items (13 items) were ready for delivery. I received a second notification via email as well as text that 4 items were arriving. This was confusing, so I contacted customer support. The representative informed me that she saw that only 3 items were arriving! She was helpful in getting me set up for the delivery of my other items, which unfortunately had to be separated out to another day, but one item was back-ordered. This is frustrating for a few reasons:

- We have to provide our HOA with advanced notice of large deliveries, and this caused a late notification and second arrangement.
- I took time off work on one so that I could be available to receive the items.
- All communications/information were contradictory
- I never received any notification or communication about the delay of the other items or the back ordered item, and only found out after proactively contacting Living Spaces and only after noticing discrepancies in the notifications.

I hope that whatever operating system or management infrastructure is in place that coordinates real-time warehouse availability and customer communication is figured out.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Living Spaces is the best place to shop for furniture - high quality but reasonably priced. Staff is friendly  without being too pushy. And it’s well lit, doesn’t feel cramped, and really clean!<//text>

Worst warranty experience ever !! I’d give this place a negative stars if possible. Couch broke a year in and it took them now going on 6 months to replace . Went to store to pick out a replacement couch only to be told nothing is available . There is a definite lack of communication between management and sales reps .<//Review>

We came into living spaces and with a specific couch in mind and told our sales rep to show us one of the couches we found online. He then helped us find a few more that were exactly what we were looking for and we found one that we fell in love with and bought right away! He helped us get this delivery fast (just 1 week) and with the budget we had in mind.

Great experience and even better couch!<//review>

We purchased a couch and were able to arrange an exchange for our bedroom set after realizing we liked a different one upon seeing it in person. They worked with our moving schedule to make sure the delivery would take place once we were at our new home. The associate even walked us through what furniture we already had and what we needed. And he kindly told us the price and sizes of their box springs so we could pick the perfect one for the new bedroom set. We even got expert advice on which color couch would go well with our space. Very thorough information and advice was given so we could make the right decisions for our new home. Very happy with the experience.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Review>I've wanted to patronize this store ever since I heard that Living Spaces gave free mattresses to everyone who lost everything in the Coffee Park fire. I bought a beautiful kitchen curio cabinet which was everything I was looking for and more! Ken was my salesperson. He couldn't have been more informative, patient and kind. He even let me pay with 3 different gift cards, always with a smile on his face. He kept saying,  "hey, might as well get rid of those cards!" Give this store your business with confidence!  You will feel good about giving them your business, and will benefit yourself at the same time.< /Review>< userid>

<text>Not shaming the workers but the company in general is not good. I purchased items from them and two of my items that were supposed to be brand new came used. The sofa had a toothpick hiding on the sides and somebody’s strand of hair. My dining table also came chipped and broken which could mean they used it for display or it was returned. Either way I paid for full price new items and that is what I should be getting, I would expect my things to come like that if I were to buy open items or items used for display.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>We were greeted by a woman who took my temperature at the door and then sprayed my hands with a hand sanitizer.  I appreciate the care they took with customers coming in to shop due to covid.  All sale reps wore a mask.  They made sure everything was cleaned and sanitized. My sales person was informative, patience, and thorough with my purchase, as  was the cashier.  I would definitely return to make future purchases.  My furniture Will arrive within 6 to 8 weeks and am excited.  My previous buy was a kitchen that I absolutely love.  Good job guys.<//review>< Date>

Update: the sale was the only thing that went right with this order.  Customer service has completed destroyed our positive image of Living Spaces.  Tl:dr - if you want to know what bad customer service is, get told they'll call you back, never get called, not get your issue resolved, go buy a custom couch from Living Spaces.

We were notified that our couch was ready for delivery but they couldn't locate 2 of the 3 pieces in their warehouse. So they were going to deliver one part of our couch, which we agreed to.   A few hours pass, my wife a hole underneath the couch and this wasn't acceptable.  That night we called customer service.  They said let's order you an exchange. But wait, the fabric for your couch is out of stock. We asked can you just replace the bottom fabric which is standard on all couches, so we don't have to wait again?  They said warranty department will contact within 48 hours, which did not happen.  We ended up calling a week later to customer service for an update.  The service rep said we should have accepted delivery because most likely our damaged portion of the couch has been sold at the store on clearance, this is why I was trying to talk to them asap. then we explained our situation and she said she would contact the warehouse, which apparently she couldn't get a hold of anyone.  This would happen several more times during this horrible experience, as no one in the warehouse picks a phone up.  then she tells us that it's most likely that it hasn't been sold even though she told us it already has been sold probably.  She said she would get back to us Monday as it was late Friday.

We did not get a call on Monday.  So we gave her some time and then we called on Wednesday and no one picked up, we left a voicemail.  And did so again the same day, no response, no answer.  We called Friday morning, no answer, left another voicemail.  We called the mainline to find another person and got another person who contacted our original point of contact, strange.  She picked up her call but none of ours.  Nice job customer service. She then told us that they couldn't get a hold of the warehouse and suggested that we just reorder the couch. We do not want to wait another 2+ months for the fabric to be in stock and for the couch to be re-made. My wife said "how can you not get a hold of an entire warehouse of employees that work for your company?!? That is utterly ridiculous and an unacceptable excuse. There has to be a way of contacting them. How about a manager or something? I work at a law firm, what if I told a client that I can't get a hold of the attorney and you should appear in court on your own? That would not fly at any business." She finally put in a request for a manager to contact me back within 24 hrs. Which again did not happen. Although we received an email stating that our couch was ready for delivery. So still no call back but I guess they miraculously managed to get a hold of the warehouse. Couch finally arrives today and there is a piece of fabric glued on over the hole. They did not replace the whole piece, did not ask me if this was acceptable. So I paid full price for a "refurbished" piece. Which the glued on piece is actually already falling off before they brought it in the door. Will call them again in the morning, because we were told to accept delivery and they would repair it in home.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

They have a huge inventory to look over. I bought a sectional I can’t wait for its delivery. Service from the sales staff was excellent. The Millbrae store took careful steps to help curb COVID-19. Thank you!<//review>

I purchased a couple of Zachery Leather Power Wallaway Recliner ($937.97 each) with a 5-year warranty service. When one of the recliner stopped working, I reported it on August 17. A technician was sent to my home 23 days later and confirmed the motor to be replaced. Middle of September, however, a bulky wrong ‘chair part’ was delivered and the Warranty Service sent me an email saying they had placed a new order of the ‘right part’ on Oct. 1.

If the part arrives in 12 weeks, and another 3 weeks  to get the motor replaced, it will be middle of January next year, a whooping FIVE MONTHS after the claim was filed.

Be aware of the warranty service on items Living Spaces sells. They are dragging their feet and numerous calls have fallen to deaf ears. I spent over 30 hours to get the warranty service on repair, speaking to a host of incompetent and ill-trained reps including a couple of supervisors who lacked ‘due diligence’ could not get the store to respond.

Finally after three months of nonsense, I had to revisit the store where a possible replacement could be found. None found. Then Living Spaces informed me the motor order is not possible and with no replacement piece available, the case is closed. What a deceptive practice they are engaged in. I regret I did purchase over $12,000 furniture at Living Spaces, a third party hodge-podge line of furniture seller, rather than from Ethan Allen or Drexel who have been kept their reputation on other pieces we own.

Be aware of Living Spaces. They are eager to sell but from the moment the sales are done, you will not be able to get any after service. Numerous careless delivery of furniture with the worthless and deceptive warranty service were their hallmark!

(Update after an owner response)
The response did not go anywhere to our satisfaction. At best it was a deceitful camouflage! After 167 days passed from the date of repair was requested, Living Spaces said the case is closed without any compensation.<//Text>

will never shop here again, have very little actually in stock - waited over two weeks for a coffee table (was not notified it would be delayed, I had to call to find out) that come to find out was broken during transit so was not able to pick up after all. Things happen, I get that, my issue is the lack of proactive customer service and how every time you call you have to wait 40 minutes to speak with someone (no one ever leaves direct numbers you can contact back on). Note to Living Spaces: if you sell items online to people, actually have them availble with clear delivery timelines and customer service in hand for when those timelines are not met - I've now wasted 2 hours on the phone and over 2 weeks of my life on an item I don't even have (asked for a refund as all the other options were also not immediately available....)</text>

Living Space needs to improve quality control inspection and more importantly your after purchase customer service experience.

I will not be returning as a Living Spaces customer.

Randall Venerable

To be clear, I had a good in-store customer service experience.

Unfortunately I had a very poor post product purchase and customer service experience.

A management review of my transaction and multiple calls to customer service record, will help explain my decision never do business with Living Spaces again.

"In a recent study, 95% of respondents said they usually tell at least one other person about a bad customer experiences with a company."

This company is bringing us to tears. Bed delivered missing a section and broken side table. A month later and many hours on the phone with multiple people at corporate office and still not resolved. No apology, no one seems to care. Caveat emptor.< /Review>

Came here on a Sunday afternoon with my parents to view some reclining couches. I was greeted by Garcia while looking around, and he spent a good amount of time showing us around the different options they offered as we tried them out. He was very knowledgeable in the products, and very patient as we discussed amongst ourselves and weighed the pros and cons of each set up. There was never any pressure to buy anything which we appreciated.

We ended up purchasing a couch that visit and look forward to getting it delivered! I would not hesitate to purchase furniture from Living Spaces in the future.</review>

I was finally able to make up my mind about what I wanted in my house when I saw what Living Spaces had to offer. Also, the customer service was phenomenal! I will definitely be going back soon!

<text>My experience with my order is extremely terrible. If you don't want to waste time on waiting for your furniture, please don't come here.

I ordered four dining chairs at this location on July 27. The associate on site promised they would be ready for pick up on August 7. As of today (August 18), my chairs are still not ready for pick up. Everytime when I called the store, I had to wait for approximately an hour to speak with someone and was always given a new date for pickup. Yet, the chair just never arrived on the dates they gave to me.

It's just super disappointing.<//text>< pictures>

I was very satisfied with my shopping experience here. It was my first time visiting a Living Spaces so I didn’t know what to expect. Upon entering we were greeted and the employee explained the layout of the store and what we could find on each floor. Garrick and Dennis were the associates I interacted with the most and they were excellent. Real people people and I appreciated that. And from what I could tell, all of the associates were very friendly and seemed happy to be at work 😄<//text>

Awesome collection. Slightly overpriced but home decor items (except furnitures) are pretty reasonable.
However, home delivery service sucks especially packaging and handling of the furniture. They charge you extra if you’re living above 3rd floor (which was a new information to us).

No communication. Product was out of stock and I was not told. Arranged to pickup and was told it wouldn’t arrive until days after scheduled. Had already arranged for a truck for pickup and everything. Never received my receipt or notification of delay. No attempt to correct the issue even when product arrived to them I was told it would be days until available</review>

We had a decent experience at living spaces, we purchased a large sectional, leather chair and ottoman and coffee table a little less than a year and a half ago. While both the chair and coffee table have held up nicely, the couch becomes increasingly more uncomfortable over time. The couch we tested in the store was incredibly comfortable, like sitting on a cloud. Ours is definitely not. For what we paid, I would not recommend spending a ton on a couch from LS.<//Text>

I would give a better rating. They obviously judge my wife and I buy how we looked. They did know we're new money. They kept following us around it was a obvious. They told us that they were closing soon. Said they about  an hour. We decided to buy some furniture and it funny how there attitude changed. All of a sudden they and coffee or water for us. We spent over 5 racks there. Their furniture is great. It's the customer service that sucked.<//Review>

I love this store. Have purchased several items here. Cabria was my salesperson... she was awesome! My only complaint, is that you do not offer same day delivery as advertised. Each time I had to wait two weeks or more for delivery of my items.< /review>

DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY. You'll go to the store, they won't have in stock what you like. When you finally find something that is supposedly in stock, they won't deliver on the promised date, and will reschedule it for the next 15 days. They didn't deliver the queen bed I bought and one of the movers broke one of the pieces of another product. Final result: I don't have the products I paid for, they will be delivered 14 days later than promised, and they didn't compensate me for this freaking mess in any way.< /Review>

I came in because I had bought a sofa here two years ago with a five year warranty. The sofa’s frame was warped and the warranty company agreed to replace the sofa.

Upon arriving at the store, the employees were courteous and agreed to provide store credit on the entire amount I paid for my original sofa. They also provided insight on the different types of sofas, which helped me make the decision in choosing my replacement.

Delivery was incredibly quick. I signed up for delivery from 12 pm-6 pm. The delivery team showed up at 12:40 pm and finished by 1 pm. Very satisfied!</text>

Not a ding on the Millbrae location, some of the most helpful people work here. This review is about the company.
It's been more than 3 weeks since we ordered a dining table. It's been stuck in some online-order-warehouse-delivery black hole. Please fix your online ordering + customer support + order tracking + communications.
On a serious note - this would have been a start of a long term relationship furnishing our new place. Oh well....< /Text>

DO NOT BUY FURNITURE FROM HERE!!

You will get a phone call the night before your furniture arrives letting you know that your items are back ordered until an undetermined date.  Save your time and spend a little extra cash and go elsewhere.</text>

<Text>I have to say, I was excited when I first bought my bedroom set - until - my bed broke randomly.  Figuring I had the VIP protection plan, I thought I was covered.  This experience has been almost 2 moths without a bed, sleeping on the floor - and I still haven't received my replacement.  I will not be buying future furniture from here.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Don't buy from this store! The store associate didn't know what they were talking about. We purchased a bed frame to match with the mattress we have and before we made the purchase, we tripled checked with the associate there about the height of the bed frame and he assured us it wouldn't be more 26" with the mattress and baseboard we have. But when the bed frame was delivered. It was a lot highter than what he informed us. With our mattress, it's almost 30", which didn't work. We called the store to try to figure out a solution, the store manager was super rude and disrepectful, he didn't even let us talk and blamed us for not purchasing the mattress from them, which was not even the issue here. He refused to provide any solution and told us we have to pay 10% restocking fee for return. What kind of store does that? The worst customer experience ever ! This is not how a company should treat its customer and it's such a shame that a person with no customer service skill and no manner was put to a store manager position. I am not ever going back to this store again. Living space should provide better traning on their manager for customer service and also better training to sales associate for not providing false information.< /Text>< Date>

Very helpful and friendly staff as soon as you enter. My husband and I are very happy with all our furniture pieces we purchased so far. Delivery crew was just as helpful and professional. Just wish they offered synchrony Canadian department like some of their competitors for payment plans. We just moved here from Canada for a job at Google/YouTube. We've got excellent Canadian credit history, which counts for nothing here (different systems). We're in the process of building our US credit history as we just moved. Unfortunately we were not eligible for their no interest payment plan so we wound up opting for a matress at a different store, Mancini's sleep world, where they also have synchrony payment plans, but the manager here was able to set it up through the Canadian department so they could pull our files/credit and approve us. That was about the only thing that disappointed us at living spaces and held us back from giving it a full 5 stars; aside from that, it's a great store and I'll probably be back again with my husband. Thumbs up.< /review>< pictures>

I came in to look at a dining table I saw online, and Nick helped me evaluate several options for chairs to go with it. He was great, I never felt pressure to buy anything.

Knowledgeable about their furniture products, fabrics and colors. This was a Friday afternoon around 4:00 p.m. We we're pleased with Mickey's help, since we had previously narrowed our choice on the website, and will definitely return to place our order.<//review><UserId.>104399059524799007909</UserId.><Rating>5</Rating><gmap_id>0x808f77a1678891a1:0x74eb19665871281f</gmap_id>< response>

<Review>Narmin greeted us with a smile, answered all of our questions and most of all she built rapport along the way. She asked questions to get to know what we were looking for and learned that we got married a year ago and she congratulated us on our 1 year anniversary and let us know she would be there to help if we had any follow-up questions. We were delighted that she was there to answer furniture questions to help with our decision and she treated us like people she was getting to know and share her knowledge and furniture experience, which made the experience seamless. My husband said that was so easy no sales pitches and we got exactly what we wanted within an hour. Thanks Narmin keep up the good work!</Review>< Response>

I'm looking for a coffee table.  The sales people are not on commission and you can really wander around and have no one approach you.  I wanted something specific so it was a frustrating experience.  If you like to shop you might find this appealing.
Have found that most of the furniture sold in this price range advertised as solid wood furniture actually has a wood veneer top.  These wood veneer tops DO NOT look at all like real wood, IMHO.
This happens at Wayfair, Joss and Main, and others in this price category.  When did this happen!?
Found nothing here that had a real wood surface so couldn't find what I want.< /Text>

<Review>My husband and I spent a couple of hours looking at rugs and furniture at the Living Spaces floor room in Milbrae. We bought our couch from them a few years ago and are moving to a space that needs rugs. We went with some ideas in mind, but left with a whole new plan thanks to the wonderful staff. Kabria helped us look up numerous rug options and find things in our color scheme. Kayla took us all around the showroom to compare our couch to the various rugs we were interested in and helped us think about our specific space and what we could do to bring out the design feeling we were going for. Although we waited to make a purchase until closer to our move date, we found a rug we love thanks to their help.

We are always impressed with the customer service and quality offered by living spaces and will be return customers.<//Review>< Pics>

I had a wonderful experience at Living Spaces today. I’ve been furniture-shopping for a while now but I wasn’t satisfied with anything I saw on the market. When I went to Living Spaces I was impressed with the designs, quality, and prices of their pieces. Everyone was welcoming and helpful, particularly Yasmeen, Pierce, and John! Thanks for a great experience. I look forward to receiving my furniture.</review>

< review>
The buying experience was nice, but the sofa broke in 6 months with normal usage. The salesman did seem a bit pushy in the future if I have to buy furniture I would probably avoid this store. While the look and feel of the furniture is pretty great and prices are reasonable I feel like durability is not as great as I mentioned above.<//review>

<Text>DISHONEST business practices. The sales rep Ooh-mit told us a sofa was in stock and ready to ship within 2 week time frame. I followed up a couple days later and was told that it was out of stock and not available until after 4 weeks. They won't even guarantee that the sofa would be ready to ship after 4 weeks which means the ship date could be pushed back further. The only option to resolve this problem was to offer a full refund which means there is no incentive for them to accommodate customers and go out of the way to help them.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I had a most relaxing experience this evening at Living Spaces!  I had already chosen the couch I wanted earlier in the week and was now ready to make the purchase. Alex greeted me at the front door and very quickly led me through fabric and color choices. Explained to me the delivery process and we finished up my purchase efficiently.  I was very happy with the whole process, Alex was very friendly and professional.  I will be back when I’m ready for a dining set and be asking for him to assist me.<//text>< name>

I just purchased a lift-top coffee table after purchasing my leather reclining sectional from Living Spaces a month ago. We love our couch. It’s so comfy and soft and had great service all the way through and therefore it was a no brainer to go back for the coffee table. Can’t wait to get it!</Review>

<text>Same day delivery as advertised online is not true. I was told that’s only in certain locations and only in Los Angeles. So after agreeing to another day I was told the earliest I could receive the furniture was 5 days later. Not even close to same day delivery. Therefore, I ordered a truck to pick up the furniture which all of it did not fit (I take credit for that). So now I’m getting a second truck to complete this order.<//text>< resp>

Ken was patient, knowledgeable and helpful. I had stopped in the store a couple of time looking and price comparing and several of your sale associates didn't have any interest in answering question because I was not purchasing at that time. Then I met ken and he was great and took the time needed for me to make a decision.</Text>

I ordered a few pieces from their website and asked for delivery. My home does not have elevator. When delivery people came here they told me they can take it up only to the second floor. They contact tells them only two runs of stairs. I asked them to deliver them all or I refuse to accept anything. And they left. I called customer service. They told me they call me to reschedule the delivery. But after the times calling them nothing has happened.
They ruined my whole plans for my weekend, and now I have to pay then extra money for redelivery. Just for the record, I had other pieces delivered from Ikea and was so smooth and painless. Avoid living spaces if you can. They are already overpriced and they have no care for customers.</text>

<Review>Living Spaces was great.  Very helpful salespeople like Narim who are not commission makes for a more chill shopping experience. Great options too.  And since they’re furniture is made in California, their sofas don’t have the toxic flame retardants added into the foam padding.<//Review><user_name>Donald Simon<//user_name>< user>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Purchased a chair on 8/21/19.  It was supposed to be delivered by Sept. 15.  Somehow it got to the Millbrae store and was turned around back to Los Angeles.  I made many phone calls back to the store and was promised it would be delivered on 9/29.  I called yesterday and was NOW told it was still in production and no delivery date was known.  I was told I would get a call back yesterday and no phone call was received.  Terrible customer service.  They are very good at sales but not good with follow up.  When you try and call anyone you are on hold for at least 7 or 8 minutes before you can get to speak to a live person.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808f77a1678891a1:0x74eb19665871281f< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I previously had a negative experience at a Living Spaces store. But I figured I’d give them one more chance. Tyler Johnson was the BEST salesperson ever!!!!  I bought 2 rugs and a storage chest. He was fantastic!  So helpful and great suggestions!!!<//Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>1.waited 3 week for a custom color couch only to have a stock couch delivered ( which could have been delivered the day of purchase).come to find out that the cashier entered the wrong data.
2. my wife told the delivery drivers that this wasn't the couch we ordered and to take it back. they told her to call customer service and left the couch. we were told to not damage or stain the couch until they could pick it up on Saturday.
3. the window of pick up was 12am to 6pm with a follow up call to give us a shorter time frame. waste and entire day only to find out it wasn't scheduled at all.
4. finally schedule a pickup for Sunday from 3pm to 6pm. get home at 2:45pm to find that they have been waiting for us. driver gave us attitude about waiting and I almost lost my $h!7. he upset my wife and clearly didn't want to be there.
the complete lack of customer service and professionalism is appalling.  I have made a huge mistake purchasing from this company and still waiting the 3 to 4 weeks  for the actual couch we had purchased to show up

contacted the social media department, asked for my info, gave it to them and i am still wait for my couch. nothing has been done and it doesn't seem like anything will. It feels like the company is ok with one dissatisfied customer, that they are a big company and is ok if one out of many slips past.  I've never felt so helpless with such a situation.  I even walked into the store only to find out the salesman, who was the only saving grace, was the one who made the original mistake.  I WAS COMPLETELY SCREWED FROM THE START, and all I'm getting is " we're sorry, we'll do our best to get your couch ". it's been 2 weeks past the original delivery date, and I don't forsee and extra hustle for living spaces. I absolutely believe I made a mistake purchasing from this company. I bought the couch mid September and I've been giving a first 2 weeks in NOVEMBER completion date not delivery date.  NOVEMBER!!!!!!</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1571158834447, 'text': 'We are so sorry to hear this has taken place, and will be sharing this feedback with management.

Great customer service. Upon entering we were greeted, asked for what we were looking for and directed to the proper area. When we got there the sales rep met us right away, showed us what we were looking for, checked all our options and available colors. Needless to say we walked out with a purchase.< /review>

<review>This is a great place to sit on couches and check out furniture that you'd ordinarily buy online. Living Spaces has an extremely extensive collection of furniture online, but I was always curious about the quality. It's great to be able to sit, feel, and lift the different pieces.

I found a number of items I was excited about. You can also then purchase online so it will be delivered to your home. I really liked this store.

My one complaint: I really wish they did more staging so I could get more ideas and creative pairings. It is hard to envision things like which coffee tables and rugs go with which couches and chairs. They put safe/boring options together. Give me ideas!!<//review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Time>

Loved this store! Gabe and Anna were so helpful and nice and professional! This store was new to me as I was waiting for traffic to slow down on trip home but I was lucky to find this store as it had everything I needed for my home. Beautiful sectional and dining table and coffee and end tables plus they had nice accessories like a classy lamp a nice Jute vase and a Buddha statue that looks beautiful in my home. Living spaces had everything you need and the Cherry on top was that they delivered to Lodi for $129 AND set up furniture. I couldn't believe how Lucky I was!! Highly recommend this store to everyone. Happy shopping.< /Review>

Makinsen was a tremendous help when we stopped in to look at furniture for our new apartment.  He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and funny as well.  He showed us several options similar to what we were looking at to help us make up our minds.
He patiently waited while we talked it over and patiently explained their process twice since my partner didn't quite understand the first time.
Great experience! I highly recommend.<//Text>

No over selling and showed us exactly what we wanted with pros and cons for each. We told him our budget and we got everything we wanted with $10 to spare.

My husband and I visited Living Spaces several times before pulling the trigger on our purchases. Each and every time we came by, the Friendly Furniture Finders were extremely friendly, patient, helpful, and never ever pushy. We are very happy with our purchases and our experience with Living Spaces!< /Text>

Phenomenal experience head to toe. Really great selection of furniture, reasonable prices, and accommodating system for picking up or having it delivered.

The sales team is mixed (the door greeters are overly aggressive) but we were able to find helpful non-pushy ones each time we visited.

Will continue to go back here for all our furniture needs.<//text>

We ended up buying a huge sectional and it was easy, fun, and exciting. By the end of the purchase we had made a new friend. Brandon was amazing! The store is amazing.

<Review>Pierce was very helpful with us purchasing a new bedroom set for our daughter.  I never felt pressured into purchasing more than I envisioned.  In addition, I wanted to wait for the delivery before writing this review.  The delivery men arrived with the 3 hour window that was set and the delivery link to my phone was a great feature.< /Review>< Rating>

Great experience shopping here. So many options to choose from either couches, chairs rugs etc. The employees especially Narmin and John were very helpful in our effort to purchase a couch. They didn't pressure us at all into buying anything and accommodated us to no end. Highly recommend this place.<//review>

I just discovered this furniture store and absolutely love it.  They have a large inventory and are very reasonably priced without sacrificing on quality.  But what makes them standout far above any other store I've been to in years is their customer service.  They really value you as a customer and it shows.  Everyone is so friendly and accommodating.  They don't work on commission so they aren't pushy at all, but somehow they are still motivated to help you in any possible way they can.  Today my salesperson, Alexander, was incredible! I only had a general idea of what I wanted and he walked me through all options of color, fabric and styles patiently eliminating what I don't like and narrowing in on what I do like.  He was super knowledgeable about the store products and an expert in color coordination, which is an underrated trait.  He made helpful suggestions while keeping my preferences in mind.   He definitely caught onto my taste even though I can't really define it myself.  When I struggled with decisions, he knew exactly what to ask and/or show me to help me make choices. I felt like he truly cared about finding what would really make me happy and excited.  It seems like he enjoys the process, which made it fun too! A sales manager, Josh, checked in and was also remarkably friendly and helpful.  I really can't emphasize enough how courteous the staff is.  I will definitely be back and recommending all my friends and family check them out as well.<//review>

<text>The service I received from Zeta was stellar — she asked great questions, listened to my preferences, and directed me to a couple of sectional sofa options, ultimately choosing and purchasing one. She also brought in a colleague to discuss with me  my concerns about delivery and the sofa being moved into my building without an issue. I will recommend Living Spaces and the Millbrae showroom to friends and colleagues.</text>< name>

On Sunday it was very crowded but the first impression was good. The moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly, then I was given instructions to find the items that I found online. I was given the space and time to try things, but sale associates would periodically check in to see if I needed help. I made my purchase on my 2nd trip after settling with my final purchase decision.

I like their product and the care free option which was an amazing insurance on furniture! Now I will wait and see how long my back ordered sectional will take to get to my house.</review>< resp>

Black Friday shopping is something I usually avoid like the plague but the deal Living Spaces offered was too good to pass up. I needed a dining room set and found exactly what I was looking for at well below the price I was prepared to spend.  Customer service was excellent and i was in and out in about twenty minutes. 10/10 will shop again.<//text>

We went in looking for a loft bed with a twin size underneath for our boys. We had already gone to another Living Spaces store that the website claimed had the specific bed on display and the second LS store didn't have it either! We were greeted by Gabe who walked us us throughout our mission to determine a comparable model with height measurements. We ended up buying the bed I saw online and it was all in thanks to him taking the time to see similar heights of other beds. He didn't pressure us into making a sale and let us decide what worked best for our family.<//Text>

<Text>I just had the most wonderful experience shopping at lLiving Spaces  and it was all because of a young man named Alexander Rivera!   Thank goodness I met Alexander because he was expertise in knowing the inventory and just happened to be a designer and new all the color combinations. He worked with me for over two hours and never complain. Alexander didn’t even have a lunch or dinner break. I found  The most beautiful furniture for my new house and it’s all because of Alexander’s help. I will definitely be coming back to living Spaces to complete  furnishing the rest of my new home. Your prices were amazing!  Yeah Alexander!!!!!  And thank you so much!🤗< /Text><Time>1512784003593< /Time><rate>5< /rate>< user_name>

Sorry this is long, but I hope helpful to some of you:

I went into this Living Spaces store and ordered two pieces -- a lamp and a TV stand -- to be delivered the following Tuesday. They have very broad delivery windows -- they won't be more specific than a 6 hour window when you book, and then they narrow it down to a still pretty broad 3 hour window the day before. I live on a narrow street in San Francisco, and so needed a small truck for the delivery, which was notated on the paperwork and in their system.

I need to be at work on Tuesday, but my Mom graciously agrees to wait at my place to take the delivery. They call me during my delivery window to tell me that even though the notes say they need a small truck, they didn't bring a small truck. Therefore they are unable to deliver the items that day. My Mom winds up waiting around my place for no reason. When they call, I ask when they can reschedule for, and they tell me they are a 3rd party contracted by Living Spaces and cannot help me with anything.

I call in and the first rep I speak with starts arguing with me about how it's not noted in the system that a small truck is needed. (It clearly was, I saw them do it when I was in the store, and it's on my paperwork.) She is so argumentative that she starts to get me agitated. I request a manager call back, which never happens.

I do get a call back from a non-manager to try and get me back on schedule. I agree to schedule for Saturday so I can be home to take delivery. They call me on Friday to tell me that they've misplaced the items -- items that were on their truck on Tuesday! They say they will keep looking for them and give me a call back one way or the other to let me know if they will be able to deliver. They never call. I call them Saturday morning and they still haven't located the items and can't make the delivery.

They call me back once again to try and reschedule. I tell them that I'm going to be out of town the next few weekends and at work during the week. In order to deliver, they will need to schedule me either first stop in the morning or in the early evening so I can meet them either before or after work. The person I speak with is understanding, and agrees that given that this is the 3rd time they are trying to deliver, they will go out of their way to make sure I'm first stop Thursday morning. He takes the time to talk to their dispatch supervisor to make sure this can be done.

I receive an email Wednesday saying that I'm now the 3rd stop, and scheduled for the middle of the day. I call in, get transferred to a supervisor, and am told that there's no way I can be the first stop. It does not work with their routing and not even the supervisor can control the routing. I tell the supervisor straight out that I'm not going to attempt a 4th delivery, and that they either hold up their promise for first stop Thursday or cancel my order. She cancels my order rather than accommodate me. This whole episode leaves me frustrated and angry. Not only are their operations horrible, but they just don't seem to care.

Reviews:
In-store experience: B+. I actually thought their store was nice and that their sales rep was helpful. I had to deal with a bad sales rep before I got a good one though.

Customer service experience: D. I spoke with one agent who was decent, but most just don't seem to care at all. Additionally, none of them seem to be empowered to help the customer in any way.

Delivery experience: F. They didn't read their notes about the small truck, and they misplaced my items when trying to deliver them the second time. They then decided not to accommodate me with the first stop even though it was noted. I know this is a third party contracted by Living Spaces, and if I were them I'd fire them and hire someone else.

Furniture: N/A. Never actually got my furniture because the other experiences were so bad.< /Text>

<text>This is our first time visiting the store, my wife and I so surprised how nice and organized they are.
Now come to the best part, we are looking for sofa bed and end it up buying set of mattress with complete set( head board and etc)
It took so many time back and force on making decisions. My God, I just don't believe service and kindness of the staff we received, most definitely I will recommend to friends.
Thank you guys and keep good work 👍👍👍<//text>< Pics>

I would recommend Living Spaces in Milbrae to anyone looking for a new bed  , my salesperson Makenzie was very knowledgeable on all the different brands. I felt no pressure and was not hurried in making my decision which took a half hour after the store was closed! My new Revive copper plush is being delivered tomorrow and I cannot wait to get a great night's sleep.<//text>

<Review>Friendly staff, we went in knowing what we wanted and they helped facilitate the buying process super smoothly. Warning that the credit for the Care-Free Protection Plan has an expiration date of 60days after the 5year plan is done, they didn't tell us about that when we bought it. But I think we still would have purchased the plan regardless, just would have been nice to know up front.<//Review>< date>

Gabe was the sales associate who helped us and he was phenomenal! He worked with us on all the dimensions of our new sectional and gave us different ideas on how to move it. The best thing about this place is they don't work on commission so they aren't like vultures . Very impressed!!<//text>

We both a sectional sofa at this store in Millbrae and the Sofa in the middle is bad , when you sit down you go all the inside the sofa, it’s giving us back pain, my wife the store to see if could exchange the sofa for a different one and the person was super RUDE with my, we pay for insurance on the sofa and everything and both other stuff in that store, looks like when you to buy something they super nice but if you any problem with their product they are super nasty, if I could give ZERO STARS that would be more appropriate. I’m super upset with them!< /review>

Living Spaces is in my own opinion a one stop shop for all things furnitures. We purchased a love seat couch, accent chair and bench with storage. In addition, you get friendly and helpful service from the sales staff with zero pressure to have you buy an item.<//text>

I'm only giving Living Spaces two stars because the staff in the store were really helpful and generally pleasant. I bought a sofa and noticed there was damage to the frame the night it was delivered. Getting customer service to help by replacing the sofa or give me a refund has been a disaster. It's been nearly a month and I don't feel I am close at all to a resolution.< /review>

If you're just picking things up in the store you should be fine.

If however, you're ordering ANYTHING online or not currently in the store, STAY AWAY. Living Spaces has DISAPPOINTED us at EVERY CONCEIVABLE OPPORTUNITY when we attempted to purchase a couch as well as a rug.

When we attempted to order a couch:
Oh boy, where should I start.
- we find a couch we like in the store
- we find out the fabric that we picked out is not and will never be available again. ok, we'll pick the default fabric
- we find out that the default fabric is out of stock as well, but am given the email address of another employee (Samuel L.) who will contact us when it becomes available. sounds good
- 1 week later, I email said employee and the email bounces. I was able to email the same address last week. Ok, that's annoying. I call in, ask for this employee, and am told that he'll call us back today.
- Spoiler alert: that didn't happen. Weeks later, I call HQ to see if we can order the couch. It's out of stock. I verify the SKUs, and find out that the salesman that we spoke to ADDED THE WRONG COUCH (mirror orientation) to the order, despite circling the correct items on the order form that we SIGNED IN THE STORE.
- During this call with a woman from HQ (should've gotten a name) she said she'd 'take this on as a personal project' and ensure we find the right couch for us. She ensured us that she'd reach out by the end of the week.
- 3 weeks later: no response.

When we attempted to order a rug:
We tried to add a rug to an existing order (to save on shipping costs) but were told that even though the site said the item was available, it was in fact not available. This was a lie, since we were able to order that same item before it was restocked. Because of this we had to pay extra for the shipping fee.<//review>

<Text>Wow! Talk about great customer service! I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door and directed to a very helpful sales associate, Ozzy. Ozzy found be exact dresser I was looking for and had Sam, a store designer, finish out the sale. Sam was very helpful, finished the transaction for me, and provided me with the information to pick up my furniture on Fremont.
When I got the dresser home, I was very bummed to see that one of the legs was broken. I took it back to the Burlingame store and Wilmer was more than helpful at accepting the return, unloading it from my car, issuing me a refund, and giving me a 10% discount for all my trouble! He was so helpful and nice— a very welcomed attitude after a day of running around the Bay Area! Thank you Wilmer, Sam, and Ozzy!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I spent $1200 for a bar table, stools and a rug. I love the quality of the furniture and the shipping and assembly were quick and effortless. The sales people on the other hand... Ugh.

Have you seen the movie "It Follows" ? It was like that. I can't even go there without a solid escape plan. They need to back off and let people actually look at the furniture.

I was bombarded with the same sales pitch 3 times about how they copy restoration hardware designs or whatever. I don't care. I didn't care the first time.< /text>

<Review>Shopped at the Millbrae store. Gabe was very personable, helpful, fun and pleasant to work with. My only complaint is that there seems to be only one color of any particular item in stock. I needed a sofa bed by a specific date so had to settle for the stock color.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Living Spaces Millbrae has unprecedented customer service and a warm environment that made furnishing my new appartment easy and stress free. Chante, who helped me out, went above and beyond the call to action in providing my service. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for home furnishings or furniture.< /Text>

Our Sales Associate Ken at the Milbrae store where we bought our furniture was AWESOME!  We had  been there multiple times trying to decide on which furniture to buy. Every time we went there he helped us. When we went back to finally purchased the items we made sure to ask for Ken. He is very courteous, patient and knowledgeable of all items in the store.  We purchased a special order sectional, 3 dressers, 4 nightstands, a large area rug and a huge mirror.   I would absolutely recommend Ken as your Sales Associate at the Milbrae location.   Thank you Living Spaces and Ken for a easy and wonderful furniture buying experience.</Text>

I highly doubt if they can keep their business forever with this narrow-mindedness. The other day when my husband and I just went through the building, a staff member stopped us and asked us to go around the building. Isn't the fact of even going through the building will increase the chance of us buying furnitures? We actually set our mind on a bed frame, but now we don't want to step in the store anymore.</Text>

I’m not sure why the sales associate told us 2-3 weeks for our special order, but when I called after 2 weeks I was told 4-5 weeks. The associates may say they don’t work on commission but they sure know how to hustle. They’re very thorough, but that can make the checkout process unnecessarily long.< /review>

Outstanding customer service!

I havent had a purchase experience like this in a long time. The representatives were very attentive but provided ample space for you to shop and browse with absolutely no pressure and were close enough to be able to answer questions if needed.
Our sales rep stayed with us the entire time all the way up to the completion of purchase. If they needed to switch representitives, the walked them over and made formal introductions.

Living Spaces gives me hope that customer service does in fact still exist!< /text>

Prices, quality and selection are exceptional. All of the employees were extremely helpful. Umit was right by our side ready to answer any questions we had. At the same time he gave us our space and was not hovering or pushy. I couldnt ask for better customer service. We didnt feel rushed or pressured in anyway.

Denis was also very helpful with the finanacing process. Quick and easy. Everyone is kind and professional.

I would absolutely recommend this store.</text>

We were very excited to buy the Aiden sofa from Living Spaces and have had it for less than 8 months before it broke! Note that no one was sitting on it when it just made a thud noise and gave away and the two wood pieces at the bottom just came to the floor.

We suspect that it was always damaged at the bottom as it had two humps hanging but didn't think much of it until now. We have had furniture from Ashley Furniture and Ikea for years without any issue. We are super disappointed with Living Spaces quality.

Living Spaces Warranty claim process is a joke as they charge you $99 just for someone to come take a look at what needs fixing and then $50/hour to fix a bad product they built!

STAY AWAY!!! DO NOT BUY!!! We have definitely learned our lesson and will not be shopping here ever again.< /review>

<text>We had a very pleasant shopping experience in LivingSpaces today.  The selection was excellent and the prices reasonable.  We also shopped at Laz-Boy (spelling??) their selection and quality did not match LivingSpaces'.  We ended up buying our chair from Garcia at LS, a friendly, well informed  and non- pushy sales person, the kind we like.</text>< username>

Everyone was very helpful. I was impressed with the wide variety of furniture and such. The only dispoonting thing was, we bought chairs and they were on backorder. I understand that it takes a while for things to come in, but no one called or let us know about what we ordered. It was almost over a month. So, I had to call and check on my order. They told me it would take 3-4 weeks because they didn’t know when it would come in.  It would’ve been nice to know that sooner. So, I cancelled my order.  I really liked the chairs, but couldn’t wait any longer.< /text>

The service was great. The GM of the Millbrae store is a huge asset! I’m used to the ikea type of places so I was pleasantly surprised by how many ppl were eager to help me here. Good prices too.< /Text>

< Review>
Alexander at Living Social in the Millbrae, CA location was very patient and professional in helping us finalize the selection and design of the Aspen sectional sofa with foldout twin bed, the fabric color, and pillow patterns. We brought a carpet sample and living room layout floorplan to work from. Decided not to go with the additional 5 year Care Program that has a voucher for the full amount paid refunded if not used. There was no supporting written document to these terms and conditions in the sales contract or brochure.<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>Let me start by saying that the in store customer service was great! But unfortunately when our furniture was delivered we received a damaged dining room chair and the wrong couches, three weeks later we are still waiting on our replacement chair and just had the wrong couches picked up after having to jump thru hoops for them. Now they want us to pay another 49.99 to process our application again since we had to pick out a new couch because the one that we had originally purchased is not available! I'm sorry but I don't think it's right to pay them more money for something that they screwed up and have taken their sweet time to fix! Will not be going back to this store, if you want horrible customer service when you call then be my guest. Oh and be prepared to have the wrong stuff delivered and when you call them have someone on the other end line have 0 clue as to what's going on</review>< Pics>

Our first time at the Millbrae store and we had a very great experience! Once you walk inyoi are promptly greeted and people are very helpful and want to help. We worked with Mikie ( I hope that’s spelled correctly) and he was amazing! Above and beyond service. Hoping our new furniture will be as great.</text>

Why only 3 stars? I had a Chinese guy salesman follow me up the stairs to the 3rd floor, ask me if I needed help. I said no thank you and as I walked around the 3rd floor, he kept following me. As if things couldn't get more weird, he followed me down to the 2nd Floor all round the whole showroom floor and that's when I said forget it I'm outta here. This store has a lot of good stuff. I'll probably be back someday but this was not a good start.</review>

< Review>
One of the most ridiculous delivery experiences I've ever had. Which is a shame, because the in-store staff was helpful and the furniture itself seems nice.

I ordered a credenza on a Saturday, scheduled for delivery on Sunday morning. The delivery truck arrived Sunday with the wrong piece, so I sent it back and called to see when they could deliver the correct piece.  Twice I was told I'd receive a call from a manager which never came, and had to call back myself instead.

I was told by the first manager that I could get on the first delivery window for the next day (Monday), but then later a different manager told me I was on a later delivery window and that there was "nothing they could do" to affect who got on what delivery window or in what order.

I understand that trucks have to routed efficiently, and I understand why large delivery windows have to be given to account for variable delivery times. But when you've already screwed up by delivering the wrong piece, and are now forcing me to stay home from work on a Monday due to an error on your part, I would expect that they'd make some sort of effort to be accommodating. Instead it was literally just to the back of the queue like any other order.

I should say they did eventually say they would send me a $100 gift card for the trouble, which isn't very useful since I don't plan on shopping here again.< /Review>

Would be zero stars, if possible.  Horrible, horrible experience. 4 months after they damaged my house making a delivery, they still haven't paid the settlement that they offered 2 months ago.  I have made numerous follow ups and go unanswered for weeks at a time.  The delivery people were rude, gruff, and lied about damaging the door even though my teen son and I saw them do it.  One item was flawed and had to be refused, and the replacement item was also flawed and couldn't be delivered.  Finally, on the 3rd try, they got it right.  This was a bedroom set.  I would never recommend LIving Spaces or anyone, or every buy from them again.</Review>

Neighbors of mine purchased some furniture from Living Spaces/Millbrae about 2 months ago. Since that time, I have been on the website, trying to determine what piece(s) I wanted for my apartment. I finally headed to the Millbrae store yesterday. I had the pleasure of meeting Gabe, who patiently showed me around. We discussed my small apartment space, fabrics, pieces, budget, and availability. In the end, I decided on a recliner and an accent chair; and I couldn’t be happier. I was waffling between chaise, loveseat with ottoman, and chairs. Gabe was a complete delite, walking me around the store – up- and down-stairs. He was very knowledgeable, and has a great design eye!! My furniture arrives in 2 days, and I have just completed shampooing the carpet in complete ecstasy as I wait!! Thank you again, Living Spaces!! And, special shout-out to Gabe (Fernando)!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The price is clearly stated, and there are changes in the payment. You need to pay for other items to maintain it. I also talk about the package delivery service, but it is not right. It was bought at the time. If it is not ordered, it will be delivered at your own expense.

(Original)
明明講好价格，付款時有變化，要付加其他物件才有保養其。又講好包送貨上門服務，但是又唔對現，是當時買就有，如果訂做就沒有，要自費送貨< /review>
