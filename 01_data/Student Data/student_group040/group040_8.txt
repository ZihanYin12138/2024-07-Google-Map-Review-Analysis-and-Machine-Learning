I highly recommend you getting your auto body repair here. Lance did an amazing job getting our brand new SUV fixed here and it looks amazing. Work was exceptional and Lance was really easy to talk to and he responded to all our concerns.< /Review>

He went out his was way, to take my Honda to nearby dealer for my scheduled oil change and tire rotation. Wow I’ve never experienced that before! He walked me to Enterprise’s rental office, wow I got a 2020 Mustang! I would definitely highly recommend Toyota Collision.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

They got me right in,  provided a rental car and drove me there to pick it up.  I was able to get in and out before heading to work for the day.  They kept me updated and my car was returned to me looking brand new. And they made sure to educate me on how this works for the life of my vehicle and to keep documents in my manual.  Rick Dougherty was awesome, the front desk person (I think Elias?) And everyone else that I worked with!

<review>Folsom Lake Toyota Collision Center was the perfect place to take my vehicle for repairs. Someone hit my bumper when my car was parked, and the whole bumper needed to be replaced. They did an excellent job, as well as touching up a few other little dings and a scratch, and my car looked beautiful when I got it back. The staff there were very attentive and very professional, most especially Lance, who took really good care of me and my vehicle. Elias was great as well. The communication was excellent. I felt very well taken care of by them. I highly recommend getting your vehicle repaired and restored at this facility.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1579283226201, 'text': 'We thank you for letting us repair your vehicle!

We had our 2010 Toyota Highlander Ltd repaired at Folsom Lake Toyota Collision Center. It had been in a minor accident and required a new front grill and bumper and related parts. The repairs took about a week. The car was restored to “like new “ condition. The paint matched perfectly. Everything was done as promised. No surprises. On time and at the price quoted. We were kept informed of the progress throughout. The body shop used new Toyota parts even though our insurance company only paid for after market parts. We were not charged a premium for this extra cost.
Couldn’t be more pleased with our experience. Very friendly staff. 5 Stars all the way.< /review>

for my Kia was less than some other independent centers.  Great job on both and my Kia was done sooner than promised.

I’ve worked with Jimmy for two repairs and he is awesome! Just the kind of old school customer service that seems so rare these days. On the second repair I didn’t even bother to shop around since I knew Jimmy would handle it quickly for a fair price and there would be no hassles. Toyota is lucky to have him!<//Review>

I had a great experience with Folsom Lake Toyota Collision Center. I was particularly impressed with Lance,  the service representative that assisted me throughout the entire process and I simply couldn't appreciate his expertise anymore.
Thank you Lance and Folsom Lake Toyota.
Sincerely, Bill Henderson< /Text>

I had minor damage to the left front of my Toyota Tacoma. After visiting two body shops I took it to Folsom Lake Toyota Collision  Center. Kara provided a prompt estimate to repair the  damage, which was the lowest of the three. The work was scheduled for the following week. I dropped the truck off on Tuesday morning and picked it up on Wednesday afternoon. It was a beautiful job, the truck looked like new again. The business was conducted in a professional, efficient and friendly manner  I highly recommend  Folsom Lake Toyota Collision  Center for your repairs.< /Text>

Class act body shop and repaired my truck way beyond my expectations. Did the repair in a timely manner and went above and beyond getting me stituated. I drove all the way from South Lake Tahoe to get my truck repaired there and was well worth the 100 mile drive one way.<//Text>

Hands down great customer service, body work, and overall quality. Jimmy, manager here is the man to see! Jim's secretary is very polite and knowledgeable as well. I cannot believe it's taken me so long to review them but I am WITHOUT a doubt pleased with the overall service provided here. I have been a customer since 2015 and plan to continue for as long as I own my vehicle.</Text>

Jimmy and the rest of the staff did an amazing job getting my Tacoma back to new in amazing time. Some other shops were giving 4-6 weeks time frame,  but they got it done in less than 2! All OEM parts, great job! Thank you!!!!< /Text>

I have learned from my insurance that what ever they did, could have been done within 10 days instead of the 22 days Folsom Lake Toyota, on top of that I was under-informed, they barely called back after me calling and asking for a call back.... I actually still do not know what they fixed on my car, I just took delivery and left asap... because the guy said my car would be done by Friday... so I took the rental my insurance gave me, so I don’t get overcharged.... and surprise, the car wasn’t done till the Monday after, and they did not even call me back on Friday or Saturday to say sorry the car wont be done, the guy says he called, but he really didn’t because I was on my phone all day Friday<//Text>< Pictures>

Brought truck in for repair after a drunk driver smashed into me at a stop sign,Repair took over a month when I thought they were repairing it but no they replaced the whole fender instead of repairing,Got my truck back replaced parts good but tank drained of all gas when I had left almost a half tank,all four tires down to 23 psi and I admit to leaving a coffee cup and o.j. cup when I dropped it off but they said they would wash and detail truck.Center console full of mold and interior was not detailed, rear tires clean and armor alled front tires werent touched.Iam disappointed I expect more from Toyota.Iam switching when lease is up.<//review>

<review>When someone hit my car I had an opportunity to either go to the collision center through my insurance or go with a collision center of my choice to fix my car. I decided to with the Toyota collision center not only because my car was a 2018 XSE Camry but because of their high average reviews for their quality of work. It was the best decision I made. Jimmy from Toyota was great to work with and kept me up to date on my car status. He also made certain that no short cuts with the repairs were made when dealing with the insurance. When I got my car back it looked and drove as if the accident never happened. Thanks Jimmy and staff from the toyota collision center!</review>< Pics>

< Review>
The customer service at Folsom Lake Toyota is outstanding! It is a 40 min drive from my houses and there is another location that is closer to me but I refuse to go anywhere but here! I’ve been coming here for the past two years ever since I bought my brand new Prius. I was beyond satisfied with the price of the car and then every single maintenance appt is just beyond my expectations. I also had to bring my to the collision repair due to vandalism and this was the best decision ever. I’ve could of gone else where but why would I do that? They have always taken good care of me and my car came out looking totally brand new! The work done on it is just outstanding. I will be coming back here for years to come. I hope their customer service never change! Thank you!</Review>

We worked with Rick. He was on top of everything. He always made sure we were informed on the progress of our van and was always available to answer our many questions. The repair was very costly and he worked really hard to get the cost down where he could. He also, had our van done in time for Thanksgiving which I’m sure was an a very busy time for him and his team. It was a total pleasure working with Rick! He really care about us and how we were treated. Thank you Rick you were a rockstar!!</Text>

The work done to my car looks awesome which is why I chose this place, but the amount of time it took and phone calls from me to get it done was rediculous. They must have had my car 2 weeks before they even touched it!< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Approximately 6 months ago, I had a car accident, and I chose Folsom Lake Toyota to fix my car.  Not to the fault of Folsom Lake Toyota, but they my insurance Company there was a lot of drama.  Finally I was able to pick my car up and it seemed all was well, after having my car for a while, I began to have some issues.  Just small things needed fixing no emergencies, but things started to change.  So not knowing what to do I called Jimmy in the body shop, because he was the one in charge of fixing my car after the accident, not sure all the issues were from m the accident, but asked Jimmy to look at the car and assess the situation and get back to me.  We did have a hard time getting together on our times for an appointment.  So finally we were able to get together, I let Jimmy know I wasn't sure all the issues were from the accident, but please look at it.  He was not happy with having to fix it, and I believe he was thinking I was trying to get work done for nothing.  So, his response was, well your car is an old car, but when he was fixing it from the accident, he told me that when he was done with it it would be like brand new when I got it back.  At the time he told me my car was an old car, my car had 48,000 miles on it.  I was taken back by his comment, then he told me he was really busty, because it was the end of the month, so he really didn't want to be bothered.  By the way I had 2 people with me who were appalled by the way he was trying to get rid of me.  One of which was buying a new car, and this made her change her mind on Toyota, and made her buy a Honda.  I told him I was not comfortable taking the car home, and I wanted him to keep it and find out what the problems were, because it was sounding unsafe, and I was not looking to have another accident.  Jimmy still did not want to keep it, or look at it.  So I refused to take the car home, and he said he didn't think they had a rental car for me, I told him to find out how much for a rental car, he finally broke down and got me a rental car.  2 days later, he called and said, I have taken the car for a test drive, and I can't hear any problems, I don't want to waste your time and money in a rental car, so you might want to come and get your car.  Then when we picked it up. After keeping it 2 days, told me he should have sent it to the service department, I looked at him and said I thought you were going to have someone check it out, 2! Days You had the car, and no one checked it .I was very disappointed, and I let him know I would take it someplace else and get a 2nd opinion.  He said that would be great and if they find anything to let him know and he would work with them.  Again another insult, he wouldn't listen to me , but he would work with someone else, and I get to pay again for someone else to look at it, then I get the privilege of bringing it back to someone who didn't want to work on it In the first place. Thank Goodness, I was able to try again, and Luckily I tried again, and I was able to work with Dan Barbariery, he said to bring it in and he would take care of the situations.  Again I had someone with me, and Dan took it for a 39 second test drive, and that's all he needed, told me what the problem was right away, took care of it right away, Dan Barbariery was wonderful, what a fabulous mechanic.  If  I had to rely on Jimmy in the Body Shop, i would never do business with you again, I would probably never buy a Toyota again.  But I can say I have never been so happy to say Dan Barbariery was FABULOUS.  I just can't say enough Great Words  for Dan Barbariery.  THANK YOU DAN, THANK YOU DAN, THANK YOU DAN< /Text>< Pictures>

My Experience

Since I left my Sienna for repair I never received a call from their staff for update, I left a message but they never call me back. I decided to drop by one afternoon to find out what was really going on,
Lance was talking over the phone when I got there few minutes later he excuse himself and went straight to the shop so I waited at the lobby for 22 minutes then he finally show up holding an old headlamp which I think a piece of garbage that had pick up somewhere just to show me that he is working on something… I asked him if I can see the van, we went to the shop and I was surprised on what I saw and smelled they just started the repair
minutes ago I can really tell by the technician’s actions. Not to mention the service is six days overdue a big miss on given estimated completion date. It never felt like my car was a priority for this repair facility I told Lance that I need the vehicle because my rental is limited. I did my best to inspect the vehicle after repair found a part that was not properly installed and extra part that is not supposed to be there, gas cap fell because it’s not attach/hook, in fairness though I like the outcome of the paint job. I need to go back there one more time to complete the repair, ugh…… more wasted time.< /Review>

I come hear once a month for a haircut. This store is always clean and neat inside and is conveniently located in this shopping center, but the main reason is your employee named Kent.
Kent is always upbeat, pleasant and just a great guy who does a outstanding job of cutting my hair.
I had to wait a few minutes before my turn and watched Kent throughly clean and disinfect his work station after his last customer left, wow, management take note, he is a keeper.<//review>

After 45 minutes of waiting, they let another person (the 3rd) get served before us. I walked out and the lady came after us, she explained that every one check in online (so did we). When we checked in it said it was a 30 minute wait, after waiting 45 minutes and no end in sight, we left.

I did feel that 20 dollars was a bit pricey. But I didn't have time to shop around because it was late.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Fantastic cut!! I love it! Estella listened carefully and thoughtfully to what I wanted today. She gave me a cut that was exactly how I wanted it, because she listened to me. I appreciate this store....my teenage son really loves the cuts he gets here too. Thank you Estella! You are talented and very nice.< /Text>

Cut my hair perfectly even thought I didn't quite know what style I wanted. They were also very friendly during the cut which helped my anxiety immensely. Would recommend to all of my friends.<//Review>

Apparently you MUST have an online appointment now. I sat there for over 30 minutes while people just kept coming in and going ahead of me. At that time of day it looked like I would never get helped. Ended up leaving and found a MUCH better place.< /text>

<review>We get our kids haircuts here. They do a good job. My little one had a hard time with haircuts. We even tried a few of those kid salons. He still would have a meltdown. For some reason though he likes it here.
It's clean, service is nice. The wait can get a little long on Saturdays, but that it so be expected. You can use the app and sign in ahead of time which makes it super easy.</review><Rating>4</Rating><gmapID>0x80ea432070036af5:0x41c4b6e7816c4a90< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
My partner and I came in for cuts as we were traveling through town. We had both been needing haircuts for a few weeks, but we wanted to wait until we could go to a Great Clips because we have always gotten good service through their shops. We didn't check-in online, but we were still seated within 10-15 minutes. My partner was taken care of by Maria, and she did an excellent job; his hair is the exact style he always like to get, and she was very quick about it. My hair was cut by Jocelyn, and I believe she is the manager of the store. I had shoulder-length hair, and I wanted it to be shortened to a pixie cut. She took the style I showed her pictures of and talked me through a few different changes based on my hairline and such. Once she started cutting it only took maybe 15 minutes from start to finish. She is obviously very knowledgeable and talented. I am very pleased with how it turned out, and if we lived locally I would go to her exclusively.</review>

<review>Myself and son were there when shop opened, waited 15 minutes after it opened for a haircut with no other customer in the shop. Then watched the next 3 people come in and be seated for cuts and we were told it would be at least an hour. After waiting another 40 minutes watching people be seated for cuts, I asked why this was going on.  If they would have explained it was by appointment to begin with we wouldn't have wasted an hour there. Zero for customer service and the fact they were rude when they had to explain it to us.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

< review>
I recently moved to Bakersfield from Los Angeles and wanted to continue going to Great Clips for my hair needs, so found this one on Coffee and Olive nearest to my home. I went in last month and now this month. I checked in online and when I got there about 2:30, they were busy with customers and one of the ladies there, asked me if I checked in online, and I said yes and sat down to wait for my turn. A couple of minutes later, a Great Clips Hair stylist walked in, saw me waiting, checked the computer, quickly set up her work area and quickly called me up for my haircut. I was greeted with a smile and a welcome by Hair Stylist Johanna, who took my info and helped with my hair cut needs to my full satisfaction. Johanna is one of the rare ones that combine barber haircuts with Salon Style care treatment with excellent customer service. Johanna went above and beyond my expectations and anyone's expectations of what excellent customer service and a great haircut stylist should be. She was amazing from start to finish. Johanna listened and did exactly the type of haircut that I asked. She did an an excellent job and I appreciate her attention to detail.  You can tell she has a beautiful caring heart and loves her talented job.  I liked my haircut so much, that I will be coming back to her for my routine haircuts.   So to recap, i got an excellent haircut at a reasonable price, didn't have to wait, and they carry everything I need for hair. Great Clips and their Hair Stylists like Johanna and my previous haircut stylist Maria get it right every time.  I'm not sure why you'd go anywhere else (unless overpriced and terrible haircuts are your thing). I have been a customer of Great Clips for years, can't imagine going anyplace else. I even refer family and friends.  Like with everything else, it's tough when moving to a new area where you have to get situated, but at least I am situated with this Great Clips for my hair needs thanks to Johanna and her amazing customer service and her great haircut and styling.<//review>

Hairdressers totally ignored me for over 25 minutes. They said my name was not on the online check in. Finally walked out after one of them took forever sweeping the floor but happily received a new customer. Very poor customer service. Won't be coming back.<//Review>

Always the very best place to go for a quality haircut.<//text>

I go here every time I get my haircut. They cost $15 for most. Not exactly sure. But thars what I pay and I believe all mens cuts are $15. Today I had a coupon and only paid $7.99. I'd reccomend. They also save what you get if you get the same thing every month or two.</Text>

Went in to get my hair cut.  3 Stylists, 3 customers.  No one waiting.  Stylist took my name and said someone would be with me in a few minutes.  I waited.  One customer paid and left.  Stylist went to back room to use the bathroom.  Came back and swept up.  Then told the other two stylists she was going out for Starbucks and asked if they wanted one,  She walked right past me and out the door.  I got up and left.  The two stylists stopped and watched me walk out, but didn't say a word.  The 3rd stylist was parked next to my car and watched me walk out, but didn't say a word.  Too bad.  These women don't care about the business and the manager wasn't; there.  She would have been furious had she saw what happened.</text>

Dr. Lee is quite amazing and has helped greatly with pain management.  The office staff is very organized, friendly, and prompt.  I feel comfortable with their COVID-19 regulations (temperature checks, cleanliness, masks, social distancing).  Their new office is beautiful and more accessible with an elevator now. We have been seeing Dr. Lee for a couple of years now.  He's worth it!<//Text>

Their Irvine office doesn’t have elevator, if you are in chronic pain you have to make stairs to second floor for your appointment, the reception person attitude is awful, the staff behavior is unpleasant and inexperienced. Patients service and supports are truly  unprofessional.</Review>

Besides not seeing signage, suite numbers or other identifying marks, other than the shared address on the top corner of the building, this place is located on the second floor and no elevators.You also have to enter through the doors of another establishment. Hopefully, you're able to walk up stairs. The reception is in the hall as you get to the top of the stairs and only 2 seats are offered for waiting.<//review>

It is frustrating to be hurting always and not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Over the years, as an amateur athlete playing many different sports, I understood my injuries were inevitable; yet, at least I wanted to manage manage my pain level. Dr. Lee did a wonderful job of assessing my problems, providing the most appropriate care and advice to eliminate recurring symptoms. He is truly a caliber of dedicated practitioner which inspire many of friends that I referred to his practice.< /text>

The raspados are yummy but pricey.  A large runs $9.00.  The paletas are good but they are $3.00 each.< /Review>

<rating>3<//rating><text>Customer service is alright. People have bad days, it's understandable, but the cashier's reception could have been better. It would have made us felt welcomed.

First time with wife and kids and the young girls got the 3 Maria's. Three scoops of ice cream, two cookie wafers in a cone. Pretty neat. The lady behind the counter placed a lot of detail in her work.

Wife, son, and I asked for ice cream bars/pops. My son went with Vanilla and he says he enjoyed it. Wife and I went with the Gansito flavored. The Gansito pop was alright. It almost tastes like it had been there for a while. Maybe it's not popular on this side of town.

La Michoacana on Cesar Chavez and Soto is much more fresh! Different owners different vibes.

Coming back? I won't be. I tried it though...thoughts??<//text>< user>

They have plenty of seating for customers and have added many more soft drink choices.  They have a full size drink fridge.  They have more ice cream choices since they merged with La Michoacana.  They take apple pay and Samsung pay.< /review>< pics>

Use to be a regular here, came in for strawberry’s con crema, over priced.
if I get a strawberry’s con crema with just the yogurt I assume it’s supposed to be filled at least half ways. Not just the first row of strawberries with crema. I asked if she can put more since I didn’t want any granola, coco or whip cream. And insisted it was a dollar more for a little more ??? A small size cup for $7 not worth it, if there going to be stingy..<//Text>

Was in the area getting my bike fixed at oriel's and saw this little shop nearby. Decided to try the pistachio bar and my bf tried the Walnut both were bomb! Only $2.50 each and both were filled with nuts.< /Text>

I’ve been a long time customer of Don Manuel but location has it all! The best raspados, ice cream and paletas. The manzanas locas are my favorite and everything taste super fresh. The store was very clean and the service was tremendous! Their prices are also very reasonable compared to other michocanas. I definitely recommend this new location to anyone who has a sweet tooth or the munchies.<//review>

Overnight dirt parking lot. Checked in 0750 for 8am appt. Staff assigned dock, I slid tandems & removed red line. Within 20 mins trailer was empty. Splendid work. Carl's Jr. on Shaw Ave has somewhat room for few trucks.<//review>

This place deserves no stars they are horrible.
They have no respect for drivers what so ever
Arrived at 8:45 am for a 9 am appointment it took them 45 to check me in because the guy at the check in was on lunch then after that took 1 hr to get someone to come out to verify the seal on the trailer .
2 hours later after they unload the two pallets 223 cases I go in to see why I am still waiting to find out my paperwork is done but they couldn’t be bothered to tell me because again the guy at front desk was on break!
They even over charged me on the lumper fees they charge me for 296 cases to unload when I only delivered 223.
The incompetence and level of disrespect at this warehouse is despicable and upper management need to be made aware of these issues.it is now 12:15 pm and I am finally done. 3 hrs for 2 pallets 223 cases is just ridiculous!!😡

Truck drivers beware when delivering to thes place.<//review>

This a very large restaurant. It is designed in one open single plane. I think it may be perfect to accommodate large groups. The restrooms are clean. The food is delicious, and they have karaoke on the weekends.< /review>

Not one to right a review ever but come on! Service was terrible. Unorganized. Kitchen was dirty. Equipment and plates not cleaned well. Glass cup was cracked. Food was ok. We arrived and they took a while to get us a menu when there were only 2 other people there. Brought us just salsa and no chips. Thought she'd bring it by later but never did.  Asked but never received. While for others they were brought some.  They forgot what kind of drinks we asked for in less than 5 minutes. They mixed up my order, still ate their mistake. On another plate they combine old chorizo with new and it ends up being burnt. In the kitchen they had wet floors with extension cables lying around. Don't give this place long before closing.< /review>

This place is great, the cashiers are great, and the place looks nice, they made the wrong flavored milkshake and made me a new one, I really do appreciate that. Any Milksake there is quality from the Chai to the Mocha milkshake, I recommend the Mocha.</Text>

We sat in the outdoor patio and enjoyed our cappuccino, latte, and churro croissant which were very delicious. Is the no cash policy a hindrance... not for us. Are the prices kinda high... a little. Would I go back again... definitely. Maybe because we were on vacation is the reason why we didn't mind to splurge on ourselves... but I'd do it again.</Review>< pics>

This was my second home while I was in town for work. Coffee is fantastic and baristas are very friendly. Bonus: they have treats for your pup and covered outdoor seating.</Review>

<text>We used to live by the intelligentsia in chelsea, so we were thrilled to see that intelligentsia opened a spot in Hollywood shortly before we moved to LA. They have great coffee drinks and some tasty nibbles. They have a fair amount of indoor and outdoor seating for a coffee spot in the heart of Hollywood.

My friend & I were having our coffee in-house but they put it in "steaming hot" paper cups instead of ceramic cups. They were too hot to hold. Had to request ceramic. The staff seem to be clueless. Coffee is good but wouldn't go to this location again.<//Text>

Can always trust the quality and service to be great at any Intelligentsia.

Bought their Summer Solstice blend which the barista told me is fruity, great for some cold brew at home in this 90 degree weather.

Also got their Limelight that they sell during the summertime. Very delicious and refreshing for being an iced coffee drink.

Interior is clean and professional. Can do some serious work here if needed, but also edgy enough to have a casual conversation.

They care for the environment by raising awareness from the usage of straws.

Their espresso drinks are solid and sophisticated.

Have not tried their teas, only coffee.< /text>

This cafe has a lovely swarm of flies that encircle it’s entrance. They greet you with a calm hello and buzz bye as you leave with your $6 coffee. Very happy Hollywood is finally worthy of real coffee and real stars. Who knows! Maybe a celebrity will walk though the doors as you’re sweetly sipping in the boulevard.<//Text>

Wow the espresso is so good. One of the best in LA.. I’ve been to a lot of coffee shops! This location isn’t super packed, has outlets everywhere, WiFi, and plenty of seating. I really love it here as a coworking space.</text>

New Intelligentsia in Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Pretty and neat interior.
Only downside is that it's in this area so hectic and hard to park.
Easier if you happen to be in the neighborhood and walking and need good coffee.</Text>

By far one of the best establishments I've been to. The interior design is priceless. The only way to fulfill or satisfy my potential here as their signature coffee beverages. I strongly suggest ordering their iced coffess though.
Conveniently located in the heart of Hollywood too.</Review>

"Legal tender for all debts, public or private"
Apparently they don't accept US currency,  despite the fact it's legal tender. Would be a good piece of info to include on your Google page. So yeah heads up, if you shop with cash this place isn't for you.

It's in a really great location and there's outdoor seating. The interior is quite hipster
My friend and I had the espresso. We were both looking forward to it because we are both espresso drinkers but this one left us disappointed.  We came back another time for some other coffee and came to the conclusion that milky coffee concoctions are their forte.<//Review>

Great coffee, great service, delicious pastries. Maybe it's a bit pricey, but calm down this is Hollywood Blvd. Don't complain about price on this street.<//text>< pics>

< review>
$5 for a cup of plain black coffee (and that’s the cheapest thing on their menu) and you don’t get refills. The coffee is no better than anywhere else. It’s hilarious to me that people pay these prices for no real value. Also the space is not good for hanging out or meeting. Not much seating and very uncomfortable chairs with no backs. One of the worst coffee shops I’ve been to in LA. When I asked the girl at the counter why their coffee is so expensive, she said, “we pay a lot more for our coffee” and I was like, then you shouldn’t be in the coffee business if you can’t negotiate good deals haha. Stay away<//review>

Overpriced five dollars for a coffee. Thus place is going cashless so therefore I'll not be able to do business with them. Iif the powers that be eliminate cash we are doomed to living every moment under the watchful eyes off Satan</review>

Coffee is good, but I just don't understand why every Inteligentsia location has the worst customer service ever. Every single time I visit an Inteligentsia location I get the worst hipster cashiers, with a ton of attitude and extremely careless.
Such a shame that a great design and great coffee are put down because of their bad training.
Also, I know it's easier and more cost effective to do only credit card transactions, but not even ApplePay? It's bad enough you don't receive cash, but you also don't take any other way of payment aside from credit card... Bleh.<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The best! ! I went to the Hollywood Blvd cafe and thought it looked good. Expectation was not betrayed. Not only espresso but also drip coffee is good. Single-origin cappuccino is Oichi ~~

The atmosphere is good, the technology is sure, and the staff are friendly.

Nice cafe

😤

最高！！Hollywood Blvdにあるカフェ、見た目がいいなと思いノリで入店。期待は裏切られなかった。エスプレッソ系はもちろんのこと、ドリップコーヒーもうまい。シングルオリジンのカプチーノはおいち〜〜

雰囲気もいいし、技術も確かにあるし、スタッフはフレンドリー。

素敵なカフェ

<review>(Translated by Google) Coffee is delicious.
However, the staff are unkind even though they gave me a tip when ordering. Holvin wanted to buy it, but I didn't want to spend money because it was unkind.
I don't want to recommend it because there are so many delicious places in Korea these days.

커피 참 맛있습니다.
하지만 직원은 주문시 팁까지 주었음에도 불친절해요. 홀빈도 살까했었는데 불친절해서 돈쓰고싶지 않았네요.
요즘엔 한국에도 맛있는 곳이 정말 많아서 그런지 추천하고싶지는 않아요.</review>< Response>

Tire Depot is honest, reliable, and affordable. The owner Mohammed, is a man of integrity. I’ve been coming here for about a year now for oil changes and a handful of other mechanic services. They always do a great job. Quick, thorough, and respectful.</review>

This place was so fast, at least three people helped with my tire and they had my tire size so I wouldn’t have to drive on a spare. They actually showed me why I needed a new tire and the price was good. Thank you again if your reading this< /Text>

<review>Very friendly and helpful place. We were 3 hours away from home. Had been turned away by one tire shop already. On our way to see Disney on Ice with a baby. Had a tire issue. Pulled in to see if they could look. Less than 5 mins later. They fixed my tire. We had a screw and they put a plug in it. Very thankful!< /review><Name>priscilla comer<//Name><user_id>110614019758763831960<//user_id></record>

<Text>Came to tire depot wanting to get some used tires after my usual spot was closed. The gentleman told me it would be a certain price but reduced it by 10 dollars for new tires. Also got an alignment. Good deal for alignment and was happy with the results on my Honda Civic. The gentleman who does the alignments (this was on Sunday) he did an amazing job with it. Car feels so much better after it needed one! So I do recommend coming on a Sunday to get the gentleman who works on getting the alignments !<//Text>< Pictures>

If I could I would give this place a ZERO! They wanted to charge me $60 to simply remove a bad tire off the rim and replace with a tire I bought elsewhere. I have the wheel off the car already....after explaining this to them for nearly 15 minutes because they can barely speak english he throws out a number...$60. Stay away from this place as they will rip you off!< /Review>

<text>They take the time to balance the tires with weights. Not sure if others do. Price was right. Only $250 out the door for 4 tires. Expect the job to take 1 hour.<//text>< pictures>

My low pressure light came on. They not just looked at tire but took it off to look for leaks. Then the check all the pressure on all the wheels.

Great service and it was at no charge.</Text>

<Review>Had these guys balance and put tires I brought in off of tire rack. They took over 2 hours to do so, everyone there seems to move in slow motion. After driving it home I found the front shakes (did not shake with the old tires) and they had failed to balance the tires properly. I came back to get the tires re balanced and they said they were to busy to help me. I came back again another day and they took the wheels off, went in the back (the balancing machine is back there I guess, if they have one?) and eventually came back out pointing out bushings on my car being bad as the cause, even though the shake definitely started once they replaced the tires. The shake was still there after, but again this took another 2 hours of my life, so I was happy to leave. I have since replaced the control arm bushings and the car still shakes, now I will pay someone else to balance and align my wheels as it seems these guys are incapable of doing it correctly.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Tried something new. Excellent food, friendly, and fast service. So much variety. One of my favorite places to go! If you like seafood put it on your list and they even have tofu and veggie options for those that don't. Support local business!<//text>

They have a wide variety of protein, base, vegetables and other mixers, sauces, and toppings.  They have salmon, tuna, scallops and also, beef, chicken, and cooked shrimp and crab for those who don't like raw fish.  The staff was friendly and the facilities seemed simple and clean, including the restroom.  The happy hour special is 2-5 and all day Sunday and brings the poke bowl down to $8.99, a crazy good deal given the quality and quantity of the food.  It is easily enough for a normal eater like myself to split into 2 meals or share with my wife or kids.  I will likely be going here a few times a week now that I have found this place.<//text><response>None< /response>< Name>

Placed an order over 45 mins ago. Was supposed to be ready in 20 mins...when I arrived the order had not even been started. She asked me to sit and wait. I don't know why I got an email my order was ready when it was not...I asked for a full refund. She said she had to call her boss...wow.</text>

Never had poke before, and the staff was super helpful in helping me make the perfect bowl for me. If you love sushi, this is right up your alley. 10/10 would recommend!<//Review>

This place is AWESOME. My first time trying Poke and the experience was great. They steered me in the right direction. Great portion for the price. Fresh protein and a great amount of selection for sauce and topping. I will definitely be back for more.<//Review>

I've eaten here twice in the last few days... it is so good! Fresh tuna and some spicy crab on a bed of riced cauliflower? Yum! I like the popular sauce combo of eel and spicy mayo. They have plenty of fresh fruits/veggies and other toppings and sauces, too. The staff has been great, as well! They were friendly and helpful to a first time poké eater like me. I would definitely recommend this place!</text>

Just had lunch there with my family. We have never had any type of poke bowls before and this place is amazing. The inside was super clean and the staff was incredibly nice. My favorite part was the freshness of every single ingredient. Would definitely recommend this place.</Text>

I wasn’t really sure what to expect when I stopped in to eat on my lunch break. As someone who’s never tried poke before ,they were great at helping me pick between the many choices I had in meats, toppings and sauces. The bowl that I ended up with was fantastic to say the least. I can say I will definitely make this part of my local restaurant rotation for lunch.<//Text>

Today was my first time here and I absolutely loved it! Like for real HOLY BOWLY! Their poke bowl was delicious, flavorful and had the perfect amount of toppings. Everything was fresh and super tasty. I’m a big fan of fish and basically anything sushi related and I’m glad I stopped by. I will definitely be visiting soon! Also, kudos to the nice gentleman working, I’m assuming it’s one of the owners?! Anywho, he was really friendly and I liked that he had a conversation with me. He was very nice and I very much appreciate when people are courteous! Thank you so much for the yummy food! :)<//Review>

Traveling through the area and needed dinner. Friendly staff, but the food lacked flavor. The spicy mayo wasn’t spicy (not even a hint of spicy). The rice was also long grain not sticky rice (more a personal preference I guess).< /Text>

< review>
Spicy tuna is a strange light pink color rather than orange and has no flavor or spice. Limited sauce options, ponzu had little flavor. They charge $1 extra for avocado. My small bowl (smallest option) w/ avocado came out to almost $12 and I couldn’t finish it because of the flavor. Not worth the price</review>

ZERO STARS REALLY!!!!! Tried going there over 5 times in the past 2 weeks and our section of the storage units has been locked and no one answers the phone. We rent the smallest unit in a controlled access area (in which it is supposed to remain unlocked during business hours).... AND WE CANNOT GET TO OUR UNIT TO GET OUR THINGS!!!! NO ONE ANSWERS THE PHONE BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS 2 WHITE CARS PARKED IN THE WORKER SPOTS!!!!! I repeat, we cannot get our personal items and no one answers your call!!!! ZERO STARS MORE LIKE IT!!!</text>

I really liked how they contacted me right away when I was looking for a storage.  Joshua was very knowledgeable with the questions I ask and Albert as checked in with me and when me and husband went in Alberta customer service was excited thank you gentleman for everything.  The detail put the icing on the cake for me.  But the customer service is what truly sold me.< /text>

I rented two lockers several years ago until I got settled, and didn't need them anymore. Recently moved into a smaller condo so I needed extra storage. I didn't hesitate to return to this location. Albert makes the rental process extremely easy, and works with you to get the right locker for your needs.< /text>

Wow, I had an wonderfully writtenunexpected visit today at Devon self storage. 🤗😄 The guy who helped me was so pleasant and he made my experience so smooth that I felt like I was somewhere else not spending my money. The unit he showed was clean as well as the whole facility. So whenever you need a extra storage or parking space, give Albert a call he will be more than happy to fin you what you need!<//review>

Albert, the manager,  was knowledgeable,  friendly, accommodating, and more helpful than we could have ever asked for! I am simply amazed at the level of caring  we recieved from a complete stranger. We not only bought supplies, but rented a small storage unit from Albert, just so we could see him more often!! Thanks so much!!!</text>< Pics>

First time here, and so far so good. "Devin" is the name of a guy I used to like, so I feel right at home :) Also, staff was kind and patient enough to wait an hour passed closing for me. Note: if first time here, dont forget your ID and credit card at home!< /Text>

So i moved out and didnt have the time to go into the office and properly close out my account. I read the rules and thought i would get charged another month as i didnt go in and close out... Albert was so nice, he saw that i had vacated and closed my account for me w/o me having to go in w a written notice! It is so nice to see that they werent all about the money and they didn’t charge me another month! Very cool and rare these days! Thank you Devon self storage!<//Review>

I would like to share the wonderful experience that I am having so far with the staff from Devon Self Storage on Radio Road in Palm Springs. In particular the assistant manager Ariana. She has gone above and beyond her call of duty to not only answer all my questions and concerns--furthermore her shining personality and friendly nature has made my experience here so far nothing short of wonderful!

<Review>DO NOT RENT HERE!!!

This place is being run by a Tyrant who will make you leave as soon as you do something he does not like. 15 long time customers have moved out in the last 2 months due to the tyrannical tactics being implemented here. They lure you in with a free months worth of rent, but they raise your rent a few months later to an unaffordable amount. Everywhere you look in this place there are red locks from people that are having their property stolen from them because they cant afford the  astronomical rent increases. Be weary. If it's too good to be true, it is. Good Riddance to this corrupt company!!!<//Review>< response>

It was the easiest storage rental that I've ever done. The staff was professional, helpful, and they took care of me wanting to switch to a bigger unit without any trouble at all. It was done in under 5 minutes. The office was clean as was my storage units. Devon on Radio St is A+ in my book. It should be the one you go to first to rent.< /review>

<review>I was referred  to Devon 's today by another storage location(lumberjack storage)  due to the fact they no longer had small units available and only had 10x15 for $130 which was too large for the thing's we needed to store.  The first impression we got from Albert  (the guy helping  us) seemed to be a good until he started to show the units. He stressed  they were very competitive and prices matched of other storage locations in the area which made me very happy. He showed my husband and I storage units that was an 8x10 then quoted the price of $130 which I thought was expensive, then he showed us a 5x10 he quoted  a price of 80 which thought that was expensive too so I said  since you price match the storage location around the corner is cheaper so he told he to go back to that location and get the prices in writing and he would match them so my husband and I went back and got the prices in writing and returned back to him. He was shocked to find out that the 8x10 was only $70 and the 5x10 was only $50.  He didn't believe that the prices were that low so he pretended to be a Customer and called the location and they gave him the same prices over the phone. He then changed his whole story and  said I can't honor that ( after we wasted time and gas). He then said I can give you the 5x10 for $80 I then asked why did you say you prices matched  ( which we never asked for  he voluntarily told us that) if you weren't going to honor it? He then told us what he could do is give us half off the first two months which basic math would of made it $40 But then he stated it would be $76 for the first 2 months. Me and my husband looked at eachother and said half of 80 is 40 and he could not explain why it wouldn't be $40. Albert is very shady don't  do business here they make up prices and they are not competitive at all. They lie to you.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I had to pack and move my whole house, change storage spaces within three days very spontaneous move, and Clarissa the manager stayed late to let me use dollies, and was very helpful to me and even gave me her cell number if there was anything she could do to help. So thank you for helping during a vety stressful time. I really appeciated all that you did.

<Text>The on-site manager, Albert, acted as a professional which is always refreshing. He gave me the straight scoop and a basic walk through of the facility.  I asked about getting a storage room with climate control and if there were any promotions.  He gave me both.  I already knew Devon Storage had the best rates because I had called several other storage companies.

There has been talk about some theft though it would appear to have come from someone that stayed in the yard after closing hours. To be on the safe side I purchased the maximum theft insurance. All storage facilities have their share of theft though I am optimistic I will be fine. The place is obviously well maintained with modern camera security through-out.  Devon Storage is as good as it gets and I feel secure storing my valuables here.

UPDATE: I had written a glowing review because I was new at facility. I will refrain from too many details as this is going to court. I'm not sure about anyone else but you put your entire life in a storage and you expect it to be safe. In the middle of the month on the 14th I received a letter stating "Thankyou for your patronage!" On the 16th with no warning at all auctioned off well over a quarter of a million dollars in items my family owned over the course of half a century. We owned one of the 1st player pianos ever made. Everything we owned was top notch and it's why I elected to pay for extra insurance. Albert auctioned my family's heirlooms and all I had in life for approx. 300 dollars. I even told him I had a safe with 32 emeralds and a few art pieces worth over 25k each. I got sucked into him portraying this image of being a good Christian.  He was used to me always paying my bill the last day of the month. Screenplays I had written and piano recordings of when I was six years old. My dad's watercolors as he was a professional artist....all gone. Replaceable?  Impossible. A million dollars wouldn't start to put out the anger I have for Albert and his scum sucking family. SOMEDAY SOON I'll HAVE MY DAY IN COURT.< /Text><Resp>{'time': 1492799161370, 'text': 'Roman Terry, thank you for leaving this detailed feedback about your experience with Devon Self Storage.'}</Resp><Pics>None< /Pics>< user_id>

Hey everybody! The first time i met Mr. Albert at Devon Storage he was sweeping out a newly vacated storage unit. THAT IMPRESSED ME. A couple of weeks after moving into my outdoor unit i noticed my light switch was broken amd in fact the light bulb was out too. I mentioned that to Albert and the next time i came to add to my unit THE SWITCH AND BULB WERE REPLACED.

The office is curteous. The entire complex is always clean and my safety and the safty of my stuff has never been in doubt. I originally planned on storing my things for three months but have now after 17 months my unit is now an extention of my home.

Thx Devon and Thx Mr. Albert.</Text>

Victoria was absolutely AMAZING. I will request her for all of my fittings and bridesmaids dresses. She was so patient and understanding, she’s put up with me through two appointments already and probably two more to go lol. She’s wonderful and the entire staff was so accommodating and friendly, I felt like it was a girls day and we all could just enjoy each other’s company. My parents were amazed at how wonderful the experience was. They will get my referrals and business that’s for sure! She made me saying yes to the dress so special, I couldn’t have imaged it any differently. She not only helped me find my dress in one appointment but also the veil, belt and shoes. She’s a goddess. AND IF YOU’RE A DISNEY FAN. She’s your girl!</Text>

I totally had a ‘Say Yes To The Dress’ experience at David’s Bridal with Jesse today.  I went to the store to browse dresses as a Mother of the Bride.  Upon arriving, I was given the freedom to look around a bit by myself before connecting with a stylist, which I really appreciated.  Within a few minutes I was greeted by stylist Jesse who stealthily listened to me share info about myself, the wedding venue, and what I was looking for, and he hand-picked 4-5 dresses for me to try on.  The first dress that I tried on was a bit out of my comfort zone, but I trusted Jesse and the process.  He jacked me up with shoes, a blingy belt, and a wrap to help cover my arms that I’m self-conscious about.    This perfect stranger whom I had only known for 30 minutes totally transformed me.  I felt beautiful—and that is no easy feat!  I tried on the other dresses that Jesse pulled for me, but he rejected them before I even saw myself in a mirror because he felt they didn’t match my personality.  He was right!  His intuition and the way he connects with people is such a gift.  David’s Bridal was the first store that I shopped at for my special dress, and I bought the very first dress that I tried on.  That says a lot!   Thanks to Jesse and the kind staff at David’s Bridal for all the royal treatment!< /Text>

My bridesmaids and I just went in for our appointment to shop for their dresses this past Sunday and our experience was so nothing short of perfect! I booked our appointment for 10:30am a couple of months ago and although they called me to ask if we could go in at a later time because they were overbooked, I mentioned that some of my bridesmaids were unable to do a later time since they were driving 2 hours to go to the shop. They were understanding an allowed us to keep our original appointment time.

When we arrive we saw other parties with the same appointment time but nonetheless, we were checked-in and our stylist Jesse introduced himself to our party and informed us that he would be working with us and another party. Jesse and the  manager, Andy were constantly checking in on us throughout our appointment and were so friendly, attentive and helpful regardless of them being overwhelmingly busy. All of my bridesmaids were so pleased with the service we received during our visit and I (the bride) am extremely happy that all four of them found a dress that they loved. Thank you, David's Bridal in Northridge staff for your exemplary service and attention! You made my bridesmaids feel extremely special and cared for when shopping for their bridesmaid dresses.</text>

<Review>With only two months before my nuptials I walked into David’s Bridal very optimistic the place is huge!! Clean and Classy. My Consultant ‘Anya” was a Gem!! Great listener, knowledgeable, professional, Sweet as can be, and on top of it with all the styles and fashion.
Every gown she pulled looked great one me. I finally found The One and said YES to the dress. This place has the best Customer Service from the Manager to the Consultant White Glove Service. The Seamstresses or Alterations Ladies were the best!! Made me feel beautiful, confident, worked with my body flaws and made me feel like a perfect women.
God bless them all. Looking forward to seeing them again October 9th for my fitting.</Review><rate>5<//rate>< name>

I basically bought a dress off the rack and Ashken and her team transformed my off the rack dress into a dress I had seen on line but couldn't find anywhere. The dress turned out beautiful and made to fit me, so I felt like I had gotten a custom made dress rather than an off the rack dress.  The alterations where actually more expensive than the dress itself, but worth it and still stayed within budget. Great experience overall.<//Review>

I really loved how kind, friendly, and understanding the staff in alterations were. When covid required me to reschedule my appointments multiple times, they were completely understanding. They made me feel beautiful whenever I wore my wedding dress, even when it needed to be taken out a bit after gaining some weight over Covid. Thank you for making me feel special!< /review>

Everyone was so nice, friendly and helpful. My family has been coming to David's Bridal for over 20 years and have never been disappointed. They have beautiful dresses. From 1st Holy Communion to wedding dresses and more! They have something for everyone and great prices. Our consultant was awesome she was on top of it! We will be back, especially since I have more daughters. I would definitely reccomend David's Bridal to everyone.</Text>

< Review>
I went in the other day to have my grandmother’s dress altered. My grandmother raised me, but unfortunately, she passed away a few years ago. This dress has a lot of familial value to it, and it’s a way I can take my grandmother with me on my special day. By the end of my alteration, I felt like a beautiful queen. I think I got a chance to talk to everyone in the store, and they were all patient and really helpful with coming up with simple yet elegant ideas. This was the best moment of my engagement this far< /Review>

I had an incredible experience at David's Bridal. After feeling that I was being  simply "sold" at another place I came to David's and received a breath of fresh air. Although I am young and this is the place my mom bought her dress, David's knows how to do wedding dress shopping. From picking options, where Heather picked out dresses I did not know I even wanted, to Tiffany being the sweetest to help me say yes to my dress, I had an amazing experience. I even was able to take a moment and imagine myself in the dress as I walked down the aisle. In the excitement of wedding dress shopping the minute to pause was exactly what I needed. Then they helped even further with providing a reasonable price of cleaning and keepsake and all the accessories needed for my dress. If you can, go David's bridal. Great pricing and great employees to give you a wonderful experience.< /review>

<Review>My family and friends weren’t able to go with me to my first bridal fitting, which was a bit of a bummer. Victoria was so sweet and helpful and made it feel like I had a friend with me! I ended up finding my dream dress and I feel like a princess!

The whole team at the David’s Bridal in Northridge made me feel special. I can’t say enough good things about them!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This was my 3rd experience coming to this store for a dress fitting. Being a plus size bride I was having a hard time finding “The One” and this time Annette helped me.  She was on a mission to help me find a dress.  The first one I tried on was gorgeous but a little over budget so she went right back and found a couple of options in my price range and I still couldn’t find the right one, finally she came with the perfect dress. It fit like a glove, it was gorgeous!  I had my mother in law with me and we both cried. Annette went above and beyond to help me find the right dress and under budget!! I loved this experience! Nina helped me the time before and she also worked very hard! Andy also helped ring me up and told me all the options to pay and was extremely helpful as well. Today I had such a wonderful experience!!<//Text>

Anette, listened to the ideal dress type I wanted and gave suggestions. Tried 2 clothes and It was quick and smooth, never thought I’d go with the romper, but it was perfect! I’m glad I found David’s Bridal, best decision I’ve made. Anette was really sweet and she really knows what goes best with the outfit. Thank you!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

We had a appointment for 12 pm the person who was suppose to help us never show up, we look and try things ourselves and no one bothered to even ask us if we need any help. There is not a lot of choices like I have seen in other places. If you have another choice for a bridal store go there prices are the same everywhere.<//text>

All the staff are extremely helpful! Half the time I wasn't sure what to take into consideration and walked in not really knowing what I wanted! Carrie was extremely patient and offered different options for me. DJ in alterations made me feel confident in changes I needed for my dress and pointed out things that I should consider for different parts of the wedding. I definitely would recommend them!

***Edit: came back for final alterations appointment and pickup. DJ completed everything that I asked for and I love my dress! It's fits absolutely perfectly! DJ definitely puts precision and care into her work! And I even had to have it rushed because I did everything late and it was ready with time to spare!! Highly recommend!</text>

<Review>Such a fun experience!! I worked with DJ in alterations and she is lovely and so talented, I was ready to wear my dress immediately, pins and all!

Can’t wait to see the finished project - it’s about a 7 week turnaround for the alterations, with a few weeks of cushion before the wedding in case any additional alterations are needed. Pricing is fair and everyone working at the shop is wonderfully attentive and helpful! Can’t recommend this location enough xx</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1609627214522, 'text': "We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your time with our team!

< Review>
Amazing store manager and consultants. The store really has a solid teamwork environment  that cant be felt  by customers as genuine and sincere.  We walked in without an appointment and were assisted promptly.
Brought my sister all the way from the High Desert after having a horrible experience at another David's bridal in Ontario.
We bought the dress that she initially wanted to buy at the other location.</Review>

Even better is when everything is on sale! The consultants are friendly, but a little bit pushy if you seem undecided. You can use that to your benefit and get more coupons like I did in store. I’m only giving 4 stars because the alterations are unexpectedly expensive. I paid more for those than for my dress.</review>< resp>

I made an appointment on line for the same day.  I needed a bridesmaid's dress for a wedding in Colorado in July.   When I showed up,  Andy was there and available for my appointment without any waiting.  He quickly found the color and style dress I needed and helped me try on a similar dress for sizing.  Bridesmaid's dress ordered!  However, I had so much fun talking with Andy and realized my vow renewal "could" happen in October, since my 30th didn't happen last October due to Covid.  Long story short, Andy found the PERFECT dress for me and I bought a wedding dress as well.  It arrives in July!</text>

Update: The dress I ordered came in early, so I had my first and only fitting with Esther.

My wedding is in less than a month, and I haven't picked out any decorations, catering, or even a color scheme, but I know my dress is the one thing I will NOT have to worry about at all (that and the groom....). Esther was amazingly accommodating, knew exactly how to accomplish what I was looking for, and put me completely at ease (despite my fitting falling literally on Election night!). 6 out of 5 stars.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone from the woman who greeted us when we walked in to management came over to talk to me about the dresses I tried on, offer suggestions, bring different accessories to try with each dress, and Victoria not only found my PERFECT dress almost instantly, she made me feel like helping me find my perfect dress was her life's work and favorite hobby. I wish I had more occasions to shop there and that I could give her 6 out of 5 stars.</Text>

My entire experience with David’s has just been perfect. I got my dress, my bridesmaids dresses and my mother in laws dress and each experience has always been so positive. The sales people are so attentive, patient and of course flattering. The alterations department is amazing and they made everything better than i could have imagined. I want to particularly thank Ashken, Ester and DJ in alterations. my dress has MANY layers and they were patient and meticulous to ensure everything is exactly where it should be. thank you all so much<//text>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>Lots of people helped us when we came in to look for a bridal dress for me. But the person who stood out the most was Ruben. He was such a sweetheart! I had found a dress after 2 hours of looking, and when I found my dress, I actually had to take a few hours to leave it alone and come back, to make sure it was my dress. They let me come back the same day and try on the dress again before I actually purchased it! That was so nice of them to let me come back without another appointment for the same day! My dress was $299 plus a 15% on top of that! Alterations are in just a few days. Thank you to the team at David’s bridal Northridge!<//Text><GmapID>0x80c29ba09c87971b:0x890455753f16682e< /GmapID><username>Lisa Sawaged< /username><user_id>117782804150946959809< /user_id>< resp>

I had a great experience with David’s bridal. DJ helped me with my evening dress and  my  daughter’s wedding dress alteration as well . We just picked up  the dresses and it looks so beautiful and fits perfectly specially the wedding dress.
Thanks to DJ.<//Review>

My bridal party and I had such an amazing experience. Andy, our stylist, did such an amazing job with finding the dresses I was looking at, as well as providing other similar options for those they currently didn't have in store. I was able to find my perfect dress, with my ladies, all the while remaining safe and socially distant from other customers in the store. Thank you so much Andy and David's Bridal for this amazing experience.< /Review>

Had the best experience! Victoria and a gentleman( think he was the manager) were both so sweet and helpful and made this experience so special and fun! She gave me a lot of options to help me figure out which one I felt my best in. It was pressure free and she really understood what I was looking for and helped me narrow down the perfect dress! Thanks David Bridal and Victoria for taking such good care of me!</review>

I needed a dress less than 20 days. I found 2 dresses in 1 day. DJ was a great help.  She answered all my crazy questions and made my shopping experience sweet and stress free.  I appreciate your great customer service and would recommend this location to anyone looking for a maid of honor, bridesmaid dress. Out of the dresses I tried, one of the ones I picked was a style you brought out for me. I loved how it looked on me more than the other style I chose for myself.</Text>

<Text>Give this place a try when you go wedding dress shopping. I went in to browse and try on wedding dresses for my wedding in 6-7months from now. I had no expectations of walking out the store with my dream wedding dress. As a plus size women and during covid I was a bit nervous to go in for my appointment. But I had the best time of my life and walked away with my dream wedding dress! From the time I walked in this store and was greeted by a staff member the customer service was great. A special shout out to Julissa and the alterations team for the close attention to detail and all the help they gave during my appointment. I really felt like a princess. The whole team practiced safety measures and still gave 100% customer service. Trying on wedding dresses with Julissa made me feel like my best friend was there shopping with me as she was able to balance being both professional and personal with her customer service skills. She was caring and very in tuned to what I liked and disliked. She eventually helped me pick out the veil that I bought to go with my dress. 10/10 I could not better recommend this place!!! I will be coming back to help my mom purchase a dress for the wedding for her here!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

My appointment at David’s Bridal was an amazing experience I am very grateful to have had for my first time trying on dresses! I was welcomed with cheer and excitement walking in. My stylist, Ruben, picked out a great selection of gowns, accessories, and cape/boleros for me to try on that went exactly with the inspiration/theme I was looking for. His style and personality definitely made the experience a pleasure.</text>

This store gave me an AWESOME experience! They are so welcoming and warm. I always thought going to a David’s Bridal would be mediocre compared to a boutique, but ladies, you can have it all! Inexpensive dresses, good quality, and great service. Try it out! You won’t be disappointed. (Thanks to Madi, Victoria, and Erika for helping me find the dress that made me cry!)</Text>

I had a great time at David’s Bridal. A group of us bridesmaids got paired with Victoria from the Northridge location and she was amazing. There was absolutely no pressure and she was very helpful in finding a dress that suited our styles. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an amazing experience!</text>

Tiffany helped me find an amazing wedding dress and DJ from the alterations department helped me customize my dress to fit me perfectly.   The manager Andy helped me to exchange an item without difficulty.
Thank you for a wonderful bridal shopping experience with additional safety precautions during COVID times.< /text>

Me and my fiancé went in today to get my dress (taken in at the waist and sides = $110) and his dress pants (taken in at the waist & paint legs = $109) tailored. This was a rush job and I needed it done by Thurs., 12/17/20. Ashkhen (I’m sorry if I butchered your name) was super sweet and accommodating, and said she’d have it done by Tues., 12/15/20.

09/19/2020 I came in with really no expectations. I thought I would have to look elsewhere after coming here. I came in with a picture and a dress in mind.  Carrie helped me through it all. You can tell she knew what she was doing and she loves what she does.  After trying maybe 6 or 7 dresses, there was a last minute dress she had me try on and she just nailed it.  It’s simple, classic, and elegant.  And she made me emotional towards the end of it and it just all became so real after that.  Thank you so much, Carrie!  And everyone there was just so helpful and kind.  I’m glad I came here first.

10/17/2020 Again, always fun when I come here! I came in for my fitting and DJ helped me out. She’s so nice! She was awesome and very easy to work with.  Thank you again, DJ! Can’t wait to get the final product!<//Review>

Carrie was the best stylist a woman can ask for. She had great taste, was sweet, helpful and she even stayed longer to help even when she had to clock out for her shift. I appreciated having her so much, she made this entire experience very easy and enjoyable. Alex the manager is also helpful and kind as well. 5 stars all the way<//Text>

<text>I didn’t have a particularly good experience at this location. I was looking for a dress to attend a wedding. I made my appointment and everything was ok up until then. I showed up to my appointment and the gentleman at the entrance ushered one of the ladies from the back. Everything went ok up until it was time for me to leave. Note that I had just had my baby, so I was dress shopping at multiple places. Well, the lady that assisted me wasn’t thrilled that I didn’t purchase a dress from her. Made a point to tell me that she got reassigned from a bridal party just to assist me and that she worked for commissions. She made me feel so uncomfortable I can’t even explain. I gathered my 2 week old baby and walked away from the store at the verge of tears. As a new mom, I was particularly hormonal and very sensitive and conscious about my body after birth, so of course I wanted to try out several different dresses before even committing to anything. Her lack of sensitivity and her response to my intentions to come back later earned this location a 1 star.</text>< Pictures>

Very helpful and knowledgeable staff! From picking the dress, to the vail, and getting me my dress fitted perfectly when it was a rush wedding! Thank you alterations for making sure every final detail was perfect and helping my maid of honor learn how to do the corset easily. Will 100% recommend them for anyone who asks where to shop!< /text>

I found my dress!!! The consultants were super sweet. I went there on a Monday so it was super slow. I had one consultant at first then another bride showed up so we had to split her but then all the sudden more consultants showed up. I had so much help and I felt like they really cared. I couldn't have been more grateful that they extended my time there so I could find my dress. It was crazy cause a bride showef up after me and said yes to a dress before me. So I ended up with I think it was 6 consultants. I felt well cared for and special.< /text>

The original girl that was helping me out with my dress was horrible but once the manager stepped in she was amazing. She followed thru with everything she said she would.  The lady that did the alterations was absolutely amazing as well.  Did everything I asked for my dress.  Overall my experience was great given the circumstances we are living in at the moment.</Text>

Last minute COVID reschedule dress purchase with alterations.

They pulled it off.  Thank God!

Fast, convenient,  efficient.

Later iin 2021 will be the big celebration,  but didn't want to make the smaller one any less.

They met desired expectations.

Great spot for expedient service.</Review>

Erika was very friendly, knowledgeable, competent, efficient, and she helped me create a fabulous second look for my big day!

I had the pleasure to be helped by Ruben. And let me tell you, he basically picked out my wedding dress. He pretty much saw what I liked from my own selection and brought out a dress he thought I would like, and I fell in love!
Such a genuine soul. I’m so thankful he was there to help me. Thank you to Ruben & Madison ❤️❤️❤️<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>As a first time bridesmaid, I have been slightly overwhelmed with planning what to wear. I had an appointment and was paired with Ruben as my stylist. I literally had no firm dress styles in mind and really only so many requests made by the bride of what she'd prefer we don't choose.  Ruben helped me with different style options and was like my own personal hype man when we found some good ones. The process became too easy. Great customer service!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Visited the Northridge location in November. Doors were open and COVID protocols were being followed. The appointment was 1 hour, I tried on two dresses and I found "the one". Both women who helped me were very friendly, offering suggestions on accessories and on what alterations would be needed.</text>

<Review>I recently went into David’s Bridal to look at wedding dresses for the first time. I’ve always been kind of a tomboy and I was nervous, but they made me feel welcome. They were also great when it came to the precautions due to the pandemic, so I felt at ease there, too. My stylist was Ruben and he really listened to everything that I said. Shapes I liked, shapes I didn’t like, what I was comfortable with, what I wasn’t. I tried on five dresses and the last dress that I tried on ended up being the one. And I had seen it when I first walked in with my mom and soon to be mother-in-law and really liked it. It was perfect. The perfect silhouette and shape that I wanted and everything. And we’re having a summer wedding, so Ruben took that into account too. I told Ruben that I wanted to add some Grecian elements as a nod to my fiancé (he loves Greek mythology) and he found a GORGEOUS rhinestone leaf belt that absolutely tied it together. Ruben and the team at David’s Bridal in Northridge made this tomboy feel like a princess and I cannot wait for my fiancé to see me in this dress next August. Thank you so much for all of your help and tips, Ruben! I am beyond grateful. And thank you to the rest of the team for all of your help, too! I also walked out with swatches for my bridesmaids’s dresses in the EXACT color that I had in mind and more tips from the rest of the team. I would absolutely 100% recommend David’s Bridal in Northridge to any bride looking for an amazing experience, knowledgeable staff and beautiful dresses for great prices (I was blown away by the price of my dress, seriously). I can’t wait to send them pictures! Thank you all again!! ❤️👏</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>I made my first ever bridal appointment here at David's Bridal. I had no idea what I wanted or what my budget was. Aimee and Andy helped me out and were absolutely wonderful! Aimee listened to everything I had to say about each dress, including what I liked and what I didn't. With that information, she'd search for a dress that was much more up my alley. Each time she came back with a dress, she got closer and closer to what I wanted. I went into the appointment thinking that I wanted a fuller skirt, but came out realizing that I did not at all like ballgowns, and instead liked sheath!< /Review>< Rate>

Olivia was absolutely fantastic. I cannot express enough how wonderful she was. I had to find a dress quickly and I had very specific requirements. She worked with me , listened to me. She was supportive and absolutely phenomenal. Thanks to her, we found a dress that's going to work perfectly. She made me feel at ease. Shopping in general, especially for dresses is not my forte and she was patient and kind and really made it all happen. She is knowledgeable, sweet and professional. I highly recommend her. Everyone in the store was wonderful. Andy was also very helpful and accommodating. Thank you so much<//text>

Karla was so fantastic. I was a walk in appointment, it was a pretty quiet Saturday afternoon and they had me in with Karla, the stylist, in about 15 minutes. She was so wonderful and thoughtful. She asked me separately about my budget just to make sure she didn’t ask in front of my other family and avoid an awkward moment. And she worked so well with my budget too! Never did she bring a dress that was over my budget. My wedding will be a religious ceremony and so it needs sleeves and she worked so well to accommodate exactly what I wanted in a dress and figured out what I liked about each dress I tried so she could find others that were better and better fits. She got alterations staff to explain the alterations and modifications they could do to the dresses I liked. She was fun and intuitive and I highly recommend her. It was my first experience trying on dresses and she never pressured me to buy anything right away that I didn’t feel totally sure about. The whole staff was so sweet and helpful with their opinions and many other stylists would pop by and offer advice and helped my two younger sisters try on bridesmaids dresses. We were treated like queens basically :) In the end I didn’t end up purchasing a dress from David’s due to the fact that I live out of state so it wouldn’t have worked with my timeline, but I have nothing but good things to say. If you’re here for the first time and wanting to figure out what you like without being overwhelmed (while feeling hyped up and cared about too!), Karla at David’s in Northridge is your girl.</review>

Where do I start? First off I would like to say that not just shopping for a wedding dress but shopping for the right one for such a special day is very much a challenge and isn't something that could be easily done by oneself!  On Friday 10/18 I got my wedding dress and I owe it to the lovely staff at David Bridal! My Stylist Olivia made my day..... Olivia is an Outstanding individual, never once giving up on me throughout the process. It was not easy because I did have a budget but Olivia happily took on the challenge. Olivia was poised, creative, patient, caring, optimistic and how could I forget Dedicated! I got to do the Bell Ceremony which I loved and ended with myself feeling confident in regard to my choice. Towards the end of the my journey I met Sales Manager Andy. Andy has great energy and a Helpful spirit! He was accommodating as well, He told me if I had any questions or concerns to give them a call and this gave me comfort and reassurance. In conclusion great customer service is very hard to come by and it's the Individuals like Olivia and Andy that make this experience worth while.< /Text>

< Review>
My fiance went to try on dresses today. There was a maximum  of 6 dresses to try on because of the COVID-19. Everything started good. They had a full rack on dresses and we chose from them. After trying on some dresses the girl seemed frustrated. Even made the following statement “There are a maximum  of 6 dresses to try on.. So I wouldn’t recommend just trying them on for fun.. You know what I mean”. She didn’t care about about her customer. She ended up buying a weeding dress somewhere else! No thanks to David’s Bridal. Do not go here if you want to feel discriminated and be whispered about while shopping.<//Review>

David’s bridal worked throughout my covid wedding! ..I was supposed to get married in May so I bought my dress in January. Took my bridesmaids to get their dresses in February but then in March everything changed. All the stores closed and I had to push my wedding back, everything about the wedding was on hold. My dress was taken to David’s bridal to be altered in February & had been there throughout quarantine. Thankfully in June they started opening & I was still able to get my dress altered & my fiancé and I decided to do a smaller wedding at this end of this month & I was able to have my dress altered in time. Dj in alterations was very sweet & very helpful! The staff were always very helpful & nice & understanding even when I asked if my bridesmaids needed to exchange their sizing in dresses in case they didn’t fit into them anymore (which they did) but I’m glad they offered the help! Thank you Tiffany at David’s bridal for helping me find my dress & Dj for my alterations! I can’t wait to finally wear my dress!<//text>

Elizabeth was such a wonderful stylist! She was fun, had great suggestions and figured out exactly what I needed. The entire staff was so friendly and encouraging, and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. To be honest, I wasn’t going to go to David’s because I wanted a more unique dress (that I wouldn’t see all over Instagram) and I thought their dresses were too expensive, but I found exactly what I wanted within my budget! Would highly recommend! 5 out of 5 stars!</text>

The employees were really nice and I had no problem with them. The dresses on the other hand, if you’re expecting to have any sort of wedding vibes and butterflies for the experience, this isn’t the place. Dresses were dirty, and the overall vibe felt like I was shopping for a sweet 16 or prom.<//review>

First off, the store was taking the social distancing seriously, everyone had on masks, there was hand sanitizer stationed in a few different sections. Erica was helpful, I told her she had a big job on her hands, try to make me look beautiful and not look like a box in a dress (yeah, I'm fat). Well, we picked a few dresses, after she gave me some style suggestions, and within the 3 the magic was done! I didn't look like a box, I felt pretty and excited. I also want to give a shout out to Charles, he had some good suggestions also. I hope I got their names correct, the day was a bit of a blur but I know I'll send any friends there and in 5 years when my soon to be hubby and I do a vow renewal (because this Covid business sucks and we can't have a gathering) I will go back to get a new (smaller?lol) dress 😁   Thank you for the kindness and the patience. I did not feel rushed to make a decision. I feel that if I wanted to try on 20 dresses, she'd have been with me every step of the way, not giving me attitude but keeping that same high energy.<//review>

I went to my first alterations appointment yesterday and was incredibly happy with the results.
Perry was helping me and all of my concerns and questions were answered promptly. She helped steer me in the right direction when I had questions about the back of my dress and even gave me options on different bustles that would work which I truly appreciated since I didn't bring an entourage this time around. I can't wait to see the results in a month!</review>

I am sooo happy I came to this David’s bridal. I didn’t have an appointment but they still managed to take me in and I’m so glad they did! I was paired with Karla as my stylist and she went above and beyond for me to help me find my perfect dress and I found the one!! They even stayed with me even though the store had been closed for 30 minutes. Best service ever. I had such a wonderful experience I can’t wait to come back for alterations and for my girls dresses< /review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>Best experience!! From scheduling my appointment amid COVID, all the way to picking up my wedding dress from alterations, DB Northridge staff were phenomenal.
Liz (store manager) was super friendly and attentive.
My consultant was great at suggesting different veils.
And alterations... so happy and satisfied, not only with the work they did (I’m super picky about bustles and how they did mine was perfect!), but the customer service was outstanding. I had to reschedule my original appointment and it was no problem. Plus, I was running late to my appointment and they were so kind about that! They took the time to offer some great advice on all the little details, and even made a last minute alteration to the dress!
Everyone you interact with truly cares about you as a person and is happy and eager to make things so special !!
Thank you to everyone at DB Northridge for such an awesome experience and all the care you showed!<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< userid>

Ashken in alterations is AMAZING! I only had to have one alterations appointment and my dress fit perfectly! She added a bustle to the dress that perfectly pinned up the train so I can easily dance at my wedding. Ashken was thorough with her work and very kind and friendly with helping me make my dress fit perfectly!< /Text>

I was here getting bridesmaids dresses for a friends wedding with the whole bridal party, Cat and Shayla (I believe) helped us and they were amazing. They looked up so many different dresses and sizes for us and I found the perfect dress that was limited edition and they were able to order it in the next size up for me (literally perfect). They were so kind and catered to literally all of our needs❤️if you can book with them definitely do it.< /Text>

<Review>The two stylists who helped me pick out the dress were so lovely. They helped answer all my questions and made me feel comfortable in my own body and made sure I found the dress and the accessories I would absolutely love. We ordered my dress and veil and I was able to pick it up in store a month later.

During my second visit to pick up the dress, DJ helped us with my alterations on the dress. She was so lovely. She took us in without
us having an appointment because I went to pick up the my dress and didn’t expect to need alterations. She was sweet the entire time, explained every detail to us, and gave us time to make decisions. She made sure we were comfortable with all the decisions on the dress and checked in with us during the entire process. She made sure we (me, my mom, and godmother) were comfortable with and in the dress. She made the entire process calming and ensured us that she would take care of everything with professionalism and accuracy.

I can’t wait to see the finished product a month before my wedding! Thank you so much for the positive experiences so far.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I had no idea what I really wanted when looking for my dress. But her patience, expertise and comforting personality made this experience all so special! I left the store having picked out a beautiful dress and feel great about it! I truly appreciate it. And to the alterations dept, think her name is Ashin, thank you for all your help, can’t wait to see the finished look !!< /Text>< pics>

This location continues to exceed my expectations. Pre COVID-19 I purchased my dress and the stylist was really helpful and listened to my criteria of my dream dress. Found it during my initial appointment! Brought my dress in for alterations and wow! they did such an amazing job I was not worried or frantic about the changes, I felt very confident. Then COVID-19 happened and I had to reschedule my wedding and my dress was in the shop for four months. I recently picked it up and I have no dress regret! The ladies in the alteration department did a wonderful job! Everyone is so nice and courteous each time I visit. They were even kind enough to help me navigate a difficult mother of the bride issue. Thank you David's Bridal team!</Text>

Mainly due to the possibility of not finding a dress that I loved that was within my budget.  My consultant Victoria cheerfully greeted my mom and I and in a snap had my dress profile/favorites pulled up on the iPad. She was very conscious of my likes and dislikes and respected my budget.  With all her help.... I found a dress!  On sale none the less! The alteration specialist was very upfront and honest about the limitations of the little things I wanted to change and I think we have a plan to make me happy and have it turn out exactly how I want! I look forward to my 1st fitting in June.</Review>< user>

<Review>Love love love the experience I had with David’s Bridal. Just the people alone plus their customer service provided is great ! Everyone was so nice and professional. My alterations girl is Amazing , it’s not easy when your dress is somewhat custom. I honestly feel like she understands the vision I have in my head when it comes to my dress. She reassures me that everything will come out great and just that makes me even more excited.

<Review>The stylists were so kind and worked with my requests! I had quite a few people who wanted to tag along to watch and with that came the opinions. All appreciated, but the stylist really listened to my thoughts and feelings and took time to suggest dresses. At the end of the day, we all loved the wild card dress that she chose and ended up purchasing it! So excited to get it in the next few weeks! The store is clean and has many dresses to choose from. As well as gorgeous jewelry and other accessories. The woman who works in alterations is also very sweet and extremely informative. Thank you all for this experience! 💕</Review>< Time>

<text>I highly recommend this store!
The staff were knowledgeable, helpful & kind, from my first phone calls to Liz, to Tiffany, my AMAZING sales associate, to the head of alterations who explained my options.
I needed a dress for a semi-formal event.  Which is far outside my experience.
At this store, because of the excellent staff, I found a dress that far exceeded my expectations.
Tiffany was so kind & patient!  She asked me a few easy questions.  And pulled dresses that were great.
I actually fell in love with (and purchased) the first dress I tried on.  After trying on several dresses, so I could compare.
I will definitely recommend this store to my friends and family.
Update:  I returned to the store today to pick up my dress after the alterations were completed.
Once again, I was greeted & assisted by the wonderful staff.
The head of alterations (I keep forgetting to write down her name) did an incredible job.
The fit of my dress exceeded my expectations.
Expert and exceptional work.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c29ba09c87971b:0x890455753f16682e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Everyone at the David's Bridal in Northridge, CA were very helpful and welcoming. Victoria was my stylist and I don't think I would have chosen my dress without her! The entirety of my appointment she was patient and listened to what it was I was looking for and even brought a few styles I never thought about trying on. I'm very thankful for the support from the David's Bridal team!< /Text>

Wonderful experience at David's Bridal trying on bridesmaids dresses. The selection is fabulous (even for plus sized, which is sometimes a challenge), but most importantly the service was exceptional.

I made an appointment (90 minutes for bridesmaids) and was helped by Catalina. She was helping another group and me, but was able to give both parties one-on-one attention and went out of her way to help find me the best dress (I am notoriously indecisive). I never felt rushed or pushed in any way, and left feeling better than when I came in!

Hands down, some of the best service I have experienced in years. Thank you, David's Bridal. You make being a bridesmaid just a little bit easier.</Text>

<review>They were able to try to understand my vision for the dress and I was extremely happy with the end results. I felt nervous and trying to keep calm. The manger and her associate really went out of there way to do math and styles to give me my dream dress. Olivia, if you read this, you made my disney vision came true and you are amazing at your position and hope you go far. I can't explain how much I'm thankful and really understand and listen to my ideas. 5 out of 5 stars. Also thank you everyone else including the person in training. Everyone was amazing and fun to talk to.</review>< pics>

4 Stars for service for sure. Victoria was patient, kind, and very knowledgeable. She helped me find the perfect dress in my budget. The reason for the 3 stars is that the store really needs to be upgraded. It’s old and could use a cleaning.

They have a good selection and great staff but they really need to refresh the space.</review>

What a wonderful experience I had a David’s Bridal! I came into my appointment feeling so nervous and anxious, but as soon as I was able to talk to my stylist, all of my worries disappeared. Truly I did not think I would be able to find my dream wedding dress; however my stylist listened to everything I wanted and knew exactly what dresses to put me in! I found my dream dress, and the entire staff was extremely accommodating despite the fact that my wedding date is very soon. The alterations team at David’s Bridal was an absolute dream to work with. I cannot wait to see my dress again!<//Review>

Elizabeth didn't pressure me to buy anything at all, she wanted me to enjoy my appointment & I did. I also has the pleasure of meeting Andy & He was a pleasure to work with as well.!!!
You can tell when someone is going to work & then when someone is enjoying or even loving what they do for a living... Both of these employees LOVE what they do.

Thank you Elizabeth and Andy.! <3</Text>< gmap_id>

I went in the looks for two flower girl dresses for my daughters. One is 12 and the other is 10. Andy gave them lots of great options to try on, and we choose two very pretty dresses, different in style, yet similar enough to coordinate with the wedding party. Andy finished off their looks with matching waist sashes and necklaces. The girls felt so pretty in their dresses and were complimented the whole evening at the wedding. Thank you to the staff at David's Bridal, especially Andy who the girls loved for his sense of style and fun attitude.<//Text>

Had such an amazing experience at David’s Bridal, from searching for my wedding dress to making all the necessary alterations. The staff are SO friendly and helpful and really take the time to help you out. Special shoutout to the alterations department and DJ! She was a delight to work with! So sweet and helped me out throughout the entire alterations process for my dress. She turned the dress I chose into a dress I absolutely loved even more and I can’t wait to wear it on my big day!< /Text>

<review>This was my first time going dress shopping, so I was excited. The staff wasn't very welcoming and my stylist was rude. She told us to only try on the ones I really liked and “not to be playing around". That immediately killed our mood, especially because we were not “playing around". I would not recommend this store. Plus, they dnt have a lot of variety and they dnt let you try on different styles. How are you going to know which dress is the right one if you dnt try on different styles?</review><username>yani mir< /username>< pics>

Penny was such a Gem to have as I was searching for my Wedding dress! She had such great attention to detail, studied me so well that I literally only tried on 4 wedding dresses before I found the one! The first wedding dress she brought to me was actually the one that I ended up going home with. If I can recommend Penny to anybody I would! She made this experience so memorable, I didn’t even have to go look elsewhere for dresses! Thank you Penny for helping me say Yes to the Dress!< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>When our dresses from another vendor, who shall remain nameless, forgot our order and never sent the dresses, and with only five days before the wedding, we scrambled to find dresses for bride, maid of honor and mother of the bride.  We quickly chose David's Bridal and we each visited the ones closest be to us: Costa Mesa (MoB), Long Beach (B), and Northridge (MoH me).  We each had fantastic experiences.  As for me, Huge shout out to Victoria, Liz and the rest of the staff at Northridge.  They were sympathetic and practical.  They made a last minute appointment for me and were  ready for me before I arrived.  I was so comfortable in the level of cleanliness of the store. They were so professional and helped me find the perfect dress (we texted pics to the bride).  My sister and I are so grateful and appreciative of how David's Bridal, across southern California, helped save her wedding.  Thanks again Victoria!< /Review><username>Anna Davis Tachner</username>< gmapID>

<review>I just did my first dress fitting and Ashkhen in the alternations department made me feel like a princess in my dress.  She made me feel at ease, answered all my questions and even took pictures for me!!
Everyone has been amazing at David's Bridal from the very beginning when Olivia helped me find the right dress.
And the managers are also awesome.  I've made some exchanges along the way and they've been so accommodating.
Thank you everyone and especially Ashkhen in the alternations department.

I ended up having buys remorse and regretted my first dress. I was crying thinking about wearing it to my wedding and although it was gorgeous, it didn’t feel like mine. When I went back to let them know months later, they were super understanding and Liz and Olivia really helped me out! Olivia made the whole process fun and exciting and was so amazing. I have not stopped staring at the pictures of me in the dress and I can’t wait to see it again!</text>

I came in pretty much dealing with every bride's worst nightmare...I had originally ordered a custom wedding dress back in February from a reputable salon in Thousand Oaks only to have it take over 7 months for it to ship from the designer and sure enough, get lost in transit.  My wedding is January 11th and I didn't have time to waste and walked in to David's Bridal knowing that it wasn't a matter of want, but need and that no matter what I NEEDED to leave the store with a dress that night. Elizabeth went above and beyond to find me every possible option and was SO thoughtful and sweet when she could see how stressful the whole situation was for me. While the dress I ended up purchasing still isn't the custom gown I originally ordered, it's still absolutely beautiful and I can't wait to wear it on my wedding day! Thank you again, Elizabeth and the entire David's Bridal team for making this Bride's wedding day dreams come true!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c29ba09c87971b:0x890455753f16682e< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Appointment started off rocky and unfortunately had to get manager involved. Once manager Marisa took over she made me feel much more comfortable. I am plus size and can be hard to find things that are just right. Marisa really listened to my needs and wants. I'm very happy to say we found my dress and 2 others for my bridal party.< /Review>

<Text>Liz was very helpful. Unfortunately, my size was not available.  So I have to had to order 2 sizes bigger and must return for alterations.  I was hoping the dress could be shipped to me personally, but i do have to travel 20 miles to the store location once it arrives and then get it altered to fit.

I was looking first for some gowns online on david’s bridal. This will make me find the perfect gown easier. Once I get inside the store it was a nice and positive atmosphere as Sara greeted and welcomed me and my mom. She did very great explaining how will be doing for the appointment visit.
Janet was the one who assisted me with all the fitting and choosing. She was able to help me organize from what size, style or cut.
I got my perfect gown in less than an hour which I wasn’t expecting.
There are a lot to choose from. Very pleased with everything and everyone in the store! 😊<//Review>

Absolutely perfect. Walked in to casually browse. Didn’t even realize i would need an appointment to try on a dress. They had no openings but were able to accommodate me within 20 minutes. Karla helped me and was absolutely wonderful! Came back for alterations and Ashken and DJ were amazing. Helped me with everything. Made the process so smooth and followed up constantly with updates. My dress is gorgeous and I can’t wait for my special day!! Thank u Ashken, DJ and Karla!! The dream team!!!< /Text>

I was pretty nervous about wedding dress shopping and was worried my insecurities would get the better of me and cloud what should be an exciting time. But Trisha at the Northridge location was so kind and supportive and made it a memorable moment for my mother and I. I felt so confident and beautiful. So happy we found my dress so easily!</review>

After trying on several dresses from another David’s Bridal I was ready to give up. I was on my fourth dress and still wasn’t happy, until I took a trip out to LA. The women there so soooooo helpful and helped make dream come true. I found the dress of my dreams and I’m so happy I was able to finally found THE ONE.
Thank you!!</Text>

Start to finish I had a wonderful experience at this location! This is the second wedding I've been a bridesmaid for and gotten my dress at David's Bridal, and once again the service was stellar. Today Elizabeth did my fitting and Andy rung me up. Both were extremely friendly and patient and answered any questions I had. I cannot recommend them enough! Top notch staff!<//review>

<text>So I want to start of by saying I had the BEST customer service ever! In my life, No one has treated me so kindly .
Today I was at David’s Bridal and I was in bit of a dilemma. I ordered my bridesmaid dress from them online and received it today. There was a mistake in the order and I needed to exchange . Well I was greeted and welcomed the moment I walked in by a nice associate/ style expert  by the name of Andy!! Super nice guy, just loads of energy and I loved how he was just so on point. Well I explained my situation to him and he told me what I need to do. Unfortunately, the Dress and size I was looking for wasn’t available. But ! Andy literally saved the day, he gave me options and other alternatives. But I just wanted the dress I originally ordered.
I appreciate the fact that he tried.. 👍🏼
I did request one thing and that was if he could maybe see if customer service could do something..
And as he did that .. My best friend who is the one getting married actually had been aware of what was going on in the store at the very moment . She actually decided to take it upon herself to call customer service and they called the store. Customer Service and a Lovely woman by the name of Elizabeth (“Liz”) who works there helped out and was able to answer questions and concerns ..
I love the fact that Andy went above and beyond to make sure my best friends wedding was going to turn out Amazing! I’m so grateful for both of them. And I can’t thank you all enough.
Because where there is a will there is a way!!!
Thanks to Andy, Elizabeth and customer service I will have my dress in time.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was impressed with the staff at this store. Everyone was kind and they worked well together.  The only disappointing thing was the fact that they charge for alterations. Not only do they charge but it was expensive, basically I bought the dress twice. But I am keeping it a 5 star because that has nothing to do with the staff.<//review><user_id>107167006410970889565<//user_id>< gmapID>

It was a pleasure working with the David’s bridal in Northridge. The service was excellent when my daughter needed to try on dresses. Then when we went to alterations Irena worked with us, it was closing time and they still did all the measurements for us, they didn’t rush us. I love the automated appointment confirmations. Then picking up the dress we worked with DJ and she made the process so fast and simple. We went straight to alterations, the dress was ready and my daughter tried it on it was a perfect fit!!<//Text>

We had a great experience!  It was better than I had imagined.
I feel that I went a little to early, but at least now I have a better idea and time to make decisions on what will work for all that are going to be apart of my special day.

I regret that I did not get the 2 ladies names that were helping us.

Also, I have not seen the dresses that we selected come thru in an email, yet.

Thank you for all the help.

Let me start by saying I am a plus size bride. I had nightmares of trying on dresses... the shop trying to shove me in a size 8. but that was not the case at all. I tried on 4 dresses and they all fit me...by the way the 4th was the charm. It was perfect and on sale to top it off. Tiffany was my consult she was amazing thank you Tiffany for pulling the perfect dress. Brides word of advise keep am open mind try on different styles you never know.<//Text>

We bought all our dresses from David's Bridal , for my daughter's wedding. We all had fun and a very exciting day trying on so many clothes. We came back yesterday for fitting and alterations , the crew was very nice, professional and very knowledgeable.  They were open to comments and suggestions. We appreciate all the time,  help , patience and excellent service,  provided by DJ, Irena and Bella.</review>

<review>BRIDESMAID DRESS ALTERATIONS by DJ

It was my very first experience with a bridesmaid dress alteration, and DJ made it feel effortless. She made me so at ease and comfortable. She is very gentle, and extremely knowledgeable. Also, she made the experience so much fun! Lots of laughing.

David's Bridal: 3.5 Stars

Alterations by DJ: 5 Stars!

She's the type of employee I would love to have working for me!  It was a very pleasant experience.

Thank you, DJ!< /review>< name>

I didn’t have to shop around because I found my dress on the first visit. The customer service is top notch. Even the sales manager went out of his way to make sure I was confident in my choices. A special thank you to DJ for her expertise in the alterations. She is so patient and helpful. She really cares about making brides happy and it shows. I would reccommend that any bride on any budget shop here.< /Text>< Resp>

< review>
This was my first and only time I needed to go wedding dress shopping and I got the dress for me that same appointment! Sara at the front gave me the whole ordeal of how David's Bridal works and while waiting for my stylist, I got to look around. Karla was my stylist and she helped me get in and out of 4 different dresses that I was trying out. I appreciate her being patient with me, but she is a little new to the whole ordeal. I did not mind that. I had my bridesmaid, matron of honor and flower maid with me as well to help me pick out the dress. (Yes, there is such thing if you don't know any young girls between 3-12 years old). Once I found "the one", Porat helped me find a matching veil for the dress! I was so astonished that they had a matching veil with it. It just made "the one" even more worthwhile! They have alterations on site which makes it more convenient for making appointments. I will be coming back for shoes, accessories and whatnot.

Thank you David's Bridal for the experience.< /review>

My stylist, Lynn, was so sweet while listening to my requests and pulling dresses that matched what I wanted. She took the time to get to know me and what I was looking for.

Since day one, from finding the perfect dress to altering the dress to fit me perfectly, all of the staff has been so wonderful and supportive. My last appointment for alterations with DJ and Perry was amazing. I thought I would be stressed but it was actually fun and stress free. They were both so nice and helpful.<//Text>

I came for my first alterations fitting and it was horrible i thought my dress would be done and it wasn't. I asked for transparent sleeves and got the complete opposite, the lady DJ did my alterations and she wrote NOTHING down not even the measurements or what i told her about the sleeves. The lady DJ is the assistant manger and she’s irresponsible.<//Text>

From the moment you step in David’s Bridal in Northridge, you will definitely feel taken cared of. Andy will greet you with a warm smile. You will feel his genuine interest in finding the dress of your dreams. The staff from Leslie and Tiffany were very very helpful. I want to thank the staff here for being so patient and kind. A few weeks after I purchased my dress, I met with Ashken from alterations. Ashken is the culmination of making the dress the way you envision it to be. She is sweet yet very precise and professional and will give you ideas on how to make your dress as close as perfect. Thank you for this wonderful and unforgettable experience!<//Text>

Customer service was excellent, very helpful, and did not feel pressured by the employees at all to spend more then I could afford on my dress, very patient, and understood my budget. They did not make me feel less of importance. I appreciate that in any business! Finding the perfect dress at a price I can afford was a plus as well!!< /Text>

My overall experience was good. I had a really lovely Stylist who was able to tell me right away which of the dresses I like were in store and I'd be able to try on, as well as offering to check if other stores had the other dresses I had brought as inspiration, to see if I could try them elsewhere.
Her, as well as her manager, where VERY attentive, intuitive, asked the right questions, knew how to read me and at no point they tried to oversell me anything.
The only downside was my fitting appointment was a shared one, meaning my stylist consultant had to be going back and forth between me and another woman looking for wedding dresses, luckily one of my friends (who is already married) was there to point out and help out with things when my stylist was occupied assisting the other bride to be.
Again, service was great - just the double booking was a little awkward (but that is more an issue of the corporation and how they choose to run the business).
At the end of the evening I found my dress, rang the bell and am now awaiting for my first fitting...exciting stuff to come! :)

*****

I just came out of my fitting appointment and it was a breeze. PERRY helped figurw out all the aaoterations my dress will need and she was AWESOME.
Can't wait to go back to pick up my dress.<//review>

The item I need to try on was not available in my size. We had previously visited an out of state location with the bride and we were already in system. Employees were busy making signs and 2 other ones were assisting bride's. Therefore we received no further assistance other than being pointed to each that should have dress .no one checked up on hair anything. I understand we didnt have appointments (my sister and I) but we felt like we could have and should have received slightly better assistance.  Frustrating, especially with big purchases.</Text>

DJ was amazing at fitting my BM dress. She helped me cost down by providing me with different options. She has a good eye and a light hand. She was extremely sweet with me and the fact that I came in rushing and need a rush on this order. Thank you so much DJ!!! 💙💚💛🧡💜<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I ordered a Mother of the Bride dress back in November.  The dress was scheduled to come into the store sometime in February. When I was in the Northridge store yesterday to look at bridesmaid dresses with my daughter, I found a dress I liked better. I called the store after I got home and told Cameron my story.  She informed me that the policy says that all sales are final. She was kind enough to tell the manager, Andy my story. By the time he got on the phone with me, he had already put the new dress in the back on hold for me.

I went to the store today to pick up my dress. The other manager, Liz was working and took care of me. She canceled the original order and helped me with the new dress. The customer service that I received was AMAZING!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c29ba09c87971b:0x890455753f16682e<//GmapID></record>

The manager, Andy and his associate, Sierra were both very friendly and helpful. They listened to what I was looking for and I was able to try on several dresses. I found one that I liked but they did not have it in my size at their store. Unfortunately, I had to go to another store to try it on in my size and I ended up purchasing it. It's too bad that David's Bridal does not do inter-store transfers of their products because I really wanted the Northridge store, Andy and Sierra to get credit for my purchase.</review>

My experience as a whole at David's Bridal has been great! From Taylor being super patient and helpful when choosing my dress to the alteration team that are truly gifted at what they do. Everyone there genuinely seemed happy for each bride coming in and it was one of the least stressful things out of planning for my wedding which is always nice. The only reason for the four stars is because it could have been a little more clear on how much alterations would be even after me buying the package deal, just didn't realize my dress would need way more bustle points than offered etc.<//review>

This store is friendly and knowledgeable! Great selection and price ranges for almost any budget. Their in store credit is also easy and quick to apply for. My sales rep, Victoria, was hands down great! She really listened to my likes and dislikes and helped me find "the one" with ease!😊 I was dreading this part of my wedding planning but she made it a breeze. I felt great while in their store, felt awesome when I left their store and 3 days later.....I am completely happy and confident in my choice of gown.  Thank you David's Bridal and Victoria!<//text>

I went in to the David's Bridal in Northridge to try on wedding dresses for the very FIRST time and did not know what to expect nor what I wanted in a wedding dress and told this to my dress consultant. Elizabeth was so AMAZING through it all! She listened to what I liked and didn't like and picked dresses according to those guidelines and was patient and helpful. I didn't expect to find a dress my first time looking but Elizabeth worked her magic and I knew I had found the ONE by the third dress!! Thank you so much Elizabeth for making it such a fun and stress free process!!!<//Text>

<Review>My review is specifically for the alterations department at the Northridge location. DJ assisted me and was very kind, attentive, helpful, and knowledgeable! She made sure everything was perfect for how the dress will be altered, answered all my questions, and demonstrated great knowledge and experience. She made my first fitting a great overall experience.

The only thing I was not happy with was the price. Overall the costs of alterations was much more than I had expected. Upon first trying on the dress, I was informed there was an “alterations package” that could be added on for $299. When I came back a week later to purchase the dress, this package was gone and the store could not honor it. They had not informed me that it wouldn’t be available and my alterations ended up being significantly more.<//Review><user>112130667773872830673< /user>< gmapID>

<review>Got my wedding dress fitted at this location, and then a few years later my bridesmaid's wedding dress was bought and fitted here. It costs a pretty penny to have a dress altered here, but the service is nice and the selection is good. I can't speak for my friend, but she looked gorgeous in her dress, and mine fit like a glove. I felt beyond beautiful. Can't complain!< /review>< date>

< Review>
I had a really great time at David's Bridal and my stylist was friendly and helpful. I would have given five stars, but I was sharing my appt with someone else. If I had known in advance, I probably would have scheduled a different time but they only told me once I arrived. Having two appointments does slow down the stylist a bit, so if you're ready to get out of a dress and move on, it's not ideal.

Other than that hiccup, the stylist and manager were both amazing and I bought my dress that day!< /Review>

I never thought I would have ever get to choose my wedding dress on the 1st time shopping. Elizabeth was very helpful as  Well as a other coworker that was there (the bold guy, sorry didnt get your name).  She was very detailed about what I wanted and what I expected of my wedding gown. After trying on 3 dresses I knew it was the 2nd dress. The color i wanted was not available but i was able to choose the perfect color for my dress. I would very strongly recommend her as she was very helpful even when she had to put the dress on me. Can't wait for these months they are going to be the most anxious to get my dress.<//review>

I found my Vera Wang dress (my sister picked it out) from here. It’s gorgeous and I can’t wait to wear it!! 🤩😎👰🏻. Irena and her sister were both a great help and accommodating to mine and my mom’s requests/needs. The store manager was also a remarkable help over a slight issue with my dress that was easily resolved later. Prices and sales are awesome for designer dresses also!<//Text>

Andy Anderreg, the branch sales manager is wonderful. He made me feel very welcome & special. Very patient and attentive. Irina, a very nice lady who helped the experience with alterations very fashionable. She’s very warm & awesome. Looking for something to wear to special events can get daunting & frustrating, we need these kind of special people to make the whole experience pleasantly memorable & enjoyable. I’ll definitely come back if I know I’ll be greeted with the same warmth . Thank you & keep it up!< /Review>

Penny was incredibly helpful when finding my maid of honor dress!! The entire staff was extremely helpful and I so enjoyed their company! Ashkan is incredibly talented and altered my dress perfectly. When I arrived to pick up my dress from alterations, Perry was incredibly kind and helpful too. I will never go to another David’s bridal unless it’s the Northridge location!!</Review>

I was very impressed with the service! I was advised but not pressured! Dresses that were suggested were within my price range and they were all very beautiful! I felt very comfortable and was given plenty of time and space to contemplate my decisions. Accessories were also offered to help me see different aspects of each dress!

Victoria, at the Northridge location, was AMAZING! As I was shopping for a bridal gown, she knew exactly what would look amazing on me. Every single thing that I tried on, I didn't have on my original favorites list, but were SO fantastic on me, it was REALLY hard to narrow down my choices! As soon as I wore "the one", my eyes welled up with tears of joy. That's when I knew it was time to say YES TO THE DRESS! The entire staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Walking into the store, I had a huge fear that I wasn't going to find a dress or it wasn't going to arrive in time for my wedding... All those fears were quickly squashed as soon as I was put into Victoria's hands! Thank you so much for making this experience a wonderfully memorable one! Looking forward to my first fitting!<//review>

Jenat at David's Bridal was absolutely amazing! She was supportive and attentive the whole time and I left feeling like I had made a longtime friend. I had read horror stories about dress shopping and was so nervous for my experience but Jenat did not pressure me or overwhelm me at all. David's had a very large selection and Jenat knew exactly which dress would fit my interests perfectly! We didn't focus on the money but she kept me perfectly under budget and I never felt guilted for my limit. She was encouraging and honest! I later went to try two other local dress shoppes to see what else was out there and had such horrible experiences that I knew David's was for me. I came back to Jenat the following day and the scheduling department and manager were nice enough to squeeze me in just so I could work with her! Needless to say! That afternoon I got to say yes to the dress that I absolutely love and cannot wait to get married in. Thank you David's Bridal and Jenat for giving me the best experience during a stressful time of wedding planning! I'm coming back to David's with my MOH and we are asking for Jenat every time! I encourage you all to do the same!<//Text>

I went in 15 minutes prior to closing because I just wanted to look at shrugs (I would never do that for a real visit!). I tried out a few and found one I liked a lot. But the fit was okay, could be better. I asked if they had more sizes and they went all out to make sure I got the right size. They didn't have it in store but called the Burbank DB and asked them to hold it in the morning. Despite being mere minutes from closing they pulled out all of the stops to make sure I got what I needed!< /review>

So we went shopping for my wedding dress with only a month before the wedding (we just set the date). We didn't honestly think we would find the dress, but we thought we might get a feel for dresses we like so we could shop around. Tiffany was super helpful, and she worked with everything we gave her and found me dresses to try on. She ended up bringing me THE dress and we got it fitted right then and there. They were super flexible with my timing and found me a dress that wasn't ridiculously priced. Thank you so much!!!!#< /text>

Some very  nice sales people, manager and a hard working alterations department. They have worked with me through all my challenges as a bride to be and have been patient. The reason for the 4 stars is that it would be easier if there were more selection of veils and and cover ups and flat shoes on hand to choose from.  I do recommend  this company, just start looking WAY before your wedding so you have time to make the right decisions as sales are final. Give yourself plenty of time.<//Text>

I came to David's bridal to see some bridesmaids dresses with a couple of other ladies from our bridal shower and were welcomed from the moment we stepped in though the doors. Andy was wonderful throughout the appointment. Andy fitted us in dresses we wouldn't think to try and made us fall in love with our choices. We all walked away with a dress we would be proud to wear. Andy was patient and funny and very knowledgeable! Would reccrecom future brides and bridesmaids to this location.< /Text>

The selection at David's Bridal is very impressive and we were able to find the perfect dress for all seven of my bridesmaids. The store is quite large and many of the consultants are very friendly. However, due to the number of shoppers, our consultant was fairly distracted as there was a bride next to us she was assisting as well. The manager came over to answer any questions and gather additional sizes and colors, so the appointment ran very smoothly. Overall, my party and I had a wonderful time and will be back for future occasions!</review>

<Review>I had a horrible experience. I had an appointment at 10:30 and they didn’t help me. We were there for 1.5 hours and I tried on 2 dresses. They said they were understaffed. The person assigned to me was helping another bride at the same time and she kept looking at her watch because there was another appointment at 12.  She did not measure me, she did not bring me shoes, she did not bring me dresses in my size. She would come in to my dressing room and forget to bring a dress or if she did bring a dress it was the wrong size. I was so angry I could cry. I think I ended up helping them by leaving. I would never ever go back to this location. They apologized but did not put any effort in to rectify it. Make me feel welcomed. Don’t complain to me that you’re short staffed. Don’t offer an appointment if you’re not able to help me. I wasn’t asking for much. It was supposed to be a happy occasion, why do I want to cry?< /Review>< pics>

With my mom it was the same and the tags weren’t even attached.. made me feel I wasn’t given new ones and they didn’t want to give the bags they originally came in to me they just kept saying not to worry that they were new but honestly because hey didn’t want to give that to me it made me feel they were used... if you were to atleast open them inform of us then that would make the customer feel they are given new ones and satisfied</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1536166989565, 'text': 'Hello Carla, thank you for your feedback.

We went to David’s Bridal to look for a flower girl dress and Cameron was my consultant. She made the process smooth and easy! Not at all pushy!  Very pleased with our experience and the dress we bought! Thank you!<//review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Name>Jennifer Harrison<//Name><text>This was an amazing experience! I honestly didn’t think I would be able to find a dress as I’m not really a dress person. We were greeted  by Yanira with a huge smile and very welcoming hello. She was extremely busy but seem to effortlessly make everyone feel like you were the most important people there.
We were set up with Jenat for our dress try on and all I can say is WOW! She really was amazing! Paid such close attention to my every idea and even brought amazing suggestions to try on. Everyone was so kind and encouraging which as for a larger individual, was really important.
The rest of the staff were so great to my family including my 4 1/2 month old son that was with us! They made it really comfortable to take care of him and always offered privacy if needed for feeding him or changing him. They were very baby/mother friendly!
The only negative that I had was the cost of the alterations. My alterations could have been more then the actual dress cost, however we cut out certain alterations, to cut some of the expenses that I felt were just more extravagant then I wanted to afford.  With that being said DJ in alterations was so amazing as well. She never seemed be put off or irritated with the changes I kept wanting to make. She adjusted hems and bustles with a smile and nice conversation. She was also just amazing!
We also bought two other dresses there today for my family members and they just really took care of them.
I will absolutely go back for any other formal dress I may need. They even have a great clearance selection which is very nice if your on a budget.
Thanks everyone you really made this a truly awesome experience!!!!< /text><Rating>5</Rating><Date>1567911864965</Date><UserId.>110297867856646179669</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80c29ba09c87971b:0x890455753f16682e< /Gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

<Review>I came in last weekend for the "second" time trying on wedding dresses. I had tried on wedding dresses for the first time the week prior at another location and was very disappointed in the service and experience. I made an appointment at Northridge that same evening. I have purchased many of my prom and homecoming dresses here and very happy with the services. I walked into my appointment on Sunday very hesitant only because of my previous experience. Tiffany was absolutely the person I needed to change my attitude. She introduced herself, explained the AMAZING alterations package and we discussed the look I was going for. My bridesmaid and friend had arrived prior to me and had already discussed things I did and did not like from my previous experience. Tiffany was very quick, efficient, very compassionate, and listened to everything I said. Anytime I tried on a dress she asked me my concerns, my likes, and dislikes and took that into account before bringing out each dress. Tiffany made my experience at Davids Bridal and I am so happy to say I also said yes to the dress on this day! I can't wait for my first fitting, thank you SOOOO much Tiffany and the rest of the staff at this locations< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

This store was so helpful and considerate!! Camryn was our consultant and was so sweet. She helped with the bridesmaids dresses as well as my dress. Shes more than accommodating and truly made my experience so wonderful.

Had my first and second fitting and the alterations staff is amazing. My first fitting they made me feel so comfortable and explained everything they were doing and going to do. No surprise expenses. On my second fitting I was so late and they were pretty busy but they were understanding and still made me feel special. Amazing women that work there!!

I would absolutely recommend David's Bridal Northridge to anyone!!<//review>

I had a great experience at David's bridal. I had a small buget and my stylist, Elizabeth Monroy, was great in helping me chose dresses within my budget. My mom also had a great experience. No pressure to buy, a great selection at a variety of price ranges, and stylist like Elizabeth who are full of energy and patience and take the stress out of wedding dress shopping!<//text>

THANK YOU DJ AND ESTHER!!!!!!!!!! They work in the alterations department and they were the BEST ones I’ve worked with (I’ve had 3 fittings) they were so professional and sweet, answered every question and explained what a bussle was and showed me how to use it so my dress can go from ceremony to reception!!!!!! So excited thank you ladies! 08/27/2020

Please note that was back in October I think...LOVED LOVED LOVED Tiffany and Andy. I'm excited to have my girls come in for their dresses. Tiffany made all the difference in me choosing my wedding dress for the big day. She even showed me multiple options to made sure I tried on every style fit to my body. I'm excited for my first alterations appointment this coming February. My family loved working with Andy, he gave us soooo much information. I made the right choice saying YES to the dress at David's Bridal in Northridge.< /Review>

<review>I went in for my wedding dress alteration and was done in less than an hour. The staff was friendly and helpful. I was a little worried since I wasn’t able to find a bra or corset to wear before my appointment, but they made finding undergarments to go along with the dress a breeze. The visit was quick, easy, and didn’t break the bank.< /review>< gmapID>

Ask for Valerie, she's the most spot on stylist ever!
She's friendly, knowledgeable, and will never push you beyond your budget.

I told her my favorite style of dresses (no budget considered), my actual budget, and how quick of a job I needed (less than 2 weeks). She brought me comfortable dresses that really complimented my body, would require the shortest time in tailoring, AND fit my budget.

A word of advice: if she suggests a dress, TRY IT ON. I ended up choosing the dress I thought I wouldn't like!

$540 for the wedding dress, corset/undergarment, rush tailoring, tiara, veil, protective travel cover, steaming. I'm all set for the big day!< /Review>

<Text>The thing that makes this location special, is the store manager Andy.  She has been incredibly accommodating during the craziness that was my bridal experience. I purchased a beautiful wedding dress on my first visit.  When I returned home to Australia, I learned I was pregnant and by my choice, we wouldn't be getting married anytime soon.  Andy allowed me to return the dress when I was back in the US for a once-in-a-lifetime in store credit.  6 months later, Andy worked to help me order all my bride's maids dresses over the phone from Australia so that when I arrived at Christmas I could surprise my girls with their new dresses.  Andy's patience, understanding and level of professionalism are exceptional.<//Text>< gmap_id>

The staff was so great, the service and professionalism was great and my stylist, Sasha, was AMAZING. He knew my style perfectly! The first dress he had me try on was the one I chose!The dress is so beautiful and I couldn’t have asked for anything better!</review>

< review>
I was super excited to have my bridesmaid go here. I made an appointment a month in advance. When we all showed up it was super busy that our consultant had two appointments booked. She helped pick dresses from the rack and said she would come back to check on us. She came back after an hour later once my bridesmaids were all done. She didn't see any of my girls in their dresses and wasn't able to give us her professional opinion. She was very nice and every time I come to David's Bridal I have a pleasant experience but I was extremely disappointed this past weekend. My girls and I were left alone the entire time and when I went to go look for her she was busy. My girls didn't end up getting their dresses that day because they didn't know their proper size. That's a let down.</review>

I had a 1030am appt and wasn't seen until 1050. Then my girl kept leaving to help other people after I had to wait 20 minutes and told her I only had an hour. I still found my dress but she was nowhere to be found for pictures or anything so my mom got me out of it so we could check out. They also didn't have my size so I had to buy 2 sizes larger which will now cost more on alterations. Everyone was really nice and I love the dress, why the 3 stars. But they should manage their time better for set appointments and dedicate their time to them. Also have more sizes available. It's always 10 and up! I'm 5ft tall and petite. That shouldn't cost me more!<//text>

Went with my daughter to buy a wedding dress for her.  She had a 12noon appt. On the 30th.  They young woman who took care of us was marvelous.  She asked the style we were interested in and brought us a few dresses.  4 dresses later we had the ONE.We were done and paid for in 1 hour and 15 minutes.  There was a class training and they came to congratulate the bride.  It was an amazing experience and the young lady who was our consultant was the best, very poised, positive with a great eye for what my daughter was looking for.  Thank You.<//text>

If I could give 1 million stars I would let me set the scene 8.12.18.  I paid someone to make me a custom bridal gown.  Well how about 2 hours before my wedding the dress does not fit and is made horribly.  I'm devastated and crying non-stop.  My wedding planner says go to the nearest David's Bridal so we call they do not open until Noon my ceremony is at 1:30.  We call back at Noon and speak with Alex or Andy an Angel sent from heaven above.  He told me to come on in so me and 2 of my brides maids hightail it over to the store from the Franks Sinatra Estate about a 15- 20 mins drive we get there and the staff is unbelievable they are amazing Alex or Andy breaks out his measuring tape and he runs off to find me dressed that fit. He brings back one dress that makes my face light up but the price is not something I wanted to pay being that I just paid $1400 to have a dress made.  So Alex or Andy and a few other managers run off again they're determined to find me something they come back with a simple yet elegant dress that I can fit so I immediately say yes to the dress but I left my purse.  I was able to purchase the dress wear it out the store and only be 20 mins late to the ceremony.  I can not thank the staff enough if i could give you all hugs everyday I would thank you all for saving my day.. The Silver Dress is the Dress that I paid $1400.00 for<//Text>

DO NOT GO HERE! I felt self-conscious and unwelcome and Trisha (I believe is her name - one of the managers, pale skin, long brown hair) made sure that my first dress fitting experience was a sad one.
Made an appointment for a bridal fitting and from the moment Trisha introduced herself to us, something just felt off. She was superficially polite with her formalities, but zero warmth. I ignored it cuz she wasn't going to be my consultant for the day. Or so I thought.

Strike 1: My assigned consultant actually never arrived from her break for some reason so the unpleasant manager worked with me majority of the time. She seemed annoyed that I didn't have an exact date or venue for the wedding yet (come on, I just got engaged last week - how the heck do you expect me to have a date already?!).

Strike 2: She had the styles I had picked out online waiting for me in a bridal fitting room, but after I told her my dress budget was no more than $500, she told me to wait while she checked something in the front, and when she came back, relocated me to one of the tiny fitting rooms off to the side. That was SO rude. She explained that a certain stylist there prefers to use the room I was supposed to be in so that's why I had to be relocated. What a lame excuse. If you knew that, you as a manager should have forseen that before starting my appointment! And you could have just relocated me to one of the other unoccupied bridal fitting rooms that were available instead of trying to stash me into one of your tiny rooms where it was obviously going to be quickly overcrowded with poofy bridal dresses. (I don't care what your excuses are, Trisha. You were rude, silently condescending, and I saw right through you. There's no excuse for judgmental behavior and you can't say you didn't expect to see a negative review from me.)

Strike 3: The entire time, I felt like Trisha was trying to prevent me from trying on different dress styles. She wouldn't let me try on a dress my fiance had picked out for me so he never got to see me in it. When I was musing over a particular dress I was starting to like, she and a different stylist (who was much more pleasant) were trying to egg me to close the purchase which I did NOT appreciate. You make me feel unworthy of trying on dresses and now suddenly you want me to close a sale?? No thank you. These DB women work on commission and I did not feel good about giving commission to a woman who was unpleasant towards me and made my first dress fitting experience a very self-conscious and unpleasant one.

Luckily, I made an appointment at David's Bridal in Stevenson Ranch and had a MUCH better experience there with a genuinely kind and warm person named Mimi. When she informed me that the dress I chose was only available in my size and color from Northridge, I straight up told her I don't want Northridge to take commission from me - and we went right back to finding a different dress that would not involve the Northridge store. I am very happy to say that I found and purchased my dress during my appointment with Mimi and was more than happy to close the sale with her!

Never will I go to David's Bridal in Northridge for any of my special occasion needs again. If you want to be treated like a human regardless of your budget, forget DB Northridge. Go see Mimi in Stevenson Ranch!</text>

Thank you so much to McKenna at David's Bridal in Northridge for helping me find the right bridesmaid dress! She went above and beyond to help me feel beautiful and successful. Some people have a gift for helping people. Others sometimes make you feel like they are watching the clock tick... McKenna is one of a kind! Hope she gets a promotion soon!<//text>

They worked with everyone who was there and found someone asap to get me started. I let them know I was leaving back home that same day so I would not be able to come back for a later appt. I was not rushed what so ever into only trying on a few dresses nor pressured into buying anything I didnt want. I'm not the kind to cry like "say yes to the dress" but they almost got me. I love the girl who helped me. She made sure to find every dress I wanted in my size or in one close enough wear I can put on to get an idea. I explained the dress I really wanted and she found it. She made sure to make me feel like all the skinny girls there. I think what made me even happier about my entire experience there was I wasn't question about anything nor did she try to push me away from what I wanted. She worked hard to find the dress I wanted. She also made sure if I said no bar, it was no bra! Hahaha.... Highly recommended to go here!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>I was ecstatic to see a local bridal shop that had dye to match shoes available. I needed matching red shoes for my prom dress.

I get to the store and the lady helping me is snappy. "These are the only red swatches we have," she snarls as she pushes 4 red colors to me. I clearly saw 4 more in the glass window at the front, and called her out on it. Nicely. She didn't seem to care that she made a mistake, and pulled out those other red color swatches I saw. No biggie, I think to myself. I browsed through them, and she continues explaining the colors to me as if I'm stupid. She shows me a satin dress in the same Cherry red color, since that would be the fabric on my shoe. It completely matched my dress (I had brought a scrap of the same fabric being used for it). I thought to myself; perfect! I felt relieved and had one less thing to worry about. Despite not having a great time at the store I got what I needed, put my order in, and the date for picking up the shoes was that same week. But alas, I was wrong...

I ordered these shoes in that Cherry red color.

They came back in pink.

Pink.

You had one job, Davids Bridal. One. Job.

Sadly it wasn't enough of a big difference for me to take it back, they have enough disclaimers on the paper such as "These colors may not match your gown" and "different fabrics will appear to be different colors" Again; the woman showed me what the color would look like in the same material being used on the shoe. It originally matched my gown. The shoes came back a completely different color.
They screwed up what little they had to do for my prom - I couldn't imagine what a horrible job they would do with my future wedding. Definitely don't plan on coming back.<//Text>< time>

<Text>UPDATE: After writing the review bellow (and giving 1 star) to David's Bridal in Northridge, I called the store the next day. I had the pleasure to talk to Claudia who was more than helpful and understanding of the whole situation. Thank you Claudia, you are amazing! After a while I was able to talk to the manager on shift, Marissa, and she was also one of the best people I ever talk to. I explained my situation to her and she also explain to me what really goes on beyond the policy. So, having a clear understanding we could both agreed that sometimes we don't choose our words correctly and that this whole thing was probably a miscommunication. I want to thank Marissa publicly for being such an understanding person, a team player and most importantly for trying to help us have a less stressed process in our road to our wedding. This was something that was putting a lot of pressure on us believe or not.
All things aside, our schedule was kept, they have accommodate to help us and we are looking forward to the pick up date of the dress.  Thank you to all the staff at David's Bridal.

Old review: My wife to be purchased her dress at the Northridge location. She was happy with the girl who helped her chose her dress, she was amazing. Unfortunately, my wife got sick and could not make it to try the dress on the day that was originally schedule, May 15th. I called to re-schedule her appointment and they said they would gladly do it. That until today May 20th. My future wife got a very disturbing called from the store, on the line was Wendy, stating that she needed to go pick up her dress ASAP or she would have to send it back. According to Wendy they can only keep the dress for a couple of weeks in the store. My wife, not being sure what was happening asked her why they didn't mention this when  we reschedule the appointment? To this Wendy just limited her self to reply "you should read the fine print in your receipt". Then she tried to get my wife into agreeing to receive the dress if they were to ship it out to our house. My wife of course denied and all Wendy could said was that there are policies and she would enforce them. My wife asked to speak with a supervisor and Wendy just keep saying that she would write notes down and that if there were any problems they will call her. So, right now, we don't know if the dress will be at the store when the alterations date arrives or exactly what she meant with "any problems". We tried to contact the store via email or through a "contact us" form to not make this public, but the contact us form is non existing. So,  my dear wife to be went to this place thinking she would get a better service, better treatment than other places in LA or those "famous" streets in downtown but no, we are getting a lot of unnecessary stress thanks to the "enforced" policies of the fine print.
Just so you know David's bridal, if you happen to read this, even when there are policies that need to be enforced, there is an ethic code about how to approach your customer. Wendy has fail on that. You have fail on that for not noticing "your own  policy" when you reschedule our appointment.
You can make things right, if you want.
I will update with another review once we hear from this store or when we talk with someone.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c29ba09c87971b:0x890455753f16682e< /Gmap_id><Name>Jaime Isunza</Name><Date>1558551175952</Date>< response>

<text>Mariah was my hero today! Every time I’ve gone to David’s Bridal, I’ve never been disappointed from my dream wedding dress to multiple bridesmaid dresses throughout the year the staff and company has always taken care of me. But today!!!! Let me tell you, I ordered 2 dresses online from Azazie.com and they came and were so bad, I cried... with only 4 weeks to my best friends wedding, I was panicking and in need of a dress quick. I walked in the David’s bridal in Chatsworth/Northridge with no apt. and Mariah came and asked if we were helped.. at this time 35 minutes passed... she came up introduced herself and really listened to what I wanted and listened for the ques of style, color, cut, thickness, and movement. She went to her computer and made sure 1st that there were or was at least a couple dresses that would be in in time for August 1st this year!!! She came back with about 7 dresses... and boom the very 1st dress she had me try on was the taker. I was so impressed with her knowledge and passion that I was sold. She assured me the dress would be in no later then July 22nd in case I needed an alteration. I truly commend Mariah and hope she sees this review because she truly made me feel like a person, like a friend, and like royalty. If you ever need a wedding dress, bridesmaid dress or even a prom dress, or dress for any occasion please go see this location because they know how to make your time valued! I was only there for 56 mins. And walked out feeling stress free and relaxed and ready to take on the world. I was inspired and Empowered by there customer service. Thank you!!!! :)<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I couldn't be more thankful to Trisha from DB in Northridge. Very professional and i didn't feel pressured at all to saying YES to the dress. I came to DB with a picture of a dress that I tried somewhere else and I knew that that's my dress but the price from that place was just way too expensive. I went online and checked DB and I specifically searched for the dress that i really liked and infound it at DB for the price that wouldn't break the bank! I'm really pleased with my experience at DB and Im very thankful to Trisha for being there for me when Insaid yes to my Dress!< /Review>

I went to David's Bridal shop in Northridge today with my friend to look for a dress for my son's wedding. They were very nice at first and gave us a lady to help pick out dresses and help me to the try-on area. Found 2 that I liked, she said that we could put them in the little room. Went somewhere else to look at other dresses, but decided to come back to get one of the 2 that I liked. Went back in, got it out of the try-on room and went to the front to pay for the dress. I waited TWENTY-FIVE minutes in line with 2 registers going--1 family was picking out things to give to the bridal party and 2 other girls were paying for the alterations on their dresses. 25 MINUTES!  Many employees were walking around the store, no one bothered to say a word or offer to help ring me up. Then the lady who helped me, nice hair and VERY pregnant (think she might have been a manager because everyone kept asking her for help), rang up my purchase and said that she was sorry I was upset with the wait (but her body language and face did not show that she was sorry). Told me that I couldn't return the dress if I changed my mind.  I was trying to be nice and patient and not make a scene, so I bought the dress, but now I just feel sick about it! I gave my hard earned money to people who treated me like dirt and now everytime I look at the dress, I will remember this experience. I thought that I would have a great time getting a dress for my son's wedding, but instead I am so upset, that I would rather burn it than wear it!!  I would NOT recommend this place to anyone!<//Text>

I had a bad experience at a previous David location closer to where I live. I decided I should go to my old stomping grounds to look and much to my belief the places I was going to didnt even want let me try on a single dress they said I need to order it in a catalog...I'm like um no I wont order a dress I havnt seen or tried on so I'm out. I left those store n continued to feel the pressure of not finding a dress even though I have a year to look but was already discouraged. My grandmother insisted that we go to David bridal in Northridge, so I gave in and decided to head there with her and my mom and daughter. I walked in and was greeted right away and explained my situation to the young lady up front and she was very accommodating to me and my family and told me to take a look at some dresses I like and a consultant would be with me shortly. So I did as she said n looked around, the was greeted by my consultant Elizabeth and she was super nice and cheerful and happy to help me. She quickly took down dresses and got me into the first 2 I saw and much to my belief after trying on I think about 6-7 dresses I had fallen in love with dress #2 it was perfect. My wonderful grandma picked it out and it was perfect ! I just want to say thank u so much to this store and the crew inside for making me feel at easy and comfortable and welcomed. I SAID YES TO THE DRESS!! 🤗🤗💖💖👰<//text>

It took 10 minutes to be greeted and we had an appt.

Staff had trouble with basic things. 1st visit they did not save selections. Second visit they seemed overwhelmed and overstaffed.

The dress selection is nice. During the first visit I could not get a clear answer on shipping time frames...they said one month to six months. By this time I already had three favorites.

They kept asking the same questions over and over.

Staff was unable to email final choices. They said just have the bridesmaid come in store. Make it easy for people to buy!

I took the time to write this because I think the staff wants to do a great job but they need proper training so the staff feels confident to serve the customer.

I felt like if the dress fitter had a process the appointment would not take so long and she could better serve more customers.

Anyhow we liked to dress we ended up with but getting there was wonky.< /Text>

<review>Wish I could give zero stars!!!!!
Paid for my dress 2/9, David’s bridal made my alteration appointment for 3/10 because the dress was to arrive 3/4.
Showed up on the 10th where I sat in the back alteration room for 45 mins while people kept telling me it would only be a few more mins. Then finally admitted that the dress was never ordered!
They re-ordered it, and said it would be in 3/18 and scheduled an alteration for that Saturday.
I called just to make sure it came in and I am currently on hold for more than 36 mins and counting. They said the dress is not there and would be there 4/18!!!!!
Still waiting to speak to a manager Marisa. Completely unprofessional and incompetent manner in which this was dealt with.  The manager continued to be patronizing and ignorant about the fact they have disappointed their customer. Absolutely oblivious or just did not care at all.< /review><date>1553027814969</date><Pics>None< /Pics>< userid>

I had an outstanding experience at the Northridge location. My boyfriend and I broke up the previous day and for some reason I thought I would be okay trying on bridesmaids dresses for my sister's wedding. Walking into a bridal shop was probably the worst idea seeing as how my heart was very vulnerable. While waiting for Mari to find me another size I broke down in tears and felt so overwhelmed with all the happiest and love the girls around me were experiencing, getting ready for their wedding day and all. Mari came back and consoled me in a way I never thought a stranger could do. She had no idea what the details of my relationship were,  but gave me some of the best advice and got me laughing throughout the rest of my visit. Mari was truly an angel sent to me during a hard time. She turned a challenging experience into a positive and funny one. I am so appreciative of her, she is a great asset to your company!!<//text>

When we first arrived, it was a bit chaotic and my mom complained about the awful status of the bathrooms twice to the staff.
I was nervous the appointment might not go well but my salesperson, Camryn, had a sweet personality, great sense of style, and made me feel at ease. I showed pictures of dresses to Camryn and she knew exactly where to find them. My fitting was fun and successful. I even took a picture with Camryn.
My fitting for alterations were done instantly with Irena and she is amazing. My ceremony is in about 5 weeks and Irena put me at ease with her professionalism and knowledge.
Thank you to the entire staff!< /review>

I came in on Saturday a complete mess because i had just found out that the other bridal shop that i had ordered my dress from had not only LOST my order ( that i had placed 4 months before) but that the company had discontinued my dress within those 4 months! My wedding is in October, less than 3 months away. I was a crying mess by the time we got to davids bridal for my bridesmaid appointment. Andy comforted me after hearing what happened and squeezed me in the next day. He reassured me that we would make it work and gave me hope.
I came in for my appointment the next day and Andy worked his magic. He listened to everything i had to say and helped me find the absolute perfect dress! He completely turned what was becoming the most depressing weekend of my life into a magical experience. Things happen for a reason. Andy gave me the bridal experience that I have always wished for. I can't express enough just how important of a role he has played in my wedding. He loves his job, and he shows it. I give David's Bridal 5 stars, but there aren't enough stars in the sky for Andy. Before he had me ring the bell to announce that I had chosen my dress, he had me envision my day and my walk down the aisle then had me make a wish for my wedding and my marriage. Then came the tears.
He also found me the perfect shoes, veil (that i didnt even know i wanted until he put it on me) and corset. He is definitely my Wedding Angel! Thank you so much Andy!</Text>

I scheduled an appointment for Saturday,  March 24th at 1:30 p.m.
I arrived a little after 1p.m. I checked in and gave the greeter my name and appointment time explained to her I was looking for 2 gowns. The first one for a civil ceremony,  the second one would be a more formal wedding gown. I told her I would look around until my appointment time (1:30p.m.).
1:30 I asked the greeter of I would be called by my stylist, she said she gave her my "name card" and I should be called any second... it's now 1:40p.m. I approach her and she looks puzzled asking the lady she gave my "Name card" to what was going on... Well she had another person that she took that was not me, the greeter tells her "This is Marcy"  they start whispering and I hear the greeter ask her to take me. I then ask why this is a problem, I made an appointment, I waited for my appointment time and now this is happening?! This set the mood for a bad experience.. the girl then took me to the fitting room and asked what types of dressed I was looking for.. she helped me find a gown for my civil wedding but when out came to the more formal wedding gown,  they didn't have my size (14) I tried on a size 12 and 16 but I really wanted to try on the size 14. I would not commit to purchasing a gown I hadn't tried on,  I asked her if she could call the Santa Clarita David's Bridal to see if they had it I  stock but the only one who had a size 14 was Ontario.  I asked the manager of the stores would send the dress to the Northridge store and she was a little rude in her response. It seemed like she just wanted me to order it blindly.  I will not do business there for my second gown,  I'll just wait for the first one I purchased that day and look somewhere else for the second gown.
I thought this would be an exciting, fun experience.  What a disappointment.<//Text>

I am not a shopper and I have no fashion sense, in fact I am not naturally comfortable in the whole arena of finding a dress.  I have been looking for a month for the perfect Mother of the Groom dress.  I even had a mini "meltdown" before arriving at the shop, because I thought I would never find "the dress".  The coordinator set me up with Alvaro, an AMAZING young man with so much intuitive fashion sense.  He heard what I wanted, found numerous possibilities for me, and gave me feedback on each one as I tried it on.  He was patient while I waited for responses from pictures I texted to the family.  He was knowledgeable about how dresses should fit properly.  I also noticed how he interacted with other customers.  He knew how to deal with charged emotions and family tension that surround wedding decisions, and seems to enjoy making everything go well. I was impressed and was surprisingly very comfortable.  As I was checking out, I was able to meet Andy, the store manager.  What a devoted and dedicated man.  I could tell that, just like Alvaro, he loved his job... helping people get what they need for their wedding, with joy and peace!  Thank you!<//Review>< user>

Large selection compared to some others I have visited but the poor girls working appointments were scheduled multiple people at once and so we had to chase down our stylist to get dresses. They also did not have a good range of sizes for some dresses. My friend asked to try one dress and they only had size 2 or 22 to try and she's right in the middle so it was impossible to know what it would look like. I ended up not buying in store but purchased online later.<//review>

<review>I had an amazing experience picking out my wedding dress at David's Bridal this past Sunday! I came in not knowing what to expect as this is all new to me! Camryn helped me through the process and she was so amazing! I told her what I thought I liked and she was able to pull up my online David Bridals account where I had Favorited dresses. She pick out a bunch for me and I started trying them on. I fell in love with the 2nd dress she brang to me! We tried on a few more dresses with different styles and colors to make sure that was the one I wanted. Camryn was amazing! Thank you Camryn and David's Bridal for helping me find my dream dress! Highly recommend them for your wedding and bridesmaids dresses!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

we were done with finding my dress, she introduced me to Irena who took charge of my measurements and alterations, she was amazing too! She explained everything in detail, was very friendly. You could tell she had a ton of experience with alterations.

<rating>2< /rating><review>I came here looking for a simple white dress and the staff was not very organized. I was told that I had to have an appointment but walk-ins were welcome. I was then told that another appointment didn't show up so I could fill the spot but then they said that the bride walked in and they can have me come back in 30 mins. I said I just want to be directed to try on a simple white dress and was then told that I'm not allowed to try anything on without an appointment after pulling two out on my own. I felt like I wasn't being taken seriously as a bride just because I'm a bit younger (I'm 20yrs). Overall had a bad experience and just ended up leaving the store. I don't blame the staff or think they are at fault, I just hope they become a little bit more organized and better with communication.</review>< pics>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>First of all I would like to say Tiffany is amazing.

But above all this has been a horrible experience. I picked out my wedding dress back in November 2017 at this location. My first fitting was in March 2018. We agreed to getting the dress hemmed, taking in at my lower back, the amount of bustles, the dress taking out a little under the armpits, add a small belt, sew in the under garments, and added little padding to the bust of the dress so the chest appears more rounded than triangular.

We ordered the under garments, the belt and paid for ALL alterations in FULL at my first fitting in March.  I also asked alterations how will you add the belt and under garments if it’s not in store and she assured me that when the order comes in she will add those items on the dress a few weeks before I come in to my next appointment, she also added if any fine details needed to be done when I come back in it won’t be an issue.

We schedule the second appointment for June 7 at 4:30 pm. The ladies knew and understood my dress should be completed for that appointment as I live out of country. That was also the reason the alterations were paid in full.

Yesterday, my mother, myself and two of my bridesmaids were able to witness the confusion, disorganization, poor communication, and excuses after excuses amongst the employees. After 3 months of David’s Bridal having my dress, the only thing completed was under the armpit and  the adding of the padding so the bust looked round.

This is now where it all went down hill. Instead of the ladies agreeing and saying yes we made a mistake, or misjudge, or even saying sorry. It was excuse after excuse.

First it was “you gotta order the undergarment and belt” my reply was we did back in March. And to add to that my mother was forced to pick those items up because of policy, although David’s Bridal has the dress those items are being added to.

Second excuse “we back in alterations don’t know when things arrive, we don’t communicate with front desk”

Third excuse “it’s a harder dress to alter we want to make sure it’s right”

Forth excuse “we usually don’t complete the alterations before it’s paid for” my mother’s reply was it was all paid for. At that moment I was able to tell the lady in sales was just as confused as us.

Due to the fact that I’m out of country I had to an additional 64$ US to put a rush on my dress, which also led me to changing my flight and extending my trip to have the dress completed next week when apparently the dress is a hard dress to alter.

I am truly astonished that my dress sat for 3 months with alterations with minimal work done to it, and now it can be completed within a week.

Compensation for the troubles was not offered, a simple I am sorry from alterations was not given. However the lady at the front I believe, Rebecca did apologized but also explained it is out of her control.

Giving that I’m out of country i’ve  ordered from David’s Bridal back Home to keep everything within the same company and I’m having issues there as well with locations of my bridesmaids dresses.

My mother was going to buy her “mother of the bride dress” yesterday at my appointment, and unfortunately for you after our experience she will no longer do such thing.

To conclude, buying my wedding dress should have been a beautiful experience, reasons why I flew to another country to share this experience with my mother and my bridesmaids came with me and this has turned out to be the worst experience of my life. I will not be recommending anyone to buy from your company.

<review>I had an amazing experience at this David's Bridal! My consultant, Mariah, hit it out of the ballpark and brought me several dresses I absolutely loved. I fell in love with the first dress I tried on! I came dress shopping with some friends while I was visiting from out of town (so I wasn't ready to buy just yet), but Mariah was so lovely and helpful. I'm planning to buy the first dress she had me try on back here in Denver. Thanks Mariah and everyone at this David's Bridal, you made my first time wedding dress shopping a real pleasure.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I am very happy with my experience at David’s Bridal. They only got 4 stars because when I first went for my appointment, there were a few appointments at the same time and the girl was too busy to help or address anything. Good thing I was there with a friend who had previously worked at David’s Bridal and helped me out instead. She brought over the last dress I was trying after being rushed that the appointment is over (started 20 minutes late btw because they were too busy with helping others). I loved the dress my friend brought and decided to come back to try it on again with my mom. Later that day I got another appointment and this time, the person helping me was amazing. She ran and got me dresses because it turned out my dress didn’t fit after all. I was too much in a rush with the first person, she didn’t even tell me the dress didn’t close in the back. Anyways, this girl brought so many dresses for me to try on and had such a great attitude.  Didn’t make me feel rushed at all. Her name is Marisa! The manager was there and was very nice and friendly and had a great time trying on clothes with them and talking.  They were both amazing ladies. Can’t remember the manager’s name but she had recently moved to the area from Orange County.

Anyway, we finally found the dress and it was going to be the one on the floor. They had to just see the buttons on it, tighten some loose beads and spot clean. When I picked up the dress, everything was done but the cleaning. I didn’t have time to ask them to clean, minor things on the inside of the dress. But once I took off the dress and got dressed, I saw dj, disappeared. I was the last customer. Then I heard her calling me and she was working on the dress. She said she wanted to make sure nothing fell off anymore and was sewing and making sure everything was done properly. She said about 30 mins after she was supposed to leave and sat and sewed the buttons on more carefully and sewed on additional things to ensure I was completely satisfied. I didn’t even ask her for a thing! She was very friendly and I loved chatting with her while she was sewing. By her doing this, I was ok to overlook the fact that they didn’t clean my dress. Btw, I saw on her note that was stuck to my dress that only button sewing and tightening was on her to do list. Someone else didn’t write the spot cleaning on there.

Overall, I am happy with my dress and my overall experience! Thanks to all those that were patient and helped me through this.</Text>

I went to this particular David's Bridal twice, both times to look for a wedding dress for me. If I had just gone once and stuck with the first dress I had found (and put on layaway) this review would have been a lot more negative. The first trip I took was with some of my family and my bridesmaids, and I have to say the service was not very good. The lady I was assigned to help me find THE wedding dress helped me pick out wedding dresses but as soon as I was in my dressing room she disappeared without any communication. My family members tried to help me zip up the dresses and put clips on the back but I really needed help from the women I was assigned to. I would see her every once-in-a-while helping other customers out (even though I thought she was supposed to be helping me out) and she only came over once at the end when I was deciding to put one of the wedding dresses on the layaway so I could make sure I really wanted the dress. It was disappointing and I told myself that I did not want to come back to David's Bridal again.
However, I called them a few weeks later because I didn't want the dress I chose (it wasn't THE one) and the manager I spoke to was very nice and helpful, after talking with her I scheduled an appt. to come in and look at some other dresses to see if I wanted trade the dress on layaway with another dress. This second appointment was wonderful. I had such a great experience! I requested a different associate to help me and Mariah was fantastic! She was bubbly and seemed genuinely excited to help me find the right wedding dress for me. If she had to go help another customer she let me know and was constantly checking in on me and made sure I was given the attention that I needed. When I found THE dress she brought over one of the women from alterations (who was also super nice and was very knowledgeable)  to help me make sure my dress would turn out exactly the way I wanted it. When everything was done the manager Emily was so nice and helpful as well. These girls really made such a big difference and celebrated with me when I found THE dress. If you go to this David's Bridal I recommend you request to work with Mariah.< /review>

<Review>I went to David's bridal and had Jenat(ju-net). It was my first time trying on wedding gowns. She listened to my style,vision and budget. She was sweet, real, personable and helpful. And most of all she wasn't pushy or snooty or rushed me in any way. (Having had worked in bridal a bit myself...this was huge for me! I hate pushy people.) I HIGHLY recommend Jenat. She's extremely good at what she does. Overall my wedding dress experience was thoroughly enjoyable:)</Review>< Resp>

< review>
WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!  Ive never felt so discriminated in my life, I made an appointment , and had to wait an extra 30 minutes because of the unorganized schedule.  On top of that wait, i said I wanted to try a certain dress, and it wasn't two dresses after that the consultant brought the dress I wanted in the first place. I believe since the dress was less than the original dresses she brought, she left me out and started helping another bride to be with her bridesmaids. I was ready to speak with her about alteration when  I walked out because I was left unatended. never did I mistreat  or give attitude to anybody there, even after everything that happened. THIS WAS THE WORST FEELING!!</review>

Awful! I was so excited to be going in to find a wedding dress. I had a style I wanted in mind but I wasn't totally committed to it. From the moment we walked in, things started falling apart. The bathroom was a disaster: no toilet seat covers in either holder and the paper towels were sitting on the back of the toilet. The chairs for my wedding party to sit in were torn up: the vinyl was cracked and split and the padding was coming through. The consultant that was helping us was stretched over 2-3 parties and altough I was there before the others and shopping for my wedding, I came se on to a party of teenage girls shopping for prom. She would disappear and leave me standing there for 10 minutes waiting for her to help me out of the dress. Very impersonal and seemed rushed. I definitely would not recommend going here.</review>

I went to this bridal shop because I literally went everywhere looking for a simple, short, wedding dress. I could find nothing in the malls. My MOH suggested I go to the David's Bridal right across the street. I had almost run out of options so I decided to go as a last resort. I was helped by a lovely blonde older lady, which I wish I could recall her name. But she was AMAZING! I believe the most wonderful thing about looking for dresses is when you are being treated like the princess you will be on your wedding day. It was alot of fun trying on dresses and having her opinionate on the dresses I was trying. Her charisma was great and extremely helpful when looking for something in my description and budget. Also the other staff that was present on that day were very helpful as well. They went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with what I was wearing. The dress looked amazing and I got many compliments. Like I said, I wish I knew her name but she was very helpful. Great place to go to.</Review>

<Time>1515017741782<//Time>< review>
WORST experience of my life ! They don’t even deserve one star ! Very unprofessional! All they want is your $$$. First of all I ordered a Vera Wang wedding ball gown that costs me over $2,000 dollars and it was given to a different person without any type of identification before walking out the store with MY dress! I was fortunate enough that the person who took it brought it back to the store after a few days ! BUT my dress then had a huge black shoe print on it. Second of all I paid over $550 dollars in “alterations “ all it was, was a basic cut of the dress length and my bra stitched into it. The moment I was putting on my dress the day of my wedding BAM! Stupid bra ripped off the right side -.- it literally was hanging by a thread on my left side all day causing me to constantly adjust my bra which was the point from the start of why I paid to get it stitched in. The length of the dress was left too long causing me to constantly step on it with any kind of walking getting me very irritated. AND to top it off two of my bridesmaids we’re measured wrong and they’re dresses were 2 sizes smaller than needed! Therefore they had to PAY EXTRA to get a small corset done in the back of the dresses. Overall it was horrible service and I wouldn’t recommend this place to ANYONE!<//review>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!
I regret going to Davids bridal they were the worst seens the beginning I loved a dress that I saw at Davids bridal and I knew it was the one! So I decided to get it after all there rudeness. Days after I was making payments on my dress they were blowing me up EVERY SINGLE DAY saying my dress is discontinued if I didn't pay it the day they said so I had gone to make a payment and they told me I couldn't make payments but in the phone the manger will tell me another thing and I will come and the manger will be the one helping me she would always say she never said that my dress had to be paid full amount I was very upset and she started saying if she should cancel my dress which that got me more upset so I just left and the phone calls started again I had finally finish paying my dress because I was being rushed saying I won't get it on time when I finish paying it I got my dress in 20 days which they lied about saying I won't get it and when I went in to pick up my dress onces again the manger was helping me and she's SERIOUSLY THE WORST!!! she try's acting all nice but she's a real pain I was waiting in the fitting room for 30 mins no one EVER came until my mother in law told them that's when she came and I was already done and I told her I needed to bag my dress and she just gaved me a bag for me to do it so I told her if she can do it and she's like yeah bring it to the front she was being lazy! DAVIDS BRIDAL IS THE WORST PLACE
I wrote this review like 7 months ago and I just want to leave a quick comment again the manager had told me good luck finding someone to fix your drsss well guess what!!! I did found one and $400 less than what you guys were charging me!! Never go here waste of money and waste of time!!! Especially the Mananger< /review>

I am from Colorado and had to order the right size from the northridge store. They got to me on time, however, they were disgusting, dirty, and had been worn and had threads being pulled out. It was disgusting. The woman we then talked to on the phone was rude and unhelpful until we spoke to a manager after being placed on hold for several times. We had to then get the shoes ordered on rush from the warehouse so hopefully they would get here by my wedding date however, they never did call us back. We ended up having to go to the davids bridal half an hour from our house in Colorado to order but they couldn't get them here so to avoid the problem we had to get the shoes that were too big and then go buy inserts so they could fit. These shoes are the most expensive shoes davids bridal has to offer and thus you'd expect kind costumer service and top of the line shoes but instead we got this. It was inconvenient, very unprofessional, and a disappointment. we will NEVER be shopping at Davids bridal again because of it and will suggest to all our friends to go elsewhere.</Text>

She wreaked of cigarettes the entire time she helped me in and out of dresses and constantly breathed on my face throughout the whole process. Every dress I tried on felt cheap and was not well made at all! Then every time I didn't fall head over heels in love with the dress I was wearing my consultant would get upset and annoyed acting like I was wasting her time. When I told her that I had to leave for an appointment she got even more upset and visibly annoyed with me.

They took forever to ring us up for our dresses they were all over the place , they talked about eating and going to the bathroom more then they were to help us find a dress. I found my wedding dress myself by walking around ,at one  point me and the girls I was with were just setting around and no one was helping us because one was at lunch and she was super hungry and the other had to go to the bathroom .< /Text>

When I walked in no one said hi, no one smiled, and I was in the store for a good 10 minutes looking for a simple white dress and no one even asked to help. The service is HORRIBLE< /Text>

<text>When I picked out my dress I tried on a size 2 bcuz they didnt have a 0 which is d size I usually wear. So i ordered a 0 bcuz 2 was a little big on me. After about 3 weeks I picked it up since it was delivered to d store, but didnt try it on knowing it is my size.

I tried it on at home after 2 days and my mom, who was helping me at that time could not zip it up. So i thought it was tight for me and i need to exchange it for a bigger size. So I called in to exchange it a size bigger. They told me to bring it in so that I can exchange it; the lady on d fone even told me she put the size 2 on hold for me, which is nice. When I brought it in d next day the consultant that was assigned to me was VERY RUDE! As you know a consultant is supposed to be able to help more than 1 bride at a time (but no. "Red-carpet" treatment on that bride while almost putting me off to d side making me feel she shouldnt have been assigned to help me). She told me she doesnt even think I need her. I tried on d dress and showed her what d problem was. When i put on d dress she was able to close d zipper up. And she rudely said with a raised voice "maybe its just a matter of getting used to a corset type of clothing!"

Yes it was my bad that I thought the dress was rlly tight and thought I ordered a wrong size...but no need to be rude!

Most of the employees here are also discriminatory. They are very nice to others, like they give them a "red-carpet treatment". But they were very rude to others. You know becus they greet others with a face with smile up to their ears, and they greet others with a straight face.

I just think they should be more respectful. Whether the bride need help on picking out a dress or fixing little problems like that you should still be respectful.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c29ba09c87971b:0x890455753f16682e</GmapID></record>

<review>My daughter was looking for a prom dress.  She picked out about 15 to try on and she didn’t like any of them.  She was frustrated and upset.  Then one of the associates, I don’t remember his name, saved the day!   He brought two dresses he thought she would like and boy was he right on! Not only were they perfect dresses, but the dress she selected was on sale!  What a deal and an amazing experience!  Thank you David’s Bridal.<//review>< Pictures>

Jesse Jackson was awesome! The rest of the staff was awesome! They stayed perfectly (even under) my budget while still delivering the best quality dresses. He made the experience so fun and relaxing! I found the one here!</Text>

1 Star for my first appointment. My experience finding my dress was great and I had an amazing stylist.

Every alterations appointment after that was terrible. It was rushed, there was HORRIBLE communication, and after 3 alterations appointments the dress was still not completed (even though I was told it would be completely finished after the 2nd appointment.)

1 more Star for the attempt to fix the situation. After explaining my situation to multiple managers they had me come back in. The alterations manager fixed the issues with my dress and the store manager did give me a 10% refund (off of the alterations) to fix my "bridal emergency".

As a first time bride - I am glad my dress is fixed but the experience I had with alterations was terrible. If you are going to David's Bridal, my advice would be to get your dress here but GO ANYWHERE ELSE FOR YOUR ALTERATIONS.</text>
