A loyal customer here! I am deeply impressed by how they handled their customers correctly with no hassles at all. I really like my new hair cut now! All of my requests were addressed and provided instantly. I am very happy and contented with the results. I never thought this barbershop would be this effective and professional to me.</text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>The service is #1 and you feel right at home when you walk in. Highly and I do mean highly recommended to create an appointment online before coming. Plan ahead, as barbers fill up rather quickly and it could be up to 5 days or more for some barbers to see you.  I have had the pleasure of having two barbers Santi and Frankie. Both are amazing with putting the customer first. They listen to what you want, offer their professional suggestions and go to it. Have left both times with a great cut. The spot is cash only and parking can be hard too in Virgil so be prepared to walk, but it is with it.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFfjgKvST6yjHNTwomO_m4WnY20oBLd1pp1Z1Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPPSQsuYelHq9vhxfraF_fnIkYoWPsY18ONHHF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I came here to get a trim and I must say that this barbershop provided me an amazing experience. Ariel gave me excellent treatment from the fade to the trim up top, hot towel treatment, hair rinse, and neck and upper back massage. You really have a great service!< /review>

This is another top-notch establishment. First barbershop I've ever been that offers you a cold drink or beer while you wait or getting a haircut. The staff members are friendly and nice to talk with. I waited maybe two minutes before it was my turn. The guy did a top notch job on my hair. I highly recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

EXCELLENT! This barbershop deserved the best recognition possible because of its amazing services and barbers. It was these guys that managed to handle my buzz cut hairstyle that I requested, and it was nice because their barber was able to do it perfectly. Truly amazing and a must-try service!

I love the ambiance, also the experience was great, and different from my usual cut. Have been getting my haircut here for years and they never ever fail to give an excellent service. The staff is very friendly and polite. They also sell haircare products if you want to. I am super happy with the service. Highly recommended place.< /Review>

I visited this place with my husband for a few days and I was impressed by how many barbershops you have, here men do take care of the customer's looks. My husband's barber was Dave and he knew what he's doing. The cut was really perfect and the hair products they used are of good quality. You can get for free coffee here while waiting for the haircut to finish. I have to say they totally fulfilled my expectations< /Review>

I got an amazing hair cut from this awesome barbershop. I am very happy with their performance. All of my requests were done as they promised me. I was not expecting Alex would be this reliable and trustworthy from the beginning until the end of the service. A five-stars satisfaction rating for you! Try their services and you won’t regret it for sure.</Review>

Nice staff, great atmosphere and great haircut. Especially after a couple of days it really grew well. It was expensive though. I was charged $40 for a haircut, no beard, no wash or anything (then I tipped too because I believe in tipping). It's my fault for not asking the price up front as that is out of my budget.< /Text>

This place is cool. I love the barbers because they are both skilled and chill. This is the best barber shop in Los Angeles! Every time I tell people I am going to vinnys to get my haircut people think I'm going to an Italian mafia barber which is funny. I love the haircuts I get here. Don't forget to make an appointment because it's usually pretty full here.

EDIT: Sad to hear this place is permanently closed.
I will miss coming here!<//Text>

<text>After moving to LA recently I spent a lot of time reading reviews on Google trying to find a new barber. Every listing has reviews claiming that they give the best haircut in LA side by side with others talking about the disastrous cut they received. But I can honestly say that my experience at Vinny’s was nothing short of perfect.

I made an appointment with Omar using the very easy to use (even on mobile) website. As mentioned in other reviews parking is indeed hard to come by, but it only took me about five minutes to find a spot that was just a few minutes walk away. There are two front doors to the place, but the one to the left has a small but comfortable waiting room. I was delighted to find a truly old school barber shop, with smartly dressed men in white smocks and shiny shoes giving all kinds of guys all kinds of haircuts.

Though I was early I didn’t have to wait long for Omar to greet me warmly and ask what I wanted. I’ll admit, my descriptions were vague as I was used to seeing my regular barber and never having to describe what exactly I wanted. But he listened intently before getting to work quickly, and soon the floor around us was covered in hair. It was a hot day and I have some social anxiety, so I was sweating a little more than I would have liked, which I know can make giving a close fade a real challenge. But Omar was great, stopping every so often to dry my hair and face.

When I put on my glasses and he held up a mirror to show me his work I was amazed at how good everything looked. He gave me exactly what I wanted, perfectly shaping my hair and beard to highlight my best features. The cost was very reasonable for the quality of work received, but keep in mind it is a cash only place. I will definitely be back for my next cut, happy to have finally found a great barber In my area. Thanks Omar!<//text><UserId.>112969645770324727761<//UserId.>< Date>

One note: street parking is tight, so make sure to plan a little more time and perhaps a bit of a walk. But trust me, the time is worth it, and the walk will do you good!<//Text>< GmapID>

During my visit from out of town, a friend recommended this spot. I was able to schedule a same day appointment easily through their website. When I arrived, I was promptly greeted by staff and shown to my barber, Santiago. I got exactly what I was looking for and their level of service was excellent as well. Thanks guys!< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Been going here for about 4 years now and they keep me coming back. Classic barbershop feel and everyone is chill but gets the job done. You can tell that Omar (the owner) really works hard to find great barbers and even gets guys new at the game up and running.

I've been seeing Brian there for about a year and a half and the guy kills it every time. Other places just buzz up the sides, take a few hacks at the top and call it a day. Brian always pays close attention to the way my hair is growing and takes off exactly what's needed to make sure it all goes where it's supposed to. Nothing worse than your barber taking off too much at the wrong spot and you can't even put enough product in it to get it to not stand straight up. And too be honest, all the guys in there do a great job.

Even after opening up more chairs, the place gets booked up often. They take reservations online now though so it's easy to check out when you can go in for a cut. As long as I'm living in LA, I'll be going to Vinny's.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c74546ea15f7:0xf1eb6f60532b3290<//Gmap_id></record>

One of the best barber experiences I've had. All the guys are accommodating, have interesting stories, and, most importantly, give a great cut based on how you want it. The electric shoulder massage at the end is legit. Place is kept super clean, and they stock a large number of pomades/gels. Best way to book a time is through their online web app.</Review>

<Text>Today was my first time coming to Vinny’s, and it was hands down the best experience. I’ve been hopping from barber shops to barber from SuperCuts to Floyd’s and I never had a cleaner razer fade. If you have a chance, go to Eddie! He’ll make sure you look good. Even gave me advice on what hair product I should go for.  Cash only, but it’s great in price!</Text>< Pics>

Awesome place! All guys are friendly,  and the vibe inside is great. I was nerves because it was first time I went not to my usual barber shop. But Carlos did a great job. And when I just asked him a question about my beard(after the haircut was done and I was about to leave) he said that can fixe it fast right now for free. Thank You guys so much. For sure I'll be your regular castomer.</review>

<text>Best barbershop I've been to in my life. Awesome guys, clean and stylish cuts, and a great old barbershop vibe. Only downside is that parking can be tricky. Plan to get here early and you will be rewarded both with a parking spot and a beer for your wait.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Love this place! Been going here for a while now and I am never disappointed. This place here will always give the best haircuts by far. I had my hair cut by 3 different barbers at vinnys and they were ALL awesome. I trust my hair with anyone there because the staff is great and I know they all know how to cut hair very well or else they would not be working there. If you are having seconds thoughts, don't. This place is all the hype and a must go for a great cut.

The price is reasonable, not very cheap, nor expensive. But u definitely get an awesome cut and I know you will be coming back here forsure.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

GREAT place....GREAT barbers
I don't  go anywhere else

their reservation system SUCKS though
you can't get ahold of them on phone or email
and when you use their online reservations, you scroll and scroll looking for your barber and an opening
You can't just look at a day and see who is availible
You can't just type in the name of your barber and see when he's open.|

Worst barbering experience in a while. This is not a barbershop for blacks. It does not even look like I got a haircut. On top of that he had the gull to charge me 30 for practically a shave. In addition I was in the chair for a hour and 15 minutes. WARNING STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHOP!< /Text>

Super friendly staff, and they were also very generous with the portion size. The ramen tasted amazing and the seating arrangements inside were setup nicely and more private. The music was also really nice, felt like a very early 2000s type place!< /Review>

That is totally not Japanese food... It tastes very bad, and only accept cash. I don't know how can they get 4.3 starts on Google. The only good thing is cheap, but all of the restaurants on Ocean ave are not pricy. You can get better one in this area.< /Review>

<review>The ramen here is among the best I’ve had, even considering my two trips to Japan. The broth is infused with rich flavor. There is a complex well prepared meats combined with different flavor of sauces. I can tell that many ingredients are slow cooked over a long period of time before coming together in the ramen. That being said, the space is a bit tight and the atmosphere could use a bit of improvement.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6b7KtqClLb_acyKTqd7YB6a2SBTkpFHwQAk4e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808f7dd332698087:0x7b5f02b4eeb592f9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Surprised by how taste the ramen was. Tried the house special and it contains a decent spice level. Perfect for a cold night. Friend tried the black garlic ramen. Both came with pork slices and soft shell crab. We also ordered some potstickers and karaage. The karaage tastes disgusting. Everything was delicious except for that...avoid ordering it!<//Text>

<Text>Tasted good, but gave me food poisoning. I had the pork ramen bowl that they said was popular.

Was looking for a good ramen place in the area, found this place with great reviews. About three weeks ago. I sat down when they opened and the whole time I was in the restraunt no one else stopped in so I kind of had a bad feeling about the place. Long story short I got very sick, woke up every hour the first night I was sleeping and then after about a week my poisoning was gone. I decided to ask for my money back for the first time ever and the lady in the front was rude even though I kept my voice down so the table right next to us wouldnt our conversation. I left, was told the manager would call me and no call.</Text>< Date>

To be fair I have only tried their Shoyu ramen, but I've had it 3 times now for a reason. The meat, the broth, their noodles, and medium spice is just awesome. Their beef feels like it melts in your mouth, and their broth is not as thick as others but I like it better that way. Really good ramen spot< /Review>

This place is a hidden gem in the middle of the city. I can notice the chefs care about the taste and presentation of the ramen, every detail made it worth it. I ordered the place pepper ramen and I had to leave half of it to go because the portion was really big! The waitress is really attentive and joyful. Would come back and recommend 100%</Review>

<review>Good enough place if you're hungry. Flavor wise I don't know why this place has so many high ratings. Beef ramen with pork was decent. A tad bland honestly. Takoyaki bland that for the last 3 balls I just fished out the octopus. Garlic edamame had more flavor than everything else really. Lol. Oh and the chicken karaage was dissapointing.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Best ramen I've had in SF so far. Cheap price and the portion is huge! I couldn't finish mine dish and had to take home the remaining. You have to check out this place but be careful cause it can be pretty crowded.</text>

<Review>I believe they have the most authentic Japanese ramen in at least 7 miles radius, maybe even the best in the entire North bay area. Price is reasonable, worthy for the outstanding quality of the food. If I have to pick some cons, I'd say parking is a bit of pain since it's right on Ocean ave. I normally parked in the Wholefoods parking garage from right accross the street. Overall, I love this place! Recommended!< /Review></record>

I started coming in for the flavorful Tonkotsu Ramen and eventually ended up craving it at least twice a week. Fresh ingredients, lovely staff, good prices. Lucky to have this place in the Ocean area!</review>

Tiny little place but good ramen. The menu is really large, you could go for weeks and not eat everything.  If you're in the area you should check it out. As authentic as it gets.< /text>

Ordered the age tofu and the vegetarian ramen. The age tofu was fried to perfection, but needed lots of seasoning. The vegetable ramen had lots of fresh veggies and was good, but still needed quite a bit of soy seasoning. I understand that ramen is traditionally seasoned with portk, but if you are gonna have a vegetable option, it's important to make it tasty as well.<//review>

<Review>Decent ramen joint, but certainly not the best in taste or ambiance. The service is ok, its a small place so you're unlikely to get unnoticed. Everytime I pass by, there isn't many people eating, though never empty. The food choices are limited, nothing unique and takes a bit of time to be served. The portions are really big for some orders. Flavor wise, it's ok, Decent ingredients, better than average taste. In short, good place for the hungry, not my first pick for the ramen connoisseur.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808f7dd332698087:0x7b5f02b4eeb592f9</Gmap_id></record>

We saw the review and had to check it out.

Definitely didn’t disappoint.

Loved the tortillas both corn and flour were a 10 - Homemade !

Their rice is perfect.
Carne asada a 10.

The burritos are Beast Mode Huge :)

The only knock is that perfection takes time - so 30 mins for our order.....but quality is worth it.
On our return we will order ahead !</Text>

<Review>The food is authentic, and there's a variety of Salsas which is my favorite! This restaurant is literally a  2 in 1 restaurant, want dessert after? They have your favorite "antojitos", ice cream, chips, you name it! If there is an antojito you would like but don't see it on the menu you can request what you like and they will make it for you! Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley! I most certainly recommend this restaurant!<//Review></record>

This is definitely a must on my food map and should be on yours, hand made fresh tortillas make a huge difference in the experience. Had chicken, carnitas and goat birria w cheese tacos and can’t say which one was better as they all were too good to choose a winner. Funny how you look for the best taco in LA but end up finding it in the desert. Can’t wait to be back!<//Review>

If “tortillas echas a mano” (handmade tortillas) doesn’t get your attention, let me tell you, the food here is absolutely AMAZING! So good. The salsas, the sides, all the options taste like Mexican food, authentic Mexican food should taste like. We discovered this place on our way between Phoenix and Los Angeles. What a gem. So good, we hit again on the way back! Definitely my new spot when traveling through.</review>

Excellent food, good selection of beers and wine--including the margaritas, and gluten-free items clearly marked on the menu. Gluten free empanadas (the picture doesn't do them justice) and bitter orange barbecue wings (gone before I remembered to take a picture)!< /Text>

Great casual outdoor dining. The food is on point, and they have a nice beer selection. Corner spot at the counter is a great place to grab drinks if its not too crowded. Hangover soup does the job with tons of flavor. The brunch scene is busy with cool looking trendy people.... if you're into that sorta thing.<//Text>

This restaurant was fantastic!!! Great food, great service. My experience was excellent, the environment of the restaurant was very lively and upbeat. I had the wings as an appetizer, which were lovely, and enchiladas, which were fantastic as well. The only weird thing is the tiny tables. This restaurant is very thoughtful with their flavor choices and the result is a well-rounded, palate-fulfilling, great-tasting meal. I will definitely be back.< /Text>

<Review>I was SO impressed with the decor here, it was almost distracting. Nice job, designer. Once we decided on what to eat, everyone was even more impressed with the food. I would recommend the veggie tacos, the pizza and the barbacoa tacos. The salmon tacos were my least favorite. The chips are super fresh and salty.

The small, round, marble tables on the patio serve two purposes: they are a place to eat and a host to a rousing game of musical dishes. You have to finish a dish before they  bring the next, simply lack of space. That sure kept us entertained!

It's a noisy place, but a good spot to try if you're in the area!!<//Review>< pics>

<review>I am a Venice / Santa Monica local and enjoy coming here for the 3-6 happy hour. I always get the mama's ceviche - which is great and a 32 oz corona, which they bring out in a champagne bucket for you to keep chilled while you drink it ! You can eat and drink outside on the front patio which is great on warm days and nights.< /review><date>1456531183448<//date><user_id>116027849148084134344< /user_id>< Rating>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Resp>None<//Resp><Review>I've been here a couple times for lunch, and while I was satisfied both times, the quality of food was inconsistent with each visit. Don't get me wrong, it's good food, but if you go there more than once and want to get the same thing again you might be surprised with the results. Maybe it's because they just started lunch service and they're still working out the kinks. I dunno. But the large beer selection, unique appetizers, and diverse menu are definitely worth checking out.< /Review>< pictures>

Some of the cheaper food should actually be cheap I almost want to say tacos are like $7 for one.... it's tasty I'm guessing they have to compensate for the super high rent.. thanks landlords.. drop the prices a little bit and get a full liquor license...soju marggy? not doing it for me< /text>

<Review>Never been treated so badly by staff and owner. My friend had his birthday here and they overbooked the private room which he already put his credit card down as a down payment. They told him there was nothing they could do, even though on their reservation list they had my friends name printed. Then the owner told me friend he could leave the restaurant. Then we got out Food which was mediocre. I had the fish tacos. They were cold.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Beware if you are thinking of going here for brunch with four or more people!

I have been many times to Oscar's as a party of two, and have liked it.

But, today I had a reservation for four people, and they stuck us at a two top. When I asked to be seated at a four top, the host told me that they do not do that anymore. All parties of four have to squeeze into a table for two so they can fill the restaurant to the gills...even when the two top next to us opened up. What did they do? They told us no, and sat another party of four at the two top next to us. Everyone in both parties were uncomfortable.

When our food came there wasn't enough room on the small table to hold all four plates. It was completely unacceptable, and the host did not care less.

They screwed up our food order, and two of the four had to wait for the kitchen to remake our meals while the other two people's food got cold.

It's too bad because I used to like this place. But, today will be the last time. The two people who had to sit on the stools on the passageway were continually bumped into throughout the meal.

For a brunch costing $100,  we should not have to have been told "sorry" a total of seven times when we told them about the food mix-up, the fact that we were feeling way too cramped and when we waited forever to have them pick up our credit card and run it so we could get out of there.

Sorry never felt so insincere.<//text>

Looks like a hip place, but apparently, my wife and I and two teenage daughters were not hip enough. When we arrived at 7:45 PM, famished and looking forward to a good meal, the the pretty young brunette hostess proceeded to look past and through us and receive two younger patrons ahead of us. She did not even acknowledge our presence or ever speak to us, even though I was standing directly in front of her. Finally, her (somewhat) older counterpart came forward and put us on the waiting list, claiming that it would be a two hour wait for a party of four. This seemed hugely exaggerated given the level of business and what we overheard being told to the people taken before us. It turned out to be true as we were texted in a little over an hour that our table was ready, an hour less than the rudely delivered estimate of two hour wait. Luckily for us, we had already eaten at another nearby restaurant - The Firehouse - where we were greeted warmly and enjoyed a great meal with great service.< /text>

Nice place. A bit hip but it is Rose in Venice. Had very tasty huevos rancheros and agua fresca. Can get very busy at lunch.</text>

Big, homey dishes, the most professional and friendly service alone brings us back and you can smell the ocean from here -- a fun hangout and place to eat and drink</review>

<Review>They sat me down and ignored me. No service at all. Got up and left. Not busy at all. Employees standing around talking. Maybe servers shouldn't make so much per hour. Things are different when you have to work for it.< /Review>< Pictures>

I've honestly never understood why this place is so crowded. The food is eh, yet very pricey. They have good wine selections, though I can't say it's worth the wait in such a noisy place. The atmosphere is kind of cute, buts it's dark And you can end up cozy to the table next to you when it's busy.<//Text>

They only got one star cause you have to put something.!. But if you want the nastiest that Sacramento has to offer it is a great place to be. From the cock roaches to the rats to the awesome black mold that grows in the trailers. The management is the biggest joke ever from not speaking English when convenient to not having a clue about anything so she says. But she's real trailer park as well so go figure. Larry is the owner and Martha is the manger which makes them very special people to charge for a dump like Almondwood Trailer Trash Park. Trailer trash of different shapes, sizes, and colors.< /Text>

<Review>Quiet Park, Great for Retired people who love kids, it's family friendly Park with some pets allowed, a great place to buy, or rent, with a strong Management team. I have never had better neighbors, we all watch out for each other. Kids feel safe and can play with confidence because so many homes have surveillance, as well as the office. Only one way in keeps your home safe.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This place is a dump, cock roaches crawling on the outside of the mobile homes, manager, Warner won't spray, hard to get him to make any repairs to the rentals, kitchen sink faucet has not worked for more than a month.</text>

<review>If you intend to bring a pet or wander anywhere other than inside the tennis courts, you're going to be contending with crack heads & drunks that use this park for various purposes - for sales, use, as a urinal, etc. I'd really, really, really recommend that you do NOT come here to let your dog play because crack heads let their pit bulls/large dogs have the run of the place & it's really not worth the risk or aggravation.

The tennis courts are right next to a very busy intersection & highway. Not many places with worse air quality.<//review><name>Scott H</name>< rating>

The courts are always in use, we waited about 15 mins around 5pm on a weekday. Courts are in good shape and next to another court, two in one place as most parks. Very noisy area due to the 101 freeway being so close.</text>

<username>Sapat Lang<//username><Date>1557053657388</Date><Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Free to play. Parking is limited you may need to park along temple street.  Courts need to be washed regularly. News balls will apear old after just one game due to the amount of dirt and dust on the courts. No restrooms except for porta potty whcih is not well maintained. Homeless and marijuana sniffing personalities are at arms distance. But they are friendly. 5 doubles court and one singles court. Weekends and  late afternoons to evenings are busy.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL9XOgMJmBBUBfFO_ZDkOgoQBpQgkKBST1W3M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3hfU3BeRBurFuNjr-NlZ2wt5HqOHtxmLt9b0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuc1W6B7Vivv1cqIMmbWQWagCtQvxkjUGrjww=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPco5zpCMUYRVJlUUrC6yXBQXoVrTR7x_QhGR4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSrg7Ldh0Zjs0TaPl-8aPca6V3rePuqmCRYAQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c704261d4cbf:0xee128a62577e5090< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

There are 5 courts here that are free and open to the public. They are first come first served. One strange thing about this small park is there is no parking lot at all, just street parking.

The courts themselves are decent. Some of the corners could use some cleaning, due to trash left behind by others. There seems to be a few homeless people/loiterers nearby but not threatening at all. A cool feature of these courts is the view of the DTLA skyline. If you don't like noise, the 101 freeway traffic may be a disturbance, but I was able to block it out. I would definitely play here again.</text></record>

<review>It's nice when you get there at a good time . A few courts . Sometimes there's always a court or two open upon arrival. Other times, several families are there.  It's great to see family outings. Benches located on the courts and outside the fences too. 1star off because no backboard, and there's space for it to be built< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c704261d4cbf:0xee128a62577e5090<//Gmap_id><time>1480232632353</time></record>

Friendly staff and a fairly expansive beer menu.  The food menu looked tasty, and the dishes we saw coming out were definitely appetizing.  I just didn't actually try the food, so I can't really guarantee that.  The decor is really nice and it has a great open feel.</text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>An excellent place to go grab a craft beer.  Very friendly staff, knowledgeable too! Not a very loud place,  so having a conversation is possible without yelling lol. If you get hungry,  the food is excellent as well.  Try the crepes they are my favorite!  Tacos are great too.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>First timer. New owners. Finally looks open. Mon to Thurs 12 to 10. Fri to sat 12 to 12. Sun 12 to 6. Food was good too. Kids allowed. Enough tvs. But the beer selection is best around for us craft beer lovers.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

"Don't get around much anymore" but when we do this a favorite place. Unique offerings of bar food, trio of tacos was very good! Selection of microbrews was outstanding and they offer some good stouts which the Scotsman appreciates a  lot. Joey's place offers some local talent that was very good -even original tunes mixed in that showed promise in the real world! Open after 4 so don't show up at noon. =)</Review>

This is now our "go to" pub. Great rotating beer selection, great small plate menu and no rowdies. Very friendly owners, four big screens, a pool table, 12 seats at the bar and a couple of tables. Occasional "Pint Night's" with live music. Check it out!</Text>

Locally owned place. Nice owners. Kind of a smallish choice of brews on tap, maybe 12 plus a couple ciders? Most choices are IPA's. They have tvs, jukebox and pretty good food. Have not been disappointed in the items I've ordered. Chill vibe. Check it out!<//Review>

Some tents have much better produce than the local grocery stores at slightly better prices. it's well worth going.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Only one question: why did not we start coming here long time ago?  Feels so great to buy fresh, local, tasty and very often save money.  Very nice atmosphere, no problem with parking.  Just try the bring cash.</review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>This is my favorite farmers market; over the years the number of vendors increased; product variety improved. You can find anything from eggs to flowers, cheese, drinks, ready made food, of course fresh vegetables and fruits. The farmers market provides opportunity to live the seasons via fruits and vegetable each season brings. The vendors are always happy and helpful; the samples are fun.</Text><user_name>mediscover style</user_name></record></dataset><record>

There were so many shops but the coolest part was being able to walk outside and up onto the bridge like dock and look at the golden gate or even back at the Port of San Francisco signage.

Really cool place - didn't end up buying or eating anything but it was worth following through on the recommendation to see it!< /Text>< Pictures>

The Laguna Niguel Farmers Market has a very good blend of farm grown produce and fruit as well as healthy alternative products. You can buy fresh bread there, grass-fed beef and even fish. But the best part of the market is the avocado oil vendor, AVO-CO... they sell California grown avocado oil and flavored balsamic vinegars. They alone make this Market worth visiting!</Text>

Very small farmers market but fun. Prices are a little high but the vendors are all pleasant and unique high quality items are available. Open Sunday until noon.</Text>

Great little market.

Plenty of parking and it's not too busy, so you can usually get what you need easily.

There is an awesome selection of vendors too:

Coffee, fruits, vegetables, nuts, yogurts, breads, juices, essential oils, pastries, tamales, soups, seasonings, flowers, succulents, eggs, kombucha, everything!

Starts at 8 am and shuts down at noon, so it is a great way to kick off your Sunday.</review>

When I go to Costco I skip buying veggies & buy them here instead. My fave tent is the 3 for $5 organic bunches. Mix and match bunches of kale, arugula, chard, dandelion, and a variety of other greens!< /review>

<Review>Huge theatre great for parties or perfomances. Has bathrooms upstairs, a bar to serve drinks. It has alot of stairs so if anyone is disabled it may be a difficult venue for them as there is no wheelchair accessibility or no elevators for disabled.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

This place sucks no A/C so its hotter than hell.To use the restroom you have to walk a fleet of stairs and when you get there a horrible place to go let's just say you'll end up seeing what the next guy left behind this place needs to get shut down< /Text>

I made an order through Doordash, I ordered the Super pack and it says add Beef Stew for $1. I added it. A few minutes later she calls me saying she not giving it to me because the price is incorrect. I didn't choose the price, they do when they add it to the app. She argued with me saying it's Doordashes fault and she's not giving it. That's something she needed to correct with them,  not me. I told her I would call them. Next thing I know Doordashes customer Service calls to confirm that I'm canceling my order?? WOW really?? Very shady restaurant!! I would not eat there or support them if they can't correct issues with a company they are doing business with!!! Alicia, learn some customer service and don't take your issues out on the customer!!! Again don't eat at China Cook, very rude and horrible customer service!!!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Had a large order. They would just help customers coming in instead of on my order. This is ridiculous. I was waiting 45 min for my order</Review>

We usually don't eat @ restaurants that serve pre cooked food but we eat here because the close proximity to St Rose. Hence the 3 stars but the service is quick, the staff are friendly and the seating area is clean.

Everything is tasty but we usually have the grilled chicken, which is tender and juicy. The chow mein is fresh with crunchy veggies.< /review>

<date>1617406141355<//date><Review>(Translated by Google) I love eating here at least once a fortnight, I always ask the same thing but I wonder why on the ticket there is no breakdown of what they charge me once I saw that they charged me even the small container that had sweet sauce. It should show the prices.

(Original)
Me encanta muchisimo comer aqui al menos 1 vez a la quincena ,siempre pido lo mismo pero me pregunto por qué el el ticket no hay desglose de lo que me cobran una vez vi que me cobraron hasta el pequeño contenedor que tenía sweet sauce. Debería de mostrar los precios.< /Review>< name>

<Text>This a great place to visit and get in a good walk at the same time. There are people teaching their children how to fish and sometimes the children catch a fish before their parents do. The atmosphere is very calming and sometimes I have bread to toss to the seagulls. I believe more fish are caught during the day as opposed to the evening, but there seems to be a consistent  group of people who fish late at night.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

We drove for a few hours to get to Cabrillo Beach, but it was worth it. The beach was clean and the kid's playground was in really good condition. The restrooms were clean and it has soap to wash your hands. We walk on the beach and collected a few beautiful rocks that have fossil on shields. It has some benches to sit on with an amazing view.</text>

A water inside of harbor is flat and great place to safely practice paddle board and other marine sports.  Atmosphere is very mellow and people are nice.  Bring your chair, sit back and relax.< /Review>

<text>This place is great for fishing. It can get busy and a little crowded but it's always fun. It has a pretty long pier and parking is not to expensive. We usually catch fish every time we go out. Mostly mackerel bit a few other species too. If it's not mackerel then more than likely you're going to have to throw back whatever you catch. They're not the healthiest to eat but there is some good fish out there too that you can definitely take home and cook for dinner. And if you go on a Sunday evening you can watch the cruise ship leave.</text>< pics>

Just went yesterday 8/2/20 its real rocky, the water is not clear, the waves are pretty strong and it gets steep real quick I was scared to let my 4 year old play on the beach although there are lifeguards on duty...the pier is closed causing there to be more people on the beach and packed side by side along the closed pier for those that are trying to fish... oh yeah and fyi no one is wearing a mask...visit at your own risk< /text>

The pier has throngs of visitors who lack respect and common sense. The facilities are disgusting and unhygienic. The lifeguard towers are decaying; the county should invest in better facilities for their employees, as they work very hard and deserve better. Don't go here if you want to avoid COVID-19: no one wears a mask here.<//text>

I luv this local gem of a beach. Someplace to go for a quiet moment to give your troubles to the sea. A nice place to take friends, family & lovers to create memories around a blazing fire pit. A magnificent open secret at the edge of L.A. with enchanting views in every direction. Worth the drive for a day trip.< /Text>

The pier has throngs of visitors who lack respect and common sense. The facilities are disgusting and unhygienic. The lifeguard towers are decaying; the county should invest in better facilities for their employees, as they work very hard and deserve better. Don't go here if you want to avoid COVID-19: no one wears a mask here.<//Text>

Just went yesterday 8/2/20 its real rocky, the water is not clear, the waves are pretty strong and it gets steep real quick I was scared to let my 4 year old play on the beach although there are lifeguards on duty...the pier is closed causing there to be more people on the beach and packed side by side along the closed pier for those that are trying to fish... oh yeah and fyi no one is wearing a mask...visit at your own risk< /text>

<Review>Love it down here... But a little advise... Most of the  parking meters or pay stations are supposed to take cash, but they don't or won't cause not working.... So bring your debit or credit card... They do accept those still...  Lol         great spot though... Aquarium /museum is located near by and the beaches are easily accessible.</Review><user>101203060146540935528<//user></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Going for a walk 🚶 is so relaxing, you could choose between two sides of the beach 🌴one you could see the boats 🚢 and the other one has a better scenery 🐬  and it has a pier where you could go fishing 🎣.< /Review>< date>

It’s super windy which is good sometimes if you like the ocean breeze, the downside , there’s not that much waves water is murky, and there’s tons of seaweed floating around which can be very annoying if your trying to have a good time .</Review>< pictures>

Always a good place to fish has really good spots and will always be a place for me to chill and have fun. They do charge parking so have that in mind when going. I went last Thursday and caught 4 mackerel fish good descent size too. They are really good deep fried with a bit of salt lemon and tapatio.<//review>

There is a spot at Cabrillo Beach that I never knew or saw until my friend, Amy took me there. It is at the end of the beach road, you park and walk past the lifeguard tower that is on the right, and walk straight ahead and there beyond the rocks is this sandy area that is like your own  private beach. When it is low tide this spot is exquisite.< /Text>

It's a fishing pier for serious anglers. No benches except under the awning( which is a popular spot) no food stands and there are porta potties.  So bring your snacks, chairs and patience and enjoy the sun and sea air.< /Review>

This is a great place to go for a walk, hang by the beach, or go fishing. There is a decent amount of parking. Public restrooms in a historic building. Nice views of the harbor.< /Text>

This place rocks but depends upon what you're looking for. If you want to go fishing this place is really good. The best time to go fishing is late nights and evenings<//text>

We maybe go 2-3 times a week. My borfriend on the other hand "lives there". I enjoy going because they have a beach side that has no waves. Theres a kids playground. An aquarium in the same location.
I would give it 5 stars but the restrooms are always an issue with me. Its says they won't close until 10 but when I go to both (by the playgrounds) they are 93% of the time closed. Ive walked by around 4pm and their closed.. Oh but not the mens.!! Women have bladders too.!!!! 😒👊<//text>

Save your time. Go home. This place is disgusting. If you're going to try fishing bring at least three different fishing rods. The water is so ugly and filthy that there is no way that I would eat whatever I caught of that dirty water. I was simply toss the fish back in don't want it don't need it in that case I would rather go fishing elsewhere. If you have nothing to do and you want to stare at a dirty ocean come here stare at the people stare at the fish you catch cuz that's all you want to do here the water is so dirty. The location is ugly I don't like it I'm not a fan of this place at all. I don't want to return here anytime soon.</Review>

It's pretty here with a light house and a background of hill side houses.  There's a museum too that you can check out, but you can't fish here because there signs that say it's toxic to eat.</text>

<text>You can catch just about anything here. Bass, barracuda, different perch, sculpin, and many different sharks. You can occasionally see a sea lion and her pup or a pod of dolphins with their young or maybe if you're lucky, you'll get a close encounter with a whale calf like I did today.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Good for taking a walk.  Not so good for fishing though since there are so few fish there and you do not want to consume any fish you caught here.  The place looks down since last oil spill years ago.<//review>

This is a nice place to forget about stress. At $1.00 per hour parking rate is really affordable, the place is well maintained.</review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) A jetty!
Because it is rougher than the jetty with the Takamatsu red lighthouse
I could feel the sea a little scary because of the high waves.
You can only enter the car halfway (there is a car stop)

(Original)
正に突堤！
高松の赤灯台のある突堤よりも荒々しい作りなので
波が高いせいか少し怖いくらいに海を感じることが出来ました。
途中までしか車は入れません（車止めあり。）</review>
