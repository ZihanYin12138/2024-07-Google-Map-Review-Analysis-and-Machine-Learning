Great soft grilled fish and shrimp tacos - we found this place by accident.   The tacos were great. All fresh topping on the tacos.  The guacamole was good as well.  Chips were not included w the guacamole,  but it was ok only $2+.< /Review>

<user_name>Nathan Delaney</user_name><review>It's been several years since I've been here.  When I lived down the street this was a go to spot and always got a Downtown Burrito.  They went downhill for a bit with their other (since closed) location on santa Rosa.

But they have done a great job making super fresh food.  The food is better than ever and they make it how you want.  Their menu only said breaded fish but we asked if they could do grilled.  They did and it was so good.  It should be a regular menu item.  Also it was great to find out that they prep and cook it there in house.  Great local restaurant with super fresh and delicious food.<//review>< pics>

I just purchased 2 Giant Burritos $13.99 each and it was 95% beans and rice and 5% meat. I was really disappointed and I would not recommend anyone to go there if ur looking for authentic Mexican food.<//Text>

<review>TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!
I walked in around 9:30PM: 1/26/19 and smiled at the cashier. She didn't even look up at me and said "we're closed." Super rudely and abruptly. I said "oh, I thought you guys closed at 10? " ( that's what the website says)
She looked up and said "um its 9:34?" And scoffed and said she wouldn't serve us. She acted like I was stupid or something for coming in well BEFORE closing. I have worked in customer service for a very long time and I have never been treated so rude by a customer service employee ever. If they were closing early then that's fine, tell me nicely.  I didn't know they closed until I was stopped at the door and scolded.The door wasn't locked and there was no closed sign.
I am pregnant and I love eating here because the food can be great. But after this I'm  not sure I will ever come back.</review>< Pics>

Went there for their daily special consisting of 2 delicious fish tacos under $10 breaded fish of course and it was delicious! People were very hospitable there and most of all, they have a laundry list of delicious options to choose from!<//review>

<review>first time-friendly service-prompt-great tasting food. would give 5 stars but didn’t get full on 3 tacos. 2 shrimp one carnitas-street style-messy-overflowing-all good,  but didn’t fill me up for $10. order 4 or maybe i’ll try a combo plate next time-chips are extra $. so for a full lunch you wont get hungry on w a drink and chips its not really that inexpensive as the single ‘$’ indicator would lead you to believe.<//review>< gmapID>

<Text>We came at 9am and they weren’t open. The door was open but the lights are off, when we inquired to the man in the kitchen he said “maybe 10?” Maybe lock to door and put out a note of apology? Fortunately nautical bean is next door and delicious!</Text>< Pics>

I ordered a Chile Verde plate ahead of 6 other customers. My food came out after theirs, and was half the size of the other same item orders plus on a halfsize plate. I'm not sure what happened, but I'm never coming back.  I gave it 5 years of chances, because it's a block from my house. I hope you figure it out before you go out of business.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<time>1467941068333<//time><Rate>4<//Rate><review>Taco Roco is a decent Mexican food place. It's not our favorite in town, but it's convenient. They have a decent vegetarian burrito that is rather healthy (does not use any cheese or sour cream), but it's not the most amazing vegetarian burrito in town. My husband really likes their breaded fish tacos. Their staff is generally pretty nice, and they do have some decent beers available for purchase. Their chips and salsas are generally very good, so make sure to get some of those!<//review>< pics>

I’m a truck driver so I eat all over the place but this has to be one of the best burritos I’ve had in a long time. the rice was delicious the beans were fresh. The meat was so flavorful. the sauce you have to try that green sauce it is delicious. I’m very glad that I took the time and headed over there on my break< /review>

<review>The place was small with Indoor and Outdoor seeting. The place did have a small salsa bar with a chip bowl under hot lamp. The chips were not complimentary had to pay .50. Can I say Nickle and Dime you. The Food was a little bland for my taste,but when you are hungry.
It's one of the better Mexican restaurant in SLO. IMO it can certainly do better.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><GmapID>0x80ecf0bfb94c46b5:0xbaea5a81b0909742<//GmapID>< Time>

The food that my friends got did look apetizing though, so if I got actually food my visit would have been more enjoyable.</Review>< pics>

Accidentally found this place. Value for your $$ is exceptional. It's quick, friendly, nice and portions are generous. Somewhere between a Taco Bell and a fancy Mexican restaurant. Give it a try!< /review>

Tacos are supreme, grabbed drinks next door then grubbed down at Roco.Id guess their delivery is top notch as the food was very fresh.<//Text>

The beef or chicken chimichanga is all  refried beans. Not much meat. Five of us sat down to eat four of us got our food 10 minutes later the fifth person got their food.organization food quality really not up to par chimichangas are supposed to be crispy on the outside they were mushy.<//Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>They're consistent. I live across the street so that's where my loyalty stems from. The service is up and down. Tacos are really the only thing I get here. My usual is the al pastor tacos paired carne asada tacos. Because. Their salsa bar is pretty standard although their green salsa is hella tasty. Kinda sweet and refreshing with a small tinge of heat kind of like me.<//text>< pics>

I was surprised how tasty & fresh it all tasted...I had a beef crispy taco & a carnitas soft---both fillings were good but I preferred the crispy version...
PS - you should remove the offensive racist review from Alfonso Cervantes (Ponchito?) who said never trust a Mexican! (But what can you expect from a guy that prefers take out from Olive Garden?)< /Review>

My wife and I wanted to celebrate my birthday on May 29th at Taco Roco. We  knew it was a holiday so we went to Taco Roco on Friday May 26 to ask if they would be open because of the holiday and we even asked if could bring a cake and seat in the back patio at 5pm. They said no problem and yes we will be OPEN!
Well, Sorpresa!! my family and I arrived at 4:40 only to find out that they closed at 3pm.
The next day I went in to speak with Narsi the owner but he was not there, they ask for my name and phone number to be contacted by the owner but nobody called me yet today is June 3. I wanted to talk to the owner before posting my review but after a few attempts with no answer I've decided to post this not so positive review. Nothing against the food because we eat there all of the time but I think that communication fell big time!
At the end we decided to go back home and order take out from Olive Garden.

Never trust when a Mexican says the salsa it's not spicy or when they say they will be open on Memorial Day!!!!

< Review>
I dont get central coast mexican food, so cal Taco shops wont dare filling thier burritos with rice and beans, unless thats what you want. I recently tried to order thier " steak " burrito without rice and beans and it was so rediculously small, i felt like making a scene. What this mexican food ignorant area needs is a 24 hr Albertos, to put these greedy, no value giving restaurant lords out of business.< /Review>

What a superb and kind group of rescuers at TAPS. Our beautiful rescue dog Dempsey has been so cared for by the truly nurturing Bonnie, who has answered so many of our questions. If you're concerned their fees are a little high - don't be. They cover vital surgeries and vets' trips during the fostering, and ensure you are comfortable with the pet as well as the pet being happy with you. They really do want the best outcome for the saved animal. This small organization relies on donations: they don't have the facilities of a large shelter - and we were alerted all along to the costs. We are SO glad Dempsey found us through TAPS. And we would wholeheartedly recommend them to others - especially seeing how shelters often find an animal's new owner through lottery. Not here: it's true care. Thank you!< /text>

<Text>I adopted my doggo in 2014. Porter was one of 9 puppies that were 5 weeks old! The mother dog was on site so I asked to meet her. I climbed into the x-pen and observed the puppies for about an hour until I settled on "Dallas". He was playful and also fell asleep a lot. LOL

They were nice enough to meet me halfway to drive Porter to me since I live in San Diego. I appreciate that they send out a person to do a home inspection; that will ensure that puppies/dogs are placed in a safe environment. Porter is now 5 years old, healthy and happy!< /Text></record>

They understood that we needed an older dog, not a puppy.  We are first time pet  owners and they communicated with us to find the right dog.   Really appreciate the fact they they were still available to ask questions especially, as stated before, we are first time pet owners.  I assume the service will be even better when COVID-19 Safe at home order is over.<//review>

I adopted a sweet little kitty from TAPS. Everyone was wonderful to work with, and I can tell they love animals and want them to have the best homes possible. The pets at TAPS are vaccinated, microchipped, spayed/neutered, and in happy and healthy condition. Dedicated volunteers help find them homes. If I had room for more cats I would come back!!!</Text>

In the concerns that you raised, I think there must be a mistake because I just re-checked the paperwork from the shelter medical staff and it says "heart/lungs sound good" and it also notes a DOB (date of birth) as 8/25/17, which would make him just about 1 year old when you adopted him on 9/6/18.  We aren\'t sure which paperwork you are referring to, but we would love the opportunity to review it with you.  Thank you for being so devoted to this dog and for believing in the mission of adopting an orphaned animal.'}</Resp>< Name>

First I want to say everyone was extremely friendly and helpful when we had issues arise after adoption, and second that we love our dog. They also referred us to a trainer after the first one failed and we really liked his methods and they’ve helped a lot. But I feel wronged and can’t go without mentioning the not so positive parts of our experience.

We adopted our dog 1 year ago. We were told he was about a year old, and that he was a stray captured by the pound. We had to pay a relative premium for such a “young” dog. We knew he hadn’t had any formal training yet, and that we’d have to take him to classes which we were fine with, assuming nothing was too engrained after just a year. We were not told, however, he has a heart murmur and would be severely limited in exercise. After we specifically requested a dog that would be capable of longer hikes. Not the end of the world, frankly. What was more challenging, is after we received his paperwork from the shelter, there was a note that he was owner surrendered and was listed as 4 yrs old! That by itself is not so bad, BUT he had ZERO training, and he has severe anxiety about other dogs (we noted we live next door to a dog park and he would be frequently near other dogs). We’re realistic people and we know this all can’t possibly be vetted (pun intended) prior to adoption, but all of these issues stacked together, along with paying a premium for a dog they had documented as being 3 yrs older really has not sit well with me, especially with the few hundred dollars in vet bills to treat a heart murmur that’s existed his whole life.

I would not necessarily recommend against adopting here, but after seeing some other stories and having our own experience, I would definitely say to be cautious and thorough when considering a pet here.</Review>

<review>We are thrilled to have adopted our second friend from TAPS! This time we brought home a kitten and he is so happy here with our previous adoptee doggos. I have had nothing but a wonderful experience here as an adoptee and and volunteer. We know the animals here are taken care of with the utmost respect and love. Happy to support an organization doing the very best for animals who deserve a shot at life.<//review>< date>

Laurie and the entire team at TAPS and Operation Adopt were simply wonderful to work with! When we found our girl online and fell in love, they worked with us quickly and professionally to unite us as a family. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to help give an animal a second chance and a happy home. Thank you, TAPS, for making our lives so much better!< /Review>

Wonderful Animal Rescue group!  Super local, and you can meet the animals any time they are open instead of having to apply sight unseen like so many places!  The place is clean and nice, and the animals are well cared for!  Plus you can tell how much they care about each and every one!<//text>

So many people want to adopt but can't bring themselves to enter a shelter - it is just too emotionally upsetting.

We are proud of how clean we keep the facility - it keeps the animals healthy and lets people meet them in a pleasant environment."}<//Resp><Pics>None</Pics>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Aside from being wildly over-priced, my biggest concern was that the owner's son didn't like the dogs barking so he would tell at them and spray them in the face with water while they were caged. If you can't handle dogs barking, don't work at a pet rescue. This person seemed untrained and inexperienced in humane animal care. If he did that in front of me, what was going on behind closed doors? It wasn't a good sign. There is another worker there who was very kind and gentle with the animals. It seems these rescues are running a bit of a racket: $700 for a dog? Hm. I love the pup I rescued from the rescue, but I wish the staff was required to have proper training. For that much $$$ they can afford it.

UPDATE: I was mistaken that it was the owner who I had initially talked to (it was a volunteer's son, not the owner's). The owners just called me and said they would correct the problem and speak with the seasonal worker who was spraying the dogs. They sound genuinely concerned. So if you go visit, hopefully things will be different. It sounds like they are open to requiring actual training by any staff working with the animals. Hope so!
The dog I brought home does not seem traumatized or mistreated. He loves people and is friendly and wonderful.</Review>

{'time': 1549986476155, 'text': "Stanya, thank you for taking time to address your concerns.  The Animal Protectorates is a nonprofit animal welfare organization so there are no owners - but staff and a generous group of volunteers who give freely of their time.  Your review deals with 2 separate items - adoption fees (which you feel are too high) and how you may have perceived treatment of the animals at the center.\n\nDuring our conversation, I explained that the reason Operation Adopt is different than other small rescue groups who are home-based or who conduct pop-up adoption events on the weekends is that we have a physical facility.  Running a business like Operation Adopt includes staffing, insurance, rent, worker's comp, utilities, supplies, collars, leashes, harnesses, food, vaccinations, etc.... After our conversation I believe that you understood why the adoption fees are different - they help offset the cost of running the center along with our generous and supportive donors.\n\nI was not physically present during the time you describe an incident occurring.  What I can tell you, however, is that over 1200 dogs and cats have been adopted through Operation Adopt and that we care for our animals so much that we are still one of the very few organizations in Los Angeles that still require a home visit prior to placing an animal in a home because we want to make sure their new home is a safe and fit environment for them.\n\nYour concerns were heard and if there was any corrective action needed, it was addressed.  Thank you for adopting an orphaned animal from Operation Adopt and we hope to hear how things are going over the years you have with your new family member because we like keeping in touch over the animals that we have rescued from shelters and devoted time and love to."}<//Response>

TAPS changed our lives! My husband and I were looking to rescue a dog, but were overwhelmed with the idea of wandering into a shelter. Then we found TAPS. They rescue dogs, they make sure all the dogs and spayed/neutered, chipped, and loved by their volunteers.  We got the sweetest little girl from them and 10 months later we went back and adopted her sister too! We are one big happy family! Thank you TAPS!!!! What a fantastic operation.</Text>

Had the absolute best experience here and couldn't be happier.  My partner and I initially came in to meet a dog we found on Petfinder; when we arrived, that dog was no longer available - however, as soon as another dog became available that Laurie thought would be a good fit for us, she called us -- and it turned out be our DREAM DOG!!  All in all, I don't think we could have adopted a dog had it not been for TAPS; TAPS allowed us the time to make an informed decision that would be right for all of us.  Thanks TAPS, and thanks Laurie!!! :)</Text>

{'time': 1522683940675, 'text': "Jeremy, we are so glad that your daughter found a kitten.  Pets enrich the lives of people and her getting to grow up care for an animal is wonderful.  We are not exactly sure when you came into Operation Adopt since this review was just written (and we haven't had kittens in quite a while), but nonetheless we are hoping that giving you the reason why we don't allow everyone coming in to hold kittens (or puppies) helps you understand.  We don't allow people to hold them without an application on file for a few reasons.  First, everyone coming in would want to hold them and given that we are a pet adoption center with a large number of animals instead of just a pet supply store like the place you mentioned, we give first priority to people with applications on file because going through the process shows us that people are serious about adopting - not just holding animals - which helps our staff and volunteers know where to focus (because it they had to let everyone hold animals, they wouldn't have time to dedicate tho their primary role of caring for the animals).  Secondly, and most importantly, diseases spread by touch, and young animals are extremely vulnerable.  Let's say for instance someone was looking for a puppy or kitten and had been visiting local shelters and holding multiple animals - and one of those animals had a disease.  Diseases in shelters are sometimes fatal and many are contagious not only to other animals, but humans as well.  So, by allowing anyone coming in to touch or hold animals, we are putting our animals and people at risk.  This is another reason we require people to sanitize their hands prior to interacting with our animals.  We are sure the kitten you adopted is healthy and disease free, but hope you understand that we take a lot of precautions to care for our animals and humans coming into contact with them."}< /response>

I took my daughter in to look for a kitten to pair with the other kitten we had adopted a couple of months ago from a store.  They had several kittens in there but they wouldn't allow us to even touch an animal till we filled out an application.  Why spend the time filling out paperwork only to hold an animal that may not like us?  So instead the next day we went to Burbank Pet Plaza where they had a cat adoption.  My daughter found a kitten she loved and we took her home that day.  And the kitten was under $100, neutered, chipped and vaxxed.< /text>

Found the perfect cat to which I wanted to adopt. I’ve been looking for a year or so. I applied and talked with one of their employees about our (my partner’s and I’s) situation of going back to college after the summer. She said that it didn’t sound like a problem to her and that we sounded like very capable parents to a new cat. I called this morning to discuss my application since I never received an email confirmation—their application continually would auto-correct my name, so the email was probably messed up. The person who I talked to on the phone was RUDE. She treated me with no respect and questioned my financial means to care for an animal. (I work while at  school and both my partner’s and I’s family are fairly well off.) We have plenty of time and commitment to an animal and would have provided a safe, loving space for the cat to live for many years to come. I also have raised animals—cattle, horses, swine, chickens, dogs, and cats—since I was in grade school. I was ready to finally find an animal for my own home. For people looking to adopt, PLEASE GO TO ANOTHER SHELTER.< /Text>

We have an offsite adoption coordinator who reviews all of the applications, so we are sorry to hear about your frustration over what seems to be conflicting information.

Operation Adopt is not a shelter so our adoption procedures are different than what you can expect at a municipal shelter.  One part of our process is only adopting to local homes within an approximately 15 mile radius.  Given that you were going back to college out of the area after the summer, our guidelines wouldn’t have been met (and this particular kitten had already been returned once for not being able to settle in a new home).  We wish you the very best of luck in finding another cat because it sounds like you have the means and back up to care for a cat while you are in college.'}</Response>

The people at this place are exceptionally nice and seem to take very good care of the pets. I’m giving  one star because their model doesn’t serve any purpose other than satisfying some pretty troubling elitist attitudes regarding shelters and removing “highly adoptable” dogs from qualified middle and low income adopters. Hear me out.

Based on my visit to their store and information on their website, TAPS selects dogs that have a high probability of adoption, i.e., very cute, young dogs and puppies. I didn’t see a single pit bull though it’s possible they have selected some in the past. After adoption from the shelter, TAPS relocates the animal to a spacious and swanky store located in a very popular and very expensive district in Burbank. Once there, the staff sets the dog up for re-adoption the and adds a hefty premium: we’re taking around $700. For reference, the fee for the same neutered and microchipped dog at the shelter is around $95 or less.

Here’s why this is problematic. Although TAPS claims its methodology “frees up shelter space,” it logically would have a minimal effect in achieving that end, given that the dogs they select are the most likely to be adopted, and fastest adopted at the shelter. Moreover, they are intercepting the animals from potential forever homes just for placement in a self-described halfway house. As a representative from TAPS has admitted in a comment to a previous review, they have even adopted animals who already had potential permanent adopters lined up! These methods perpetuate the problem it claims to be solving. So obviously “freeing up space” or finding forever homes is not their primary goal.

The inflated adoption fee doesn’t seem to add up either. The shelter staff explained to me that the fee covers surgeries, microchipping, food, and lease payments for the Burbank boutique. Assuming the dogs are neutered/spayed and microchipped at the shelter and are eating moderately priced dog food, the vast majority of their adoption fee is going to their lease. The dogs there seemed healthy, and when I asked about the one dog who seemed to
need surgery, the staff insisted that the issue was cosmetic and would not be covered by the adoption fee. Note: my current dog had the same “cosmetic” issue that later caused her recurring injuries and warranted surgery. Providing needed medical care doesn’t seem to be the primary goal either.

So, that leaves us with one other remaining goal of TAPS, which is to provide an alternative for “people who find the shelter experience emotionally upsetting.” Okay so first of all I don’t know a single person who fits that description. With the exception of those with PTSD, this is not an issue for most  people. If you’re unwilling to rescue a dog because you find the shelter experience that unbearable, you probably shouldn’t have a dog no less have a nonprofit dedicated to your “struggle.” Second, if that is your main goal, get a less expensive boutique to house your adoptable animals so you can make the adoption fee accessible to more income levels and place more animals. You can still bring the dogs to popular areas with lots of foot traffic. The shelters do it all the time.

Finally, the most irksome issue with this place is how class (and race if you want to get deeper) are implicated in its mission. The organization, located in an affluent, mostly white part of LA, skims the shelters, located in the lower-income areas to take the best dogs away from low and middle income community members and potential forever homes so that they can be placed in a temporary shelter and adopted at an inaccessible fee by those with much greater means. Coupled with their aversion to the shelter experience, which perhaps requires a trek into a “dirtier” and less white area, it’s hard to not feel the subtle undertones of classism (and perhaps racism).

In short, don’t feel good about yourself if you adopt here.</text>

<response>{'time': 1522461801250, 'text': 'Katelyn, it may help you to have background on how Operation Adopt came into existence.  For years, The Animal Protectorates worked on "puppy mill" legislation to stop pet stores in Burbank, California from selling animals coming from commercial breeding facilities.  The alternative business model is to help rehome animals coming from shelters, humane societies or qualified rescue organizations in the same space.  Consumers visiting pet stores selling the commercially bred animals were spending thousands of dollars on purebred animals, having no idea where they were coming from.  We are really excited that these same consumers are finding joy in adopting orphaned animals coming from shelters.  Their mindsets are changing from thinking shelter animals are inferior to making a shelter animal a part of their family.  You are correct that adoption fees at Operation Adopt are higher than they are at a shelter.  This is because there are no subsidies from local agencies to offset the rent, staff salaries (we have to have staff to care for the animals), workers comp insurance, utilities, vet bills, and everything else that comes along with running a pet adoption center.  The perceived value of shelter animals are increasing in peoples minds (and hearts) because we are bringing them into a clean environment where meeting them is easy and supportive.  We also conduct home visits on every adoption to try to insure that these animals lives are headed in a better direction than where they came from (most of the animals we receive are neglected, some matted to the point of not being able to walk comfortably and many have medical issues requiring immediate and continuing vet care to get them to the point they are ready for adoption).  Sometimes though, even our rigorously vetted adopters have circumstances change in their lives that prevent them from keeping their pet.  Our guarantee is that in those circumstances we will receive their animal back and once again try to rehome the animal so that the animal will never enter the shelter again (our Purple Collar Promise to the animal).  So, our mission to that end has a positive impact on reducing the strain on shelters.\nWe hope knowing some more background will give you a different perception.  Thank you for visiting and for your compliment about the staff (we think they are pretty awesome too) and the good care we give the animals while they are with us.  We don\'t take your review as negative, on the contrary, we think all reviews are positive because they help us grow as the most unique adoption center in the country.'}</response>< Gmap_id>

A few months ago I was on the hunt to find a companion. After searching high and low I found the cutest dog on PetFinder from this rescue and decided to send an email to get more information. I wanted to do the four day foster but Shelley (the owner) denied that. I moved forward and adopted my blind dog Moira however, I had to sign the contract before I ever got to see the records. After having my dog for a day I started noticing that she was panting a lot and sometimes even shaking and this was when we would just be laying on the couch. After finally receiving the records I was livid! The record showed that my dog was ten almost eleven years old BUT online they had her as a five year old puppy! I completely understand that rescues never know an exact age but come on! Cutting down half of an animals age is completely unacceptable! I decided to try not to let that get to me as she was such a sweet animal so I kept her for awhile. The first weekend that I had her I tried to go on a walk and after a short ten minutes she was coughing and breathing so hard that I had to rush her in the house. I was afraid she had sniffed something bad but once she got in and was able to lay down she was fine. So the next day I took her on the same walk and the same thing happened after ten minutes. That is when I realized she was too old and unfortunately I would need to give her back. I sent Shelley an email and she called me one morning and I can honestly tell you Shelley is the most UNPROFESSIONAL person to run a business that I have ran into so far. She was so rude and was cutting me off as I was trying to explain myself and talked to me like I was a child. She then yelled and told me I could bring the dog back and get my money back. The next weekend I took the dog back and Shelley refused to give me my money back stating she had a signed contract which she is right she does however, she LIED about the age of the dog and also had me sign the contract before she sent me the records! Such SHADY business. I decided not to cause a scene at her store so I went home and sent her a very serious email. After going back and forth with me she eventually told me she would discuss this in her next board meeting on Oct 11th and get back to me but the next day I received a call from a lady, Laurie, claiming to be a part of the board but I have yet to find proof of that and she advised they would give me half of my money back IF I signed a nondisclosure agreement. Again SHADY!!! I had them send me the nondisclosure and after review it was completely ridiculous. It states their side with the contract attached but does not state that they LIED about the age. I let Laurie know I would only sign this IF I could add in my part and attach the records but of course they denied that. Shelley stated that they have some vets who stated the dog was eight and another six however they have NO proof that she is five and not to mention the vet records that show she was ten is the shelter that the owner surrendered her too and it has an exact date of birth! I am posting this and will continue to post and warn people and report my experience to the BBB so NO one makes the same mistake I did. Do Not let your excitement get the best of you or trust them because their store is clean or that they do home check ins. Do ALL research and ask for the records BEFORE signing anything. Shelley is an attorney and knows ways around how to scheme and manipulate. OH and not to mention Moira is posted back on PetFinder as five years old which is completely false due to the fact that she will be eleven in two months on December 30th as she was born in 2005. This situation for me was SHADY and a complete FRAUD and Shelley should be ashamed that she lied and then had the nerve to make it seem like I was the issue.
*In response to Shelley's comment, the eye care receipt I received showed they paid $234 for eye care. I kept Moira for a total of 3 weeks. Also, the prescription is NOT the issue, her LYING is! Be careful when adopting here!*< /review>

{'time': 1476816237960, 'text': "We do our best to provide all of the information we have about an animal.  We were informed by the shelter that Moira originally came in as a stray, then was adopted and returned by the person just adopting her(reflected as OWNER SUR RETURN) on her shelter records.   The shelter estimated her age as being born in 2005, likely because they thought her blindness was due to age (but after spending nearly $1000 at an eye specialist to try to have sight restored in at least one eye, we learned this was likely a condition since birth).  Our age estimate was taken from several vets who saw her as well as our assessment of her activity level - all of which we shared with you.  It is impossible to know a shelter animals exact date of birth.  We do the best we can.\n\nPrior to your adopting Moira, we gave you the veterinarians information who had been treating her for bladder leakage and urged you to contact them.  We told you she needed to be on medication for life and gave you the price estimate for it - the foster also provided you with a month's supply.  After having Moira in your home for a few days, you decided she was not the right dog for you.  We offered you a credit of the adoption fee towards another dog which you refused.\n\nThere are many other inaccuracies in your review and I fear that trying to address them all here will lead to more comments from you - none of which are productive to what we do - try to save animals from the shelters - which since opening just over a year ago we have done just that with nearly 450 happy families.\n\nOn a really great note, we would like to let you know that Moira was adopted into a lovely home where they think she is terrific.  We hope you find the perfect furry family member to enrich your life and bring you happiness."}</Response>

<review>I couldn't find anywhere to help me, then these guys told me to come down and if it was something easy they'd do it right then & there. They got me right in showed me the issue. They were out of the part I needed, so they didn't even charge me for their time. Absolutely suburb customer service. I will definitely be back next time I need my bike serviced.<//review>< Pics>

The best bike shop for high-end mountain bike service in the East Bay. Top notch mechanics, fast but always spot-on service, and super friendly community-focused shop culture. The only place I take my mountain bikes for service, period. Have had them service my Yeti and Santa Cruz mountain bikes and have never experienced anything but exceptional service.<//Text>

They were able to squeeze my repair in when other shops were weeks backlogged. They diagnosed my problem, quoted me a very fair price to fix it, and then fixed a couple more minor issues as part of the same repair at no extra cost!

I will definitely be heading back when I need more work done.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Frame Up fixed my bike in a quickness. At a different shop in Davis, I recently got it tuned up and they changed a few parts on it. When I received it from the other shop in Davis, my 1st and 8th gear were not working. I took my bike to Frame Up and within 5 minutes the mechanic notices the other shop installed the wrong derailleur, which is causing my gears to not operate properly. Frame up ordered the part and has my bike working like brand new. I WILL ALWAYS MAKE THE 1 HOUR DRIVE TO FRAME UP FOR THEM TO WORK ON MY BIKE FROM NOW ON!!< /Review>< gmap_id>

Got turned away at two other shops that were either too busy or told me they couldn't do it. Not only did FUB say yes they also had the parts I needed in stock.

Chris was the one who helped me out, he had a lot of knowledge and expertise. I also appreciate the fact that they are open during the SIP.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Awesome shop with lots of great bikes, gear and knowledge!

I was in the Walnut Creek area to see family and I was able to stop in, rent a bike (an awesome Orbea Terra) and chat with the great owners and staff.

I got a lot of great info on local trails, routes and conditions.

They were great about putting my pedals and saddle on the bike and getting it set up how I wanted it for my ride.

I love that they offer all stock bikes as a demo!

I can’t recommend Frame Up Bikes enough!</review>

Frame Up Bikes will be my go to everything bikes. Chris is so smart, competent and knowledgeable in everything bike. He set my 1/11 in a way I can ride/climb anything let alone camping miles on end. I'll continue to come to Chris and gang at FUB, for my bike needs. Thanks brother!!!!<//text>

I was referred to Frame Up Bikes by Brian Kennedy #BKXC and glad I took the advice! I've been to many shops that quickly made me feel put off because I'm not one of the cool guys that know enough about bikes. Chris was super friendly and is obviously very knowledgeable. Frame Up has a great vibe that made me feel like I was in exactly the right place. The store appears well stocked at competitive prices. Best bike shop I've been to in the entire area, highly recommended!<//Text>

<review>What I love about this bike shop is how knowledgeable they are about not only the bikes they sell, but repair as well. Now, granted repairing a bicycle isn't like open heat surgery, but I've been to a number of places where bike techs don't adjust my bike so it rides better than when I brought it in. If you're looking for bargains, none will be found here. But if you are in the market for high-end bikes (both road and dirt), this place is very good and the staff is super cool.</review>< date>

< Review>
I have a Cervelo R5 that I build from scratch myself.  Once the job was done, I tried to adjust the special wedge system seat clamp but soon realized that it is stuck and it's not going to move.  I took the bike to a very famous bike shop in East Bay to look at it.  After leaving the bike there for a week, they claimed that they worked on it for an entire day and yet no luck.  They also said they called Cervelo and followed their instruction and came to the conclusion that the bike must be shipped back to Cervelo and if determined that it is still under warranty I will get a new frame.  I decided before doing anything else, I have another bike shop take a look and that's when I found Frame Up on google map.  Amazingly enough in less than 15 minutes they manged to pull the wedge clamp out without any damage to the carbon frame.  They also clean the seat post.  I was happiest man on earth at that moment.  They also didn't want to charge me but I felt obligated to pay something.  This is the most professional bike shop in the area hands down.  I will not bother going anywhere else.<//Review>

After 2 weeks;  I still have 4 nails on.  2 guys and they take their time, which u notice when your nails do not fall off.  They guy who did my nails did not cut any of my fingers which I thought was weird every time I got my nails done before...I was cut with the sandpaper, etc.  This is 2weeks after will get a full set to change color and will tell you how it went. 😉</review>

They did a really nice job on my 82 year old mom's feet.. She is diabetic. So I was kind of scared for her to get them done. I let them know. They were very careful with her. Did not hurt her at all. She felt very spoiled. Her toes looked very nice 😊. She said she would love to go there again.</Review>

Very nice gentleman did my pedicure and fixed 2 of my acrylic nails. He really did awesome on my pedicure!! Now days it's hard to find a pedicure place where they really give you your money's worth with the callus remover but he sure did! Very attentive to detail and wasn't in a rush. There was nice relaxing music playing and the place was very clean.< /Text>

Walk in only, so my friend and I waited about an hour at peak time on a Friday evening. I got the spa pedicure and it was sooo nice. It included a soak, an exfoliating scrub and cooling lotion, a wonderful massage and they werent shy with the pumice hahaha. The nail tech was very attentive, gentle and kind. Would definitely reccomend and come again!! :) the nail techs took their time and seemed to care a lot about quality.< /Review></record>

<Date>1569202678325</Date><username>Christy I.</username><text>1st time here. After looking at the reviews I wasn't sure I should come, but then looked closely and realized some people don't give fair reviews (ie. 1 star for not being open has nothing to do with the quality of the manicure/pedicure). Yes some reviews may be valid but not for the service I was looking for (and most of those negative reviews were over a year old). I wanted a spa pedicure with sanitized tools. My friend said this place was recently good and since it was the only place open on a Sunday, thot I'd give it a try.😉 Glad I did! ⭐ There were only 2 guys working and it was nice to not have the usual women workers constantly gossiping in a foreign language making you feel like they are taking about you. 😞
I was very happy with the spa pedicure and at $16 thot it was fairly priced. And no push on upselling. I won't hesitate coming back. 😀< /text><gmap_id>0x80dcb4047f199e01:0xe8523eb2932bb546</gmap_id><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHS_f5LhTx9D1qCRIauuoIPPpjdAybOjnvzCe5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Horrible service. Asked for a simple gel polish change. Man left each coat thick, bubbly, and sticky.
I asked for him to remove it & he said now I would have to wait till he attended the other lady's pedicure. Will not go back! Very unprofessional and spot is dirty & worn down. Prices are the same everywhere else. Recommend anywhere else.<//Review>

Been going here for years and always a pleasant visit, great prices. I only get pedicures no manicures or nails. The ladies are great and friendly. I've never had an infection or anything weird there. I used to get waxed there, and never a bad experience. My normal nail place is in LBC so I'm happy to have a local place in JV to go to. Ample parking too! 👌</text>

This place is disgusting. The 89 pound girl that did my pedicure was so rude didn't even acknowledged me.  She was ruff and barely scrubbed my feet.  I told her THREE times to cut my nails short and she didn't do so,  it was like she wanted to do what she wanted to do.  I ended up telling her NOT to polish my nails, just leave them alone.  She got upset and threw her tools down!!  NEVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE!! She's lucky I didn't kick her!  Not even worth one star.< /text>

I've been coming here for about a year, and May, Lily, and Linda are all absolutely wonderful! I make sure to call ahead so that I don't have to wait, or accidentally come during their peak times. I'm very happy about the slight price drop on the gel nails, thanks to the new owner! I always leave feeling relaxed and beautiful! Thank you for the excellent service :)< /review>

I went in clearly for a manicure and pedicure, told the women that my large toe hurt on my right foot.... she chose to pick at my left toe instead. Hurt me so much and I let her know. She explained oh it's because the last person didn't take out the whole ingrown nail. Little did she know I had went to them the last time also.... I never had a problem with them until now. I was so displeased and felt horrible because she was being loud and saying it was my fault I couldn't take her picking at my poor nail that I left and didn't want to just leave without paying she charged me full price and told me to come back tomorrow to let the usual girl do my door. Seriously are you kidding? I'm so upset being pregnant and just trying to have a relaxing day before I work tomorrow turned out to be horrible. I feel horrible o even paid them but I wasn't trying to get services free just wanted my services done😐😔😕
Good luck to whomever goes here.< /text>< Rate>

I was hestitant to try this place with the bad reviews, but with so many closed on Sundays I had few other options. I was very happy with the service. Henry did such a great job, asked how I liked my nails shaped, how dark I wanted the polish, took the time to actually trim my cuticles and no annoying upselling. I will be returning for future service! BTW I have Gel nails and the price was the same as 2 other salons I had tried in the past.
Oh, if anyone is looking for a mommy and me pedicure, I saw a really cute cat themed pedi spa chair sized for kids!<//review>

<Review>worst nail salon I have ever been to if I could give no stars i would this place should be shut down she literally glued one of the acrylics crooked so I had to ask her to remove it and she was extremely rude about it so I didn’t even want to bother with any of the other ones I did not ask for gel and neither did my sister but she still did it and charged me 35 for mine and 30 for my sisters after complaining about it. The original price for my ugly ass nails we’re going to be 40 and my sisters 35 but when I walked in asking another girl how much it would be for short nails for my sister she said 20 and when I brought that up she denied ever saying that and she yelled when talking to me I was about to square up lmaooo don’t even think about spending a penny here girl don’t even waste your time walking in</Review><UserId.>100037496700527377498</UserId.>< Name>

<text>A blind person could have done a better job, worse pedicure I’ve ever had. It was rushed and rough. The paint is on my skin. She never even filed my nails or shaped them and she used a drill to buff my nails. This place needs to close</text>< pics>

Thr WORST place! Went in for 2 pedicure's, and I really wanted to walk out. My feet were only soaked in water, barely removed my old nail-polished, did not clean my feet and re-polished. They really need to go out of business.< /text>

I waited 45 min to be helped, and the gel manicure took 2 hours to complete. Mind you, this was in the middle of the week with 1 person waiting other that me, and 3 employees. The manicurist spent a whole hour trimming my cuticle and surrounding area and made me bleed a few times. By the end of my manicure I had swollen fingers from all the excessive trimming. Even after she finished the manicure she STILL went back to trim some more! I also had air bubbles all over my manicure. At that point I was soooo damn irritated that I will never go back again.

Like many others, I wanted to support small businesses in my community, which is why I waited as long as I did to be helped, but I will definitely take my business elsewhere. I wouldn't want to risk a fungal infection just to stay local.< /text>

First OFF my husband almost lost his toe, due to using dirty equipment,  I sat after this and watched them use the same tools on 3 different people without washing or sanitizing. I was disgusted. We are currently seeking justice for my husband and they can not provide any insurance information.  PLEASE READ AND TAKE CAUTION. It could cost you a lot more then a toe. Also the customer service is awful, I don't even know if they know what customer service is. They also have another location which I have not been too, however I would still be cautious.</text></record>

Took way too long for a full set. I was there for 2 hours! (Not including wait time to get started) Walked away with a lumpy top coat even though I pointed it out 3 times, and my thumb nail is completely crooked. By the far the worst experience I've ever had at a nail salon. I will not be returning.

Oh and they don't even know their own prices. They overcharge you compared to the posted prices. So watch out!</Text>

<Review>Came in to get my nails done, the old guy with the glasses made me bleed on 3 fingers, kept yanking my hand, and bending my fingers really hard. He was using what looked like an already used file. So gross especially since he made me bleed and kept going! Who knows how many other people's blood was on there?! . I walked out mid nails.

<Name>Pattii Gutierrez< /Name><date>1538759831612</date><Rating>1</Rating><text>Why isnt there a 0 stars option?? I came to this nail salon to get a full set for myself and also for my daughter. Lisa was the one who helped me,  my daughter, got a guy's who's name I didn't get. Lisa hurt(felt like it was burning) my nails multiple times and also cut the side of my finger, wasn't even with the nail drill, it was with the nail file!! One of my nails was very crooked looked like if my finger was deformed.  Had to ask her twice before she,  in a bad mood had to put my finger in some liquid to take the nail off(this was before acrylic)  My daughter was also cut by the guy and the nail polish was messy. I had never been to a place that did such a horrible job and were so rude to their customers. I'm not the type to make a big scene, but I know I had many reasons to. Anyways,  I paid, left and will NEVER be going back to that place. Oh almost forgot, thinking back, I don't know why, dumb me didn't say anything, but the drill bits were not in the disinfectant liquid and had powder on them like if they had already been used. Both our nails started getting itchy as we walked to my car. Thank God nothing happened and they did so bad that 5 days later all of my nails are off. Im seriously not exxagerating this place sucks.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dcb4047f199e01:0xe8523eb2932bb546</gmap_id></record>

<Text>This place sucks!!! The worst nail spa I ever been to. Some lady named Lisa that works there mest up my nails to the point where $27 was not even worth it. I asked to speak to her boss and she said he was on "vacation". And on top of that she was being rude so I just ended up paying her but definitely won't be coming back! If your boss comes back from "vacation" I hope your reading this, hint of advice, you should probably hire people with experience that get the job well done if u want to continue your business. Otherwise you should probably close down!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

We have gone to this salon many times and the service was always good, until this week. I asked for gel nails and the man that waited on me,  did not do a great job. He used way too many chemicals on my toes and rubbed my one heel rough and also two of my toes. It tool forever to complete the job. We will nolonger go there. Very disappointed this time. My feet are sore and you know how you feel when your feet hurt. Thanks for listening, Marlies<//text>

This place is dirty and the  equipment is outdated and delabidated.  Looks like it is going out of business and it should.  They have so few customers they  call people when customers arrive and then make sure they service their regular customers who arrive after you while you wait. Told me a 10 minutes, more like 20. Will never go back</text>

The worse nail job ever!!! I wanted to try a place closer to home, I figured I would give my business to my community the worse mistake of my life the gentleman that did my nails took about 1 1/2 hours on my full set that ended looking like duck feet. I had red nail polish everywhere except on my nails messy sloppy nails. I rather drive 1 hour to my original nail place< /Review>

<text>Don’t bother ordering the Papaya Milk Smoothie on doordash here, that flavor is never available and even when it says in your order “Call me if not available” they won’t and won’t send nothing at all. I ordered two smoothies and they only sent one. I don’t understand why they couldn’t call so I can get another flavor. Had to call support for a refund which will take days to arrive. Thanks for wasting my time.

Update: 1 star to 3 since the owner at least addressed/followed up on issue.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiKEHRjWQu8u3F_wAjHs48jlzAE-E0Kw-3bCnM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1603930709229, 'text': 'Sorry about your order.

<Text>The man who owns this place is the best, and we must protect him at all costs.

Both the Taiwan style milk tea and curly fries are enough to bring anyone to their knees out of pure joy, and I would have it 3 times a day if it didn’t mean a triple bypass operation in the near future.

This is a must visit establishment!<//Text>< Pics>

I loooove this place!! They are literally my favorite boba place ever. Not to mention, they have a reputation for having the best popcorn chicken in Berkeley and they definitely do! Just wish they had the nutrition facts on their website, it would be nice to know how many calories I'm eating lol.< /text>

<text>Love the Sweetheart Cafe in SF but the Berkeley version doesn't hold to the same standard. Decent food and drinks but more expensive than neighboring Boba shops that, in my opinion, are better. When I visited, the staff wasn't friendly either whereas the nearest Boba shop is always super friendly. Decent but there's better Boba nearby.<//text>< pictures>

Every time I come here, I devour a cheeseburger. Surprising that a boba shop makes good burgers!

I also get the black milk tea. Can’t get enough of it.<//text>

I have been coming here throughout my whole time at Berkeley. Despite all the other boba shops opening, this is one of the most friendly and comfy boba shops. Plus! They also play Pokemon Go and give discounts for players.<//Review>

<text>Very friendly service, made my order special, highly affordable.
Sure, the actual space is small and low budget, but try beating that price or finding half as many options at most places, or getting such service without a bunch of add-on fees -- especially on thanksgiving evening.</text><Name>Sunnifa Navrátil (Synnøve)< /Name>< UserId.>

Sweetheart Cafe is one of the best value Boba places that you'll find in Berkeley. They've got a pretty diverse selections of teas/ milk teas that you can order, but more than likely you'll find that you'll end up with a favorite that you order every time. For me that was the Tapioca Pearl Milk Tea, but I've had friends who prefer other selections as well.

Sweetheart also offers various snacks, I'd definitely recommend the popcorn chicken, as you get a good amount of chicken and adding a bit of chilli powder to it really takes it to the next level. Sweetheart is definitely worth a try at this price point, even if it's not your favorite, it can easily become a staple in your Berkeley Boba world.<//Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Highly recommend this place. One of the best boba places in Bay Area. Their menu is not distinctive or unique from other boba places. What is distinctive about this place is that their boba drinks have sweet and chewy tapioca pearls you can't find anywhere else. That is what makes their boba drinks unique and delicious. Also, they don't make their drinks too sweet or too bland; it's just right. As for the place itself, it has become somewhat run-down, so you don't come here for the ambiance. You come here for the boba and take a walk around Cal.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>If I could give this store a -10 stars I would! Very rude customer service. I went in yesterday to just get one simple question answered and the girl in there was totally rude! The young man in there was busy with a customer doing his job the woman in there just stood behind the counter twiddling her thumbs and yelling orders a customers!!! I've been with Verizon for over 10 years and this makes me want to go to AT&T!!! She's needs to be fired! Period! Worst place EVER!!! I am seriously thinking of changing phone carriers due to this interaction!!!< /Text><userid>106801289360057559732</userid>< resp>

Even though I gave our sales person Lizzie and great review at first as she seem to be knowledgeable and honest with the sales position!!!!!
But then she turned my off my original phone I was trading in and told me I’d have to be without my phone for 1 day and that my new phone will arrive the next dat by about noon! Needless did it not only NOT arrive in 1 day but it did not arrive the next day either!! And when I called to inquire about the delay I was informed that they in fact have no answers for me nor do they know when it would arrive!!
Lizzie was well aware that we do not live here and was passing through on our way to Oregon when our truck broke down and we will only be in town for a couple days waiting for our truck to be fixed!!! She was also well aware that we were dropping our truck off on Friday for repairs and thereafter will have NO access to Transportation! We were assured that we would have our new phone business taken care of by then and not to worry!
Needless to say none of that has happened and we have gotten NO answers to how to fix this issue!!!!
In fact when we inquired when I will receive my new phone I was told they have NO idea they had no tracking number to track it 🙄 and they are unable to turn my old phone back on so I would at least have use of that meanwhile🤬
I called Verizon and was told that they should have NEVER TURNED OFF MY OLD PHONE UNTIL THE RECEIVED THE NEW UPGRADED PHONE IN THE 1st place!!!!!!
Beyond inconvenient & frustrated at this point!!!

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACEs<//Review>

While helping me he also gave help to those he could in an effective and well mannered way.  Dude deserves a promotion and he owes his boss a monster energy drink red.

Terrible service, never have any accessories in stock and carry the worst quality accessories that cost an outrageous price. I spent 70 dollars on a screen protector and it was terrible from the start. Got dirt underneath the screen, was super thick so it made the tough sensitivity on my phone much harder. After it broke a few wakes after having it, I went in to get a "free" replacement and Victra did not even have them in stock anymore. Horrible experience, will never go back and plan to drop Verizon after my plan expires.< /Text>

HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! Promised my phone would only be off for 1 day! It’s been 3 and when inquired how much longer for my new upgraded phone to arrive I was told they do NOT know even though we were promised 1 day 🤬
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!! And especially sales gal LIZZY!!!!
We were told buy Verizon that they should not have ever turned my phone off until I received my new upgraded new phone 🙄< /Text>

<Review>I went into the store just intending to look, but because of Coleen  I left with a new phone, and tablet  and a great new smile! She was so helpful in assisting me and she was right there to greet me!!!! She was so great at explaining everything and was very confident in her work! Defiantly will be doing busy with them more often because of Coleen!<//Review>< username>

I was having some issues with my new LG G8 Thinq, and Luis patiently helped me reaolve it. This is not my first time working with Luis who has great patience and isnthe reason I am still a Verizon customer. Go pay a visit and see the difference great customer service makes. Luis especially seems to always look for ways to save you money. So do what I did... Pay this Verizon Victra a visit. Stop in and say hello to Luis, and tell then AT&T sent you.<//Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>What a GREAT experience! I had to switch from a 3G flip phone (yes, old school) to a 4G flip phone.  After going to a Reno Verizon location, where was given a 4g SIM card installed in a 3G phone, I left with a phone that didn't work! I drove 90 minutes to Susanville and Perla and Brandon not only hooked me up with a new FLIP phone but transferred my contacts and photos and gave me a plan that saved me money! They went above and beyond my expectations and were so patient. I am so happy that I came here, THANK YOU!!!! BEST SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>The manager called me when my niece decided to get a new Verizon cell phone.  I wanted to order the phone online, like I usually do... but the manager insisted it would be the same as if I ordered it online, the only difference would be that my niece would get her cell phone that day.  She called me a few times, kept asking me for my Verizon pin number to add the line to my current Verizon account.  Several months later my niece switched her phone to Sprint, I kept my Verizon account (I've had for over a decade).  6 months later, without prior notification or warning I get a notification from a collections agency for almost $570.00.  I've always paid my bill early or on time and have maintained an excellent status.  I spent over an hour on the phone with Verizon, when they finally figured out it was the Susanville 4G store that had done it and wanted me to pay additional fees for the cell phone itself on top of the $350.00 early termination fee I have already paid.  They never sent me a bill, never called me, zero notification until yesterday from the collection agency.  I am not very happy with this and want people to be forewarned about this store, they can be very pushy and tell you everything will be the same...it's not.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, GET YOUR PHONE FROM VERIZON ONLINE, DO NOT USE THE "4G Wireless" STORE!!<//Review>< Pictures>

Life savers! I left my phone at a rest stop west of Reno and these guys gave me a loaner so I could be sure to get home over Hwy 44 through pretty bad snow. That's what I call a total solution. That was over a year ago and those the event still sticks with me. Thanks again you guys!</review>

<Review>Here's how I had my experience with Verizon I had to drive into Susanville to renew my license and to get the real ID. After I completed my task at DMV I noticed next door to DMV a Verizon store. I decided to go in because I was having some problems with my phone.
There was a couple of customers ahead of me but it didn't take long before I was up there asking questions about my phone how I can resolve my problem. The representative was a young man and greeted me with a smile. I was somewhat concerned that he wouldn't have enough experience to help me out. Of course you know the old saying (Don't judge a book by its cover) he was extremely knowledgeable and help me through the problem I was having. I definitely was impressed I was in and out within about 15 minutes and guess what he didn't charge me one red Cent. Even after he took the time to solve my concerns what else could you ask. So I guess the simplest way to say it I would definitely recommend the Verizon store next to DMV in Susanville. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. 👍😎<//Review><gmapID>0x809d9633c6e8ce7d:0xd248e35059e93c5c<//gmapID><username>Larry Howerton</username>< date>

Holly Van Steyn was a fantastic help at the Susanville, California Outlet.  She was able to troubleshoot the problem with my phone and got me hooked up with the phone cord I needed. Thanks Holly.  I hope to make it back to Susanville to photograph the murals around town.  Once again thank you and great job.< /review>

Super clean and friendly. New washers and free drying. Can't beat that. I like that you can use the Pay Range app. Basically, you pay using your debit. Love it since  those laundry cards and/or change/money seem to mysteriously vanish from me. 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️<//Review>

<Review>We switched our laundry place to this one and we love it. The owner are very nice and greets you and also helps us take our clothes to the car when we can’t carry it all. The employees are also very nice and always ask if we need help. The laundromat is very clean and spacious so we can fold our clothes.<//Review><username>Natalia Perez< /username>< Resp>

Best Laundromat I've been to! It's always so clean! Especially during Covid, I felt iffy about going out to such public places, but the service here is AMAZING! As soon as I got here I had a very well mannered Asian man employee (or owner)  offered to help me with my cart, sanitized my cart and let me know there was more parking spaces towards the back. Outstanding service by this specific employee! Will be coming here from now and on.< /Text>

<Text>Just what Altadena needed! Convenient neighborhood spot where you can grab coffee among other drinks and quick bites for breakfast and lunch. The service is consistently friendly and welcoming, which has contributed to this place becoming a regular meeting place for some locals. I will be back! Oh yeah, the wifi is great too.😊</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c2e411390653:0xa9e0d7966220af4b< /Gmap_id>< Date>

< review>
This place reminds me of all the local coffee shops you’d find in and around Portland, OR before it became too hip for its own good. Coffee and food are great. People are great. There’s so much natural comfort in the dining area and there’s a great area for the kids, too. This place is a staple and is the natural essence of Altadena/Pasadena.<//review>

The yogurt parfait is refreshing, iced coffee is tasty, and the portions are extremely generous -- especially for the prices. (A hipster place over by Lincoln St. wanted $6 for a parfait, and I waited in line for 10 minutes. The line never moved, so I bailed and came here. So glad I did.) Great people and quality. I will definitely return.</Review>< pictures>

A nice out of the way coffee house.  It is nondescript with friendly servers and good food/coffee.  Their hours are from 7:30am - 4:30pm daily.

I wish they were open later.< /Text>

This place is great. Great atmosphere to relax, read, play board games, suit and drink your coffee! The music is great. It's a great mix of genres andjust loud enough to hear it but not be distracting. Drinks are delicious also! Definitely going to be one of my regular spots!<//text>

My favorite coffee shop. I try to go at least once a week. The owners are very friendly and their coffee and shakes are amazing. My favorite is the matcha green tea with banana shake.</Text>

<text>The coffee is amazing!! So glad I found this gem. I just started a new job around the corner and it is much closer than the local Starbucks and has 10x better coffee. Will definitely be frequenting this place on a regular basis.</text><date>1409173389814< /date><name>Nicole Collins< /name>< Rating>

I love this spot! It is perfectly nestled and truly an escape when you want good coffee and snacks and a peaceful atmosphere. Wi-Fi accessible.  Books and board games availabke for your entertainment. Food served as well (pastries, finger foods" acai bowls, oatmeal, etc).<//Text>

Sidewalk Cafe is awesome. Brian and his aunt, the new owners are laid back and easy-going.

Sidewalk Cafe is a throwback to old fashion cafe's. It's very relaxing and inviting.

My first time here, this afternoon, and Brian recommended the chai tea. The chai tea is way better then the place that has locations on every street corner. The brown maple crunch oatmeal is on-point. The taste and quantity great. The price is reasonable. Parking easy since it's in a small shopping center.

I'm going to recommend Sidewalk Cafe to RBAC water fitness classes.</Text>

Definitely a great locals spot. We are new to the neighborhood, but Sidewalk Cafe is already somewhere we are excited to frequent. Nothing fancy, but it's cozy and chill and so far so good on the cappuccino and wifi.</Review>

Freshest coffee in the city.  I love the atmosphere there and the employees are all so kind and caring.  The internet connection is fast and the big T.V. they have makes me feel right at home when I just want to sit on one of the comfy chairs and relax.< /review>

<review>Ok, this is a rather unusual review, but here goes:  I know that the coffee at this joint is good, but how good is it?  I was at grave risk of becoming an espresso widow to the Sidewalk Cafe!  My wife loves the espresso here so much that the coffee I made at home could not compete.  It was getting to be that just about every morning, I would wake up to an empty bed.  Yes, she would get up before me and jet up to the Sidewalk Cafe, and STAY THERE until she had had a couple of espressos.  And she'd bring her lap top too, so I know the wifi is great as well, because she would spend hours there getting all her work done!

Finally, I couldn't take this place showing me up.  I broke down and got a quality espresso maker and coffee grinder off Amazon (to the tune of $500!) to woo her back home, and it worked like a charm!  (Whew, lucky for me!  It would have been a bummer if that didn't work!  I'd have to do some serious soul searching...)

So if you find your significant other missing when you wake up in the morning, DON"T PANIC!  And don't take it personally, it is probably just the coffee.  Check the Sidewalk Cafe before you call the police or hospitals, and definitely before accusing him/her of two timing you!

We still drop by to visit for coffee with friends now and then though.  And just in case you aren't ready to spring for $500 worth of espresso gear, this is definitely the place!< /review><Response>None< /Response>< user_id>

< Review>
I only wish fast food restaurants would have two lines; one for those ordering a lot of food items and those of us who just want a drink, as the wait can be long. Also it would be nice if there was coverage where you order for when the sun's directly in your face or when it rains so you and your car stay dry. Good customer service at this Del Taco, great job !< /Review>

Had an unfortunately lackluster experience at this Del Taco location.

First off, access to getting inside is more difficult than you’d imagine a restaurant would want it to be—the location has two entrances, the easier of which does not have a door handle on the outside. It also can not be “pushed” inward. I watched several patrons use their fingers to dig into the crevice where the door meets the wall to pull the door open. Nonsense.

The staff at the register were okay, but the experience felt more like a hindrance than a welcoming experience. Seating was vast and varied (see pics).

The food. WOOF. My chicken taco had all the cheese on one end of the taco, and all the lettuce on the other. Furthermore, all the SAUCE on the inside was off to one side of the taco as well. You could tell the staff was hurried (not sure why, you can see in the pics there was no one there yet), because my Beyond Burrito was also torn at one end.

I still gave 3 stars because a) Del Taco is the best, and b) this is a fast food restaurant, not a Michelin location. STILL, I would hesitate to come back here so quickly.<//review>

I was super hungry and went into the drive-thru ordered 2 soft chicken tacos add green sauce and a medium Diet Coke.  The soft chicken tacos were delicious. The tacos were filled nicely with enough chicken and cheese and not overfilled with lettuce lol the added extra green sauce was another layer of flavor that I like in addition to the special sauce it had. The diet coke was perfect and not flat👍
The only negative was no receipt for my purchase with my credit card🙄which I like to check afterwards against my bank card debits.
1. + Friendly cashier
2. + Good food and drink
3. + Super fast
4. -  No receipt

Overall a very good destination for a quick bite to eat!😉👍<//text>

I think it's all about the  Attitude on the person who is helping you or taking your order. In all it's a pretty good place to eat.< /Review>

The tacos look sad and I ordered large fries and I got the small serving in a large box. There’s a better Del Taco right across the street on Tustin. Go to that one people, a million times better and better service as well.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxjG4EG8RlPnP2On3j_ZAL-6ycWYJnWePKtjk5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoizX4ENMZMi7y7O6CbPgvu7dQ3nTlueEgfBs6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dcd7294808edcb:0x96e59ef432fba30c</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I had a good review but I'm changing my review.  All I ordered was fries,. That's it.  So I expect fresh, hot fries,,,,NOT,,,,
The fries were cold,,,not fresh tasting,,,,and terrible....If they can't give me a simple thing like hot, fresh fries,,,I can't trust this place.  Very small amount also, and I wasted money.<//Review>

<Review>Visited this location on July 7th.  Not only did they totally screw up our order by giving us the wrong items, take a look at the sign in the lobby (picture attached). It says their items were picked fresh almost 4 MONTHS AGO! Can't even bother updating their sign, I guess making food correctly is even more difficult.</Review><username>J M Atchley</username>< Time>

I have always been a fan of Del Taco, and of this location in particular. They are a fairly busy store and they keep the line moving well. Everything at this location seems fresh made to me every time I go. Other places I get my food as soon as I pull up to the window and something isn't fresh. You can usually tell with the tortilla starting to firm up instead of being warm and soft. Never had that issue at this store. Staff is courteous and always makes sure to check if you need any sauce.<//Text>

Del taco is very convenient to where I live. It tends to be the place I frequent and most often. It is good food at a decent price and it is open 24 hours. At least the drive-thru is open 24 hours.< /Review>

<review>This is one of my favorite Del Taco locations. The food is always hot and freshly made to order with most of thier employees being friendly and fast. It is in the Vons shopping center on the S/W corner of Lincoln and Tustin ave. in the city of Orange. They are one of the few stores that is no longer open 24hrs, but worth a visit.

<text>Horrible Food Quality! I live .01 miles away from this location and visit at least once a week. Everything I ordered was over cooked! I'm not sure if they are trying to save money on food costs, but it's affecting the food quality. First off the hash brown tasted as if they threw them into the dryer to warm them up. All the flavor was gone and hard. The Chorizo  which I've always raved about tasted as if it was the bottom ends of the container, as if it was sitting there for a long time. The chicken in the chicken quesadilla tasted as if it was for a different chicken product, and repurposed into the quesadilla.  I will be going to Taco Bell for my breakfast or the Tustin Ave location.  This used to be my favorite location.</text><username>Pepe-the-bartender</username><rate>1</rate></record>

OMG, this has gotta be the SLOWEST Del Taco I have ever been to. They took 25 minutes to make a 1/2 lb. burrito and that was it. Don't sit in the dining room until you get your food because nobody will come out to tell you your order is ready or if they call a name out you can't hear them from the other room.< /Text>

<Text>The employee working the counter was very nice very patient my partner who came with me was very undecided on what he wanted so she was courteous enough to let him take his time to figure out what he wanted didn't get upset the items that we ordered filled to the rim got all the sauces that we asked for the islands were to go she made sure that we had everything we needed in our bag so I would definitely go there again<//Text>< pics>

It looked alright and ate it because I was hungry but meat in the burrito was non-descript and hard.
Service was awesome tho and girl super nice....<//text>

I have never rated a fast food place before, but this one deserved it. The service was fantastic. The strawberry lemonade was devine. The food was ample and very delicious. We will find our way back!< /text>

Forget going here to this location after 6pm. It is surprisingly empty inside and their drive thru isn't that busy and yet it takes forever to get your food. I've gone twice to this location, 8pm and 12:30am. Both times it took 15mins to get the food we ordered. Only 2cars in drive thru. The person taking the orders could be heard repeatedly talk to the coworker rather than pay attention to the customers. The night crew needs to get it together. I'm not sure who's in charge but clearly they aren't doing their job.< /text>

<date>1551915464749<//date><review>I ordered a combo surf and turf burrito when I got up to the window and asked where my fries were they say combos don't come with fries I said so a Coke is $4 I go just give me an order of fries that was another 350 for a medium order of fries she said it says it on the sign I said no it doesn't go look. After the attitude she still maintained it's just a Coke and a burrito I said it should say just comes with drink not a combo I live close and I can tell you they get about half the food in the bag 60% of the time and the attitudes are horrible the other reviews on here I don't know how they got lucky I've been going there for 22 years just cuz it's close and generally there's a problem. Of course when I get home there's no receipt to prove any of this and you can never get ahold of corporate.
I'm writing Del Taco off my list enough is enough and when people come in and don't try to stuff it all in one bag so they can't see if their orders correct without ripping the bag or overturning it in the seat of your car they can't even wait for you to put your change up before they're telling you you have to take the coke enough.<//review>< pictures>

Typical fast food. I have been impressed with the service for the most part. However the place could use a remodel. [Hey franchisee, get on that!]< /Review>

I tend to always get someone with an attitude while taking my order..  I am sorry if you don't give me what I ask for, but when I politely ask for more sauce, you don't need to roll your eyes at me and give me attitude.  Your job is not at all hard.<//Text>

<review>Food was great this time except they over charged me for something I didn't get and the man at the drive thru was super rude for someone who didn't get my order fully correct. Only reason they got a 3 is the food was still good n fresh sice i did come at 9 am hahaha.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Standard fast food fare. There's nothing particularly special about this place. It can have really long lines during peak hours and service isn't always on-the-spot.< /text>

(Translated by Google) I consider the food good only the attention of the person in charge of the shift that was there when I visited, I kept talking and bashing with the other workers and very little attention for the client

Nice and clean facility, there are shipping and printing service and small shop to get packaging/office supplies.
The service is nice and friendly, but I saw only one person to handle both shipping and printing lines which could cause a quite long wait if I wouldn't use the express deposit box.</text>

<Review>Very disappointed with the customer service received at this location. Customer service agents had very little knowledge of how to assist with a simple request. In addition, they seemed like they simply wanted to avoid any customer engagement. Will stick to USPS services moving forward.<//Review>< date>

Enter the store at 7:58 p.m. and I just needed a single sheet print which takes literally 30 seconds. I've used their automated systems a number of times and it would not have taken me much to get it done but this person named Art showed me a clock that is incorrect and is ahead buy 5 minutes hence denying me my print and asking me to leave. Unfortunately this man was extremely rude and unaccommodating and this stores management needs to take corrective action against such lousy and incompetent people.< /Review>

This is located in a large strip mall with Ross, Safeway, etc., so pretty convenient. FedEx itself is set off to the side of this area so parking tends to be easier. I went on a weekday night at 7pm during holiday season. There were only 2 workers there. I wanted to send a package internationally but there were no instructions -- for instance, there appeared to be a standard international customs form next to the boxes so it stood to reason that's what I needed to fill out. I filled it out and spent 20-30min waiting in line, only to be told that I needed to fill out an entirely different form (that wasn't available in the obvious spot with all the various other forms), AND that my package would cost $100+ to send overseas (this is more than triple the rate of USPS) and there were no alternative pricing options. It was so preposterous that I ended up not sending the package, and found myself having wasted precious time after work and ending up back where I started. To its credit: one star for the awesome FedEx rep who was quite nice and apologized to each customer for the wait; one star for the wide variety of packaging supplies and other interesting office supply goods there. However, I walked away vowing never to use FedEx ever again, if I can help it. I'd have better luck praying upon good ol' Santa Claus to deliver my gifts. Bah humbug.</Text>

I love this place. The employees are friendly and approachable. Usually I can get helped immediately as there are rarely more than 2-3 customers inside at a time. The exception is when there happens to be someone shipping something extremely delicate/complicated when I come in, but the same goes for any print/ship shop. That said, it very rarely happens at this location. Best former kinkos in the bay</text>

I use this Fedex facility a lot. I have always had very good experience there. There is an young girl working at this location who is extremely competent, polite and helpful. It helps me a lot that they are open till 11p.m. I have always found it empty with no queues at night when I usually go. But I think  I had to wait a bit , a couple of times , when I went around 11a.m.. I  am very satisfied with the service at this Fedex office.</text>

They don't have paper label to handwritten address anymore.  You have to tell the worker at the store for him/her to type in the sender and receipant address, which takes time.  And there's usually only one worker there to help with all shipping related work, so expect a long wait time if you are not the first in line.< /Text>

<text>I had a worst experience  today shipping my package here. I had a properly packed box for shipment. However they insisted me to repack this box and repacked it with a bigger box stating it is free. Finally they charged me more since the package size was now bigger and also charged additional fees for packing. When I asked for the split the person refused to say why they charged me so much and instead was being rude.

For all this I had to wait for an hour since the person on the desk was new and din't  have proper experience in entering the data.

Hope my shipment reaches properly.

I don't even want to give a single star.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>1< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>Normally service is great, but they are usually understaffed. In this case I was next in line and the one employee working ignored me to help some other customer who then proceed to take 10 minutes detailing a print job... she will remain nameless, but then my man Rex showed up.

I recently attempted to print a single envelope and single letter, each 'standard' size.  The only available B&W printer was down (just as it was several months earlier when I went in), and no matter how the Kinkos employee and I tried we could not get the color printer to print an envelope.  The only good thing about this effort is that I was not charged for PC and printer time.< /Text>

I gave this store 1 star since there is no zero as option.

My printer at home was broken and I had to go to FedEx at  homestead road to print out sth for  my daughter last Thursday at 9pm which was due on the next day.  There was only one short guy working in the FedEx at the time when I came in.

I did not notice the printer I was trying to print was broken. When I realized it was broken, I had swiped my credit card for payment. I was seeking the short guy for  help but he was busy on his own stuff. Rather than come and help me fix the problem, he asked me to try on another machine. He said in another end of room and mentioned something about "receip", but I did not pay attention and did not hear what exactly he said since he was far from me.

After I finished my printout and took my receipt for payment, the short guy was totally lost his patience and in a bad attitudes. He blamed me that I told you not to print the receipt since it will make the return complicated.

Oh oh... I am sorry ... wait a moment, is it my problem? Should you fix the printer at the first place? Is it your work to resolve the problem no matter how "completed" it is?

Being a customer, i do not expect your respects but I do not expect a blame and bad attitude due to your problem!

Forget it!!! I did not ask him for my return and left the store, since I do not want to see his smellt face any more!!</review>

There was construction going on next door, so getting through to the parking lot was a bit of a hassle. You have to enter on the far entrance along Homestead. Enter on the entrance prior, and you'll be blocked by all the fences.

I had to use a computer to scan and print some stuff. The scanners are a bit slow.<//Review>

The service was decent. Had the brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was huge but mostly just ciabatta bun. The meat was a bit skimpy and totally flavorless. The sweet potato fries were superb.</Review>

Delicious diner food.  Great service and a perfect place to go with a family or if you have a wine hangover!  We loved it.  Plus the atmosphere is a lot of fun!</review>

<UserId.>111475146629606851801< /UserId.><Text>Food here was pretty good. Y wife had the chopped cobb, which was okay, but the blue cheese tasted a little weird.  The chicken club I got was really good, especially with a side of their honey mustard.  It seemed like they didn't have enough staff, so the wait was a little longer than I would have liked.  Overall it is a cheap option for breakfast or lunch if you are in the downtown Napa area.< /Text><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Me: Oh baby! This steak, salad, onion rings, cornbread and green beans sure look good.

Wife: yeah they do. I can't wait to eat.

Me: Steak perfect. Food is so freaking good.

Wife: How about you hand over your wallet?

That's when I remembered that I'm not married and this person I've been talking to is actually a robber and here to take all my stuff. But this food is so good that I am totally disinterested in what's going on with said robber and after spacing off for a bit, thinking about what my steak could possibly be seasoned with, I came back to Earth and realized that my dog is now attacking said robber..........

Pepper is all I came up with in the end. Maaaaaaybe garlic salt. But that's because I ate this steak too fast and didn't really pay attention visually. Now I need to call the police to come clean up this robber's mess. Blood and hair everywhere.

Anyone know of a good stain remover?

Thank you for the great food Black Bear Diner<//Text>< user>

<Review>So I ordered DoorDash that was 60$...  two separate meals,  One with pancakes, the other with a waffle
Eggs came with both of the meals

Food was delicious

But no syrup/butter and no condiments

That would just be common sense no?

I had to wait for the hotels food service to open to Order hotel syrup lol</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>Wait time was long, staff attribute it to COVID restrictions on indoor dining capacity, but it appeared like they were just standing around most of the time; not professional.
Food was decent, for the price. I got a waffle with fruit, and my companion had the avocado toast. They were underwhelmed with their meal, but I enjoyed my meal with a few cups of Black Bear's coffee. We both got drinks and my friend got a side of potatoes. Came out to about $30.
I imagine that if COVID were not as much of a concern, this would have been a much better experience, which is why I gave this place 3 stars. But overall, I'd recommend you go to IHOP, just across the street, unless you want a sweet cream waffle.<//Review>< pics>

Delicious food. Great service. 1st time at the Napa location. Togo. They got the order right and provided extra ketchup,  tartar sauce and even included fresh lemon and vinegar for my fish n' chips. Excellent job!< /Text>

Always love the food. A true diner vibe to the place; only complaint is that the drinks are nothing special.</Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>This was a terrible experience,  the food was severed cold,  the all you can eat fish, chips, coleslaw and hush puppies were a one time serving and they were out of hush puppies. I received a second order of fish to go and finally got the coleslaw to go as well. Even the normally delicious Bearclaws were sub par, no royal icing and barely any filling.  I was extremely disappointed,  normally Black Bear Diner is one of my favorites.</Review>< pictures>

Typical Black Bear awesomeness.  Huge portions for the price.  Excellent service.  Only 4 stars though because they have the A/C set to like 30 degrees inside.<//text>

<Review>This was actually one of the highlights to our Napa experience. Adorable atmosphere, friendly waitress. It was very well priced and it was the perfect, carb-y meal to start on a day of wine tastings. Large portions too. The cinnamon roll French toast was incredible.  We’ve been craving it since!<//Review></record>

Not as corny a restaurant as the name might suggest. The waitstaff both accommodating and efficient. I had a breakfast dish,...a variation on an Eggs Benedict, sans meat. My own special request. Our Server didn’t bat an eye! Food was delicious! And the portions were quite generous. The bill wasn’t too unreasonable. The only thing that I can say, and this is common in most restaurants, I found it a bit difficult to get the attention of the wait person, once the lunch crowd arrived.< /Text>

My coffee cup had lipstick, and my plate had stains on it, from previous food because the dishes weren't washed right. BBD needs to do a better job on cleaning the dishes and the staff serving the food needs to work on their attention to detail. My hashbrowns were burnt.< /Text>

A great little restaurant. They serve breakfast throughout the day as well as lunch and dinner options. There are salads available if you want to eat light or if you looking for a vegan snack and there's always highs for dessert.

Restaurants welcomes toddlers teens adults as well as aging adults it is handicapped accessible there are bathrooms for use parking is free and abundant I'm not sure if they allow service animals they're open from 6 a.m. till 10 p.m. I have found myself there on a number of occasions each time I'm greeted in a friendly manner most of them remember where I like to sit for what I like to drink I always find it clean the food cooked to order and the staff friendly.<//text>

< review>
I always love going to the Black Bear Diner! Their portions are large and their prices are reasonable. If you're going with more than two people plan on a wait no matter when you go. If it's just you or you and one other person you can usually get immediate seating if you're willing to sit at the bar stools. In all the years I've been going to Black Bear Diner's across the state, I have never ever had a problem with their food. If you've never been you need to try them!<//review>

Ordered the fried chicken. Had way too breading and was over cooked.

Tasted like it was cooked last week and then put in the deep fryer to reheat.

Not impressed!!<//Review>

I will say, add a little more crunch and grease to the shredded breakfast potatoes.  My go to is the country fried steak and eggs.  There is a mondo size but I would die as it is a lot of food.  Love the rye bread, nice and thick.  I'm a fan of the coffee too, nice deep robust flavor.  Comfort food at its best!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Tried to order food for like 5 minutes, before they closed because I wanted my food to be hot and fresh when my dad went to pick it up and it was a last-minute order. But the first time I called, it kept ringing for a solid 3 minutes. The second time I called, I head a loud beep that nearly deafened me, and there was no voice on the other line. I tried to say "hello?" several times, but there was definitely no one on the line. The third time I called, they waited until 8 on the dot to pick up the phone (closing time) and said "sorry, we're closed and can't take any orders." So clearly there was someone there to pick up the phone the whole time, they just deliberately chose not to answer until after closing time so that I couldn't order dinner. It was incredibly rude, and if their staff are like that then they don't deserve your money. I would advise getting your dinner elsewhere.</review>< name>

Black Bear Diner has been consistently one my favorite breakfast joints. Unfortunately, the service and food were horrible today. We sat at the counter and watched our food sit under the warmer for 15 minutes. A server ate a fry off a plate, and even after our breakfast was served we had to wait for eating utensils. Our food was barely warm and lacked the consistency we’ve experienced in the past.< /review>

My family and I went here for dinner on 8/22/19. We had the best restaurant experience eve . The staff was very professional and exceptionally friend and kind. Our waitress ( I believe her name was Luci) was the greatest waitress ever. I can't say enough heck words can't explain how awesome of a waitress and person she is. Looking forward to going back here again<//text>

<Text>This place has a great atmosphere and aesthetic. The interior looks better than the average Black Bear Diner. The service is great, and the food is perfectly fine. However, the location of this restaurant is its biggest downfall. They are positioned right next to an IHOP, which is cheaper and not that much worse in quality. However, I would still recommend it.</Text><userid>114189419628410662490<//userid>< resp>

Crowded, popular and noted that large parties had a very long wait for their orders. Food is good. Reasonably priced.<//Review>

We ordered online for curbside pickup.  The restaurant is understaffed and do not answer the phone so no curbside.  Potatoes were undercoked.  The rest of our meal, Bigfoot Chicken Fried Steak, was OK.
Curbside pickup should not be an online option without staffing for it.< /text>

WOW,WHAT GREAT FOOD!!!  And plenty of it, even when we ordered from the Lesser Menu.  Everything was done right and had excellent flavor.  Did not have any dessert but you could make a meal with just one dessert.</text>

It was Halloween and the manager was dressed in a skimpy unprofessional costume. We ordered food to go and asked 4 times for extra gravy and if mashed potatoes come with the open faced turkey. Twice the girl that took our order said it did. When we got home no potatoes or extra gravy. Apparently it's more important for them to leave early then take care of their customers.

Black Bear is my favorite go to restaurant when we're on a road trip. This location disappointed both of us. We stopped in around 7 PM on a Sunday expecting the usual stellar experience we have always had at other locations. When we walked in there were several employees at the hostess area but we were not acknowledged or greeted by any of them for what seemed like an eternity. We were seated in a booth in a quiet area. Our drink order was not taken by the host who seated us as it usually is at other locations  and it was several minutes before we saw the waitress. She seemed new and quite nervous as we placed our drink order asking us if we wanted water in our iced tea then corrected herself and asked if we wanted lemon in it. Placing our food order was difficult as the first three items we chose were sold out. My GF settled for the third item on the menu that sounded good to her. I had to settle for the third item also. I don't understand a restaurant being out of signature items so early in the evening. The items were Chicken Pot pie, pot roast and onion rings. I could forgive them being out of one item but three in row is three strikes and you're out! The waitress was sweet and apologetic but poorly trained. This was truly a disappointing experience for us.  Not only was the restaurant out of the food we wanted to order but the meal I settled for was not properly prepared and very disappointing flavor wise.</Text>

Even though you usually have a short wait for Saturday morning breakfast/brunch it is well worth the wait. I love it when we get Michelle as our waitress. She is always so up beet and kind. The food is always good and plentiful. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want even if it's not on the menu. Their French toast is amazing and they even have French toast made out of their cinnamon rolls if you really want to be sinful.  I have a noise sensitivity and am disabled, so when we go they are always kind enough to try and find us a booth that is in the corner. Enjoy!!😄</Review>

My family and I went to Black Bear Diner in Napa for lunch and I ordered the chicken tenders and I liked the ranch and barbecue sauce it was really good I couldn't decide which I liked better so I chose both. The proportion sizes were big for when you're really hungry. The place had great customer service and one of the waiters were really nice and friendly which I like to see in any restaurant and for the food it was fast and it didn't took long to come by. I will come back and order those chicken tenders, once I come and visit Napa again.</Text>

Had the BIG FOOT AND PAN CAKES . The meat got thinner and the breading got thicker . The hash browns were more of a ribbon cut and a little to burnt in some spots . Other spots weren't browned at all . The grill was too hot , and we're cooked too fast . The eggs were perfect and the PAN CAKES were GREAT 👍. Server was polite and fast .  I should have gotten the ribeye dinner it's only 2 bucks more . All in all I left belly bulging feeling nice and fat . Your Friend Johnny</review>

When you spend around $70 for breakfast for 3 people, it should be MUCH better than this! The California omelet should just be a mushroom omelet, really dry with a couple little slivers of brown avocado on top...yuck. Also, paid extra for gravy, didn't receive. We will NOT be coming here again and nor should you!< /Review>< gmapID>

I am definitely going back. The portions are good and the food is good. I've been passing this place by for years just haven't taken the time to go in. The staff was great kept my coffee full. I had the big burger I don't remember the name but it was awesome. Will be getting another tasty meal there next time I go through Napa. Can't wait<//text>

<response>None</response><review>The absolute best breakfast in Napa.  We go here almost every morning on our visits to Napa.  Great way to start the day before tasting endless amounts of wine.  I can promise you will almost never finish your entire plate.  They always make sure to give you plenty of food.  Menu is pretty large.  The pancakes are my favorite thing on the menu.  Good mimosa's too!  See you guys again soon.<//review><user_id>102212419656914974082< /user_id><time>1559930014335<//time><gmap_id>0x8085060e6ab52965:0x5c46475997b07c31</gmap_id>< Pics>

<Text>I figured they had new staff after 2 years so I thought I'd give this place another shot.

Came in by myself,. And simply only requested a table.  After waiting a half hour the waitress wanted to put me in a booth sitting in a chair in the aisle.

If you're not going to let me eat at the location you right up front so I don't have to sit around and waste my bloody time

I still recommend highly going someplace else.</Text><user_name>JC Randall</user_name>< Resp>

This place has really gone downhill.  I got a piece of meat that was 30% fat.  I can't even believe they served it to me.

I have a pic but can't attach it with my phone.  Just nasty!!

Updated:  I added a pic.  See for yourself!< /Review>

<Review>Definitely went beyond expectations in terms of food and service. The pancakes are to die for - their recipe is seriously one of, if not, the best I've ever had - so butter and fluffy, yet creamy as well. It is easy to mess up breakfast, but they do it well here and with a smile. Love the theme of the restaurants as well and the fact they support the community and organizations, such as the National Park Service. Very cozy and enjoyable experience.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x8085060e6ab52965:0x5c46475997b07c31<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The server was very nice..  But, what's up with the dude who delivers the food?  He should be working at Domino's Pizza..

I ask the guy add some garlic bread to my order as he delivers it..  And, he laughs in my face.. I kid you not.  It was so bad, I confronted him about it.. Then I left, and didn't eat the food..< /Text><rating>1</rating><Time>1508118825313< /Time></record></dataset><record>

My young adult kids love this special place, but unless you want a lot of only big pieces of lettuce and stuff thrown together in a taco salad then please don't get this. My other experiences have always been really positive!
The staff is awesome too<//review>

I have been to Black Bear restaurants before. They are basically the same. The food is always good. This particular Black Bear restaurant however, the hostess was terrific.  More than usual and the waiter did an excellent job. They all seem to really want to work.  It was quite refreshing to see American people actually wanting to work</Text>

<Text>I wasn't impressed at all! I ordered a medium well classic hamburger with sweet potatoe fries, and I got, a rare hamburger with burnt sweet potatoe fries, fewer than a McDonald small order of fries! It was awful! That was the first and last time I'm going there! I only gave it two stars because at least the order was ready when we picked it up!<//Text></record>

A bit of a wait but not too bad. Service was really nice, friendly, food was good especially the sweet potato fries, honestly the best I've tried.</text>

Didn't have the Trump tip again.  Until I said this is second time and we were going to leave.  Waiter went and asked them to cut some up for us and they did.   It wasn't exactly as rare as I like and it was chewy.  But, he did try.</review>

<review>I recently went to Black Bear, and never have I gotten worse food poisoning. Got regular pancakes with scrambled eggs and fruit, came home and my gut was growling like a damned grizzly. Only reason I'm giving it two stars is because our service was good. Valentino was very pleasant and didn't just disappear as soon as you sat down.< /review>< UserId.>

<rate>2<//rate><review>I passed a poster for Black Bear, they said they had a new menu.  They do and most of what changed was their prices: no surprise, they went up.  They are still one of the slowest restaurants in Napa, where waitresses walk by and purposefully ignore someone because it is not their station. I am not thinking there is anyone overseeing the place as staff wander around in pairs, talking but no one is attentive to the patrons. It was sad. So if personable service by someone is what you want: go someplace else.  It is still a ton of food for an order.  If you can make the wait.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>Revised! Up  from 3 to 4 stars. We ended up going back for dinner. It was a much better service.
The food is reasonably priced and portions are generous. The service was subpar. Except for my toast, the food was good. My toast was served burnt. The waitress never came back to inquire if food was ok, did not ask when she picked up plates ( and uneaten burnt toast). The gentleman that took our money did not ask if food, service was ok, nor thank us for coming in.</text>< pics>

The server was excellent the open face hot turkey sandwiche was terrible. So salty was the gravey I could feel my arteries harding lol. Sent it back brought me another plate of just turkey ...the turkey was also salty. Gave up at that point. I usually love the food there I eat all the time at the one in Vallejo.  Was not the servers fault she tried so hard to make it right even offering me different items from the menu. I could see both cook looking over at my table so at that point I was uncomfortable. I got a Black Bear Gift card for Christmas think I will use it in Vallejo.<//review>

I love the portions at black bear, i actually used a to go box and that's rare! The food was really good on my breakfaet visit. This location in napa tends to be packed most of the time. The service at the 'bar' was decent except that i was able to watch my meal sit under the heat lamp for about 5-10 minutes and we got a kick out of the tv screen that showed 0% of orders were going out on time.</Text>

The employees work very hard to keep guests happy.
There is delicuous food, and great service from the moment you walk in. Definitely a place to go with family, friends, and on holidays. The wait it worth it indeed. Thanks Black Bear!</Review>

My wife ordered biscuits and gravy. We found numerous strands of long dark brown hair mixed in her biscuits. I had southern scramble with biscuits and gravy. Wife would not eat hers, but mine was good, but too much country potatoes.</text>

I hadn't been here in years because I didn't really like it but gave it another shot. Unfortunately it was a disappointing meal. The biscuits were big but tasted gross and had a wierd texture. And the hash browns were barely cooked at all. It's a shame though cause the service is always top notch.< /text>

<text>The food was over cooked and not very good. Fries were almost burnt and chicken strips dry. No dressing on Cole slaw. Fish was tough and no flavor, over cooked.  We were traveling and have come to expect consistency from the Black Bear chain, but we're very disappointed with Napa Black Bear. We will not eat there again.<//text><resp>{'time': 1521236023842, 'text': 'We’re sorry to hear your experience at Black Bear Diner wasn’t up to snuff.

<Text>BEARS BEETS BATTLESTAR GALLACTICA

Bur seriously... SO MANY F*****G BEARS.

Oh btw, they serve food. And it comes in bear size portions. The surprising thing is that it's actually really good! The vegetables (though hard to find) are fresh and flavorful, the meats are plentiful, the biscuits as large as your fist and the service is exceptional.< /Text><gmap_id>0x8085060e6ab52965:0x5c46475997b07c31< /gmap_id><Date>1495996712792</Date><name>Hugh Williams< /name>< UserId.>

Usually my favorite place to eat. However I was very disappointed with the slow service on our last visit.  After our food was brought out our server took what seemed like forever to check up on us.  I ordered the all you can eat fish fry.  By the time she came to check on us our whole table was completely done eating. I wanted a second serving of fish, only to be left waiting longer to finally have the manager come over 5 minutes later to tell me they ran out. Really?  We were seated before 7pm. All I'm saying is that if you can't keep up with the demand for a promotion that you are putting on then end the promotion.< /review>

Black Bear Diner is always a hit and always busy whenever we come.  Today was opening day for Little League 2018 -- so why not?  Honestly, we were in Buttercream's parking lot -- which didn't have a stall to park in ..so we ended up here.
Party of 3 -- around 11 in the morning .. about a 20 minute wait she says.  I'm telling you, it was packed!  And it was a Saturday haha.  They didn't take longer than maybe 10 minutes -- super quick for them.  We was hangry too.  So hangry my son didn't order from the kids' menu AND he ate all his food.  That almost never happens.  The man had an omelette and one waffle.  The kid had chocolate chip pancakes (2), 2 over easy eggs and bacon.  I had my usual chicken fried steak and eggs with their hash.  We were very pleased .. with the food and the service.  Will we come back?  Heck yes!!<//review>

This place is terrible, service is too slow, waitress was kind of rude, food was lacking on flavor and poor technique. You can see there are not very capable cooks in  that place. We had to wait a lot for a table and it wasn't worth it at all. Not going back ever. First and last.</text>

<Review>4 of 5 stars to the Black Bear Diner on Soscol Ave in Napa, CA. I've been to several Black Bear Diner's and so my comment will reflect the others also. BBD is a great place for a great big meal! Each has a somewhat unique atmosphere with plenty of black bears about to keep you company. BBD is great for breakfast and I highly recommend "Bruce's Meat Lover Omelet". For dinner I suggest you be very very hungry and go for a "Bob's Big Bear Burger". I do highly recommend Black Bear Diner.<//Review>< name>

<Text>Worst experience in my life.  Food was cold , ordered then was told was out of the product i requested then I reorder to be told ten min later they ran out of that too. When i finally reserved my food it was cold i asked for it mid rair . Yet it looked as tasted a if my food was sitting on counter for several hours. Was rubber and rough  Even after i made my complaint to the one in charge all i got was a I'm sorry several times with no resolution.  Bad food,  dirty bathroom no tp. Orders where plated with the wrong idioms and had to be replated all they did was scrape from one plate to the other for my company and I  .  I was completely appoled on how this place was ran.  Pore food and pore management.  Do not go here unless you want to have a bad day.<//Text>< Date>

We arrived her from PUC in Agwin for a late night celebration for my daughter's performance and received lousy service. We had a table of seven and did not receive all our fries. When I questioned it the waiter said they had ran out and turned off the friers.
No discount was given and I paid full price.< /Text>

Horrible service , when I say bad oh boy ! They got every order wrong ( 5 people ) , we had to ask for everything, more water , our side orders ,, it was brutal ! Then we asked to speak to the manager and he said oh I’m sorry , stood there and then walked away ! NEVER AGAIN !!!!!< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I have been to that place 2 times and the first time they gave us a table but they took a long time to attend us, in the end we left the place and no one ever came to take the order, the second time it was worse we were just standing at the entrance waiting to be served , they only looked at us but nobody attended us and the place was little crowded 😒 bad experience

He ido 2 veces a ese lugar y la primera vez  nos dieron una mesa pero tardaron muchísimo para atendernos, al final nos fuimos del lugar y nunca nadie llegó a tomar la orden, la segunda vez fue peor solo estuvimos parados en la entrada esperando hacer atendidos, solo nos miraron pero nadie nos atendió y el lugar estaba poco concurrido 😒 mala experiencia< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>
