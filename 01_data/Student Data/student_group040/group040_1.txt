My husband and I have been customers for over 25 yrs.  The service we've received has been stellar hands down (plus great rates).  That is why I only recommend State Farm to family and friends.  It's as simple as this. I am still a customer after all these years. "If it isn't broke don't try to fix it".< /text>

We've been with Kevin Lowry/State Farm for about 10 years and he has always without fail taken care of all our concerns and needs regarding both our auto insurance and home insurance which we have bundled together through his office. State Farm's rates are consistently low, and the personal service is really priceless for the peace of mind it gives. In today's world the personal touch means so much!  What was exceptional was State Farm discounted our auto insurance rates by 2/3 during the coronavirus, it's insurance with a heart!< /Text>

I’ve never had an issue with Kevin Lowry. Every time I call I’m asked how my day was and they’re just so kind. Any issue or question I have they’re always quick with finding out info and solving them! Super Satisfied! Even when they’re busy they will make sure they call you back and solve your problems! I personally ask for Jessica Salinas if I ever need anything and she’s a super nice person and very good at what she does! I appreciate her great customer service, and wether its in person or the phone it’s always good!</text>

< review>
I met with Kevin Lowry to hear  about different options for life insurance policies. I was pretty skeptical at first because I have had bad experiences with “pushy salesman”. Kevin was not pushy at all. He was very professional, thorough and answered all my questions. I did not feel pressured at all. I did end up making the decision that purchasing life insurance was good for my family. It was a quick and easy process to get insured. Everyone I worked with was very helpful and easy to get a hold. Wether you think you need life insurance or not, I would definitely recommend at the least setting up a meeting with Kevin Lowry to hear your options.<//review>

My wife and my experiences with Kevin Lowry and team has been and continuing to be overwhelmingly positive. Our agent, Jonathan, is responsive, clear, and timely with our needs. Kevin and team are always willing to set time aside to answer our follow up questions and assure we leave happy with the answers. Recently when our situation seemed to turn for the worst, Jonathan stuck through it with us and encouraged us to stay positive and hopeful. Can’t recommend them enough!< /Text>

I have enjoyed their service for years. I have also shopped around and they have offered me the most coverage for the best price. Their loyalty discounts pay off. Sharon and Jessica are my go to people. They answer all my questions- and I have lots! Haha. I moved far from this office but still have them because they are great!</Review>

<Text>I have had nothing but positive experiences working with this agency. My representative Jon Huse has been an absolute pleasure to work with, being very responsive every time I have had a question, and always explaining everything in great detail.  With so many options and moving parts, both buying a policy and dealing with a claim can be very overwhelming at times, and I’m glad that Mr. Huse has been there to walk me through every step of the way. You definitely don’t get this kind of touch with other companies. I look forward to working with him for many years to come.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Kevin Lowry has been my family's insurance agent for over 5 years. Both he and his office staff have been very responsive to any questions, issues we've had. I recently had an accident with my car and he was instrumental in ensuring that my Porsche was repaired with the proper parts--something that wouldn't have happened without his interceding in the process. We have all of our home and auto insurance with him and will continue for years to come.< /Text>< Pictures>

Working with Kevin has been a great experience.  He has been my auto and home insurance agent for about 10 years.  What I like most about Kevin and his team is their friendliness and reliability.  Whenever I need help, they are there for me.  Kevin has always been able to understand my needs, and has been a very trusted advisor.  Keep up the great work!<//Text>

Kevin has been my insurance agent for 10+ years now, and I worked with him for about 8 years before that!  He is extremely reliable and responsive.  I don't know the staff too well but they have all been very friendly and extremely helpful as I have moved, gotten married, and purchased cars over those 10+ years.  I don't know much about the insurance industry, so it is very comforting to have an agent I know I can trust!< /Review>

Linda takes care of all my personal and business insurance needs. I am a Realtor and highly recommend my clients to call Linda when they are looking for an insurance professional. Her knowledge of the many real estate closing issues is exceptional and  she helps make the process seamless.
Linda even helped me get a car loan through State Farm; great rates!

I have been with State Farm insurance for a very long time, We love Kevin Lowry's office for so many reasons.
The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable!
I can get an appointment quickly to discuss whatever questions I might have.
I use this office for my auto insurance, my daughters auto insurance, personal belongings insurance, life insurance, House insurance and investment property insurance.
I also recently refinanced my car through this office and it was quick and easy, I had a check in my hand the same day!
They never fail me.<//review>

State Farm Insurance has always been there for us on our home and auto insurance and now our RV. The Kevin Lowry office are always friendly and professional, we deal with Sharon Snyder and she knows us by name and she is very helpful with all our needs and fights to get us the lowest and best rates. She explains what everything our coverage includes and makes sure we know exactly what we’re paying for.< /Text>

I was with All State for a couple of years but I wasn't happy with the customer service so I decided it was time to look somewhere else. I started calling around and after my 3rd phone call to different insurance companies, I called Kevin Lowry's office (State Farm) and spoke with Maria. She was able to help me on the spot and was a pleasure to speak with. I am now a member because of the excellent customer service I'd received. She keeps me informed with any changes on my policy so that way I am not surprised which is important to me. Thank you so much!!! :)< /review>

My family has been with State Farm since before Kevin took over the Oakhurst office. I have worked mainly and directly with the staff who all are knowledgeable, efficient and personable. Linda has been my primary contact and puts up with my questions, soothes my fears, and patiently forgives my occasional late installment payments. Who would have thought dealing with yucky insurance stuff could wind up being a pleasure??? Kevin must be doing something right to hold onto such good people!<//review>

<review>I first became a customer of State Farm Auto Insurance way back in 1949 when in high school I purchased my first car.  From 1949 in Santa Monica, CA my agent being Carl Moore, all the way up to Kevin Lowry in Oakhurst, CA in 2013, a total of 66 plus years and at least six or more different agents over the years, I have nothing but praise for their expertise and caring attention to my needs. I included a couple of homes insured also. I'm sure rates could have been possibly less with some of the many companies available, but SERVICE is important and that is what I enjoyed over the years with State Farm. Thank you!!</review><Gmap_id>0x809427910e9061e5:0x584cd94db6c1644d</Gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< rating>

I work for Pacific Central Management Corporation here in Fresno and have dealt with Kevin Lowry's State Farm company continuously throughout the last year. Not only is his staff extremely friendly but they are quick and sufficient! Any time I've called and needed work or information to be done Maria Gonzalez has always gone above and beyond to help me out! Pacific Central has nothing but great things to say about Kevin's insurance agency!< /Text>

Whether my inquiries are related to my current lines of insurance - Auto, Home or Life or my new auto loan through State Farm Bank, I have always received personalized service and care ! Everyone at Kevin Lowry's office  responds to my needs as a person and not a number or 'ticket' which is so refreshing these days. Though the team has moved to Fresno from Oakhurst, I still receive prompt, friendly and sincere service and always feel like State Farm family! Thanks to Kevin, Linda and the team I feel a huge amount of confidence in products and services that always fit my circumstances!< /review>< pics>

Kevin Lowry at State Farm has been my Auto and Home Insurance person for over 8 years and I highly recommend him and his agency, for ALL your insurance need's.

His office staff is highly trained and very helpful in handling any problems that may arise for you, from time to time.

If I were shopping for Insurance, Kevin Lowry is the Agent I would go to, with out a doubt.

I completely trust Kevin as our Insurance Agent.  He is very knowledgeable, honest and diligent.  I appreciate that he came and evaluated our home after 3 years of remodeling to modify our policy, in case something disasterous occurred we are completely covered.  Thank you Kevin!</review>

<Text>I've lived in the Westlake Community for the majority of my life time. This local Bakery is my go for nearly everything, from Mexican sweet bread to Mása (dough to make Tamales and Sopés) Their pricing range is very economical as well.
I definitely recommend more people to come to this Bakery<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Let's all be safe,  I've been wanting Golden China for a while but have been staying home. Doing my part with the virus I went and got some food.  Safety was first but we also talked  6 feet apart  Reminiscing and seeing how each other's family was doing during this time. Prays up to everyone</Review>

He pointed down the street and said Golden China......so my son and I gave it a try.

We walked in and were greeted by the friendly owner.  I mentioned that her place was referred to us; and she proceeded to tell us that they had been in business over 30 yrs...same location.   She was extremely warm and gracious.

I ordered a combination plate and my son had General chicken and we split a sweet and sour soup.  We received large portions of everything and the food was very, very tasty.

Ironically we had tried almost every Chinese restaurant in the area but somehow missed this one until today.

My son said what I was already thinking.....this will be our 'go to' Chinese restaurant from now on.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

To be honest, the food here wasn’t that great. After we ate, we waited 20 minutes until they asked us if we wanted a box for our food. And there was only one other couple next to us. No one checked up on us at all. So in short, I didn’t think they deserved a tip (we even had 3 different servers wait on us), and I left no tip as we weren’t well attended and waited 20 minutes to get a box of food. Another 10 to get our check and pay. After we left, our “waitress” had the nerve to chase us down on the street and say “you forgot MY tip” she didn’t take our order, give us the tea, take our check, or give us boxes. The only thing she did was she bring our food. Idk how she thought she deserved a tip and yet had the audacity to demand, even chasing us down outside. Never going back again.</review>

Our regular go to place for take out. I think they have a new chef as some of the dishes have changed in flavor. Mostly for the better! Basil chicken is more saucy, mu shu pork has a lot more flavor and ingredients in it and the fried rice has much more meat in it. On the flip side, the dragon beef isn't as good. Sticky sweet and wet. Not crispy like it used to be. Service is good,Food is ready very quickly and they aim to please.< /Text>

This is the best Chinese food restaurant I've ever been to! There are so many healthy options, like the mix vegetables, and the green bean chicken. Everything is really flavorful, and the menu is large so there is a lot to choose from.</Review>

This place is consistent with making delicious Chinese food at extremely affordable prices. Plus, they always serve a mountain of food whether you dine-in or order to go. Customer service is great! Juan remembers the orders of returning customers, and that makes me feel appreciated and understand she's dedicated to providing the best customer service. My family and I have eaten here many times in the past and will continue returning!< /review>

For an in inexpensive pizza skip Little Caesars and head to Pronto Pizza.  The chicken wings with the Habanero sauce is great. Good customer service is a plus.</Review>

I called to place an order for 2 pizzaz with just pepperoni at the Pronto Pizza in La Puente on Sunset. The attendant told me because they were so busy they could not take my order. I have always had a great experience and love the pizza but telling customers that "sorry we're really busy and adding your order is not possible at time time" is not the best thing to say to the consumer. I asked to talk to the Manager to better assist me and was denied that also. I will never go back to Pronto Pizza and will also tell my friends and family to stop going there as well.

I really hope Management reads this and does something about it as I'm sure I'm not the first person that's been told this and in any business without costumers/consumers there is no profit and hence no business.</Text>

The female worker was yelling and demanding the male worker around while he joked with her and continued to annoy her in purpose. Looks like they are short on staff too bc they were running around like chickens without there heads and were very unorganized.</Review>< pictures>

Un lugar pequeñito, a bordo de carretera, con estacionamiento, las pizzas muy ricas, lo que más me encanto fue que cambian la salsa de jitomate por frijoles, los cual las hacen diferentes, únicas y muy ricas, ellos también ofrecen especial oh combos con diferentes opciones, así que de las recomiendo al 💯 % también porque las señoritas que atienden son tan, tan amables y eso es mucho mejor, porque así es como uno regresa, no solo por el sabor de la comida si no por el servicio al cliente.< /text>

What a wonderful lunch outdoor in the early spring. This is perhaps so far my favorite Asian-fusion restaurant in town. Plates were small and really meant to be shared. You cannot miss the lobster roll - golden airy ultra-crispy bread plus fresh lobster meat with minimalist seasoning - it must embody the soul of lobster rolls! The soup of the clam chowder was a bit too salty but the quality clams themselves were incomparable. We also loved the steak bao - the steak was so tender and juicy and there was such a refreshing harmony among all the ingredients. The dessert was named "cloudy with a chance of apples" - not only good-looking but truly tasty. Look forward to coming back later.<//Review>

The tea leaf salad was good but used cabbage more so than tea leaf? The noodles were a bit too acidic for me. The fried crab rice had good flavor but I wouldn't call it refined. The best for me was the fried whole fish, which had a nice fresh crispness to it.
The service seemed very amateurish. Asked for a kid friendly option and was suggested an off menu chicken dish and was assured it wasn't spicy. It was brought out and the server said it was the spicy chicken dish. Our server assured us it wasn't spicy again but sure enough out child couldn't eat it. We didn't send it back and they didn't offer anything as a gesture either. It was tasty if a bit typical.
In sum I'm not sure about the hype with this place because it certainly seemed busy.</Text>< pics>

Candace (sp?), our server, was fantastic.  She was knowledgeable and positive.  Uni was fresh, beef and broccoli was a highlight.  Butterfish was good.  Fried rice was underwhelming.  Thai ice cream was delicious but the scoop was so small I thought for a moment they forgot to plate the dessert.  Like the decor and the patio is comfortable.  Tea was good quality but the pot is huge and takes up too much for a tiny dinner table.< /text>

Personally didn't like how much cilantro was in all the food, but if you like cilantro, you'll like lukshon. The pork belly was cooked to perfection, and their egg plant was my favorite dish of all of them. Their lobster roll was also really good because of the amazing bread. I wouldn't recommend the butterfish though, it just didn't work with my palette</Text>

Lukshon's "Heirloom Black Rice" is a twisted take on the spicy Indonesian fried rice dish, nasi goreng. Black rice, first harvested in China and thought to facilitate good health and long life, is not traditional in nasi goreng, and is often referred to as "forbidden rice" due to it being reserved exclusively for emperors during the Ching and Ming dynasties. On its own, it possesses a distinct nutty flavor and a firm, chewy texture. Here, it is stir-fried with sweet and smoky bits of lap cheong (Chinese sausage), onions, and so much roasted garlic I'm sure I still breathe out remnants of it today. On top of the rice rests a sunny-side up egg with whites set too loose for my liking. And although all of this stuff and a distinct blast of white pepper and diced chilis may seem overwhelming, it is the rice that is clearly the focus of the dish. I am unimpressed with my initial bite; it tastes familiar, but it's just garlicky fried rice, right? When half a bowl somehow disintegrates, I realize I have crossed the point of no return and I must finish the job. I pretend I'll treadmill it all off later.

I had similar reactions with all of the food I've eaten at Lukshon: despite relentless leverage of aromatics and pan-Asian flavor bombs, there is something evocative about it all, leaving the most compelling aspects of the dish understated, so that an impromptu craving is built for those shrouded elements. This appears to be the skilled and purposeful scheme of chef Sang Yoon, a French-trained cook of Korean origin, who worked for Wolfgang Puck and Joel Robuchon before revitalizing gastropub "Father's Office," where he's made his name selling one of L.A.'s best burgers: a medium-rare concoction on a garlic bun featuring a pungent blue cheese and a bacon compote.

The format here is much different: small plates of Asian comfort food given a "haute continental" treatment. Lukshon, a play on the Yiddish word for noodles (to honor Yoon's surrogate Jewish grandmother), is the kind of place that would have demanded crisp white linens and fine stemware before the post-gourmet revolution reduced our collective expectations for fine dining. This doesn't mean that Lukshon is frivolous. Quite the opposite: this is a serious restaurant operated by an autocrat who insists you eat by his rules.

What I admire most about Lukshon is the restaurant's intolerance for customers seeking to sabotage their meals. Don't bother asking for a substitution or omission, because Lukshon is not going to make you a peanut-free version of their dumplings, or vegetarian version of their black rice. There are plenty of other kitchens that will take your money and let you ruin your meal. When you make the kind of food that Yoon makes, there exists an artistic integrity to each dish, an amalgamation of personal beliefs, creativity, heart, and soul. I sympathize with those with allergies and insensitivities, but you can't expect serious creators to compromise their work for you. I'm red-green colorblind, but I'm not asking Warhol to dull the rich, vibrant hues of Marilyn Diptych so I can perceive them better.

My favorite dish here was the "Lobster Roll Banh Mi," two great sandwiches combined into one. On a buttered bun rests a rich, creamy lobster salad accessorized with a pig ear terrine flavored with soy sauce and rice wine with ginger and onions, similar to Filipino adobo. Then there are these funky pickles along with a shredded green papaya in a tangy and spicy nuoc cham vinaigrette (made with Yoon's house-made fish sauce), channeling a sum tum salad, but with cleaner, tidier flavors.

My server was knowledgeable about the menu and polite, but not yet worldly enough to discuss the dishes that inspired the menu. But worry not: Lukshon's subtle and spirited nods to southeast Asian classics offer a sumptuous primer beyond what a conversation with any server could ever deliver.< /Text>

For apps we had the poke & scallops. Happy I tried it as both were done perfectly but nothing outstanding being from Lukshon where variety in poke is abundant.  For my friend, who grew up and moved away from Hawaii, she is very pleased to have it.  I totally get that.</Text>

<user>116350109514665334281<//user><review>Went here when it first opened for the prix fixe menu.  Outdoor seating and people were dressed up.  Wasn't expecting much, but was actually blown away by some of the dishes.

We had the sichuan dumplings, crab fried rice, and the whole fish.  Dumplings and the fried rice are a must get.  Would pass on the whole fish if you're looking for a more elegant night out, since you have to use your hands to really get all the meat from it.</review>< Pictures>

My group had a great time at Lukshon. All the food was well prepared and well plated. Service was attentive and pleasant. For the quality of the food and ambiance, we expected to spend more. With tip, we spent about $125pp which included a cocktail, 8 shared plates, and desserts. A worthy excuse to swing by Culver City!< /text>

<Text>You should give this place a try, especially if you have a modest size group (3-5) people so that everyone can share dishes.

The food is very good, the ambiance is great, service fantastic, drinks very good.

Food is broadly "Asian fusion" and draws from a number of influences. It's like an upscale pine and crane. You've got tea leaf salad, Dan Dan noodles, etc. Of course they have Brussels sprouts, which has replaced avocado toast as the overhyped dish of the moment.

Drinks are varied and tasty. Good scotch selection.

Service is fantastic: friendly, knowledgeable, accommodating, fast, unobtrusive.

Great design and layout. It's just a fun place to be.

Give it a try!< /Text>< pics>

The food was unique. The service was not bad but less than I expected for the cost and for being one of the top restaurants in LA.<//Text>

<review>Some of the best Asian fusion foods. Not sure why it's so underrated compared to other restaurants but the food has character and a lot of flavour. Also, great patio.</review>< Pictures>

First time I went here it was fantastic.  Great food/tasting menu and the experience left us wanting to come back a week later to try the a la carte menu. Tonight the experience with the hostess was so horrible we left without eating. So, one visit was a 5 for 5, tonight would be a negative rating if such a thing is possible. It was such an unpleasant experience tonight I won't be coming back.

Good luck lukshon...you have some opportunity to improve your service but my experience was so negative we won't be making the trip to you again.< /Text>

I came in a party of 7.  My family was interested in their $70 tasting menu and I don't eat pork or beef anymore.  I asked if they can make exception if I can opt out or if they can substitute dishes.  They said sorry everyone has to order the one tasting menu.  That's disappointing that the server wasn't flexible to accommodate non pork and beef patrons.  I came in a large party.  It wasn't two people and one opted out.  I spent over $70 and could only eat a few dishes and of those dishes fish and crab fried rice was great and others were mediocre.  Lukshon was good but definitely not great nor amazing that would come back.  I've been to a few tasting menu restaurants and they offered a vegetarian tasting menu if everyone in party orders the tasting.  Nevermore Lukshon.<//text>

We probably should have eaten less, but couldn't resist trying everything. I REALLY enjoyed the banh mi sandwich, the steak (perfectly cooked) and the chocolate "rocks" dessert. The service was prompt, friendly and professional. We will definitely go back.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

We made reservations a week in advance for 4 to celebrate a birthday.

When we were seated at a table between 2 other parties we asked to be moved to a booth across from our table but we were told they were only for parties of 6. They sat 3 parties of 4 during our meal.

After looking at our menus the server came over and explained the menu and talked us into the pre-fixed menu for the “ full fine dining experience”. After about 15 minutes the server returned to inform us this was now sold out and we would have to order from the regular menu. Even though it was 7:30 pm on a Thursday night?

We then ordered what our server suggested but service was very slow and we asked the server to please bring us something ASAP. A different server brought us a dish of noodles and as I was about to serve he pulled the dish from my hands and said “sorry wrong table”.

We spent over $800.00 but i don’t think this restaurant cared if we were happy or if we would return!

With all the choices we have in Los Angeles I would never go back or recommend this restaurant!<//Review>

Love this place!  The food is amazing. Some of my favorite cocktails ever. Staff is incredible. I love that outdoor patio with the fireplace.  I do wish they were better about taking out the meat for vegetarian customers. The heirloom rice is one of my favorite dishes.</Text>

My new "fancy" place. I just found out they try not to use dairy at all and most of their desserts were dairy-free. Every dish was an experience. The service could be a little... happier? But love the food.< /text>

Overpriced, confused execution of SE Asian food. The chef is arrogant and inflexible and this shines through in all aspects of the food. The service was slow and they were understaffed most likely because of a holiday weekend. I would not go back.</Text>

<review>The Hawaiian Butterfish was fantastic, but the rest of the meal was average. Cold sesame noodles felt odd served by itself, and I've had better soft shell crab at almost any Vietnamese restaurant. The food was good but overpriced for what it was, maybe the meat is better? They had a very limited menu and hardly any vegetarian options. Lovely venue and great staff though.< /review><Rate>3< /Rate><Time>1504935986938<//Time>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I thought this place was fantastic. I went last night so middle of the summer on a Tuesday and it was just wonderful being outside on the terrace by this fantastic weather. A little bit crowded outdoors so I'm glad we had reservations but very chill atmosphere.

The food was delicious. For two people 4-5 dishes are probably fine depending on how much you eat and what you get. The Sichuan dumplings were incredible and the chicken pots were amazing as well so highly recommend both. We also had the halibut which was amazing.

For drinks the Singapore Sling and the Gimlet (with a spicy kick to it) were great and solid summer night drinking decisions.

Definitely recommend this place highly! Oh and for parking go into one of the lots of the furniture companies around there.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

The food was good some of the dishes were absolutely delicious some of them were just good. The service was fairly friendly but not over-the-top. The real stars of the service were the people who pour the water and took your plates.  They were very attentive. The waiter less so.</text>

I came here for an anniversary celebration with my wife who has some serious food sensitivities. We were told that there were four dishes she could eat in the restaurant, one being steamed rice that part way through the meal we were told wasn't actually available. They basically told us, with a kitchen full of cooks and food, that they would make no accommodations for my wife. In this day and age, I feel attitudes like this are unacceptable. The food we did have was great, and the service was amazing, but it is way over priced.< /review>

Lukshon is gorgeous.  A great place for an intimate setting, rather seated inside, or, via the outdoor patio.  All ingredients are fresh and all foods were prepared to perfection.  Definitely a place to visit when in Culver City.<//Review>

<Rating>3</Rating><Review>A few positives about this place. It's interior design is nice and the staff here are top notch. If rating was about service I would rate it 5 stars. However, I cannot understand how the food here is rated so highly. I've eaten at many other places with much tastier foods at half the price. We ordered 8 different items and each was lacking some kind of punch. I kept expecting the next item to be better only to be really disappointed with the food. Its the one and only visit to this place.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

This happened most recently when I tried the lamb. It just melts in your mouth like butter and the flavors...omg you have to try it! The service is always attentive, helpful, and consistent each time I go. The ambiance at night is great for a date. It’s a bit on the pricey side but worth it for the quality of food and service . I come here often because the food is amazing! It tastes fresh with high quality ingredients. I love trying all the dishes on the menu and the new dishes that are added periodically. Just like any restaurant it’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. Give it a try to see if it’s yours. If not I’ll be more than happy to take your seat. Thanks Lukshon for becoming my favorite restaurant <3< /review>< Pics>

Some very nice small plates among our selection, but as a selection - the same base seemed ever present. A little disappointing, but definitely, worth a couple of visits for those with a wallet that can take the pressure. Average service. Modern, slightly clinical look.< /review>

Great food and great atmosphere. This is food like I've never had before. The chef is very creative with his dishes. I've never had brussel sprouts prepared like this. It made me want to have more. (How many times can you say that?)</text>

<Text>Lukshon is a neat Asian fusion restaurant that doesn't completely work taste-wise, especially at the price being shown.  However, still worth a look-see for Asian fusion enthusiasts.

Lukshon is in a bit of a weird location - close to Father's Office but the modern/current vibe of the architecture and the high price seems to contrast a bit harshly with the rest of the locale.  Still, if you can forget about your surroundings, the interior is quite beautiful and the outdoor tables have a nice ceiling of heaters to keep you warm at night.  The service was great with normal check-ups.

Lukshon wasn't too bad and almost does make for a great experience.  Just for the money and the portions, it was so-so.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

The noodles were cold. The lobster roll was served cold between a warm  piece of toast.The Brussels sprouts and Seabass were very good .The food. Came. out at different times.The service was good ..They did it have jack daliels or Bombay sapphires gin..There war no valet parking as advertised..I think if a food is served cold you should know before you order.

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>Let me start by saying two things: 1) I've had szechuan pepper before  multiple times (the 'mouth-watering' kind) and 2) I've eaten at Michelin star restaurants around the world and shacks on the side of the road, which I consider equal if the food is up to snuff. Overall, I rate 5 stars as a perfect experience - 1 star for wait staff, 1 for ambiance, and 3 for food (presentation, taste/texture, and plating). I heard rave reviews of this restaurant and decided to treat my partner to dinner on our vacation. First, the wait staff were fine (1/2 point from me because when we walked in the couple in front of us were asking for a table, waving to the 'tasting tables' and the maitre d' [female] stated that they were for the 'tasting.' The customer did not understand and he asked again and got the same response. Visibly confused the customer accepted the 'no' and sat at the bar with his pair. An easy solution would be to say they were reserved but this was not done smoothly and for that it cost the review a half point). Second, and most importantly, we ordered the 'classics' course menu, each course is itemized for the review: (1) Butterfish - PHENOMENAL, we'll balanced with the bitter green shoots, this dish was well portioned and married flavors brilliantly; (2) Lobster 'Banh mi' - the lobster flavor was lost in the richness of the buttered brioche, also (and I might be picky because my partner is Vietnamese and I just got back from a Xmas dinner where they made fish sauce from scratch) the 'banh mi' was really nonexistent. I was left waiting for that deep flavor from the fish sauce that never came through or fermented veggies to cut the rich butter but that wasn't there either - overall this plate left me wanting; (3) Szechuan dumplings - I ate 1/2 of 1 and was completely turned off by the overpowering Szechuan pepper, it was not just 'there,' it was the ONLY flavor 'there.' In addition, after eating this small bite I began to feel nausea and a headache - this was the worst dish, for sure, and I would never order it again; (4) 'Beef and broccoli' - my biggest critique of this dish is the lack of seasoning. The beef and broccoli were well prepared and plated but the 'coating' [I don't know what else to call it because it wasn't a crust or a sauce] on the beef monopolized the taste of everything - the whole dish just tasted like that coating, which lacked salt, as well. I waited for another complementary flavor with the broccoli  like lemon or a bright element but the broccoli was just grilled, with no flavor at all to highlight the relationship between the crisp broccoli and the savory beef. This dish REQUIRED salt and with the coating taking over the dish I felt that it may do better as a small sauce on the plate or on the side - it was overall bland and moot; (5) soba noodles? - OVERPOWERING szechuan pepper again, infused deeply in the peanut sauce. I took a half of a bite and I almost threw up right then and there (side note: I actually threw up the whole dinner when we got back to the hotel :( 300 dollars down the drain) - enough said about that dish, it was, like the dumplings, monopolized by the pepper and was inedible, for me; (6) chocolate 'rocks' - PERFECT DISH, I wouldn't change anything about the dessert. With a perfect temper on the chocolate coating that married harmoniously with the ice cream inside and the cream sauce on the plate. This was complimented by the crunchy bits on the plate and an absolutely perfect passion fruit jelly, which brought all the flavors together so elegantly I couldn't stop eating this dish! Finally, the ambiance was great, but alas, I must give only 3 stars because of the comments above. Needless to say, my partner ended up paying for the dinner because he frlt bad that I didn't enjoy most of it, his critiques were not as itemized as mine but echoed some of the same as my own. In sum: Order al la carte if it's your first time - you also may want to taste the szechuan sauce before buying those items, you may not like it at all.</text>< Pictures>

The beef and broccoli especially... don't let the name fool you... it is one of the most complex and flavorful dishes I've had in my life. The dandan noodles are fantastic, too.

All of the plates are meant to be shared family style. They recommend two to three plates per person. It was a party of four and we made it work with 8 plates. The best plate over all was the crispy fish which was market price, large and just the right size. Beautifully fried and flaky skin with moist  meat and a great side peanut sauce to accompany it. Second best was the butterfish salad which was very similar to cevice. Lightly spicy and citrus flavors help the cubes of fish stand out.< /text><UserId.>113078237579106015005<//UserId.></record>

<Review>Horrendous service.  Don't bother and go somewhere else.  We were a party of 4 with a reservation at 8:15 last Saturday night.  We arrived on time and were told we'd be seated "shortly."  After a drink and the passage of 35 minutes we inquired about our table and were told "soon."  Long story short:  After a wait of 1 hour and 5 minutes we left for another restaurant.  The hostess was completely unrepentant.  Didn't check up on us; never offered anything (i.e., a drink, an apology) for our inconvenience.  I asked to see the manager several times -- a Ms. Pesce, I'm told -- and was informed that she was too busy to come out of the back.  We weren't alone.  When we left, the hostess was dealing with another party who also had a 8:15 reservation.  Have been here before, but never again.  The food isn't that good to warrant the aggravation.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I seldom give a five stars, but Lukshon deserves that rating. The room is extraordinary, sleek, modern, comfortable and efficient. The staff is professional AND friendly. That alone is a rarity in upscale restaurants for some mysterious reason.

The menu is of a reasonable scale. We started with a nice cabbage salad that was followed by  cold Hawiian butterfish and a lobster bahn mi. The butterfish was excellent, the bahn mi is just okay, but the least successful dish or party tasted. The star dish was the Chrispy Whole Fried Fish. Nicely prepared and served. The desserts are extraordonary.</Text>

< Review>
LUKSHON RESTAURANT LA: JOKE!!!The restaurants Chief refused to accomodate a patrons request to simply place the sauce on the side like most restaurants in this country. Even more dishearting, I let the waiter know that I am allergic to oils and certain ingredients, that is why I ordered the steamed fish and vegetables. My husband ordered the Lobster roll. WHAT A JOKE! It was more like a minced raw onion sandwich. We will never go back!! The Chief should be fired!!<//Review>

<text>When I first looked at the menu, I thought, why is this place $$$? These prices are normal! Then I ate there and understood why each person could easily spend $$$ for their fill.

Nevertheless, the food is delicious. I came here with my friend for DineLA week, and per the usual routine ordered off the DineLA menu and then some, but shared every single dish. It's just the right thing to do, despite what Joey says.

The watermelon salad with nuoc cham (a citrusy spicy sort of fish sauce - really wakes up the taste buds!) was really fresh. It made me appreciate how much better food is while in season - huge cubes of watermelon, microgreens, and the poached shrimp was a great addition.

Next came the spicy chicken pops - disappointing because they weren't spicy at all. Chicken was hot and tender though! I should also mention the soft shell crab here briefly - tempura fried perfectly with a really soft steamed bun, but nothing that was especially exciting. When we asked for a spicy sauce on the side, they gave us a blend of smoked chili peppers, but still more smoky than spicy.

The chiang mai curry noodles were definitely the star of the entrees, excluding dessert. I love curry noodle soup so this dish was a hit for me. Surprisingly spicy (questioning why the chicken pops weren't) and very savory, it was a great bowl of curry noodles for a one-man dinner!

Now for the real star of the dinner: the thai tea sundae. the scoop of thai tea flavored ice cream was so delicious, and everything that surrounded it was equally exciting. There were green citrus sauces, whipped coconut,  a caramel sauce with an interesting dark spice note to it. The whole dessert just came together like not other. If this were still offered on the regular menu, I would come back just for that.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2b98253f81f7b:0x984bac857fbd77c7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This restaurant is billed as LA’s newest IT place. I showed up on on a sunny, pleasant early Saturday evening. The streets of Culver City were absurdly empty. I even found a *free* parking spot immediately.

We were seated at a communal table, weird because there were several empty tables in the seating area.

There are five seating areas: one outdoor, rest indoors: an area with booths, a ‘communal’ area with two large 8 seater tables, a row of 10 stools by the bar, and six stools that overlook the kitchen, for those who want to look at the proles that cook your food. Total capacity about 100 seats.

Service was efficient. The menus arrived quickly. No free bread. The waiter told us that it is typically 3 small plates person, which comes out to $30 per person. Many items on the menu looked good, and we ordered the Hawaiian Butterfish (15), Lobster Roll Banh Mi (17), Not Chinese Chicken Salad (13), Sichuan Dumplings (13), Brussels Sprouts (9), Spicy Chicken Pops (14), Crispy Rice Cakes (12), Heirloom Black Rice (13).

For drinks we ordered the Singapore Sling (14) and the Hot & Sour Gimlet (13). As a second act I ordered the black lager coedo “shikkoku” dark beer (9)

For dessert we had the Warm Banana Toffee Cake(10), Warm Donuts (10) and the Coconut Dark Chocolate Rocks (11)

I am going to save you a lot of time and tell you what to do. You go here, order the Hawaiian Butterfish, the Heirloom Black Rice, the Coconut Dark Chocolate Rocks and the dark beer. Skip the rest.

The Hawaiian Butterfish is a salad. It looked amazing. As the first dish that came out, with a bit of the Gimlet in me, it looked so good. It tasted great. Great presentation. I had never eaten such firm fish flesh before, and was beguiled. What was this? I must find out.

Now, I had never heard of Butterfish before, and knew it was a marketing term. So I asked them what fish it was. They first came back with Escolar. I was like, come on. Escolar is a catch-all term for a group of fish. Exactly what fish is it? More conferring, they said it was ‘walu’.

A little Google work yielded some funny results. Walu is known as the ‘poop fish’ or the ‘ex-lax fish’. Apparently the fish cannot digest fat and so its flesh is mostly fat. And if you eat more than 6 oz of it, you will experience some uncomfortable sensations as well. Go look it up.

But eat it! It tastes divine. Just. Not. Too. Much.

The Lobster Roll was so-so. The Not Chinese Chicken Salad was terrible. The Sichuan Dumplings, well let’s just say that they are not from Sichuan, the Sichuan sauce was meh, and they are more like micro-Dumplings. The Brussels Sprouts were OK, the 6 year old in our group ate all of them. The Crispy Rice Cakes were terrible.

The use of "Shelton Farms Drummettes” as a marketing term for selling the ‘Spicy Chicken Pops” is weird. Being in LA we don’t know of Shelton Farms, so in our money-addled status-grubby minds it conjures up visions of a bucolic farm where everything is organic, cows are milked by milkmaids, pigs speak prose and the chicken pecks away until the ax comes down. But Shelton Farms, as far as I could find in Google, is just some corner market in Michigan of all places. So did my chicken come frozen from 1,500 miles away?

There was nothing spicy about the Spicy Chicken Pops. Miniscule pieces of ‘chicken’ drowned in a sugary sauce.

The Heirloom Black Rice was delicious. I’d love to incorporate that into my regular eating schedule.

I saw a fried fish going out of the kitchen, a whole fried fish bent in half. Waiter said it was $45. What fish is it? He said branzino. Branzino? Deep fried? For $45? That’s insane. By my calculations, wholesale cost is $8.00 per lb, they are doing a 5x multiplier. Ripoff.

I was underwhelmed by this place. Other than two dishes, one dessert, and a beer, it was overpriced, overflavored food. The bill took my breath away.

So if you must go here, eat the Butterfish, the Heirloom Black Rice, drink the dark beer, eat the Rocks for dessert, and get out. Better yet, don't go.< /Review>

<Text>My sales person was Joey and he was very polite and knowledgeable. He helped walk me through setting up my new phone, unfortunately my old phone keep dying while trying to transfer my data. I was eventually able to use my cloud backup.
In all it was a very low pressure sale.
I do wish that they had more selection for case's and fast charging power adapters.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Verizon itself has no say as to anything that happens in this store and cant help I found out the hard way. I was sold a worthless Samsung A21 that is the slowest phone ever doesn't charge wirelessly. Doesn't have Samsung smart things to control all my home automation. Bluetooth wont stay connected to anything. Camera wont scan barcodes for restaurant menus had to download an app.  Constantly needs to be reset. i wasn't shown any other models or options was just told this will be perfect for you. (WRONG) Fees for this phone were thru the roof. I tried to cancel in the middle of this purchase because it just didn't feel right and was meet with scowls and the threat of $35 restocking fee.  it took me more then the 14 days return policy to realize this phone didn't do anything i needed it too because i was on vacation. And now I'm stuck with a phone that's useless for me.
if you need a new phone call Verizon directly and get a nice phone at a decent price without any of the add on hidden fees.
This is what actual Verizon rep told me over the phone and what i tried to do in store but wasn't allowed to back out of the purchase.

I am a 22 year plus Verizon customer and cant believe i was treated this way. I am now forced to switch services after 22 years just to get a free phone from another provider because I'm now being forced to pay for this useless phone that i will never use. Thanks ALOT....(Anything for a sale) I get it shame on me.<//Review>< pictures>

Took my elderly mother into this store and was helped by Ryan who did not normally work at this at this location. I’ve been in many cell phone stores in my time.   NEVER HAVE I BEEN SO HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE!

He was absolutely wonderful.  Phone switch was  done perfectly.  No hiccups with the transfer of photos and such.   I just wish every time you went to a store and received this level of service and helpfulness.  Whole process less than 30 minutes.

The most important part?  My elderly mother who doesn’t do change well, left with a smile and not stressed out.

Verizon needs to use him as an example for training.

Bravo sir!<//Review>

<Text>Went in to get a phone upgrade. Due to COVID-19 you have to check-in with your phone which wasn’t a problem, just made it a bit uncomfortable since no one says hi when you walk in and if it wasn’t for my husband I would of missed the sign that said to check in. After about an hour, we decided to just walk in and sit at the table, that was when an associate came to say hi and asked what we needed help with.
They were busy when we got there which was fine, we had no problem waiting, and the staff was very friendly. The check in process is pointless since I never got any notifications besides when I signed up.
Overall, Jack was helpful and got me set up with my new phone. I would go back if I needed any additional help although I would just skip the check in process since it’s useless.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x809b21ed9c4f448d:0x5cc496d8731d8558< /gmapID></record>

I am not someone who writes reviews in general, let alone bad ones, but please do not go to this location. Please go to a store that is not an Authorized Retailer. The amount of work my boyfriend and I have had to do to get our account correct is insane. I have been on the phone with customer service this past 3 weeks for over 10 hours in total. My boyfriend and I recently switched carriers to Verizon from Sprint and AT&T. Osha, one of the managers at this store, gave us a ton of false information and promises that haven't been met and won't be met. She told us that we could get a BOGO deal from Verizon and could choose any unlimited plan we wanted to receive this deal. Turned out, you had to have the Get Unlimited plan to get the BOGO deal. She told us that we would get our activation fees returned to us after our discount was processed. Customer service told me that activation fees don't get waived for any discounts. She told us how much our bill would be each month and our monthly bill will not even be close to this amount. Having to call customer service multiple times and trying to fix this huge mess, has left a very bad taste in our mouths about Verizon. Please go to the actual Verizon store if you want factual information about what you're signing up for.<//text>

< Review>
I brought my 76 year old mother in here today to update her iphone from circa 2003.  She is not tech savvy.... and didn’t know or remember any of her passwords or pin numbers.  Jack worked with us, very patiently... with kindness and professionalism.  He worked tirelessly for over an hour, solving the passcode mysteries surrounding our case.  As we were leaving, another customer came in.  Jack greeted him very nicely... and the man began explaining his crisis while Jack listened, and began to help.  I had to laugh as I walked out:  Verizon employees are like therapists dealing with a myriad of people, personalities, ages and temperaments.  I hope they are paid well... because they DEFINITELY deserve it.  After what Jack went through today, the guy deserves a six pack and a raise....<//Review>

<Review>Emily was so amazing and helpful! I came in switching from sprint or (tmobile) now and it was night and day with the customer service, the actual products and the service verizon gives you! Even though emily had told me she had just started working there, I wouldn’t have even known if she didn’t say anything. I wanted the iPhone 12 pro and they didn’t have it in the black color, so one of the other associates went to another store and got the phone for me! overall an amazing experience, so happy to be with verizon now!<//Review><UserId.>111897468215990286926< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

The young lady and gentleman that helped my grandpa and I get new phones were amazing! I was very impressed with their customer service and how dedicated they were to making us happy. Very very pleased with them overall!!! They transferred our old phones to our new phones exactly how it was before I didn’t have to do a single thing all my apps and pictures and contacts were all there. I could not be happier with this place. I will be going back next time anyone on our family plan needs an upgrade.< /Text>

Don’t buy anything here! They have a 14 day policy they don’t actually follow. Manager is extremely rude and unprofessional. I wouldn’t waste your time here. The corporate store by the Galleria is worth your time and money.<//Review>

I have recieved great customer service at this location  from both Dacey C. and Donia. Dacey helped me replace my iphone that was damaged then gave me a great deal on a watch that i have been wanting. Plus she went above and beyond to guide me through all  the technical details.
Bottom line is i noticed they are there every time ready to help you if you buy something or not. They absolutely listen to you, are friendly and very knowledgable about their products. Now thats professional service! ...Im great< /Review>

Came in today wanting a Pixel 2 XL with a data plan that worked best for my budget. Isaiah, the manager, is by far the coolest, most professional rep around - Verizon should be proud to have him running that store. Got the pixel on a great deal, and in addition I was given a wonderful data plan that worked great for my work, and for my budget. I will absolutely return here, if the need ever arises. Highly recommend this retailer.<//Review>

Our brand new  iPhone 10  we traded in has mysteriously disappeared ( Obviously the staff at this store STOLE our phone) and Roseville police is being made aware of this stores CRIMINAL practices. They will say something is "Free" and then charge you $65.00 for that "Free" item. BEWARE: THESE GUYS ARE CRIMINALS!!

On 9/30/2019 i requested a refund and the saleperson was very RUDE. We even got into an argument ( so much for the customer is always right). We were told our refund check for the iPhone we traded in would be mailed to us. However nearly a month later NOTHING. We called Verizon corporate office today to find out absolutely no paperwork had been processed concerning our refund and my iPhone 10 was no where to be found. My wife called Victra today 10 times ( I am not kidding ) for the stores location CODE  and the young lady would not answer the phone after hanging up with my wife ( i literally had to drive to the location to get it and there were ZERO customers in the store yet the young lady stated she was "swamped with customers" ( one of many lies this store uses). Luckily Victra corporate office ( Harriett Little ) was EXTREMELY helpful and professional and she processed our refund nearly a month later despite not receiving any paperwork from this store. We went with T-mobile up the street in Roseville, they are no pressure, laid back and no surprises. In my entire life i have NEVER once wrote a bad review on the internet, but when my wife has to spend two hours on the phone after getting the run-around from this location, i feel its imperative management learns the meaning of CUSTOMER SERVICE.< /text><user_id>112227932139371626130<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

The gal working this afternoon was worthless.  She told me to get the tech app and they would help me.  The tech app person told me the girl at the store should have called Customer Care for me and handled my issue which could not be handled with the tech app.  She doesn’t even deserve one star - very poor customer service!</Review>

All the time that I have gone the store, I’ve had a great service. But lately service has gone down hill. I came at 959 am and waited until 1005 am no one was in the store. When I called and mentioned it I was brushed off saying I was here. But my call log on my phone say 1002. Why agrue with me... point is service is not great. Almost done only is Steve is the reason I stay.< /Review>

I didn't end up getting anything at this location. I went in to see if they sold a battery for my phone and browse the new releases. Less than 30 seconds after I walked in the store with my mom (who wanted to look at the new phones too) a sales associate greeted us and asked us if we needed help with anything. I asked about the battery and he informed me I would have to go to a Battery store if I wanted to get one. Another associate off to the side did offer the mobile recharging devices. Since that wasn't what I was looking for I declined the offer. The first associate was still standing right in front of us, and since I didn't want to buy anything right away there was a very awkward atmosphere. We left without looking at any of the phones. Maybe let people look around for a minute before approaching them.<//text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>I bought 2 iPhones during the March BOGO offer. The conditions of the offer were such that I would have to buy both iphones up front then have the value of one of the iphones credited to my bill in ~3 months. This means that about $700 should have been credited to my bill in June. Come August, I still had not received my credit and called the Verizon store to see what happened, they gave me the run­around for a week and bounced me from person to person. Finally informed me that there was an error on their end and as a result I was not eligible for the BOGO offer. I have all of the paperwork as well as a signed contract saying that I qualified for the BOGO offer when I walked out the door in March when I bought the phones, it is not my fault that they incorrectly inputted information on their end and cost me my qualification for BOGO. My contract and paperwork clearly states that I will receive the credit for the second iPhone in 3 months from date of purchase as well as the reduced monthly fee thereafter. I deserve to have my account credited for the value of the iphone since we have a signed contract stating that I met the terms and conditions when I purchased. I called the store and requested to speak to a manager multiple times and was abruptly blocked or hung up on. Nobody communicated with me regarding their error nor is anyone from the store willing to rectify their mistakes. The district manager was supposed to call me on multiple occasions and never has, even when I go in the store I am ignored. I am extremely unsatisfied with how they are handling their mistake and expecting me to give up on getting my $700 by ignoring my phone calls.<//Text>< pictures>

Very uninformative. they allowed me to have already paid my bill for the month then they suggested that i change my plan to something more affordable but changed my plan in the middle of the month instead of waiting til the end of the month so i had to pay a pro-rated amount. basically getting charged double. i feel i was taken advantage of and will not be returning to that store. i will only go to proper Verizon stores from now on. very disappointed.< /text>< pictures>

Went in for a question about my bill since adding a line. The store manager didn't know the answer and so he called and had us leave a message with customer service to call us back. As we waited he kept trying to persuade me to trade in my phone for an upgrade. I initially was told I would only get $75 for my trade in so I told him I'd have to think about it. After customer service called me back he showed me he found a special in his binder that expired that day for $250 for trade in and so I agreed. He then told me that my new phone (The Note 8) didn't come with accessories and showed me choices for charging cords or wireless charger and asked me which case I wanted.  When I came back to pick up the phone he gave me a bag with my boxes and said he threw in some earplugs. (I thought these items were included for upgrading since my "new phone didn't come with").  I  got my first bill a week later and didn't see my $250 credit. I went back to my bag for my receipt and see that the $250 credit was applied to the crap in the bag! Then I see the false bottom in the Note 8 phone box which contained a cube, charging cord earplugs etc. I didn't need the crap in the bag at all. I  talked to store manager today and he tells me the $250 was "so you wouldn't have
any out of pocket costs "! The $250 was to cover the sales tax on my new phone (roughly $72) and the rest is IN STORE CREDIT for a "bundle package " I would never have consented to buy.  So at the end of the day I paid full price for my new phone, gave up my just paid off Glalaxy 5 and got a bag  of crap I do not need or want! I  feel like I  was conned. I would have never given up my Note 5 for a bag of crap. I would rather have given the phone to my daughter.  Come to find out this store is not a tru Verizon store but an authorized seller (Victra). Beware! Use caution when told you are getting $x off for your trade in on a new phone. You too may just end up with a bag of crap accessories that you dont need instead!</Review>

THIS IS NOT A REAL VERIZON STORE! BEWARE!This store is a total scam and full of manipulating, lying employees just looking to take advantage of anyone who walks in the door. They will push unnessessary products on you and will also try to sell you their "VIP" service which they try to imply is necessary to upgrade/buy a phone from them when it is not.

When confronted on their bad business practices, the new manager had a huge ego, was very defensive and just kept repeating how they sell more at their store than a real corporate Verizon store and how I was making a mistake. I could care less what they sell. When returning all of the stuff I bought there, I felt bullied by the manager and had to stand firm on my position of why I did not want any of their products anymore and how I would be returning my phone. Not only that, they had a promotion for a free tablet which they said would only cost me $10/month. Well, getting my first bill and it's actually $29/month. Another huge disappointment but now it's past the 14 day return policy so I'm stuck with it.

If you buy any products at this store you can't take your products to just any Verizon store, it must be one of their stores. Reality is, this store is a scam with a bunch of scammers working in it. BEWARE! They WILL take advantage of you!<//Review>

BEWARE OF SCAMMING MANAGER ERIC REBELO!!
I went into the store at around 9:40am on Friday July 7th wanting to upgrade to a new phone for my birthday (came in on my birthday). Their was one male already taking care of another customer so I waited my turn. It took a very long time since the couple were getting two new phones set up, after an hour of waiting the manger finally comes out of the back room to help me (not sure why he made me wait an hour, when he was their the whole time). Anyways, I let him know that I wanted to upgrade to an iPhone 7 plus and that I wanted to do the monthly bill of paying it off instead of paying right away. He said okay and then proceeded to tell me about their "STARTER PACKS" and what they come with. I informed him that I didn't want any of the items in the starter pack, that I had my own items (such as a case, screen protector, etc.) He then said you HAVE to purchase a STARTER PACK, and that I could at least get the small starter pack which is $221!!! I then informed him again that I don't need any of the items in the STARTER PACK and I asked him if their was any other option. He THEN proceeded to say that their was no other option. I couldn't believe it so I kept asking if this was a new setup of theirs because I know I didn't have to do this with my other phone. He just shrugged his shoulders and said 'noo...' I ended up leaving the store because he said their was no other option except buying the start pack when you buy the phone. I went home and I just couldn't believe that this was the actual system and so I went online to their website and I found out you didn't need to buy this start pack at all and that it was just an option they give you. I wanted to double check so I called a different Verizon store and they verified. I then wasted my gas by having to return to the store. I let the sales guy (not manager) help me out this time and I just made sure to tell them what I wanted and that my total should be this amount after they were done. The sales guy was nice and helped me out.
I will NEVER be returning to this Verizon store because of this scamming guy, Eric, trying to get extra money and completely lieing to the customers face. HEAD OVER TO A DIFFERENT VERIZON STORE.<//Text>

<text>Only 3 bays, but quick an friendly service. Well staffed and always feel like the customer is king. This shop is legit and will not do unnecessary work unless requested. Never talks down to the customer. Explains everything rationally,  and treats them RIGHT. I would recommend my elderly mother to come here. I got starters, radiatora, brakes, and even an engine repaired here with zero drama for last 2 years. In the late afternoon quick oil change minor repair. The Best in LA!<//text>< pictures>

They are the most honest mechanics I have ever met.  I come with a problem and he tries to save me money as much as possible.  Whereas, other mechanics will try to scare me problems that doesn’t exist.  I am so glad I found this place< /text>

Really great place for any car issues; went around 7:30 am because I thought that's when they opened up. Someone was there, but the actual mechanic that was able to work on my car, didn't arrive til 8 am.

My car was making a rattling noise and it turns out it was the timing belt. I drive a Ford Escape [mini SUV] and I thought for sure would be more than $120. That also included an oil change. All this completed within an hour. Of course, you have to be there first because there was a line when I left.

I definitely plan to return, next time that I need to.  Thanks Harvard Auto Repair for being honest, friendly and quick!<//text>

Very honest people and they even discounted part price. When I visited the shop, They have two signs from Yelp saying people love your shop in 2016 and 2017, which tell itself how good the service they provide around the community. Thank you. Mr. Cho</Text>

(Translated by Google) Every time I hit the brakes, I heard a noise. I went to the nearest Korean repair shop, and the boss was kind and the work was finished quickly. It is more expensive than Korea, but I changed my Dotima's brake pads at an affordable price. Sounds no longer produced. Great garage.

내가 브레이크를 밟을 때마다 노이즈가 들렸다. 한인 정비소 중에 가까운 곳으로 갔고 사장님 친절하시고 작업도 금방 끝났다. 한국보다는 비싸지만 부담스럽지 않은 가격으로 내 도티마의 브레이크 패드를 갈아주었다. 더이상 나지 않는 소리. 훌륭한 정비소.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I don't know much about the car, but when I asked 3~4 questions, the boss really kindly informed me and the oil change was replaced with a good one, so it was great. Best recommended! 👍👍👍

(Translated by Google) The owner has very bad perception of Koreans.

Too unkind and very bad attitude to guests

The owner's attitude is so disappointing that I wonder if I will treat foreign people like this.

Never again! It's a body shop you don't want to go to Never!!

My head is right now ㅠ

주인이 한국사람에 대한 인식이 아주안좋다

너무 불친절하고 손님에 대한 태도가 아주 나쁨

외국 사람들 한테도 이렇게 함부로 대할까 싶은 생각이 들정도로 주인의 태도가 아주 실망스러움

다시는!절때로!! 가고싶지않은 바디샵이다  Never!!

(Translated by Google) The owner changes and is a mess.
Relying on Hispanic employees who do not have the expertise to do so, the employee must either change a decent brake pad or change the tires that are still there ... The brake pads were no problem with 6000 more miles after that, It's still okay.
I have been traveling for over 15 years since I was a former owner, and I have introduced a lot of people. It is a place where you should never go.

주인 바뀌고 엉망진창 입니다.
전문지식이 없어서 일하는 히스패닉 직원에만 의존하고 직원은 아직 괜찮은 브레이크 패드를 갈아야 한다고 하거나 멀쩡한 타이어를 갈아야 한다고...브레이크 패드는 그후로 6000마일을 더 타고 갈아도 문제가 없었고 타이어는 5개월을 더 타고 다녀도 아직도 괜찮습니다.
전주인이 있을때부터 15년 이상을 다니고 정말 많은 사람들을 소개해줬는데 주인이 바뀌고나서 완전히 나쁜 정비소가 되었네요. 절대로 가서는 안되는 곳입니다.</Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) In the nearest maintenance, the AC clutch, compressor and relay are all in the worst case, and I have to change it for $ 500, so I came here because I did not want it. I am a Hispanic employee and I am Nabal and I am well prepared. I wanted to end up here because I really appreciate it very much but it is broken again after 3 hours; The next day I went to another Kims repair shop and fixed it to $ 30 cleanly. The fundamental problem was the compressor fuse blowing out and the compressor error of the car's own computer ... This is gas sand and it makes the compressor for a while and it costs $ 80.

가까이있는 제일정비에서  AC클러치, 컴프레셔, 릴레이 다안돈다고 최악의경우 갈아야한다고 500불 나온다고 해서 이건아니다 싶어서 여기로 왔는데 그냥 에어컨 refrigerant 가 샌다고 1시간도 안되서 고침. 히스페닉 직원이고 나발이고 잘고치면 장땡. 난 여기가 정말 너무 고맙다 ㅜㅜ  다고 끝내고 싶었으나 3시간 뒤에 다시 고장;;  다음날 다른 김스정비소 가서 고쳤더니 30불에 말끔하게 고침. 근본적인 문제는 컴프레셔 퓨즈나간것과 차 자체 컴퓨터의 컴프레셔 에러였는데... 여긴 가스샌다고만하고 잠시컴프레셔 돌게 만들고 80불 받음 ㅡㅡ</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Do not go this place

they will charge you hidden fees and extra charge without notice.

Also they dont have enough skill to fix your car.

I made a lot of money and fixed the same part of my car three times.
Once I get it, I take money every time I take it ... The boss is not really good.

Never go

돈 엄청 밝히고 내 차 똑같은 부위 3번 고치는데 (고쳤다는데 계속 고장남 ㅡㅡ)
일단 가져오래서 가져갈때마다 돈 받아 쳐먹음... 사장도 진짜 별로임 주변에도 절대 추천 안함.

Your basic ice cream shop. It used to be a 31 flavors but now it's changed hands. Pretty easy to find on hwy. 50, next door to Freshes, and in that little mall. It's also close to Safeway just down the highway. The ice cream is decent, but it is not Häagen-Dazs.< /review>

Delicious!! Got ice cream here and then walked down the road to this view!! It’s right across the street from Lake Tahoe and a bike trail. My husband got a chocolate covered banana and loved it and I got one scoop waffle cone ice cream. We will definitely be back!< /Review>

<review>The location is very nice, across the way from the lake. But the ice cream is not particularly tasty... It tastes quite "watery". Also we had to wait 5-10min to get our cups of ice cream and the lady who served us wasn't really nice. Personally, I wouldn't go again.<//review>< Pics>

I asked (politely) if the had forgotten my order. They were pretty doooshy about my ask. I even gave them a 15% tip. Derrrrr... I felt duped. They are the only game next to the lake. Drive by, most any of the others are just as good. But hey if you want to get ripped off, dig in.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>This place is a total gem. There's a large assortment of ice cream flavors..my personal fav is the mint chip with a house-made waffle cone. Service is prompt and friendly + there's a bunch of rad local art hanging up, which really adds to the overall vibe. 13/10 would recommend!<//review><name>Kait Mars</name>< Response>

Both were great, but the vegan rolled ice cream was awesome, one of the best vegan desserts we've had! They were very friendly even though we came in right at the end of the day and they even showed us how they made the rolled ice cream.

Ice cream was average but still a good spot for a scoop or two. I thought the salted caramel ice cream was very sweet but the coconut was tasty.<//review>

<Response>{'time': 1563516613308, 'text': "You ordered a custom banana split and left without paying because you told my employee we were putting too much ice cream in it. It calls for three scoops. If you didn't want something that big you shouldn't order it. You ran out the front door and got into your $70k car and tried to leave without paying.

<Time>1563503895852</Time><Text>Had a bad experience I really liked this place in the past ,recently visited in July 2019 and the experience was horrible probably the worst customer service I’ve seen in a very very long time. Buyer beware you will have to pay for your order even if it is made incorrectly, the ice cream never left the shop and he charged after us when we didn’t want the order because it was made not how we wanted! So we just left the store because why would we want to pay for a item that we don’t even want? He ran out to the car screaming and we gave him $10 just so he would go away! I was terrified!</Text>< name>

<name>melissa wong< /name><Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Locally made ice cream and treats across the street from the lake. The ice cream is pretty good and made from a local creamerie however it can be a little bit pricey. It is worth the trip if you are craving a cone and you can go right across the street with your cones/treats and enjoy the beach and the Lake. They also have a few bakery/pastry items on occasion too.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Not impressed at all. A tiny kids size scoop was more than I would pay for a double scoop at most shops I go to. The inside has a dingy, dated feel to it, but mostly I'm just annoyed that I paid more for an afternoon snack for my kids than I would have paid for a full dinner. My wife and I even went without so we could save a little cash.</Review>

I couldn’t say more about how positive my experience at this store was, and how helpful the store manager, Dominic was. I came in to the store with a totally smashed phone. It hadn’t  been a good day and the phone was the last straw. Dominic’s calm and friendly presence and excellent costumer service eased my anxiety. He was able to talk me through the various options and made sure I had everything on the new phone set up before leaving the store. I can’t say enough how Impressed i was with the experience that I’ll drive out of the way to go to his t-mobile, if I have any other issues in the future. thank you Dominic!!< /Text>

They charged us additional money to move our phone numbers, and didn't even change the phone numbers for us. We found out that they weren't supposed to charge additional money to move numbers and they have closed now, so we can't even get our original numbers. We lowkey got scammed and when they re-open, I highly recommend you DON'T go to them. Very shady.< /Text>

This new store opened up just a block away from my home and i decided to stop by to see what kind of deals they had. To my surprise I walked in to a very happy store. Everyone is very helpful they answer all my questions with no hesitation. I loved how honest they were. Jason helped me get a new phone and a great deal. Thank you<//Review>

Absolutely fantastic!!!! I'm actually happy with my cell phone carrier for the first time, since cell phones came out!!! Jason has been more than helpful, answering all my questions, when I converted from Android to Apple, making the switch has been seamless! I also enjoy how easy everything is, from payment to upgrades, and everything in between!!!! Thanks Jason</review>

Came here to change my carrier to sprint. My phone bill was starting to get expensive. It was about time for me to change.  Jason was very helpful with my transition and answered with all my questions. I am very satisfied with my new iPhone XS Max</text>

The store helped me get some great deals and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. They will help you and go the extra mile. They helped me get off my horrible plan in Verizon that was just too expensive.<//review>

David, the store representative went above and beyond to help me and my family members transfer information that another store couldn't transfer for us since we did the transaction online. I am glad that sprint has David as part of their team and I feel that sprint needs to be more careful with people who they hire. Companies should be looking for people like David.< /Text>

The sprint store in Torrance helped me with fixing my account, apparently corporate store had add things into my account without me knowing. I really recommend going to this sprint store in Torrance. Thanks guys!<//Text>

I was having issues activating a new galaxy phone and support said I just needed a new SIM card from any Sprint store. I went to a sprint store who just lied to me about my phone, insisting it was a T-Mobile device (it's not). I left the store and searched another sprint store around me and came across this new sprint store so i gave it another shot. This store was awesome and quickly provided the correct SIM card and was activated within minutes! Highly suggest this store.< /text>

Jason gave me an awesome service today. Came in because my sim card wasn't working on my Note 5 phone and he ended up noticing that there was a problem with my bill and had me call corporate to fix it. Long story short due to his attention to detail I was able to walk out with a brand new Note 9. Thanks Jason</Review>

I was hesitant to change to Sprint because I was with AT&T. Since all my family have Sprint I decided to check it out. Once inside, this gentlemen named Franciaso was a HUGE help! By far one of the nicest manager I've met, and quite funny as well. I caved in and he helped me change to Sprint. This store really have some amazing employees! I didn't think Sprint could beat deals from AT&T but yep, they did.</Text>

<text>INSANE! so yeah don't get the LG G8 phone and don't use Sprint! They lied to me and left me hanging. Not only was i lied to when i bought the phone but the 30 day no questions asked return policy is a shame too, because it doesnt take into consideration the lies i was told.......because i trusted them and believed what they told me and i signed the contract.  The manager literally said, "well u signed the contract bro". CRAZY! LG G8 Phone broke first day. Its covered front and back with glass that by the way no place i found will fix it including sprint. The only fix is to go through insurance and buy a replacement phone approx $240ish. Plus keep in mind i pay 15 bucks a month for insurance that i was told when i got the phone that if it broke it would cost 30 bucks to replace the screen. Doesn't stop there. I was told on 2 separate occasions that they would send me a $250  gift card to replace the phone they said they would fix, but now they cant. Never got anything and when i call they say they have no record of ANY giftcards. WHAT? Braking the phone happens and i get that, but being lied to about what happens when i do brake it and then basically tell me "oh well" is just not good business. Run away if you can or its a 2 year nightmare for you....... Disappointing!<//text>< user_id>

Don’t come to this store when they have you waiting just so they can tell you that their registers are closed get the f*** out of here what’s the point in keeping business if you close early then what time is meant for you to close! If I wanted to come and buy 5 family phone plans and all I had was cash this is not the place to do business!</text>

Blessed Sacrament Church is a Church that always want to go, till this Sunday my wish came true! Working nearby, made possible to go there! Beautiful Church even with outdoor service ! The usher were so gentle and efficient they even offer us bottled waters! The Holy Mass so Holy and spiritual Father Ike's homily was so touchy , expressive and actual  so full of God's love hope and forgiveness for all who want to hear his voice! Hevenly experience!<//Text>

<user_name>PSA 3RD<//user_name><Text>Although I have not been inside this venerable church I have passed by it many times, mostly in my younger days. I see the exterior is only a foretaste of the magnificent interior. Bravo to the Parish for not having caused this beautiful work of Catholic art to endure a "wreck-o-vation" by stripping it of it's essentially Catholic elements. Use your altar rail, pulpit and organ that you are blessed to have🙏.
Those elements should engage you more than any singing or preaching by any one individual.. Mass is about worshipping God not coming to "get" something other than salvation out of the experience🙏< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Blessed Sacrament's daily midday mass is truly a Godsend. The smaller side chapel area feels very intimate and especially sacred. Father's homily today was exactly what I needed to hear: live, like John the Baptist, perpetually in faith & not fear. 💜 Blessed be.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate><UserId.>102919721689314493971</UserId.>< Pics>

My grandparents were married here in 1932. It was the parish church for many old time Catholic movie stars and industry employees. It's a beautiful church, and an historic gem, with memories for so many.</Review>

A old church located on the Sunset Boulevard. The interior is very beautiful and specially the Sunday mass choir is the best when it comes to singing and playing music. Love the Rev Fr. Sermons and the other South African priests sermon as well. A beautiful church that everyone should visit.</Review>

< Review>
This is a beautiful, very diverse and open church led by a Parish Life Director who understands and embraces a multicultural community.  I've been an active participant in this church for close to two decades and always feel spiritually uplifted and intellectually challenged. The Jesuit influence is felt throughout.  And, the music is inspiring.</Review>

<date>1543967499724</date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>Even if it's building looks great as architectural heritage, it's name is incorrect! Nothing blessed in refusing to help my relative when we asked for help (I was translator, so we went there together) They proclaiming themselves "blessed" but in reality they do wide variety of sins! They lie people including me and my family member, they refused to help us, and spoke with us in very rude tone. They pretend that help people volunteering and "by the soul, without expectation of getting anything for what they do" Then one of them told me that when person does something good, it counts as a points for life in heaven after this life on earth. Ha, they believe in points for eternal life in heaven. But all they can offer is to give expired canned food, and they didn't think that can offend normal people by offering them such as if we were poor! I'm professional in cooking and I earn enough to buy food for me & my family. I don't eat canned food. We are normal people honest taxpayers and not in needs. We only needed one-time help with paying for public storage because I had tripled overdraft on credit card on due day to pay for public storage unit. So we asked for help to pay  it because someone recommended to ask this church about. I thought that churches created to help people but this one is definitely not! They only wish to collect donations and give nothing useful to people! They offended me by offering expired cans instead of help to pay for storage unit. I'm not poor. They should not look at everyone as at poor, they should learn to listen what people say instead of forcing them to take trash food and go! And they call themselves "blessed" after all! They are unfriendly, dishonest and don't want understand others and don't want to listen! It was much better to close this organization and give the building to some museum or gallery. This organization doesn’t deserve such nice building.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
Some priests are actually doing a life's work of calling.
However, there is one (or at least used to be) mike Mandala... He was aproached in several occasions to intervene in the needs of the population.  He was asked to mediate between members of the congregation and a former music director Roger guerrero whom got rid of people whom he disliked and were there to accomplish and volunteer services.
After the death of a true servant and member of the church for decades whom volunteered to assist many parishioners. Several people approached mike Mandala to assist in funeral arrangements for the parishioners and volunteers to aid one of their own. Mike Mandala sent them away to fly a kite by saying that he wasn't there to help. But yet every Sunday he was there to collect donations from every parishioner.
Mike Mandala is the reason why this particular churxh lost so many members over the years....people..serve the community but not the man that calls himself the leader of the church. The hypocrisy is larger than life!!!....sure, he speaks nice when nothing is being asked from him...but put him through a test...</Review>

(Translated by Google) This parish occupies many, many changes, it is noticeable that they are more occupied with social things such as their trips to the casinos instead of doing spiritual retreats Yolanda and Mrs. Mercedes if they cannot do good things they leave office and leave people who really seek to evangelize the people.

(Original)
Esta parroquia ocupa muchos pero muchos cambios se nota que se ocupan mas con cosas sociales como sus viajes a los casinos en lugar de hacer retiros espirituales yolanda y la señora Mercedes si no pueden hacer cosas buenas que dejen el cargo y dejen a gente que de verdad busque evangelizar al pueblo.</Review>

<Text>It's an odd little bar located near great food stops. The decor is based off of a fun house, but it's not too over the top. I got a strawberry margarita. It was so delicious and the strawberry was fresh! I loved the bar seating. The barstools are on springs/coils to further emphasize the "fun house" theme. Come here for a pre-dinner drink for a fun conversation starter.</Text>< pictures>

Best drinks in Pasadena. Covid friendly. Pick up your canned cocktail (taken from tap and bottled in front of you) and run it home. Seriously talented cocktail designer. Has to be the best I've had since moving to California six years ago. (I hear they're also working on outdoor space for August)

My rec: Strawberry Buck. Has a bite but so tasty.< /review>

Incredible food. Wow, the apple pie, brie burger is mindblowing. The fried chicken sandwich was really good too. Ambience, music and service quality incredible too. They constantly keep feeling your water and they are very knowledgeable and detailed when describing the food. Great experience and I would come back. It is somewhat pricey though.< /Review>

I ordered White Horse Lounge's New Year's Eve cocktail package, and it was the BEST way to ring in the new year.</Text>

Super chill atmosphere. Lots of space to sit or even lounge in couches. I can't speak on behalf of the food, but the drinks are absolutely incredible! They definitely have their own version of cocktails that I've never had before.

I was originally going to give four stars but on the last drink the bartender actually came over to our table and lit it on fire and did an entire show, it was so awesome! It was called the forbidden. He said he doesn't always do it tableside, so don't expect it, but when he has time he does.

We would recommend this. We will be back for happy hour.<//Review>

Darkly wood panelled place, dine in the pseudo "old" style. Overstuffed stools, a couch or two and a secondary bar level stooped area make for abundant seating. Service was uneven, as it took the staff over 10 minutes to notice that we were there (not many of them were out) but once we were noticed, a number of servers and associated workers appeared, as if they were all occupied elsewhere and just got let out; it was odd. The service, once the servers were "out", was prompt and professional. Drinks are not cheap but I had the feeling they are trying to represent themselves as an "established" place but the feel was more if an "upscaley" place; we're popular and you're fortunate to be eating our fine food. The food was quite good. The drinks were quite tasty (they know what they're doing) but I wouldn't go there for drinks (too little for what is charged) unless I pulled in 100k yearly, imho.  4.5 STARS< /Review>

<text>White Horse is a really great place to visit for delicious New Orleans Cajun. The food and drinks are very well priced for the outstanding quality you get, and the servers and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable as well. Feel safe when visiting, everything is being done with the COVID best practice requirements. Great happy hour offerings as well, especially for those that like 'Old Fashioneds'. I really liked and appreciated the old school music and old fashioned dim bar surroundings, it really was refreshing. The dark wood and red upholstery The exterior design is very tasteful and catches your attention when passing by. The set up works great for those looking for a group setting or even just for couples. I found the brunch menu to be especially enticing, I'm going to need to come back a couple of times to try out all the things that looked promising. The parking structure is right next door for maximum convenience. This place is truly a hidden gem amongst all the other great places in Pasadena. I'm also looking forward to checking out their sister location, Craft Hill, which I've heard great things about. Brandon was an amazing team member and recommended the fried chicken sandwich, which was fantastic. He knew all the items on the menu almost from memory and went above and beyond to walk me through everything. I'm glad I went with his recommendations. He also told me some cool things to do in the area and South Pasadena, so I have those on my list as well. They don't skip on the portions either, you'll definitely satisfy your appetite and probably have some leftovers as well. I can't think of much they can do to improve things, everything was so great! I plan on visiting again sooner rather than later.</text>< Pictures>

Great bar and restaurant. Loved the menu and service. Definitely a place I will visit again for cocktails and food. Especially enjoyed the bartenders and their dedication to local ingredients as well as the classics. Go for the cocktails and stay for the food.< /review>

The White Horse Lounge is a very nice upscale place. They have a fairly decent happy hour, and the staff is always more than accommodating. Fancy cocktails with flowers in them, and some good appetizers in the bar area. They have a restaurant portion as well, but I've honestly never made it that far.</Text>

The food is really amazing and they never have the same menu for a very long time so if you haven't been there in a while you probably missed a few dishes they make some of the amazing southern style dishes like for example fried green tomato you can never find that anywhere else I never see that in any menu in any restaurant at all The atmosphere is very relaxing and amazing a very romantic place. A perfect place for a date</Review>

Nice choice of music from all different genres that was perfect volume. Definitely good for groups as well and once the dining area closes you can just move to the bar area that still has cozy seating. Loved it and will be back. Parking is even cheap and easy.

If I weren't a vegetarian, is give it 5 stars - not a huge menu for us vegetarians, but you gotta know that going in. A really cool vibe, intimate rooms to dine without the bar noise, and a Cajun menu that definitely reminds me of my time in New Orleans. The drinks were really good, too. I had a couple of Strawberry Bucks that were delicious. I wish I'd had more room for dessert.< /Text>

<Text>Would've been 5-star except for bottomless mimosas said they were served until 3pm, but they do last call at 2:30pm. WTH? They need to change the time on the menu. We had the fried chicken and Avocado Bruchetta - excellent and would definitely return for both. Home.ade biscuits come with chicken and they are delicious! I ordered a single mimosa - tasty, except served in a margarita glass...yes, I like proper stemware. Waiter was attentive and food was great! Would go earlier for brunch and be early for mimosa's!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfXJQDViaH4PCq_oFQNeUU1COLYlgpAi628MJ-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNct49qZPKdNfIkYWLgcHeQYd8-uG7-rKlb-4lH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2c37131b91407:0x665921b8ebcce1a5</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We came here for our anniversary and it was even better the second time. The salmon was perfectly seared and of course the brisket is out of this world. We had the key lime for dessert and it was the best we've ever had! Thank you Chef Josh for pouring so much love into the food you serve! Karina is a top notch server. This is quickly becoming one of our favorite places to dine!</text>

The WHL does not disappoint! This was my second time, the first being a late night "bar menu" which is just as spectacular as the main dinning menu. The drinks are creative and tasty and full of flavor. A must if you've never been. Oh and eventually I'll get to the brunch, it's supposed to be even better!< /Text>

Good place for brunch if you enjoy creole food. I recommend the Shrimp n' Grits or the Breakfast Skillet. Good size portions on the food. They also have delicious craft cocktails and bottomless mimosas.
If you have a large party I recommend making a reservation.<//Text>

The atmosphere is wonderful and it has the look and feel of a lounge from the 1940s. The cocktails are nicely prepared and the food portions are large. Would recommend going here for a nice night out. Also fairly casual. No need to get overly dressed up.< /text>

Went for happy hour and the old fashioned is excellent for a steal especially for the area. Catfish on happy hour was some of the best I have ever had. Be here at open for an awesome happy hour.<//text>

<review>I don't even know where to start! We came for a group outing and the restaurant is beautiful to start! Tucked away in Old Town Pasadena...the ambiance feels like Louisiana. We had a beautiful room with apropos music and the wait staff were patient, funny and helpful. The food was amazing. Everything we ordered was so good. It was good made from love. Big Josh (Executive Chef) came in and his southern demeanor and wit won us over. We will be coming back to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday soon! You'll be hearing from us Big Josh! Great, great place!< /review>< Pics>

<Time>1562450874924</Time><Text>Went for a date night and the service was amazing, the food was delicious, drinks were tasty and good quality, and the whole ambiance was just cozy and romantic but also casual still. Nice choice of music from all different genres that was perfect volume. Definitely good for groups as well and once the dining area closes you can just move to the bar area that still has cozy seating. Loved it and will be back. Parking is even cheap and easy. Highly recommend.</Text></record>

<review>If I weren't a vegetarian, is give it 5 stars - not a huge menu for us vegetarians, but you gotta know that going in. A really cool vibe, intimate rooms to dine without the bar noise, and a Cajun menu that definitely reminds me of my time in New Orleans. The drinks were really good, too. I had a couple of Strawberry Bucks that were delicious. I wish I'd had more room for dessert.< /review>< Response>

Good place for brunch if you enjoy creole food. I recommend the Shrimp n' Grits or the Breakfast Skillet. Good size portions on the food. They also have delicious craft cocktails and bottomless mimosas.
If you have a large party I recommend making a reservation.</Text>

<username>Marc Larrañaga<//username><review>The WHL does not disappoint! This was my second time, the first being a late night "bar menu" which is just as spectacular as the main dinning menu. The drinks are creative and tasty and full of flavor. A must if you've never been.

<Review>The atmosphere is wonderful and it has the look and feel of a lounge from the 1940s. The cocktails are nicely prepared and the food portions are large. Would recommend going here for a nice night out. Also fairly casual. No need to get overly dressed up.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Good food. Bottomless mimosas for brunch. Would have been five stars, but service wasn't so great. We were a large party, maybe that has something to do with it. I ordered the omelette, delicious. The bloody Mary was pretty good too, but small for the price.<//Review>

Pretty pricey on the drinks. Only had fries (amazing), but saw the food on other tables and it all looked very delicious. Music was very diverse, and that's appreciated. Bartenders were friendly, but super slow, I waited at least 20 minutes for drinks on a Thursday night. Seems cool for a date, I was in a group setting. Didnt seem crowded but everywhere I stood I felt "in the way". Not my vibe but I also didn't hate it.</review>

Great drinks. Great vibe. I didn’t do a 5th star because we didn’t have any food.

Only here to pre-game for the Rose bowl. Fantastic spot. Great bartenders. Great service. Small up for front bar.

Will come back next time in Pasadena to try the menu.< /review>

Went on a bustling Saturday night and got a table for 5 right away. The dining area is dimly lit and vibe was lively. "Big Josh", the executive chef was awesome. His Louisiana style cooking and recopies is plenty just as it is delicious. Their fried chicken was so huge only a few people maybe able to finish it in one sitting. The cocktails were good. They actually messed up my drink a bit but gave me 2 and comped me for both.< /Review>

The Last Minute was delicious. This is a very unique and complex drink, subtle notes of chocolate, ancho chile and a smokey scent.  A must try!< /Review>

Cozy place with an old timey bar feel. We sat in the bar and had good service and some tasty drinks. My hubby and I were out on a date and the music (though good) was very loud and it was hard to hear each other even though we were sitting next to one another - we left after one drink. Probably a fun place if you like super loud music.<//text>

Good drinks, friendly staff, not totally rip-off prices - which for this location, is pretty d@mned impressive!

One suggestion, they have a "Bartender's choice" drink - ask what it is, but it's probably one of your best bets. Enjoy!<//Review>

The food is an explosion of flavors and mouth watering treats! I kind you not.The Southern fried chicken is seasoned to delight, the Hoe cake was the best the salmon avec haricot verts satisfies the palate with lightness, and the drinks well let's just say they don't hold back! This place was absolutely perfect and a great customer service.< /review>< pics>

I like to cook. I do. I really really do. So I already know when I go out to eat that I can prepare the meal I’m going to eat just as well as the restaurant for a fraction of the price. Therefore service, ambiance, and cleanliness are of the upmost importance to me.

Before I start with the bad I should really say that the food was outstanding. Very flavorful and well presented. The ambiance was relaxed making the White Horse seem like a popular place among the young and old alike. Cleanliness in the bar and restrooms was above average.

My only complaint was the attentiveness and speed of the staff.  Our drink orders took forever. Our food (two dishes) was delivered about fifteen minutes apart and it seems they really didn’t want to bring us the check.

Overall it was a good experience. However, with dozens and dozens of restaurants to choose from, owners/managers must strive for perfection in all aspects of their restaurant and not just the food. When it comes down to it, almost anyone can make a tuna sandwich and mix a drink.<//Text>

<time>1583312770688<//time><Rating>2</Rating><review>A packed dining room and bar put this place quite in the limelight as you enter on a weekend evening. Unfortunately, there were far too many misses to honestly click on an extra star for the rating.

The bar seriously needs to pay attention to customers. Waiting for my party and waiting at the bar, and trying to get a drink was an impossible 5 minutes. They were treating me like I just came out of an AA meeting.

The menu seems to hit most of the notes for a hungry patron. At first glance, you can see it is well designed. Something for everyone wraps the context of each category. Fine Wagyu meats, a great burger, your standard salmon dish, and an attractive Southern Fried Chicken.

Dig deeper and you can find the pretentiousness of certain items. The use of Wagyu in smoked brisket, for example, is quite a redundancy. Why pay for a Wagyu priced cut that is supposed to be slow-smoked/cooked?

The Jumbalaya Rissoto is in fact not "risotto," and made with orzo pasta. Granted it is stated in the description as orzo, the title is completely misleading. If a person was gluten intolerant this would be a horrific experience. This dish is totally not worthy of the $26 price tag for a pasta dish.

The service felt like the servers were really working hard. I overheard a waiter mumbling about covering 8 large tables. I commend the service timing for everyone at the table.

The drinks here are very good. The bar certainly displays some craft behind their creations. I would return for their happy hour, and possibly a revisit for a sample of other items.

I do miss Cheval Blanc that once took this location to new heights in french cuisine.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The mac and cheese was salty, The fried green tomatoes were about the only descent item on the menu. I was asked only once if I wanted a refill (I was drinking Stella) when I said yes they were having problems with the keg. 2 other people we were with ordered mixed drinks and were asked only once. I would have ordered 3 or 4 beers if the server had been more on it. The only thing that made it a tad better was that we were there at happy hour! We will NOT be returning!!<//review><Response>None<//Response>< user_name>

I was here for a rehearsal dinner two weeks ago. We had tri-tip, chicken, mashed potatoes, and a salad. All of the food was excellent... the meat was so tender, and the potatoes has a pleasantly surprising kick!! Honestly, the food here was better than the food catered at the wedding by Buttercup.<//review>

I've only come here for the bar and drinks, never had the food. The drinks are all great, well thought out, and delicious. They switch up the cocktail menu every couple of months, so there's always something new to try as well. For Pasadena, the drinks are fairly priced and the bartenders are super knowledgeable.

It can get pretty packed and hard to flag down someone to order a drink sometimes. It''s a great place to have some drinks before going to a club or just have a chill night talking with some friends.</Text>

There are better places in Pasadena. Stopped by two nights in a row. First for dinner and the next for drinks. Both experiences left me fairly ready to move on to the next place. Beer options available on tap are decent. Food options are limited although they do provide variety (chicken, beef, seafood, pasta, salad, etc.).<//text>

The bartenders are very well informed on different mixology styles and techniques and are very attentive even when the place is bustling. The food is really great as well, you've got your usual garlic fries and appetizers but their entrees are also excellent.

<text>Great food with a wide variety of options. Not cheap, but not over-priced either and you can't beat the ambiance, location, or level of service. Nestled in the middle of downtown Pasadena, the location is prime as a jumping off point for a nice meal and a couple of drinks before a night out on the town.< /text></record></dataset><record>

A very nice place. Terrific cocktails. Good service. Quiet setting. The brussel sprouts are really nice and the Boudin balls have great flavor. Salmon on Isreali couscous has a great glaze. The gumbo was ok. Nothing great.
The bread pudding was really average. Go for the beignets instead.
Overall very nice. Just a tic below great< /Review>

they must go through a rigorous process with the Bartenders, they can mix a hell of a drink. The Signature drinks are very tasty and well worth it.

The burger was cooked great, very little seasoning allowing you to take in the taste of the beef. You can select Garlic Fries with this which I must say for being a dish you see at a lot places, this really does stand out on it's own. Not overpowering with Parmesan which you find a lot of times.

The Shrimp and Grits was fantastic. Chunks of Chorizo and Hominy really brought out this dish . I really recommend this.<//text>

The bread pudding was really average. Go for the beignets instead.
Overall very nice. Just a tic below great</Review>< Rate>

Just know that I love Roy's, and if you get the chance, you should eat there. They have made multiple changes to the menu (added lots of Sushi), and the new dishes are outstanding. Service is spot on and Keith (Managing Partner) makes sure that Roy's is run to the highest standard.</Review>

I came here last night for my birthday. First I gotta say the food deserves 5 stars. The food was fresh and delicious. I'm knocking off 3 stars because of our interaction with the Manager Cameron. My wife reserved a room for my birthday party and out of nowhere the waitress let us know we had 10 minutes to clear the room (decorations, etc.) because another party was going to sit there. They  didn't even have another table to transition us to. The waitress was pretty much like, "I guess you can sit at one of the other tables." Odd thing is, once we moved to the outside area we never saw anyone move into where we sitting. So why have us move out? My wife complained to the Manager Cameron about this and he preceded to argue back with my wife for about 30 minutes. He explained to my wife that the party that was going to move into our section decided to stay at the bar area afterall. We will  never be back to this restaurant again, which is a shame because like I said, the food was delicious. The way Cameron handled this situation was poor. Somebody needs to train this guy on how to provide good customer service. There is no excuse for him to try to win an argument with a paying customer (we spent over $900). With his actions he pretty much said, "we got these guys $900. Get 'em out so we can collect on this new group."<//Text>

Some of the worst food I've ever tasted.  It was shocking.  The drinks actually were good, as was the service. The Buffalo Brass, the wings, and the hoecake were all bland.  The apple pie burger was... fine... I mean... Why?  For what purpose?  But it was edible.  The beignets and the bread pudding was not.  At least everything was expensive!  Never again...<//text>

Happy hour has some good deals. The burger was very good and the bacon was the thickest sliced pieces I've ever seen, it was awesome. The decor seems very nice, but when I visited, the place had a very casual vibe, but then again, most of the patrons were on their way to a Metallica concert, so I'm not sure if that crowd is typical, but it was a good experience. There's a parking garage right next door with first 90 minutes free.</review>

The white horse is a throw back to the early days when bars that have quaint feel to them. They have a lot of setting. The white horse gets a noise level that is deafening in the evening, so don't have any deep conversation. The drinks are amazing. I had a Manhattan and I would have to say it was the bomb.< /review>

Great lounge. Yummy food. Apparently it's a place for drinkers, but I thought it was super chill and mellow. Plan to return soon.< /Text>

The problem with places like this is that when it gets busy these drinks take entirely way too long. An simple request for a beer turns into a 20mins wait while fruit is massaged, sage is burned, ice is sweated... Props to the idea but practicality wins in places that last more than a year< /text>< Pics>

What a wonderful surprise!! The White Horse Lounge is a great place for family, out of town guest spot, romantic two or just friends! The food is an explosion of flavors and mouth watering treats! I kind you not.. the southern fried chicken is seasoned to delight, the Hoe cake made me moooan, the salmon avec haricot verts satisfies the palate with lightness.. and the drinks..well let's just say they don't hold back! The ambiance is Nu Oleans almost classic brothel style with elegant private cubbies tucked aside; it's warm and welcoming and smooth music playing in the background will catch you for a recognizable song.. the service is exceptional, making sure you're delighted to be there. The chef is to be applauded..my understanding is he's been there about a year and a half and he's for sure making a statement at the White Horse Lounge! Oh and did I mention the Blackberry peach cobbler!! The place is high on my list you won't be disappointed!!</Text>

Worst place ever. No seating and you always need to  stand as it’s tiny place.  No one cares about you. I ordered fried chicken and beignets and it was so worst . Very bad preparation , taste and quality .. not sure how it got good reviews . I wouldn’t recommend< /review>

<review>Classy speakeasy ambiance, with amazing crafted cocktails... Got the Killing Thyme (aperol and st. Germaine), which was yummy and involved torched herbs..fun!

Friendly bartenders and a good range of happy hour deals. The truffle parmesan fries are delicious!</review>< user_id>

Walking into Roys, I wasn't expecting much in the way of satisfaction to the palate. I visit Hawaii often and my overall impression has always been, that what the island lacks in sophistication as it relates to dining, is excused because of the location.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Service was outstanding! Appetizers were all good, but the truffle fries were worth cheating on your diet. The hush puppies were really very plain falafel. Skip those until the chef figured out whether to make true southern hush puppies or actual falafel. The margarita and The Smartass were perfectly sweet. We'd definitely go back.</text>< pics>

On an early Saturday morning we filled the place with our wedding party. Nice warm setting. Attentive servers. Food appropriate for 'tavern style'..ok and good portions. Drinks a bit pricy. (Ex. $10 for glass of house white wine) but if the mood is good maybe that's ok.</review>

We stopped by and has Arroyo hamburger which was fantastic. Big Josh, the chef stopped by and revealed that the every ingrediants used here is from a local and certified grower. We had Judy taken care of us.

Josh was proud of his cooking style learned from her Japanese granma.

A classy place with great selection and service. We just dropped in and got hooked.

We sat in and Cesar took our order. He suggested Strawberry Buck and Peach Schnapps to start with which were both sweet drinks and fit the occasion. Bertta, the manager stopped by and chatted with us over the specials for the night.

The Bread and Butter we got was warmly toasted with some  greens and slice of pork. We ordered Porklion and Arroyo Burger. Both were good and tasty. The portions were adequate.

We ended with Pear cobbler with scoop of ice cream. Well made and filling.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><gmap_id>0x80c2c37131b91407:0x665921b8ebcce1a5</gmap_id><Response>None<//Response></record>

<text>ordered the pesto sandwhich with truffle fries  it was righy on the money the pesto was fresh the chicken tender  the chibatta softer than other chibbattas I've had the 5 cheese Mac  was deliscious. I came to white horse because i saw their Mac and cheese  went on a date she orderd the steak and potatoes plate they are amazing cooks. Her potatoes were so rich in buttery flavor and a creamy thickness that people strive for when they claim they have the best in town.I want to disagree with who ever  didn't  like the food i want to try mor items from the menu the Georgia  smash was mixed well.<//text>< pics>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>We came to White Horse Lounge in Pasadena to celebrate a friend's birthday.
Love the beautiful bar area. It’s got that classic American bar vibe.
Since we have a large party, we were seated in the private room in the back.
Very simple one page menu. They have quite a few small bites that are great with drinks.

Market Hummus | $10
House Lavash, EVOO, Fresh Garnish
We ordered a few appetizers to share.
Market Hummus was just ok. It lacked flavor.

Seared Brussel Sprouts | $10
Smoked Tomatoes, Basil, Parmesan
Seared Brussel Sprouts was great. We enjoyed the addition of tomatoes and basil.

Garlic Truffle Fries | $9
Truffle Oil, Parmesan, Gremolata
We love the Garlic Truffle Fries. Thick and crunchy fries seasoned with truffle oil and cheese.

Bone-In New York 22 oz | $45
For steak orders, guests can pick 2 sides and a sauce for the meat.
A friend ordered the huge Bone-In New York, and she almost finished it!
She likes the steak, but didn’t like the cajun butter sauce.

Ribeye 16 oz | $35
Dr. P and I both ordered the Ribeye.
The steak was cooked perfectly. Very delicious.
For sides, I got the twice baked potato and corn succotash.
I enjoyed both. And the horseradish sauce was great with the steak.

The Black Sea | $25
Squid Ink Tagliolini, Dinapoli Tomato, Calamari, Prawn, Finés Herbes
A few people ordered The Black Sea – the squid ink seafood pasta.
Everyone said it was way too salty, and nobody liked it.

I like that we had the private room, and could be as loud as we want.
Service could be better. Our waitress didn’t check on us often.
We had to go out to find her a few times.
It was a really fun night with friends.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2c37131b91407:0x665921b8ebcce1a5<//GmapID></record>

<Review>Great ambiance and good appetizers. Pretty disappointing on entrees.

Crispy Shrimp - delicious, small portion
Ahi Poke Tower - good; crunchy, sauce tastes like teriyaki instead of ponzu, small portion
Garlic Truffle Fries - good, decent portion

Besto Pesto - okay; too much sauce, falls apart easily
The Regal - bad; steak is tender, salty sauce, not worth the price
The Black Sea - okay, handmade pasta is too thin, sauce could be better, not worth the price

Beignet - delicious, warm donuts that go well with chocolate-hazelnut sauce
Chocolate mousse cake - okay, very heavy chocolate taste< /Review>< Pictures>

I was there few nights ago to try their new menu items. I tried two different types of kale salad, stuffed mushrooms, mashed potato, turmeric rice, buffalo brass, filet mignon, creme brulee and fried twinkie with ice cream. I'm pretty satisfied. The service was great, the food was good, my favorite was filet mignon and buffalo brass, which is fried cauliflower in buffalo sauce. When I saw it on the table, it looks just like chicken wings but it's cauliflower. Mashed potato wasn't my favorite, it didn't have much flavor but that means it's healthy. Everything was pretty healthy yet tasty.< /text>

<text>Holy Moly!!! One of the best bars in the universe! Between bartender Brett's "Angry Squirter" drink - a spritzy, lemony orange, refreshing yet sensual concoction,....to bartender Brian's "Burnt Orange" drink - a Rye, charred orange, bitters, & in house made grenadine, the White House Lounge had something for everyone. The beautiful curly birch bar that was imported from 1908 old town Chicago is a must see! Other drinks to try are the Punch 41 & the Smartass. Not to mention the guiness reduction & cabernet reduction are amazing...good enough for pancake syrup!  :p. LOVE THESE GUYS. Can't wait to come back!

<name>Norma Cervantes< /name><Pics>None</Pics><review>(Translated by Google) I ordered a Salmon dish, and since I'm allergic to cucus and quinoa, I told them, and they brought me the Salmon dish but honestly, it was not delicious, it was simple without flavor without salt without seasoning, my husband ordered the same dish of Salmon and He told me that the dish was excellent and juicy. Some restaurants should think about these situations so that everyone can enjoy their delicacies. Thanks to Ehite Horse restaurant.
