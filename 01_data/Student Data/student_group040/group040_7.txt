We both live an more than an hour away. The 800 number tells me I'm 168th (etc) in line and to leave a call back number every time i call. Never a return. The only number that goes to a human is the dental office cell and her only offer of help was to tell me it is not her department and that is up to "them" to decide whether or not to call me back??? Really?? I call bs< /review>< user_name>

My kids were seen really fast and the doctor tried his best to be patient with my 4 year old.  They hardly had any options for glasses though.< /Review>

<review>Just had my worst experience with whoever's in charge scheduling the appointments!!! First I had my appointment on the 8th of this month, just called back to make a confirmation and they told me they didn't have no appointments so they change it for the 20! just hung up the phone and now they're telling me that they only have one appointment for only one kid not two!!! And if I need for two kids to go at the same day I will have to wait another 2 months!!!!!!. So mad right now !!!!!</review>< Pics>

<review>Dr. Nelson is a podiatrist is this clinic. He is personable, charming and made a very painful procedure as not scary as could be. Not only that, he did an exceptional job with my young son, giving far more time and personal attention than would asked of a busy doctor. Its a full service clinic, everything (almost) you could need all in one place.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80ea401bce6d00c3:0xdefcb1a999655390< /GmapID></record>

<response>None<//response><Text>So far so good. I've been here twice (for medical and chiropractic purposes) and both times I gotta say I had nothing but a great experience and short waiting times. The ladies in the front office are great and understanding. They treat you with courtesy and if you have any questions they are more than happy to assist you. I also love the convenience of having pharmacy and optometry  all in one building. Makes it way much easier to get everything done in one day!< /Text>< rate>

I fell into a deep depression not having my medication. I'm glad all Is well now but i hope no one else has to go through that with them.

<Text>Nice place but their policys are no good. My wife had her first appointment with the pregnancy coach. We made it to the appointment on time. The front desk girl tells us that the coach is out because of a family emergency. And that our appointment is cancelled. And that the next available time is mid December! We waited weeks for this appointment and just waisted a day. Definitely taking my wife and my business somewhere else. I suggest you do the same.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Omni Valley Health has it going on. It has programs for all different kind of patients and accommodate its different ethnic backgrounds as well as different patient needs. It's clinics are clean, we'll organize, and very professional. You cannot do better than to become a patient at Omni clinics.</review>

This Omni Health Care facility on Panama in Bakersfield is probably the best clinic they have. All the staff was very helpful & friendly. It's also the cleanest facility.<//Review>

I don’t like Omni place.all the time I need to wait for 2 hours and they didn’t give you an estimate and said all the time that room is not available now.but call other people inside.they just want you to go back and and if you wait they will call you in the room when it’s time to close. And they don’t give the reports if you ask . i hate it<//review>

If there would be an option to put a 0 or negative star, I would. It seems like a lot of people has had a lot of bad experience here. Not only Dr. Park and some of its staffs here are rude, but this will be the last time l'll be going here. Someone needs to rework this office or replace Dr. Park and some of its staffs here. I had the worst experience here with Dr. Park who doesn't seem to enjoy his job or helping any of his clients at all. And after hearing, reading reviews and feedback from other people and their experience here on the internet, there is no doubt at this place is just not a place you would want to go to. You are not treated kindly or as a human being! I'm actually serious. Even though you may see other people are being treated fairly, but it's not always the case here, I've noticed more than 2/3 (70% of the time) are treated unfairly, from what I've seen through my visits here on several occasions. You aren't treated friendly even if you're a customer trying to find out what's going on with your health. And Dr. Park misdiagnoses you or can't find anything wrong, how is he still even here?  What a very lousy and incompetent and inexperienced Doctor Dr. Park is. It's especially so hard to understand him with his lack of proper English. This Doctor has no interpersonal skills or people skills at all, and he doesn't even listen to what you have to say or find out what the problem is. He also gives you a condescending look and attitude. I would look elsewhere and use your health insurance at a different location because everyone always seem to have a bad experience here. This will be the last time I'll be going here. I don't recommend going here to not be treated properly as a human being. I believe Dr. Park is probably the only doctor here who is just absolutely unprofessional. Don't come here. This place should be taken down or re-worked completely.</review>

I am updating my info, even though I had a lot of trouble to begin with, Omni has made a huge effort to rectify the problem.  They have decided to price match from GoodRx that I would have recieved at Costco. Thank you, this is a very much needed medication and I didn't know what I was going to do.</review>

<Review>So I walked in knowing I'd wait like an hour or 2. Waited maybe 3 1/2 hours. Doctor saw me for 2 minutes and didn't even care about my problems and he was mumbling on top of his accent so I couldn't even understand what he was saying. All my concerns were shrugged off like nothing. Never going here again<//Review>< UserId.>

I can only review the behavioral health section because I go to a different Omni office for medical. When I go in it’s always quick, mostly less than 5 min wait but once I waited like 15 min. The staff of the behavioral health is kind and professional. No complaints from me yet.< /review>

I feel like the staff would be better if they had a better doctor to work for! This guy (Dr Park) did not listen to anything I said. He wanted me to continue to return to him ($20 co-pay every visit) for 4 office visits to get a referral for things he couldn't treat.
Did the same thing with my husband. Had him retuning once a month for a skin condition only a dermatologist could treat! Never did send him to dermatologist, had to change doctors through insurance company to finally see a dermatologist!</Review>

If you go there be ready to see rude faces & bad attitude in the front desk .
I tried since March to get seen by a doctor I was already at 34 weeks pregnant I moved out from LA and I they didn’t care about my situation they would never request my medical records from my old clinic. They would call me saying they had my records and would make an appointment and when I would go they would say they didn’t have my records and send me home . I was literally back and forth . It’s May now and I am 39 weeks and they refused to see me they never ever saw me so I can’t say anything  about the doctors but I will never go back to that careless clinic</Text>

<review>Doctor Park is a joke. By far the worst doctor I've ever seen. I've had the same ongoing problem for three months and I've came in to see him three times eventually having to go to an emergency room where I was diagnosed. The emergency room sent me back to primary care or even with a diagnosis he still did nothing for me and sent me to a urologist which will take 15 days to see. He's just a doctor trying to get your co-pays as much as possible. He wouldn't even give me a continued prescription of something my last doctor has been prescribing me for the past 3 years which is a very basic prescription heartburn medication. Don't waste your time with this doctor you will be running around for months and will likely die of your condition before he does anything about it personally</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea401bce6d00c3:0xdefcb1a999655390<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have doctors there and I go see every month or every couple months and I like to act in fear I like the doctors there are very well-mannered and the few have questions that need to be answered they help you out and assassins great there too I am if you need a good doctor go to me and you'll get good service they take good care of you whatever else you.</Text>

Ridiculous service for pregnant people. They don’t do ultrasounds there. Then there was a rude lady (who was suppose to educate me on the pregnancy) just gave me pamphlets and didn’t answer my questions and concerns. My portal says the first nurse perscribed iron and prenatal which wasn’t true I had to get my own. They didn’t know how many weeks I am. They sent me to a radiology center far away. I was ready to do an ultra sound and they told me the clinic wrote down a week way too far from my pregnancy. The clinic wrote 2nd trimester so the radiology got ready for a 2nd trimester. She later found out I was still in my first trimester. I had to wait until they adjusted the equipment and she had to do other paperwork because the clinic gave them an exaggerated week number.< /review>

Dr. Park really needs to go back to school to learn better english, couldn't understand a word he said. My husband went in for test results but could not understand what Dr park said all he told him was he had IBS didn't even help him with a treatment plan. Went back to see a different Dr she told him that he didn't have IBS but he had acid reflux gave him a prescription went to the pharmacy and nothing was called in. This office just plan out sucks, you can be dying and they will still either misdiagnose you or make you wait two hours to be seen by a Dr who doesn't speak english very well.<//review>

<username>Mitch Ramirez< /username><Text>For medical, when they see you with or without an appointment, they always seem like theyre rushing you, you literally wait so long then they only see you for a couple of minutes, they make you feel like "hurry up and ask whatever you gotta ask so I can move on to my next patient" so I ended up not asking all questions I wanted to ask because I feel being rush and I forget them when I feel pressured. Oh and one time, I came in at 4pm as walk in but told me I can't be seen after they made me wait 30 min.
For OBGYN, I asked for my old birth control that I used to take because they prescribed me something that gives me bad side effect but they still prescribed me something different that still gives me bad side effects
For Dental, my 2nd appointment, the doctor called in so they told me I can be seen by another doctor but the wait time will be very long, so I rescheduled.
I made an appointment for 9:15am and it's almost freaking 10am, i even came before my appointment, so im pretty much waiting for almost an hour and I'm writing this as I'm waiting,
I'm very frustrated because I made an appointment for a reason and I got somewhere to be like work, I'm cancelling if I'm still not seen passed 10am
!!UPDATE!!
I ended up asking the front desk how much more time do I need wait so then they call me in the room, I waited for an hour and 5 min. and they clean my teeth for 10 min.! (SMH)<//Text><gmap_id>0x80ea401bce6d00c3:0xdefcb1a999655390</gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

Can't schedule an appointment because their automated system is always down. The doctors don't care about helping their patients. Walk-ins are until 5pm, but the doctors won't see you if you come at 4pm. They keep sending my meds to the wrong pharmacy after I told them numerous times to change it. You have to schedule an appointment in order to get test results so they can charge your insurance for the doctor's visit. Basically, the worst clinic I've experienced.<//Review>< date>

Very unfriendly staff. Extremely in unhygienic clinic. It is my first time here. Never coming back. I have good insurance but they treat you like you have medical or so. Need to find new doctor.</text>

I've been here before. My information is in the system. There is no reason for me to be waiting an hour after my appt time (still waiting by the way). Receptionist is rude and doesn't want to schedule appts so she tells them to come back. Poor phone etiquette and the whole waiting room can hear her. Please work on the scheduling and set a specific time for walk-ins so the people who have appts aren't waiting. We have things to do too. We should not have to take an entire day off just for one Dr appt.</Review>

As far as Omni Family Health Care goes, this location is the best one.  With that being said, Omni is the absolute worst medical facility I have ever encountered...and that is saying something as I normally deal with the VA.

Here are just a few examples of my experience.  My 18 year old daughter picked up a pretty nasty addiction to painkillers.  After explaining this to the her primary care physician he prescribed her sixty...that 60...Tramadol for a sore back.  After I found this out I went to them and explained she has an addiction.  Behind my back my daughter again went to them and again was able to get another 60 Tramadol for a sore back ONE WEEK after the first prescription.  So 120 Tramadol over a 2 week period.

I have high blood pressure.  When I started being treated by Omni they changed my prescription, no reason why...they just did.  I began having ED issues.  A side effect from my meds I found out.   I told my doctor and his exact words were, "well, that's doesn't matter, it is more important to keep your blood pressure under control".  So I can't have sex and rather than change my meds they told me to "suck it up".

After a visit to the doctor where he prescribed me blood pressure meds Omni did not fill my prescription at my pharmacy.  After numerous calls (which I will talk about later) they demanded I come back in to get seen by the doctor again before they filled my prescription.  However, the closest appointment was 6 WEEKS away.  I went 6 weeks without my meds.

One of my personal favorites, my doctor did blood work on me.  I asked for a copy to show to another doctor for a second opinion and they refused to let me have my medical records.

Finally, before you go to this facility.  Just give them a call.  Once in a while they have a receptionist answer, but she will quite literally know nothing and transfer you to no where. However, on most occasions you can't get anyone to answer.

This place does not care at all for your well being.  They are just looking to process you as fast as possible and get you out the door.  Ironically, they are not very good at that because an 8am appointment will get you seen at about 10am.  If you leave with your issues solved, consider yourself very lucky.<//review>

all the omni facilities are the same they are going in the same training my wife have to call for 3 days before she can really make an apt on panama clinic she has to make an apt for results on a specialist than we went to the one on ming ave is a coraen doctor the worst of the worst he when in the room and he just started doing check up on my Wife and he said that she has a cold and my wafe was going to get an specialist transfer for her kidney she do not speak any english  and he never got some one to translate and at the end I asked the doctor that base on what diagnostic he said that my wife had a flue  and he said that he knows he was the doctor  at the end him the front lady said that the are going to call us with another apt never happens  but both of the clinics are the same the front ladies they are always acting like if they are the doctor and they are the decision maker for the doctors and not the doctor. some needs to pay attention to this problem and more people needs to speak up not to stay quiet.</Review>

Then i was seen by the doctor (female, indian lady) and she was not even in the room with me for 2 minutes. As i was telling her my health issues she said, "ok no more questons" i was like what the hell?! And proceeded to ask her and after i finished she said, "if you keep asking questions I'll never get out of here."
Lesson learned, doctors like these are not looking out for the patient.

< review>
Dr. Karr refused to give me anymore depo shots or diet pills. She said my blood pressure was too high but refused to give me medication for that either. The doctor also always harassed me about getting a flu shot even though I told her I don't want it and to please put it in my file and to stop trying to push it on me. One time the nurse had brought the flu shot in with another shot I was supposed to get even though I told them I didn't want the flu shot. This place is insanely slow with referrals. The dental place is bad to the dentist said was too tense to work on but refused to prescribe anything to help with that. I had to dope myself up before the dentist would even touch me. The staff are uncaring, slow, and a little rude. Basically go here if you want them to do nothing or a you want a flu shot.< /review>

The overall experience was great.  The trails and dunes were awesome.  My only complaint would be that they charged me for insurance an extra 60.00 and the old man charged an extra 100.  for a little mud on the ATVs.  He was rude and not people friendly, the rest of the staff was great!! So be aware of the charges< /review>

<review>Pure awesome!  Desert Trails are super fun, very covid safe operation here, guides at the shop have great energy and are very informative.  Guides don't go with you, instead they give you a map which is really easy to follow.  Definitely do the 4 hours, it's super worth it and the prices are super fair.  Machines gave us no issues, will definitely be coming back.<//review>< userid>

This was our first time renting and riding, the staff helped make it a wonderful experience. No hidden anything , very straightforward.
Once you’re out on the road it’s pure fun!!!!
We got the half day package Worth every last dollar !
But if you wanna stop and site see I suggest the full day package which is what we’ll be getting our next time with Steve’s atv rentals Palm Springs.<//Text>

We had an amazing experience. The ATV was great. The staff was very helpfull and nice. After riding for an hour or so we had a mechanical issue. We called them out for help and they responded immediately. They picked us up and towed the vehicle. They were very fair to us since they checked their tracking system and saw that we were riding safely. They took the blame and didn't charge us extra money cuz it wasnt our fault. We totally recommend this place for great service and funfilled experience. (even it was 3 months ago, we still wanted to Express our appreciation)< /review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>We rented a 4 seat rzr paid $350 for 2 hours and the vehicle was in limp mode the whole time. We called and they gave us a fix over the phone but it only lasted for 5 minutes. So we spent our entire time just driving out to the rec area and back. Once we got back let them know the situation again and they offered a voucher.  Not acceptable we should have been given a refund. I would look elsewhere to rent. Our friends had a similar experience where they were charged for a belt $200 from this company.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Had a great day out with our side by side rental from Steve's ATV. Customer service exceeded our expectations.
Would definitely recommend for beginners!! We'd never driven an atv and we had two small kids with us. The staff were great with getting them fitted with proper helmets and making sure they would be safe and have fun while we were out. The only caution I have is you might lose/rip/destroy your map, keep it safe hahah.
Really enjoyed this activity and customer service. Thanks again!</review>

<text>ATVing around here is brilliant. Steves is 10 mins away from where it all starts. 2 hours is ok to start but you will want more the next time.
Get goggles and bring a bandana or something to keep the desert out of your mouth.
Very friendly and helpful staff. Easy booking process online. Good equipment. Come early and have the desert to yourselves.<//text>< Pics>

Front desk gave awesome customer service. The people in the garage did not. Rented out 3 quads and a sand rail. All paid insurance. One quad flipped over. When brought back the boy and old man in the garage begin to harass us. Nothing professional. Cursing and tried giving us a lecture on how if it was ours we wouldn’t have done that. At this time we have someone with multiple injuries and the old man named Jarret is having a full on argument with us. Calling the hurt victim special. The younger guy begin to add on that we left with 5 helmets and brought back none. When leaving I specifically told him we do not need helmets as to we brought our own. When confronted about the stealing of helmets he mentioned that they just randomly go missing. Accidents happen that’s the purpose of insurance. I can guarantee there’s no insurance or else things would have been smooth. Pockets “insurance money” . Will not be going back and recommend you take your money across the way.<//Text>

<review>Fantastic location. You don't need to look further tbh. 1 word to describe the process: Effortless.

You book online, show up and you're ready to go in minutes. Friendly and helpful staff, great selection, kickass track and the drive in just to reach the location is an experience in itself with its bends and scenery. Overall amazing experience and extremely competitive prices. Am coming again as soon as possible and would most definitely recommend others.</review>< pictures>

This place DEFINITELY deserves 5 stars. Also, they added 30 extra minutes to our ride just out of the kindness of their hearts!<//Review>

<Date>1582565069173</Date><review>I rented a side by side for a half day (4 hours) in Feb 2020.

Great staff who are extremely helpful and wanting your experience to be awesome.

The machine performed as it should, it was a wild ride.

If you are coming from Palm Springs / Palm Desert, make sure you have a ride back. It is about an hour away with no return transportation if you are looking to catch a cab/Uber/Lyft. I would recommend a car rental for the day if you don't already have one (I rented the least expensive car they had at Hertz for 24 hours to get there and back).

You will ride in Ocotillo Wells State Vehicular Recreational Area (85,000+ acres) which is basically a massive adult motorsports playground. Lot's to see and try. I started early in the morning to avoid the mid day heat so I had the park pretty much to myself for the first couple hours, it was awesome. The paths are clearly marked so if you want to stick to the trail it is easy, but it is great to go off path and explore.

Overall it was a great time and I would recommend it to anyone.<//review><user>102649953934041639117<//user></record>

Drivers are responsible for any damages to the vehicles, so keep that in mind when choosing insurance options and driving. We had no issues, but I imagine it would suck if something was damaged, which it would be easy to do.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1515086346298, 'text': 'Hey Danielle, thanks for your review and tips.

<Review>This company profits from scamming its customers. Their shady contract states that you are responsible for any damage or malfunction of there old worn out equipment and you will pay 300% mark up over retail replacement costs. You should really consult with an attorney before signing their contract otherwise you will pay dearly. If someone in injured or dies because of there negligence, they are not liable. This includes things like a wheel coming off. If you value your safety especially your kids, DO NOT RENT FROM THESE SCAMMERS!!!

To make a long story short, we rented for 2 days, the first day one of our UTV overheated (had 55,000 on odometer and was a piece of junk) and rendered useless with over on hour left on our time. We had to help tow back to the shop and we didnt get credit for time lost. The second day we had a blowout from an old cracked tire and was charged $363 for a brand new tire. We also lost 1 hour for both rentals waiting for the tire to be fixed. This company could care less about repeat business because they victimize the tourists.

This is a blatant scam and I would highly advise to not do business with this shady company or you too will become a victim. You are much better off renting from a private party or not renting at all.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk93FGIQErScGbDKInkRr8SsPgEqakOiqnGCMy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNL4TN87FEnnAKQKVH1zsV_4-6FC28xUE1pChYn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

Rented a 4 person utility vehicle for my father's birthday gift. The staff was quick to get us setup and out to the nearby park. The helmets and goggles which were included in the rental were far higher quality than I expected which was a pleasant surprise.

Unfortunately the utility vehicle we rented wasn't quote meant to be loaded up with four people and taken out to the rocky desert terrain but it handled well. If I were to do it again I might rent a two person vehicle or a bunch of their quads.

The fleet of vehicles to choose from is fairly extensive and the staff does a good job I'm keeping everything in good shape.

There is a bathroom on site and some fast food places in the area.<//review>

If you are visiting around the Indio area, I would highly recommend visiting this place. The staff are well-trained and very helpful, and the vehicles themselves are in very good condition. Make sure you keep the map they give you on you, because the area you can take these vehicles in is very large and there are many crossroads< /text>

Staff was super friendly and helpful. Great course. After a 6 hour day of riding the 330, super sore. For first timers, maybe the 4 hour would be sufficient if you're not looking to get super sore while still seeing a majority of the trails. Was truly an awesome experience and will definitely be returning!</Text>

<text>Never rented a razor or ATV before but had an awesome time! Rented a two seater Razor for 2 hours before sunset. The Ocotillo park/rec area was awesome. Super scenic desert with various kinds of terrain. The Razor or RZR had a gopro mount but I forgot my matching mount to slide in. So FYI, if you have a go pro print the mount that slides in.<//text><user_name>Cal</user_name><Resp>None</Resp>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) Excellent place to go to dump the stress of the city.
I recommend that you take the one for the whole day to kill a fever.
The Honda 400cc are the best.
Great machine to kick up a lot of dust and get your adrenaline pumping.
The customer service is the best, the girls give a good treatment to the customer.
There are many routes to choose from there.

(Original)
Excelente lugar para ir a botar el estrés de la ciudad.
Te recomiendo que agarres el de todo el día para que mates fiebre.
Las Honda 400cc son las mejores.👌🏻
Gran máquina para levantar mucho polvo y poner la adrenalina al tope.
La atención al cliente es la mejor dan un buen trato al cliente las chicas.
Hay muchas rutas para escoger ahí.< /Text>

< review>
Totally different approach in costume business, price and variety is good specially one day after Halloween 🎃 they offer 50% off on all stuff at second day.
Must of good items would be gone by that day or even days prior to Halloween.
Need to pay a visit in advance, also they have good parking lot in back of the building</review>

It's gone down. They need an upgrade on costumes. Same thing year after year. And you can tell if you're a late costume  shopper like myself the leftover costumes were the same leftover costumes from last year. I was eager to look for a costume for my little ones when I came in I instantly became uninterested nothing new, I left empty handed. They had a sale going on but nothing worth buying.<//review>

This store reminds me a little of Party City and a Halloween store.  They also have sports shirts for different teams and countries.  Overall, I think it's a unique store and that's a good thing.</review>

<Review>This store is closing permanently. Everything is 50% off, but it's mostly junk now. About half the store is gutted already. They're even selling off the manequins, fixtures, mirrors, and wall panels. Sad to see you go! :(<//Review>< Pics>

Great store if you're not sure what to get someone. Good gag gifts and perfect for party decorations. They go all out for Halloween. Parking can be a pain around certain big holidays, so maybe look for street parking behind the store. Friendly staff are willing to help you find something particular.</Review>

They had a 90% rack that was filled with Duck Dynasty stuff. I was able to buy $200 worth of  stuff for only $20. It was a huge hit at the party and was a great experience.

Friendly staff and good prices. Check it out if you need something small or random for a friend.<//Text>< pics>

I love this store! Everyone is super helpful and friendly. They helped me find exactly what I needed...especially at such short notice. Dolly was great! She really helped me out and she even gave me coupon! Also the ladies at the registers were super cool and helpful! Would definitely recommend this exact store if you're looking to go to an Ahh's location. 5 stars for them!!!!< /review>

They took away my backpack and said we dont allow bags or pack packs. Even tho there were tons of people with back packs and bags. So I felt judge as a criminal. We left as soon as we realized it.</review>

I’ve only been to this location a couple times and every single time.. my order was totally wrong and it was always the same girl at the window all those times, Not only is she extremely rude but if you just go back looking for your correct order then you’re getting an eye roll and an attitude. None of those times that my order was messed up did she ever apologize or anything! She acted like it was my fault that it was messed up. I tried looking for a name tag but she wasn’t wearing one but she is always wearing a purple T-shirt and she has dark hair. If I were a manager I would never allow someone with an attitude like that to be customer facing.</text>

<text>I made a last-minute decision to pull in to get something to eat at KFC and instantly pain looking at the menu I said I wanted to have both types of KFC bowls and the person that took the order was completely people friendly. I went to the window to pay and get my food and wow! What a delicious amount of food for such a little bit of price. If you want a quick delicious hot snack, KFC is definitely the place to go< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

It was a very good experience, the line was long but fast, they got all of our food correctly and fast which k appreciate ☺️ They took the necessary safety precautions they wore masks and the pickup was right at the door so you didn't even enter the store. Overall it was an excellent experience 😊<//Text>

This place is good like any other KFC, make sure to ask for ketchup when you order. Like that they know, it's been a few times when there wasn't any ketchup for my fries. Order their crispy chicken instead of the original, just taste better in my opinion.< /review>

I have given this place several chances. Ordered a 3 piece strips with 2 sides and bottled water. Price more than double what was on the menu. I know i ordered 2 different sides and bottled water, but double the 6.99. Then got home and 3 pieces of ?. I was glad when KFC came back to northwest but will not go there again.<//Review>

Loved it!!! 100%  so glad they're here on our side of town.   It was wonderful,  even picked up orders for some older family members to drop off curbside.   Everyone was very happy 😊

Only GPS will tell you exactly where it is. The other issue I have is that they offered me a combo meal and I assumed that it included a drink. I was wrong. They also forgot to include the spork with my meal.<//review>< gmap_id>

The KFC original recipe was great! Man alive, I love that flavor! However, the bag of our order-when opened, had no utensils, napkins, and 1 of the 2 meals ordered was wrong.  I will go back, & hopefully, they will improve.</Review>

<review>The KFC original recipe was great! Man alive, I love that flavor! However, the bag of our order-when opened, had no utensils, napkins, and 1 of the 2 meals ordered was wrong.  I will go back, & hopefully, they will improve.<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

There was 20 or so cars in line and it took about 25 minutes to get through it. The food was hot and the workers moved fast. It went as well as it could for being so busy</review>

<review>Chicken was fresh and moist. Not greasy.  Biscuits were undercooked and doughy.  Coleslaw had NO dressing in it. Dry.  Just the cabbage and onion. I called and let the mgr know so they could make sure product was being sent out correctly.  I friend went there the next day and the coleslaw was the same
Dry with no dressing.   Such a shame.</review>< pictures>

<text>So far only the drive thru is open and the line moved smoothly. I didn't get the side of mac & cheese I added to my order and couldn't find my receipt to see if I was charged...pretty sure I was. The meal was good but it seemed like the seasonings hadn't been mixed thoroughly and the batter was a bit thick in spots. Not really trying to complain; just want them to do well for all of us out here in Rosedale and Northwest Bako!! Just pay attention to your job and do it right❤️<//text>< pictures>

Missing side orders, no spoons/forks to go with order and the drive- through attendant was rude and possessed no quality customer relations/service.

Very disappointed.</Text>

< review>
Today we ordered the 8 piece meal extra crispy. The chicken was greasy probably due to the oil not to temperature when dropped in. The coleslaw had little to no dressing and the instant mashed potatoes were not completely mixed. The biscuits were so so, couldn't put my finger on what made them different. I know this KFC just recently opened but that shouldn't be an excuse for food that was not to KFC standards. Lots of people have been waiting for KFC to open and this is what we get.< /review>

Really good food! Only allowed to do drive thru or order from grubhub, which lets you pick up or deliver. This is most likely due to covid-19. Highly recommend it!< /review>

Yessica was efficient, professional, attentive and very communicative. She made things very easy for me. Best notary experience I have had in 10 years. I will definitely continue to use her and I recommend anyone with Notary needs to use Yessica. When you do, you will not use anyone else. Guaranteed.</text>

<user_name>Ricardo Soto< /user_name><review>I needed an immediate mobile notary service so I  called Yessica, right away and  was able to assist me a few hours later. She was very responsive, punctual, and nice! I've never worked with a notary before and didn't have much knowledge about the documentation I needed to fill out, but Yessica, sat down with me and explained it all.

I called last minute to get a document notarized for my business in Torrance CA and Yessica was able to get the job done. When I called she answered promptly and booked my appointment, she arrived on time, the price was fair and I found out she is bonded and insured which is a plus. I Highly recommend her services in the south bay.< /review>

I call and I ask if they will be able to sell me an IPhone 7 screen by its self instead of having them to fix it for me, and they Said yes.
After a week I call them again and I ask the same but they said no. I think they are not communicating the right way.
If it wouldn’t be because of that “no” I would it give it a 5 starts.<//Text>

<text>I gave the guy 40 dollars as a down payment to fix my computer screen he said he would order a part when I got pick it up here charges me 20 more and the computer screen isn't working and he didn't even put it in place he only put 6 screws in the back that I can take out with my finger and the part he was gonna order he never even put on and claimed that screen was a problem of the motherboard/graphics card and suggested me to another place..

this place is a robbery and money!!!!! he didn't even give me my receipt back...and plus he never called me to tell me about the computer problem and he took about 2 weeks to put 6 screws unbelievable my computer is in the exact condition I brought in except for the 6 screws that he added!!!!!
the owner is very dishonest.<//text>< GmapID>

< Review>
Was on Disney vacation and broke my IPhone 7+ screen. I found this place on google. Went there and was told I needed a new digitizer all though it was working correctly. Paid $100 and less than a week later the screen went dark on the lower right corner the phone now has a battery drain as I type this. It's slow unresponsive at times like I have a  Obama phone. The colors are dull and have no detail. Avoid this business at all cost or you will get cheap knockoff parts like I did. I was mislead by this nice sounding man on the phone when I called. And this was the upgraded screen with the digitizer built-in. I live 400 miles away or I would have taken it back and got my money back.</Review>

< review>
This guy replaced my IPhone 7 Plus screen And it broke within a week. The phone also was not working properly after I got the screen fixed and has not worked properly since. Huge waste of time and money. And I was told that there was no warranty on the work since the screen was cracked even after he charged me extra for the supposed screen protector.<//review>

<response>{'time': 1620060559600, 'text': "Josiah, replacing screen has nothing to do with power button. you can ask any tech. in regards of the screen responsiveness, I wish you mentioned this so I could've replaced it for you, beucase yes there is 2% chance of screen might be damage from the manufacture, and we give warranty on our work for 30 days."}</response>< text>
I wrote this review on yelp and felt I needed to write it here also. The owner of this place is dishonest and incompetent in my opinion. Here is my experience with FIxcell:

I cracked the screen on my iphone 4s and took it in to FIxcell. They replaced the screen for $80. When I got my phone back it worked fine for about 2 hours. Then the button that turns the phone on and off became unresponsive and my phone would not turn off. I took it back and the man working (who I think is the owner) told me that the phone was like that when I brought it in. I insisted that this was not true and he said okay and took the phone in the back and "fixed" the problem. I leave the store and about an hour later my screen completely turns black rendering my phone completely useless. I take it back and he tells me that the screen needs to be replaced AGAIN. So he replaces the screen a second time.

The screen on my phone freezes all the time now. The upper part of my screen is completely unresponsive. Instead of taking my phone back AGAIN, I'm just going to buy a new phone.

If you break the screen on your phone I would not recommend taking it to this place. It's a huge gamble. I've learned the hard way.</text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I have a Moto X cell phone on which the microphone stopped working. I took it in and spoke with Sam. He told me that because is was a newer model he'll first have to do some research to find out if parts are yet available or even if it can be fixed at all. This is because on some newer phones the microphone is part of the motherboard and only by replacing the motherboard can the problem be fixed (not cost effective). It turned out that it was part of the mother board. Sam was great to work with. Between himself and his technician I'm sure they spent at least an hour on this issue yet he charged me less than minimum wage. Now that is considerate and great service.</Review>< Pics>

<text>I called and asked how much to replace the charging port on my galaxy S5, he said $45.
When I get there he tells me there's a 99% chance of breaking the screen when replacing the port. He could have told me that over the phone. Then slaps a cheap charger down on the counter and tells me this is the best option. $25 for a crappy charger that won't charge my battery over 92%. Total waste of my time. This in my opinion was a bait and switch. Update: I found a place that fixed my phone for $85, they never mentioned the screen breaking or trying to sell me a charger. I think I'll report fixcell to the BBB.<//text><Name>Christina Draven< /Name>< response>

They have the absolute worst customer service that I have ever experienced. They were shut down because of the state mandate. They continued to charge my account every month until I reached out. They offered me a 2 month pause, but resumed charging my account right after. They were STILL CLOSED and unable to provide the services I paid for. Month after month I fought with them via email, because they would not give me a phone number. Every other gym that I was signed up with (F45, Orangetheory) had no problem cancelling my account without charging me hundreds of dollars. They sent me the same copy and pasted email over and over as if a robot was in charge of customer service. There are hundreds of other Pilates studios in San Diego and I would recommend going to any of them over this one. It’s amazing that this company is still in business with no regard for their customers.< /review><username>Sean Curtsinger< /username><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I love to support small businesses but this is NOT a business that deserves to even exist. I signed up for a 3 month trial pre pandemic thinking it’d only be 3 months. This company auto-renews your membership and continued to charge my credit card for a service I clearly wasn’t using. I tried calling them and only get email responses. They took so long to reply that I reached out to my credit card for guidance.

Lisa’s reply to me was “However it's now been brought to my attention that you have processed chargebacks which is very hurtful to us at this challenging time, and now it's out of my department, so I can't communicate further here.”

This company has been stealing from me for months during these hard times! Also, looked this business up on BBB they have a big fat F for a rating. Many other people have had the same issues I experienced.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

The Pilates Room Studios is so convenient with their multiple locations; this is one of the best features of membership. I had to run errands in downtown San Diego and I took a class at this location not only because of the convenience, but I also enjoy today's instructor (Merilee). The inside of the studio is open with adequate lighting with the large windows. There is also an option of two different types of reformers, so I utilized the one I was most comfortable with. The only con with this location is the parking. The area is great for dinning and shopping, but many tourists visit the area which can make the already limited parking even more challenging. The parking that is close to the studio is metered or a paid lot.<//review>

<review>This is an awesome studio! The teachers have been very nice and welcoming and I love that the studio is clean and well kept. The classes are challenging but not impossible which is great. It's convenient since they have multiple locations. My favorite class is the power pilates class since I love that dumbbells are included, it makes it for a better workout! Great studio!< /review>< response>

Their customer service or the system is really messed up. I purchased 3months program and actually I didn’t like it after I attend the first session. They told me they will give us the second month free but instead, kept charging me every month (it’s been 4th time already even though I signed up for only 3months). Plus, they weren’t able to open the studios due to pandemic and what ? You guys are charging me continuously?? Seriously? I don’t know what to say to be honest.

Have you guys ever read their terms before you sign up ? It’s ridiculous and they are trying to protect themselves so hard. Sign up if you are really into Pilates but it wasn’t for me.< /Text>

<text>This place has to be the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have told the studio to freeze my membership for two months now and they refused to respond to me in a timely manner or get back to me and instead they just go ahead and charge my card when it's not supposed to be charged I don't know how many times I have to contact this place call them send them e-mails when you do email them five different people get back to you if they respond back to you but statements that don't apply to me or that I've already answered. A month ago I had told them I wanted to freeze my membership they charged my card. I let it go the first time because I didn't give them enough notice and I told him the day before this month they done the same thing and I gave them plenty of notice repeatedly over and over again that I wanted my membership freeze and I do not want my car to be charged because I won't be coming there temporarily now I'm just going to cancel you guys are so many great Pilates studios in San Diego that I've been going to instead please do not go to the studio their instructors are pretty good but it's not worth the customer service has so you have to deal with just read the previous review< /text>< Rate>

I started to go to Pilates room because of a deal I received while walking around Little Italy for the Art walk. I can honestly say I'm so thankful I did! The studios are so amazing and the instructors make it fun while you work your butt off (pun intended)!! Thank you to the amazing team at the Little Italy location for stopping me on the street!</text>

I love The Pilates Room! I started going to classes about three weeks ago and I've found that everything is wonderful there! From the beautiful studios to the enthusiastic instructors and the exciting variety of classes, the Pilates Room is seriously an awesome place! In fact, I love it so much that just this afternoon, I committed to a 1 year membership! I'm looking forward to a year of great workouts!</Text>

< Review>
I ABSOLUTELY LOOOOVE the Pilates Room!! I just started going this month in preparation for my summer wedding and people have already started to notice a difference!!  Each instructor here will challenge you and make sure your form is correct!

I have tried a few other Pilates studios in town and have never fallen in love with any of the studios like this one!  They literally have classes every hour from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. with small class sizes.  Each class is a full body workout and is much more challenging than other studios I have tried.  I love how they incorporate free weights to work out arms while working out legs on the reformer.  I feel I get double the effects here because of the additional challenge with weights and balls.

I look forward to coming to each class!  Adriana, Esmeralda and Jen are amazing instructors!  They are very motivating and encouraging!

I LOVE everything about this place!! The ambiance, the challenge, the flexible schedule and the friendlies this studio hones!  It truly is a GREAT place that I LOVE coming to!</Review>

From my very first day at The Pilates Room, I felt super comfortable and like I was getting a great workout.  Some places do not take well to beginners but the instructors here make it a point to help you and make sure you are doing the moves properly.  No matter what the class, they push me and keep me motivated.  I also really like prepaying for classes and selecting them ahead of time.  It helps ensure that I am able to attend the classes that I want (and it helps me actually go!).  I wouldn't go anywhere else, I love it!<//text>

I really like my time at the Pilates Room. Having had a baby a few months ago, Pilates was the best way to start getting my body back. Just after 8 classes I have noticed a big difference in flexibility and in my lower body from how I was in the beginning. I love using the reformers to help me do things I cannot do just on my own. It has been a great experience and would recommend it to anyone to try, especially if you are just getting into exercizing.<//Text>

I purchased a 1-month trial package for The Pilates Room after 3 of my friends became members and started to get into awesome shape.  This is my third week at the Pilates Room and I already LOVE this place and always look forward to going to classes!  I have definitely started to see results already: my core is getting much stronger, my arms, legs and buns are feeling more toned, and I have more energy overall!  The instructors are wonderful - all are very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly, and small class sizes really allows you to receive personalized attention.  The facilities and equipment are kept in amazing and clean condition.  I also love the wide variety of classes offered by the studio which caters to people of varying ages and experience levels.  My 1-month trial isn't even over yet and I've already purchased the year-long membership -- I can't wait to see my personal results in a year from now!</text>

This place is great! I love working on the reformers, it looks easy, but once you are on it, it is definitely a good workout and tough, working all your muscles. I always leave feeling great. The instructors are well knowledged and push you (a good push), to keep going. Definitely recommend this place!</text>

Love the Pilates Room!  All of the instructors have been awesome, especially Stephanie and Tressa!  Everybody has been very welcoming to a new face.  I've been going for 2 weeks and I'm already seeing results.  I look forward to each class.  Thanks, ladies of the Pilates Room!</Text>

<Review>I love doing any kind of physical activity that kicks my butt, and The Pilates Room does just that! I've never enjoyed burning abs and buns so much in my life. The rooms are super clean, the instrauctors are great, and the way you feel after every class is amazing. It hurts so good but of course you go at your own pace and push yourself as hard as you want. The best Pilates Studio by far =)</Review><gmapID>0x80d954b275aa7731:0x69cb082579d58185<//gmapID><user_name>Niki Larracas</user_name>< time>

My first time trying Pilates was a few weeks ago and I've really enjoyed each time I've been. There is an excellent variety of classes, they are offered at flexible times, and each instructor I've had has been fabulous and supportive! I highly recommend any first timers to try The Pilates Room!< /Review>

The Pilates Room is a great way to get fit for summer! Everyone is really friendly and knows what they are doing. There are a variety of classes, so you are bound to find something you really enjoy. I really like reformer all levels, but I prefer the smaller classes because you get more of an individualized experience. That being said, if this is your first time doing pilates I would start with reformer beginners.<//review>

Owner never gets back to you and I called many times and left voicemails. Also, online support is in India and their communication skills are poor, not can they access your account 'LIVE".

All of the instructors are friendly, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable about pilates. I feel fantastic after every class.  There is a wide variety classes and very conducive to my schedule. Even though I go to some of the same classes, they are rarely the same.  Challenging my body and mind. I am on the computer all day, so signing up for classes is easy online.< /text>

Dedication pays off! Katia and the Pilates Crew give you the energy and drive you need to show up and shape up with a SMILE!   Routine for each of the classes is never exactly the same, I like this.  Keeps me interested and engaged.  Instruction is clear and detailed, and the instructors are always watching to make sure you are in "form".  This is the best shape and health that I have been in, ever.  My confidence and shine is definitely higher.  Thank you Pilates Room!!! xoxo, K<//Text>

<Date>1354819108951< /Date><Rating>2</Rating><Review>I am unhappy with a misleading promotion they were advertising. I travel often with work and wanted to try out the special for $39 for 8 classes - this was clearly asked when I went in to purchase.

After being on the road for almost three weeks I attempted to schedule a second class, after only using 1 of the 8 total I had bought. They told me it expired but I could pay more to extend the offer, $20 additionally.

I feel they were not honest and when I tried to contact them on the phone it was nearly impossible. They don't post a working phone number and when I emailed asking for a number to call them on - the owner replied and said they don't answer the phone and email is better. Poor customer service.

This was a waste of time and money. I only used 1 of the 8 classes and definitely didn't get want I paid for or a reasonable management to handle the issue. Very disappointed.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>I've been attending the Pilates Room Mission Gorge location going on three weeks now and I am in love! I'm new to the reformer but I have to say I was sold after the first day. I'm not one to enjoy the gym and so I thought I would try out Pilates. I absolutely love the variety in classes and instructors. I'm not a morning person by any means, but I've been enjoying morning workouts at the Pilates Room. It gets me out of my bed, wakes me up, and leaves me energized for the rest of the day. And the best part is it's such a great workout. I was barely able to walk for two days after trying a jump power class. Thank you Pilates Room!<//text>< name>

I am absolutely addicted to this Pilates Room. I have tried many studios in San Diego, and I finally found a home at the Little Italy Studio. It kicks my butt every time. It is a love hate relationship  because it actually works me out and I get a good sweat. I'm not writing a review just because. I truly appreciate this studio and will be a member for as long as they are open!!!! - Word<//review>

I love the new College/Mission Gorge Pilates Room.  I was a little worried about whipping my bad back into shape, as yoga aggravated it. After only 2 classes I was hooked! This is the best thing I could ever do for my broken body! I am already feeling the core strengthened beyond belief.  The teachers are so kind and encouraging. One day I will have a body like them!! Thanks for giving me an outlet that works for me.  I know if I keep up with it I will stronger and happier for the rest of my life!

The Pilates Room is amazing, I feel the stronger just after 3 classes!  The instructors are very careful about injuries and preventing any.  I have shoulder problems and each instructor has paid careful attention.  The studio is clean and organized.  I absolutely love the workout.

The pilates instructors are amazing; however the customer service is horrendous. With the new year my account was cancelled and membership rate cancelled and I have emailed the support team multiple times with one response to sign up for a new membership with a 50$ increase in rate. This experience has been the worst customer service I have experienced. I do not recommend this studio due to the horrible customer service.

If the office sees this review, please feel free to finally contact me.< /Text>

Does anyone have a physical address and/or phone number that they've been successful with? My emails are just spitting back automated replies. Time to call the BBB on this place!<//Review>

<review>I rate this place higher if I could!!! I tried their 1 month trial and each time i've attended one of the classes it's continued to exceed my expectations.  I've taken both Sarah and Katia's classes and they are not only nice, but they're also encouraging and patient making sure everyone is comfortable with the moves.  Best workout, Best studio!! Victoria at the front desk is always very pleasant too!!! I highly recommend this place.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80d954b275aa7731:0x69cb082579d58185< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Yay!! Finally closer to my home :0)) THE BEST PILATES GYM!!! The studio is very clean and the instructors are excellent. As a beginner I wasn't made to feel that I was keeping the class behind (like other places).  I am looking forward to seeing my results and even thinking of taking the instructor course!  Keep up the good work!<//Review>< pictures>

<username>Katherine Wilson</username><review>I have finally found a workout method I enjoy! The Pilates Studio is amazing. It offers classes that accomodate even the busiest person's schedule. Signing up online is easy and always guarantees a spot in the class. The instructors are super motivational, the music is awesome, and the variety of classes keeps things interesting. In all the different types of workouts I have done in my life, pilates has the most beneficial results. The studios are always clean and the owner is really nice and cares about her clients. I would 100% give this studio 5 stars!</review><Date>1363285907811<//Date>< user>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><text>I had never done pilates before, but as an avid marathoner and part time triathlete, I thought it would be a good balance. I was surprisingly shocked at how challenging the classes were, in a very good way. Not only was it at times cardio, but using those tiny little muscles I never get to. With the amount of diverse classes available, there is a class for everyone, beginner to advance. The facility was clean and neat and the instructors very friendly and helpful.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>THe instructors are awesome! I got a $39 groupon that entitled 8-classes. However, I needed to finish the classes within a month before they expired. Luckily, I live right near by and was able to do all 8 classes in no time. I really enjoyed the reformer jump class. The instructor kicked our butt's. The only area I hope the owner can improve on is sometimes the lady in front checking everyone in is not very upbeat. Would be nice to have someone a bit more cheerful. All-in-all I had a great experience at the Pilates Room and will be going back.</Review>< time>

<Review>I came to the Pilates Room after I got a groupon, and I can say that it was one of the better investments in a groupon that I've made.  I loved waking up on Saturday and Sunday morning and running down to the studio for a reformer class.  Or getting of work on a Wednesday and Thursday and hopping over to help unwind from a long day.  It was perfect to start or end my day.  I love going here, and sincerely hope to spend more time in their studio.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>The Pilates Room is a great place to get both a challenging and fun workout. I love that you can sign up for classes online--it's so convenient! The facilities are clean and attractive; they have you wipe down the machines at the end of class which keeps everything nice and clean. Staff is professional and friendly! Each class that I've been to has been amazing, leaving me energized at the end. You definitely feel the workouts the next day, but it's totally worth it. After a few sessions I already feel that I'm developing muscles in my back and obliques, which are hard for me to address in my other activities (running and biking). I'm currently training for a sprint triathlon event in June, so pilates is great cross-training--providing both a cardio and strength-training workout. Classes are never dull, and they're constantly changing things up!<//Text>< UserId.>

Warm, friendly & knwledgable instructors=check. Fun, challenging, never boring or repetitive workout=check. Tons of classes to choose from, to fit even the busiest schedules & fitness levels=check. I can go on and on forever abt how wonderful The Pilates Room is but the bottom line is YOU have to try it for yourself to find out. You will be glad you did!

Got a group on for $29 for 8 classes. You have to use all the classes in a 30 day period. The instructors are great and you get a really good workout. Reformer Pilates was new to me, but now it's something I will continue!< /text>

THe instructors are awesome! I got a $29 groupon that entitled 8-classes.
I did 4 classes in a week.
I really enjoyed the reformer jump and trapeze class :)
Also, Claudia and Jessica at the front desk are very friendly.</text>

< Review>
I love the Pilates Room! For working out, I have always practiced Yoga and running for cardio. I have been looking for something to change up my workout routine and give me the body I have always wanted. I am only on my second week of classes, but the power buns and abs class made me use muscles I did not even know existed. The EXO cardio was high intensity and gave me an amazing interval training workout.  The instructors are very helpful and friendly, but the most amazing part is that the hour goes by so quickly, for the first time working out is fun! Thanks!</Review>

I signed up for the 1 month trial and I'm hooked. Love the class sizes, the instuctors, the multiple classes in the evening, and of course pilates! I think its a great work out and body toner. I've only tried the reformer classes but there is also Exo chair, jump, power... so many options, there's bound to be something you'll enjoy.Highly recommend!</Review>

<Review>Now i am not a fitness junkie nor am i a natural athlete.  So when i signed up for their trial period what a surprise was it for me that i signed up for a year membership. I absolutely love this studio.  I feel that i have finally found my "workout". But don't get me wrong, pilates is not easy whatsoever.  Literally after each of the classes at The Pilates Studio i automatically feel sore, which is amazing because i know i am burning away all those burgers, etc. that i should have not eaten.  The studio is separated by three rooms by color. I have only taken classes in the champagne and orange room and both are clean and spacious.  They are located on Kettner and people passing by do have a tendency to just stare in while you work out but once you are in the zone its not a problem. Let those creepers just creep. Tips: plan to come early for parking (horrible in little italy) and for your "spot" on one of their machines.</Review>< pictures>

And they have so many difference classes all day, multiple ones at the same time going on and very different variety of classes from traditional pilates to pilates mix that uses other equipments. And their jump power is amazing and the instructors are all very helpful and help adjust to your comfort level! Thanks Pilates Room!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I recently bought a Groupon and have never taken Pilates. After my first class I was hooked. The classes are challenging and you really see a difference in your body after doing it. I love the Pilates Room, this is a great place to start if you have never done pilates. The staff is very friendly.</review>

Awesome place. A coworker told me about this place so I checked it out.  Im glad I tried it. I have enjoyed pilatez since the first class.  They have different classes and different levels. The classes are small, which gives the instructors time to make sure you are in the righy position and technique. The classes are offered everday. During the week start at 6am until 8pm weekends 8am until noon. I signed up for a year membership after the 2nd week. I cant see myself not doing pilates.</Text>

<GmapID>0x809ac7f243fb94ef:0xff926572b273a048<//GmapID><Text>I found Tea 18 on Elk Grove, Ca by accident.  I'm very glad I did.  The staff has always been very helpful and polite.  And they know their drinks.

This being the first time here I did not know what drinks they had to offer.  So I did what I normally do, I let the person taking the order to "surprise me".  This has allowed me to try different drinks every time I visit.

And let me tell you the drinks are simply amazing.  Every single one of them have been a great experience.

Not only do they offer a great variety of tasty drinks, they also have some cool features.  Tea 18 has free WI-FI and plenty of sitting areas.  A cool dry wall, and games area where you can grab a game and kids can find a game or a puzzle to pass the time.  As mention above the staff has been nothing but nice to me.  A good friendly atmosphere all around.

If you are in the Elk Grove Area and would like to try some unique flavorful drinks, stop by TEA 18 on 10051 Bruceville Rd, Elk Grove, CA< /Text>< userid>

Their tea is superb! Never too bitter or watery and some of their teas are brewed per cup. I like the care that goes into each individual cup and come here frequently now :) there’s a lot of boba places in the vicinity but if I’m looking for more traditional teas, this is always a great go to place!< /Review>

Milk tea was amazing, 25% was still on more sugary side. The whole place, seating arrangement was nice and had a good feel to it. Rest rooms were clean.</text>

Didnt expect the drinks to be as good as they were. I really like them good selection of drinks. Food needs to be expanded on. But great atmosphere and staff is friendly. Recommend drinks are best. Cant wait to go back</review>

I had a hokkaido milk tea with egg pudding  and a matcha green tea with boba. I was not disappointed. The  boba was perfect and the service relatively fast considering the amount of people that were in front of us. This is an awesome boba place and I would recommend.< /text>

Very disappointed now. I was a daily visitor until the boba got stale, the straws got too small for the bobas and the music got less family friendly.  Too bad because it was may favorite place.  I'll update the review pending improvement.</Review>

It's dirty inside.  Especially the oven where you pick up your internet order,  OMG, it's FILTHY DIRTY!  NOT to mention,  all the dirty fingerprints all over the metal.  It's absolutely gross. You can totally tell they haven't wiped that thing down in god knows how long.  The overall experience i would give 2 stars. Get a gallon of bleach,  and get those young kids to cleaning,  cause it's NASTY DIRTY.<//text>

< Review>
The pizza was nothing like yhe commercial. I ordered the double pepperoni double cheese and I ended up giving it to my dog. It was dry. Had no flavor. Honesty the box it came out of probably had more taste. Won't go back again. Little Caesars should focus more on flavor and fresh ingredients...less on marketing.</Review>

They have a new machine in the front lobby that allows you to pre purchase a tasty pizza and have it ready to pick up when you arrive. Make sure to pre pay via the app and add your favorite toppings before you head into the store so it's hot and fresh. You can even order the Italian cheese bread as well for take out!<//Review>

I will never go back to this place ever. Very slow service looks like the employees are teen agers messing around. One employee i saw running his finger through his hair and not washing them before making pizzas. Very disgusting dirty place.< /review>

Finally got them to place my order then ignored me for 20 mins. Then told me I was only there 10 mins so had to show receipt it had been over 20. Female manager useless. Saw my order in the holder but said not mine for another customer who wasnt there. Hey Einstein give it to me since they aren't here yet and give them mine!

<review>Staff are mostly younger in age, maybe 18-22 range and they're super rude. I even went out of my way to continue to be polite, even after they were super bitchy to me already and even after me still trying to be polite, they continued to be super rude. I was really irritated but I was with my baby girl so I just smiled, thanked them and left.< /review><user_id>111324459280650367235</user_id></record></dataset><record>

For the past 2 months ive noticed this place seems to always be otta control and there is this rude manager there who yells at her employees, when I can see there just doing there best I think they called her Kim or something idk but I would never work at that place that's forsure. There is a whole different crew than there was just 2 months ago, they must of realized to get outta there and I agree with them!</Text>

We got a 3 meat pizza on Saturday and my husband was the only one who ate this pizza, he got food poisoning from it and has been sick for 4 days. So we recommend not to get the 3 meat pizza,</text>

This location sucks all the way around!!! NEVER is the Deep Dish HOT n READY!?! Then not to mention the rude unhappy complaining all the time employee's... if u don't like your job then quite do something else... but then u got to wait 10 mins to be helped while employee's are in the back talking and there is no one else in the store but me?!!! This place is ran like a joke... I will stop coming to this location... hopefully the next one does alot better...js #HotnReadyMyAss< /Text>

Don`t the cheese bread comes with marinara sauce? I did not want to argue  with this moody 20 year old. I said  this " Can i get the cheese bread" He said " *sigh* its going to be 10 minutes" I said " well you gotta start at some point". Man this kid was annoying. He looked at me with an attitude in my mind I was like don`t pay attention to me pay attention at what you are doing. He gave me the box he said here have a good day and I`m like yeah uh huh whatever and I slammed that door. The cheese bread tasted like a cheese pizza with no sauce lol it was ok.Note:  This happened like at 11am. It looked like he did`nt get his coffee hahahaha. His braces were clear and his ears were pierced.<//Review>

They must have gotten rid of the rude ones, but I'm satisfied with the service. Very young and very professional.<//review>

There is absolutely nothing on the menu that isn't scrumptious.  I recommend Babycakes to everyone that asks me for bakery.</Text>

I stumbled across this place when walking by! I walked in and saw a beautiful display of marvelous cupcakes and other baked treats! I orded the Blood Orange, Carrot cake, salted Carmel and Chocolate mousse I believe. All were delicious but I would like to say, not sure if maybe it  was sitting on the display for a while but the salted caramel was not as fresh tasting as the others. Besides that everything was delicious!< /Text>

<review>I am not from the area and was looking for some bolillos, walked into the "bakery" but the cupcakes looked pretty so I bought two. One was lemon,  beautiful but- save your money, it tasted like any box cake from the grocery store.  :/  The second was a Tres Leches -NO LECHEs, not evan One!!! Tasted like vanilla cake :/  Don't taste as good as they look.</review>< time>

Eclectic bakery and coffee shop. They offer a variety of Cupcakes and coffees. They did forget some of our order and we had to ask for it again. It wasn’t very busy so I’m not sure what happened here. They offer a free treat on your birthday. ID must be shown and this is only good for the day of your birthday is what we were told. Nice place for a sweet treat. Overall a little pricey for what it is.< /Text>

< Review>
Omg. Words cannot describe how elegant, beautiful, DELICIOUS, and perfect our wedding cake was. We just got married on 10/10, and ever since the beginning, Babycakes was always there. The communication was so great, which is a huge deal!! I NEVER worried. Since the tasting, we just knew it was you who we wanted to make our day even better. Everyone loved the Marble Bianca cake, and WOWED over how it looked. Did I cry when I saw it? You bet I did- it was even better than I dreamed of. Thank you ALL, you are all so talented, listened to exactly what we wanted it to look like, and all I can say now is thank you. Thank you all so much, I will again and again recommend you, babycakes.<//Review>

Very pleased with my experience with Babycakes! My consult request was responded to quickly. Cassie was great with helping me choose the design and pricing of my cake. We chose a baby shark theme and strawberry short cake for my sons first birthday. It was beautiful and more importantly - delicious! I will gladly use their services for any other treats while I am in the area!<//review>

<Review>Absolutely recommend for dessert & event cakes. We worked with Tanya in booking Babycakes for our wedding cake and are absolutely pleased with our decision. We samples several local cakes that were supposedly more well-known in the wedding industry, but nothing even came close. The flavor of the cakes is amazing, the price was great, ordering/delivery were flawless. I wouldnt change a thing. I love the fact that we can visit Babycakes any day and grab cupcakes that are the same flavors we selected for our wedding cake - easy way to reminisce.

We showed Babycakes a picture of an idea we had for the cake design. They replicated with ease and no worries at all. When we discovered how great the flavors were during our sampling, we brought a few cupcakes home for friends/family to sample and weight-in. They all agreed that the flavors were amazing.< /Review>< Response>

I'm always impressed with babycakes and have never had a bad experience here. Their cupcakes and other desserts are perfect because they're not overly sweet. I usually hate frosting on cupcakes because it's too sweet, but here their frosting is amazing because it's perfectly sweetened without ruining the flavor of the cupcake. And I can't forget their amazing coffee they have! Can't wait to keep on coming back for more desserts and coffee dates!< /text>

I can't say enough. We had stumbled across this place after having lunch not far from here, GREAT cupcake selection. Highly recommend stopping by for a delicious treat, maybe sit outside and watch the world go by.

If you like unique and different tastes of cakes, this is a must.</text>

This was my first time at this location. It's just the next street over from my grandmas house, so I will be coming back. My family and tried  the chocoholic, the tres leches cupcake, the black bottom, the cinnamon cookie, and the vegan brownie.They were all good! The cupcakes always taste fresh and decadent. I ate mine too quick to take a picture, but I highly recommend this bakery. Cassie was very friendly and helpful. Thank you!<//Text>

Last year I bought a (small size) $38 cream cheese (and another flavor, cant remember) birthday cake. In LOVE with DECOR of cake and the flavor (i think it was) cream cheese. This cake was Tres leche I didn't like it. Thought it wasn't moist enough to be a tres leche. $$ pricey but Affordable</review>

Really cool spot right in the center of hillcrest, great find to be honest. Im a pastry fanatic and this place has many pastries to fill that sweet tooth void. I love the quality and presentation, great seating outdoor and nice views. Great cupcakes for any event or just to surprise your coworkers.</text>

Stopped by upon arriving in San Diego in search of a bakery for my son's wedding. We tried two cupcakes which were okay. The young woman behind the counter was lovely to work with, but the product was not as good as I expected after reading the reviews. I found the cupcakes to be a bit too heavy.< /review>

Great place. Come on a Taco Tuesday and you will not be disappointed, especially during Happy Hour from 5-8pm, awesome deals on great tasting tacos and drinks. ALSO... wonderful back garden patio available for private events. Held my birthday party here and I couldn't have been happier, the price was perfect and the food was amazing.</Review>

We had an amazing wedding cake made with blood oranges and berries. Our cake was pristine and the cake tasting was divine. Everyone is still raving about it a week after our wedding. I would highly recommend Babycakes to anyone in the area looking for great value, professionalism, and taste.<//text>

Pricier cupcakes at $3 each but the flavors are unique and the cakes are always moist. I have only had the cupcakes but they also have cheesecake along with other sweet treats. The owners are friendly and make pretty designs on your plate with sweet syrup once you order it. My favorite cupcakes are the pistachio and passion fruit guava flavored ones. It's been a while since I've been back but nothing has ever disappointed any time I went. There is outdoor patio seating as well as bar seating. It's the one place where you can knife and fork your cupcakes just to enjoy the ambiance of the place.< /Review>

We needed to take dessert to a gathering, and decided to try out the cupcakes at Babycakes. They were a hit! They had just the right amount of sweetness that I didn't need a glass of water to swallow the rest down.< /Text>

Greta desert selection, but it can be a little intimidating! I only wish that the guy at the register had been a little more helpful in terms of knowing more about the desserts. But, the atmosphere is incredibly warm and inviting and I really love the coziness. The separate bar area is a nice touch as well</Review>

OMG, Babycakes never fails. My baby wanted a unicorn cake and boy did they deliver. The look was magical and the taste an explosion in our mouths. It wasn't too sweet, so I don't have kids running around hyped up on sugar. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.</Text>

Been here a couple of times and overall it's a great place for dessert. The cupcakes aren't overly sweet, which makes it easy to eat the whole thing.  First time at BabyCakes I had a blood orange cupcake, and it was perfect. I tried the peanut butter cupcake the second time and it was still good but a little dry. There are a few parking spots in the front, so be prepared to search for parking.< /Review>

Been here a few times for friends birthdays at night. The bakery stuff is pretty good. Bar makes decent drinks. Alcohol and dessert, pretty good by themselves .. Awesome when you can get both. Outside area is good for large groups.</review>

Babycakes is a great option for weekend brunch!  It's always easy to get a table and as a previous reviewer mentioned, service is colorful!  The staff couldn't be more spirited and   nice!  I normally get one of their egg dishes but end up eating my boyfriend's red velvet pancakes which are to die for!  And their cupcakes rock!  Fun and cute decor make this a Hillcrest gem!  We love it there!<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>This is sort of a must when we visit Hillcrest. The cupcakes are delicious and fancy. If you're craving chocolate with a little fruit I recommend the Black Bottom which is chocolate cake with a rich vanilla cream cheese and chocolate chip frosting/filling and a bit of raspberry in the center. My family is in love with the blood orange cupcake. But there's really no wrong way to go here. The bar is also good but the cupcakes really steal the show.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This is my last stop when I go shopping around the area. I save the best for last. This where I go whenever I have a sweet tooth, and a cupcake is exactly what would cure it. They offer a variety of mouthwatering & creative cupcake flavors from oreos, blood orange, pistachios, to peanut butter. However, you can also stop here for brunch and lunch. I like here to catch up with friends, or a have a quiet moment with me and my book.<//text>

<text>Cupcakes, french fries, and adult beverages! Can't get much better than that! I  love this place. When walking up it looks like a little house. Baby cakes has a nice outside eating area and a bar over on the side. Of course parking in terrible because it is Hillcrest. If you are lucky you might get one of the 4 spots right in front. Sundays are crazy! It's packed with people like a day club! The cupcakes are delicious. Very creative with flavors. Can't get enough!</text><rate>5</rate><gmap_id>0x80d954dab5ad6967:0x911d8aee6c6903ba< /gmap_id>< date>

<Review>During the day there is a mellow energy here which makes every seem very relaxing.  The perfect way to appreciate the sweet or savory items on the menu.  I'll tell you what though, I was there on a Sunday afternoon when all of a sudden a DJ & bar was set-up out front and groups of people started walking up creating a lively sunny SD party.  So no matter what type of vibe you are looking for it seems to me that Babycakes finds one way or another to bring it.< /Review><gmapID>0x80d954dab5ad6967:0x911d8aee6c6903ba<//gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures><date>1342112724958</date><rating>4<//rating></record></dataset><record>

For the fourth time, the team at Babycakes, Hillcrest has created a beautiful, fun, delicious and memorable cake for my son's birthday party. We won't go anywhere else for cakes or cupcakes. This team is simply the best. Would highly, highly recommend.</Review>

Beautiful cupcakes but they tasted cloyingly sweet with no richness. It wasn't like other cupcake boutiques where there seems to be some depth of flavor that warrants the price. Hope to give this place a second (really, like fourth) chance.</Text>

<text>I used to really enjoy Babycakes, but I feel like the quality has gone down since the move. The plain vanilla and chocolate cakes were dry, tough, and seemingly old. I still like the Black Bottom and Babycakes flavors, but I was kind of disappointed with the other cupcakes I got.<//text></record></dataset><record>

This place makes them in refreshing flavors as well as the tradition red velvet, chocolate, and vanilla.  We come here and we switch up our orders because you really do want to try it all.<//Review>< Pictures>

Breakfast was ok. The food was bland but the atmosphere was fun. I liked the local authentic vibes but if you're looking for breakfast it was average. The good reviews are for the desert options, not breakfast. If you can't get in to Snooze or Hash House this place wasn't crowded but what you pay for the meal you get was kind of high and not really worth it. Also they played Coldplay. Con for me, but hey, if you're into that.<//Review>

<Text>Their cupcakes are the best in the Hillcrest/North Park/University Heights area, but not the best overall.  The staff is really friendly and the service is good.  Parking is really hard to get at their location.  So if you can't get the parking space up front, I would recommend that you skip it.  If available, then stop by for a cupcake!<//Text>< user_id>

The service is awesome! you are greeted as you enter the door. The tall blonde guy that helped us today around lunch time was amazing, very patient. I ordered a Spinach cranberry and chicken salad that was delicious and a creme brulee cheesecake. I cant wait to go back!</Review>

<text>It was my birthday yesterday and my friends and I went to the September Birthday Bash. It was such a great time! From the ambience to their iced hazelnut mocha with almondmilk latte paired with a peanut butter cupcake to each and every one of the staff being very helpful, courteous and efficient, I was very impressed and satiated with how things unfolded. Plus, Madonna was bumpin' through the speakers! Thank you for putting on a great event!<//text>< Pics>

<text>I. LOVE. BABYCAKES!!! There are so many flavors to choose from it always takes me forever to decide on a couple, so I wind up buying four or five. If they ever made a 6-foot tall cupcake, I would marry it. Babycakes' owner would be invited to be the Best Man.</text>< Pics>

<Text>4.5 is my official value. I only was able to eat one cup cake. However, that cupcake is one of the best cupcakes I have eaten in years.  All that know me knows that is a compljment. I was there for pride, no cover, and I hope they keep it that way. We all enjoyed time there before going to a larger dance floor. Fantastic cupcakes great people and a wonderful enviroment.  Keep those cupcakes coming!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>The cupcakes are normally pretty great don't know this time, but the customer service isn't worth the cost. Yesterday's visit for example... I discussed with the only 2 employees on duty, my TREE NUT ALLERGY (notice the emphasis).  Not only did we discuss this, but a fu**ing carrot cake cupcake ends up in the same packaging as my tres leches cupcake, walnuts and all!  Now why in the ever loving hell would I request an allergy ridden cupcake that we just had a conversation about?  I didn't request it!< /Text>< pics>

My husband and I just finished two cupcakes that were pretty horrible. We were excited about the experience based on the reviews, but there's no way I could make myself eat here again. The cake was dry and not flavorful, the icing was average. Won't be back.</review>

I don't understand a place that only makes two things and makes them both poorly. The cakes are not made on site and it shows. They have languished in the case and are not fresh. The people working behind the counter don't have the requisite knowledge to explain their products and do not know how to operate their espresso machine properly. The crumb of the cupcake is too loose, the icing hard and old and the coffee weak and lacking crema and technique. A poor choice for dessert or coffee. Hopefully they will close soon and someone with talent who cares about their product will take their place.< /Text>

Love this place! Everyone who works here is so nice! Cute place and the cupcakes are delicious! One of my favorites is the creme de leche. Their Mexican mochas are amazing too! Always go for lunch or snacks, but I hear the drinks and weekends are a fun time too!<//Text>

The food is great and the drinks are good the staff is great but the GM is a creep. GM follows me around and makes me feel very uneasy while there. I feel like he think I am there to steal something the way he keeps looking at me. Plus he is always telling people that knows me I am there.  Today Janurary 24 at 345 pm I was there and he kept walking around me. It is really creepy and rude. I was there less than 5 minutes and I had to leave. I was so creeped out because of the GM.< /Review>

The cupcakes are to die for. If you go for a drink there it's great too. Like Sundays.</review>

A bar and cupcake place, can't beat that combo.  Best bets are the brunch served on weekends, the red velvet pancake and if you order bar bites, the quesadilla is amazing.  Off the menu at Babycakes is the Quesadilla with pulled pork.  OMG!<//Text>

First impression is that the store is huge.  Had tons of stuff and could probably find everything you need.  The store is nestled in a shopping center and has a few good places to eat next door.  There is a Starbucks inside and one outside too.< /Review>

The store is very clean and well-kept. The cashiers are very nice, well groomed, professional  with a pleasant smile on their faces. The tenor of their voice matches the same. But the stairway could use a good hot steam blasting. Therefore, only 4 stars< /Review>

<review>Always clean but since COVID started, they still haven’t found a way to clearly direct customers when they’re ready for checkout. Come on Safeway, duck tape the arrows on the floor or put up a small printed sign that indicates where the line starts.

Great store but the parking for the handicap is to far from the store. My father was able to walk to the store but I had to drive to the front of the store to pick him up. The car was to far away to walk back. Handicap parking should be in front of the store.<//Review>

Alma who works in the Seafood department is INCREDIBLE. She keeps the display clean, organized. And most import, keeping the seafood  fresh. Alma's selections of seafood is  better than any other Safeway Ive visited. Rockridge Safeway can now compete with Berkeley Bowl's seafood department.<//review>

<Review>Better than the other Safeway on Grand. The deli service is terrible. Indescribably slow. There was no line and I still had to wait five minutes for service.<//Review>< UserId.>

Be ready to wait in line...
New rules for the neighborhood.
Line up outside before entering mask up, wipe down your carts. Be nice to each other.

The butcher,the clerks the grocers they are our neighbors!
Community Safeway remember that! We all live together and work together and shop together...
Legit you get dirty looks when you go up to the Broadway Safeway.< /text>

<Text>Awful people making multiple lines for the same register, staff doesn't direct people. Is not the long lines that bothered me, is the lack of direction by staff , someone started arguing with me and I had to go to the self check out just to avoid confrontation and security was nowhere to be found.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

If you can shop in the store it's great. Curbside pickup of an online order took 8 hours to fill, and many items that I ordered apparently were NOT available. Ordering online delivery is time consuming, their app wants you to select alternatives on many items. You don't know what you're going to get! Though it's delivered in the time slot you select.< /Review>

I started shopping here a few months ago, regularly. The store has been here for centuries but I did not shop there often. Then the unexpected happened and now I go in regularly hoping to see the unexpected as often as possible. Literally makes my day every time.< /Review>

This is my neighborhood Safeway.
I guess for most things they are all about the same.  I go to this one for convenience and selection.  I think it is better stocked than the ones on College or Grand, nearby.

It usually has a good selection of organic products and special diet supplies.

Security around Covid 19 is lax.  They usually are out of wipes and sanitizer by the doors.
Security themselves walk around with their noses over their masks.</Text>

<Review>The Drive Up and Go service has been very poor and disorganized the last couple weeks. It used to just take a couple minutes and they brought out everything they had. The last couple weeks has taken twenty minutes each time and one time they left half my things in the store. Also their phone number to call listed on the sign just rings and rings with no answer and no sign telling people to call the store main number instead.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1617487440378, 'text': "Hi Carl, we're sorry to hear about the poor experience you have had while utilizing our Drive Up and Go service.

Typical California based supermarket. Covid-19 virus precautions implement. Monitoring number of shoppers admitted to the store, as well as face mask requirements and social distancing at checkout. This store is still experiencing some shortages which mystifies me after 9 months with this virus<//text>

<Text>This is newly built Safeway, so it's really nice and clean. It has all the stuff every other Safeway has. Plenty of parking in the lot, that's never an issue. My only gripe with it is prices. Safeway in general is more expensive than other grocery stores, but it's close to home and convenient.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>During Covid it's a mess. They don't limit the number of shoppers, it's crowded, and the last two times I was there they had only one cashier open -- the lines went down the aisle and wrapped around along the pharmacy. It took so long to get out of there that by the end I was in tears, both times. Their selection is not bad, and the staff at the pharmacy is nice, that's the only reason for the 3 stars instead of 1. I was there around 3:30, if you have to go I'd recommend earlier in the morning, or try Trader Joe's instead.</Review>< rating>

Placed a "drive up and go" order which was supposed to be ready at 3pm. I never was notified that it was ready. I called the next day. I was told that Safeway"fell behind" the previous day and that my order has been cancelled. I should have been informed, but was not.< /Review>

#COVID19
Safeway gave me an incomplete order and I came back to retrieve the rest of the items. I gave my name and order number SIX (6) times, and I’m still waiting for my order. It has been over an hour... Update: It’s 7:16 PM, Update: 7:45, still no groceries

I have been doing my due diligence on NOT going up to the employees and waiting in the car. Some patrons have NOT been doing that! We are all trying our best here, and I’ve been patient with others in mind.

With that said, I have some points of improvement (I really ought to go to logistics management...). People that have been following me for a while know this is my MO:

1) The number on the parking garage for grocery pickups needs to work.
—what is the point of telling customers to call this number if no one answers?

2) You need to focus on hiring and training ESPECIALLY during this digital age!
—Safeway corporate needs to have a division or task force that emphasizes mobile pickup.
—This is the best policy with less exposure and less anxiety for shoppers and workers alike.
—Why would you want people coming into the store if you have a way to mitigate the increase of traffic?

3) Communicate with your customers! I tell my students this mantra, “communicate communicate communicate!”  Safeway, if you cannot make a deadline, tell your customers that and give them another time! It’ll be frustrating, but if it helps with keeping things stocked, your employees less susceptible to verbal abuse, and your customers in the “know”...those are all great ways to build up rapport in the community!</Review>

<Text>Only 3 stars because I walked the length of the entire store, on. crutches and didn't see any identifiable Safeway staff to answer a question. Having said this, store is clean, shelves stocked, meat area did not have an offensive odor, checkers friendly and efficient. Good store, where was staff??< /Text>< Pics>

Nice overall store.    Don’t use their online ordering.    Not only did they silently drop the delivery to your car, but they completely lost our order.   Long story short, it would have been two times faster to buy it myself.< /review>

Don't bother trying to get baby formula here. It's locked behind a glass door. You will wait forever at customer service to get someone to unlock it. Then that person will not show up to unlock it. It's happened to me three times now. Go to Target, they will just allow you to buy it without jumping though hoops.<//review>

Best Safeway in Oakland in my opinion. Will go out of my way to go here. I always find parking on the top as well, there is a ramp on the side to access the top. I also use the Safeway app and get coupons and rewards. Cheaper than most grocery stores in Oakland and has a big selection.< /Text>

It is sad that Safeway really doesn't respect how hard it is to keep groceries affordable.  Bought 6 items.  Regular cost was $35.  I had to shop for on sale items and used coupons to get the cost of my purchase down to $20.  I refuse to shop there unless I'm purchasing something on sale.  For everything else, ill shop where the bargains are.< /review>

< Review>
Safeways Rockridge has really gone downhill. I bought two servings of sushi and the woman making the sushi gave me two bottles of water and said they were free with the sushi purchase. They had a sign posted also. I get home and notice i had been charged $15.98 for the two free bottles of water. I went back to get my money. And it is a whole other big issue.  Safeways employees don't seem to care about doing a good job and have horrible customer service skills. On that same visit i have to wait 20  minutes to get helped at the deli counter. Only one gentleman was helping customers althought there were many employees behind the counter. Always some kind of issue everytime i get to the check stand.  Example: cashier trying to charge me $17 for a turnip and then stands there for 5 minutes not knowing what to do.<//Review>

<Date>1590199003474</Date><text>Bigger Safeway than the closest one to the house with lots of parking but this Safeway is regularly pretty dingy looking. Since the pandemic started it's gotten worse. Employees routinely do not wear their face masks properly (nose completely exposed or below their chin) and rarely keep the 6 foot distance. I had to continuously move away if I asked a question on whether they had an item in stock as they are frequently out of things (understandable but I don't need you to stand a foot or less away from me to let me know).

On top of all this, the store generally looks dirty and the produce doesn't look very good even pre-pandemic.  It's rare to find them cleaning the carts as you take them and they only had one person cleaning just the handle bar as opposed to spraying down the entire cart like at other stores. The thing is that I went at a very busy time of day when even the upper parking lot was getting crowded and I had to exit through the front of the store to find a cart to begin with. The one I found hadn't even been cleaned but I happened to walk towards the front to buy fruit and passed the woman cleaning them and she cleaned the bar for me (she was very nice but why do they only have one person cleaning carts at such a busy time? Having to rush leads to mistakes which is dangerous for the employee and the customers.

The one good thing I can say as every employee I ran into was very nice and I hope they're doing okay during this time but I really have to wonder if management is doing all they can to keep them as well as customers safe< /text><rate>2</rate></record>

What is needed is more people on the floor to assist customers in finding things . Parking is crowded at times because of all the stores they have there so be patient . If you have time on your hands , that's the place to go .< /review>< name>

Great location. Great people always ready to help out however they can.
Above and beyond.
The customer lounge offers a place to connect, get some work done (wi-fi) or just get out of the rain.
More than just a grocery store.
Their good neighbors
and a vital part of the neighborhood.<//review>

The hot food section looked amazing! Everything was cooked fesh. I tried the general tsao chicken. It was very good. It wasn't drowning in sauce and it was cooked perfect. I will certainly be back to try many more. I also tried one of the salt and pepper chicken wings. It was very tasty as well. Parking in the main lot was a bear but there was plenty of parking in the upper level area.</review>< Pictures>

This is an excellent Safeway store, however l have one problem with it. Customer service really needs to be addressed because the deli evidently needs someone to answer the phone. My call went unanswered and I eventually had to go to the store to see if what l wanted was available. Being the senior citizen l am , I didn’t want to come out and find what l needed was not available. 🥺</review>

<Text>I really like this Safeway store. The fruits and vegetables are fresh and the employees in that department as well as other departments are very helpful. Since it is a large store it has a good variety of items to choose from in most categories. I cannot rate the meat department since I am a vegetarian. The woman stocking the wine was most helpful and said that she had recently visited the winery whose wine I chose. The roof top parking is less crowded and has an elevator to the store.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Update 2019-12-27: Still the absolute worst customer service. Came in, stood in line, unloaded cart after the previous person, was told that the line was closed after I had finished unloading.

Terrible checkers with bad customer service, long wait times, changing prices and limited useful stock. Better off at any other grocery store (high prices or low prices) on terms of value and wasted time.< /Review>

New Safeway with a HUGE selection of foods. This Safway has the biggest variety of foods that I have seen, and is super big! They have so much sushi, fresh produce, and frozen stuff. A great Safeway to go to if you want many options.</Text>

This Safeway is the nicest one in Oakland. However there are a ton of checkout stands and never enough checkers. The lines are always long no matter the time or day. Fortunately they do have a large selection so you can find most everything you need. There is also rooftop parking with an elevator for people with strollers or those requiring extra assistance.<//review>

<Text>Their delivery service is unreliable at best.  I've been using the Safeway delivery out of the Broadway store for about a year now.  It is great when it lives up to the scheduled delivery times...but it rarely does that.  In fact twice the delivery never showed up.  But frequently the deliveries are several hours late of the scheduled time.  And rarely do I get a heads up from the delivery service that they are going to be late.  It's a shame that they can't deliver on time as scheduled because when they do it's great.  I do not recommend Safeway delivery from the Broadway store if you absolutely need your order on time.

Update as of 1/15/2020:

They've gotten worse, thus the degrade from two to one star which is as low as it goes.  In three recent attempts, the delivery failed to show up twice entirely.  No warnings that the deliveries would not be made; so I waited and waited for hours without the driver showing.  On each occasion I contacted customer service who had no explanation as to why the deliveries were not made.  On the first no-show they gave me $15 credit for the next order.  For the second no-show, the customer service rep never called me back as he promised he'd do.  So no credit was offered.  If you want reliable food delivery, I recommend you not use Safeway at this address.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80857dee0a47167d:0xf27017e586294989<//gmap_id>< pictures>

< Review>
The interior has been re-modeled, so it's all new. It seems larger, so even on busy days (like Jul 3rd) a day before a major holiday, the store still doesn't feel crowded, just has LLOOONNGG LINES. You aren't running into other people in the aisles. The only issue is parking. However, you have the option of parking upstairs.<//Review>

Went into the store cause the current ad has crab for $5.99lb. Meat market advised they do not have crab/did not have crab as of sales ad date and may or may not have crab at all during the time frame of the ad.< /Text>

Nice Safeway as far as Safeways go. The people who work here are nice and the store itself is big with a decent selection. It's only open until 2am so if you need a late night grocery store adventure, you'll have to look for another Safeway.< /text>

My most recent visit had the CS rep treat ME like an idiot, fail to listen or look up ANYTHING I asked her help with, and then acted like *I* was the problem in this equation! She was SO rude that I had to call the corporate CS# just to get my product question answered! And yes, I did file a complaint against her!!<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Lots of stuff, which is nice in some ways, just more stuff to root around in others   Produce frequently doesn't have basic stuff: lose carrots, basil....  the store if 10 times bigger than the Piedmont grocery and 4 times more likely to not have what I need.  On the other hand Safeway is cheaper, but frustrating nevertheless.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Review>Big new store with lots of selection most things.  General condition and cleanliness have gone fairly quickly downhill, though.  Produce selection surprisingly limited for a store of this size. Worst feature is constant bombardment with truly bad and annoying music, as if they'd like you to leave as quickly as possible.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

It was a few days before Thanksgiving, so I was kind of frantic, just trying to grab the things I needed and get out. I hadn't been to this store before, and I found the layout confusing. I did find most of what I was looking for, and I didn't have to wait too long to check out, so I guess it was okay.<//Text>

Update: They added self-checkouts now!

Honestly, this is one of the biggest and nicest Safeway around. It can get crowded around rush hour but they have plenty of registers open. The employees are friendly and polite.

The only negative thing I can point out is that they don't have those self checkouts machines.<//text>

<text>I believe this is Corporate Standard Practices to ALWAYS inquire:

" Do you have a Safeway™ Card you would like to use today?"

Socialising and being neighborly with other Customers in Aisle 5 [ 9:30pm.6.10.2019 ] at Safeway Rockridge I forgot to use my Safeway Discount Card when purchasing 2 Cartons of Lact•Aid "You can drink Milk again!" Lactose-Free Milk Product [ 6.4¢ per Oz. @ $3.99 on Sale ]

I paid 10 $1.00 bills with a Total of for both Cartons.

Leaving the store outside and stopping to check the Price$ paid for my items ( as is a good idea after being Tran$action Proce$$ed through their Conveyor Belt Comb — with no automated self check-out$  like Target mind you ),

I looked at the Receipt of Price Paid for Good$ $old  $9.98( including Tax ) and noticed the "$avings" discrepancy and promptly about faced and returned to Aisle 5 to return the Good$ that I felt I had been overcharged for to receive my $aving$.

After placing the Double Bagged Cartons of Fake Milk  with original receipt on the Conveyor Belt, the Female Cashier Accusingly said "What's this for!?"

As a result of non-effective communication when I clearly stated :" I am returning this to get my discount with my Safeway Card",

She did not know how to do an Override and when asking the next cashier in Aisle 6 for help she only received two cards

( I can only assume this was the other cashier in Aisle 6 thinking that only a SFWY card was needed to get the discount as my cashier set them both down near her register and asked me for my Safeway Card ),

From here She attempted to pay me ( in ¢a$h ) $7.98 – then she asked my for the money ($7.98) that She had just given me – in Ex¢hange for the Milk Substitute.

I am going to accept responsibility for possibly confounding her ( because She clearly did Not understand what I stated to her and drew a blank ) with my placing of the bagged items on to the Conveyer Comb, and recognize that people are attempting to do their best;

The difference being the attitude that makes the difference. The lady who is old enough to know better clearly felt upset that day and should not have attempted a return transaction if she did not know how.

I will avoid her in the future.< /text>< Pics>

<review>Update: They added self-checkouts now!

Honestly, this is one of the biggest and nicest Safeway around. It can get crowded around rush hour but they have plenty of registers open. The employees are friendly and polite.

The only negative thing I can point out is that they don't have those self checkouts machines.</review>< pictures>

The Manager who was working the checkout line was great, and the location is much nicer than the previous location.

But it seems that this location is chronically understaffed, making lines pretty long sometimes.</review>

<userid>116749949855426554381<//userid><Text>I would like to be able to give zero or negative stars. The story starts with a horrible pharmacy experience. We tried the pharmacy here (big mistake!) due to Walgreens having constant computer issues and not getting prescriptions. The prescription would be ready but unable to be released due to the computer. My spouse is a first responder, injured on the job. Due to the injury, on a pain medication plan. Each time we had to deal with Sabrina McQueen, the pharmacist from H*LL, she was rude to say the least. The recent incident by far the worse. She was loud, rude & accusatory. Fortunately we have great insurance & have been able to transfer post-op care elsewhere. I spoke with a manager who was supposed to call back. Nothing. While we are lucky & can go elsewhere I feel for those who cannot. We will not be returning to this pharmacy ever or Safeway at this location since we did not receive a call back with the information promised by the manager. I would rather buy milk at mulberry’s or lucky’s then here. Both have great customer service with friendly & helpful staff. The manager at mulberry’s actually assisted in the shopping for a going away basket just last week. Customer service matters, clearly a concept lost at this Safeway, especially the pharmacy.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80857dee0a47167d:0xf27017e586294989<//gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rate>

< Review>
The lack of open cash registers is at times like a Woody Allen movie with often long times. Then the questionably trained staff likes to talk to the customers and tell stories. Mgr nice, means well but she seems overwhelmed and doesn’t have much control

Also better phone service would help when try to call home to get question answered. Mgr stories<//Review>

<text>This Safeway is with out a doubt one of the best I've ever shopped. It's clean, has EVERYTHING a person could want & more 99% of employees are friendly the deli area has an amazing variety of pre made meals & even 3 hot bars to choose from ! Very large store. Parking lot is huge. Fantastic wine selection. I can go on & on but I think you get the idea. 10 star rating. A must shopping experience!👍< /text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

I have spent
the last 45 (plus) minutes. On hold waiting for customer service. What's worse, I had to call 4 times and a rude man hung up on me the 2 times they did answer. I was asking if I could  use a credit /debit card from my phone so my daughter could go get some food. I WAS able to ask my question. But hanging up on someone is NOT an answer.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Brand new, extra large store. The extra space allows them to offer more of the higher end products usually only found at Whole Foods. Great to be able to buy junk food and healthy food all in one place, lol! Only downside is they recently went from 24 hours to closing at 2a.m. If you are there walking around outside you may even see deer on the lagoon side of fence.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>WAAAAAAY overpriced and Safeway obliterated Long's in the same footprint to build in their present location. Long's was an EVENT to go to, like the old timey Woolworths back in the 50's in other parts of the country with tons of high-end, but accessibly priced UNIQUE hippy and progressive health type products, but Safeway and CVS have DESTROYED that flavor It's now a corporate monocultural WASTELAND shopping experience even with a new building and better parking. When they took over Long's they KILLED a lady Marina, who was the very best house/garden plant buyer in the entire U.S. (have lived in more than 60 different places in the U.S.). Marina got cancer and died within several months of the protested Safeway destruction of the former Longs. :(  I will NEVER forgive the executives at Safeway for what they did.</Text>< rating>

What an outstanding store for customer service. Unbeknownst to me, I hadI accidentally left my cc at the checkout counter. In a state of utter anxiety, six hours later I called the store to discover it was there and safely locked up. Thank you, Safeway, especially Erica in Customer Service who was just great.< /text>

I love this new Safeway. Lot's of parking, big selection.
However, the deli counter is always understaffed. Long waits every time I go.
The people working are always nice.<//Text>

One of the more high tech and affluent Safeways in the the east bay (they vary incredibly in selection and cleanliness) not a bad spot for a quick deli order later in the evening, or Alcohol run.<//Text>

The service at this Safeway is very low quality.
The staff is not familiar with the produce that they carry. Baggers place heavy items on top of fragile items. Lines back up really long and they don't call up more cashiers when needed. I really don't like this Safeway! I really wish it was better service because it is so convenient being right near my home. But as of now it is most always a regretful trip to the grocery store.</Text>

<Review>Sadly, won’t be shopping at this Safeway anymore. Just had my car broken into around 7pm. Lots of customers and cars in and out. Well lit. Sadly, asked the employee who worked there if he had seen anything take place - he was shuffling carts back and forth. He said no. When asked if this happens often, he said yes - he has seen cars broken into many times before. Sadly, cameras are only right in front of the Safeway so of no use when parked in the lot. 👎 if my car isn’t safe there, I won’t feel comfortable shopping. I only went in for a couple items but turns out it was long enough to be robbed and have my window smashed. They should do what other shopping areas do - like Trader Joe’s shopping area down in Emeryville - install more cameras in the parking area!<//Review>< gmap_id>

They're new, maybe around 2 years old and close to the UC Berkeley campus. I would suggest to not go during Tuesdays because thats when they restock their inventory. Even better that this safeway is open 24 hours because its definitely saved the day during emergencies. Their rooftop parking lot blocks cell service a little bit so reception is a little spotty inside. I would highly suggest to download the Safeway app because it has a lot of grest deals and coupons. I've made it a game every time i go to see how much i ended up saving at the end of each trip. The best I've ever done is 50 percent.</review><user_name>Lily Dang< /user_name>< rate>

Slowest cashiers ever?  Not enough help? Pick your posion. It doesn't even matter the time of day, plan to be in line waiting as long as you are shopping.<//review>

<rating>2</rating><Text>Normally I have a good experience at this Safeway, it's clean and spacious, however this morning I went to get something for lunch and I just wanted ranch for the chicken wings that I got. They were ur in all the baskets. All 3 deli people I asked we're hella rude, basically they were like if it's not up there we don't have any. Not let me check for you. Well I looked around and found some where the pre made deli stuff was. Than I went to check out and the checker was in a bad mood..... Customer service is everything, in the past I would of gave this store 5 stars, but a bad attitude will get you no where fast in my book.</Text>< user>

This is the first time since you  opened this store that i received the best coustomer service. The cashier was Sariah ! I hope  you  will let Sariak teach the Deli employee's what coustomer service really should be ..</Review>
