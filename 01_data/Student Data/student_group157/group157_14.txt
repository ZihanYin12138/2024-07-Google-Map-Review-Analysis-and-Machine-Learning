They are very efficient, quick to respond, answer my questions, and provides excellent feedback as designers. I requested a sign that will work with the aesthetics of the office and they provided one that looks sophisticated, works with the office aesthetics, and were fast to install it. Overall, a great experience which is why we love working with them.< /Review>

<Review>As a member of the U.S. Coast Guard, Sector San Diego, I had quite a large order to place for our base with only about a week to get it all done. Dimitri and his team modified and returned proofs within a day and pushed the order through with time to spare. I was very impressed with their quality of work and professionalism. They lived up to the name of Fast Signs. If you drive by Coast Guard sector near the airport, take a look at the hangar and you can see their work for yourself!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

James & Kevin have helped me in the past with signage at my property.  They had done such a great job then both in terms of quality & timeliness, that when I needed modifications to the signage, they were the people to go to.  Kevin was prompt & courteous, and I had the initial bid for the work the same day, with the proof of work to be done all approved by day 2.  The installation was completed to my satisfaction by the 3rd day.
Time & again, Kevin & James at Fastsigns have demonstrated their commitment to putting customer first, and getting the work done ASAP.  I would highly recommend anyone needing signage work to use them.  They stick with their estimates, are reasonable and highly prompt in getting the work done.<//Text>

Very knowledgeable and can handle big jobs.
We're in the process of getting a sign for our law-firm and have been working with Dimitri. It's a pretty big job. I've been impressed with Dimitri's knowledge, patience, and constant willingness to go above and beyond. When the project gets finished we'll upload photos to this site. Thank you Dimitri. We're looking forward to the finished product.<//text>

They were true to their name and fast with making the signs! When I came to pick up, they accommodated me and the sleeping baby in my car and brought the signs out to my car for me. They had our previous art work on file, which made this order even easier for us!<//Text>

Excellent fast friendly service. Although I only ordered one single SMALL sign for $40 they made me feel as if I ordered a BIG sign for $400. I will definitely use their services again and I am definitely going to refer them to other people. In fact someone asked me where I had my sign made and I told him to go to FAST SIGNS in National City.</Text>

Fastsigns National City has been helping my business look good for more than 6 years. They have created several different outdoor signs for me including 2 store front mounted sings, several A frames, and garden signs too. They have also created countless indoor signs.  The owner and his crew know their stuff, they are professional, kind and helpful.  I tell anyone I know who needs signs to go see Fastsigns National City!</review>

Fastsigns did a fantastic job on creating our customized sign for our building. It was exactly what we wanted and they worked with me step by step to make sure I was taken care of. The communication was absolutely the best I've ever had with any company and I will for sure work with them again. I was very worried at first as this was my first time working with a new company, but I was extremely satisfied with what they created. Thank you for doing such a great job!!

We had a family reunion in San Diego and were in need of a banner for our out door events.  We contacted Staples, Office Depot and a shop in Old Town SD as Siri suggested and none of the 3 stores we visited were able to fulfill our order in time for our needs.  We Googled "Banners in National City" and the result of that search led us to Fastsigns.  We only had an idea for a banner and would need to take delivery the next day.  The people were professional, courteous and understanding of our situation and assured us that they will deliver and they did just that.  The banner turned out better and more creative than I had imagined and the most important part to us was having it in time to welcome our families visiting from around the country.  Thank you James and Staff.<//Review>

We contact Fastsigns to replace our business signage on our front door. Response was fairly quick  and the sign looks very nice on the door (definitely better than what was originally there). We would definitely work with this company again if the need arises.<//Text>

<review>FastSigns lives up to its name of delivering quotes, proofs, and installs FAST! And the customer service is impeccable. I know we're not the only client, but it's pretty amazing to feel like we are. Prices are really competitive, too! Habitat for Humanity will definitely be using FastSigns for future projects.<//review><date>1491521313910</date>< userid>

<text>The moving team from Good Neighbors was great.  The move from Calabasas to Santa Monica went very smoothly. The crew arrived on time, worked quickly, and was very friendly.  There were no hidden charges or fees, and the original estimate was accurate.  I would absolutely use this company again, and would highly recommend it to my friends.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>I just had a move with Good Neighbors that was about 100 miles from my original location. They did a fantastic job! The guys were friendly and personable and worked very hard and quickly. It cost me less than I was quoted. Nothing was broken and they made the experience a good one, rather than stressful. I highly recommend their services and if I had to move again I would absolutely call them!!  If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would!!!<//text><Rating>5<//Rating><name>Myrna Todd<//name><UserId.>104441735779041576425< /UserId.><Date>1626204695084<//Date></record></dataset><record>

We were forced to cut the job short after we brought your items inside or to a secure location of your choosing. I'd also like to make clear, in case there is any confusion, that we have not charged you for your move. We have tried to reach you, but have been unsuccessful. We encourage you to call us at 323-828-0555 it's important that this matter be resolved."}< /response><Review>**BEWARE!!** DO NOT USE THESE MOVERS!

My family and I all agree that this is the best moving company we’ve experienced. They were very careful with our furniture and covered everything. Very professional, honest, great personalities, efficient and super patient. I give them a 5* easily. Thank you Brad!</review>

<text>From the initial appointment and quote process with Phil, to the days just prior to the move to confirm and answer any additional questions, to the day of the actual pickup and drop off, Good Neighbors was incredible. Moving is easily one of the most stressful events in a person’s life, and when you have a professional and efficient company in place to get the job done, it makes all the difference in the world. My team - Tim, Angel, and another Angel - showed up with smiles on their face and ready to get to work. They were friendly and put me immediately at ease. They made everything look so easy as they loaded out all my stuff. All of my items were properly wrapped up and everything was secured well into the truck which was huge. Once they made it to my drop off location, I was worried about the stairs because I couldn’t imagine getting my pretty heavy furniture up a single flight of stairs, let alone 3. But these guys did it and faster than almost humanly possible. They never complained. They never stood around. And even my small requests were met with no issue and total understanding. They made my day, and the move was a complete success. I highly recommend this moving company to anyone out there looking for a solid, trustworthy, and capable team. This is the one. Thank you for everything, Good Neighbors! I am a very satisfied customer.<//text>< rate>

<review>Good Afternoon people i had the luck to hire the Good Neighbors Moving Company to move me from my 3 bedroom apartment. The work they did was more than awesome. If i can give 10 stars i would. Sean,Steve, and Walter did a super job with my stuff properly blanketing everything and shrink wrapping everything professionally. Not one scratch or hit on my walls. Was very pleased with the prices too. I more than recommend the Good Neighbors Moving Company without a doubt. BEST IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND ANYWHERE IN THE NATION. THANK YOU GOOD NEIGHBORS!!</review>< pictures>

Alex and Tim were incredible.  They packed and moved my belongings from a condo to a storage unit.  They worked non-stop from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm, no breaks or lunch.  They were respectful of my belongings.  They were professional and obviously knew what they are doing. I didn't think they could get all of my stuff in the storage unit but they did. What a relief!  They worked just as hard the last hour as they did the first. They took the stress out of moving.  Many thanks!</Text>

<Text>I would not recommend this company- they didn’t handle my items with care, didn’t wrap things well enough so many of my items were broken and damaged the walls and floors of brand new house. Terrible experience<//Text></record>

<text>I recently moved within Los Angeles, and Jose, James and Sam were my guys. They did a thorough and professional job of wrapping and packing all my breakable items, including my 55" TV, large furniture like my bed and couch, as well as my glass coffee and end-tables. They arrived promptly within the time window promised, called when they were on the way. It took a little less than 3-hours for them to move everything from my 1-bedroom upstairs apartment, to my new condo which is about 7-miles away. Great job guys!! Moving can be really stressful, but Good Neighbors and these three guys made it easy!!!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I used GNMC a few days ago moving closer to LA and I would 110% recommend this company for your next move. Marcel and Andrew were extremely professional, efficient, and just all around fun to be around. I will for sure use GNMC again the next time I move!</Text>

Spoke with Matt at Good Neighbors today. Unfortunately the services I need (long distance) isn't there specialty but Matt went above and beyond in providing me with info to help me anyways. I can't say that I've experienced a move with them but if their service is anything like what Matt provided today, I would have to recommend them.</review>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2c36e296aaaab:0x8809949cedb96957</Gmap_id><review>I need to leave a pretty unfortunate review as a forewarning to potential customers, since the majority of the ones on the Google page seem to be flying fives.

For context, this entire move took less than three hours from start to finish to move from Hollywood to Miracle Mile with a different moving company who was unfortunately already booked for this move so I had to hire Good Neighbors.

To start off, the two movers were late by 40 minutes outside of their original 30 minute window. If you need to block off an elevator at your new complex, be aware you'll need to push this out by a bit of time just simply because of this delay.

Once they signed the contract and were on the clock, they proceeded to move their truck for over 30 minutes to a different parking spot (when they had already told me where they were parked was great). They started working nearly two hours from the original start time.

After they started, they got the majority of things packed away within 30-45 minutes, but then proceeded to take nearly four hours to move it from the unit to the truck. After what seemed like over an hour, I went downstairs to check and see what could be slowing them down. They saw me and immediately were back upstairs within minutes to take more contents down.

Not only were they moving at an incredibly slow pace, they were also just very inconsiderate with how they handled my items. I'll get more on this later in the review, but take note of this.

After four hours of packing and moving all of my belongings into the truck, I went to the new complex (0.2 miles away) to block off the elevator. Both movers ended up taking about a ~30 minute break to grab lunch (understandable with how long it took them to load). They said this was certainly going to be marked off of me final time (it wasn't).

Once they finally got to the new complex, nearly five hours progressed from the start time.  To ensure I wasn't going to get a 10-15 hour bill, I had to help them move the ENTIRE contents of the truck. They took the elevator, I took the stairs. The entire unload took less than two hours because I made them hustle.

When I came down to help move the final load, one of the movers ACCUSED me of BREAKING the legs of a mirror. He insinuated that I had climbed up into their truck to move things around, and had made it fall. He fought with me for TEN minutes accusing me of the broken leg.

Amongst the leg of my mirror, they also jammed my desk drawers so it is now unusable, jammed my weights so they no longer rotated, COMPLETELY took apart my bed and reassembled it. Now it squeaks every time I move. I will need to hire someone to come by and adjust all of the screws so it no longer does this.

Along with the time wasted, they also were both answering phone calls the entire day, stopping to text, etc.. They also just threw all of the contents of my apartment inside and didn't unwrap anything or try to place it in the correct room.

The entire move took nearly SEVEN hours to move 0.2 miles away including their attempted PAID lunch, the extra THIRTY minutes to park, and trying to blame ME for my broken items. This has been the WORST moves I have ever had to deal with.<//review>< pictures>

We paid for premium quality service, and we were treated with “I paid for sketchy movers from Craigslist” service.

The movers were sketchy to begin with, and it wasn’t just the smell of marijuana on 3 our of 4 of them either. They barely asked questions about our delicate belongings—ornaments, dishes, priceless trinkets, etc.—and they barely made any effort to protect any of it. Their idea of safely storing items was mixing hundreds of dollars of expensive electronic equipment such as printers, computer monitors, and speakers into big boxes full of delicate class ornaments. (I’ll be posting some pictures of their services on Yelp soon. Their methods of packing would surprise anyone with a brain.)

On top of ruining several decorations, dishes, and computer equipment, they also managed to ruin a few paintings and furniture as well. We paid for several packing boxes, bubble wrap, paper to carefully pack items, stretch wrap, and moving blankets, all for them to use barely any of it.

Allegedly this was supposed to be premium 5-Star service. Seriously? These kids looked like they barely graduated high school and didn’t care about anything besides playing Xbox and smoking weed. Oh yeah, speaking of which, one of those degenerate scumbags stole my 2TB Seagate Xbox hard drive—something I paid damn good money for.

Word of the wise:

Do not acquire this business’s services unless you want thieving delinquents to break and steal your possessions—unless you really want to find a way to waste your money and get super angry in the most efficient way possible, in which case more power to you, I suppose.< /review>

Ricky, Brent, and Jose were fantastic. They were professional, efficient, and fast. Great customer service and I really appreciated them having me walk them through the packing and moving process, such as which pieces to move first/last and with placing furniture and heavy boxes where I wanted them to be. Also really friendly!! I would recommend these 3 men to anyone, and especially the company as a whole. This was one of the greatest moving experiences I’ve had.< /review>

One of the worst moving experiences I’ve ever had in the six years I’ve lived in Los Angeles. After receiving a very reasonable estimate I decided to go ahead and schedule my move with this company. From the start everything seemed to move very slowly. SIX hours later they finally got everything out of my ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT and started the 12 minute drive to my new place. After over an hour they finally arrived, dumped my stuff and finished the job after almost 10 hours total. The bill was WAY larger than I had been told it would be and after unpacking I found that a majority of my furniture was damaged, broken, or loose.

I feel ripped off and now I am 100x more stressed.</Review>

Jose Ricky and Jake were really respectful and patient especially since my daughter insisted on “helping “ but really she was just getting in their way. But they worked around her and were very nice to her as well. None of my things were damaged during the move and they helped me put all my belongings where I needed them to go.< /review>

I've hired other moving companies in the past, who took longer,  drove further,  and did just as good a job for half of what I paid for with this company.  Other than that,  the whole experience was very pleasant!</text>< userid>

<Review>Jose and Ricky took care of my move. They’re phenomenal and very professional got me all moved and I greatly appreciate their work.

Their was a mix up on time of arrival.
Matt the manager called me one day before my date to move, to tell me that the original time that was give to me wasn’t feasible as they never have a mid day time slot. I was very compromising and was okay with a later time. I had to make some personal moves so that the new time given to me was capable.
The day of my move Matt called me to tell me that the movers were on there way I was shocked because that was my original time that he said was absolutely not feasible.
After giving me a hard time on the phone and then telling me that he didn’t say that. I stood my ground to the 2nd time slot as I have already done the most to make that time work based on what he said. He then said,  that they will be coming at the later side of the 2nd time slot.

At that time I was so annoyed that I was fine with it. Of course that wasn’t true and the came  at the 1st hour of the time slot he gave me. I think he needs to have a bit more compassion for clients that are moving and using this company services also he need to not lie or stretching the truth. Because it make an awful impression of the
Other then that everything else was fine.
But at the end of the move and having to pay a substantial amount it was terrible service on Matt’s part to say and do all he did about the time slot.

Well I use them again maybe not if I fine a better deal.</Review>< Pictures>

Moving my elderly parents from Pasadena to the Central Valley is a huge undertaking.  Good Neighbors Moving was absolutely awesome in helping us accomplish this. They were friendly,  punctual,  and excellent at packing and unpacking.  I loved how we were able to communicate with them by text. So curteous and helpful.  I would totally recommend them!!! Thanks again  guys!</Review>

I was expecting them to come between 2 and 5 but they came at about 12 o’clock. I asked them to do the big heavy stuff first like the couch, bed fridge, dresser. And God bless them because it started to rain and they got a lot done. I was just moving from one apt. To another in the same building so they walked everything and it saved us packing/ unpacking the truck and drive time. If you need help moving, I totally recommend. It’s best to pack your own stuff in boxes because it saves time as well.< /Text>

honestly, one of the best choices i made was hiring a moving company, ESPECIALLY hiring Good Neighbors. They were on time, responsive, and were as fast as possible. On top of that, they were really nice guys! Very helpful and figured out how to maneuver two apartments worth of stuff into our new place. would def hire them again.< /Review>

I have not moved EVER, so I was a bit nervous about the process. The Good Neighbors Movers team came in, asked a few questions, then smiled and said, “please feel free to sit down and relax.” They were amazing and I highly recommend them. Quick, careful, and nice 3 guys moved me from a townhouse in Northridge to a house in Burbank in 2 hours! Very respectful. Nothing broken. Super reasonable price. Highly recommend.<//Text>

I had a very difficult move out of an old building in downtown Los Angeles. After speaking with Matt, he was able to put me at ease. The guys were professional
and made sure that everything was wrapped, protected and delivered promptly. I highly recommend this company  based on the fact that they got my move done
in a timely fashion despite the small and slow elevator in my building. Their professional attitude, customer service sure put me at ease. I love this business and
highly recommend it.< /Text>

Had a great experience with this company. They helped us move from Pasadena to DTLA. They Showed up on time and gave us a heads up prior to let us know they were on the way! Luis and Victor made the move quick and super easy.  5 star service would recommend to anyone who is looking for movers.< /review>

< Review>
Luis and his crew of 2 arrived on time and immediately got to work.  My husband and I was exhausted from packing the night before so their early arrival was a blessing.  The crew were very friendly, and worked diligently for  approximately 6 hours.  We didn't realize how much stuff we had accumulated in a 17 year span.

I wanted to give the crew 5 stars but, after they moved us to our destination, the unpacking got a little crazy.  I can understand being exhausted, because the guys definitely earned their pay.  But in the end, things didn't get put back together as promised.  My refrigerator was a very large and heavy item to move, so they removed the door and emptied the contents of some of my frozen items into an unmarked box.  The refrigerated part was emptied in another unmarked box.  Well to make a very long story short, I'm still looking for my frozen tamales, frozen blueberries, etc.  The milk, eggs and butter are still MIA.  I guess I'll locate the tamales when they start to smell.  The guys did ask if there was anything else we wanted them to do.  We told them no and thanked them for their help.  We assumed they had put my refrigerator back together as we wanted it to stay in garage for extra storage.  Well the next morning we went into the garage to look for the frozen food and realized they hadn't put the refrigerator back together.  They put the door back on, but left all the drawers and shelves leaning against the wall.

Today is day 3, still haven't recovered my food, there were so many boxes to go through, we're still looking.  But again the guys were friendly, personable and efficient, but the end of the move was disappointing.</Review>

Good Neighbors did a great job with my move. Oscar, Javier and Eli saved my day. They were on time ,polite and managed to move my apartment very fast and without any damage. This was my first time using a moving services and I was blown away with the quality of the work. All my items were very fragile and
expensive and they definitely knew how to treat them with care< /Review>

Awhile back I needed help moving a big refrigerator so I asked friends and got several recommendations for Matt Waller. I was so blown away by how reliable, helpful, affordable, easy-going and sweet he was, that I told everyone I could about him. (I was glad to have the recommendation we got and felt so safe having him in our home.)

Fast forward some time later. We had to move unexpectedly because our landlords were selling the building we were living in. The move was going to be rushed and hard and I was in a panic. Again, I thought of Matt. I called him and was super thrilled to hear he had started a moving company. He was just as awesome to deal with as before, responsive and helpful and he gave me a great quote for two guys and a big truck that we scheduled for a few days later. Victor and Luis (sp?) showed up and were absolutely amazing. They were strong, fast, smart and lovely to be around.

I highly recommend Matt and Oak Brothers Moving for any job you have!<//text>

< Review>
I needed a refrigerator and stove picked up and delivered to my new apartment. They were able to get it done same day. Phil came out to pick up the items and was very helpful. Moving the appliances up two flights of stairs was not a problem. I will use this company again for my next move.</Review>

< Review>
I read some of the reviews for this company online.  Everybody was extremely happy with their experience, and you can add us to that club now.  We were selling a house in La Mirada and buying a home in Sugarloaf (Big Bear area).  We had to change dates a few times and we were always accommodated.  They really do aim to help you in any way they can - from carrying a cat into the house that was too big for me to lift, to giving me a hug during their second trip up.  I was all alone and got a bit overwhelmed for a minute.  I got a huge hug (NOT A CREEPY ONE!) with the assurance that I was doing great and to keep going.  I am a 62 year old disabled person and my husband was back in La Mirada wrapping things up there.  These guys were like family and treated us and our myriad belongings like we were the most important things in the world.  I cannot begin to explain how wonderful an experience we have had.  Super low rates, very easy to understand rate structure and exemplary service.  Thank you all for making this move to the mountains, peace and tranquility, possible!< /Review>

<Review>The guys that moved me from Southern California to Northern California were totally on their game.  They made a painful situation much less painful.  They took charge and just did their job.

These guys were absolutely amazing. I was able to call them the day of ON A SUNDAY and because they had an opening, they were happy to oblige.  They were pleasant, hard-working, and very agreeable even though i was less than prepared for the move. I was so pleased and thankful they could help at the spur of the moment, i left a $100 tip. You will be in good hands with this bunch for sure.< /Text>

My moving experience was stress free because I used Good Neighbors. Philip was prompt with getting me a quote for my move. When the time came the movers were prompt and ready to get to work. The whole move only took a few hours!</review>

<Text>Thank you Oak Brothers!!!  Great job. They worked hard, followed instructions and were done in less time than i estimated.

Three people moving from a one bedroom in Pasadena to a studio in Marina del ray.

They took the time to wrap my furniture in plastic and blankets and tied everything down in the truck so there was no shifting.</Text>< rating>

Phil was great with moving a refrigerator I bought off Craigslist. He ran into problems getting the fridge doors off to fit through a doorway, and had to go out and buy a special tool for the job, and didn't charge me extra. Big headache, but he handled it like a pro. I'll def call him again for future moving jobs.</text>

<Time>1608957239162</Time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>Yet another excellent, independent, local find thanks to Yelp!

This is a kiosk in a quiet Danville strip mall that serves super high-quality coffee. I opted for a hot Turkish coffee to go and it was as intensely bold and rich as I'd expected - and then some. A gentleman who I'm guessing is the husband of the owner was also super explanatory about the coffee and gave me a few sweets to help wash it down.

Look closely and you'll also see Russian and other European sweets and treats for sale along their left side wall. Can't wait to come back and try more of their offerings!<//review>< Pictures>

Great place. Superb mocha. Love it how they ask for the sweetness level. I usually don't order mochas but they make the best mocha I've ever had. They were so nice and pleasant which I greatly appreciate. Thank you! It's hard for me to eat in the morning so I finally got around to eat the cranberry scone. It is really good, what a scone should be in my opinion.< /text>

The lady who runs the business is lovely, kind and polite. The prices are fair; you can even yourself a Turkish coffee in the afternoon; the have limited outdoor sitting for when the weather is nice.< /Review>

I love Medleno's lattes!  Durring the pandemic and since I am home more, I have been making my own.  Medleno has been my go to for beans.  My favorite is the Nicaraguan roast.  Smooth, fresh and delicious. Not bitter like many others.  I am always greeted by the owners with kindness. Also, I feel safe with the covid precautions they have taken.<//review>

Have visited this specific location twice now and I just didn’t like the pour over  coffee or the latte I ordered. The place is nice and clean. The barista is phenomenally nice and good spirited. And the location is low key.< /text>

This place is awesome. They roast their own coffee - which is very rare and you can taste it. This is the best coffee in the area.

There's no place to sit, so grab your coffee and go.
The next day, you'll be back for more.</Text>

They are working on the deck plates with their employees--hard work, dedication, and true passion poor into their business on a daily basis, yet they are always there to greet their costumers with a "smile" or "hello" every day. Igor and Ina are the best and two of the hardest working people I know! You can tell there is true vision behind what they're doing, to provide exceptional coffee to the community. You will not find better coffee in Danville or San Francisco!< /Review>< Pics>

Tucked in a corner. Across from Burger King in Danville. Nice family owned and ran business. The take away is no indoor seating to enjoy the great drinks. Good selection of snacks. Several different coffee selections available. The will grind you purchase to order, say for a paper or metal filter.<//text>

Great for coffee on the go or on a nice day. Location is good, just tucked in a corner where you might miss it.< /text></record></dataset><record>

After searching across the state and internet for shops/delivery services to buy my beans, this place has absolutely met or exceeded all of my expectations.

As someone that prefers the bright acidity and fruitiness of East African coffees I was thrilled to see three Ethiopians (Harrar, Sidamo, and Yirgacheffe) plus a Kenyan AA ranging from $16-21/lb (compared to the $18-24/12oz that many third wave roasters charge for similar offerings) that had all been roasted within the previous week.

The owners were clearly very knowledgeable about their product and were happy to offer tastes and samples based on my preferred brewing method to help inform my future purchases of which I'm sure there will be many.

If you live in the East Bay and care at all about what your coffee tastes like, you owe it to yourself to check out Medleno because of the impeccable quality, value, service, freshness, and variety that they offer.</text>

Cool little coffee shop (yes, little is accurate). Delicious drinks. Offered sweetener for the chai (warned it was strong), but to me it was perfect and I didn't even feel the need (I usually like things sweet, though)< /review>

When I had visited their website I had expected to visit a coffee shop/coffee roaster. Instead it is just a very small coffee shop with no tables outside. All the coffee is already bagged and the pricing was not that great. I went out my way to go to the shop and was disappointed in the experience. The coffee itself was okay but I had better coffee around town.< /text>

Ida made sure the coffee was to my liking. She even offered to make a different drink if I was not satisfied. Believe me I was very satisfied with the drink she made. This place doesn't look like much but rest assured the coffee and the service is very special. I plan on visiting Medleno Coffee Shop & Roastery every chance I get.<//Review>

Very nice coffee; ordered one cappuccino and Turkish coffee – both have fabulous taste; the coffee was smooth and have good aroma. I wish to have more pastries and space to enjoy the coffee. The shop is for ‘to go’ coffee.<//Text>

What an amazing dental office😁.  Staff was absolutely fantastic.  From the receptionist to the hygienists everyone had a smile.   They treated me as if I was family :).  The place was immaculate and my dentist, Dr. Nguyen, was very knowledgeable, friendly, and offered great treatment plans.  I felt very safe and protected with added protocols in place due to COVID-19. This dental office is above and beyond any other kid’s dental office I have ever been to.  I strongly recommend.  Thank you All Smiles and have a grateful blessed thanksgiving.< /review>

<text>I came to All Smiles to get a second opinion on whether or not I should extract my four year old daughter’s gray tooth. Not only did I get a professional opinion, the dentist found a cavity that was displayed on a previous ex ray that her initial dentist didn’t catch. I decided to have All Smiles perform the extraction and the filling and they were extremely gentle with my daughter and I knew she was in good hands as soon as we walked in the door. Not only was the dentist exceptional, the dental assistant named Esteban (Steven) was very kind and thorough during the pre and post and answered all my questions. I highly recommend them. Your kids will be in great care.<//text>< pictures>

<date>1590567049273</date><text>A friend of mine had highly recommended All Smiles. At first, I was given great service. Unfortunately, after a few months it all went down hill from there. First, I had to get out of work frequently as they wouldn't accommodate me. Next, I had my braces removed before one of the main reasons why I got the braces was fixed. Finally, my retainer had to be made again because the first and temporary retainer did not work. I am really disappointed in the service and the outcome. I had thought about recommending All Smiles. However, after this really bad experience I do not want anyone else to endure anything like this.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I came from Colorado to California to visit with my family. My 8 year daughter just got braces 3 weeks ago and of course our first incident happens when we are out of state! Part of her wire came out and as much husband and I try to calm her down we starting calling places that could help us fix it. The first couple we called would not help because we didnt get the braces put on there. When I called All Smiles the woman who answered was so helpful and told us to come straight in. We went in and the entire staff was super sweet and made her feel so comfortable.  They got us in quickly and fixed it within minutes. The doctor and staff member who fixed it were kind and reassured my daughter that she was all fixed up. I can not thank them enough for saving our vacation!</review><gmap_id>0x80dcb8012b4836b5:0x306fe80cb1dbe59d<//gmap_id>< user_id>

<name>hope grajeda< /name><text>New patients here and couldn’t be happier about our first visit for my 2 year old. It was so inviting. We were welcomed and showed around by Dani and my daughter was walked back by Makayla. Both very warm and friendly. The dentist was very gentle and efficient with my nervous 2yo but I think they caught her attention a bit when they were joking around about the PJ Masks hiding in her mouth. Very pleased with our experience with all staff and the office itself is very inviting for the kids (plus coffee for the parents, thank you for thinking of us!) Highly recommend, especially being this is our second dentist for her.<//text>< date>

This was my daughters first visit to the dentist and we had an amazing experience, Myself already being a patient at Dental Care of Corona I trusted that they would give my daughter an even better experience. The office is beautiful and calming and really put my child at ease. I think it is wonderful all the fun distractions that take their minds off of the worries, but there is even a nice set up for parents to be comfortable as well. The dental chairs and amenities are perfectly fit for youth, and new technology seems to make it easier for staff and less stressful for children. The demeanor and kindness of the staff is incomparable, they were amazing. We had such a great experience my daughter is sad she has to wait 6 months to return!<//Review>

My boys (3 & 6)love this place!! We had a previous dentist but my oldest became very nervous and anxious about loosing his baby teeth. His previous dentist was not very patient with him or his needs. So I knew I needed a different approach to handle our situation. By far the best decision I made was to go to Smile Big Dental. I have only been there twice. First time was for a regular check up and second was an emergency visit. And both times I was amazed at how awesome they treated my boys. They were even able to get xrays done on my 3 year old, that itself is a big wow! I couldn't be any happier with them. Super nice and friendly place. The girls are very knowledgeable about all my questions and concerns. The dentists are even better! I am just pleased all around with their service. My husband and I have even became their patients too. Thank you again Smile Big Dental!!< /text>

Came for a second opinion when my son needed substantial work done and we were having to pay out of pocket.  They took us right in, and even took their own X-rays at no cost to us.   Kind, honest, knowledgeable, and so well equipped with kid friendly distractions and fun.
It was the perfect balance of excellent care,  fair cost and welcoming environment.  Needless to say we chose All Smiles for our dental need. Many thanks.<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Very satisfied with our experience at this office. My 5 year old son is very hyperactive and I was nervous about how he would do in the chair. From the moment he sat down he was treated with care, enthusiasm, and understanding. My boy was thrilled he got to watch movies while he got his teeth checked, and received a token to a vending tower of toys to choose from afterwards.

Two days later (today) we were back to get some major work done. I was VERY impressed with the procedures from start to finish. Dr. Nguyen and Felix were extremely proactive in making sure he was comfortable and explained in kid terms what they were going to do next so he'd be prepared. As a mother I knew my kid was in good hands.

I cannot forget to mention the aesthetics of the waiting room, which caters to both parents and  kids. The office is clean and styled nicely with ample entertainment for the kids while they wait- books, a toy room, a video game room, a giant tv to watch a movie on, and plenty of comfortable seating. For us adults there was a coffee machine brewing Starbucks coffee and a refrigerator stocked with water bottles. I am very happy I decided to give this place a shot. We will definitely be back!</Review>< Pics>

It may be odd for children to enjoy dental visits but not for mine.  My daughter actually looks forward to her next dental review.....Not sure if its the Child Friendly waiting area -- ranging from books, online gaming, free WiFi connectivity or the movies during treatments!  Thanks a bunch to the staff at ALL SMILES for  maintaining such a pleasant atmosphere.  You all are well appreciated and highly recommended!

We are so glad to have found a wonderful kid-friendly dentist for our two boys, ages 5 & 7. From the front staff to the dentist, everyone is nice, friendly & accomodating. I would recommend this dentist to all my friends & family:)</text>

We took our kids ages 4 and 2 to All Smiles for their first dental check up.  Everyone was very nice and friendly!  The waiting room is clean and has lots of toys, books, games and fish tanks for the kids to explore.   The people who took the x rays and cleaned their teeth were very upbeat, friendly and patient.  Dr. Lan Nguyen was very thorough, funny and my kids liked him!  Overall they had a great first visit and I am so glad and relieved to have found such a great children's dentist so close to home!  I will be recommending this office to all my friends in the area!!  Thank you so much for giving my kids such a positive experience at the dentist!</Text>

< Review>
This place has been amazing! The care and attention they give to us everytime we visit is far and above anything I expected. We just started braces for my daughter a few months ago, but she needed several appointments with oral surgeons and such. I felt like they took the time and care to do the right job for my daughter's needs. They helped set up a reasonable payment and treatment plan, and gave us appointment times that worked for our family. This has been such a good experience and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for personalized and professional services.<//Review>

They are truly Amazing! My kids actually look forward to their visits. Never wait more than 5 mins from appointment time even when I've been a few mins late. They go above and beyond to give excellent service. I drive from Chino cause I love them so much. Two kids with braces and one to go and will continue to make the drive for both regular check-ups and Ortho.</review>

<GmapID>0x80dcb8012b4836b5:0x306fe80cb1dbe59d</GmapID><review>My daughter Jackson was experiencing some tooth pain.  I was headed to a franchise dental office hoping that they had space to help her and then I looked up and saw “All Smiles Orthodontics & Children’s Dentistry”. We live in Temecula and our Children’s dentist was closed, so I thought… I wonder if they can take care of my baby. Sure enough they did. I made a phone call to check their availability and I was greeted by a wonderful young lady named Britney. She was warm and accommodating and every staff member I met following mirrored the attitude set at the front door.  Unfortunately my daughters tooth did have to be extracted but the patience of the Doctor and Assistants where more than gracious. I told them that we are moving back down from Temecula and when we do, we found a home in them. Thank you All Smiles!< /review>< user_name>

< review>
Today I dropped off my 4 month old Lab Duckie for her first day trial. When I picked her up her she was as happy as can be tail wagging and all. Within seconds of being in the car she immediately fell asleep. I am super happy to find a place where I feel comfortable leaving my pup. The staff there is super friendly and you can tell how much they love dogs. We will definitely be a regular customer. Thank you dog days for all that you do!!< /review>

The staff treat you and your pets like family! Cider loves going to play and I never worry when she stays for boarding. The daily outings are. Great add-on to keep your pup stimulated.

I am so glad I found them and Cider 🍺 is happy too!!! 🐕</Text>

We loved the fact that dog days offers a free day to see how your pet will do in the environment. They also extend a report card for the day. We were able to book on short notice on Memorial Day weekend. The drop off and pick up is seamless. Our dog was so happy and has already recognized Dog days as her fun place. I’m glad we found it and feel relieved that our dog has a new home away from home.<//Text>

<review>Our pup loves this place.  Like that it is a one-stop situation.  Can pick our pup up bathed and nails clipped at the end of the day.  Have even boarded her and she did very well...and she probably would have stayed there forever.< /review>< Name>

Cooper was excited once he got there and ran off immediately to go play. The employees there are so nice and he was soooo tired once we got home and has been sleeping ever since! We’re very happy to have found you guys. Thanks for the great day and Cooper will see you this week. 😁<//Text>

<text>The best daycare for my Pittie! They use a grinder for her nails and they always come out short and perfect! We've been going to the downtown location since 2014, and was sad to see them move to PB, but it is worth the drive because their staff are ALWAYS friendly and inviting. They also post pictures on their Facebook daily and videos on Instagram! I refuse to take Ginger anyw---no, wait. Ginger refuses to go anywhere else!!< /text>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><user>115825247782426059329< /user><Review>My 10 month old puppy, Archie,, and had his first day here today. I was apprehensive at first because I'd never left my dog anywhere before. The receptionist was so sweet and helpful and answered all my first timer questions with kindness and understanding.  They then took my dog for a 15 minute behavior analysis before officially allowing him to stay. I really love that they do this. It ensures that all the dogs at this daycare are friendly. They sent a report card of Archie's day to my email and posted pictures on Facebook. They really want parents to know how their furbabys are doing and that's what I like about this place. My puppy is taking a well needed nap after a fun filled day! I will definitely be bringing him back here!< /Review>< Time>

I've been taking my dog here for almost 10 years now and can always trust he'll come back happy. The staff is always friendly and responsive with questions or concerns. When I added a puppy to the pack, bringing him here has provided him with socialization and helped boost his confidence.< /Text>

Love Dog Days approach and felt like I could trust them to keep an eye on the center of our household.

Came for the first free day, our dog had a blast. She has some separation anxiety and has trouble relaxing when we aren't around. The staff were great, they explained the temperament test and were responsive throughout the day to any concerns anxious parents may have. It would have been nice to have a camera to ease our own worries, but stories and photos on their instagram helped. The end of the day report card was also great to reassure us about how she's doing developmentally and how she's tolerating daycare. She didn't end up sleeping on her usual home schedule, and crashed after we got home. She was super excited to see us again, but seemed happy rather than stressed. We did a full day, and we plan on being back.</review>

Cooper was excited once he got there and ran off immediately to go play. The employees there are so nice and he was soooo tired once we got home and has been sleeping ever since! We’re very happy to have found you guys. Thanks for the great day and Cooper will see you this week. 😁<//Text>

I've been taking my dog here for almost 10 years now and can always trust he'll come back happy. The staff is always friendly and responsive with questions or concerns. When I added a puppy to the pack, bringing him here has provided him with socialization and helped boost his confidence.</Review>

My 10 month old puppy, Archie,, and had his first day here today. I was apprehensive at first because I'd never left my dog anywhere before. The receptionist was so sweet and helpful and answered all my first timer questions with kindness and understanding.  They then took my dog for a 15 minute behavior analysis before officially allowing him to stay. I really love that they do this. It ensures that all the dogs at this daycare are friendly. They sent a report card of Archie's day to my email and posted pictures on Facebook. They really want parents to know how their furbabys are doing and that's what I like about this place. My puppy is taking a well needed nap after a fun filled day! I will definitely be bringing him back here!<//Text>

The best daycare for my Pittie! They use a grinder for her nails and they always come out short and perfect! We've been going to the downtown location since 2014, and was sad to see them move to PB, but it is worth the drive because their staff are ALWAYS friendly and inviting. They also post pictures on their Facebook daily and videos on Instagram! I refuse to take Ginger anyw---no, wait. Ginger refuses to go anywhere else!!<//review>

My dog loved her first day at Dog Days and I’m very pleased as well. The staff was so friendly, welcoming and professional that the transition into a new daycare was easy as could be. I loved getting the midday report: it was obvious they had kept a close eye on how she was adjusting and it couldn’t have gone better. Thank you, Dog Days! My pup and I are going to love our winter in PB!< /text>

Our pup Capri loves camp! Even after a half day she is zonked for the day. While she only goes every once in awhile she has been going since she was a little puppy, and the workers comment on how big she’s gotten. Makes us feel good that they take the time to get to know each pup.<//Review>

Came here for a test day and was recommended by another boarding location because they were all booked up. Bea (my 2.5 yr old pup) is really particular about new people which they confirmed, but were very patient. She warmed up to some I believe. I was told I'd get a call in the afternoon and will see pics of her on their IG/FB pages, but didn't get/see either.
Did get a report card and was relieved to see she at least made 1 friend. She hasn't been to a boarding place in over a year due to covid so she may have been very scared that I left her and was overly excited when I came to pick her up. Might have to do a couple more day sessions to see how she does before we commit to a overnight stay which is what I'm looking for in case we have travel plans where we can't take her.</review>

My pups favorite place to spend an afternoon! She literally tries to jump out of the car when we pull into the parking lot. Staff are extremely friendly.

So this place is a godsend. We rescued a 6 month old puppy and started her here for needed reprieves. Much like everyone else has said Dog Days does it really well on all accounts. The staff is always amazing. Super service oriented, personable, knowledgeable and kind. The cost for half days and full days is so reasonable. They are so consistent and our dog Zen just loves going here. She never looks back when I take her. Many of the folks that go to the nearby dog park take their dogs here. Their first time intake process is thoughtful and caring to ensure good and safe experiences for all that use their service. Would not hesitate to send your puppy here. It’s clear the ownership is detail oriented and great at oversight and training. Love you guys. Martha, Michael and Zen.</text>

I take Gryffin for the socialization aspect and he loves it. I love it because he comes home feeling tired and well socialized. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly! I enjoy seeing the pictures and videos on Instagram of all the pups as well!<//review>

My husband and I have taken our dog Reagan to Dog Days since we got her a little less than a year ago based on a recommendation from our dog trainer and we couldn't be happier with the services they offer and the care they take when watching her. The staff is friendly, patient, and always takes time to answer any and all questions I have. They've taken the time to get to know my dog and really watch what she likes, doesn't like, how she plays with others, and what her personality is like.

We first started taking our dog here two times a week for half a day (for about a month) to get more socialization in. Now my husband and I take her at least once a week for a full day and we couldn't be happier with the service they offer to our pup. No matter what area I live in San Diego, I will ALWAYS take my dog here.< /text>

Our 6 month old puppy appeared happy and tired when we picked her up.  I appreciated getting a thorough report on how she did her 1st day. Employees seem to really care for the dogs</review>

We have three dogs, all three have different needs and temperaments and they all do great at Dog Days. Our husky has been going there since 2012 when he was a puppy. Before we started taking him to Dog Days I was nervous about leaving him with people I did not know. My mind set immediately changed on his first day. The staff is very attentive, responsive and caring. The owners are knowledgeable and always have the dogs' best interest in mind. We would never take them anywhere else.<//review>

I have two very  mischievous rescue dogs.  Before I found Dog Days they tore up my couch, my pillows, their dog beds, the trash cans, my yard, etc.
Now they spend their days well supervised and happy while I am at work. The staff at Dog Days is awesome! They keep me informed of any problems and offer excellent care and concern for all their animals.  The staff is very knowledgeable, friendly, and responsive.  I highly recommend them for the care of any furry friend.</Review>

<text>I’ve been bringing my dogs here for ten years (let’s be honest, Dog Days has been picking my dogs up and bringing them to play for ten years) and I will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Even at their advanced ages at this point, they love the exercise, and I owe my sanity to Tammy, Jeff, and the Dog Days crew. My fur babies are in great hands! (Ask me about the time my dogs moved to Dog Days for three weeks and looked out my back car window longingly as we drove away to go home!) If you’re looking for a home away from home for your dogs, this is it.</text>< Pics>

Dog days goes above and beyond my expectations for a doggy daycare. The staff are always pleasant to interact with and are attentive to the dogs at all times. I received a very detailed report about my puppy’s first day which let’s me know that the staff actually pay attention to each and every dog all day long. I love That I can check their Instagram during the day to see what my puppy is up to. I found dog days by mistake and I’m so glad I did!</Review>

We love Dog Days! We are a military family who moves around often and whenever we are back in good ol’ San Diego, whether on vacation for 2 weeks visiting family or temporary duty for a year, we bring our bulldog, Rocky here. He loves the employees and all his doggy friends he’s come and played with the past 7+ years. The employees are very knowledgeable and friendly. We are sad to be leaving Dog Days again, but if/when we come visit San Diego we will definitely be bringing Rocky back even if for a day or two. Thank you!< /Review>

We've been taking our furchild here for almost 2 years now and have never had any issues. The staff and owner are awesome people who do a great job making you feel welcomed and are always so happy to see our pup when we drop her off (as crazy as she can be).
The only suggestion we have would be to offer a live webcam feature so we're able to check-in every once in a while...many other doggie daycares have this feature and it would be nice to have this option at Dog Days as well.

But overall we can't complain, 5-stars without any hesitation.< /text>

Today was my 4.5 month old pup’s first day at doggie day care and first extended time away from home and us. The staff at Dog Days put me at ease and his daily report card was detailed, super sweet, and written with care. You can tell Dog Days absolutely loves their dogs and my lil puppers had a blast!</review>

The staff is very knowledgeable and caring for the dogs. When I ask questions in person or via email, they take the time to answer fully and never make me feel like I am taking up too much of their time even when I feel I do! Their temperament test is thorough and I believe they are watching the pups very closely. The ratio of handler to dog is much higher than other day care facilities and I completely trust that my dog is safe and loved when staying at Dog Days. Thank you Daniel and Tammy for all of the information and help! We will see you again soon!< /review>

< Review>
My girlfriend and I took our 1 yr old husky there to test the waters for daycare because of an upcoming trip. The staff is super nice and Tammy was there who has plenty of experience with Huskies herself. After about 5 hours, we got a very detailed report via email explaining how our husky had behaved and interacted through the day. When we picked her up, Tammy had videos and pictures to show us which helped us feel more comfortable about her care. Then we actually got to see our husky and she looked like she legitimately had the time of her life. We'll definitely be going back.</Review>

Best doggie daycare in all of SD! The staff are incredible and they truly understand dog behaviour. I trust that when my dogs are there, they are well taken care of and that all the humans are aware of what to look for when it comes to "dog language". I appreciate that they split the bigs and littles up and do wellness checks to make sure that my dogs are healthy. It's also incredibly helfpul that they trim nails. Simply the best in the business! :)))< /Text>

<review>I was invited to eat here this past weekend. They had a set menu of various street tacos, beans, rice, etc. I was really pleased with my experience.  The food was very good and well seasoned, the staff was friendly and accommodating. The manager/owner was friendly and busting tables.  The bartender was knowledgeable and fixed great drinks. I plan to go back soon - I hear they have live music at night.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c332e1f8748637:0x8738cec79674e6cf<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I'm having my baby shower here this month I can't wait. Went to a food tasting and the food is amazing! The pork carnitas and pork Chile Verde 👌🤤 it just falls apart in your mouth. Excellent venue place I'm glad I found it. The owner is super chill to talk to and a very honest man. Thank you 😀!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIntjiB60nMOVNJvYzBRga7ukhpNi9O_gK6R2J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzqvDd3v9qKm9_HvSkP0ZSYJAkJpEHoFgVlwKC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNoHVHdCGC7Q0tBmtBenmyEkxtmYjEY6nVso4H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb_votubTMn_s6SyaXzIqO7NRvi9DOLMuqom_E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMciPnUZtzShT3rAsAd0tHrMP0TWlOAO6Qr9JP5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiey_cf7dlGHzfzMPoCuQ0ARjnFuTNVYoIQvZy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuHVIPeMghS7-rNcH5zTGP-B2r8aJoS4okL40T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMc3t5u1ywTl_Zk9xnWh2oz1wd41ws5EZqZXTSK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Some of the best Mexican food I have had in long time! it is a nice quiet place perfect for a Sunday breakfast. I suggest the 2 enchiladas plate and add 2 eggs it is a personal favorite of mine. This place is perfect for parties or even just a couple of people getting some food. They have a full bar with liquor and beer on tap.</review>

Had my wedding reception there and Jorge went out of his way to make sure everything was right. Very elegant table settings and the food was absolutely delicious. All my guest had a great time and loved the food. Thank you again Jorge.<//text>

Nice atmosphere, great food, very unique location for special events. ...  Since Covid19 guidelines were put in effect, it is remarkable how the owner of this establishment has re-invented his business to continued success. The to-go orders are always more then expected with a personal touch and a new found eclectic culinary flavor that has you wanting more. Order once or everyday of the week and you will always receive an exquisite meal.< /review>

The restaurant was nice and clean. We had a private party and it was decorated very nice. Food was okay beans were really really runny. I feel the staff could have been more attentive to the guests and the restrooms probably should have checked  throughout the event and things restocked.<//Text>

Wow what a diamond in the rough! Such a nice place to have your small get together, wedding or any function where you would like to have a celebration.  The food was delicious,  the drinks from the bar were great even though I got a virgin pina colada it was so refreshing! If you have not gone you should take the time to check it out.  I am in a wheelchair and the customer service was amazing. So accommodating! Which i love.</Text>

<user>107748210575460688890<//user><review>Empty & Eerie. When I walked into this ghost town you could hear the record scratch & a pin drop. Probably a great place on a regular because the 4-5 people who were there obviously knew each other and the employees very well.
I ordered the taquitos as an appetizer and I didn't bother ordering dinner or finishing my appetizers. I will give it another shot though. Most people deserve a second chance.
And a couple pool tables would definitely drive more business in.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>Andrea Dargo (Awesome)<//name>< GmapID>

<Text>So a friend told us about this place said they have the best carnitas nachos he has ever had, well I've been here twice and I still haven't tried them. See well in my defense both times we've been here its been on a Tuesday, Taco Tuesday  to be exact so their a $1 ea. Or you can go for the combo special of a plate of 3 tacos with rice and beans for $5.99. The meats you gets to choose from are carne asada, chicken and carnitas, for the Tuesday's deals. These tacos are very delicious.
So obviously we need to return on a different day so we can try different things besides only these three tacos lol. But so far so good.< /Text>< date>

<review>Definitely the best spot to have some drinks, unwind and enjoy good conversation witj fellow patron's. Menu is simple, yet it always hits home and with the happy hour specials, you just can never go wrong with Topos.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c332e1f8748637:0x8738cec79674e6cf<//GmapID></record>

< Review>
Love this park.  The only wish I have would be some shade over thr play structures.  It's apparent that a lot of thought went into the design as it accommodates so many age groups and abilities.  The picnic areas are awesome and so much green space to accommodate running.  Lots of paved path for my nearly 2 year old granddaughter to ride her scooter - she LOVES this park!</Review>

<Review>They remodeled this park and it's great.  With rubber matting and about 20 different things kids can climb, bounce, rock, and slide on.  Bonus there are 3 musical instruments to play with.  Lots of trees and 4 park tables.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Great park.  Excellent play area for the kids, nice share from surrounding trees.  Nice barbecue setups with picnic tables (2 barbecue areas).

Could really use a bathroom or Porta potty (would give it 5 stars)<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Took my grandson and daughter to this park which all my children played at as small children. They have a few good trees for photos there. There were tiny little miniature pinecones. This park is nice and usually you are all alone there. Clean. Fun. I recommend it for a fun afternoon. There's shade and good choices for playground equipment, picnic tables, water fountain. Nice park.<//review>

This is a very nice neighborhood park with children's playground equipment set up in a pirate theme. There are a few large trees for shade and lots of lawn. There are picnic tables and barbecue pits. It has plenty of parking and you can enter the park from two different streets. Overall it is a very nice park to bring the kids to use the equipment or just play in the grass.< /review>

Last time I was here they didn't have tables outside but today they had 3 tables and two benches outside. I really like how they got the tables outside. They are also on Uber Eats so if it is too hot to go out but you want to enjoy Rita's you can have Uber deliver for you~! make sure you use $10 off your first meal with promo code from Uber Eats. I love their Custards and Gelati. Employees are kind and always smiling.</Text>

It was disappointing.  The blended custard I got had a nauseating amount of caramel and peanut butter in it.  I ended up throwing half of it away.< /text>

Terrific stylists all around. My kids and I visit Gloss and have never been disappointed. What I love is that if we can't get an appointment with our regular stylists, I can book on-line for the time I need, and choose the option 'book with any available stylist,' and still end up with a great cut. Love them!</text>

This gem was hard to find, because I was not familiar with the area, but most definitely worth the travel. It’s location is efficient with shops and restaurants surrounding to be able to plan out errands adding to getting pampered beauty salon  services done. The salon was energetic and welcoming with pleasant employee staff. The beginning process of my hair transformation Cheyenne has performed truly made me feeling glamorous with the foils weren’t even taken out. I absolutely won the lottery meeting Cheyenne and finding this salon that has superstar dust when you leave feeling a little celebrity like, because of each stylist dedication to their clients. 💯🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟< /Text>

I’ve never been disappointed and have gotten a lot of compliments on my hair. She is also very kind and a nice person to talk to! The salon is a nice, clean, and calm environment.

I trust Devyn at Gloss to keep my pixie cut looking stylish. She is meticulous and artful in her hair design. The salon itself is cute, super clean, and conveniently located. My daughters have used various stylists here to cut their long hair, and they have always been pleased with the experience and the results.<//Text>

Gloss is a first-class salon. My stylist really listens to my feedback and somehow, always creates the perfect look to frame my face. I’m confident using any of their products as I know they’re all cruelty-free and will help my hair stay healthy and shiny for as long as possible.<//review>

Because of my crazy work schedule and life logistics I realized I was going to have to start the daunting task of finding a new hair salon.  This was pre covid. Leaving my stylist of 15 years was not an easy decision, especially since we are friends, I loved everything about how he did my hair and I love him.  I was extremely anxious about finding someone new.  As fate would have it, the answer was a mere two miles from my home.
I happened to walk into Gloss salon seeking a simple blowout. What I walked away with was my new salon, stylist and an incredible new look. Serena M. had extra time and was able to do a full haircut instead of just a blowout. She quickly set my mind at ease with her professionalism, calm and soothing demeanor.  She embraces styling with a youthful enthusiasm that is contagious. I mentioned some changes I was considering and her excitement won me over.
I can't say enough good things about my stylist and this salon. Everyone is very kind, they have a nice selection of natural products available and they've recently remodeled.  The salon has a cozy, friendly feel about it.  Their prices are standard, and I didn't feel any sticker shock with the services provided.
If you follow Gloss on social media you will be impressed with their before/after transformations.</Text>

After a disappointing last haircut, I had a great experience with the owner to get this resolved. They fixed my hair free of charge and the stylist did a great job, I'm quite pleased with the results. I will definitely be giving this salon another chance - they clearly value their clients and reputation.<//Text>

<Text>I had a wonderful haircut experience with Serena M. My friend referred me to Gloss and Serena, and I am so glad she did!
From the moment I sat down, Serena listened and was extremely professional. She knew exactly what to do in order to tackle my unruly, wavy/curly hair that hadn’t been cut since before Covid hit. Serena gave me an awesome new cut that I will be able to to style straight or curly with confidence. The salon was clean, newly remodeled and I felt very comfortable!</Text>< pics>

You threatened a bad review which is ridiculous to use a bad review as some kind of leverage.

I liked the hair color result.  I was scheduled for a root color touch up and bang trim, no blow dry or styling.
According to the webpage the fee was 75-90 for touch up, gloss and styling. My bill was 130, more than
I’ve ever been charged.  When I asked the receptionist at check out she said that’s what my stylist wrote
down.  I sent two emails to the salon/owner asking about the charge and finally heard back a month later when
I responded to an appointment reminder.  The salons policy is the webpage only lists starting prices.  I
find this and the delay in any response unacceptable, too bad a simple apology answering my emails in a timely way and transparent pricing would have kept me as a customer, so simple<//text>

I didn't like the haircut at all. Spent $60 but got $15 haircut!  The reason I chose this one because it has good reviews and expensive! Very disappointing! Now I'm waiting my hair to grow longer to get it fixed somewhere else!<//text>

I decided to try this salon due to its location and reviews. A few days before, I had my hair cut at a different salon and was unhappy with the result. I booked at Gloss and got in with Devyn. She is a lovely young lady and I appreciate how she listened to me. I told her about my unpleasant haircut and what I was hoping to get. Devyn cut a little then asked what I thought. She kept checking with me throughout the whole process. She could tell by my reaction that I wanted to go shorter and thinner. She kept cutting until I was finally satisfied. I left with the cut/style I was hoping for and my husband reacted positively the moment I walked in the door at home. His words were "now that's the haircut for you!". I like that the salon is small and cozy and that standards for the protection of COVID were not only posted but evident in practice. My experience with Devyn really made my day and I look forward to returning and using her services again.</Review>

<review>I have been more than pleased with the work Michael has done with my hair. He does such an awesome job at cutting and styling. I have long hair with layers which tended to lose its style after about 2 weeks of getting it cut in the past.  But with Michael, he cuts my hair in such a way that grows out nicely and holds a style much longer that I need only get my hair cut every six months!</review><user_id>100826377471360636391</user_id><user_name>Lorelyn Shannon<//user_name>< Response>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I am new to Gloss Hair Studio, and had a haircut and color gloss with Krystina today. She absolutely nailed it! I often find it takes a time or two for me to find a groove with a stylist but that was not the case today. She created exactly what I was envisioning and then some! This studio has great energy, a calming vibe, and all around wonderful staff. Highly recommend!</Review><user_name>Danika Solé<//user_name>< pics>

<Text>The salon itself is clean and uncluttered. The owner, the front desk and the professionals with all things hair are full of warmth. I have been to many places where  the staff is friendly but here it feels sincere.
My daughters and I started going to this salon after following our favorite hair pro, Michael. We haven’t worked with anyone else yet but have observed the work they do while we are there for our appointments with Michael. From what I can see, they produce beautiful results and again, I really like how they treat their customers.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Do yourself a favor and schedule hair and makeup with ULTA across the street.  I had a terrible experience at Gloss, both in preparation and on the day of my wedding in October 2019. I made reservations for myself and a handful of family/bridesmaids for hair and makeup when I was first wedding planning in May and my appointments were randomly canceled and re-confirmed for months. I was receiving text messages every couple months with reminders for more appointments than I had made. Then when I would call, the receptionist could not confirm my appointments until I started calling daily in September.

I had a practice makeup/hair appointment in July and the gals who did my hair weren't even present on the day of the wedding. No one gave me an explaination for if they left or were fired...the lack of professionalism was astounding. Additionally, the price for my makeup  as the bride was triple that of everyone else, so I was forced to cancel my makeup appointment 1 week before the wedding.  They also acted like opening up at 9am instead of 10am was a huge deal.
I would never go back, not even for a blow out.</text>

<Review>Michael did a fantastic job! He spent time really listening to what I wanted and was careful to express back to me what he heard me say - as well as add his recommendations. Both the color/highlights and haircut he gave me were all superb. I highly recommend Michael and will most surely be back.< /Review><user_name>Jeni Kay< /user_name><gmap_id>0x80dbf6e2949e90a9:0x6718d999c7e36f99< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

My hair has never looked better after 49 years than it does now. Thanks to Holly at Gloss salon who knows blondes better than anybody. The Kevin Murphy product line offered there is the best I’ve ever used. Well done Gloss salon, where have you been all my life!< /text>

Beautiful salon and very friendly staff!  I’ve gotten my hair colored and cut by Krystina and she is wonderful!  I’ve been taking my hair blonde, and she not only gives me what I want but does it in a way that will keep the integrity of my hair and keep it as healthy as possible.  She really cares about the health of your hair!  Only reason I didn’t give the salon 5 stars is because it’s a bit pricey - but you do get what you pay for!</text>

Gloss Hair Studio is by far the best salon experience I have ever had! From the minute I walked through the door, I felt at home. The receptionist offered me tea and I sat on a gorgeous sofa.

My experience at Gloss was wonderful. My stylist Devyn was so nice and gave me suggestions for my fine blonde hair. She really made me feel comfortable and confident. Not only is she a great stylist but she really knows her products as well. She recommended some Kevin Murphy products to me and I love them. 10/10 would recommend this salon!<//Review>

I had an amazing experience with my color, wash, and style by Angela! My hair turned out exactly how I wanted it to, and I will definitely go back for another hair service.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I love Cyrena! She’s an amazing colorist and master hairstylist. She recommended a color change this time and I’m so happy we did it, I love it!

I’ve been going to Cyrena for many years and of course followed her when she became the owner of Gloss! The salon is pretty inside and I always feel comfortable when I’m there.

I schedule an appointment every 4 weeks and love my experience every single time. Thank you Cyrena :)< /text>< pictures>

I've been coming here to get my nails done by Peter and Helen since I was a kid. They've always been great! They perform high quality work and have always had great prices. And, their flower work is on past! I always get french tip and the lines are even and flawless each time! Plus, their eyebrow service is great.</text>

<Text>Very nice and welcoming. Good deal on gel nails $25. They have a large selection of colors to choose from. I went on lunch during the week and even though I called to make an appointment I really didn't need to as there was no wait. Huge TV and the pedicure chairs looked nice. Very convenient and the staff was very nice.<//Text>< Pics>

I really like this place but the prices just keep going up for what you get. I could pay $10 more and get a better service somewhere else. Prices were $12 now it's $20 for a basic pedicure with no extras. I'm thinking about looking for something better now sadly. I really like the staff.<//review>

Horrible. I asked for “ombré” and sat there for three hours (even made an appointment three weeks in advance). This was for my wedding! Completely horrible and zero empathy from them. My nails looked scary and I had to get them re - done :(</Review>

<review>I have been going to magic nails for almost 20 years now. I have never had a bad experience.  Peter and Helen with the rest of the staff are like family. I have very particular taste on how I want my nails done. I always like to have Helen put designs on my nails, and I am never disappointed. They also are very affordable.  I will continue to go and get my nails done.< /review>< Time>

Love this place! Best pedicures (& for a reasonable price - $20) in town! I always go here when i need assistance with my personal grooming, bc the ladies who work here are kind and friendly. Pperhaps a they can be a little shy at first, but once they get to know you, its a treat to be pampered here!</Review>

< Review>
I had a pedicure here two years ago. It was my second pedicure ever. It was fine. I decided to treat my friend to a pedicure for her birthday. She has gone here in the past. We tried to go two weeks ago and sat down. About 10 mins later and two different people they told my friend they could not do a pediacure. She was losing a nail due to a large pot hitting the nail. We came back two weeks later after the nail fell off and was healing. A new nail growing in with no open wound. A lady looked at my friend, then my feet and left saying nothing. About 5 fo 10 mins  later she
said they could not do her nails. We left sad and went to Escape nail and spa. What a difference! They place a plastic cover over the bath water tub for each customer. It keeps it sanitary.They did a long pedicure and I was in heaven. Now I know what a pedicure really is. Sometimes a bad thing happen s that leads to a heavenly experience. We will go to Escape nail and spa again.</Review>

The staff is professional and takes their time to do a great job.  My nails always look good and I've never gotten an infection.  Moreover, the polish lasts a good long while.  Prices are reasonable.< /review>

<Review>This place is the worst !! Do not get your nails done here . It was my first and last time getting my nails done here . The lady completely rushed me and my husband's pedicure. She didn't even cut my nails . My toenail was uneven , instead of cutting it down and shaping it she applied the gel polish to my skin . Worst service ever .</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808e1542a8b7e607:0x1a8ef5e348646ad6<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Never go to this place. I have been going there for a while now but when i came to get my nail fixed Helen went on my phone. Peter was incredibly rude and all the staff are really pushy. If i could give you zero stars i would. Stop pushing your customers around. You guys should get a clue and leave your customers alone and  stop being so pushy. Also you guys would make my nails a thick even though i didnt asked. And also when i say no i dont want to get my phone fixed if means no. When a customer says no it MEANS NO. STOP BEING SO PUSHY. ALSO STOP TALKING SMACK ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS TO YOUR OTHER COWORKERS IN YOUR LANGUAGE.  I have been getting my nails done there for a long time now but when i come in with only my friend the staff was really rude and then they toke my money from me.* I was getting my nail fixed and it ususally free if the nail polish cips off or falls offs*  Like who does that.< /Review>

It's always great to find a place that not only has good prices, but the techs WILL listen to you when you want something done a certain way. They also have a "frequent visitor" promo card, so ask for one of those<//Review>

<review>Overall they do a very good mani and pedi and the atmosphere is peaceful  (the instrumental music and scenic pictures on the tv screens).
However, the service could of been a heck of alot better...

The woman doing my mani thought it needful for I don't know what reason, to show me and point out twice the amount of dead skin from my cuticles/fingers. If that wasn't enough, the woman doing lifted the pedi tool she was using to the other woman (who was doing my mani) and spoke to her in her native language. The 'mani woman' showed her her mani tool with the skins, in reply. (That's 3 times, lady!).
REALLY? ?!! I am positive I am not the only woman around with dry skin/or alot of it!
You would think that in this business they see alot of that and it really shouldn't be no big surprise. I didn't need to understand their language to know the communications between them ("Action speaks louder than words).
There needs to be a little more tact and professionalism!

I normally get my nails done elsewhere, but since I was in Capitola to shop, I thought I'd try Magic Nails while out here. Never again, I
don't need people who are supposed to be professional in their trade to be critical while servicing. I shop out here often, could of been "a regular", but they lost a potential customer.<//review>< Pics>

Is good taste of meat the tortilla is a good size the only thing I don't understand why the tacos don't coming with the normal condiments like onion,cilantro and more. Is a good tacos another thing is why like customers we have to pay the fee for use card for me is like we paying the fee the bank charge the business to used the system. I think this happened is California.</Review>

We had the steak picado burrito and it was packed with flavor. Not to spicy but had a little bit of heat.

My wife got 3 carnitas tacos and 1 shrimp taco and the were some good size tacos with 2 tortillas each.

This is a family owned business and is on point.

The only thing I didn't like was the red salsa. It wasn't hot enough and didn't have enough flavor.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

First visit, will have to come back at least 2 more times. Overall score 4.4, but due to unusual circumstance deserved 5 stars.
Let me explain, Covina has some real gems when it comes to Mexican food, and this unassuming shop is one. It is hidden, good luck seeing it from the street. Parking isn't good, COVID tent doesn't help, will be better when restrictions end. (County CDC guidelines are posted very visibly, excellent job there).  It is not an easy location to get to heading north or west. No bathrooms that I saw. Parking, counter, seating are all accessible.
As for the food, outstanding. Do not take a date here as your first stop, when the date is nearly over and you're both hungry cause it went really well and you didn't eat anything cause you were too nervous, then come here for food, trust me your date will love it. If the date didn't go well, drop them off and come here by yourself, at least you will get some good food at a good price. Staff are phenomenal, beyond helpful, if the food wasn't great would still come back at least one more time. Food was prepared quickly and exceeded my expectations. The breakfast burrito was good, as were the asada and carnitas tacos. Breakfast burrito uses fries which are fine, but combo that with the fries for asada fries, you will have something amazing. Tried the chile verde too, was very good, could have used a slightly stronger kick with the chile, but just add some green sauce. The tacos were a little oily, but not in a bad way, breakfast burrito was not oily at all. Beans were good. Will return for a Chile Verde, Colorado, and a Steak Picado burrito in the future. Also need to try the rice. Looking forward to next visit. Highly recommend obviously.<//text>

I was introduced to omanas a few years ago and fell in love instantly. The Asada street tacos are amazing,  not the typical street taco tho. Theres no onion/cilantro. They used to drown in sauce.  But its skimpy now.    But since the s. El monte location closed, the recipe for the red chili sauce isn't quite the same. Even when they cooked in the  truck parked in the parking lot, it was on point.  Didn't look appealing, but it was always well worth it! The loavatipn across the street from the high school is good, but I prefer the w. Covina spot now.<//review>

As for me and my family, we really enjoy the food here. As I mentioned before, it is a little bit different than the usual taco place. If you like to try new foods and your not a finicky eater, I believe you'll enjoy it here!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c328545eec139f:0x80b16cb551f55824</gmap_id></record>

Had asudden craving for a taco after leaving the nearby Bank of America. Google maps brought me to the end of a strip mall around the corner and introduced me to this fabulous little taco joint. I had two shrimp tacos which were to die for! Will be coming back to sample other items in their menu!< /text>

Really really disappointed. The food here is really good. However I bought a gift certificate and when I came to use it I was told they had a new register and couldn't accept it. When I asked with him he said, besides only a manager can give a discount on the register. We were regular customers before. Will never return.</review>

had some amazing tacos today from this place that I found by myself.   These tacos are delicious carne asada tacos in red salsa and  Carnitas in green salsa the tortillas taste like they are hand made. Left me wanting more.

They also make a kick butt burrito Chicharrones con Chile verde  I randomly found them online and I was calling them personally to find out how they prepare Their pork rinds in Chile This is a very tasty burrito if it's done correctly And when I called I spoke to a lady named Debbie our conversation went on she convinced me and it's family recipe and I came through that night to purchase my burrito of  Chicharrón con chile  All I can say that it tastes like a little piece of heaven to me my mother used to make   This for us. She is no longer with us but it almost felt like he send me to the right place so thank you Debbie I was very satisfied I was happy I called back  To try other things in your menu and I met your son Michael over the phone he was a delight like you were even though you don't know me you made me feel welcomed and I wanted to say thank you I think I found my new Mexican place who knew you were around the corner I've been living in the city for 20 years and I just not discover you're amazing authentic Mexican food A your father should be very proud of you to keeping his legacy. God-bless thank you again.</text>

So disappointed! The chile is not the same. Still a decent taco, but the legendary taco is gone.</text>

<Review>Their Soft Carnitas Tacos are To Die For. Best Soft Carnitas Tacos I've Ever Tasted. And the Green Salsa that comes inside the tacos is the Best Green Salsa I've Ever Tasted. These tacos are so so so good, that I'm going to go get some right now. And the people that work there so nice. It's a little far away from me but it's worth the trip.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Horrible Customer Service! If I could leave zero stars I would. The staff here is rude, especially when you tell them they didn’t do your order correctly. It is obvious they are unhappy with their job. The second reason is this place is dirty. If you want a good taco place I suggest you take a drive down to El Sauz in Glendale, California. The people there great you with a smile and will not mess up your order.< /Text>

<text>Poor service, cashier has a bit of a snotty attitude. They charge extra for sour cream. I asked for my salsa on the side but they didn't bother to give me any. So I had to go back and ask for it, even after paying them for sour cream. Shrimp tacos were good. Chicked tacos were nothing special. No reason to go back.<//text>< rating>

My mother really likes this place she has bought food from them many time we are regular customers I would say and they always mess up on the order like I’m sure my mom will still do business here but this place lost my business I’m tired of them not following directions they don’t even give you the right kind of receipt they should give you the break down bit just the amount $ they charged you but I think this is a horrible place thank you for reading my reviews</review>

I loved tacos omañas for years but they are so stingy with their lime or lemons whatever you wanna call it. You ask them for some and they give you a half piece cut up into 4 tiny pieces... you Ask for more because obviously my order is for more than one person and they always tell me they’re gonna see if they have more... it’s ridiculous.. you own a damn successful restaurant to be so stingy omañas...!!! Idk if that’s the boss or the workers there ... so my suggestion ... bring your own limes to this restaurant LOL< /Text>

Ordered two carne asada burritos.
But In reality, they were bean burritos with a little carne asada and red sauce added. I saw tacos others had ordered and they were small  with double thick tortillas
Attendant was brash.
My credit card didn't read the first time.
He commented, there's no money on your card.
Seemed Hurried, cold, poor people skills.<//Text>

But the lady was so friendly and nice and even offered us a side of rice for free while waiting for our order since my 2year old was a little fussy. The food came with this chips, salsa, and beans plate and ir was AMAZING!!! i will be coming back for sure!!! Mistakes happen, ill just be sure to check my food next time.

Decent food, decent price, but around here, where good Mexican food is abundant, decent isn't good enough. VERY RUDE!! VERY SLOW!!
To summarize, if you want decent, slow, rude-mex that's impossible to get in and out of(parking). Tacos Omanis is your spot.< /text>

<Review>A couple people strongly recommended this place. The food was okay, but it didn't meet expectations. Personal preference perhaps, but the beans seemed kind of soupy to be in a burrito. Also, the carne asada was all piled at one end. Kinda makes for a bad burrito.</Review><Date>1538259099264<//Date><name>Arthur McCandless</name><Rating>3<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

The "Original" carne asada tacos are out of this world!! I have also tried these other dishes in the previous years; fish tacos, tacos al pastor, Chile relleno burrito it is all fabulous. And the service is fantastic!!!</Text>

These are some awesome tacos! I tried the carnitas, asada and fish tacos. All excellent.

Be careful when taking to go, it gets packed real messy.

They also take cards!<//review>

<Review>The California burrito was not your traditional California. It was mainly beans, and the fries and meat were almost non existent. I suggest they  ditch the beans or just remove The California burrito off their menu.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Text>Service was bad, the cashier was rude. Also IMH opinion the food here is not as good as the El Monte location. The only benefit is that there is indoor seating at this location and it doesn't smell. Even so I would rather go to the El Monte location.< /Text>< time>

<Review>Food was ok. But we were told at the time of ordering that there were no fries, nachos or burritos. But people came in after us and ordered all three items and got them. It was our first and most definitely our last time here.</Review>< pics>

Ordered a  chile relleno the first time and it was disgusting.  It was a more like an omellete and didn't taste the chile, it was some other vegetable.  Went there a second time and ordered a shrimp burrito. It was also nasty .It had 3 large shrimp and  a bunch of sour cream, beans and lettuce.  Won't go there again and I don't recommend it.</review>

Very unorganized! Phone orders are like pulling teeth they never pick up, half the time the call never goes thru.  If you show up and order be prepared to wait.  I wish this place didn't suck so much now i literally live 6 houses down the St from then and they were OK in the beginning nothing special but not this horrible.  Go to alfredos at least you will get quick service.</Text>

I asked for tacos dorados and my husband ordered chicharrón. It was greasy, and I say "it" because after the first taco, I couldn't eat any more. I could feel the oil in my mouth and the taste of the meat was disgusting. My husband ate part of my tacos and couldn't sleep all night, he was vomiting and had heart burn. This was the first time I visited the place and for sure the last one.<//Text>

<Text>We used to go to the South El Monte location because their burritos we sooo great!  we personally loved the green chile ore chile verde...Our family raves about everything else on the menu....
The only problem there was that you had to sit outside and no ATM
Now in Covina...Whoo Hoo  there is an ATM and very nice insdie seating (small but still comfortable
I would rate it ***** FIVE STARS.....</Text>< pictures>

Today was not as pleasant as other days. A while back they would give you chips with beans and salsa, it wasn't a large portion but one big enough to take the craving for free. If you ate there, now there's a small fee. Not confortable refills were free, I was afraid to ask.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The truth is that the place is very dirty and they do not have good service. There are no sauces to taste. You have to be asking and of course not all the places have it but they are very poor in sauce they are not good and the vegetable you also have to ask, I do not like it for nothing and I do not recommend this super dirty

(Original)
La verdad esta muy sucio el lugar y no tienen buen servicio no hay salsas al gusto tienes que estar pidiendo y claro no todos los lugares lo tienen pero están muy pobres de salsa no están buenas y la verdura también la tienes que pedir no me gusta para nada y no lo recomiendo esta súper sucio< /Text>< pictures>
