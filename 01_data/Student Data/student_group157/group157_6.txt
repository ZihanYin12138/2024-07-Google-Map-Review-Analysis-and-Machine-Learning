<Review>Nice selection. When I was checking out the cashier asked me if I found everything ok. When I explained I couldn't find 2 items he told me where One was while he had someone get my second item. Very friendly and accommodating also last visit they gave me a case discount for buying a case of celery. I love this store. :-)</Review>< Pics>

Rather odd I posted this less than a half an hour ago Sprouts answers back but their answer was dated 13 hours ago??
now I know this is an automated post and it's not done by a human, very disappointing Sprouts!!
How does that happen Sprouts??🤔🙄</Review>< pictures>

There are always great sales! The freshest produce and the homemade sausages are SO good!! I have shopped Sprouts since they were Boneys. I always shopped in Hemet California. I moved to Washington and the nearest sprouts is 2 1/2 hours away, so when I fly to see my parents in Corona, I always go to Sprouts! I love the coffee beans to grind and I always get at least 2 pounds of the Jamaican blend to bring home!!< /review>

Clean, fresh produce, great customer service. I like to buy my fruits & vegetables here but noticed the prices have gone up. Fuji apple's and Italian squash were priced the same as Vons. Also, their stock seemed low for thin chicken breasts.< /text>

Sprouts always goes the extra mile to accommodate their customers with vast selections of fresh organic fruits and veggies.  They have wonderful vegan options throughout the store shelves, frozen sections and dairy/non dairy cases and the savings continues in their beauty, body and health care departments Everyone working there is friendly and helpful.

I love Sprouts they always have a great selection of produce, organic and conventional and take care of it, other places produce is rotting and still have it their to sell?! They also have sanitizing stations at entrance and throughout the store but most of all employees are always willing to help in fact they come to you and ask if everything is ok!</review>

<review>Nice store with generally a nice caliber of people.  There is probably less and lection than most major grocery stores but there are selections of unique items, which are generally healthier alternatives than what's offered at general grocery stores.

<text>Like a lot of people were trying to eat a little better these days. Lots of fresh regular and organic fruits and vegetables to go around. And to be honest it's priced competitively. But I want to make gyros and they're the closest place to me to get both fresh and frozen (ground)  lamb. They have also put all their bulk nuts, flour, granola ect. in one pound-ish bags. I find that convenient for items we use frequently. If you haven't stopped in do give it a try. And stop by the deli/meat area and pick up something for dinner 👍<//text></record>

< review>
Worrisome trend has struck this location, given it's just behind a retirement community of hundreds that rely on it along with the larger community, their decision to allow workers and visitors to operate without masks and relax their disinfecting regimen as seen in the recent days means it puts vulnerable parts of the community that rely on it for groceries at risk.

Prior to this, the team was fairly dedicated to keeping a clean and stable environment. Either management or corporate has decided that's no longer important judging by what I saw on Tuesday May 26th.

I'll shop elsewhere, hopefully others can spare the extra trek to go somewhere with better standards.<//review>

<review>What an excellent market, truly what we need, a place with fresh, whole, and organic produce and products. I come here when I  search for specific items, or if I'm just in the area and feel like grabbing a few organic fruits and veggies. Great place to find kefir, and raw milk. Awesome selection on kombucha drinks. Plenty of organic, vegan options as well. They have a great selection of items. They even have a supplement area, with plenty of vitamins and nutritional supplements. Let's not forget about their ready to eat food items, such as salads and  sandwiches.

Their staff is always helpful, and willing to go the extra mile to try and help you find something.

The only drawback is that they have a limited parking space lot, the spaces are small, and it is always busy at this particular Sprout's. Other than that, this is a nice clean and organized store.

Take a trip to a Sprout's, you won't be disappointed.<//review>< Pictures>

Hello,
Today I came into the store to take advantage of the buy one get one free sale. When I found the Ancient Nutrition Multi Collagen protein was apart of the promotion but only one left I grabbed it and an Amazing Grass energy. Both items were $47.99 and buy one get one free but they were the only ones left in the store. In a previous visit when I experienced this issue the cashier gave me two options, I could get 50% off or a comparable item. This time the only option I was given by the manager Gabriel was to purchase both items and come back for my free ones. This option would be extremely inconvenient and I explained this to him and about my previous experience to no avail. He absolutely disregarded my previous experience and refused to compromise to improve my shopping experience in any way. Sprouts is very far from home and I mainly come because I enjoy the customer service and how clean the store is but after today I will be taking my money elsewhere.</Review>

I won’t come back to this store for instacart. There is always an item your out of and no replacement for that item. When I can’t replace an item I don’t get my tips.<//review>

I was checking out at the register, the clerk was not friendly did not say hello, just said you have only the two items, so I wanted for the next Customer to be served so the clerk said hi to her did you find everything OK do you need any bags and I got none of that service!! So I called back and spoke to the manager he said she was a new hire first day  on the so  I told him that no excuse but she be  excited to be working 😏<//text>

Good store for supplements and organic food..!!

The one thing that is missing is an inside dining area..???  Am I the only one ☝️ that cares about this..??!!  Whole Foods always has a place to sit and dine..👀

Otherwise, a good place to shop.

The staff is very nice and very helpful. Always like talking to the staff and getting advice or help with finding items..!! 👍

< Review>
Overall this store was similar to other Sprouts. Well stocked but wow...sure busy for a Wednesday evening! I regretted having to use the restroom as it was extremely dirty. Possibly because there were only two and they are the new "shared gender" kind. I would have given five stars but cleanliness desperately needs to be addressed here. It is a safety issue now with the flu  spreading at pandemic rates.</Review>

Why is it that I torture myself coming here. The produce department is so unfriendly, the female cashier's are so so unfriendly especially the younger generation!!! I tell myself maybe the person had a bad day give them another chance, but enough is enough I will never shop here again even if it is more convenient. I would rather drive a little further then to torture myself ever again! I'm done!</Review>

<Review>There are more employees here than shoppers and I had to get attention from deli 2 times before they acknowledged me. They only make their sandwiches on slice bread so I had to purchase a roll separately. I asked for a 50 cents discount, cost of roll and they did ablige.
They did not want to add salt and pepper to my sandwich which was being made but wanted me to take little packets and add it afterwards.
Despite everything the sandwich was good.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1532461636515, 'text': 'Hi Denise, thank you for taking the time to write us a review.

Lalalove this place, the organic product choices are great. Biggest down fall by far the meat (organic) never makes it to the expiration day. I know I always have to cook the meat within the first 2 days 3 if I am lucky.</Review>

The employees are always welcoming here. They always have good sales too. The fruits aren't as thoroughly inspected as Wholefoods so you have to check for mold especially with the berries.</Text>

<Review>Good selection of organic produce. A bit expensive. Employees are helpful and friendly. They know what and where the products are when asked. Employee took my shopping cart when I payed and got my stuff bagged, which really ticked me off. Had to carry heavy bags by hand to my car. Not good for skin condition on the hands</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

If you're a vegan, Sprouts is the place to be. There are so many options beyond tofu and veggies that you could not find at a normal grocery store. Also the vitamins section is jam packed with anything and everything you would ever need.<//Review>

<rate>2<//rate><review>Not a health food store. Henry's or now Sprouts is different at every location. The corona location carries the same processed and non-organic veggies and fruits that all the supermarkets offer. What's worse is that they charge sometimes more for the same low-quality food. They don't carry grass feed beef, nor do they plan to. I stopped going - I'm still looking for an all-organic, grass feed beef grocery store in the corona area.<//review>< Pics>

Really negative experience where cashier practically ignored me, didn't say "hi" or give me any greeting at all, and carried on a conversation with the bagger for the entire length of my transaction.  It really would have changed my feeling about the place had the cashier said anything friendly besides a curt, "is this rhubarb?"</text>

Absolutely in love with the most tasty pizza ever. Location has nice little game room and sports bar. Hospitality is awesome and staff is courteous and respectful. Made online order once and pizza was delivered hot and in time. Full stars to this location, must visit this place if you are a pizza fan. Kudos !!<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>The rudest customer service and a trash of a pizza.
Not the first time that I ordered pizza from this place; pizza alone could get a 2.5* on average.
But this particular time, the service reached an all time low. The pizza delivery got delayed, and when I received it and took out a bite, it was all half baked, soggy, watery and a doughy mess. So much so, I had to take it out of the box on a different tray, pictures attached.
When called the place to leave a feedback, the most shocking customer service was meted out. Instead of just apologizing and accepting the mistake, the person who told his name as Sunny continued on an incessant rude argument. Sunny also said, "we don't care about reviews". That is good to know.
I'm not one taking pains to write a review online, but really had to do this to warn others.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZigSXMBOQ8K3r7dZNz-R3BdhIsmXDaBe3FIlE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5_3x1-SMCb5745ujO_L4ZxqO2c5IWnONneZ24=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808e31f20c88bfdb:0xe78535c5dc22a4b9</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I usually cannot eat any pizza other than Round Table. Usually too much sauce, dough is too chewy, or the ingredients aren't good. But mountain mikes is actually really good! I rate it four stars because round table is still my favorite, but I do know this is just my taste and it doesn't apply to anyone. But Mountain Mike's is definitely worth the cost!< /Review>

<Text>Mike, Wow your Pizza has improved from a three 🌟's. A good to go, small chain local pizza joint... One 🌟 for great service, onother 🌟 for friendly staff.
My Fav, is the combination pizza.
Just the right amount of layers of sauce, cheese, pprni, fresh bell peepers, onions and much more items. But I mean great testing with a nice beer... This place has a nice little bar area that has two TVs to catch up on sports and Pizza with Beer... Cheers.!!< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< pics>

I gotta give this place a 5 star review. I lived in the Blossom Hill area for many years and came to this pizza spot often. After moving and going to other Mountain Mike's in the San Jose area, they do not compare to this place. They have the best pizza. We will drive the extra 10 miles to come back here because we know we are going to get the best. No more disappointments for us. And the customer service is great.<//Text>

My top spot for pizza. You will not be disappointed in the menu and service. Certainly worth a return visit. Prices are decent for the quality. They have so many great reviews for a reason.</Text>

Ordered the buffet as usual but the wait was unbearable. This used to be the best pizza and now its fallen down bad. Their was even hair in the pizza. It's sad to see how these new owners must run this business. Along with the food the bar was unattended for an hour and I could here the gentleman waiting just to get a beer. It truly ashame how bad this restaurant is and the service was HORRIBLE, and when confronting the employee about the hair he could give less of a sh*t. I suggested no one eat here again.</Review>

The place seemed ok and the food was hot and we recieved it fast but the slices were all off and totally huge or super tiny. Was kind of hard to eat. And they had the back door propped open by the small arcade area so it was scary to let the kids play there alone<//Text>

<Text>Usually the pizza and side orders are very good but tonight I don’t know what happened. We ordered  mozzarella sticks,  got home from picking up the order which we gave more than enough time to have ready just to wait they’re even more,  got home and the mozzarella sticks  we’re very undercooked.. cold and the cheese was stiff. The breading was soggy,  and when we called to complain they said there was not much they could do but have us drive all the way back there just so they can cook it for us...... very disappointing</Text><pics>None<//pics><userid>108712488582001597438<//userid>< user_name>

Decent pizza, small but good selection of beers on tap. All you can eat daily lunch buffet and Wednesday night only $6.99.  Usually a good selection of pizza on the all you can eat buffet.  Buffet includes reasonably stocked salad bar.  Friendly staff.</Review>

Always a good experience at this Mountain Mike's sometimes it can get a little crowded during game days but overall a good experience. The owner and staff there is very kind and always has the pizza fresh. We love coming on Wednesdays for all you can eat and always have a great variety and take recommendations for what we like.</text>

I've been here for $6.99 all you can eat pizza & salad bar lunch. The salad bar & toppings were just okay but pizzas included were slow & of lower quality than regular pizza to go! However they have good selection of beers on tap!</Text>

Employees don't use gloves when working with food or making pizza, i see cashiers touching money or pulling up there pants or touching there hair and then touching food with there bare hands. I don't see them cleaning there prepping table when doing pizzas.The salad bar is hideous, it doesn't look fresh, they don't  replace anything. There silverware when they wash it still has dry food particles. This place is gross!!< /text>

<Text>Mountain Mikes on Sunol Blvd is the families go to for delivery pizza.  The pricing is fair and the pizza is very decent.  There have been a few times that our order was messed up, their driver and manager ha e both gone out of their way to correct the issue.(which is all I can ask. They have bent over backwards to fix the problems.)  Which to me is stellar service.(as I am a firm believer in "mistakes happen, how it is resolved is what matters to me.")<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>Gotta say this place sucks cause very rude customer service and yes the pizza was half way cooked. When I tried to let them know, the people there didn't care and just argued with me. I really dont know why this place is still in business since I've notice more and more complains about the same stuff.  Do the CEOs care about this at all?< /review>< Pictures>

I’ve been here a few times and every time I’ve came They are stingy with the ingredient. I’ve given them a few try’s to make my pizza right .bur they continued to disappoint me.
So I started going to another mountain mikes, it’s a bit further but it’s def worth the drive.<//Review>

Im rewriting my review from two years ago and giving this place two stars. We ordered two pizzas and some sides 45 minutes ago. Currently I am waiting for a pepperoni pizza that they screwed up. And, they didnt have my sides ready after we paid for them. Went down hill. Will go to the Monterey spot next time.<//Review>

We ordered two pizzas and some sides 45 minutes ago. Currently I am waiting for a pepperoni pizza that they screwed up. And, they didnt have my sides ready after we paid for them. Went down hill. Will go to the Monterey spot next time.</review><gmap_id>0x808e31f20c88bfdb:0xe78535c5dc22a4b9< /gmap_id>< rate>

<text>2nd time here, and 2nd time they messed up my phone order.  Called in for 2 medium pizzas, 1 cheese, half no cause, and 2nd Pepperoni and black olive.  They make one pizza, then when I point out problem they are slow to fix and still charged me for extra pizza with no effort to make things right.  Last time I will be at this location.</text>< pics>

Wow, just tried to order and have it delivered across the street (literally) and the man said they were unable to do so because the driver would get lost. Terrible customer service, they lost out on future business because of the lack of effort.<//Text>

I've been there a few times for the lunch buffet. It's ok. I wish they had more than 2 pizzas made at a time. I had to wait a little while once the pizzas were gone for new ones.<//Text>

I Love my Discovery Sport!  There was no feeling of pressure at JLRC, in fact the Manager welcomed me to the family.

I asked him about the recall and he said let me check im not sure but I will find out for you..... He did get us our answer he also informed us of the current specials going on and he was so helpful without ever being pushy that we left with a brand new Range Rover and he got the sale Thank you Don!< /Text>< pictures>

This review is not for the car it’s self, it is strictly for the “Packages” offered in financing. Be very aware of the terms of the packages. I purchased the break package and did not understand that it was only valid for 2 years. My breaks are still good after 2 years and do not need replacing so I have wasted the money.
As far as the car goes, there have been issues, possibly to many for a new car that cost over 100k but that is all forgotten when you drive it because this engine is a beast.< /Text>

Amazing guy and it shows with the staff he has in place. Eric Trevino is my advisor and again could not have a better person managing the relationship with the technicians that work on my vehicle, he's a 10! Lastly Jordan who makes sure the team gets me a courtesy car on time and the right size I could not say thank you enough. Great team out there at Carlsbad Land Rover Jaguar dealership...</review>< pictures>

I was shopping for a new vehicle and found it at Hoehn Jaguar.  I filled the information online and Tom called me right away.  We discussed what I needed to do.  We completed the transaction over the phone and email.  I picked up my new Jaguar e Pace the next day!   The customer service is amazing.< /text>

< review>
Service department communication is incredibly poor. I’ve dropped my 2019 vehicle off on two separate occasions in the past six months for two different issues plus a standard service. Both times three+ days passed with no updates and I’m chasing them for an update. This past time when I called a was told parts will be in in the morning and I would receive a call around lunch time with an update. Two days later and I’m calling them back again asking for an update since they didn’t call as promised. Really poor customer service compared to other dealer service shops I’ve used. Would recommend other dealer service.</review>

<text>Two things I will never do again:
1. Own a Jaguar
2. Buy a car from any Hoehn store

Beautiful car. Expensive and ugly ownership experience. I have never felt less valued as a customer than I did at Hoehn Jag, and I got rid of this car with less than 25k miles on it. I went to Hoehn Porsche to trade my F-Type in for a Carrera and was met with an equal amount of indifference there. Ended up buying a 9114S from San Diego Porsche. (I have never written a bad review online... about anything.)</text></record>

<text>On 8/9/20, my wife and I purchased a 2020 Land Rover Range Rover Sport HSE.
My wife and I were looking for a particular vehicle and Don was able to find us the exact one we wanted. It was late and the whole team stayed after (without rushing us) to complete the process. Dealerships are hard to deal with sometimes but for some reason Land Rover Carlsbad felt like immediate family. Don was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. He went above and beyond for us getting us the deal we wanted, did not rush us, and stayed over making sure we understood all the functions of the vehicle. I guess you would say some of this stuff is expected but we all know if you have ever purchased a vehicle it doesn’t always happen this way. This was a big purchase for my wife and I and we really were able to enjoy the experience. We met the General Manager Anthony who was appreciative of our purchase and congratulated us. We also dealt with Matt who worked in financing. He was extremely knowledgeable, presented us all our options, and was extremely funny.

Overall if your looking to purchase a Land Rover or a jaguar you HAVE to come here . The best team atmosphere coupled with the highest end of professionalism. I was extremely satisfied and pleased!</text>< Rating>

I leased my new Jaguar in November and the service provided by the team here has been wonderful ever since. I never have any issues making service appointments and they always offer a loner vehicle if I can’t wait.

I highly recommend this dealership and their service department.< /Review>

Don and Tom were great to deal with.  They were upfront friendly and fair.  We chatted mostly on the phone or via email and I only came in to sign documents and pay for the car. I told them I had to get it done in under and hour and they delivered.  I would definitely deal with these two gentlemen again. Thank you.</review>

I am so in love with my new Jag! Not only is the car amazing, but the salesmen, Tony was extremely helpful and very patient with me (I asked a lot of questions). Car shopping in the middle of a pandemic was not easy, but everyone at the dealership made it smooth and easy. Would highly recommend!</review>

Our service advisor, Miguel Rivera, did a great job keeping us informed on both our Jaguar and Land Rover: he had both at one time for various services. Tire prices were consistent with “box” stores, i.e. Discount and Costco. Appreciated that we could get everything done at the dealer rather than running from place to place for tires and an alignment, etc. Great job Miguel and the service drive guys for our loaner car! 👍🏼</Review>

I took my car in for a yearly inspection. This dealer then proactively filled my gas tank up, washed my car, and hand delivered the vehicle all the way back down to me in Point Loma. Now thats great service. And Im now a loyal customer. FYI - the other Land Rover dealership did not even want to help me and were being difficult which is only reason why I called Carlsbad. SERVICE MILLION TIMES better at this Land Rover dealership in Carlsbad. They are separate dealers, it matters, give this place your business!!<//Text>

<Text>Tony Moralez is the real deal. I was shopping for a range rover so I called "Jaguar Land Rover Carlsbad" and had the opportunity to talk to Tony Moralez.  From the minute he answered the phone, he was so helpful and knowledgeable by answering all my questions. He was so patient throughout the whole process, I felt no pressure at all. He was such an amazing Salesman.
I would highly recommended him to anybody interested in a Range Rover.  I can't thank you enough Tony Morales for being so helpful.
You're the best.

<Review>When deciding which so. Cal dealership to purchase my new Range Rover, I decided to look at the reviews for the corresponding service departments.  So I landed on Carlsbad Land Rover and special ordered my RR back in 2017.

I was originally assigned Eric Trevino as my service advisor. After 3 years of bringing my whip in for service and dealing with Eric every step of the way, I can honestly say I’m glad I purchased from Carlsbad.

These guys stand behind their service and will always do the right and fair thing. Very impressed with this operation and recommend to anyone looking to purchase a RR or Jaguar.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
By far the best Land Rover dealership in all of Southern California! This dealer is so great that I drove over an hour away just to work with them, and specifically Heath Friedman! Heath was an absolute dream to work with for several reasons I'll list below! For background, I approached over 8 dealerships in Southern California as I was looking for a car that had specific features and that was offered at an attractive price point. Every other dealership disregarded my entire email and what I was looking for and just sent a million emails and texts encouraging me to just come into the dealership despite my message saying that I lived far away and was checking for very specific information on their inventory and special offers before I made the drive out.. The only sales manager that was of any real help, was Heath at LR Carlsbad. He answered all my questions ahead of time and even addressed things I hadn't thought of beforehand - and I'm a big details and numbers person. Heath has a long experience working with Land Rover and is very knowledgeable about the history and features of the car, he was very genuine and always had my best interests in mind. He followed through on everything he said would and I'm so appreciative for all his help and support. I couldn't be happier with my new Evoque! Thank you Heath and LR Carlsbad!<//Review>

<review>We have had our 2015 RR Sport in for service to repair various components of the cooling system. The first two times were while under warranty. The car has a little over 50k miles and now it is in for the fourth time to get repairs to the cooling system. The dealer made no effort to acknowledge that this is the fourth time in for this problem and forced us to pay $2700 for the "needed repairs". This issue was discovered while still under warranty. The first time was around 30k miles. These guys are just parts changers and have done no real diagnosis as to what is causing all the failures. Very seriously considering contacting lemon law attorney. will never again buy anything from a Hoehn dealership. They blame manufacturer and make no effort to bat for their customers. This issue should be considered under warranty and Hoehn should have taken the lead in getting this done for us! Good thing there are plenty of other dealers out there!!!!!<//review>< Rate>

If you’re thinking about buying or leasing a car from HOEHN RANGE ROVER in Carlsbad, CA read  this:

This is the place you wanna go.  Recently I was notified that I could terminate my lease early. At first I had some concerns; "will they try to overbilled me", will I be charged for something after the fact", so not the case...(I also took really good care of the car and turned it in with no damage) So I called up ahead of time to schedule an appointment, they were very professional on the phone.  I was running a bit behind my appointment time, so he text me just to validated everything was ok. The day of my son was sick and drove all the way from AZ to turn in the car. I finally made it to the dealership. When I first walked in I told him I was thinking about buying a different brand car this was not a problem. Originally I was really wanting to lease another Range Rover, but they were more concerned about what I wanted (a full size SUV this time around) and what was best for me then Profiting from me. I told DON I was possibility interested in a discovery so they had one that I was on the edge about and again no pressure. He showed it to me made me a really good deal and then walked away to go take care of a second appointment, because by this time I had been Into someone's else's appointment time.  When I mention the other brand brand car I was interested in, Robert the finance guy stop what he was doing and drove me down to the other dealership so I can go check them out with no hesitations. At the other dealership they were just as professional. I guess Hohen dealerships train their employees a certain way(in a good way). We couldn’t find the car I was looking for, so he drove me back to Range Rover.
I have no future hesitations about going back to Range Rover for my next car.  You gentlemen are great, professional and everything that you wouldn’t expect from the car dealership. Thank you Robert and Don.<//Text>

Just because they send the “black guy” out to help you doesn’t mean you will be treated fairly. Tony, I take no pleasure in leaving this review because when you first approached me I was looking forward to my experience at JLR but you made it terrible. I was looking to purchase a new Evoque but was so disappointed with you lying about financing options that were clearly still available on the website, not offering to grab keys for me to look inside the vehicle and your overall attitude every time I asked a question. Tony, if you were sent to get rid of the young brown girl on the lot, you won but lost a sale. To say I was dissatisfied would be an understatement.< /Review><time>1594618176980<//time><pictures>None<//pictures><user>102967276018466776387< /user><Response>{'time': 1595023716332, 'text': 'Dear Guest,\n\nThank you for bringing your concerns to our attention.

<Review>Sell a car...thats your job.

Prospective customer: I see you guys are offering 0% financing.

Saleman: nahh that ended a while ago.

Prospective customer: So what are rates like now?

Salesman: 4% interest.

Prospective customers: okay...are there any incentives?

Salesman: No

How are you going to straight up lie to my face and then back peddle as soon as I mention Land Rover's website offer??

No offer to open the car. Didn't even ask for my name or offer a test drive.

If you don't want to sell a car, then go home.

If you want more details Land Rover or want to sell a car let me know.

Never bought a Land Rover and probably never will because of that horrible experience.<//Review>< rate>

I initially came for service when the dealership in San Diego closed unexpectedly last year. Now that it's back open, I will still make the long trek up to Carlsbad for service. Each time I have taken my car in, my Service Advisor, Eric Trevino, has been great. The professionalism and respect he shows has been top notch. I know that if I have any issues with my car, this dealership will do what they can to make it right. Thanks again!</Text>

The finest experience I’ve ever had buying a car.  Don Cross, our salesman, provided a no pressure, absolutely enjoyable experience.  Every person that we met in the store was friendly, super knowledgeable and first rate.  Mr. Hoehn even came out to greet us.  That was a great experience, too.  He’s funny, sincere and the kind of guy you’d like to have as a best friend.  Really.  You must experience it to believe it.  Believe me.  The entire experience was GREAT from start to finish.  They even gave me a great deal on a trade in.  I’m a customer for life.  As long as it’s a Hoehn dealership, I will buy all of my cars there.  I’ve bought a lot of cars in my life and have experienced all kinds of salesmen and dealers.  There is a huge difference from the rest of the auto market  at Hoehn.  The people are first rate and do what is right.  They’re simply the best.  They’ve got it going on there and you’ll be very happy to buy a car from them.  I think so and my friends that I’ve referred there think so, too.

Every time I go here ( once a year maybe) I come with optimism that perhaps I may have an exceptional customer service experience. Every time I come here the same sales man approaches me and attempts to make me feel uneducated , and wasteful of his time. He barks responses at me and speaks to me with a patronizing and condescending tone. Probably because I’m a black woman. I pull up with my
Mercedes E class , and I am treated no better then gum on the floor. A nuisance. Undeserving of anyone’s time or attention. I’m ignored. Could it be because of my skin color? Who knows... but that is the last time I will attempt a purchase at JLR Carlsbad. Go to Lexus instead... that’s what I did.<//Text>

<Text>Went in to pick up my car and it hadn’t been fixed but Don (the best sales person ever, I bought my car from him in August he was the least pushy car salesperson I have ever come across and we felt very comfortable with him). Don checked in on me several times. Jordan was very friendly and accommodating.  Travis was awesome he kept checking on me and he ended up keeping my car to get the issue taken care of. They have an amazing team at Hoehn Carlsbad.

< Review>
Purchased a 2017 Certified Land Rover Sport on March 10, 2020.  After  doing extensive research on the car, options and color that i wanted, I found the closest match online  Initially spoke with Kevin McCall over the phone for several days while traveling from Arizona.  Kevin was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and took his time to answer all my questions.  Kevin was understanding with an unexpected travel delay.  When I came in on March 9, negotiations including the value of my trade in took less than 30 minutes.  I believe that the negotiated price as well as the price given for my trade in was more than fair.  In addition, I was impressed with the quality of the vehicle given it had 20,000 miles.  I had to leave to pick up my son, came back the next day and the paperwork was done.   Kevin called the next day to make sure I had no questions.  With the COVID 19 crisis had to return to Arizona so there was some delays in finalizing the paperwork with everything being resolved on March 26, 2020.   I would highly recommend Kevin and Hoehn JLR<//Review>

< Review>
Just picked up a new e-pace I ordered a few months ago and I gotta say it was the best car buying experience I ever had. Mario in sales, John in finance, and the Robert the manager are basically the dream team of the buying process which has a stigma for being a pain in the arse. They were extremely friendly, weren't at all pushy, answered my 9 million questions, and went out of their way to make sure I got the deal that fit my goals. As long as Jaguar keeps building sexy beast of cars, Jaguar Land Rover Carlsbad will have my business for life! Maybe an i-pace next time once it has a few years to be polished up...<//Review>

I came in about a month ago for a regular maintenance. The staff was amazing and informative. My service fee turned out to be less than I expected and that was a wonderful surprise! Thank you, Land Rover! Great job< /text>

<review>I drove all the way from University City to Carlsbad because I was told the customer service was exceptional here at Hoehn.  They did not disappoint! I was treated extremely well by everyone from service to sales. I had all of my concerns addressed and taken care of especially the little details of the Jaguar app on my phone, all the way to the software inside of my car. Mark explained everything that was done and I was even given a brand new Range Rover to drive whole all of my services were completed over the weekend! Worth the drive.</review><user>101599550230338561830</user><user_name>Richard Hagstrom</user_name>< response>

If your looking to lease or buy a Jaguar or Land Rover go see Tom Wallace. Very customer service orientated. Will definitely buy from Tom again. Made it so painless.< /text>

< Review>
We originally came close to closing time, but Alan was super helpful and still let us take a test drive. He was willing to stay as late as needed to help answer any questions we had even though he had some place to be. Ultimately we decided to come back on the weekend. Alan was waiting for us when we got there and had the car we were interested in ready to go and immediately suggested we try out the specific car we wanted and take it for a test drive. When we got back, we negotiated with Alan, who was super fair and negotiated us a great deal without being overly pushy and listening to what we wanted rather than what the dealership wanted. He gave us all the different options so we could decide, though. Five star service, would buy from again. Ask for Alan, he’ll give you a fair deal.< /Review>

<review>Always wanted a Land Rover for the driving experience. I have to say as much as we enjoy our Range Rover Sport, we loved our buying and service experience at Hoehn. Easy buying experience and they know your name when you pull up to service!

No pressure, high knowledge of product, friendly staff, and right off the freeway. Worth a drive even from Orange County or South County.

We will continue to buy Land Rovers, and do it at Hoehn in Carlsbad. Highly recommend.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><name>Sean Stanfield</name>< Response>

<Review>Just bought a 2500 chevy 2016 from this place. And kevin and heath were awsome to deal with. I took my time looking it over and test driving it they were not aggresive and answered all my questions and if they dident have a answer they asked and got me the right answers cuz this being a land rover dealership they dident have experience in 2500 chevys but were still very knowledgeable.  It was r days later I decided to buy this truck and they drove it down to me, I live about 100 Miles form dealership and did all paperwork. So happy with my purchase and the way they do business there would refer them to anyone looking for car.  Thanks</Review><response>{'time': 1581440659136, 'text': 'Your review is greatly appreciated, Matthew! We hope you are enjoying your Chevy. -JLR Carlsbad'}< /response>< user>

<text>I feel I need to give a little bit of background in order to explain the gravitas of the work Tom and John at Land Rover Carlsbad put into making this deal happen.

I was raised by a car salesman, so let's say that my dad taught me a few things about how to close a deal, but more importantly, taught me the effort these professionals put into making someone's dream come true, and Tom and John were no exception.

A week ago I got my first car, and I got my dream car, that car you catch yourself seeing at every corner, and imagining yourself driving it, that's the car I got - A Range Rover EVOQUE!!

The process was long and extensive until I met Tom. I had been negotiating with dealerships all the way from Fresno to San Diego (I am local to Los Angeles), but from the moment I got on a call with Tom, he said two things that struck me, "I won't lose this deal, and I will make sure you will have the best experience." The hour had not passed before Tom had called me back with a deal that blew every single other dealership out of the water. It was such a crazy deal, that I asked my father (the car salesman) to drive up to Carlsbad for two things, to check if the deal was real or if they would change it up on me, and if it was to not lose it! When my dad got there 4 hours later (due to work), he called me to say that I needed to get there and sign the paperwork.  I am not kidding, what had taken me 3 months with other dealerships, took me exactly 24 hrs between picking up the phone and driving out with my new car.

Tom is simply the best salesman I have ever met, he is dedicated, trustworthy, and will bend over backward to get you what you are looking for. If you have ever thought about getting a car, especially a range rover, please trust me and go with him, NO ONE ELSE. You will never get a better deal or better customer service, he supported me and my family through this process.

You can check my profile, I normally don't write reviews, but this was too great of an experience for me to not say something.

I also have to give a shout out to John, from the financing team who, beyond being one of the funniest and most charismatic individuals I have ever met, made it possible with my very limited budget to get everything a young man needs on their first car. He made my monthly payment accessible, and included every perk and discount he could find, in order for me to drive out with that car. The conversations I had with John were beyond just the car and more about life and how to be. The deal, although it was the best in the State, was just a perk to who he was.

I conclude this review by saying that, my family and I left in tears, because as an immigrant family, to have their son's first car to be a Range Rover Evoque, encompasses a series of challenges we have overcome as a family to make it one step closer to the American dream.

I thank everyone at Range Rover Carlsbad for this opportunity, I won't ever forget the day I got my first car.</text>< Resp>

Looked for the best of the best and although coming from far I spoke to Tom who was the best, he was patient and efficient trough every step and gives the best service! Not only until the sale but even after he's there whenever i have questions and I completely recommend!! It's so hard to trust any dealer but here I felt so welcomed and am definitely going there for future cars! Thank you Tom :)</Text>

Their service department is booked out for weeks at any given time and always lacks loaner vehicles. For the price you pay for a Range Rover, you would and SHOULD expect better service. I also own a Ford Raptor... and the Ford service department is amazing. We've also owned an Acura MDX years ago... also an amazing service department and a BMW X5... also an amazing service department.

Range Rover corporate / HQ should step in and set this local dealership straight. Never buying a vehicle from this dealer again. They sell big league cars with minor league service.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Ordered mats online for Range Rover Sport. Paid for expedited shipping. Yet 3 days later have not shipped. Not good at returning emails or calls. "Manager off today", "person that handles online orders off today".  Very disappointed in this level if service.<//Text>

I've only had V6 and V8 vehicles. As soon as I drove off the lot on back roads and up steep hills I knew my F-Pace V4 was not quite as fluid or powerful as my V6. However using the DYNAMIC MODE when going up steep grades solved the problem. Its a gorgeous car and the systems are very intuitive. I will enjoy my beautiful V4 and look to get great mileage numbers this year.< /text>

On September 4, 2019 we purchased our very first Range Rover from Hoehn Jaguar Land Rover Carlsbad. We have been a customer of Hoehn Mercedes Benz for many years and this year we decided to switch to a Range Rover, might as well keep it with in the Hoehn Family. The dealership staff is super amazing and the buying experience is fabulous, top notch. outstanding, five star rated in my book. I would like to extend my many thanks to Rob, Mario, Tom, Bryce, Eric T,  and last but not least, Nancy, for their professionalism and great customer service. I highly recommend this car dealership if your interested in buying a Land Rover or a Jaguar, again thank you very much JLRC!</review>

Thomas was great to work with! I never look forward to buying a car for the stereotypical reasons, but Thomas was to the point, didn’t deviate from the price we could afford, and was efficient in getting us in and out, instead of trying to keep us there and upselling. Has passion for what he does which I could tell because it was the first person that has ever taken the time to walk me through and show me every option that comes with my car so I can enjoy it fully. I will definitely come back to him because he unlike most recognizes the big picture which is that if I like doing business with him I’ll keep giving him my business.</Text>

Over the phone he gave me a verbal quote of max $1,400 five days later the bill is over $2,000. I spoke with the GM a Hoehn family member who said "sorry that is to bad and I can not do anything about it." The service rep Eric and his boss  along with the GM are real dishonest people. Do not trust them.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Great experience! Salesperson Bryce Benfatti was the perfect fit for us - our previous car, Lexus IS 250, was totaled in an accident. No sales pitch - just test driving and math - worked through the credit, financing and warranties stress free.  We ended buying a 2017 Jaguar XE courtesy car, low mileage and great discount. Furthermore, after working through the numbers, we discovered our current car's loan payment was about the same as the lease - so we ended up leasing-to-own the other courtesy Jaguar XE. Nice cars! 100k warranties with Roadside assistance included. Overall a great experience with Bryce and the whole staff.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>There are only two authorized Land Rover Dealers in San Diego, both are equally terrible and take advantage of owners with the assumption that either they will just pay or they have no other choice.  It’s a minimum wait of 3-4 weeks to just get a service appointment with either San Diego Land Rover or Hoehn Land Rover.  Both dealers are understaffed, do not have enough technicians/mechanics and provide horrible customer service.

We recently had our vehicle at Hoehn Land Rover for service.  The front parking sensors were extremely sensitive and going off all the time.  Initially we were told that the front bumper had been impacted causing the camera and sensor to have shifted/moved.  Our vehicle has not been in a collision or accident, but Hoehn Land Rover says they can prove that our vehicle has hit something causing the damage.

I initially went to pickup our vehicle on a Monday, one week after it was dropped off for service.  My wife was initially told it would be ready to be picked up on Tuesday, however they vehicle was not done on time because the service advisor told my wife they do not have enough technicians to service the vehicles.  We could not pick up the vehicle on Friday, so I waited until the following Monday to pickup our vehicle.

On Monday, when inspecting the front camera and parking sensor, simply touching the camera caused it to detach and fall into the bumper area.  I immediately asked to speak with the service manager.  It was agreed that they would keep the vehicle longer, inspect the the vehicle and determine wether or not this would be a repairable item under warranty or and out-of-pocket expense.

We received an automated message at the end of the day Monday stating our vehicle was ready to be picked-up.  Great!!!  Now mind you, no one contacted us to confirm the damage or type of repairs made to our vehicle, nor did anyone ask for our final approval and/or authorization.

When I arrived Tuesday morning to pick-up our vehicle I was handed a bill and asked to pay.  Again, I immediately asked to speak to the Service Manager, after much discussion and arguing...the Service Manager agreed to absorb the cost of the stated repairs which they are claiming will not be covered under warranty because they can prove that our vehicle was in a collision or impact...

1).  They never obtained our final approval/authorization to make repairs.

2).  We were never informed upon inspection on Monday of the necessary repairs, no one called us to inform us of anything, tell us they were proceeding with making repairs...nothing!!!

3).  They appear to have made unnecessary repairs and attempted to charge us for repairs which may or may not work; and do not meet manufacturer standards.

Long story short...the repairs which Hoehn Land Rover attempted to make FAILED!!!  One of the parking sensors which was to have been either glued or zip-tied back into place was easily moved with the touch of a finger tip.  Hoehn Land Rover is now claiming that...and I quote, “has been repaired to the best of our ability” and “fit for purpose”.  They are now claiming that the real problem is the bumper and we need to replace our front bumper.  They refuse to stand behind their previous “claimed repairs” and have basically told us to go find another dealer to work with.  They will not honor their repair warranty, because we did not pay for their scam to glue and zip tie back the sensors.

So, in a nutshell we have a dealership who is fabricating stories, making unnecessary repairs and attempting to charge for unnecessary repairs; and when those repairs fail, creating a new story for another problem.  If that doesn’t smell like FRAUD and DECEPTION I don’t know what does...

I also find it amusing that the dealership takes the time to “thank” the positive reviews, but nothing to correct the negative complaints.  I guess they don’t want to acknowledge their mistakes and problems.< /Text>< GmapID>

Spoke with Jeff this morning. Not sure what department he is in as my call was transferred. Started off the call asking him how he was doing this morning. He was curt and cut me off before listening to my entire sentence. Seemed rushed, non interested. Although my question had a relatively easy answer, he should have let me explain in entirety, conveyed a sincere interest, provided me with an answer, and then asked if there was anything else I needed. He was very dismissive.

Also, Jeff should have began the call with a "good morning." Expected a much more professional experience from Land Rover.<//Review>

<Text>I had a problem with my alarm remote. Troy at service was fantastic. He put in a new battery at no charge for my 1999 Disco II. Superb customer service from the parts department. I would recommend LR Carlsbad to anyone who wants great service. Especially Troy McCutcheon from the parts department. Thank You Troy.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>I absolutely HATE this place, Do NOT bother going there, I have a Jaguar and a Range Rover.  I took my jag for service and a couple of repairs and when I picked up the car it was worse than when I brought it in because my car was not turning itself off, I took it back and they charge me another $505 after I paid $2600, an extra charge due to their incompetence.
Then I took my Range Rover,  left the car for 3 days kept calling spoke with Jeff ask him about my car and he said that my service advisor was going to call me, and nobody called me back, it seems that nobody there knows what's  going on, no team work, it seems that my car had disappeared. It is too sad that they are so bad in customer service and in  repairs too... Don't waste your time go somewhere else. Unfortunately one star is too much but Google doesn't let me give them zero stars.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Plenty of vehicles but the sales people don't really seem interested in selling. If you know what you want they are happy to sell it.  Otherwise, grab a brochure.</text>

Hmm... I ordered a part online.  They charged me for expedited shipping then took 7+ days to get the part to me.  I reached out several times, received lame excuses and was surprised no one took responsibility.  The online parts service fell well short of expectations for a JLR dealer.< /Text>

<username>David Temple< /username><review>THIS is what EVERY car-buying experience should look and feel like. I could stop there and you'd likely get the picture; however, there is so much more to say. First of all, if you're looking for a vehicle that is not only among the very finest made, but offers more safety factors than you can shake a nine iron at, the Land Rover lineup is the brand to shop. Secondly, the fit and finish on the Discovery Sport HSE is like a hand-tailored suit; it's smooth and refined, well-appointed, and offers the sort of head-turning attention it deserves. Thirdly, and I don't know about you, but better than 50% of my (and my wife's) pleasure of buying (or leasing) comes in the EXPERIENCE we get when shopping, dining, traveling, etc. And Jaguar-Land Rover Carlsbad is exactly the sort of experience you're looking for and expect from a Top Shelf dealership. Experience is Everything, and the team at JLRC make it happen in style. Lastly, and perhaps my favorite part of our recent experience, is Tom Wallace. Tom is the Business Manager & Sales Person who assisted us. I reached out to Tom weeks, if not months ago, when we first began our homework. He responded professionally, and without being pushy, letting me know in a confident way that he would be there for me when the right moment came. That moment came this past week. And by the weekend, we were driving away with a vehicle that, while I had dreamed of having such a vehicle, has exceeded my expectations in many ways. Yes, I have had a Rover in the past. In fact, I had a Range Rover Sport. Moreover, it quickly became my favorite. Personally, and as much I like the RR Sport, I believe this is a much better fit for me and my wife. The "Disco" is smaller, more fuel efficient--thanks to the lighter weight, and is equally luxurious (and for $10-20K less). Besides, the HSE has all the same bells & whistles and is much friendlier to the wallet (in gas consumption). But back to the best part of the experience: Tom Wallace. Tom is the consummate professional. His charming and helpful demeanor is simply outstanding. His attention to detail, knowledge of both the vehicles and the financing is superb. Finally, it's his warmth that makes you leave the lot feeling like you have a new friend--one that you can rest assured has Got Your Back. All that rambling said (you can't stop an enthusiastic writer from sharing), you owe it to yourself to (a) consider a ROVER for your next luxury purchase, (b) consider shopping Jaguar Land Rover Carlsbad (instead of nearby San Diego), and (c) consider asking for "our new friend" Tom Wallace. You will NOT be disappointed; I guarantee it. Cheers!<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1523474112598, 'text': 'Wow, Dave! Thank you for an incredible review.

BEWARE. DO NOT GO THERE. I called and spoke with service rep Eric and said the local brake store wants $1,200 so he said we can do it for that or maybe $1,400 four days later I pick up my Evoque and he has the nerve to give me a bill over $2,000  DO NOT GO THERE.</review>

<Review>Dishonest.   Land Rover Carlsbad provided me with a quote on a Rover sport lease and trade in for a 2014 sport on 10/5/16.  The quote was slightly better than another I had received at Land Rover Miramar.  I made an appointment  to go in and lease the car at Carlsbad.  After I arrived, and filled out all of the paperwork, I noticed that the Financial terms were different.  They tried to bury it in the numbers, but the reality was they were charging me 5 k more than what they showed on their written quote.  Be very careful to calculate total costs and review their math.  I walked out due to their dishonesty.  Went straight to Land Rover Miramar, and completed a lease and trade in of my other Range Rover in two hours with no funny business.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

We have been customers for many years. The Dr. has such a wonderful and calm demeanor, she also has the gentle hands which we all search for in a dentist. The staff is wonderful and they have new equipment in a very clean environment. It is important to note they placed TV sets on the ceilings with good channels like HGTV. The appointment sometimes feels like a spa visit in the relaxing chair. 🥰<//review>

Dr. Anu opened up a spot for an emergency appointment.  All the staff were nice and the entire office was impeccably clean.  There were very strict precautions to prevent contamination of Covid-19.  Dr. Any provided a thorough exam and helped relieve my pain.  Thank you to Brentwood Dental Center for taking me into dental emergency.  No pain, and much relief.  Thank you!</Review>

I am fortunate to find and meet with  Brentwood Dental Center. The whole staff is very cooperative and supportive. Dr. Annu is a very humble and more than perfect at her gig. We take my whole family for any dental treatments. We definitely want everyone to try their services.

<text>Dr. Anu is one of the finest dentist I have seen. She is professional in her work and this clinic is not like many others trying to mint you as much as they can in a short time from you or your insurance. Their advice is to the point and gives patients choice and never feel in any pressure to come for a follow up or for more treatment. Usually a dentist visit is stressful but not here. I feel relaxed and can trust this Doc.</text><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Costa is a wonderful person who truly cares about people & her patients dental health. She doesn't just assume you know what a procedure entails & tries to explain everything to you as she is going along. She's also not afraid to give with the Novacaine.
I am a difficult patient because I have many health issues, medications I take & strange allergies, almost all with severe reactions. Today I saw Her for an emergency visit after a 3 1/2 year hiatus in which I had been being seen at Western Dental in Antioch. She not only warmly welcomed me back with open arms & a waiting chair (She stayed late to be able to see me.) She didn't scold me for allowing my teeth to come to such a pass. She was just glad to have me back in her care & able to help. Even though my leaving previously had been a bit strained & many years had passed, she & the staff were warm, caring & asked about my family as if it has only been a few weeks instead of a few years! They even remembered my daughter's & my then newborn granddaughter's names! Also, though I'm fairly certain it's noted in the computer, they knew who my husband was & his dental issues even though we have different last names.
All this babbling to basically say, I think Dr. Costa is a kind, warm, caring, well educated Dentist who's genuinely concerned about not just you're dental health but your overall health & welfare, WITHOUT being nosy! A fantabulous combination that's hard to find... The Office Staff as well. Definitely gonna stay with her from now on!<//Review>

<Time>1488849602488</Time><rating>1<//rating><text>Dr. Arlene Cotas was a customer of mine. She owned another practice in Hayward as well as Brentwood. I serviced their equipment and sold them equipment and supplies. Dr. Cotas sold the hayward practice and just decided not to pay me the money she owes me. 9 thousand dollars is allot of money to me as I am a small business. I repeatedly tried to contact them by phone and email. I even drove to the brentwood office from the bay area. I also offered to waive ALL finance charges on her accounts if she paid her delinquent bills.  They refuse to speak to me. Arlene Cotas is a thief who refuses to pay her bills. I have small children and a wife to support.  My family had to move because we couldn't afford to pay our bills. What a horrible human being.< /text>< pics>

<review>Yesterday was the first time in this magnificent restaurant. But It is absolutely not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the attentive service, with the fine  cuisine and wine and with the modest charge. We will no doubt go back there soon.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>4 STAR. Overall. Would return but gotta make sure to specify no MSG otherwise it's just on par with other cantonese restaurants. Love the refillable complimentary free soup though. Not your average cheap free soup. My 7 year old had 2 bowls of that, paired with rice, and called it a meal. Generous portion at an average of $8 to $10 per plate to share. Ordered about one dish per person to share and still have plenty to take home.

Other: On the salty side in general. Some dishes are pre-MSG-ed. Avoid where makes sense. Fast service. Wouldn't be opposed to dine here if chosen by my group of friends. Just double emphasize the no MSG. Newly opened less than a month ago, doing well so far. Let’s hope they keep this up and not deteriorate in quality and portion as is the trend with new Chinese restaurants.</Review>< pics>

Good food. We ate the spicy salt pork chops which was amazing! The kung Pao shrimp was super good too. They have fast food available or you can sit down and order from the menu. Rated a 4 because no air conditioning.<//review>

Best Chinese food that I've had in a long time. We took our Pastors out to lunch. Let me just say that there was no left overs. Lot of food at a very reasonable price.<//Review>

This restaurant sucks, we ordered 8 dishes, they only give us 3 dishes in a hour with bad service.  If we hadn’t asked them to bring our food they would have never started to cook. WTF! Never ever going to this bad restaurant again! They also gave all the food to “Recent Comers” and “New Comers” are most likely to be ignored.</review>

This is a gem for authentic Cantonese food. The ingredients are the best and the chef knows how to cook many high end specialties not found on the menu. Friendly staff.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The characteristic of this restaurant is that it opens early, and you can go to work at 8 o'clock in the morning. In addition, you can buy a bento and eat lunch at the company in the afternoon, which is very convenient. 👍

(Original)
這家餐館的特點就是早開門，早上八點鐘就可以去吃個早餐再去上班。另外還可以買個便當，下午在公司吃便當，太方便了。👍< /text><date>1533496126635< /date></record>

The lamb, beef & chicken kabobs are juicy & seasoned perfectly. A gem of a restaurant in Turlock that you’d normally only see in the Bay Area.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Text>I had a wonderful experience here with my mom, and besides the food being wonderful, the staff were wonderful too. I had kashk-e badamjan, dolma, beef soltani, and zereshk polo. The dolma (a filling wrapped in grape leaves and stewed) were my mom's favorite and I loved the kashk-e badamjan (an eggplant dip made with dried, fried mint, fried onions, and topped with keshk, which is a salty fermented whey product, a Persian analog to yogurt). The beef soltani, which is tri-tip and koobideh (ground meat formed around a skewer and cooked) was very yummy and very generous. The chicken was perfectly cooked in the zereshk polo (a dish made with saffron and burberries - somewhat like a dried cranberry, sour and sweet) and very tender and juicy. .The service was on point as well. It was really soooo good. It's an awesome surprise to find such good Persian food in the valley!<//Text></record>

The BEST! Our family discovered this little slice of heaven about 6 months ago and we are hooked. This place is always fresh, flavorful and delicious. The ambiance is so relaxing and friendly and the service is always impeccable. The food tastes as if your persian mother cooked it herself. We eat here pretty much weekly now.<//Text>

Came as a pitstop gourmet lunch on the way to Fresno.
Atmosphere: casual and spotless environment, including clean restroom, outdoor seating available.
Food: delicious appetizers and according to my Persian relative the koobideh (chicken thigh) was marinated and cooked perfectly.

Thanks for everything<//Review></record>

Great food! We visited here traveling on a road trip looking for something fresh, tasty, and healthy. They didn't have any vegetarian entrees, but we were still able to build a veggie feast with appetizers and salads. The patio was nice to sit on as we were traveling with a dog. Excellent service! Definitely worth a visit!</text>

We are visiting from Merced, CA. The food is superb and delicious. It is just how the food is in Persia. I loved the food. About the staff, they are polite and welcoming, I felt very comfortable eating there. In overall, I had a great experience there and will visit this place again and again.< /review>

<Review>This is a hidden gem in Turlock. Clean. Prompt and kind service. Consistently good food from Iranian kitchen. I have been here several times and always feel it was a good value. Try the hummus appetizer. We love the beef and chicken skewers on rice.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I like to give for this restaurant 100 star but I can't, I have been passing from UC Merced with some co-worker to Modesto stop by Turlock for dinner and looking for Persian Restaurant, I pass few of them that show up in google map, end up Patogh Restaurant, outside flower design as a outdoor serving food is amazing to me, selection food are all homemade with top quality and very very happy with the price that I pay..they check every 10 minutes if we need something..that food test wonderful..

<rating>3</rating><Review>Family owned sit down middle eastern cuisine restaurant. The food here was decent, I ordered lamb kabob with rice and bread with yogurt cucumber dressing. The lamb was cooked perfectly with great flavor. I asked for a glass of red wine and apparently they have only one type of red or white wine because they didn't ask what kind of red and I saw no wine list. We were the only patrons at 6pm on a Saturday night. The decor lacks and is without ambience. The menu is overpriced for such a casual setting.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

We decided to try this restaurant on our way to Sacramento.  The food was great and the owner and the server were very friendly and helpful.  It seem this restaurant is under new management now.   Personally, I found their home made "Dough" amazing.  I would recommend this place.<//Review>

We have been coming to this restaurant for the past 20 years when  they had different owners under different names but since it became Patogh  the food and the service have changed for the best . Owners are very talented in Middle Eastern kitchen and they create tasty food.   We have tried many other places in California but we finally found the best food here at a very reasonable price . We recommend Patogh to everyone.</Review>< Pictures>

I tried both eggplant dishes-the jalepeno-tomato based one and the fried one with a creamy consistency , as well as the cucumber-tomato salad. A $3 serving of rice is a dinner sized plate-great place if you love leftovers! Happily satisfied and able to keep the meal gluten-free.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Simply amazing food and great service. We had the dolmas and eggplant for an appetizer. Phenomenally good. The lamb shank was to die for and the chicken beef combo platter was done to perfection.  The portions are quite large so bring your appetite!  I'm not in Turlock very often but next time I'm here I'm definitely bringing my family here!<//review>

It's under new ownership. They had a menu, but didnt carry most of the food on it. They had a nice tv screen with pictures of their dishes but like i said, didn't carry most of those food items. I'm going to say, they had recently opened up after have been shut down and remodeled a little from the sale of business. There is so much room for improvement. They need to take a look at restaurants who get 5 stars, why they get 5 stars. This business is family run and owned.</Review>

<Review>By far this is the best place to use for catering!! I’m amazed of how good their costomer service was and not to mention the mouth watering food that they provided! If your looking to spend money on good quality food that’s the place to come too! If I had the choice to put 10 stars I would have done so because they deserve it! THANK YOU PATOGH for the best service ever!!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>As a persian myself I can vouch for the extremely good quality of the food. The service is amazing and the people their are extremely nice. Paired with the fact that they make everything themselves. This resteraunt is quite outstanding.</Review><UserId.>118108852193201981279< /UserId.>< rating>

I do enjoy this place, but I also know it just switched owners so I am unclear on if it will still be good.  I hope it is and I will be going here again soon as I have done many times before.  Good Persian food.< /Review>

I always ordered food to go from this place. Last time chicken kabob was stale and smelled bad. I got diarrhea all night because of it. Never go there anymore.< /Text>

<Text>I was there on April 2017. There was only manager there. Food was cold. I asked for Barg Kabob and he brought me some pieces of grilled meat that does not have anything to do with Barg. They guy was trying to sell food and make money no matter what. The new owner took the place few months ago and the food was good for the first few weeks. Then the quality dropped so bad. I will never walk to that junk place anymore. Cold food,  fake food.< /Text><date>1495319442346<//date><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Gmap_id>0x8091071d7d673c43:0x586b2c11365970c1</Gmap_id><user>113543539573100706543< /user></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Needs more regrious supervision for what they serve.  It does cover the basics, however, the execution requires more indepth fundamental changes (babaghonoush). Chicken kabab were not cooked completely (needed 3 min of more charcoal heat), less-bread-koobideh is better.  This place has a potential of getting 5/5 after a slight improvement.< /Text><Rate>2</Rate><gmapID>0x8091071d7d673c43:0x586b2c11365970c1<//gmapID>< Date>

My favorite sushi place ever!! The tuna dish has a delicate sauce that makes my mouth water just thinking of it! The crab roll melts in your mouth with fresh tasty crab, slightly warm rice in the Japanese style, and the most delicate seaweed wrap. Scallop sushi with a hint of lemon is another delicate, classy dish. The service is real and charming. They're so welcoming when I arrive. We need this wonderful little oasis to continue forever! And parking is easier than you might think. If lot is full, plenty of street parking or try giant grocery lot across the street. Cant wait to go back!!<//Review>

For a corner sushi joint, a clear cut above the rest. Maybe two cuts. That said, while Hiko was previously top-tier among all of Los Angeles, competition has gotten stiffer. They're still excellent, but the very top is now higher.

That said, for global pandemic take-out... it's excellent. And the cooked rolls are among the best around!< /Text>

To give fair warning to anyone going in the first time: It's required to order a minimum of 4 items per person at a table and 5 per person if sitting at the bar. Sitting at the bar also means that the chef decides what you eat.

With that caveat out of the way the sushi was absolutely the best I've ever had. Many of the dishes had sauces put into them while being made and were recommended to be eaten without anything added to them. I followed that advice and didn't regret it for a moment.

The fish melted in the mouth and, even as a person who enjoys spicy foods but doesn't handle them well, the spicy sauce put into each item was superbly done and never caused me any problems. Each individual part was designed to perfectly compliment the main ingredient.

I do have to specifically mention that the eel was stunningly delectable and now heads my "best sushi item ever" list.

The staff was incredibly nice and unfailingly polite even though I came in a bare 30 minutes before they closed. The restaurant was small but delightfully proportioned to allow close seating without feeling crowded. The place seemed quite clean and well kept, the music selection was nice and provided excellent background to the idle talk, and the location makes it into a hidden gem nestled between other businesses.

I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to delight their palate and appreciate a small and quiet meal. I personally intend to make a more regular habit of visiting.< /text>

It's more like $$$. $6.00-$6.50 per order of basic sushi (two pieces) -- ended up being $160 for four people (includes on beer on one bottle of nigori) before tip.

The quality was superb, but they are definitely smaller size cuts of fish, so prepare to order more than you normally might.<//text>< pics>

Oof. Wanted to like this place. The portions are... Small. And not cheap. I'm a small lady, I got the minimum 4 piece order which ran about $30, definitely still hungry after. And the service, oh the service. So, so so slow. It wasn't even that busy. I don't think I'll be returning.</Text>

The fish markets are not open Saturday and Sunday. Neither is he. It could be his busiest days. That's a commitment to quality.
If you are a inconsiderate person,  this isn't the place for you. The owner is keenly aware of poor manners. He doesn't put up with rude behavior. Some of you might object. You're the people he's protective his core customers from.

I don't know why they are rated $..it's $$$
2 people $200 without trying.</text>

Just so your aware, I have very high standards when it comes to my sushi.  I was not impressed at all with the quality.  The sushi had a very fishy taste and was not served at the proper temperature. It was a bit warm. The rice was served hot.  Thats a big no no for serving sushi.  The only reason I gave two stars is because the server did not make a big deal about me returning the sushi.  Also, the cuts were thin.

I don't mind all the rules if the sushi is top notch.  I was hoping this place would work out since I live so close but that is not going to happen.  Not sure how they stayed in business this long.< /text>

lots of rules and restrictions. phones have to be turned off and put away. Everything on your plate has to be consumed before ordering more sushi. Two pieces of sushi comes out at a time. If you don't eat the rice, the chef is not happy. You most eat it all. The only waitress there and she is not friendly. The first thing that she said when we entered was, "have you been here before? we have strict rules here". No greeting. The positives: fish is fresh :)</Review>

The chef is ice stone cold like some reviewers have said, but you are there to eat some damn good sushi not make a new friend.

What to Expect:
- very quiet place
- chef takes no BS from anyone
- follow the rules, specially the cell phone one
- fish is as fresh as it can be
- definitely not a place to bring your kids
- 2 people 9-10 plates each will run you over $200

If you sit at the bar, I suggest have an open mind to what you are about to be served. This Chef is the Japanese version of Chef Ramsey, if he puts a plate in front of you, you better eat it.<//Text>< Pictures>

The food was excellent. First time trying albacore and it was absolutely delicious. And the toro handrolls were amazing. Only quibble is that this restaurant should definitely not be rated a single $ on price, probably more like $$$ (they have a 4 order minimum, and everything on the menu is between $6-$9; with drink, tax and tip it ends up coming out to about $40/person minimum).< /Text>

Fish is good. The female chef is OK. Sushi is good. However, the attitude of servers and chef are unfreindly and unpleasant. Very tired of so many rules for just eating sushi.  Understood no cell phone and no California rolls but limited two run orders etc are just too much. The server said sushi was art and should be respected. But the customer should get more respect too.  We just want to enjoy good sushi with nice service. I love sushi and have been many sushi restaurants in Japan, US, and everywhere. Very sorry that we had the most unpleasant sushi experience not because of quality of sushi but because of service and sushi art rurles.< /text>

First of all make sure you are truly ready for this visit.  Prepare by leaving your phone in your car for sure!  Do not be fooled, chef is old school and does not tolerate disruptions from beyond his establishment.  I wouldn't either if I was creating excellence and making dreams come true.   His chefs choice selection is ordered from the sushi bar and can be ordered from the few tables available.  But if you choose the bar a "thank you chef" or " I am full chef" is all to be said.  He doesn't need the engagement while creating perfection.  Chef Murata brings the craftsmanship of a true master to the quality of LA's freshest fish in a humble establishment maintained by his closest family.  Please be respectful, bring an appetite, and remember LEAVE THE PHONE IN YOUR CAR!  At the table you can order from the menu if you have specific taste, but he has never served anything less that Wow!  Sit back, enjoy, and take it in.  By no means a steal, but definitely a bargain compared to your LA, NYC, and Vegas options.  The freshness, quality, and skill for a modest price.  Don't expect to spend less than $50 unless you are portion controlling.  But I don't when I dine there.  I eat until "just one more" and I'm done :)<//Review>

Nothing short of mouthwatering - and, though pricey, not as expensive as some other top-notch sushi places.

No phones allowed while eating - save this place for date night!< /text>

<text>I have loved sushi from day one but never tasted sushi that destroyed the competition. Hiko Sushi has done just that! There is a reason this restaurant is Omakase style, its not just a fancy name to draw in customers, this chef is a true master. Each dish is prepared to perfection so don't worry about adding wasabi or soy sauce (unless he gives you the OK). Only the highest quality of fish is served and if it doesn't meet the chefs insanely high standards it won't be served.  Try this place, it will change your perspective on raw fish and how you rate your favorite sushi restaurant.<//text></record></dataset><record>

The sushi was excellent...best I have had in West Hollywood. The wasabi is even excellent! Sushi bar is strictly omakasi. Very fresh. Ikura was like in Japan! Yellowtail best ever. Really enjoyed visit! Small restaurant. Parking can be difficult but lot in back.<//Review>

<review>This place is unbelievable.  I really don't understand how someone could give this place more than 1 star.  First off, they have a lots of rules, rules, and rules ranging from min order, and other rules that I dont really have patience for.  What is so stupid is that the place was like a ghost town around 7 pm, and we were the only custmer and still they insist on educating us on their rules????  That is just plain Stupid!!! What is even more Stipid is the rediculus price. They increased the price by 50% and never bother to updaye the online menu price???? Are you kidding me???  Hey the owner, befor you worry about the others, you worry about your own responsibility FIRST.  We got out on a hurry!!!!!

<text>You guys are amazing! Not only were the flowers beautiful but the customer service is A+ . First experience sending flowers and it was so smooth! Thank you for making my sister feel very special on her birthday, she said they are beautiful and smell amazing!

I was not impressed with the arrangement that arrived to my great grandmothers. I ordered the deluxe version and it should have had some babies breath and more greenery and it had a lot of empty space in it like missing half the flowers.. I understand that it won't look exactly like the picture but this was horrible.  After the $30 delivery fee for $100 I am very disappointed wish I could post pictures.<//review>

Great flower shop definitely recommend and would order from them again. The entire experience was extremely easy and quick. They offered same day delivery and got it out within a very short time of placing the order. Additionally, the communication was great. I ordered online and received not only a confirmation email for the order but also an email when they started working on the order. I received a phone call once it was delivered which was very much appreciated. Often times when I order online from other places I am antsy and wondering what is going on with my order and an ETA but You and I flowers and gifts had such great communication I did not need to do all the extra work.

Most importantly, the bouquet they arranged was BEYOND gorgeous. I am extremely thankful for their work!<//Text>

Just want to thank them for making two flower arrangements kind of last minute for me. I live in Va and my family in CA(perris) and since I cannot be there in these hard sad times for our family with the loss of a family member they put two beautiful arrangements together and delivered them right to their door. Prices were great as well as service. I highly recommend them for any flower occasions. Thank you again Stephanie for helping me and being so kind❤</review>

I was shopping around for a good florist and I found this little gem. They made sure that my wife received her flowers before she left early for the day even though their schedule was tight. They were a gorgeous arrangement and very fair on pricing. Fernanda is a pleasure to do business with and went above and beyond for me. She demonstrated exemplary customer service and I will definitely be back!!!< /text>

I ordered online and provided my contact information. They cancelled and refunded my online order due lack of stock without contacting me for a replacement. I called several times over the weekend and their line sounded strange like someone was on the other end, but not speaking. I left a message several days ago but have not received a call back.</Text>

<review>I went early to have the oil changed in my vehicle before a long road trip. They opened on time and were efficient and quick to get me back on the road. The employees were very nice and professional. I'll definitely visit again when I need another oil change.< /review>< Rating>

Service was great. Only reason I did not give five star is because it took a long time to get car serviced, and they missed a tail light being out. Other than the wait and missing a tail light out.</review>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>Reasonable price, quick service, but I was charged $5 for removing the skid plate on the bottom of the car?  This isn't a difficult thing to do. I got charged for a dude having to use a power drill to remove like 12 screws??  Come on oil changers, this is a trivial thing, is it actually necessary to charge for removing screws?  I'm just glad they didn't charge me an "opening the hood fee", though it's really not that dissimilar.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3PgMiZyCc8jw8OHJLATdpf3PCmaMLIhblicyD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

I have been coming to oil changers for a few years now. But this experience was the best. David was servicing me today and he was very informative. Offered extra services(which I took). He was extremely friendly. Also let me know about their top off and tire air services. Thank you so much David. I will definately be coming back, as well as recommending your services.< /Text>

A bit of a wait today (about 20-30 mins) but I never have an issue because they always do a thorough and great job here, and that was done today. Even while waiting the service people always greet and guide everyone waiting as well, so I appreciate the heads up; luckily I wasn't in any kind of hurry today. Got my oil changed, fluids checked and replaced an air filter, staff advised me of services I might need to keep on file for later. All in all, my experiences at Oil Changers vs a larger shop/dealership for the same services are always high quality and much faster; not having to make an appointment is a massive plus. I will absolutely be back!<//text>

These guys got me in and out in 20-25 minutes. I was here on a weekday, so that probably helped, but I found the service efficient and friendly. They even clean your windshield! It was so nice not to have to drop off my car and come back.

Bonus: when I first came in at 5k miles, they told me not to bother with an oil change until 7k. They filled up my tires and checked my fluids for free, too!< /Text>

This place gives the best price on oil change prices. Not only that but the people that work there are so honest! I was about to 87 bucks to get a oil change because for leased 17 subaru BRZ and they told me the oil was full and still good. He further did research and told me that my oil is good up to 7000 miles and my dealership  makes me change it every 6000. So I saved my money and I will definitely come back when its passed the 1000 mark!<//review>

Amazing service! First time here and I got helped by Brad. He was awesome! He explained everything to me and didn't push added services like other places do. Will definitely make this my place for oil changes. Again shout out to Brad!< /Review>

<text>They used a product called  North American Multi power steering wheel that’s not compatible with the car that i drive. I made the mistake of not reading the manual of my car and seeing what kind of PSF is required on my specific car. Stay away or at least read your manual to make sure this oil change shop fluids are safe for your car. because obviously this shop doesn’t care. Wasted $75 bucks at this location just to get it flushed out and put the right fluid at the dealership!!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

AMAZING SERVICE!!! Every single time. My wife and I have been coming here for years because we used to live close by. We still come here now that we have moved further away. Christina and her team are exactly what you want out of a neighborhood auto shop. Oil changes are fast, and they go way above and beyond. So happy and will come here for as long as we live in San Diego.<//Review>

I wanted to change the oil in my college daughter’s car, which is very infrequently used. When I pulled in I told the tech I wasn’t sure how many miles it had been since I don’t use the car (mostly nobody does). He checked the oil and then his records. Said it had been 600 miles. He could change the oil but it looked great, was full and visually clean. He said he wouldn’t change it on his car. He topped off fluids, put air in tires and I was on my way no charge. I’ve been to this place at least a dozen times with three cars. Kristina is clearly an excellent manager and their techs are honest and good at their jobs. What a great place!!!< /Review>

A day after having my oil changed, my a/c began leaking water into my car. I went to a mechanic who said someone had left a rag that was blocking my a/c drain. The rag was from oil changers but they refused to pay for the cost to see the mechanic. They were very unprofessional about it and lied about the rag not being theirs, when it absolutely was. I physically compared their rags. They are the only people who have touched my car in 6 months +</Text>

<review>Amazing, no hassle, straight to the point service. They tell you like it is, whether your car is good or if it needs something. The first thing they told me as I was pulling up was the price. For my Honda CR-Z EX 2014, full synthetic was around $80 with tax. Kristina runs a tight ship. She showed me my air filter, which was dirty but they cleaned it, then she told me about my transmission fluid. She didn’t pressure me into anything but instead informed me about it, quoted it, then asked if I wanted to do the transmission fluid. All in all, this is one of the best places to get your oil change. And they are fast and efficient. Will get my oil changes here from now on.

Easily the most expensive oil change I've ever had, and you don't find out the price till waiting in a gridlock of cars that you can't get out of (in my case close to an hour.) Once you're in line and someone else comes behind you, you're stuck. I ended up paying $70+ for an oil change. My last oil change in the same neighborhood was $30. One time I was hanging out with my friend and they started telling me a story similar to mine, turns out this place is known for this. That laugh was almost worth the extra $40+, but not quite.<//review>

<text>I have always had an amazing experience at this location. Kristina and her crew are incredible and have always taken such good care of my 97’ 4Runner. she’s getting old and I want her to run forever so I’m very picky about who I trust to taken care of her. They give military discount and are super fast and efficient. They always give her a look over to make sure there’s nothing else they see that needs attention and I always leave happy.

Very nice and honest people. Went there to get an oil change but they told me I still have enough oil, so they just checked my car for free and I went on my way.
I always come here, premium oil change is cheap and service is fast.</text>

We were on vacation here and stopped by these guys for an oil change! These guys were awesome! They informed us we didn't actually need an oil change yet, based on the type of oil we had. It was so nice for them to take a few seconds to teach us so that we could make more informed decisions in the future. They were very professional and even topped us off, including checking our tires. Really appreciated the honesty and professionalism here. Absolutely recommend!!!<//review>

Repeatedly fantastic service for an oil change, at what I think is a reasonable price. Short wait times, friendly technicians and good location.

Two bays available, best time to go is just after lunch in my opinion.</text>

Came in before my car needed an oil change and David let me know it wasn't necessary yet. Checked all my fluids and tire pressure and everything. Filled my tires up and I'm ready for my road trip. Will definitely be back in 1,000 miles to get my oil change. Hard to find honest people in this business and they have definitely earned my trust today!<//review>

I've come here for years with multiple vehicles. Today however was a first on bad service. I was notified my air filter needed to be replaced and usually I have them do any recommended work but lucky today I said I'd do my own filter. I left and went to O'Reilly auto parts to grab the filter. I left my hood and they left an oily rag on my engine block. This tag was smoking when I got up the street. Glad I opted out of a service for once or my car would be on fire beside the highway right now.< /Review>

Came here a few months back with my best friend to get her oil changed. We were helped by a woman named Christina, she was not only super friendly she was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I came back today in my own car and got the same experience. The whole staff was great and so fluid. They all seemed to work together so well and give off a great positive energy you don't usually find at any type of mechanic shop. Thank you so much for all your help and  a special thanks to Christina for the info, advice and experience.<//text>

I have been going to this place for years and I love it. The staff is always super friendly, and they provide excellent customer service. I definitely recommend getting those "pre-loaded" cards too - 4 oil changes for $136 (and of course, per each visit, you get more than just an oil change - tire pressure check, cleaned windows, fluids topped off, etc). Would recommend!< /review>

I use many of the oil changers properties, they are always thorough, fast, and friendly. I take all of my cars here. U can buy 3 oil changes and get 1 free. Now take your bunions over there and see why I love this place!!! 🤙🏽🤙🏽😁<//Review>

<Review>Kristina and her team were timely and efficient with my oil change, and they topped off all fluids and tires and had me out in about 25 minutes. They were in no way pushy about adding on extras, just provided clarity as to what the purpose of the filters were and why you replace them, but my lease term is up in less than a month so I passed. I will be back in the future for additianal maintenance work.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Kristina just might be my woman crush this Wednesday. She was absolutely knowledgeable, was thorough with explanations and was exuding confidence. It's so refreshing and empowering to see a female in charge in a male dominated workforce. But the dream team wouldn't be complete without Jerry and David. They all worked together very cohesively and had great communication dynamic. They all actually seemed to care about their job - because of that, I had great respect for this shop. As for the services, the prices were a lot more reasonable than the other local businesses as well as the larger chains that I called. Bonus is that they were open on a Sunday. No appt necessary, first come first serve. The process didn't take long and I DID NOT feel pressured to buy any other services (what a shocker). They check lights and air in tires. Was informed of their "Free top off policy," which makes makes me feel reassured of their services. Favorited this location on my Maps list and will definitely be back again. Thanks team!< /review><response>{'time': 1547659901663, 'text': 'Thank you Akiko. We look forward to seeing you again!'}</response><pics>None<//pics></record>

I came to get an oil change here because it had been about 4k miles since I'd had one. I keep my car running pretty clean with the highest grade of fuel and regular system flushes with additives. They said I didn't need one because my oil was still light, and gave me a sticker to come back in a couple of thousand more miles. I came back then, and they said I still wasn't hurting for an oil change, but I decided to get one anyway. Prompt service, honest staff, and they checked my other fluids and topped off my tire pressure too. Great service!<//Text>

Went to Oul changers yet again, and was NOT disappointed. I go here over the dealership for the obvious reasons but other than that I come here for the superb service. I don’t drive a really expensive car so I don’t trust many places because of that fact alone that I don’t drive an expensive car and can’t afford a bad job done on it lol but I trust this place big time. Thanks so much for the consistency of high quality service. Kudos to the whole team especially Kristina!! Cheers!<//review>

Very quick service. You stay in your car, they service the vehicle in ten minutes and you roll out and youre on your way. Typically this would talk at least a half hour for a simple oil change.

I Bought a Vehicle off one of my coworkers and took it here to get an oil change today and they checked it and My coworker Must have had it done before he sold it to me. Oil changers could have changed my oil anyway and I would have never known but Instead he told me that it didn’t need it and that they didn’t want to Charge me for something I didn’t need.
They will Definitely be getting all my future work.
Really honest and no wait when I was there.</Text>

I went here while on vacation from Arizona.  I had just done an oil change but yesterday my car was acting strange and for a minute said “low oil pressure”.  I thought maybe there was some junk in the oil filter.  I went to Oil Changers and not only did they say I didn’t need an oil change, they removed and let me look at the filter (no clog) they reinstalled the filter, topped off my oil, made other suggestions....then they didn’t even charge me!!! This place is a hidden gem.  I will definitely use them again when in the area.<//text>

These guys are great. Intelligent, respectful, fast. I drove up, they asked me a few questions about the oil I use, and got straight to work. They checked all my liquids, washed my windshield, and threw in some entertaining banter to boot. Great experience, definitely going back.</Text>

Really nice and honest guys. They told me that I didn’t need an oil change and actually showed me how oil looks when it needs to be changed. So I wasn’t charged a dime and they checked my tire pressure and quickly checked all the basic stuff. I will definitely go back when I actually need an oil change haha</Review>

The great thing about this oil change places you get to sit in your car while your oil changed. No sitting outside in the sun or having to wait and dingy waiting rooms. Only negative thing is that they seem to be super busy most days. The slowest days I've seen or Mondays and Tuesdays about 10 a.m.<//text>

Best oil change I didn’t get. Let me explain: went in for an oil change and Kristina, the person helping me, explained that instead of getting an oil change, I should go put the money toward fixing the oil leak I didn’t know I had. Instead of trying to sell me an oil change I didn’t necessarily need, she topped off all my fluids and printed out what work she recommend I have done before coming back. Didn’t charge me a cent. Seriously 5/5 stars, I’m coming back here for every oil change I get from now until the end of time lol< /review>

< Review>
I had a wonderful experience at this shop last week--I went in for a routine oil change and the gentleman who helped me was friendly, fast, and even helped answer some of my miscellaneous car questions while he worked. I cannot thank these guys enough for a painless and--dare I say enjoyable--experience while I knocked something off of my To Do list.</Review>

Also I noticed Valvoline told me my car required a special oil with dextrose and charged me extra. The price difference was significant. There was a female working the day I went and I typically feel a noticeable vibe that’s less aggressive and tribal then when it’s all males. They showed me the dipstick after they were done. I was gonna ask to to see it as I’ve watched too many videos of oil change scamers. If you want an honest relaxed encounter with the best value, go to this place I’ve made it my oil change home.

<Review>Cost me $77 for a full synthetic oil change, which would have cost $88 at jiffy lube. It's a great place because you don't have to get out of your car. It took 15 minutes. And you KNOW that they actually changed your oil. Some car places scam you and don't actually change everything. They also fill your tires, clean your windshield.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1531171892858, 'text': "Thank You Izzy Young, we appreciate you sharing with us on Google! Oil Changers San Diego's 2018 Pricing for Regular Oil Change by request is 47.99+tax, for Synthetic Oil it is 77.99+tax. We have a couple options that can be requested, we normally use our North American Lubricants Synthetic Oil which is standard but you can also request Mobil1 or Chevron Brand (which is addional). Our NAL Synthetic Blend is the comparable to all the other brands, and is already factored into the standard estimate and pricing. All pricing is an estimate because we would have to do a vehicle look up for Manufacture Specifications and Guidelines based on Vehicle Year, Make, Model and Engine Size.

<Time>1477250967349<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>We stopped by to get an oil change and weren't able to get one due to Mini's design placing the oil filter under another part that has to be removed first. Sounds like a complaint but I assure you this is quite the opposite. The gal helping us, Kristina, was extremely knowledgeable and explained exactly why she couldn't service the vehicle. She then gave us a few recommendations for places that work on Minis. We've had nothing but problems going to the Mini dealership and Kristina's fast and very helpful expertise helped us more than all previous Mini dealership visits. There have been five in the past year from having constant problems, oil consumption being a big one. Her colleague, Ryan, was also extremely helpful and gave great advice. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. When we get rid of this Mini for a better car, we're only going to Oil Changers.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1478119101893, 'text': 'Brittany thank you for the 5 Star post!'}< /resp>< GmapID>

I am a car guy and I know how easy it is to change oil, but due to living in an apartment I don't have the space or means to do so. This place is literally the most convinient oil change spot I have ever been to! The people that work here are so nice and inform you of what they are doing each step of the way. I always like to get my oil changed a bit sooner than factory recommended and the workers here always tell me that the oil looks good and doesnt need to be changed becuase it could go a few more thousand miles and this shows just how honest they are! As long as I live in the area, I will continue to go to here!</Text>

Reasonable price with $5 discount for checking in on Yelp. The guy who was taking care of my car was very distracted by a telephone call he received and then the person who called came there and it got worse. He didn't even ask me how much air I wanted in my tires, when I had heard the other guy ask two other customers. I did like that you can stay in your car, since I am disabled.< /review>

<Text>Professionals with good business practices who know cars. I came in for an oil change ('cause my car's nav system told me it was time for one), was helped within 10 minutes and was told I didn't need a change for another 1500 miles or so. They did a quick check and topped my wiper fluid and filled my tires for free. Will definitely be coming back.

The entrance was a little weird (typical for North Park). If you haven't been there before -just wait in line in your car and you'll be directed in as they free up.<//Text></record>

<Review>Don't bother coming here after work. The techs took an hour per car, mostly because they were chatting with each other and the customers. I wouldn't mind so much if they didn't spend 45 minutes assuring me that they would get to me and the car next to me. Especially since I was there an hour and a half before close and confirmed before stopping that they would have time for me. Probly fine if you have the day off or lots of time to spare, but I just don't have time to be lied to by people with poor time management skills.

One last thing, the more talkative tech that was the reassuring one wasn't clocked in so if a mistake happens that he did it would have been on the guy whose profile he was using
Great accountability.

Although maybe I just came on the wrong day, they were friendly which is good to find.

Edit 1:
Pretty impressive to get a response from the owner within 1 day. Perhaps I'll try them again on a day off when I'm not after work crabby. Also moving you up to 3 star for the Inquiry, will update and possibly email after the return visit.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1459439177418, 'text': 'Justin,\n\nWe apologize for poor service you received and would like to get to the bottom of your visit.

<user>114290421574794400148< /user><name>Jonny Kent< /name><Date>1509228362756</Date><Rate>4<//Rate><review>We came in today when it was quiet and asked for an oil change and were quoted $35  for the first 5 quarts and extra $3 per quart if it was over that. Asked if that included a filter and was told yes it was included in the price. Said ok. After it was done they wanted $49 without presenting any invoice. Gave them my credit card and then had to move our vehicle out some so another vehicle could get in as it had gotten busy . Then a pin was needed for the credit card. Once paid, an invoice was presented. Since they were rushing me out at this stage as things had gotten busy I drove around the corner and parked before looking at the bill more closely. I saw they had charged $43.99 for a 'full service' when all I asked for was an oil change. I went back and asked why they had charged that much when they had quoted $35 and two of the staff immediately said back to me that they had quoted $45. I did not wish to argue even though both myself and my passenger had clearly heard the $35 quote. I left.
On the good side I give them 4 stars for reasonably quick service and the courteous staff except when I questioned the end cost. The assertion that they had quoted $45 is nonsensical given the breakdown on the bill :$43.99 for a 'full' service, $3 for an extra quart plus $2.01 tax. No $45 in there anywhere. I think they just unsold me a full service when I had asked for only an oil change.
Guess this will have been the last visit. Sad as otherwise a good experience.
BTW  for the record they did try to upsell for  other services but it wasn't pushy just an offer.</review>< Pics>

I tried this place for the first time today and I have to say that I was impressed with the service. I used to work in the lube side of a dealership and I went to school for automotive so I know what I’m doing when I go to these kinds of places (not the dealer) for 4$ more than the dealer I have to say it was worth it just because of the convenience. There may not be a tire rotation included but you still get the tires inflated, still get all the fluids checked and you’re not waiting for someone to give you your keys back, you’re already in your car. Prices for different services are competitive as well and not outrageous, if I need an oil change quickly I will definitely come back here just to get me through to my next oil change interval if I can’t get one with a dealer. By the way, when they’re trying to “upsell” you, try to be more open minded, it’s not an upsell, if you don’t maintain other things in your besides the engine oil there will be bigger issues in the future, these guys are only bringing things to your attention that you actually need or should give more attention to, even if you don’t get the services done by them. I like these guys because they’re up front, call out what they’re doing and friendly.< /text>

An oil change while you wait in your car! They check tire pressure, signal lights and even cleaned my windshield.

The employees are fast, efficient and knowledgeable!

Even if they recommend it, never have an engine decarbonization done!<//review>

Fast and efficient no nonsense brought my own filter (you have this option here, most places make you use their oil and filter) and oil and sat in the car as they did the change in 22 minutes beats jiffy lube any day and costs less.<//review>

I came in for a routine oil change, because I trusted these good reviews. However, they tried to charge me $160 (!!!!). They tried to cram in every possible service they could, to get as much money as possible, and they argued with me when I said I just wanted an oil change. For instance, they tried to change my power steering fluid, something that _never_ needs changing, except in extreme situations. So, unless you're looking for an overpriced oil change, deception, and high pressure sales, avoid this establishment.< /review>

<review>Alfonso was amazing!  The customer service is fantastic! I was in and out in no time. They even told me that they do free top off service as long as it's under 3000 miles.  Sweeeet! I'm sooooooo happy with the service! :-D

Thanks Alfonso! I'll be back!< /review>< Pictures>

Very bad experience and Horrible Customer Service

First off, I did not mind waiting 55 minutes to be serviced for an oil change. However, I was on a conference call for my work meanwhile while waiting to make the most out of my time. Once they were ready for me, as I try to hang up the call, the mechanics/workers begin yelling at me and lecturing me. They can’t wait 60 seconds for me to hang up a call, but I can wait 55 minutes to be serviced. I didn’t say anything and hung up the phone, yet the verbal abuse still continued not only directed to me, but also amongst each other about me. Not a pleasant experience.

Safety issue and bad customer service

I noticed they began working on my tires without mentioning they would do so. I then mentioned to them that my tires are never worked on here because they are Nitrogen tires. I mentioned that to the lady mechanic working there, she barked back at me saying “THESE ARE NOT NITROGEN TIRES..NITROGEN TIRES HAVE A GREEN LABEL…” this and the other….Mind you, this car is my car, it has nitrogen tires and the silver caps on them came from the dealership Raceway Nissan. Not all Nitrogen tires have green labels and if a customer says they have nitrogen tires then please don’t continue putting air into them. Have some respect and don’t argue with the customer while at the same time setting yourself up for a major safety hazard out of pure ignorance.

Lastly, not tech savvy and also bad customer service.

When it came time to pay, I wanted to go to the credit card machine to pay with my virtual card using Samsung pay. The lady mechanic wouldn’t let me pay saying that it won’t work. She then wanted me to explain how Samsung pay works because she wasn’t knowledgeable in that. She refused to take my method of payment until I insisted on it. While I was making the payment she was complaining. What do you know? Payment went through. And, the payment would have gone through just fine without all the none-sense; It’s a normal credit card payment as far as ATM/credit card machines go and is both secure and seamless.

Also,

I looked at my history, since my last 3 oil changes were performed here, and it stated Nitrogen for my tires each time. So, why the argument now? Why the bad customer service? Why the back talk and bad judgment?

Never again will I come here or recommend this place to anyone.</review>

How to kill an otherwise usual great experience with Oil Changer. Pull up at 1:52 P.M. new years eve (they close @ 2 as i was told by her) woman comes out, great fake smile appreciated then ensues "we close at 2, i can't tell you to leave since im not technically closed but if you arent in my shop by 2 im going to close these doors no matter what." Ah, the hourly employee who doesn't give two **** about the customer experience. Congratulations! telling a customer that might be waiting 8 minutes that your going to slam the door in his face if you dont work fast enough instead of just politely asking me to leave because your about to close.

Been a pleasure going to you guys for the past 4 years, that ends today.</text>

<Review>Went in for an oil change after driving 6k miles and my car "check engine" light came on. Was given attitude by this grumpy white guy that was mad at the world. They told me that I did not need an oil change and sent me on my way.  Went to Jiffy Lube right after on B st and guess what? I needed an oil change. Definately walked away feeling discriminated for being gay.  These guys may secretely want a man deep inside them that they act all homophobic!  Do not go to this place!<//Review>< resp>

Such a warm, beautiful and inviting restaurant from the design, to the staff. The food is incredible, some of the absolute best in the area. If you are dining for takeout, they give you perfect instructions for reheating at home.</text>

<time>1552888471349<//time><rating>5< /rating><text>I have been here several times and never a single time I was let down. I usually order the 3 course menu ($60) including appetizer, pasta, and an entree. Yes the portion is smaller than a la carte, but neither my partner nor I felt we needed to order more. The Chef is also good at making soup. It’s so good I was seriously considering order a regular bowl.

Wine by glass is quite pricey, usually between $12-15/glass. We decided to go with a bottle that fits within the budget we are more comfortable with.

It’s a family owned restaurant so maybe that’s why it feels even more homier.  The paintings on the walls were painted by the mother of the chef.  It does get busy on the weekends. It’ll make the whole dining experience even better if they can reduce the number of tables in the restaurant. Our table was really close to other tables it reminded me of my dining experience in Paris.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcSQrzJcCHoDezDqK-SEDRhAxtmETUnzEduws1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

Cute little venue serving adventurous if not wholly successful dishes.  Best of the night: Mixed berry pavlova was a wondrous dish with the best meringue I've ever had.  Worst: pesto fettuccine with chicken meatballs had dry meat and flavorless sauce... Solid concept, but executed disappointingly.  Most interesting: parmesan custard and pea budino was a delightfully delicate adventure of mild, summery flavors and creamy textures.<//Text>

My parents eat at Persephone often and love it. They took me Sunday and I’m a huge fan now! The food is so fresh, organic, of the highest quality and prepared so well. Also the service is incredible.<//review>

I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. Go. Enjoy great food from dedicated workers, and support a local business. You won't regret it.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

We ordered soup to start, he the sausage lentil and I the butternut squash.  Both soups were delicious. He had the fresh albacore tuna entree and loved it.  I had a homeade pasta dish that was very yummy.  Homemade bread served with dinner too.  The service was excellent.  Great place to celebrate a special occasion. This is a family run business. Definitely a keeper.<//text>< name>

Got right in at 7:30 with no reservation on Wednesday.   Great wine crisp white and not to fruity just right it was from Portugal. The food was worth the wait I had the Chicken dish crusty on the outside moist on the inside.  And the serving sizes were perfect.   Great job< /text>

Painfully disappointing. Waitstaff started out friendly and nice then things went south. Orders were mixed up, delay in service. Lack of acknowledgment about mistakes. This is a reflection on the managements style or lack of. We wanted a fine dining experience but it didn't happen. We hope this helps because we want you to succeed.</Text>

Delicious, original cuisine served here. A cozy little restaurant, with an amazing, professional staff. Some complain at the prices, but for sustainable, organic as you can get in Aptos , hand made food by experienced chefs you should expect this much quality in SF. Be happy you saved 4 hours round trip in gas. Excellent wine selection. It's a great place to take someone you love.< /text>

Had yet another fabulous dinner at Persephone! Everything on the menu looked wonderful, but the Beet and Apple Budino appetizer was out of this world, as was the Honey Dijon glazed Albacore. I highly recommend those! My friend had a great Butternut Squash soup and the Pomegranate glazed chicken which was also outstanding.
That, and the fact that the restaurant's design is stunning, make Persephone my all time favorite! Run, don't walk!<//Text>

It's a small venue that seats maybe 30, so reservations are suggested. We went to a winemakers dinner and each course was paired very well with the wines.<//review>< Pictures>

Service and food was great! I was surprised at how reasonable and comfortable it was. Not a “froofy” fine dining place, fits well into aptos. Extensive and affordable local wine list. Will come back!<//Text>

Food is decent. Service is ok. But I expected a lot more than 4 raviolis when in cost me 28 bucks. There's a lot of potential here but it was honestly disappointing overall.</review>

I had one of the best meals and dining experiences at Persephone last night! It is one of those newer gems Santa Cruz is fortunate enough to have open up. I think this place will be around for the long haul. They have all the important pieces in place: a gifted visionary chef, great menu with local and sustainable ingredients, well trained wait staff, fabulous management, beautiful decor and ambiance, good volume levels, and a desire to continue to grow and evolve to make things better and better (even while they're clearly already doing an amazing job)! I am delighted to have finally made it I'm for a memorable meal. I look forward to returning again soon and becoming better acquainted with the owners and staff and their changing menu. Don't wait, call and make your reservation now!< /review>

Delicious food, with a very pleasing aesthetic.

Update 4/5/18:
On second visit the dinner was fairly bland. The menu was ambitious, but the dishes lacked flavor. I had a chicken stuffed with feta and sun-dried tomato, and my girlfriend had a beef pasta, both seemed like they were salt deficient and the pasta was overcooked.

Our appetizers were also fairly ambitious, hers was a bitter greens salad with prosciutto and a duck egg in which the flavors didn't quite mix. Mine was a mandarin and fennel salad that had good flavor but was very limp.

The wine selection was great, and the cider was quite delicious.

We did not have any desserts because they were out of the panna cotta at 7pm. The other desserts looked like they could be good, but just weren't appealing to us.

Overall, it was quite a let down tonight after being so great the first time as went in. However, the aesthetic is still nice and the sourdough focaccia they served upon seating us was delicious.< /text>

<text>One side of the park a lady came and kicked me out of the grass for the kids so the school next door can use it. Kids are awesome so me and my dog went to the other side of the park no problems. Unfortunately a not so conscious dog owner let her dog run free directly up to mine which happens to be a coyote hybrid, thankfully my dog and well-mannered enough she didn't eat that dog. Not very smart or neighborly< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Small neighborhood park in the heart of Normal Heights/Kensington. Love to bring my dog here for socializing and also very nice quiet and clean park to just hang out and walk around.

The gated in soccer field is used by dog owners to play fetch with their dogs or just let them run around and socialize with other doggos.

Park has restroom facilities and tables for picnics and open spaces for picnics and kiddos to run around.<//review>

Great park! Beautiful views and a great dog park! Some one said the large dog park was over grown until recently so that's good!! Next time we'll let our pup play with the big dogs! 😊<//text>

Nice little park. Has two playgrounds one for tots and big kids. The few times I’ve been here is clean. I like that it has a lot of benches near playground.</Review>

We're so lucky to have this neighborhood resource. A nice walking path goes all the way around the park, playground for the kiddos, picnic benches, basketball court, it's just a nice place to hang out.< /Text>

This is my neighborhood park. Been here 15 years Park used to be a lot cleaner unfortunately a lot of homeless live and camp out here. It's a great place to take your dog for a walk do a run good little workout or watch a movie at the amphitheater during the summer.< /text>

Great little hidden park. Pretty awesome parallel bar set up along with pull up bars. Get a work out in while the kids play at the park (large play structure and sandbox).< /text>

<review>My local park. I walk here and through here a few times a week. Nothing to special, just a nice little park. Way less homeless people and trash here than other parks in the area (like north park). Always people playing basketball, parents bring there kids to the playground area often, people laying on blankets reading books, walking there dogs. There's a off leash dog section, but its kinda just a dirt lot with fence. If your waking around Adams Ave. it's worth swinging by.< /review>< rate>

<review>I love how wide open it is. There can be three different events going on at the same time.
Playground, open field for soccer games, basketball court and a little walkway trail around the whole park. There is also a quaint little dog park as well.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate>< gmap_id>

This neighborhood park is located at the top of a new bike route up from Mission Valley. While the lone bathroom needed some cleaning, it was a welcomed sight to find it open to allow a respit when few now are available. 👍<//text>

< Review>
Normally walk and like coming to this park. Today was a different experience, city worker is careless and continued to cut grass as we passed by with my 7 month old baby and my 1 year old niece. I did let him know we were there however he did it again next time we passed by. Maybe he should've worried about picking up the branches that were all on sidewalk.</Review>

<Name>Drew Kroft</Name><text>Great neighborhood gem! This park provides a lot of space for a seemingly small view from the street. The day I was there, a family had party with a bouncy castle. Bouncy Castles can be noisy and hog some serious space. But, they had plenty of room and didn't inconvenience anyone. A couple of groups were throwing frisbees. And quite a few picnics were scattered around the park. The freeway runs nearby, but if there was any noise, it wasn't noticable.<//text><response>None</response>< pics>

Nice clean open park, close to a busy street but its closed off by a small fence (around 3ft6in high I'd say). Two playgrounds, one for smaller kids and the other for older kids. They're both surrounded by trees which is nice if trying to avoid a sunburn. A big grassy area space with a small amphtheater seating place.< /review>

This park is where I've held birthday parties. It's a nice park, friendly people, they have bathrooms, and good jungle gyms for the kids.
Sometimes there are the homeless living or wandering around which kills the vibe, but if you can ignore them then it isn't so bad.<//text>

Nice to have the safe space for the dogs, but time for grass and water! The bark is not comfortable for the dog's feet, although there is no bark left in the middle of the big dog side...it has all been pushed to the fence lines...now it is just dirt. And bits of tile that comes to the surface from the demolished houses that used to be on the property. Time to move forward with the next phase of the plan!</Review>

The playground is fine, and they have the perfect setup for an outdoor movie/show. The bathrooms were horrible. Two stalls total, no toilet paper, no soap, lots of poop on the floor. I can't imagine why they wouldn't have had someone clean on a Saturday before a community event. We had to leave as the movie was starting because my 6-year-old fell and had globs of poop stuck on him.< /text>

<review>A really nice park and playground, but be careful! There were many homeless and even some guys grouped together giving off a definite "gang vibe. There should be security. Also, someone should paint a kid friendly mural on that plain white building, so it's not such an eye sore.<//review>< Pics>

Pleasant, free. Basketball courts, playground, adjacent dog park, and plenty of grassy free space. If you play Niantic games, this place has a lot of points of interests (4 pokestops and 2 Gyms, one Ex raid gym) which is a great bonus :)</review>

<review>This Park has 2 great Dog  Parks! 1 for Small Dogs, the other for Big Dogs! They are clean & safe, completely fenced in & separated from one another. Our "Small Dog Friends of San Diego" had a great Meetup there!!! It's missing shady areas however, so when it's hot I suggest bringing some umbrellas... & plenty of water!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Having just moved to the neighborhood, I was delighted to discover Ward Canyon Park within walking distance of my house. The park is very large, consisting of a acres of grassy fields, and built in their area, children's play apparatus, and happily, a dog park!
There are several good grilling posts for bbqs and the park was quite green from all of the recent rains.

My only concern regards the clearly apparent homeless population that takes residence in the park. While walking on the path I spied several tents and a few areas of the park had trash buildup. The people I came across were nice, however and I'll be returning tomorrow with my dog to have some fun at the dog park.</Text>

Of the five parks I regularly visit, this one is my favorite. Two distinct jungle gyms (which split comfortably along age lines when the park is busy), bathroom (with junkies in it only occasionally), hoops, two sets of swings, clean water fountains, two attached off leash dog parks, and a huge wide open grassy area. The trees while bare in the winter provide great shade to make Ward Canyon tolerable even in the heat waves of september. I like the extreme diversity of families that visit here.  Weekends there's always multiple parties and bounce houses, and the mornings are dominated by kids under 5 while the median age grows as the day progresses. Sometimes they do free movies in the park here and watching Princess Bride with 3000 neighbors was a highlight.</Text>

I love this park. Great layout for a compact park. Great place for family and group picnics. Adjacent to an off leash dog park. Basketball court, a walk way the winds around the park, a picnic area and a large multi-function area in the middle.<//review>

It is a decent park, lot of room to take your kids, or dogs, there is a children's play area on one end and a basketball court on the other. However, it can be dirty as well as feel unsafe with quite a few homeless people camping there.<//text>

It used to be a safe park but recently I've noticed suspicious activities on the back parking lot.

Nice park, fairly clean, nice and spacious. Plenty of room to play games, relax, people watching, grill, picnics and such.

There is a small population of homeless, which seem to be polite and friendly.< /text>

This park is a great place for parties and barbeques with the family. There are sometimes bounce houses set up and multiple places to cook. Children's playground nearby and clean grass to layout. Nearby there are two off leash dog parks to let the pups play as well!< /text>

There were very respectful parents there. They were all looking out for children, making sure that they are safe. The place structures are nice but those bathrooms are a mess!!!!!!<//text>

I like: lots of trees. Plenty of kids come to play
Don't like: if you come early in the morning the playground is full of trash</review>

Two gyms for the kids and doesn't get too busy. Lots of room to play and there are also basketball courts. It is close the highway and parking is easy to find.<//Text>

Just like any other San Diego park, when the sun goes down be prepared to see and smell the homeless deficating in random places. However if you're interested, across the street in the cul-de-sac where the homeless tents are meth or heroin can be purchased. Seriously. I wish the city could get their act together and use these tax dollars they keep stealing from me and get this scum out of what otherwise would be a nice area.<//text>
