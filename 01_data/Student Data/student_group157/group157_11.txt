Overall, they did a great job considering it was cleaned in just under 15 minutes. I docked a star because you could still see remnants of the bird poop on the hood after their cleaning. But for a 15-ish minute cleaning it all came together very nicely.

Very friendly crew, fast turnaround, and hand-washed. I imagine that a cleaner car would've come out immaculate. I'll be back, hopefully with a car that isn't sporting a decent coating of ash and poop.<//Review><Name>Trevor Williams<//Name>< Rate>

I went in today to wash my brand new vehicle I purchased two weeks ago.
I bought a black toyota corolla LE , BRAND NEW.

Today was the first Time i have ever washed my car at all. And i chose to go there. The men washed the vehicle and I suspected nothing until after it was all done.

I checked my car to find that the whole entire car was scratched up. Very light scratches on the paint  throughout the entire car. It’s disappointing. No we did not get a refund for the $30 and the owner said nothing could be done for us.

They insisted that we bought a scratched up vehicle from the dealers.
Who buys a brand new scratched up car?

Then they decide to bring up that my door is dented on the side. Someone in a parking lot opened the door next to mine and it left a dent last week, it has nothing to do with the scratches left on my car today which correlate with the streak patterns of wiping/ washing that were left on the vehicle.

Truly sad, unbelievable service, no sympathy. No empathy.

I have a video of everything that was said, done and told.

Still don’t understand how they will tell ME that I bought a scratched car. Ridiculous. I have eyes.

And so do they, since one of the guys says there are no scratches but then again says there are scratches and to go to our insurance since they wont do anything to help us.

I hope you all please find yourself a different car wash, because they will not take accountability for what they do and tell you otherwise.

If I could just post a video on here for you all to see the guy telling us that we bought a scratched (all over) brand  new car.

No one god damn buys a brand new car with scratches everywhere.

My odometer reading is 40 miles. Brand new car.

Let me also add that the car is only 60% clean after the wash
The front two windows, still dirty and soapy, and all the crevices are dirty.
Im literally so confused on how they still are doing business.< /Review><Time>1599885086373< /Time>< rate>

Around $24/$25 for hand wash and dry, exterior only. Fast and professional. Someone greats you as you pull up, explains what you'll get, the price and what to do next. Good customer service.  Note: payment by card only the day I was there.< /Review>

I recently had my car detailed here on a busy weekend. They work on plenty of high end cars from BMW M's to Ferrari's and mine was not n exceptional either. They did a fabulous job, work was done with high professionalism and great attention to detail. I will always take my cars to this place and recommend them highly!!< /Text>

I’ve been coming here for years, and the last 3-4 times I’ve been (last 1 year overall) I have hated the entire experience. Most recently, they never answer the phone, and only doing exterior washes. Do better!<//Text>

<Review>Please tip the poor souls who are still working here.

Sadly, the most accessible, centrally located car wash that employed a score of hard working, diligent people is destined to be closed.

Apparently the land owners are turning the property into yet another luxury apartment building.

This city is losing all utility and is becoming a never ending landscape of apartment/condo buildings and restaurants.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Previous experience was good, but I arrived this morning with a packed schedule to find it closed, with neither their website nor Google indicating that they would be closed during regularly posted business hours. The website also didn't mention that they only do exterior cleaning now, which I guess is moot.< /review>

This place used to be pretty decent. You used to be able to select from 3 different car washes and they would do a pretty good job cleaning the inside and outside. Now since very recently they charge $25 for just the outside cleaning. Seems kinda strange for a place that was jam packed all the time. And in any case $25 for just the outside is a rip off, plenty of other places like Tower Car Wash that’ll do a better job cleaning your car for around $30 all in.<//review>

<text>Used to love this place, but as of Jan 2020, they only do exterior washes (no vacuuming, etc) and you no longer get a discount on gas with a wash. The gas and wash are two separate businesses now. It’s bizarre and kind of pointless and I don’t know how they’re going to stay in business with those two changes which were pretty much the only draws.< /text>< UserId.>

Use to be good. But they don't do the inside anymore and they charge 25$ for outside of the car wash..... waste of money.. I can just got to a gas station wash for 8$ and get the same job. Only came here for the inside and they don't offer it anymore. RIP.< /review>

Told them to take the fairing off my roof racks before putting it through the wash and they didn’t so they cost me about $400 worth of damage.

Went to speak to the manager and he told me to literally go away that it wasn’t his problem. I left the manager’s manager a voicemail and of course never heard back.

Found out numerous other people have also had damage stories from this place due to neglect. Will never go here again and can’t
recommend you do either.< /review>

They couldn't careless about cleaning my car. Did a horrible job. Eventually grabbed a towel and had to finish off their job. Floor mats weren't washed and rims were dirty despite the fact that I purchased  the "ultra" package. Spare you time and go somewhere else... 2 stars just because of the nice staff at the entrance and at the cashier.<//Text>

You can tell a lot by the volume of cars lined up for a wash. Everyone says this is the best car wash in SF. Granted, it is a well oiled machine. Same price as Matt and Jeffs in Novato: $37.< /Text>

< Review>
One of the few car wash locations in San Francisco. Fast and efficient! On a Saturday morning, I was in and out in about 25 mins, and that was with "The works" service. I also noticed that if you had kids with you, the friendly owner would offer toys or other distractions for the wait, which was a nice touch. Prices are reasonable for the area, so if you're like me and used to go to touchless car washes at gas stations, this is a much better upgrade. I'll definitely be back!<//Review>

<review>Unreliable. I am here on a day and time when they are supposed to be open but there is absolutely nobody here and no sign saying whether or not they plan to be here. I wasted a good chunk of my morning on this by getting here a bit early to try to get out early.

This looks like everybody here at this company knew they weren't coming in today but no one bothered putting a sign in the window to tell the whole line of people here waiting what was going on. I'm one of about a dozen people who waited here for nothing.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

<text>Moved to the Bay Area about 9 months ago and had yet to find a convenient way to get my car washed. I found Divisadero Touchless Car Wash on G+ and gave it a shot. Neclair did a great job! He did both the inside and outside of my car. I will continue to use this service. It was reasonable in price especially for the convenience and the quality of the wash. The best part of this company as well is the how they use alternative uses to reduce the amount of water. Great first experience!</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808580af098876a9:0x89f27fb63f8cb747<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

For $50 "The Works" , you get an unfinished carwash inside and out. Quality has declined and I know I won't be returning.
You drive away with suds left on your side mirrors, dripping water from your license plates (front and back), and trunk. The interior was barely wiped clean. I could've gotten an exterior wash and did  the interior myself and that would have been more value for my money.  Based on my previous experience and the reviews, it's a hit and miss. I prefer to go to a place where I can count on good quality service.<//review>

Do not go here!  If you do, pay for LOWEST level service because that's all you are going to get. Paid $42 for wash which included interior vacuum, and wheel rim cleaning. Rims weren't touched and It wasn't vacuumed, at all.  When I approached attendant about this, she had me move car to vacuum station asking me which part of the car I wanted vacuumed.  When I responded "all of it" she acted like I was being unreasonable.   Pope work.  Terrible service.< /Text>

<review>Not a place for nit pickers..  Great for average Joe less demanding types.  Car goes in dirty stinking, comes out clean and smelling good.  Good price, $32, way less expensive than Tower.

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Pretty nice touchless car wash option. You hand over your keys and they do the rest. Your car goes through a variety of washing stations. The basic package costs some $30 - they clean the exterior, but also vacuum and wipe the interior. You can wait on one of the benches provided, but the whole process is pretty efficient. My car was not entirely spotless, and I might have hoped for more given the investment, but it was still a decent result.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I used to scoff at paying for something that you could do yourself but really it is worth it to get your car washed here. For $35 you can get the full clean on the car windows interior and wheels. The wait was only about 15 minutes and the quality was pretty good. The friendly staff at the desk check you out and you're set to go again. Overall I'd recommend this location.<//review>

Was the worst car wash ever. Worth no more than $20.00 anyone who pays more is a fool. Don't waste your time and money, go somewhere else.

The basic car wash used to be pretty good, but it's been very disappointing for the past year. Does not matter if they are busy or not, the employees will vacuum and dry with the an embarrassingly lack of attention. The washing part is worse, with my side mirrors still dirty, and mud streaks still on the sides. It feels like I really did not get what I paid for yesterday.< /review>

Been going here sine they opened and have been satisfied with service and final product! They used to sell discount booklets which was great for my company however today just found out they discontinued this service.
Makes it difficult for our company and why?</Text>

Always great work over the last 25 years and super honest -- they found a pair of wireless beats we thought were lost and left them on the seat (as opposed to stealing them).<//Text>

They were fast, efficient and good price for the quality. There were at least three people scrubbing my car at all times. So much manpower! Don't be scared by the line, they are a well tuned operation though initially pulling up it seems a bit chaotic.< /Review>

They're not great but they're not bad either. I'd ask for the handwash to avoid the machine swirls. I come home and do the detailing after they're done, even after the "works" treatment.<//review>

Touchless all right - you'll think no one touched you car once they are done.

Seriously though - they waxed over bird droppings and crap making it harder to remove, and there was smutz all over the inside of the car. Friendly guys, but I'm not going back.<//Text>

Good overall. Convenient location in the city but much more expensive than South City Car Wash. Driving down to South City isn't always practical so you pay a premium to do it in the city.<//text>

Considering the critical draught in CA it's pretty bad time to have a carwash operating, you guys should stop the business until things get back to normal. Also having your car clean right now is synonymous of shallowness.<//Text>

never too late to make a review. I ordered from them just a small item over a year ago. And it shipped the same day and i got the item the day after. that's faster than Amazon Prime I would say. Living in CA helps too :) Anyway, fast shipper, great prices. 5/5 stars from me<//review>

Waiting on my item that i ordered back in nov 1st they claimed i would received it before Thanksgiving here i am less than a week away from Christmas and nothing no tracking info or any ETA  i have called many times some straight to voicemail but no one would reach out and the 2 times someone answer they claim they have no info on my order..  I wanted to cancel my order and was told I would only receive store credit..  at this point all I can do is suggest everybody to stay stay away from here bad service and so unprofessional no one knows anything save yourself a headache... im stuck waiting on my $1400  speaker< /Review>

Awesome customer service! There was a little mix-up with my order, and I had to wait an extra week or 2...but everything worked out in the end. Customer service was friendly and helpful. Overall, I'm very pleased with my experience...aside from that little mix-up. But I would definitely do business with them again! And the prices were excellent too!<//Review>

Great Price and Quick Shipping!!
I just ordered and installed a DDX9705S last week.  I have to admit I was nervous based on the reviews, but the price was very tempting.   I took a chance and was very pleased with the service.   I ordered over the weekend and got my shipping information on Monday and received the head unit that Friday.  Will buy again.< /Text>

< Review>
I wanted to invest in putting some quality bass for my 2015 BMW X5. I had a few ideas of what exactly I wanted, but needed more reference and information for my ride. I researched other car audio sites, but ONLINE CAR STEREO provided me with the intel to make my decision. They proved to be the right choice. I purchased a KICKER 46TL7T124 (12' self-enclosed subwoofer), along with a JL RD1000 (amplifier). Their knowledgeable staff assured me both items were more than compatible with one another. So much, that if I wanted to upgrade my system, it wouldn't be too much of a task. The sound generating from my components was very crisp and clear. Zero to no distortion and quality bass. I was very pleased with my purchase! I would definitely recommend shopping from ONLINE CAR STEREO to anyone who is looking to upgrade their car sounds...!!!< /Review>

Don't believe what the website tells you they do not price match competitors and be sure to shop around they did not have the best price  on this item so please shop around whats funny is  I received an email from onlinecarstereo.com customer service informing me that they would work things out to place my order I just needed to call them so I called and they would not be able to apply the discount code that was listed on their website after calling they told me it was an old promo code and that  they cannot price match even though i had a screen shot as proof in talking to customer service and of the promotion they were also not able to match the price of a authorized competitors website so be warned and make sure you shop around don't believe we what they tell you just my opinion.</text>

DO NOT BUY FROM HERE. They give you 14 days to return from the original purchase date and if you're not happy with what you got they will not take items back. You have to lie and say there was something wrong with the equipment which is ridiculous. There is a 15% restocking fee and you have to pay for your own shipping. You are better off paying a little more or the same pretty much anywhere else. Good Luck<//text>

<text>This is truly the most horrible company we have experienced. We ordered 2 car stereos. When we got them they sent the wrong ones and said it's our fault that we ordered the wrong ones. We had to pay to ship it back they charged us a restock fee and then charged us more money for the right ones. They was suppose to be shipped which was a lie. We finally asked for our refund And guess what day 5, they continue to say the same thing. Your refund will be in your account by the end of the day. Still hasn't happened. Out 400.00. PLEASE SHOP SOMEPLACE ELSE!!! If I could comment without a star I sure would give them a - 10000< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Buyer beware- Shady business practices. I was sent lower end subwoofers than what i paid for, after sending woofers back they didn't refund all of $ claiming they are following their policy on returns? I did not receive what i paid for i would expect Online Car Stereo to step up and see that the mistake was theirs which it clearly was. I'm out I'm out $70 for shipping and handling?! Management refused to make things right after giving them the benefit of the doubt. They are more concerned about $70 than their reputation (which is priceless) Stay away from OnlineCarStereo!   DEC2020 update- I see onlinecarstereo replied (1 year later) . They still did not credit me the $70.. lies..<//text>

The customer service was great and I got the goods in time and in good condition, they carry most of the brands I'm interesting in, one time I had to exchange the product cause I made a mistake in my order and the customer service was great! with no questions or hesitation they ask me to send the product back and they sent me the one I wanted.

I have recently had the pleasure of doing business with Online Car Stereo to purchase a JL Audio sound system for my 2015 Chrysler 300c. They had every item I was searching for and also offered a great payment plan. Juan was my salesman and besides assuring me the best price, he made the whole process quick and easy. I would highly recommend Online Car Stereo to anyone who is looking for any car audio upgrades. Thanks again to Juan and the entire staff at Online Car Stereo!</review>

<Text>Since the company changed owners, I did not have a good experience. I ordered a pair of sub woofers. After a week waiting on them they tell me they don't even have them and do not know when they will get them in. I called and asked if they had a different pair. After being on  hold most of a half hour they said they had them. They were twice the price but I said I needed them. After another week waiting on them, they tell me they did not have those and did not know when they would get them. I ordered different pair again. So after almost one month I finally got a pair of sub woofers. Not sure I want to use this company any more.<//Text>< Rate>

<Text>Very poor and shady customer service.  It took them a week to notify me that my item (which was in stock according to their web site) was out of stock.  I called to cancel my order and they apologized and said it would be cancelled right away.  Two days later I get another email about my order and I see that it still had not been cancelled.  So after another phone call they were able to get it cancelled.<//Text>< Time>

<review>If I could I would give this company a minus rating.  I purchased an amplifier through them and after having it installed, it didn't work.  I called to get a replacement and took weeks to get someone to answer the phone or email.  I finally got a RMA and was told to expect a 6 week turn around.  I called the manufacturer of the amplifier and they were confused why it would take so long.  They suggested getting a refund and order through someone else.  Guess what I can't get an answer from the company now.  2 months later I am told they will not refund my money but I will have an "in-store credit"  I have to order by phone and guess again no one answers.  I filed a complaint with the better business bureau.  Do not trust this company with your money.< /review>< Resp>

If I could give this company a zero star rating I would have with no hesitation. It is truly unbelievable how poorly they treat their customers. My order never shipped. I was on the phone with them several times and was hung up on by the customer service staff. I tried reasoning and asking for explanations and was told "if you cannot understand simple information and what is put into our emails we wouldn't have a problem canceling your order." This company deserves to be burnt into the ground. I suggest ANY other company for car stereo products.</review>

Let's start a CLASS ACTION law suit against this company for misrepresentation of the phrase customer service. They took my Alpine back held on to it for 3 months before shipping back to me with exactly the same issue. Never even tried to fix the problem. What a waste of $529.00 I had to purchase another stereo from a reputable business that does not remove the serial numbers.</Review>

Worst experience ever.  They cancelled my order for no reason and did not even let me know.  Were supposed to call me back once I called to find out why and never did.  Don't answer the phone most of the time and when they do you hold forever. Use Amazon.< /Review>

<Text>Terrible customer service. Returned something well within the 60 day return period and had to fight to get a refund. The item was returned in the original packaging unused. Totally incompetent employees. I was also charged a 20% restocking fee when their website clearly states hat 10% restocking fee "might" be applied.  This outfit is shady. Shop somewhere else.<//Text><response>None< /response><UserId.>107208274492765903972</UserId.><name>Jake Braitman<//name>< Pics>

How long should a refund take?  1 week? 2 weeks? Longer?  Every time I get burned by this company I swear I will never shop there again.  Undoubtedly they end up being the only place that has an item I would like and I purchase with a heavy heart.  Once again I am reminded I should stick to my guns and not click Buy!< /text>

I returned an item for a refund and it took a little over a month to receive my refund. I had to call them seven times to check the status of my refund before they finally processed it. Each time I called, the operator told me that it was going to be processed the next day, however, that day never came until about the 37th day from the day they received my returned item. If you're looking for a place to purchase car stereo items for what looks to be the lowest price online and don't care for good customer service, then this is the site for you. Otherwise, stay clear from them as they are a true headache to deal with.< /text>< pictures>

Return process has been very prolonged with no communication from the retailer upon receiving the merchandise.  Long time on hold waiting for customer service representative. Returned item sat for 7 days at warehouse before being "logged in at returns department".  Beware.  Make sure whatever you order is exactly what you want and will fit.  Do not plan on returning or exchanging items without major aggravation.  This online retailer is NOT Amazon.< /Text>

Despite all the negativity listed, i've been ordering equipment from these guys since 2006 and i've always been satisfied.  Granted the Customer Service can be problematic, however, I've always had a good experience.  They are a smaller company based out of California, so when I order equipment, I typically receive it in 2 or 3 days after i've been informed of the shipment.  Have to admit, their prices are awesome and are hard to beat.  If you don't need to involve "customer service", you will be satisfied.<//Review>

<Review>I bought a Pyle PLD93BK last year.  It broke and I was told to pay the postage and return it.  It cost me $30 CAD to send it back and it took one year and many many phone calls to get a replacement.  I then was told that I was required to pay an additional $60. US as well as the postage cost to have it mailed to my US address (they refused to mail it to my Canadian address).  They also refused to pay for the postage.  The end result was that I may as well have thrown it out because it cost me the same amount to get a replacement DVD player.  Do not buy anything from OnLine Car Stereo.  They have the worst customer service.<//Review>< Pics>

DO NOT BUY from this company.Total Scam .Like a fool  I sent a check in for a item, they cashed it allright and after I was told item shipped and guess what item was  not in stock.Now I have been hung up on and lied to about my refund.Juan told me he didn't care if he I tried to get him fired and hung up on me twice.One month has went by and nothing.Im probably out 120.00 bucks.I will be contacting states attorney and BB but I will not hold my breath.Oh forgot to mention one thing they say they are authorized dealer for JVC but guess what They are not.</text>

The customer service department is absolutely terriable. Needs to be renamed The 'doing you a favor by taking your money and making a profit off what we  sell you so dont expect anything else department'. I tried to purchase a CLS113RG-W7AE... Which is a JL Audio 13.5 W7 Sub and Engineered Enclosure. One of the top 3 if not the best Sub you can get. Retails for $1,400.00 a piece. I attempted to purchase this from their website. Under the Add to Cart button they advertise that THIS item qualifies for free shipping.  Not the tab at the top of the screen that says orders over $99.00 qualify for free shipping. But the item I was checking out. Not only that when I checked out and paid for the item it did not charge me for shipping. I added the 3day air for $29.95 because it was coming from California and I live in Pennsylvania. I then receive an email stating that I needed to reply to the email or contact their customer service department instructing them to send me a PayPal money request for an additional $29.95 because the weight and size of the item.  Now mind you all of these enclosures with the sub weights the same and they are all the same size. So I am thinking to myself, "why did the website and the check out and processing repeat "free ground shipping" and not charge me for it but now I am receiving an email stating other wise"...... So I call the NON-customer service department to ask this totally inappropriate and ridiculous question, RIGHT! The goon that answered the phone went over the email. I then explain the events above. He goes on to tell me about the disclaimer on the website stating some items that are over weight and blah blah blah will incur extra charges. I then explain again that all the speakers weight the same and....... (He Cuts Me Off). "Sir, I already explained to you our disclaimer, its simple enough to understand. I guess your just not getting it". Now he must know taking a tone like that with a customer who is spending $1,000.00, or any customer really, is going to respond appropriately. I then reinforce my position by explaining that I understand Fully what policies and disclaimers are, their meaning and intent. I was simply bringing to your attention that it was not a general statement that shipping was free but expressed this in fact because I had already check out and to avoid any further confusion and delay that it would be advantageous to just add the charge during the check out process. He then becomes even more condescending saying how he just needs to know what I want to do. I then reply and say well I probably would have moved on with he conversation if he used decent business ethic and treated the phone call for what it was..... A CONVERSATION! He then suggested that we just cancel the order. So I replied with "Go ahead you child, cancel the order". I would have paid the extra money I just wanted to understand what was happening and shed some light on their system. If this is how you want to be treated then by all means buy away, for I will be staying far far away from these Nincompoops!!!!<//Review>

<user_name>Jonathan Garcia< /user_name><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I am in complete awe that management either doesn't know or just simply allows these horrible representatives to hang up on customers and talk disrespectfully to them they are the worst in customer service I've ever come across. I tried to order product from them with 3 day shipping that charged my card on Monday and was "shipped" on Wednesday 2 days later, only to call them 2 days later in a Friday to find out it has not been shipped and got shipped Friday that evening, so Tuesday rolls around and I call UPS to get some info on the tracking to find out these fools haven't even given the package to UPS in the first place!!!! I can OCS back to call them out and this sorry excuse of worker tells me I'm being impatient and that if I don't want to wait he will cancel my order. Then as I'm telling him to NOT cancel my order he goes on to cancel it WITHOUT my authorization! I hope someone from higher up sees this review and takes care of this cause his or her workers will ruin online sales of their product. Worst company to deal with in customer service you will not get your stuff and now I'm trying to get my money back which I'm having a hard time doing! DO NOT DO ANY BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE ITS ALL A MASSIVE SCAM FULL OF LIES FROM THEM AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!!</text>< date>

I'm so blessed to have these people right next to us in happy Valley no sense of driving to town for a real Burger when you can have it right next door. They are family owned and they work their hineys off to supply a awesome product nothing like a franchise. Support your local small businesses! these guys rock!</Review>

<Review>Pibbs is an amazing local family owned and operated restaurant and pizza parlor. The food is just amazing, I've had the pizza ( pepperoni, and all meat ) and there French dip. There pizzas are very reasonable priced and great tasting. The French dip is the best in the redding Anderson area.</Review>< user_name>

What a fantastic place for a family gathering! Had my 4 year old granddaughters birthday there today. There were 20+ of us. Could not have asked for a better experience. Service was excellent. Food was delicious. Kids were entertained with the free video games and they even put the movie Frozen on one of the big screens. Highly recommended for any gathering! Check this place out!<//Review>

Overall bad experience, food was not good or worth the money, even after giving them a 2nd chance at ordering from there. Food has no taste to it and it’s all over priced for the quality you get. Never going back and you shouldn’t either!< /text>

Just got home from dinner with my oldest son at PIBBS. We had their pizza.  Top notch in my mind! Each had our own. The staff is great! It’s a family run establishment, and you can feel it. The owners are in house cooking and walking around building relationships with their customers. You know you can always go in and get a smile and warm welcoming. I recommend that you should go in and experience it for yourself.< /text>

Went to try out the new diner in Happy Valley and found the owners are people we have known for years. Michelle and Crystal are there to feed you well! The place looks great and the burgers were excellent!

Great atmosphere to bring the family. We look forward to trying everything on the menu! Outstanding service. Recommend you take a lovely drive/bike ride out to the valley and get HAPPY!< /Review>

Great new place in anderson.   Food and service are great.  Especially love layout of restaurant.   Allows for "grownup"area and kids and family area.  This gives nice space for those of us with no children to enjoy the outing.  Will return.</review>

First time visiting PIBBS. The restaurant was clean and inviting. We were greeted immediately and invited to sit wherever we wanted, and directed to the location of the menus. Good selection of burgers and pizzas. I tried the Old Burger (just a burger), that came with fries. It was a good burger. We also had pizza that everyone enjoyed. Friendly staff. Decent prices. Solid four stars in my opinion. When hankering for a burger &fries, I will likely return.
For those who enjoy sports, there are several TVs showing games and a TV for kids entertainment.<//review>

<Time>1575950326546<//Time><rate>5</rate><Review>I've gone there maybe about five to six times now, and the service has always been excellent.  The hamburgers are all I really can give an opinion on, but for the price point I would say that they are very good. And are comparable to the products of places that sell their hamburgers for around 5 to $6 more. I go there with my family at least twice a month, and I have yet to have a bad experience. the only small gripe I have, is that when I order a rare hamburger it usually comes out medium to medium rare. But, I can fully understand that due to the risks of a lawsuit if someone does happen to get food poisoning. It is a good family diner, and does include a small arcade. If you take time to read this, I recommend at least trying the place out. My favorite is the "Heater" a mildly spicy burger with jalepeneos, sirrachia sauce, and pepperjack cheese as it's focus.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>My family and I were in on the evening of Oct 7th (last night). The service was amazing, the food some of the best we’ve had around the area, and the decor was great. I’m so glad we have this out here in HV. The owner, Crystal, took time to be super sweet to my daughter and it was memorable because when asked today what “her friend at PIBBS” name was she happily said, “Ms Crystal!”
Thanks for opening up such a friendly place! We are new to the area and felt so welcomed. It was really nice that there are senior and veteran discounts. My spouse is a veteran and was so surprised by this. We will be back for sure!!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>I went in with my hair below my chin. I came out with it like an inch long. I asked for half to be cut and they cut like 80% of it. They don’t know how to cut long hair. Do not recommend it if you have long hair.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Fresh cuts...very few places that I feel comfortable getting a hair cut for me and my boys! Not a lot of barbers know how to cut “OUR” hair! Shout out to Joe's and bro’s!< /review>

<text>First time at this Barbershop today and I was very satisfied. Shout out to Milton who took care of me! I walked in and was in the chair in less than one minute. Great haircut and nice looking barbershop inside. Plus there is 8 barbers inside ready to go. No waiting in line for hours like other places. Go check them out< /text>< user_id>

Please I repeat do not come here my total was 58.89 and me and my dad order the cheapest thing there is because we were hungry but didn't want to eat that much but my mom and my sister shared a plate of soup because for the price we thought we were going to get a pretty big soup that plate wasn't even filled half way me and my dads plate was so disappointing but I said whatever small portions can be delicious yeah no it was disgusting the food was cold I think it might of been microwaved because I hate microwaved food and I know when it is. And then my has anxiety so he left the restaurant to go get some air when they noticed they thought we were gonna leave without paying when they quickly started doing the recipe and they threw it at us and we weren't even finish when I see the price I was speechless I'm never coming here again the customer service terrible</Text>< pics>

We were sitting down for almost one hour, others that came after us got served before us. Others ordered soup like we did, they got served first even though we were here first. Kept making excuses on why the food wasn't here yet. Kept giving us bad looks.< /Review>

Horrible place to go! I went there placed a order and was given no receipt asked for it and was told to sit down 3 times. I cancelled the order. 😯😣😣 Worst part about it the place was empty and said order took 20min.<//review>

<text>My first experience eating food from this place was awesome! I didn't think I would like anything. When I had a bite of those pancakes!! Omg!! Hm hm hm. Perfect. The pancakes were sweet and buttery already so you didn't have to butter and syrup them if you didn't want to. So good. Only downfall is that is far from me since I live on the other side of the valley.</text>< date>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Yes! Their prices are ridiculously high. The food isn't that tasty. They lied about not having fat in their burritos🤢 And on Monday's they advertise 99¢ pupusas; so I sent my son to order three, and they charged him $8.60 for them, so I called and asked: how much are your pupusas, and one of them (I'm certain it was the owner) said $2.50, then I said: but aren't they 99¢ on Monday's? She said yes, but only the bean & cheese and the pork & cheese. Well guess what? We only ordered two pork and cheese pupusas and one bean and cheese pupusa. 🙄🤔😪

<Review>Worst customer service in town. They over charge you, the menu prices are not even current so you ended up paying at least five dollars more than you expect plus they charge you for making a card transaction.  I would not recommend this place at all< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Customer service is not good at all. I bought some pupusas special, that's only for take out, asked for a fork and was told that it doesn't come with a plastic fork. I was told "that's why it is a special". Wow! Hopefully the food is good otherwise my rating will go down to a 1 star.<//Text>< pics>

< review>
The Worst experience eating Salvadorean Food. I don't even know where to start. It was the most disgusting experience meaning the food and horrible I mean HORRIBLE customer service! As my family and I arrived we were greeted and promptly seated. We order Popusas and tamales de Elote.The NIGHTMARE started when the popusas arrived with a BAD smelling curtido (cabbage salad) that tasted and looked so old. To top it off the tamale de Elelote were GREASY and super small. I kindly asked the waitress to change our curtido and she confirmed it was the only one and that’s its been in refrigerator for days...DISGUSTING! I Finally asked to talk to the manager: the guy and a girl came to talk to us. The guy was calm but the lady was rude and aggressive. She rudely called us cheapskates because we refuse to pay for the tamales that we didn’t touch. She’s lucky my boyfriend still paid for the horrible popusas with nasty cultido. To be honest I would Never return !! the food and service were Horrible! I don’t recommend anyone to bring their families there. It’s a disgrace to Salvadorean food. I will be contacting the Health Inspector, food like this shouldn’t be sold in our communities. I mean if someone gives you an honest review as an owner you should be humble try to reason with your customers, it’s sad the attitude and vision this restaurant give to the Salvadorian community it should be removed or fixed pronto!!!!
HORRIBLE !!!!! ZERO STARS!!!<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Ended up in this restaurant only after the restaurant I originally wanted to go to was super busy. I mean what could possibly go wrong its only pupusas. Right?! As I get there Im quickly greeted as the restaurant was not busy at all. I proceeded to order my drinks, pupusas and an order of tamales de elote. Food timing was not bad about a 10 minute wait. Pupusas were average, not the best but definitely not the worse. But the curtido(cabbage salad) that the pupusas came with tasted like they've been sitting in storage for weeks. No flavor and tasted like refridgerator. Absolutely disgusting!!!! Drinks were good but the tamales arrived and they were the smallest greasiest corn tamales I have ever seen. They also appeared to be old and reheated ones. That was the last straw and I decided to talk to the manager in which a guy arrived and he was courteous and nice but the lady, she was a feisty one let me tell you. As I proceeded to tell her the curtido salad was really bad and that the tamales looked bad as well and that I didnt even touch them due to it I didn't want to pay for them. She rudely called me a cheapskate for not wanting to pay for them. I mean shes lucky I even payed for my food after that comment but whatever I just advised her that her restaurant was serving a poor excuse of Salvadorean food and proceeded to pay for my bill except for the nasty tamales which were fried after I had ordered them regular not fried, I should add! Lol. I still feel like taking her a plate of real Salvadorean food from one of my spots as a sample to show her what real authentic Salvadorean food is supposed to taste like. But for now I think a good old visit from the health inspector might be a good start to get them on the right track. Lol. I dont know why so many people on here gave this food a 4-5 star review I assure you this is a poor excuse of Salvadorean food. But to each their own I guess.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
I don't like this place because the customer service is horrible. The pupusas are delicious but only if eaten there. It's not as clean you can see crumbs and trash under the tables. The reason for disliking it is because the owner told me off because I had a water bottle. I did not want to pay for water I didn't like or get sink water so naturally I thought of bringing my own but she could have kindly said she did not want water in her restaurant. Really don't think I'm coming back after that. You should treat your customers correctly not attack them for not knowing they can't bring their own drinks.

No me gusta este lugar por que el servicio al cliente es terrible. Las pupusas son deliciosas pero no mas si las come en el restaurante. No es tan limpio si ve abajo de las mesas ay basurita. La rason por que me disgusta es por que la duena fue grosera no mas por traer bebida de afuera. Era agua y la rason por que no agare agua ayi es porque no quieria tener que tomar agua de la llave. No creo que regresara no le daria mi dinero a quien trate sus clientes mal.<//Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) What a sadness today I went to this place with my sister and our girls, one of 8 and the other of almost 3 ... we parked I was CRYING FOR PERSONAL PROBLEMS the 8-year-old girl was able to make her a ponytail in her hair ... more chikita, just to cheer me up, she asked the same thing as we took a long time to get in, a very despotic woman with burned guero painted hair came out and a very loud mouth to see what we were doing. I was drying my tears .. and she said no ... but they can't bring food from another place ... it was a fucking happy meal of 5 dollars for the girl of 3 we told her but it's for her and she said no ...
I left with my family disappointed in this familiar place .... the discrimination is enough with Trump please give education classes to your employees ... there were no people inside we went to another place and thank you because there they treated us with great respect. $ 70.00 bull plus tip ... talk to the one who made delicious pupusas ... and that place had people I was not alone.

Que tristeza hoy fui a este lugar con mi hermana y nuestras ninas una de 8 y la otra de casi 3..  nos parkiamos YO IVA LLORANDO POR PROBLEMAS PERSONALES la  nina de 8 podio que le hiciera una cola de caballo en el pelo.. la mas chikita solo por animarme pidio lo mismo como nos tardamos en entrar salio una mujer muy despota de pelo pintado de guero quemado y muy bocona a ver que estabamos haciendo yo me estaba secando las lagrimas.. mi hermana le dijo ahorita nos metemos hay un problema y ella dijo no... pero no pueden meter comida de otri lugar.. era un pinche happy meal de 5 dollars para la nina de 3 le dijimos pero es para ella y dijo no...
Me fui con mi familia desepcionada de este lugar familiar.... la descrimiacion es suficiente con trump por favor den clases de educacion a sus empleados... no habia gente adentro fuimos a otro lugar y gracias porq alla nos trataron con mucho respeto el bull de $70.00 mas propina... hable con la que hizo ricas pupusas... y ese lugar tenia gente no estaba solo.

(Translated by Google) I would not give them a single star.
But beware. Count change your changes because they no longer give you a good deal. Tuesday at 5:40 AM July 31. So that they remember me, the lady of the restaurant.
Although the food is good.

It's serious ...
Warning !!!!

No Les Daria ni una Estrella.

<Review>(Translated by Google) They should put better k is a bar to not bring minor children to this place x the type of wardrobe k have the waitresses and perhaps they believe that the men go to see them and when the men stare at them they no longer focus on attending If not in modeling them I and I attended like that in dining rooms I would say but I was going to what I was going to attend as it should 😎😎😎

(Original)
Le deberían de poner mejor k es barra para no llevar niños menores a este lugar  x el tipo de vestuario k tienen las meseras y quizás cren que los hombres a verlas a ellas van y cuando los hombres se le queda viendo ya no se enfocan en atender si no en modelarles yo e atendido así en comedores diria yo pero yo iva a lo que iva a atender como se debe 😎😎😎<//Review>< Pics>

Gorgeous outdoor venue for weddings, public functions, wine pairing, and BBQ get togethers.  Nice outdoor facilities for dining, dancing with a pleasant grassy area - all based at the foothills in quaint San Benito County.  Gorgeous views in a historical setting.  Highly recommended!< /Text>

<Text>We were guests at a wedding over a month ago. When I got home and realized I lost my gold earring, I immediately tried to contact them in hopes it was found during the clean up. Their phones don’t ring, they don’t respond to emails, even the bride tried to reach someone with no response. What kind of venue advertises as a wedding venue and doesn’t answer the phone. I’m hoping this review will get their attention to respond to my request for help. My next attempt to get ahold of someone is through snail mail 😏</Text>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1562952942665, 'text': "Hi Rosemary, my name is Mary and I'm the Event Center Manager out here.  I am so sorry that you have been unable to reach us.  We have been using internet phones and our system completely crashed.  We were trying to get a new system that would allow us to keep the same number and we filed paperwork to keep it without any luck.  I just got an email this morning that our phones will be up next week with a new number.  I have been giving everyone that reaches  me by email my cell phone number for the past two months.  Again, I am so sorry, this inconvenience with the phone has been awful for everyone!  Unfortunately your earring has not been found.  After each wedding, we carefully check the floors of the barn before we blow it out because we don't want any trash or debris blown into our grounds.  I will keep an eye out for it outside and if it turns up, I will contact you.  Can you please email me with all of your contact information at mary@paicinesranch.com.  Thank you and again, I apologize for all of the trouble you've had to go through!"}<//resp><gmap_id>0x809217f6bbaba02d:0x4297810f55e76cde< /gmap_id></record>

Beautiful wedding venue.  Staff was friendly and kept premises clean throughout the wedding.  Lighting was perfect with decorative sconces on the wall.  I will be recommending my clients to have their events at Paicines Ranch.</Review>

(Translated by Google) We visited the place because we attended a wedding, the place is very beautiful and the accommodations are very good, it is a great place for events. It is a site committed to sustainability and they take care of their lands responsibly, the landscapes are very beautiful and it is worth going to enjoy nature. Good place for birding.

Visitamos el lugar por que asistimos a una boda, el lugar es muy bonito y las acomodaciones muy buenas, es un gran lugar para eventos. Es un sitio comprometido con la sustentabilidad y cuidan responsablemente sus tierras, los paisajes son muy bonitos y vale la pena ir a disfrutar de la naturaleza. Buen sitio para pajarear.< /text>

<Review>Not a friendly staff however the place is clean and they don’t bother you no matter how late you or your guests come or go.
The rooms are nicely appointed and are heated and/or air conditioned well.
The location is good although not super, as some harassment and muggings have occurred in the immediate area during my visits.
The rates are not low, but are reasonable, all things considered and there are several very tasty well priced restaurants within walking distance.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2c798691fe053:0x48b960f3773e37a4</gmap_id><response>None</response>< Pics>

Very happy with this accommodation. Is a real fine. The rooms are much better than the outside of building appears and fitted to a modern standard. Had microwave and fridge but don't need to use. Comfortable work station. Wifi working fast for me. The room blacks out very well. Very comfortable bed with big screen TV. Excellent value for money.< /Text>

Big screen tv and the bed is very comfortable. Has a fridge, microwave and coffee pot. Decor is modern and it's very quiet. Parking is extremely limited but street parking is free after 8pm.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Don't be fooled by the pictures. I’m honestly bewildered on how this place is still standing and has not been forced to shut down due to the numerous but similar complaints. While the rooms are cheap, you get what you paid for. First off the guy up front gave creepy vibes. I told him my name and that I had booked a room in advance. He was mostly concerned with where I parked. Confused I told him in the lot and he says there’s a $15 fee. $15 for parking in a ridiculously tight parking space. If you own a truck, you’re better off parking somewhere else, otherwise you’ll scrape your sides trying to get out. That’s exactly what happened to us by the way. He turns on his security monitor and has the audacity to tell me to fix my car when the as*hole next to us took up 2 spaces. There’s really nothing special about this place. The halls are dingy and old and the walls are extremely thin. Unless you want to hear your neighbor’s bed creaking and nonstop moaning at night, this isn’t the place for you. I woke up to several bug bites on my arm as well. This place is dirty and overall disgusting and you will not get your money back.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Parking lot is super tiny but there's street parking. The room is small. The place is old but is as clean as it can be. The girl at counter was super nice. Tip.  Never book through price line.   They didn't have my reservation. Good thing the girl was nice and gave me the room for 99/night.  But then again she could've been lieing. 😐<//Text>

Rooms are amazing for the price. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Parking is very small but was not a problem for us as we did not have a car as we checked the information about the hotel before we got there.< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><Text>If I could give this hotel a 0 I would. I booked online, and no where does it state that this place charges you an extra $100.00 for a deposit along with the $102.00 the room cost. The staff is very very rude, they barely spoke English. It was also not stated that there was no parking, so we actually had to park almost a mile away and walk to this hotel. The hotel is very small, along with my room. There was a hole in the comforter so I'm hoping they don't try to charge me for that. It just wasn't worth the money or the stay. Yes the rooms are nice looking, but when taking a shower the shower was at a weird slant and it was clogged so the water just sits in there covering over your feet. There were no real TV Channels to watch at night. All in all I just can't recommend this place. You will be very disappointed.<//Text></record>

This place is awful from beginning to end. It started with the check in. We booked through priceline, and it said that check in was at 4 am. Not the most unusual thing that I've experienced. I rang the bell at the front desk, and proceeded to wait 10 minutes for a person to answer. The man that did treated me like an idiot. Said that check-in wasn't until 2 pm. Okay, sure. We went found a place to catch some missed sleep. Came back at 2. Charged a hidden 100 fee, and the parking that was advertised as first-come was actually a pay-to-park, parking. It was also 20 dollars a day which is more than downtown parking. It is equal to parking at the convention center. I ended up complaining to priceline to be refunded for the second day. The room was clean, but the entire motel smells like they just put new carpet over old carpet. If you want a good place to relax and sleep. Go anywhere else. In addition, the night we did stay, we got bit up by bugs.<//text>

The Good.
Comfortable newer bed, Large newer TV, The excellent coffee machine, the price.
Also for me the location was good considering it is about a 15 min walk to the L.A. live entertainment area.

The Bad.
The parking (5 parking spots total and one of them are handicapped). The building is old like alot of other buildings in the area but the room I had was recently and decently remodeled considering what they have to work with.

Other thoughts..... This place needs more parking. I was afraid to move my car once I got there knowing the free parking spot would be gone when I got back.
Across the street is a Ramada Inn. They don't have the good coffee machine like The Staples Center Inn but their parking situation is better. I paid $25 more a night to stay there after two nights at SCI. In my opinion it was worth it mostly because of the parking plus the rooms are larger and had a hot tub. Still a bit run down like SCI but it had what I needed and then some.< /Text>

I made a reservation for this place and arrived at about 8pm. There was gang activity in the street and I could not get into the small parking lot. I drove around the place three times and finally was able to begin to turn when I was approached by a lady who was outside asking me what I wanted. "what do you want here". I told her I had a reservation at the Inn and she said "go find a spot out on the street then walk back. I told her about the fighting that had just happened and she said that was ok. I told her I would be unsafe walking with my three small children and she just told me "you will be ok my personal car is out in the community as well.

I drove off and called the reservation line to ask how I could be safe walking in this area however the same lady answered. I told her that I would have to cancel and she told me "well too bad, you will still have to pay, so do what you want." I explained that I had three small children in the car and that I would be unable to carry all three of them inside  the hotel if I had to walk from 1/2 mile in such a bad area and she said too bad.

keep in mind when I first showed up there was already a fight and she was outside watching the whole thing that is how she approached my car in the first place. I had to drive away for safety purposes.

Maybe the lady did not understand my problem since she did not speak fluent English but I am calling my CC in morning. i am going to assume that she did not expect me to carry all three kids from within the dangerous community all by myself.
good luck if you stay here! The community is Super bad and your safety is not guaranteed as the lady will imply.< /text>

< review>
The wifi is incredibly slow, impossible tl connect to any website, and I had to use my mobile data instead. The staff are not professional, some of them are not polite, didn't greet me as I Wales in and called my room phone in the morning with one word "check out". Obviously can't speak English and don't know anything about customer service. Although the room is clean, I still suggest avoiding this place.

<Review>This place is terrible! They have 4 parking spaces out back and the rude manager blocked us in and told us that was typical. And you can hear every time someone else leaves their room because the walls are this and the doors slam hard. Not to mention on our last day I found baby clothes in our room and we don't have a baby. I was so disgusted. Go to the Ramada across the street. They have plenty of parking and a pool!<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>The whole place has very creepy, negative vibes. Very little parking. Came at night and ended up having to park in an overnight garage near by and then taking an Uber to the hotel. After checking in and getting to our room, we sat down on the bed and within a couple of minutes found bugs crawling on us. We decided that we would not be able to sleep here so we went downstairs and asked for a refund. Upon arriving to the desk, there were TWO OTHER COUPLES ALSO COMPLAINING ABOUT THEIR ROOMS. The lady told us that we were LYING and that there were NOT bugs in the bed. I asked very politely if we could be refunded since we had not been in the room for more than 5 minutes and did not unmake the bed or even use the restroom. She offered to upgrade us to a king suite for free, but because of how rude she was about "lying" about bugs, and the heebie jeebies we got from the place, we really just wanted to find somewhere else to stay. She said that it was hotel policy that there were no refunds within 24 hrs before check-in (she was unable to show me anywhere in the lobby, outside the hotel, or on their website about any refund policy). I got impatient and eventually just asked for her to refund our second night, since we wouldn't be staying there. Still she said they do not do refunds. I asked why, because that night WAS 24 hrs away. She then said that since we booked through Expedia, we would have to go through Expedia for the refund. After speaking to Expedia we learned that she LIED and it WAS up to the hotel policy.
Eventually she had me WAIT (about 30 minutes) until her son (who I guess is in charge) to come to the hotel to speak with me. He eventually agreed to refund me the second night. After checking into the Ramada across the street, I called my bank and filed a claim to regain the money they refused to refund me. I won the claim.

TL/DR: WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY HERE.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Review>This place is a joke! Booked it online and thought great the room looks nice and modern has a TV and nice updated shower. I'm writing this review while I'm still currently here this place is so bad!!

First let's start with first appearances. This place is tiny I mean probably only has 10 rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floor because the first floor is for staff. There was only 4 parking spaces! Luckily I got one but I drive a small lancer and could bailey fit "lucky I didn't bring my truck"! Checked it at 2 and went out on town well the lobby guys shift must have ended because when I got back and parked in the small spot some Indian lady literally ran into the street saying I'll tow you. I told her what room and she said there is no1 in there. She didn't even speak English! Well it all worked out. And I didn't get towed.

Second the room looked amazing online what they don't show you is how crappy the rest of the hotel is graffiti all overr the elevator going into your rooms. Nasty 1975 carpet thought the entire place. And let's talk about paper thin walls! Plus the shower looks nice, but has some slant in it and the drain doesn't work so you are standing in a pool of your dirty shower water. They have direct TV but not very many channels. Don't bother trying HBO or STARZ. The wifi is incredibly slow and took about 10 try's to connect.

Third as I said I'm writing this review while still staying here. Just woke up at 6am to banging on either my door or the door next to me I'm not sure but it was loud enough to wake me up! It was just room service at the next door! Who does room service at 6am! Plus you should know who is in your hotel! Again with paper thin walls I can here someone clapping down the hall and that dam squeaky cart that the room service people have.

Ultimately it's insulting knowing how much you are paying because one u walk into the hotel there is a nice RAMADA right next door with underground parking, gated community valets! Don't book here at any cost waist of money and time<//Review>< pictures>

I don't know what prior who have negative things to say about this place are taking about? This place is great! From the outside it may not look all that, but once you get into your room you realize that this place is a diamond in the rough. When you first arrive there is a cappuccino/hotchocolate machine for you to enjoy. The rooms were big, a huge (like 42") plasma tv, The staff is friendly, the cleaning crew obviously care about their jobs because the rooms were clean. The pillowtop matterss was amazing (felt like I was sleeping in the clouds), the showers were clean with great water pressure, hardwood floors, and the and even though check out was at 11, I woke up late and needed to shower... they let me stay till 12 without any problems or extra fees. But my favorite part that put the cherry on top of the ice cream was thevfactvthatbthey had breathe right and summers eve trial size packs for your use in the bathroom. I've been back here twice now and without fail it has been a pleasant stay. Well definitely be Back again. Don't listen to the people who say this place is  no good.<//Review>

The staff look down on you. There aren't liquid soap and enough towels, microwave is only to decorate, maybe you'll have hot water for a quick shower, what wifi?, no light bulbs and, on the top of all, they have very bad manners... An experience to forget!!< /Review>

DO NOT STAY HERE! They literally came into my room and touched and packed my personal belongings while I was away because 'check out is at 12' even though I requested and was told I could leave at 2. Staff was very rude and it should be illegal to touch your guests belongings!!</Review>

About 12 minutes walk from the subway, the following is still the first choice to Los Angeles. The disadvantage is no breakfast and parking.

The bronze Mechanics Monument was created by sculptor Douglas Tilden and dedicated in 1901.

Tilden was born in Chico, California, in 1860. At age four, he contracted scarlet fever which left him deaf and mute for life.

Tilden attended the California School for the Deaf and UC Berkeley, then he studied art in Paris.

The Mechanics Monument was commissioned to honor industrialist Peter Donahue, founder of the San Francisco & North Pacific Railroad.

The bronze depicts five men struggling to punch a hole through a metal plate with a punch press. At the base are symbols of Donahue's professions: an anvil represents foundries, a propeller represents shipping, and the driving wheel and connecting rod represent railroads.

When the monument was dedicated, many citizens were shocked by the sight of rude mechanicals cavorting in the street without their knickers. Editorials demanded that Tilden put trousers on the men, an interesting aesthetic and technical challenge. Tilden ignored the controversy and it faded away.<//Review>

This is a little area on Market in front of some office buildings. You can walk by it as you're going somewhere, then Google Maps will ask you to review it.  It's fine I guess.< /Text>

<Text>It is where people went after the 1906earthquake, there to plan what to do next. The statue in question refers to the Mechanics Movement of the ,19th Century which gave us all our builders and hands-on people. It was an international movement with Libraries and Centers in most advanced towns and cities.< /Text><Date>1562706905251<//Date><name>Arthur Crowther<//name><Pics>None<//Pics><userid>118396982988305196323<//userid></record>

< Review>
I was looking to get a good upper body workout and got exactly that. The day I went, the winds were very strong and the waves were somewhat choppy. By the time I finished, my arms and back were beat.

The SUP shop trailer is fairly easy to spot from the street, so it isn’t too hard to find. Parking lots are available near the trailer and street parking was pretty easy as well, if you don’t mind the walk. Walk in’s are welcome but I strongly suggest making reservations online when going on holidays or weekends.

Everyone at the shop was very friendly and super helpful. Ryan and his coworker were kind enough to share some sunscreen with us, and they even have a nice shoe/sandal rack so that you don’t have to leave them on the beach. For the beginners in our group, they gave everyone a quick tutorial to get things going, and even helped bring the boards out into the water for those who had trouble.

Their equipment was overall well maintained and other than the loose rubber on my paddle board, I had no issues. The kayaks even looked like they had back rests! Rentals run about $30 an hour.

Love the views, great service and a fun activity to do while in the area. Had a wonderful experience at Mothers Beach, thanks Pro Sup Shop!< /Review>

<Review>Great team build experience! We just had our team build event at Pro SUP and it was a great experience. It was seamless to book paddle boards online for the team (10 of us), and when I called in to change a few paddle board rentals to kayak rentals they were accommodating. Upon arrival, sign up was seamless and everyone had a great time on the water. Highly recommend for a group. Book online!</Review>< pictures>

Pro SUP makes standup paddle boarding SO effortless. They are located right on the water for an easy departure. The staff gives you a quick overview on technique and is waiting for you upon your return. Super friendly staff. We've taken two work groups out and Pro SUP makes it extremely enjoyable. They are the best.</review>

Made reservations online, waited in line to get checked in, told him our names, and we were good to go.

From the moment we got to the location this whole team was just so friendly and accommodating! They were all smiles and it was only about 2 minutes from checking in to getting down to our kayaks and taking off.  The location is stunning with all the boats at the marina. There's even a little beach area to hang out after returning your gear.  The only down side is paying for parking but that's common around here anyway.  We had an amazing time and will definitely come back!<//text>

I love this place!!  The owners are so nice and helpful. We take our nephews a few times a year. The boys love the paddle boards, and we’re generally in a nearby double kayak in case they need to take a break or grab a quick snack. Such a lovely way to spend time with family!!<//Review>

I would highly recommend Pro sup shop :) My husband and I had to reschedule due to him being sick and Joy, one of the staffers, was accommodating and kind. The day of, they were organized, the kayaks+paddles were in good shape, and the staff seemed very fun, helpful, and easy to talk to! I'm a local but can see this activity being great for out-of- towners and locals alike.<//Review>

My family of 3 booked a 2-hour intro lesson with Cole and absolutely loved it! My daughter is 10 and having him there as we worked on gaining confidence without worrying about her safety was HUGE. He was patient with her and had a great vibe about him, which made the whole experience super pleasant for the three of us. Learned lots of tips about technique as well as getting around the marina itself. The whole staff was great as well, and I highly recommend Pro SUP Shop!</Review>

Just get fitted for your life jacket and pole and go on down to the water's edge for your stand up paddleboard and a quick lesson from staff if you need it. Equipment is safe and sturdy. Life jackets available for all sizes and dogs too! We had a blast. I was surprised that the water was not too cold in October, November and March. Will definitely come again.<//Review>< pics>

Such a great experience! 4 of us decided to try out paddle boarding for my birthday. Stephen set us up, showed us the proper way to paddle board, then set us free into the Marina. If you're looking for a fun, easy activity for any adventure level, do this. Friendliest staff and the sea lions  were an added bonus.<//Review>

Booked my kayaking trip the night before for me and two friends--was super glad that it was an easy process. Prices seemed reasonable and was just what we were looking for! Saw some sea lions too... :)</Review>

<Text>100% Professionals.  The best, also they are the original SUP shop on Mothers Beach and are all about having a safe and fun experience. For all levels from beginners on up. They are connected with the top board shapers and paddle makers in the business and have the knowledge to help you elevate your abilities in the sport. I'm grateful to their whole crew, its become one of my favorite sports, the workout is incredible and hanging out with seals and sea-loins never gets old.</Text><username>Mitchell Lucas</username><user>113488069189166609977</user></record>

It’s always a Good experience, the Pro SUP guys are professional, and kind. They help you choose the safe board or a fast board, and give you useful technique tips, great tips.
And if you just want to go out there and take selfies, that’s cool too. Love them all.<//Text>

Rented 2 kayaks for 1 hour. They said they offered $5 off each rental for local pricing (we live steps away). The male taking payments only gave us $5 off total. No biggie....I didn't mention it. Another male gives us our paddles, takes us to our kayaks, and gets us on our way. After we've been out on the water for a bit, we realize we have no idea what time we started. We head back, and the same male who helped us get into the water, helped us out. Except this time, he was too busy flirting with the female employee (who did absolutely nothing except say "Have a great day!"). He was too distracted to be of any assistance otherwise. We take our paddles back to the shop. Only then did we realize we had only been on the water for 30 min. I told them nobody told us what time we started, which is why we came back. They basically shrugged their should and said "Oh, that's too bad." The guy getting us into the water could have said something to the extent of "Alright, it's 2:00pm. See you in an hour!" This place is nothing but a tourist attraction. They don't care about the locals. Definitely won't be renting from them, nor referring friends and family to their business.<//Text>

Rented a tandem kayak online an hour ahead of time (awesome). Check in was super easy and COVID safe - we grabbed our kayak by the water and were on our way within minutes. Staff was super friendly as well :) They even let us start 10 minutes before our reserved time. We will definitely be back, thank you!</Text>

My kids and I had a great time kayaking today at Mother’s Beach in Marina Del Rey. Pro SUP Shop was very organized on how they assist customers. We will be back for sure!</review>

<Date>1618206261429<//Date><Text>I've been SUPing for over a decade and these guys are by far the best.  Local knowledge, kind, friendly and experienced.
Today was the first time I took my 7 year old on a board, we rented from ProSup so I didn't have to lug my 12 footer all the way to Mother's beach.  It was so easy, the Pro team was so friendly and helpful that my little man jumped right on and paddled away on his first try.  Point is he wasn't nervous because everyone was so encouraging and fun.
Thank you ProSup. We'll be back soon!~
PS- we also rented a Kayak for an hour and strode around the channel, saw a harbor seal and enjoyed a great day in the water.
xo
much love to the ProSup shop~< /Text>< userid>

<Review>Unbelievable people and service, they lent me two paddles after we somehow forgot our paddles in SD. They saved the weekend for us and we can’t thank them enough. I called every shop in the area and even the other shops said my best bet was the Pro SUP Shop. They were right. Mike and team took amazing care of us and we will for sure rent from them when we return with the rest of the family.

If you are looking for the spot to rent quality gear, they have it but the customer service is even better.<//Review><user_id>116762555017208214005< /user_id></record>

<text>Excellent experience at a great location. Very easy to rent and plenty of nearby parking just adjacent to Marina Del Rey.  Lots of channels you can cruise down. Along the way you may encounter a seal or two as well as a few sea lions sunning on the back of someone's boat. Just keep paddling and enjoy the cool Pacific breeze. The staff is enthused and ready to assist whether you're experienced or need lessons. I had a great time. Swing by and check them out. It's a very cool LA experience.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQPpw_QNO5NtbJ2QLk4bZbi72lEjzndtS3AmHN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

I can’t say enough about how wonderful this team is. Mike and Mike are responsive, reliable, generous, smart and go out of their way to make sure your experience is terrific.

<text>Pro SUP was very accommodating, had competitive rates, and were super responsive when I called with questions. My friend and I rented paddle boards there for an hour and were really happy with the service and quality of the gear. They are set up right next to the beach and have an area where you can leave your shoes and belongings while you paddle. My friend had never paddled before and one of the employees was able to give her a quick rundown on what to do. The waters of the marina are very calm which makes it an idea place to learn for first-timers. We also went on a Sunday which meant we were able to park for free on the street by the marina where the curbs were painted yellow.<//text>< user_id>

<Text>I came around 10:00 am on Sunday.  They open at 9:00 am.  All kayaks were already taken.  I was told they can put me on the waiting list and that I will get the first kayak available since I am first on the list.  They asked for my phone number and said they will call me in 40 -60 minutes when the kayak is available.  I took a walk and they NEVER called me back. I ended up renting at Marina Boat Rentals, where I didn't have to wait  and the price was cheaper: 90 minutes rental was the same price as 60 minutes at Pro SUP Shop.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_id>

<name>Margaret Vyas< /name><time>1594756942071<//time><Rating>1< /Rating><review>Ok honestly I expected a lot better. My friend goes there every weekend and does paddle boarding and she loves it. Ok so the first complaint is a biggie, but it dosnt apply to most people. So I’m not an adult. They have an age limit of 13 yrs. See I was put into school young so all the people in my grade, and all my friends are 13 and 14, but I’m 12. You can see the first problem cause I wasn’t even aloud to go paddle boarding with my friend who we had planned to have fun with. Embarrassing right? And it was all cause of my age when I had the same amount of responsibility and knolage as them I was just slightly younger. Another comlaint is that they did not follow corona guidelines. Although you will see countless great reviews about their safety procoshians, that was not my experience. Firstly a guys that worked there spit into one of the kiyaks. Furthermore they don’t wipe down the equipment often. Lastly there are stingrays. Even in the area that is supposed to be safe for swimming I say at least three. O and people have gotten stung. If u fall off your paddle board or your kiyak tips over its to the hospital. Honestly I hope many people see this review and it dosnt get taken down because I need people to realize that this is overrated. If u read all the way make sure to wash your hands and where a mask</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1594932082953, 'text': "Hi Margaret, I'm so sorry your experience wasn't up to par!!

<review>Very friendly and helpful staff! My best friend and I arrived 30 minutes early for our booking and we were having trouble finding the location of Pro SUP. We called them and they led us in the right direction and found them shortly after. My friend had made a reservation for the tandem kayak, but the other person she was going on it with couldn't make it so they hooked her up with a single passenger kayak and offered us a voucher for the difference in payment (tandem was 35, single is 25). The two young ladies then took us to the shore and kindly demonstrated proper form and technique for both the stand up paddle board and kayak. We went out and had a great time!! Very nice marina, beautiful day, and unforgettable time. Thanks!<//review><user>113243908524382436507<//user><time>1528051532508</time><username>Arianna Orlando</username>< pics>

Fiendly staff and excellent service!!
They rent single Kayaks (25$/hour), double kayaks (35$/hour) and stand up paddle boards (25$/hour). They are located at mother's beach (the location in google maps is pretty accurate). Although paddling is pretty easy and doesn't need much experience, if it's your first time they will give you an introduction on how to paddle before getting into the water.
If you wish to paddle in marina del ray area this place is highly recommended.<//text>

JJ hooked us up with some sites to see along the paddle board trip and some water afterwards. Super nice guy all about having fun, gave us some good site seeing suggestions around the area that turned out to be pretty cool. Ask him about his mini coup.<//Review>

Pro Sup Shop is based out of the best place in LA to Stand Up Paddle Board, Mother Beach , Marina del Ray. The waters are calm there boards are new, light weight and fast. At Pro Sup Shop you can rent SUP boards, Kayaks, buy  SUP boards and get and amazing lesson. They are based out of the most beautiful hotels in Marina del Ray, The Jamaica Bay Inn. There is a restaurant at there location called the Beach Side Cafe. It's delicious try the Hummus, $7 Fish Tacos,  Seared Ahi Salad. The HAPPY HOUR is always 2 for 1. This all really comes in handy after a long paddle though the Marina. Last time i went out I saw Dolphins in the Marina. I give PRO SUP SHOP Two Thumbs way up high!!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>Going to pro sub shop was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made. Not only did I learn how to stand up paddleboard, but using it in my surfing has increased my fun factor more than 100%. Additionally,  there is such a strong great group of people there, we ended up becoming a bunch of great friends, and have been on many amazing journeys together. From 15 miles around Palos Verdes, too many trips deep in the northern Malibu.
This is a great place to learn how to become an excellent stand up paddle boarder with all the tips and tricks, from seasoned pros who teach from experience.</review>< Resp>

I SUP on the central coast of Cali. I've learned everything I know about the sport from ProSUP. The location is hands down easy and accessible to all. The team is professional and will give you the time and equipment needed to enjoy this sport, if you enjoy the rental, you can make a purchase to own right there. I love my Riviera board and quickblade paddle. Going out on the moonlight paddle is a favorite activity for me and my 7 year old daughter. The ProSUP team meets everyone for the group paddle, no one is left behind! We highly recommend ProSUP to all our friends and family.<//Text>

< review>
Had a great time at out on the bay this morning. I thought padding in the Marina with all the boats would make the experience crowded and a bit dangerous. However, I found it strangely comforting and connecting with the others engaging in water activities (kayaking, sailing, boat tours). For the most part the water was smooth with occasional turbulence calls cause by passing boats. Over all very pleasant experience. I will caution to pay attention the return trip, easy to confuse the right boat path.</review>

<Review>This place is incredible!!! They do everything they can to cut you the best deal and are VERY FRIENDLY!! Jesus is extremely skilled at customer service and made me feel valued from the moment I walked in the door.

Highly recommend this place to anyone who distrusts larger chain stores!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I bought tires here and had them change two of my wheels for me in January 2020. The prices and the customer service from Jesus was outstanding. I had a slow leak on one of my tires today and Jesus took a nail out of it and plugged up the hole very fast. I will be going here for all my tire needs from now on!< /text>< response>

I will give Mr. Romero all my future tire business and strongly recommend his tire shop. I was quoted over the phone and the shop delivered on what was quoted. Very satisfied customer.<//Text>

Price is very fair. Service is quick and excellent. The guy seemed to be the owner was very polite.
My wife actually recommended to me, so it my turn to recommend this place to someone.
Will return when needed.<//text>

They were recommended by my mechanic. Got a good deal after giving me several choices and quotes.  They ordered the tires i wanted and had them the next morning and mounted them while I waited. Fast. Friendly.

Addendum:  it’s been 3 1/2 years since I purchased these tires and they have preformed excellently.  They still have years of wear left on them. Very happy.<//Review>

Wonderful place,so happy I went there. They were very helpful fast and went above and beyond my expectations! I had no idea where to go to fix my bent rim,also had broken the band on my hubcap my car is only 5 mos. old and I had been told I needed a new rim. They straightened out my rim and put a new band on my hubcap balanced my tire too for 10.00. I am in LOVE with my car again and will be more careful.</text>

Not only was he able to take a big dent out of my rim(the other place said i need to spend 150.00 on a new one, but i was in and out of there in about ten minutes at the cost of a mere 25.00! They also checked to make sure it was safe to drive on the rim and checked all my other tires, so very satisfied with these guys and now they have a new customer!!< /Text>< Pics>

When you find an honest as hell mechanic. Prepaid for some tires, he made an honest mistake on the tire size, upgrades me at no extra cost after I was already going to review him well based on his courtesy and original price point. Then this?!

Jesus and Jr are just afdable and appear to be having the times of their lives and it shows in their kindness, price points, and sense of service.</review>

< review>
I only post reviews when extremely impressed or disappointed. Unfortunately, despite the great reviews that led me to choose Buy Any Tires Depot (BATD) and feeling good about 4 used tires for $300, I now describe how it played out over the past 4 months.

The Manager, Jesus, is a jovial guy who seems honest and helpful. But after 3 months, when my van began to shudder at 65mph+, I sought multiple opinions. Two other tire shop techs said the tires were out of balance, needed alignment, etc. and also said these tires were weather cracked and unsafe (though I suspected their opinion was biased). I spoke to Jesus (BATD) about it and he promptly spoke negatively about other tire shops as if his opinion is unbiased/reliable and others are not. He stated the tires did show some weather-wear but that most tires do in SoCal and that these were "good tires" with another year left on them. I asked him to re-balance the tires (so he did) but stated they were already balanced well. The shudder at 65mph+ continued.

Soon after, my father-in-law, a 40 year mechanic, was in town  and detected the preliminary stages of tread separation. He stated that this happens when used tires are mistakenly mounted in the opposite direction they were previously spinning. This can cause the tire to shred apart incurring immediate danger and damage to the vehicle. He suggested replacing the tires as soon as possible. Since my father-in-law has nothing at stake except my family's safety I value his opinion.

I then inquired with Jesus about new tires for my other vehicle to hear his views regarding used vs. new. He said he puts new tires on all his cars. I’d done extensive research on new tires so was unimpressed when he recommended poorly reviewed tires. I asked why he recommends low quality tires. He said he puts on new, cheap tires every two years and replaces them when they wear out. I'm not interested in this practice. So I bought 4 new tires; 2 at American Tire Depot and 2 at Redlands Tire Pros.  They gave me the same price, though RTP did not charge me for the rear alignment because they said it passed. (Kudos to them - they could've hidden that info and charged me anyway.) The shudder vanished.

So I returned to BATD. Jesus was less smiley than usual when he saw 4 new tires on my van. I pulled the 4 used tires out of my van and said I was returning them because the tread was separating. His response was that they were “bad tires” from American Tire Depot. I said, "No, I bought these used from you when you said they were a good tire." His response was that this was American Tire Depot's in-house tire that was known to cause problems. I resolved to write this review. I'd purchased those tires after Jesus recommended them over a cheaper used tire he had in his shop. My $300 got me 4 months and a lot of verbal smoke and mirrors. I do NOT trust BATD and believe they will say and do anything to convince you they are  honest and giving you the best deal in town. They lost my business by refusing to offer any kind of refund on “bad tires” they recommended and installed incorrectly. They also lost it by criticizing others rather than taking responsibility for their actions.

SIDENOTE: The same week I bought these 4 used tires from BATD, they rotated the tires on my Mazda 3 but within the first mile I noticed a tremendously loud humming. I drove back to BATD. Jesus said it was just a groove on the tires and that after 100-300 miles it'd smooth out. I left the next day, drove to San Jose and back the day after; 800 miles. The hum never dissipated. When arriving back home, I went to BATD to resolve the issue. Jesus said the rear shocks were bad, were causing “cupping” on the tires and it all needed to be replaced. This turned out to be true and I wondered why he didn’t tell me this in the first place.

BOTTOM LINE: If a reviewer is initially happy due saving money, so was I. But time has revealed that BATD let me down on multiple levels in 2 different vehicle situations. Initially happy … eventually disappointed … and out $300 which BATD is shrugging off.< /review>

Quite pleased with today’s visit.   Wait time from check in to having dentist start work, was minimal.  Dentist himself was personable, professional and gentle.  I would recommend this dentist to everyone.<//Text>

Every visit is always a great one with no hassle ! Typically, I’m afraid of dental offices but I feel very comfortable getting work done here. Mary always makes the experience easy for me and ensures I’m taken care of with every visit. Thank you guys !< /Review>

I have been going to this office for several years, my insurance changed in Sept.2020, I gave the girl at the counter my new card, she said that I would have to pay $100.00 before I was seen, I told her I should not have to pay anything according to my insurance, They refused to see me unless I payed so I went ahead and payed and called my Insurance when I got home.  I was correct I shouldn't have payed nothing.  I called the office and spoke to there office manager (Tracie) who was extremely Rude!!! and said she would look into the matter. I called back at least 5 times before getting in contact with her again, she said that it would take her at least 6 months to audit the account. (It had already been 3-monts since I had paid) I called her 3months later to check the status, it took about 3 phone calls to finally get to her, she said they didn't owe me anything, that over the years the office girls had made mistakes on my account and I should have paid more than what I did. (I paid my account in full every time I went to the office) I told her that I want to see the paper work to get it ready and I would pick it up the next day.  I went to the office the next day, I called in advance to tell her when I would be there, She made me wait for the paperwork for over an hour.  I was so upset!!!  She was so RUDE!!!  I went home I called my Insurance and they have NEVER!! received a bill at all for anything from this office. Also, I had filed several complaints with Western Dentals corp. office and they never responded and never followed up(according to the girls who took the complaints at the corp. office) So that tells me that They just don't care about there patients, and  I'm wondering if something cricked is going on with the billing since my Insurance NEVER received any billing for several years,  I did file a complaint with the " Better Business Bureau" to help me get my money back, if not I will file a small claims case with the Courts.
This message is to Tracie, you should be ashamed!! of your self on how you treat people, there was 2 other people in the office at the same time as me, the man said he had been waiting over 2 hours for you and the women said that she had to put her credit card company on you.  So I'm not the only one complaining about you.. Hopefully the Corp. will get enough complaints on you and you will no longer have a job and it will teach you a lesson on how to treat people with respect like they deserve!!!
You won't be doing it to me anymore I have already changed my Dentist.<//review>

WOW!!! Tinisha Neal, our Dental Hygienist, was outstanding in her thorough, completely professional attention to both my spouse's and my teeth.
She put each of us at ease in her engaging conversation, relating to us in different ways as we realized talking about our relaxed experiences in her care. She was pro-active with each of our special needs, even praising my spouse for his nice gums, and me for keeping my inter-dental spacing so tight. We look forward to our next visit with Tinisha!!!<//text>

If I could give this place a rate of zero I would I had scheduled 2 appointments and an hour before the appointments they cancel due to over scheduling which I also had to call off from work. They also charge my husband for a service he never got done and he refuses to pay and now he's fighting a collection agency.< /text>

I went here earlier this year for a tooth infection and extraction and there was absolutely nothing friendly about this staff. Even with an appointment I think I waited for an hour or 2 while on the dentist chair and no one would say anything to me, they just kept passing by me without saying anything and having conversations with other staff. Dentist was done with my dental work and didn't even explain to me how to take care of my extraction. All they did was give me a baggy wth gauze and a little note on how to take care of it. Pretty much just finished and left without saying anything to me. I don't reccomend this place to anyone. Very unfriendly and unprofessional.</text>

<userid>109308503667361529166<//userid><text>First time customer and last time. I made an appointment at 4:45pm and I get there and they say we do not take new patients at this time. When I called I told them it was my first time and I would like to build a relationship with this office but this is so bad. I got out of work early to get this done and they fail me. After dealing with crazy times I can not believe a company will be that selfish to not help a customer out. They must be such a good business that they do not need the customers. I was recommended by friends and family but maybe it was this location that has people that do not care to go the extra mile.<//text>< rating>

<Date>1609290055646< /Date><Pics>None<//Pics><Review>I would give no stars, however the new hygienist was very awesome, kind and communicated to me in an effective manner. Everyone else lacks communication, or misinforms patients or doesn't provide complete information. Had an issue relating to information I was given regarding extractions for braces. I just wanted clear and concise information. I made my complaint with the office manager. Office manager said she would give a follow-up call after gathering more information from her doctors by Tuesday 12/15 (4 days after a scheduled appointment where I was at for about 2 hours and no services rendered.) It's already 12/29 and to this date I have NOT received a follow-up call from the office manager on the information I need to proceed with my treatment. I did however receive a call from corporate to schedule an appointment for "pending treatment." I told the phone rep about the issue. Sadly, she hung up the phone on me (no I was not being rude.) It seems like no one at this business has phone etiquette, and has problems with communications skills. I as a business owner disapprove and reprove this level of service. I'm taking my business to another dental/ortho clinic. The level of service here is preposterous. Not to mention, their level of service has made me feel now like an unwanted and just another patient on their charts. They benefited from my $$ and now I'm taking my $$ elsewhere. Don't forget, the patient [customer] signs your paycheck.< /Review><username>Moises Salazar</username><Rating>1< /Rating>< Resp>

I like Western Dental because we can get Saturday appointments. Plus we’ve never waited more than five minutes in the lobby, they’re quick and efficient, which I appreciate. The staff is always courteous and professional as well.<//Text>

I would like to have known what I was waiting for!?!? I was taken into one of the exam chairs and had pictures of my teeth taken,  then the technician walked out!! Didn't say anything! I sat there for approximately 20 minutes and then another person came in and took x-rays.  After which I sat about another 20 minutes then was taken to another room where a Dr. came and checked various things with my teeth.  She then told me that I needed to have a tooth extraction and that the surgeon would be in tomorrow.  Said she would check the schedule and let me know what time I could get the extraction done.  Then the financial lady comes in and explains that the doctor feels I need to have a bone transplant along with the extraction.
She said it would be over $1,000. for the procedure and would I be able to make the first payment tomorrow when I came back for the extraction. No way I could afford the procedure but no other options if I wanted to be "safely" treated.
Would have liked to have heard about the recommendation from the doctor before having to go over the "financial" options!! Was blindsided by the financial situation before knowing what the complete treatment process was explained!!</Review>

First time my daughter ever had a cavity filled. I was nervous for her. She was nervous as well. They said because of covid I couldnt be in the room with her while they were filling the cavities. But they saw I was uncomfortable with leaving her with it being her first time and so they let me sit right outside the door and watch from there so my child and I would both be comfortable. The doctor was great with my daughter and it literally only took them 5 mins to fix 2 cavities my daughter had. Greatest dental experience ever.< /Text>

<text>My children did a X-ray a month ago in another office. I brought this X-ray to this office, but they refused to accept it. They forced to make a new one. Xray is radiation exposure. It’s small, but still this is radiation. I said that I did not want additional radiation for children, but then this office refused and did unnecessary radiation. And you cannot complain or sue, because they are forced to sign a bunch of papers so that nobody can sue them.<//text>< date>

They said they could not render services at this time and additionally they had people waiting to be seen that had been waiting for an hour.   They offeered to reschedule to a different and I refused to reschedule. Had they informed me that beforehand that they would not render services I would have left. Instead they had me waste 45 minutes of my time making changes over the phone only to be told I wouldn't be seen.

<text>If I could give 0 stars I would. This place is HORRIBLE. from the first phone call to the end of the appointment. We had an emergency appointment scheduled for 2 PM call and weren’t seen until 4:45 PM. To take x-rays and sit for over 2 1/2 hours is absolutely ridiculous. I completely understand with all of the  COVID-19 protocols it can be hectic but to not even say a word to us as we wait is absurd. Never coming here again.</text><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

<review>When I called Western Dental in Hemet, I asked to be a new patient of Dr. Sophia Cadet. I don't know who examined me today, but he didn't even offer to do a regular dental cleaning. All he did was try to sell me an expensive proprietary gum treatment that isn't covered by insurance. Not a great approach to a new customer relationship.<//review>< Gmap_id>

They are more worried about the quantity versus the quality   . My appointment was at 315 wasn’t taken back until 430 and they tried to reschedule the cleaning because it was going to be a longer wait this was at 540. They close at 6 so I’m guessing they were trying to leave. They “cleaned” the teeth but didn’t floss and didn’t apply the fluoride which is included with a cleaning.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>TERRIBLE SERVICE.   Calls not returned.  RX written on other doctors pads. Basically called a liar when I told them pharmacy would not fill rx.  this is antibiotics.  Its been 2days on the phone with them to try to get them to call drug store. I was told to take my son to EMERGENCY room if it got too bad. Excuse me it was an EMERGENCY appointment on Saturday, tis is Wednesday still no medication.  Right now he is looking for another DDS and I am filling out a complaint for the state dental board.  If you think a mouth infection is minor go there, however, if you consider it serious go anywhere else.</Text>< Pictures>

Best to drive to another office the finance chick is super rude and doesn't know how to listen. Rialto office A+ for customer service and dental services. If you paid with a card double check they don't take additional funds or deposit less than the refund stated. The wait is very very long. Arrived at 11 for x-rays left after 3.

Rude staff and never prompt on appointment times. Routinely have you waiting 30 minutes to an hour before being seated and they treat you rude when you ask about the delay. The male dentist and his assistant are the only reason I go back</text>

<review>Great office. Long wait times. I come here very quite often for general dentistry as well as orthodontist appointments. I always arrive 15 minutes prior to my appointment time and I’m never seen until about 30-60 minutes later. Great offices, I love their work they just take forever. Even after you get a room, you still want another 15 - 20 minutes for the dentist to come to you.< /review>< Pics>

Went in for a consult and was so impressed by all the staff and the doctor. Super knowledgable, good bedside manner, and trust-worthy. Aimee takes customer care on a whole other level -- everything from educating you on the process of orthodontics as well as providing great concierge, making sure you're comfortable and happy. She also breaks down the process - from the procedure to payment plan. Now on to the doctor. Dr. is such a pleasant person to be around and very straightforward with a great positive attitude and providing a plan is very comforting. I've been to other orthodontics offices that felt like a factory - in and out - but this place, you feel the people give you the right personal attention, and family care. Highly highly recommend!< /review>

First thing I look for when I go into any office is great “Customer Service” Aimee at the front office was a perfect example of customer service. In fact, we decided to come back because of her smile and good nature. Of course the Dr. and assistants in the the back office were all great too... looking forward to our treatments here at Western Dental!< /text>

My experience with western dental has been absolutely above and beyond amazing. I have taken my daughter to several different dentists in which exasterbated her anxiety and when we came to western dental the staff and the dentist were so calm and gentle and caring with my daughter they eased her anxiety and they explained everything to her as they did it as we as to her dad and myself they made all of us feel very comfortable and just made the whole experience a very easy transition for my daughter. Now we wont go to any other dentist for our dental needs.<//review>

<review>Arrived at the hemet branch of Western Dental to a very unfriendly female staff member who worked the front desk. She advised me after she took my co payment that your appointment was a mistake. We have to bring you back  at the end of August.  I took the day off from work to attend to this appointment time. The female clerk in the front had the worst attitude from the second  I walked in.  Very disappointed to how I was  treated at the  hemet location of Western Dental.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>I waited for almost an hour to get checked, & as soon as the doctor came in that was all he said, was that I was in need of braces because I had a big bite & so forth. I mean I understand that I couldn’t afford the first payment to start off with everything but a good act of kindness would be great. & they seem to look down on me🤷‍♀️<//Text>< time>

Professional and very open environment, Curtis was super cool and helpful with all my concerns and knew how to speak my language it was like coming to hangout with a friend. Yoli went over my finances and she broke it down step by step. I’m definitely coming back for all future check ups and asking if there in the office. They felt honest and no one seemed like being at work was a burden.<//Review>

<username>Caressa V< /username><pics>None< /pics><Text>I am giving it 4 starts. Aimee on the orthodontist side is always polite, very kind and always professional. But the other ladies on the dentist side can be rude, impatient and unprofessional. Take lessons from Aimee ladies.
They are busy and one time I got impatient because I waited almost 2 hours for 2 of my kids to be seen. Honestly that wasnt what bother me it was the fact that the receptionist on the dentist side didnt see how we were doing or apologize for the long wait....you know customer service. The manger, however, apologized and that made it easy to forgive their rudennss. It life and were all human.

Now I want to give it 1 starts for how they are handling covid19. I have a kid with braces and needs assistance. I have been on the phone today with their call service 4/28/2020 on hold  for an 1 hour!!! No emails or phone calls to check on the kids with braces? This bothers me. And no excuse before they closed I made sure they had my correct information.

They are essential I'm shocked they are shut down completely.

Well rant over.< /Text>< GmapID>

<text>Amazing staff and informative with everything! They treat you so well and in a timely manner. They tended to my teeths needs and explained what needed to be done so that'd I understand. All in all. A very good dental office.

I returned for fillings and my experience was a good one. Even through the pain. They did what they could to ease it. And I appreciate their service tremendously. 😊< /text>< pictures>

Aimee in orthodontics is awesome! She is so honest and so helpful. I thank God that He led us to come into Western Dental especially after all of the horrible experiences we have had at other dental facilities like Hospitality Dental and Bright Now Dental. We brought our kids in for orthodontics but after this experience, Western Dental is our new dentist! Love this place, love the staff. This Western Dental is clean, reasonable, and very friendly! Thank you Aimee and rest of the staff!<//Text>

Aimee is the best, my family just loves her. Customer service is her first name. If anyone is in the market for braces come to Western Dental in Hemet and talk to Aimee she will definitely give you the best quote and explain to you everything you need to know to get stareted.
Thanks again Aimee< /Review>

Extremely long wait times. They had an issue with my insurance (which could have been solved if they contacted my insurance prior to my assigned appointment) that took about an hour. Then another hour to wait in lobby. Than another hour waiting for dentist. Almost an entire day wasted by Western Dental. Get your stuff together.<//Text>

When we were told my daughter needed braces our first choice was Western Dental. My husband used them before and was very happy with the payment options they offer. As expected, we got a great payment plan, thanks to Aimee from ortho. Aimee is exceptional, she is always  friendly and extremely helpful. From day one she has treated my family with kindness and respect. She always greets us with a smile, answers our questions, and makes us feel welcomed. If you want great friendly service come to WD Hemet :)<//text>

<text>Extremely slow service. Consistently takes 3 hours to get seen, even when arriving early for our appointments, every, single, time. People in the waiting room are always upset about the wait, and people are always walking out from the back saying they can no longer wait on the staff. Simple things like getting a prescription took an hour of just sitting in the back waiting. Really? These people drag there feet every single day, and this is after coming for several visits with the same experience. Poor service.< /text>< Resp>

the staff "seemed nice"??  but the waiting is just long. disregard your appointment time, you can get in after an hour and a half or nearly two hours from your supposedly appointment time. you have to save the whole day for your dental cares alone if you go here. if you can get to a different dental clinics, try them out first. the funny thing is that they have a lot of stuff. it is a test of patience, if you don't have other important things to do.< /text>

<Text>If I could give five 0s I would. I came on the 26th to get my wisdom teeth removed and a day after I feel sharp stabbing on the side of my cheek. Turns out there’s bone left over. A large piece! I can’t talk or eat without gauze in my mouth and even that doesn’t help much. I am back today (in the office at the moment) I show them the picture of it and they said they were gonna look to make sure. They took xrays and said there’s nothing there. I said how can you say that when I can’t talk to you without the gauze. So she looks in and tells me that I’m right and I can see if I’m a week if it gets better. No ma’am we are taking this out today. I’ve been here since 2pm it is now 4:20 and I haven’t gotten them removed yet. I’m still waiting.</Text>< Name>

<Name>Tasha Lewis< /Name>< Review>
My filling came out on Monday 11/25/19, I called up Western Dental in Hemet, because my tooth was hurting. I made sure I told the lady that booked my appointment that my tooth was hurting. She made me appointment for Wednesday 11/27/19 @3pm. I came in and got my x-rays and was told the doctor would be in. At 3:45pm one of the tech came in and told me, we seen our last patient at 3pm and we are closing at 4pm. So we’ll have to reschedule you for Friday, and we can’t do an exam. I told them well I should of been informed cause I could of took my self to another dentist. Because of the pain I was in my blood pressure was high. The doctor came in and asked me what I was allergic to and I told her. She said take over the counter Tylenol. I told her thats what I’ve been taken and it wasn’t working, she said because it’s open and it needs to be filled and left the room. And left me in pain and I had to spend my Thanksgiving in pain. They could of told me they was closing early and I could of went to another dentist or even told me when I checked in so I could of did a walk in somewhere else. They didn’t tell me anything until 15 minutes to closing so I had no time to call! And this was unprofessional and so wrong. So I went into my appointment this morning, and the dentist she was Asian came in and ask me how my Thanksgiving I told her it wasn’t good cause I was in pain. She responded did I brake your tooth, I said no! But I came in on Wednesday, she reply’s yeah but you came in late! I said no I came in at my appointment time. And if you guys where closing early you should of called us and told us. So then the other dentist came in tried to numb my tooth and she couldn’t, the nerve was to unhappy. So she put in a temporary filling until I come back. But she was going to give me antibiotics and pain meds because I was going to have pain after the pain wears off. So she went to ask the Asian nurse to write me a prescription for Pain meds. Well the Asian dentist told her that I didn’t need any because you covered the nerve. And let me go. My mom had to take me to Urgent care because I was in so much pain when the numbness wearied off. My blood pressure was 169/108. And they wrote me a prescription....Your add said we make patient smile, well that’s not true cause I’m very up set and won’t do anymore business nor will I refer anyone to this office in Hemet, CA.</Review>

<rate>4<//rate><Text>Overall, my experience has been positive. I like that there are Saturday appointments available and that the customer service from the receptionists is top-notch. Sometimes there can be a little bit of long wait but it’s  understandable considering they attract many clients. I would recommend making an appointment and checking in 10 minutes before your appointment time. The orthodontist and his staff are excellent. Amee is an amazing receptionist and has really great customer service and is very positive and friendly. Dr. Bui and his assistant Miguel are both very helpful and nice with their expertise.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

So as you may know a lot of people are afraid to go to the dentist. Probably because they may be embarrassed of the condition of their teeth or just plain just terrified of thought of getting a tooth pulled. Well at western dental I felt neither,  the staff where polite, helpful and also comforting. Western dental was the first dental office were I felt comfortable to get my teeth worked on. There were two dental assistants that I felt as though made me more comfortable being at the dental office , who was Robbie and Julie. I want to thank western dental for giving me a great experience and just overall get service</text>

Marissa who did xrays on my daughter as not welcoming at all! Your dealing with a child, you try to make them feel comfortable!!

And... Eva *you are rude! And too aggressive!! You dont push down the hose down the side of an open mouth!! Seems like she didn't like working with kids!!

Hate that it's the only western dental here, I have felt with western dental in national city and really miss them!! If I have to drive down there, I will!!!

Poor management,very over loaded with patients  wait times are around 2 to 1/2 hrs just to get in a room for xrays. There after it's about another 45 to an hr wait this is for the pediatric and general.seems they are so over loaded and dont have the staff to handle patients. Orthodontist are great and flexible with appointments and wait times no issue there.recommendations find another dental office< /Review>

Once we got to the back the staff were wayyy more friendly than the front desk clerk that I first spoke with.  I would of liked for them to take more time on the actual cleaning and additional work that was done because it seemed as though they rushed through it. After leaving my husband called me and told me that they called him to reschedule my sons missed appointment which was ridiculous because obviously he was there and recieved treatment. I will redo my review after the next visit overall..

Negatives:

FRONT DESK: Seemed as though they are always disconnected from what is going on in the office and unfriendly.

WAIT TIME: About 1 hour after expected appointment time

<text>This was my four year old’s first dental work and couldn’t be happier with the staff and Dr. they were patient and explained everything to me. Igor to watch all the work get done and though my son cried he was back to himself within an hour of the procedure. Worth the 2 hr wait. So just be ready to have patience.</text>< username>

<text>My daughter is in pain so I called Western Dental for an appointment look at her teeth . They scheduled me for the next day which was wonderful i did not have a copy of her insurance card but they told me that was fine to just let them know her ss number and take my I'd since they already had her insurance on file but to be sure I had my I'd or they would turn me and her away. I grabbed my tax forms just in case they needed more than just me saying the number. They would not see my little girl because she didn't have the actual card with the number on it. They told me tpjust reschedule because they weren't going to help her whether she was in pain or not. Chose a different dentist!!!!!< /text><Time>1547678558948< /Time>< Pictures>

<Review>The last two times I have been here it has been difficult 3 hour visits each time for things that shouldnt take so long. Just today I went in for just two fillings thats it no cleaning no x rays just fillings. She kept on messing up had to redo the fillings 2 or 3 times. I pray to god that its not always going to be like this. I have another appointment on Thursday if this happens again I might just have to look for another dentist even if i have to pay out of pocket at this rate I wish I had because it seems like you get treated differently when you have medical. Also hoping I didnt get scammed into buying this kit that was like $1400 because they said I needed it. Might just need to return it.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

MY FRIEND WAS FORCED TO HAVE A TOOTH EXTRACTED BECAUSE ONE OF THE DENTIST DRILLED THE TOOTH TILL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO FILL AND RECROWN  .THE FLOORS WERE FILTHY I HAVE PHOTOS TO PROVE THE CONDITION OF THE ROOMS.SHE ALSO WAS SOLD A SYSTEM OF MOUTH  GUARDS THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT. THE PUSHY WOMAN SAID SHE SIGNED THE PAPER SHE OWES THE MONEY OVER $2000.00 .THEN SHE WAS SOLD ON A CREDIT CARD TO PAY FOR IT .ON LEAVING THEY REFUSED TO GIVE COPIES OF ALL THE PAPERWORK THAT SHE HAD SIGNED .ALL THEY NEEDED TO DO WAS RUN THEM THRU
THE COPY MACHINE. AND WORSE THE DENTIST USED WIRE THREADS INSTEAD OF DISSOLVABLE  SUTURES TO CLOSE THE HOLE WHERE THE TOOTH WAS.DO NOT GO TO WESTERN DENTAL .</Review>

<text>called 800 number I found on the internet ad to ask about their insurance plan advertised. Was told it would be $131.00 and to pay it when I got to the same day appointment. The ad said no rock star prices and advertised cheap prices with the plan. At the appointment I paid the insurance price of $131. The estimate was nothing like the advertised price. The office said their discount plan was not the same as the ad. The prices for fillings are very high. $225 for fillings, over $1000 for a crown. Calling the 800 number back did no good because they switch you back and forth between the office I went to for my appointment and the office that set the appointment and no one knows anything. Plus you are on hold or the phone hangs up on you. So don’t count on discount prices. False advertising.The original estimate says $8277.00 without the plan. No cavities, great gums. They want to replace 2 crowns, two fills, fill one a lost filling and add a crown to that, a mouth guard for $432 in case I grind my teeth , xrays ,exams and cleaning. Seems like normal prices on the high end without insurance to me.<//text><name>shane purdue<//name></record>

I have excruciating tooth pain due to a cavity reaching my nerve. I made an appointment here to be seen in hopes they could help. I sat patiently for HOURS and instead of alleviating the pain they only wanted to SELL me a cleaning. Never did they a address the pain. There is no sense of urgency here. You can literally hear them dragging their feet as they move around. Worst dental experience of my life. And I'm still in pain.< /text>

This place deserves a negative star. We took all three kids there for their annual check up. The appointment was at 1 and an hour and a half later we still weren't seen. They stated our wait was due to insurance issues. My husband works for insurance so the insurance issues were actually due to laziness on their part. When I asked them again about how long the wait would be, the staff was rude.

Two out of the 3 children luckily didn't need anything other than a cleaning. My oldest child however, needed to have two extractions. There team of Dentists and Dental assistants had no communication between each other. It makes me wonder if they even pulled out the right teeth, especially after they were going to put on the sealant at the end and didn't know which teeth needed to be sealed. Their equipment was rusty and the time in between procedures was unacceptable. This job wasn't done by just one person, it was done by multiple people on the staff.

As we left, my other daughter said she heard one of the Dental Assistants yelling at another patient. Unprofessional and totally uncalled for. I feel so bad for my children. They should not have had to go through this experience to get their teeth cleaned. It is experiences like this that make people fear the dentist.

I would not recommend this place to anybody. In fact, we plan on reporting them. They are dirty, unprofessional, rude and don't take anybody's time into consideration.</Text>

This office is horrible! Took my daughter in for her 6 month check up. When they called her back they wouldn't let me go back with her and she's only 10 years old. They said once they review the X-rays and see what needs to be done they would call me back. i had waited for about an hour already when my daughter comes out and says the visit is done. I come to find out that she had two fillings done and was given flouride without me being notified or signing any consents! When I notified the front office the receptionist agreed with me that they were very unorganized and handed me several business cards so I could call and complain. It seemed as though this wasn't the first time it happened.</text>

< review>
I came here for a check up on my son I had a 3:30 appointment and showed up at 3:35 mind you my son was already checked in all they had to do was see him. They refused to see him because they said he was already check in and out without seeing my son they also said they close at 4 when online and in the store front says they close at 4:30. I also had an appointment there awhile back for myself, I had a 10:30 appointment and I didn’t get out of there until 2:45 for a simple cleaning. Someone is really dropping the ball over here I will never personally go there nor will my children. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to go here ever!< /review>

The worst,  insurance definitely plays a part in their horrible service. I am traveling an hour to get a friend to his appointments. they are always set for a specific time yet they leave you waiting 45 minutes to an hour everytime. I will pay for my friend dental insurance so he never has to home back . The waiting room is a factory of cattle.</Text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>This was one of the worst dental experiences I have ever had! I wish I would have read the reviews prior to my appointment. The person doing the X-rays was great, Danielle! The dentist numbed my mouth, I then had a terrible and not thorough cleaning. It consisted of the woman applying the polish and then rinsing it off. That was it and not to mention there was water dripping down the side of my face and the paste in my hair! Then I was left to sit there for 10-15 minutes waiting for the dentist to return. He started on my fillings. When finished he asked how my bite was but I was unable to tell be use the whole right side of my mouth was numb. He told me I needed to return in 2 days to finish filling the cavity because he could not numb me anymore to do it now. Then Danille put some "vitamins" on my teeth and I was wakes out. Went to my car and gagged from the stuff in my mouth and tried to spit it out. Decided to look in my mouth. What a mistake!! My gums were bleeding, there were pieces of the metal material used for the filling all over in my mouth and my teeth were brown from whatever was put on my teeth. I went back inside to ask a few questions and was completely disappointed. I let them know I would not be returning nor brining my children as planned. After 5 hours of being numb I decided to try and eat only to find there is a hole in one of my teeth. The cavity that was filled was between the teeth and a huge space left with no filling.< /text>< Pictures>

Horrible experience. The only good thing decent about my visit was the xrays. Other than that I did not feel welcomed or valued at all. The staff attempted to push and rush into getting work done. When asking questions the staff acted as I was a nuisance.  I will not return. I wish I would of read reviews before my visit.<//Text>

<review>I cant speak on all Western Dental but this Hemet location is horrible, customer service is poor and the wait time is ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend no one to come here ... Im scared of the dentist and i stated it to the dentist well i need fills but after the next day my teeth were sensitive like she didnt do it right (she did not fix my problem) . I've always heard bad things but i decided to give them a chance BUT nope !!! Everything is poor ....< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
VERY UNHAPPY!!!! This place is extremely filthy and they removed the wrong teeth from my son. When they discovered that the mistake had happened all that was said," was oops!"  Sorry we need to take out more teeth. He has had his braces on for five years and we have had four different orthodontist.  I feel the mistakes have been on purpose to be able to charge me more for their horrible service.  I have one more child that will need braces.  I will not return to this unorganized,dirty place that rips people off.   Tell a friend!< /Review>

I have insurance for my family for a reason.  not to pay out of pocket more than I have to.I will no longer go there and will strongly recommend people to go somewhere else for dental care. hopefully my point gets out there since the staff doesn't show that they care or are even concerned!</Text>< rate>

My 17 yr old daughter wanted braces we called the 800 number and were given a promotional offer of $0 down and $99 a month the first visit is free to determine what treatment if any was needed and x-rays. The second visit would be to start the process. My grandma went with my daughter for the EVALUATION appt. and when I came home, I found my daughter with braces on her teeth and my no treatment plan or paperwork. They had told my daughter they didn't have the $99 promotion anymore and had my grandma sign paperwork they said was for treatment (WHICH WAS A CONTRACT) she was not aware she was signing a financial contract and Amy told her it was just for treatment. I asked Amy the ortho finance manager on the second appt. to change the payment plan to the advertised $99 a month which is Still plastered all over the building and to lower the interest rate if it was based on credit which was a lie. Now I have filed a Grievance  and have to wait 30 days for a response after spending 2 hours on the phone being told that everyone I talked to could not help me. The lady Maria in the corporate finance office was rude (granted I was furious by this time) and told me that my grandma should have read what she was signing. Are you kidding me !!! It was supposed to be consent for the x-ray and evaluation. The Orthodontist could not even tell me if my daughter needed to have her wisdom teeth pulled to make room to move her teeth properly. Why am I going to pay $6000 for a procedure that will just get messed up because he didn't know what he was doing. If he dose know he didn't instill confidence in me that he had a clear plan. All lies and ridiculous money charges for crappy service and the entire experience outside this office with corporate has been just as bad so far. If anyone has started a class action lawsuit against this business let me know I will join it.< /Review>

<text>Who ever does the authorizations needs to get FIRED. I've waited longer than a year to get my wisdom teeth removed and I've had to go in 2xs because I had to do a 6 month check up before  they submit for the authorization no one called me or anything I called everytime to western dental now I have to go in for the 3rd time! This is ridiculous definitely not going back again after I get my wisdom teeth removed this office is a JOKE!!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1455835964337, 'text': 'Hello Valerie,\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to leave us with a review.

Talk about being treated like cattle. Worst dental experience ever. I now have a gum infection. Every worker here from the receptionist to the guy sweeping the floor is very unprofessional and rude. I'm surprised the department of health and safety hasn't shut this place down.< /text>

HORRIBLE!
My grandmother paid for my whole Ortho. treatment, but my contract but it ended because I had a tooth that was still under the gums, so my treatment wasn't finished. I was looking to start up a new contract, but they wanted me to pay the money that my grandmother already paid for (for the retainers and for the removal of my braces which is an extra $500). They told me that because my contracted ended they couldn't transfer the money, and at first a lady at the desk tried to say my grandmother "didn't" pay for it... What a scam!! They are trying to take as much money as they can. If you were looking to have a treatment done here I would keep on looking for another place!< /text>

<Review>i took my sister last week for her 6 month check up and they kept asking if this was her first time there. we have been going there for as long as i can remember and they have NO RECORD FOR HER?! i'm 21, turning 22 this july, and my mom signed a paper last year saying i am an authorized guardian bc i'm the one who usually takes my sister to the dentist, on a count that my mom works and can't make it. the lady that was "helping" was a bit rude in the beginning and gave us all the papers we've signed before and said we had to fill them all out again. my sisters appointment was at 1:00 and she wasn't called back till around 2:25 one other lady had just came in and her daughter was called within 10 min. it was around 2:50 when i asked if i could leave for 20 min because i had to go pick up my cousin at school, the lady said i couldn't leave without me singing the papers so i asked for them because it had been 35 min already since my sister was called back there and she said they were still reviewing her teeth -.- and that it wouldn't be long now for the papers. i said fine. waited another 15 min still NOTHING i went up to the desk again and asked a different lady... the papers were in the front the WHOLE TIME! i was late for my cousin, like half an hour late. they are becoming less organized and less professional every visit.<//Review>< Pictures>

I knew that I had a possible root canel, so I made an appt. because it was free.  I walked out in tears, because I was told I need two root canals and a filling. I also needed a special cleaning and a mouth guard. The dentist didn't even bother to look in my mouth.  The mouth guard is what tipped me off to this place. Prior to moving here, I went to the same dentist for 20 years and was never told I grind my teeth and needed a guard. So I went and got a 2nd opinion. I have only the one tooth that MIGHT need a root canal.  BUT there is no sign of a 2nd one or a cavity. Not only do I not need a special cleaning, but I don't grind my teeth!
THiS PLACE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN!</text>

This place is horrible! You sit for hours waiting to be seen the staff don't care, don't even acknowledge that you're there. No point in making an appointment. Always under staffed. They're rude, very unorganized, just all bad! Don't even deserve this one star.<//Text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>My mom has only had 2 appts for this office . Both times, this office has failed to send over authorizations to my moms insurance company , in a timely manner. There customer service is horrible(Yolanda). They never have called me back when they promised to, (she actually did promise she would twice now) . They are full of excuses why everything that they touch goes wrong. Our insurance company even told me that,"Sounds like this dental office doesnt know what they are doing" . I have been in customer service for 25 years. I understand that no one is perfect . Most people can understand if mistakes are made . But when you combine that with poor communication , it gives one the feeling that they just dont care about their patients.If the owner cared , they would look at hiring a new manager for the office. I will be switching my moms dentist as soon as we get this referral for extraction. (which we have been waiting , in pain , for a week) Like others have stated , I wouldnt even give this place 1 star , but you had to , so you could place your comment. Steer clear of Western Dental 3027 W. Florida Ave Hemet Ca.< /Text>< pictures>

Whenever they give you an appointment, you have to wait a long time for them to attend you, sometimes more than an hour and a half, I do not understand why they give you an appointment if they will attend you until their gift swells, very bad to respect  the schedule of your appointment !!!< /text>

(Translated by Google) I am reliving a root canal treatment, the truth is very bad service, it is good for you mother to come with pain, apart from that they do not leave you medicine for pain or inflammation, and they take a long time I left you the appointment at an hour and wings half an hour They attend you
