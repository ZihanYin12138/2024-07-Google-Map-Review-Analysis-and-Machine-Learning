Many of these stores have moved back their opening hour to 9 am, so when I needed to print a document before a court appearance at Metro Court nearby I came here.  This is a "dtla" location inside an office building on Wilshire. I got there 15 minutes early to find parking and still ended up walking 10 minutes from a meter. There is no dedicated parking. Looked like you can't even park in the building if you wanted to (it's gated, gate was closed.) This location seems like it would mostly be useful for people who are already there, so you don't have to park. If you do, give yourself an extra 15/20 minutes and be ready to pay to park.</Review>< Pics>

I teach an online writing class and was visiting a friend in L.A.  His scanner wasn't working and I was in a panic, needing to scan and email a stack of student papers back fast.  Yami stayed and helped me get the whole stack scanned even though her shift had ended. VERY GRATEFUL!</Review>

My brother went into this particular fedex to ship some items to me. I stayed on the phone through the process. It was awful. The staff was very discourteous. I can't believe such nasty people would be in customer service. Ruth was on the floor and Liz was the manager. Two terrible people. They were also laughing at my brother. I can't get over it. If I could give no stars, I would. Awful!!!< /Text>

Customer service = Gross.
Employee named Yami = Gross attitude. After walking to the counter chewing food, she LIED and told me that Fed Ex doesn't carry bags (I asked her for a bag to carry out my color copies).  I asked her three times for a bag. I then asked her what people do when they purchase things from here. She said they just walk out with the merchandise and that Fedex doesn't have bags. I told her that I went to a fedex last night and got a paper bag to put my items in and she said that she was sorry and gave me a confused look. I asked another lady to confirm that they don't have bags and this lady went and got a bag for me. I asked Yami about this and she said she thought I was asking about plastic bags.</Text>

I came in to the establishment as I was lost, didn’t have a map, and my phone had a dead battery. I sat down at one of their desk chair cubicle spaces. I didn’t make any noise, nor did I bother anyone. The so called manager, Yesse is a mean and foul customer service rep. She didn’t need to raise her voice at me. I had done nothing wrong. She needs a demotion and a pay decrease. No wonder this place stinks. I couldn’t even come in to charge my phone for five minutes at a designated space.</text>

I saw all the bad reviews and was worried but honestly it was a good experience. Maybe it's because I went on a Sunday and not very busy. Felicita helped me with sending out my package and was kind and knowledgeable. No complaints, would come again.< /review>

I would give this branch a 0 star if i could.  The people who work here should all be fired and prohibited from any service oriented job in the world. Every single time we have to drop off a box shipment, these women always turn us away. They invent reasons why not to take our boxes. They provide zero help to fix the so called problem they invented. They just refuse to take our shipment.  We always end up having to walk up a few blocks to the other Fed-ex office to ship or merchandise. Where it gets picked up and delivered with no problems. It's ludicrous what these employees do.  We wish new Fed-ex would restaff this office as it's closer to us.</Text>

Went to print some documents on cardstock. I used the self service print station and couldn't get any help whatsoever from the staff. I mean - self service is cool and all but I certainly haven't been trained on industrial printers, and I doubt this is uncommon.

Go to the location in Little Tokyo, the people who work there act a lot less like they are on the verge of suicide.<//text>

I came to this location because the Hp printer I bought wasn’t functioning correctly and I needed to scan and print documents for work and school. Needless to say the technician told me I wasn’t going to get charged for time but for the amount I printed and scanned. I later received a bill for 20.00 dollars for one black and white print job and three scanned copies.

When I later asked them about the transaction they told me they misinformed me that it was based on time. I turned a blind eye and assumed I was wrong. I came a few days later to drop of a prepaid package and made me wait a 20 minutes just to submit it. I won’t be coming back to this location. Done.<//review>

A lot of standard jobs that will take other spots an hour to do, this one will give you a turn around of a day to get it done.

I am not sure if this location is just busier than others but it is extremely laggy.  If its a job that can be done on one of the copiers or kiosk the worker will end up sending you to do it on your own without any direction of how to use the machine.

Terrible experience here and I feel like I always have that at this location. Will definitely be looking for another location. The customer service is bad, along with the print quality being horrible and the staff not caring. If I wasn't in a hurry I would've refused to pay for the low quality print job I received and the shotty service. Very unhappy customer.< /Text>

Computers abundantly available for printing, which is why I go.  I'm in & out quickly. There is free parking on 8th, just a nice walk up Dunsmuir st. Seems empty when you walk in though. Could be a little bit more alive. ... a lil music or something. Come to think about it I've never seen an employee there... I walk in use the computers on the immediate left when you  walk in....print my docs and out the door.< /review>

<review>Use the FedEx at westin bon adventure, had to wait 2 hours to print while the other fedex does it in 1 minute. They also have "work order" so even if a simple binding of paper would take them 2 hours. The other one did it in 30 seconds.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b15d8b0a83:0xd2575f25c108b0b1< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I would give them a 0 star if I could.  Seriously the laziest workers I have ever had to deal with.  You can tell they hate their jobs and don't want to lift a finger.  Not efficient at all and their customer service is literally horrible.  If you hate your jobs that much you shouldn't be there.  Had the worst experience ever!!!!</Review>

<text>Really disappointed. I needed my passport picture taken and got it done here. Went to the passport agency with a scheduled appointment. Told after a long wait, that the picture was over exposed and too close. That I'd have to go take another one and come back. This set me back an additional hour. It was very unnecessary. Don't take your passport picture there!< /text>< user>

I brought 7 packages to this location. I ship these packages with FedEx daily. The manager at this store on Tuesday April 12th at 9:10 PM refused 3 packages arbitrarily. How can FedEx grow as a business when managers turn away packages? I didn't even require receipts all they had to do was scan the packages.</Text>

The gentleman if you can call him that dismissed me and basically said he didn't have time to help me with an order that cannot be done using the print and go. Horrific service. Typical PopCopy Experience.< /Text>

The service is quick and professional. The prices are on par with resort town prices (typically over 10$ when ordering a meal) The location of the restaurant is pretty ideal, sitting on the corner of the main thoroughfare of Mammoth.<//Text>

<text>Great food, but the service could have been better. The man taking our order at the drive-thru was not even attempting to be friendly. It looked like only two people were working, one of which had his mask on his chin, which concerned me. There were two people ahead of us, no one behind us. After the first two ppl got their food and left, a worker, the same one who just took our money not two minutes earlier, asked us if we were waiting for food and what we ordered. It’s pretty bad to lose track of your customers and orders that quickly when you aren’t even busy. Also skip the chocolate shake. You could make a better one at home. The chicken sandwich was great, the fries were fresh and tasty! We got an extra burger with no explanation. We appreciate it but sadly didn’t have the belly room to eat it.<//text><pics>None</pics><rating>3<//rating></record></dataset><record>

I love Carl's Jr's hamburgers better than any other fast food establishement. They are always fresh, hot, and grilled rather than fried. Better quality for a good price!</Review>

As usual burgers are the best, never the less service in this store is the worse ever.

Also cursing in the kitchen should be forbidden, even if it is in other lenguage. I have been in better behaved cantinas.

The lines are so long!  The only "fast food" in Mammoth is anything but fast!  Also the mose expensive CJ's I've ever been too, over $40.00 for 4 items!
:(  The upside is that the crew is always friendly< /Review>

Tried calling this location due to I had a trailer on my pickup and could not fit into the drive thru and wanted to see if there was any other option so that I could purchase some food before continuing another three hours with my drive. They either did not answer at all or they would answer and than hang up.
First time tryin to stop by here and will now be the last even though I frequent the area. Poor, poor service!</Text>

The sausage patty was so small compared to the bread. Finally getting to the patty on a number of bites, it was extremely salty. If you want a salty patty breakfast sandwich, this is for you. Can't figure out how Carl's could charge so much for their food.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Very slow.  I just ordered one order or Jalapeno Poppers.  There was no one waiting inside and slow traffic through the drive through.  It took over 20 minutes to complete the order.  Other people, who had complex orders and come in 10 minutes after us were served minutes before us.  It was fairly clean.  The employees were not very friendly.  I used to come here often.  Now I remember why I stopped going.</review>

Food is generally less than average for fast food.  There are much better fast food restaurants, but not always available.  So Carl's works in a pinch.< /Text>

Its not the newest place, there is quite some wear to the furniture etc. Staff could also spend some more time cleaning the seating area, even though it was mostly empty most tables where dirty and there was food on the floor. The burgers where delicious though, fresh ingredients and cooked perfectly.<//text>

<rating>2< /rating><review>Food was outstanding. What ruined our meal was the fact that an employee came and sat next to us, despite the empty dining room, passed gas repeatedly, and blared music from his phone. Even after we looked at him, he kept the volume on. Another problem was that we couldn't use the restroom. The women's restroom was filthy, urine in EVERY toilet, and mold and silt in the corners.< /review>< pics>

The only thing I didn't care for was that it was not very cool inside and it was 100° outside! They needed t ok also have someone taking care of the tables in the dining room.

The worst experience ever, they took my order, and they did it wrong, then they didn’t honor the double charbroiled cheeseburger deal, I waited for over half hour to get the food because they forgot to make it, bad service won’t recommend this place at all</Review>

In addition to that, the restaurant is very clean. I'd recommend this place if you crave a burger. Plus their Criss Cut Fries are delicious! :)</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>My wife asked for a hamburger with ketchup, lettuce, and tomato. The cashier didn't know what she wanted. She ended up reading EVERY SONGLE INGREDIENT and asking if my wife wanted it. Then it took 10 minutes to get a milkshake, when it was no where near busy. Avoid if possible.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Placed order in drive thru, for 4 sausage biscuit, she confirmed. 10 minutes later behind 2 cars, she got our bag in hand, and took another order & didn't give us our bag. While she held the bag, another lady walked up. We asked if she was manager, she nodded yes. We began to tell her the lady was holding our bag. This manager walked away.  After lady completed taking the other order, she asked if we wanted salsa, we asked for cream sugar. She handed bag to us. Got back to room and had 4 sausage, egg, cheese biscuit. No cream, sugar (I had not checked my bag before we drove off). Threw away the egg, scrapped off cheese. Took back the other 2 and asked for money back.  Found out lady was assistant manager. Asked for manager. Found out he was standing there all along and never jumped in to help solve the problem. Like the first 2, he never responded. I wonder now if they could speak English?  We got our money back on those 2.  Very frustrating breakfast event. Might as well talked to the wall about delay, wrong order and being ignored.< /Text>< Rating>

It's a Carl's Jr.  It serves the same food everywhere.  This location lacked parking and the lighting at night is bad.  However, it fills the stomach, and that's what I needed.< /review>

Food is good and  fast. It's the only fast food place around. Service is friendly.  Restroom is clean.

Very friendly place, I enjoyed the service. I've noticed nothing but good deeds towards customers every time I go there. Whether drive-thru or walk-in.
Gave it a 4 cuz the chicken samich was a little over done and dry, but more mayo would've helped it quite a bit.
Over all though it was pleasant for fast food. Dining in is more nastalgic.</review>

On my visit this location was dirty, rundown and unorganized. This Carl,s Jr. needs management to whip it into shape. I have been to other locations in lesser neighborhoods that were much better.<//Text>

⭐️I'd give it none of I could. The place was filthy. Most of the employees seemed more engaged with family and friends that were in the restaurant than the customers. A guy in front of me ordering food walked back into the kitchen and grabbed himself a cup.  (was either an off shift employee or family/friend of the cashier I guess.) My food was below average too, didn't even finish my burger. I usually love CJ's, won't be going back to this one.< /review>

Burgers are simple taste but price is quite high. Staff who I met was rude. She give me incorrect amount of changes and I give them back and she show faces when she serve burgers to me she not even smile and look at my face.< /Text>

Seats were disgusting, once we got our drink we noticed it it was flat. After that we got our food and they cooked two of our burgers wrong. They brought the first burger back, and then we waited five more minutes for the cheeseburger. The cook or someone working there had spit in the burger. I recommend never going to this carls jr.< /Text>

I walked in and I trip. And then the hot girl in the corner saw me so I took off my pants and her young stallion employee brother kicked me out of my favorite place in the world. Along with this my burger was aight. Soda okay. And the fries were criss cut for some reason even though I asked for fries that were cross cut.< /review>

<Text>The restaurant was dark, run down, and the employees were not ready to work when we walked in.. One of the ordering clerks had her purse over her shoulder and she was playing with a baby of a customer. The clerk's hair was hanging down in her face and she kept pushing it away.
The plastic tiles on the walls by the ordering counter were coming down and the dark, rundown, stinky bathroom had a toilet that wouldn't flush.
We walked out without ordering.<//Text></record>

<time>1501732916825< /time><rate>4<//rate><Review>(Translated by Google) The usual burger assortment is almost as affordable as anywhere else. The big disadvantage of the place is that it has no terrace while other Carl's restaurants have always had one. Here, among the vast snowy mountains, one would love to sit out, much more so than in a restaurant without air conditioning.

(Original)
A megszokott burger választék közel azon az áron, mint máshol. A hely nagy hiányossága, hogy nincs terasza, míg a többi Carl's étteremnél eddig mindig volt. Itt pedig a hatalmas havas hegyek között különösen szívesen ülne ki az ember, sokkal szívesebben, mint a klíma nélküli étterembe.< /Review>< Pictures>

I've been using this place since I was a kid. This place is the most easy and stress free waste resource facility in the Bay Area and the prices are very fair. The employees are also excellent. You are in and out at this place and there is nothing but positive vibes.< /review>

<review>What a great place to dump stuff because it's so neat and clean.
I don't get nails in my tires like the Novato dump.
Carlos Viejo will greet you at the scale and weigh your load. He's very kind, helpful and has a beautiful Smile !
Great place plus there's beautiful Peacocks on the lawn!  5 STARS< /review>< time>

The best prices in in all Bay area really fast and clean
In Richmond it's too expensive the authorities have to do something there now
That's why many people just throw away the trash on the streets in Richmond because it's too high the price to get on the disposal services< /text>

$43 minimum charge. Line moves fairly quickly. Check out the display of old metal construction toys, dump trucks in the island just before you pay.</Review>

Who would have thought that a "dump" could be so cool?  All of Marin Sanitary's operations are top-notch.  They've very environmentally conscious and involved with the community.  They also do a lot with the stuff that's discarded.  The dump area of the facility is clean and always kept up.  It's very, very easy to access.  You just drive through the entry point and pay the fees (reasonable considering how much work they do with the trash), and you can back right up to a location and throw stuff into a large cement "pit".  It's more like your'e just on a loading dock because the "pit" is huge and there's all sorts of equipment and people  constantly clearing it.< /Text>

I, idiotically, threw away a boot that contained a diamond ring in its box still.  I, along with 5 other gentlemen with gigantic hearts, searched through the gigantic garbage pile for 3.5 hours. We couldn't find it, but with that kind of goodness being shown, my faith in humanity was increased.  Thank you to the men that helped me that day and Jose who was the manager that allowed me to look through the trash.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>I wish I could give this review 10 stars. My surgery with Dr. Davis went flawlessly and far exceeded my expectations. I was nervous at first like most anyone is with surgery, but I am SO glad I went through with it! The professionalism, friendliness, and expertise are just a few of the things I will mention when referring everyone here! Thank you!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Let me start by how impressed I was with all the staff who helped my daughter from the consultation  and each person from the front desk , the nurse, anesthesiologist and especially the doctor who accepted her as a patient. When I walked in with my daughter everyone is so friendly and very detailed in the care and expectations  of her rhinoplasty then how she was treated after her surgery  was so impressive. I will definitely recommend this place to everyone . And thank you to all the staff each of you are amazing!<//Review>

Dr.  Kaufman & Davis are excellent surgeons. I have had three procedure done; they have been all extremely successful. So much so, that three family member have had procedure done, two family member also use the Botox and aesthetician services. One of my friends had arm surgery and she is so happy, she had suffered with the big lumps of skin that hung on her arms, now she can wear regular clothes and she no longer has the extra weight hanging on her arms. It is not just family ,that uses  Kaufman & Davis I am a business owner and two of my employees have had surgery at Kaufman & Davis. To top this off we have to drive seven hours to see the doctor! He is worth the time and drive.<//Text>

I had a breast augmentation after having my two kids. Told them what I was hoping for, showed them pictures and Dr. Kauffman did EXACTLY what I wanted!! My results were more then perfect, I'm more then happy with my experience at their office! Everyone was very professional and nice. 10/10 recommend for any of your cosmetic needs! You will not regret it!< /Review>

<text>I had the best experience at Kaufman and Davis Plastic Surgery. I was very nervous about getting a breast augmentation and worried about not being satisfied with the results. All the staff there were so professional and friendly and helped me to feel at ease. Dr. Kaufman really listened to my concerns and I couldn’t be happier with the results. I had absolutely no complications and felt fine the next day. It was a very easy recovery for me and I feel so confident and happy with my body now. Dr. Kaufman is very good at what he does and I highly recommend him!<//text><Time>1609736198279< /Time><user>104346624620471018548< /user></record></dataset><record>

<review>The ambiance and cleanliness of the office is great— however, the front desk workers don’t wear a mask.. kind of inappropriate, sorry.
I had gotten a facial and consultation for cool sculpting. The aesthetician didn’t do a good job at answering any questions I had about general skincare products and it felt rushed and uncomfortable. This was somewhat of a jarring issue I had here.
The cool sculpting was fine and she gave me time to ask about it if necessary, and the pricing was good/equal compared to other centres.
This is not my first time getting procedures done or being in a cosmetic surgeon’s office, so I give a 3 star based on those few factors, one should never feel rushed and employees should follow CDC guidelines, even just out of politeness.<//review>< Pictures>

Please don't provide an email if your response is just going to push me into calling. I, and likely others, prefer email vastly over phone calls for a variety of reasons. Accessibility is worth normalizing.</Text>

I went to Dr. Davis for my Breast Augmentation after extensive research on different surgeons all throughout California. I knew immediately after my consultation that I trusted in Dr. Davis to safely get me to the results that I wanted.

Dr. Davis is extremely personable, knowledgeable, patient, and skilled in the art of plastic surgery. He took the time to address all of my concerns and goals for my breast augmentation, and the result far exceeded my expectations. I am only one week post op, but I am already loving the result and changes so far.

I would recommend trusting in Dr. Davis if you are interested in getting a breast augmentation. Dr. Davis and the entire staff made me welcomed and cared for throughout the whole process and I am thankful for everyone there who made the decision and process a great one.</text>

< review>
Dr. Kaufman did a decent job on my lower facelift but botched my breast implant replacement and made one side larger than the other...I was crushed! He did not make any effort to apologize or tried to make it right.  And during my surgery my eyes were not protected and my corneas were severely scratched and had to go to an eye doctor to be treated.  I would not recommend him.</review>

What an AMAZING experience I had at Kaufman and Davis Plastic Surgery Center.
I want to say how very pleased I am not only with the result but with the whole process.
The center itself is on par with the best of those in Beverly Hills,  the office is Gorgeous you know that you are in good hands. The surgery center is immaculateand attached to the the  office, is one huge facility.
The staff is kind and caring,  I have had injections with them,  which led me to getting my breasts re done.  They do not up sell you at all they will be honest with opinions if you want them. Dr.Davis is very kind, he takes his time with you he is patient,  I want to recommend Dr.Davis 100% and his practice you can't go wrong This is the BEST PLACE!!!<//Review>

Both are extremely skilled and amazing doctors! I was extremely pleased with the results I got. I had the whole mommy makeover and I have hard time deciding which part of my body I now love the most. These doctors took great care of me and their service was outstanding. They went above and beyond of my expectations throughout the whole process. I am definitely coming back if I need anything else done :) and I strongly recommend their practice.<//Review>

When I finally made the decision to have a tummy tuck, I was overwhelmed with the number of plastic surgeons. I really can’t begin to count the number of reviews I read, the sites I searched to validate credentials.. FINALLY, I decided on Kaufman and Davis.. now I had to choose which surgeon to pick! Lol I followed their Facebook page and picked apart their website! I found that both Dr.Kaufman and Dr.Davis we’re both amazing at what they do! So I called in to schedule a consultant. What a long week it was before my appointment 😆 I was excited yet very nervous. Immediately I was welcomed into the office, and an overwhelming sense of relief swept over me. The office is beautiful everyone I came into contact was so nice! I sat and talked with Sandy..She sat with me to get all my information, and answer any general questions before Dr.Davis came into the room..(BTW..I LOVE HER!!) Dr. Davis came in and made me feel so comfortable, all anxiety flew right out the window. He checked out what we were working with, and told me what he felt would be my best options.. (because of Covid we video chatted with my hubby so he informed at the same time).. fast forward.. I received quote for each different procedure.. it was nice to have such a detailed quote.. I spoke with my husband when I got home and decided to have my procedure scheduled... Again, longest 8 weeks I’ve ever endured! Unfortunately I had a late afternoon surgery.. so I had all morning to stress over my upcoming procedure(on and off crying all morning😭😂).. as I sat in the pre-op my nurse(I unfortunately forgot her name I was soo anxious) was amazing, she got me peeped, and calmed me down with friendly talk and joking.. after I was walked into the surgery room, I have no recollection of that day..
First night we stayed in a local hotel, I had a little soup and was out.. I did wake up to my husbands phone ringing and hearing Dr. Davis on the other end checking on how I was recovering
(huge kudos in my book!)
Day after surgery I went to my 1st appointment and saw my perfect belly for the first time! 🥰😍
Each day there was a noticeable improvement, any questions or concerns were answered though an app on my phone!
Now I’m on 11 days post-op.. I feel GREAT! I decided to pull out that tote ... you know the one... the “I’ll fit into these again someday tote.” I ran in and out of the closet yelling and crying “OMG! OMG!!” I look amazing already and I’m still so swollen!!!  I can’t wait to see what this body has in store for me..
Dr. Davis.. I can’t thank you enough.. my results are way beyond what I expected. My confidence is through the roof, and I can’t wait to show off my results! ❤️</review>

<Review>I'll start this by saying everyone in this office was very nice and it was overall a pleasant experience. I'll also say this is my first experience with fillers, so I'm not really an authority on this, I'll just give you the details and let you make your own decisions, and I may update this review in the future if I learn more. I went in for one syringe of lip filler and overall am happy with the results, but I do have that feeling they could be better. This practice uses Restylane only, no Juvederm, and on me they used Restylane Defyne. At my two week check in, I saw there was a bit of asymmetry in my top lip. One side is clearly smaller than the other, and the pink part of the lip is noticeably thinner, especially near the corner. I'm sure it's not VERY noticeable, but I'll let you decide if it would bother you. Also, you can see in the pictures it's bumpy on the larger side. There are quite a few lumps in my lips, but the only one that bothers me really is one on the larger side of my top lip where I can tell the bump is shallow, as if it happened as the needle was being pulled out or something. It is visible all the time, even when I smile. The nurse said she couldn't really see what I was talking about on either concern. She did offer to inject some dissolver into the lump, but I opted to just wait for it to get naturally smaller rather than dissolve some of the filler I paid so much for. Neither thing is really THAT noticeable, but it feels like for 500$ they should not happen, although since this was my first time I really have no idea. Even with those issues, I really do love the results and would probably still recommend, however I will probably be trying somewhere new to compare when this filler wears off.

Update: I was called by the office about this review and while I appreciate the follow up, I want to leave this information here for anyone researching different places to get lip filler. She explained to me they cannot save any filler for adjustments as it is illegal and if they were to make adjustments they would open a new syringe, but I didn’t want to spend anymore money on this at this time. They do offer half syringes which are 300$< /Review>< Response>

I can’t say enough about Dr. Kaufman and all of his AMAZING STAFF. I will recommend Dr. Kaufman to EVERYONE. Out of all the plastic surgery centers I visited this was by far the best. I love to acknowledge greatness when I see it and Dr. Kaufman is the man!  The entire team is one in a million. Thank you Dr. Kaufman for giving me everything I wanted and MORE! Thank you to ALL the staff for being so kind and supportive. It has only been 4 weeks  since my breast aug and my scars are already almost invisible and very very small! My breast look exactly like the pictures I showed him too! I am SO HAPPY.< /text>

<review>Kaufman and his team was amazing !! It was my first time having any kind of surgery , I had a breast lift with silicone implants done in November of last year ! The new office is beautiful! Everyone is so friendly and welcoming , when I came in for my surgery I was nervous but they made me feel so comfortable and made me feel that everything was going to be just fine ! The surgery went well and the after healing went well and I just had my last apt and took the after photos ! And just wow I couldn’t be any more happier with the outcome . It was the best decision I have ever made ! I have also had my lips done with fillers and they came out beautiful as well ! I always have a great experience when I’m In the office .
Definitely recommend 100% ! Kaufman and Davis are so nice and so comforting! You will love them and be so happy that you choose them !<//review><pics>None< /pics>< user>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I first became a patient of Dr. Kaufman's in 2006 & was very satisfied with his bedside manner & skill-level...fast-forward 10yrs & a tragedy occurred (& perhaps too much stress) & I had to see Dr. Kaufman again who was thoroughly tested by the severity of my acute condition. He acted quickly, minimized the damage & never sugar-coated his doubts of me ever experiencing cosmetic normalcy. I followed his strict advice for the next 6-12mos. & I'm overjoyed with my results. I am the happiest I've ever been. My condition completely healed; I have a few minimal scars, but considering how I looked 12mos prior...I AM OVER THE MOON PLEASED!! Dr. Kaufman & his staff are THE BEST in the field of cosmetic surgery. ONLY he & I TRULY KNOW what I've been through, but NO ONE would EVER guess looking at his Grade A workmanship.
I AM a satisfied patient for life!  I have & will continue to recommend others to him. He's awesome! You'll be happy with whatever you're electing to improve...I certainly am.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>I sought out Dr.Kaufman’s office on the recommendation of a friend and I am so glad I did! I had been considering having this surgery for awhile, and I knew I wanted the results but I was nervous and apprehensive about the process. Dr.Kaufman and his staff were nothing short of wonderful. Every staff member was courteous, knowledgeable, welcoming and respectful. Each visit was timely and all my questions were always answered thoroughly. I never felt rushed nor had long wait times. On the day of my surgery I was pretty nervous and Kelly made me feel so comfortable and calmed. Dr.Kaufman is clearly very good at what he does, and I could sense that he is honest and trustworthy right away. I was very happy with the results of my surgery, and my follow up care continues to be nothing short of top notch. I highly recommend Dr.Kaufman’s office and I feel so grateful that this whole process has gone so smoothly! I look forward to trying out some of the other services that they offer.< /review></record>

Two weeks post op B.A. and feeling great.  I have had a great experience with Dr. Kaufman's office. He and his staff have been professional and an absolute pleasure to work with. All have been very informative and helpful in my decision before surgery. I was originally recommended to his practice by a friend who was also happy with her results. I don't know if other facilities treat their patients this well after procedures, but I feel that I picked the absolute best doctor in this area.<//text>

I have nothing but the upmost respect, admiration and for just being who he is as a person.  He is kind, respectful, patient and personable.  You may not know this about Dr. Kaufman, but he's actually pretty funny.  I know we've shared plenty of laughs throughout the years.  He does have the BEST bedside manner I have ever had from a doctor.  He always greets you with a warm smile, a firm handshake, and maybe a gentle hug.  I've had from simple facials to extensive surgeries with Dr. Kaufman and in my experience, I've always been treated with kindness, respect and reassurance.  He and his staff are always pleasant from the moment you walk in to the time you're in recovery.  I can't say enough or could go on, but I'll let each of you have you're own experience and see for yourselves.  You will not be disappointed.  Their new location is amazing!  Top notch! Love You Dr. Kaufman and staff.  😘❤️🤗< /Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Kaufman and his staff are all very kind and caring.  I came to him with a big mess that needed to be fixed and I was not very trusting because of my past experience.  He and the staff completely understood my emotional struggle.  They always answered all of my questions and concerns and I never felt pressured.  Dr. Kaufman is a very thorough and skilled surgeon.  I just had surgery #2, the final surgery, and so far I couldn't be happier.  I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Kaufman.  I am so thankful to have found him.  I had meet with 3 other surgeons first.  All 4 surgeons had a different approach to solving my issue.  I felt Dr. Kaufman's was the safest, I felt most comfortable with him, and he and his staff gave me the reassurance and emotional support I needed.<//review>

<Review>From the first appointment I felt very comfortable with Dr. Kaufman and his entire staff. I had any questions or concerns answered. Never felt pressured to do or schedule a procedure until I was comfortable with my decision. Had the opportunity to email or call with any questions that came up. Post surgery - Dr Kaufman checked on me the evening of surgery which was very reassuring to me. I am totally pleased with my breast lift and it hasn’t even been a week. I will continue with my follow up appointments and would highly recommend his office in the future.<//Review>< rating>

<review>I just had my 6 month check up with Dr. Kaufman.  Dr. Kaufman and his staff are amazing!  I had an abdomnioplasty done last September and I am absolutely loving my new tummy.  I have always been self conscious about my stomach.  After having 3 large babies my tummy was never the same!  It was so bad, people thought I was pregnant!  My tummy is now nice and flat and I have so much more confidence in myself!  Dr. Kaufman made me feel at ease through the whole process.  The staff was so friendly and helped me with any concerns or questions that I had.  My recovery was fairly easy considering I had pretty major surgery!  And Dr. Kaufman was always willing to answer all my questions when I had any concerns about my recovery.  I definitely recommend Dr. Kaufman and his staff!< /review>< user_id>

Dr. Kaufman is a kind , caring, and thorough surgeon. His background speaks for itself! He is backed by a wonderful staff that are all knowledgeable and extremely kind. Going into these situations can be difficult, but his staff welcomes you and makes you feel like you’re at home! If you’re looking for amazing results in a caring, professional environment then look no further. I would HIGHLY recommend Dr. Kaufman to anyone! They always followed up and provided accurate and reliable information throughout the whole process. I am so greatful to have come across Dr. Kaufman. Many thanks to both him and his wonderful staff, truly a one of a kind practice.</Review>

When I walked into Dr. Kaufman’s office and met both him and his amazing staff I knew my search for a plastic surgeon was over. He was very informative, honest, personable and not to mention very skilled in his profession. I had seen three other doctors before him and knew I could trust my vision in him. I had two procedures in the span of 1 1/2 years and my results are amazing. Beyond what I expected. I couldn’t be happier with my results.</text>

<Name>Kimberly Wentland</Name><pictures>None</pictures><text>I was sold on Dr. Kaufman's work by seeing it first hand. Three of my husbands family members had been to Dr. Kaufman and had things done such as breast augmentation, face lift, breast lift, etc. They look amazing and they had nothing but great things to say about him. Meeting him just sealed the deal, he was such a sweet heart and made me feel very comfortable. His staff is also amazing!
So on to my breast augmentation. It was very quick to get on their schedule. The price wasn't bad for such an excellent doctor, plus he gives a military discount on his services. :) Surgery went well and I am now a little over 4 weeks post op and am loving my new additions!! Oh and totally unexpected they sent me a little pampering gift in the mail right after surgery, so thoughtful! :) Thank you Dr. Kaufman and to your staff for taking such good care of me! <3< /text><Date>1433481407441< /Date><UserId.>113118159562964863055< /UserId.><Resp>{'time': 1436999720795, 'text': "Thank you so much for taking a moment to share your experience with our practice.

I was beyond pleased with the care I received from Dr. Kaufman and his staff.  Very professional, honest, caring and personable.  I felt very comfortable with undergoing a face lift, tummy tuck and fat transfer.  I'm 65 years old and this was the best possible time for me to undergo these procedures as a newly retired Baby Boomer.  I would recommend Dr. Kaufman and will probably have more work done in the future, now that I see the results that can be achieved!!!</Review>

Having any sort of surgery can be daunting, however when you're going for something to change the overall look of our body, it can be a very scary one.  I couldn't be happier with everyone at Dr. Kaufman's office.  I've had a few procedures done, and everyone from those who greeted me at the front, to financing, to the amazing nurses to Dr. Kaufman himself made the experience so much easier.  All of my questions were answered honestly!  All of my concerns were quickly put to rest and each time I've come to the office, it's always a pleasure.  I'm so happy we have this office in my home town!  Thank you to everyone at the office...you've made being a patient with you, a pleasure!< /text>

I had the most amazing experience with Dr. Clark and Surgical staff! Surgical Nurse had me laughing at 6:00am, keeping my Husband calm and wishing I could keep her forever! Dr. Clark followed up with me personally and made sure I knew she was on call for me that night if I needed her. What Doctor does that?
I was referred by a co-worker who saw Dr. Clark (who was referred by a handful or two of her Patients that saw both Surgeons). I was also referred by two of my own Patients who saw Dr. Kaufman.
On top of all that, my Husband who is darn near impossible to impress reads the Bio on Dr. Kaufman while sitting in the waiting room at my follow up he and the words actually come out of his mouth, "I'm impressed"!!<//Text>

I could not be happier with my face and neck lift. I had gotten a referral to Dr. Kaufman and was so comfortable at my consultation that I booked that same day. The staff was so helpful and kind to me before and after my surgery. I think that Dr. Kaufman is a miracle worker and I could not recommend him more highly. If you have an issue, he will speak with you and give you an honest assessment of what to expect. I think that I was actually more impressed with the results than I had hoped.<//text>

I had an amazing experience! Every member if the staff was so nice and went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. I felt like I got a lot of one on one personal treatment.From the first time I walked in the door to pre-op to now, It was all perfect. My results are better than I could imagine. I get compliments everyday and I think I have people who are seriously looking into going here for there beautification needs.< /Text>

This was something I had thought about for a long time.  Waking up everyday to see my Mother in the mirror made me feel old.  I did my research and could not have made a better choice. The office staff were knowledgeable and extremely helpful.  Dr Kaufman inspired the trust I needed and his thoughtfulmess and expertise was beyond my expectations.  My results were awesome giving me my youth back and I am again my Mothers daughter!!< /Text>

I went to Kaufman & Clark for a breast reduction surgery.  I was impressed by the beautiful facility and kind staff.  The process of assessment, pre-op, surgery, & post-op was very smooth because the staff clearly communicates the series of appointments, payment procedure, personal responsibilities, and medications. After surgery, close friends and family were quite relieved to see that I felt well.  Just about everyone commented that I looked SO much better, much thinner.  I hid my large chest size well.  My husband even remarked, "It's like you can wear a bikini top without apologizing" - he was referring to the fact that I could NEVER manage to find a top large enough to be appropriate. Since my surgery was quite smooth and has had such great results, my sister is now considering the reduction herself.  The price of surgery at Kaufman & Clark does seem on the higher end.  However, the Dr.'s are very well educated and the results are excellent in my opinion.  You get what you pay for.< /text>

Absolutely amazing experience. My wife was very worried about doing her breast augmentation and almost flew to Portland to have the surgery done. After reading the amazing reviews and talking to Dr. Kaufman at our consultation we knew this was the best choice. Every step of the procedure, my wife and I were explained in full detail and given plenty of options with explanations. The environment this facility provides is incomparable, we came in unsure and worried and left very happy and excited. It's been almost 3 months since surgery and my wife is amazed at the way she looks and feels. Thank you Dr. Kaufman and your lovely staff for a wonderful experience.< /Text>

<Text>“My most recent experience with Kaufman & Clark Plastic Surgery was my second time dealing with Dr. Kaufmann and the staff there.  I cannot begin to tell you how comfortable I felt, how much I appreciated Dr. Kaufman’s suggestions and explanations on what I could expect, the individual attention I received at all times (always on-time and never hurried), and the wonderful staff who have become almost like family!  I am one week out from my last surgery – which was MAJOR (multiple areas addressed) – and I feel great and am reassured by the staff that all is healing well.  I would highly recommend Kaufman & Clark for ANY “artistic” changes and enhancements you’d like for your own body.”</Text></record>

I am a 33 year old mother of two toddlers. Proud to say that i breast fed. I have had benign fatty tumors in both breasts since the age 15. These were huge, lemon sized. Being 5'3 and 130 lbs with a 34B bust, I knew once the lumps were removed my breasts would be gone as well. So I scoured the net for a plastic surgeon who would remove the lumps as well as a breast lift and enhancement in one procedure so I wouldn't have to undergo two surgeries and wait to heal in between. I searched for months , but hadn't seen anyone I felt I could trust so I gave up for awhile. Time went by and the lumps began to deform my breast so I couldn't wait longer. This time I found Dr Kaufman.. if you're reading this then you are lucky to have found him too! What a god send. So many patients and all the positive things they said ,I went online and emailed their office immediately. From point of contact to following up after my surgery, this place has truly exceeded my expectations. Kaufman agreed to help me and remove the lumps and perform my breast lift/enhancement. I was really nervous, I mean this is a huge decision and could effect the rest of my life if it went wrong. They were so helpful and understanding. The procedure went great. Now ladies, while I was healing I was thinking the entire time my breasts weren't big enough. Honestly I was disappointed at first. I thought they were too small and where the incisions were I was terrified the scars would be forever visible on my fair complexion. This entire time my husband is reassuring me that they're perfect and look great, but I just didn't feel great. I didn't know about the drop and fluff! They really do settle down into the pockets and take on a fuller look. I was not thrilled until couple months before my 6 month follow up. By then they'd dropped and my scars are incredibly almost gone, in fact they will disappear completely with more time I'm sure. So if you are contemplating breast surgery or looking for a Dr you can trust look no further! It is more expensive than other surgeons, but I wouldn't be concerned with saving money when it comes to something so serious. While I was waiting for my surgery, Kelly told me they perform 8 breast surgeries a day! Kaufmans reputation is well worth every penny spent, if not more . They upgraded their building and their new office is beautiful. Thank you Dr Kaufman for taking such great care of me. Thanks to all the beautiful ladies in the office for all your help as well. You guys are the best there is hands down. 😁< /text>

Very friendly office staff,  warm and empathetic surgeon.  I was happy and well coached for all I went through (facelift and CO2 laser).
Was followed closely posted and am very happy with my results!
I was also thinking that Dr. Kaufman has the best of two worlds:  He balances his work between the "beauty" business and going on a ton of missions to help the less fortunate with a lot more problems!  I admire that.
And THANK YOU for the gift of thanks in the mail today!  Awfully thoughtful.   You are all the best!
Thank you Dr. Kaufman and your Staff!<//Text>

<Review>Dr. Kaufman and his staff have been amazing throughout my breast reduction/mommy makeover journey. He is truly an artist as well as a genuinely caring, approachable plastic surgeon. He and his team were always responsive and accessible for any post-surgical questions and/or small complications I had.
Dr. Kaufman has honestly changed my life - for 20 years I dealt with daily back and shoulder pain, deep grooves from my bra straps, and low self-esteem from my disproportionately large breasts.  They really were the bane of my existence - it colored how people viewed me as well as how I viewed myself. Now, I’m free to find clothes easily, exercise without embarrassment/pain, and feel more at peace.  Words cannot describe how grateful I am!< /Review>< pictures>

I have many compliments for Drs. Kaufman and Clark and their staff.  My procedure was with Christa Clark.  I consulted with her for about 10 minutes and knew that she understood what I wanted, so it was more fun to continue chatting as if she were my girlfriend, forgetting that she is a very busy doctor.   Compliments as well go to my nurse and anesthesiologist, also good chatting before surgery and absolutely the best.  As for my procedure, I received from Christa exactly what I asked her for.< /Text>

<Text>I recently had an abdominoplasty. Everything from the consult to the surgery made me feel confident in the process prior to my commitment.The surgery went very smooth - no nausea afterwards- which was a great relief! I never get an answering machine when I call-always a friendly voice. The office staff is available to answer my questions no matter how silly they seem. I had a few suture issues after the surgery and Dr. Kaufman and the nurses were on top of it and had me come in for more appointments to make sure everything was healing right. I am still under their care and feel confident that my result will be amazing! The professionalism and caring attitude of everyone in the office has been a tremendous relief for me. Thank you!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>My BBL /body contouring experience with Dr. Kaufman and his staff was extremely pleasant.  Everyone in the office was very nice and professional; Coutney the patient coordinator is awesome and answered ALL of my questions and NEVER made me feel like I was annoying ( i thought i was annoying because i bugged her so much ☺).    I am 7 weeks post my BBL journey and I am so happy with my results so far.  I definitely made the right choice when I chose Dr. Kaufman to perform my procedure out of about 5 different plastic surgeons; he changed my life!  I feel so much confident about my self and have better selfsteam;  Thank you Dr. Kaufman!
Would I recommend Dr. Kaufman? In a heartbeat!  If I decide to have any other procedure, it will be with Dr. Kaufman.  Love his professionalism; I give him 5 out of 5 stars.
See you soon Dr. Kaufman!☺<//Text>< Date>

I have always thought that people who have plastic surgery are either really rich or have to look really good for their job or both.  And if you can afford it... then what is wrong with getting a little help to feel your best?  However my surgery journey didn't start out that way at all.  I would say that I have always done my best to take care of myself and while my body was not going to be perfect I was ok with it the majority of the time.  Then I had the very unfortunate experience of encountering a life threatening infection called sepsis which left my mid section disfigured and completely "not me."  In order to save my life I lost several internal organs which resulted in a scar that resembled Frankenstein.  On my small frame the sight of it really took over my body and it was all that I could see anymore.  Also, my skateboarding muscles that I so heavily relied on were loose and uncontrollable resulting in me having to give up several sports (i could not balance).  After careful researching I came across Dr. Clark.  I began communicating with the doc and her staff on-line which for me was key because I am very shy and terribly nervous after surviving sepsis.  Dr. Clark and her staff reached out to me and made me feel so comfortable.  When I go into the office I feel like an old friend.  I am about 10 days out post op from my stomach revision or "tummy tuck."  So far I am so pleased with my results although I am currently going through swell hell right now which is completely normal for this stage of the process.  The surgery itself was such a breeze...I talked with Dr. Clark right there at my bedside and that is the last thing I remember...which was good for me!  Dr. Clark and her staff are turning my horrible sepsis memories into positive healing memories as a conclusion to my sepsis.  I have so much gratitude for the care I have received at this surgery center.  I felt completely safe, have a woman doctor, and am healing in a positive direction.  For me, it's the mixture that dreams are made of...but lucky me... it's my real life.  :)</text>

When I had suspected the rupture of an implant I reached out to those family/friends who had previous experience in the greater Sacramento area with Plastic Surgeons.  Dr. Christa Clark's name kept coming up repeatedly.  I called to get a consultation and lucked out and was able to get in the very same day on a cancellation.  Dr. Clark exudes the confidence to not only take care of the ruptured implant but to also use her experience to re-shape and bring symmetry to my breasts. I was scheduled within a month, everything went so smoothly and were easy to work with on my post -op appointments due to a hectic work schedule.  I have to say at 3 weeks post op and I'm liking the way they are shaping up and can tell you I look better than ever.  Dr. Clark did a fabulous job and would recommend her for any procedure.< /review>

I am about 4 weeks post-op now and though I have some pesky drainage remaining on my left abdomen, I know that this is part of my body's healing process.  I called once on the weekend for concern about the drainage initially and Dr. Clark promptly called me back after being paged.  I was then seen on Monday between his surgical patients and all was good.  I am an ICU nurse and would highly recommend this facility and Dr. Kauffman. One thing I admire about Dr. Kaufman is his charitable heart in helping children with disfigurements and his service during the Desert Storm in the Navy Seals.  He is a hero on many levels and he was able to help me as well.  I am healing well and wish others a great experience as well.</review></record></dataset><record>

I can't say enough wonderful things about Dr. Kaufman and his team.  I have been going to his office for the past 8 years. Although I have never had surgery,  I have numerous other procedures done.  I've had laser hair removal, facials, and some botox.  I have referred over 20 of my friends and family to his office for actual surgery and they have all "Thanked" me for referring them to the "BEST" plastic surgeon.  I would never go anywhere else!  They are AWESOME!!!!!!< /text>

Dr. Kaufman and his staff are the most patient, happy, and professional group.  I am beyond pleased with my procedure and results.  If your looking for a surgeon who cares from the heart, this is your M.D.< /Review>

After doing roughly a year's worth of research on plastic surgeons to fix my rectri-distatis, I found Dr. Clark. My initial consultation had me sold. Dr. Clark and her staff were beyond friendly and helpful. They explained all options that were available and all my questions. The day of the surgery she went over everything again and the surgery went perfectly. Now, 6 months later, I could not be happier and would recommend her to anyone.< /Text>

From the time I walk through the door until the time I check out everyone is so genuine and positive. The environment is so welcoming and friendly that it puts a smile on my face knowing I entrusted my surgery to people who genuinely care for each each customer as a patient and an individual.</Review>

<Time>1391716832511</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>The last procedure I have had done at Kaufman and Clark was my Botox touch up service. I love how every time I go in, the staff and especially Jocelyn, not only remembers my name and the last time I was in, but they also remember the things that we talked about in my last visit and ask how I am doing in general. The fact that the staff makes a genuine effort to take such good care of their patients, you start to feel like family. I strongly feel that the service they provide goes well beyond small talk and formalities. Every member of the Kaufman and Clark staff that I have worked with, and I have seen many of them, they each take a personal interest and have their own personality that adds depth and dimension and a generally well-rounded feeling of acceptance and being taken care of as an individual person and not as a medical reference number. I find myself trusting their judgment even more when sometimes they talk me out of some things and encourage other methods that maybe even less expensive or less invasive because they feel it is a better fit for me at that time. It gives me peace of mind to know that it's not all about the money and the biggest procedures they can talk me intoâ€¦ I genuinely feel that they care about the outcome and my ultimate happiness and satisfaction ahead of any other factors.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Every experience from phone inquiries to 6 month post op was a great one. I have always wanted breast implants; even more so after having my daughter. Things just went almost concave after breast feeding. I told the doc exactly what I wanted and my results far surpassed what that was. I just wanted confidence to wear women's clothing, to feel like I looked sexy when I looked at myself in the mirror. After 27 years I finally have that thanks to Dr. Kaufman. I can't remember the girl that I talked to on the phone the first time but she is what really one me over to actually go have a consult (when I remember I will update). I opted for a "virtual consult" first because I was still on the fence and having anxiety about going in. Basically they tell you to take pictures of yourself at different angles- I was skeptical at first but I figure it's natural(for now) human anatomy... she called me back the next day relaying the message that Dr. Kaufman was extremely excited and hoped to work with me, she shared her personal experience and really gain my trust in one phone call. Next was the pre-op appointment. In short they give you a bra far to big for your girls and give you implants to "try on" as well as a tank top to get the illusion. I was told at this appointment that I'd be luck if I could get 350cc high profile because of my lack of tissue. While I was getting prepped for the OR the Dr. came in the chat and I remember telling him the "bigger the better!" I am proud to say that no longer am I a member of the itty bitty committee because I have 380cc of high profile self confidence! I love them and I love the way I look in tshirts now because you don't have to see my face to know it's a girl wearing it! Thanks to everyone for making me feel at home every step of the way. For the record I did the "under boob" incision and got my implants under my muscle.< /Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>I have had a very bad experience with this company.  I was a first timer as far as any plastic surgery goes.  I chose Kaufman & Clark because of these reviews even though they are more expensive then other places.  First off I'll say that Katie did a really good job with my fillers.  After that it went down hill.  I made my appointment for two shots of Restylane and I added dysport while I was in the appointment.  I paid the my bill thinking it was more than I thought it was going to be but just figured I added wrong.  When I got home and looked closer at my bill it stated I received Perlane instead of Restylane. I had never heard of Perlane was but was charged for it which was more expensive.  I was quoted for Restylane, made my appointment for Restylane but charged more for something else.  When I called to explain this to the receptionist (Jackie) she was arguing with me that I received Perlane so I had to pay for Perlane.  I kept telling her I was quoted for Restylane, made my appointment for Restylane but she kept saying that I got Perlane so I pay for Perlane.  I didn't think that was right.  She said she'd have the coordinator review my bill and get back to me (then hung up on me).  Today I received a message from her stating that I will get $80.00 back (because that was also wrong on my bill, they did not subtract my consultation fee) but other than that my bill stands as is.    I called her back because she said on the voicemail that the down payment isn't changing (none of this had anything to do with the down payment).  I asked her to mail me the $80.00 and stated that I was no longer going to argue with her but this had nothing to do with the down payment.  It had to do with requesting a service, getting a different service without knowing and being charged extra for that service.  Her last statement was "it's good stuff".  Totally regardless of any point I was trying to get through to her.  She was rude, cocky and not someone I would hire to be in my reception area.  The thing about all of this is that both my partner and I were new customers and possible lifelong customers but because of Jackie and a small amount of money, we will not be back.  Good thing this is Folsom and there are plenty of very good plastic surgeons to choose from.  I won't recommend this place to anyone.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The GameStop I went to closes at 8:00 everyday except Sunday which closes at 6:00 or that is what I believed until I got there at 7:50 in which the store was closed and it said it closed at 7:00 instead at 8:00. Here's an advice just go to GameStop an hour before it closes or don't go at all.<//Review>

I dont know if it just me but game stop employees are so nice! This location aswell! Was luckly able to get there last soul eater funko pop. A little damage but nothing crazy or noticeable. Also a fire force and demon slayer shirt. They had a BOGO with the shirts so it was a pretty good price!< /Text>

<review>Great!! No, AMAZING customer service!!!  I was standing outside being helped and some of the customers these poor associates get (yelling, cursing, inpatient, just giving the associates a hard time) and they handled themselves so professionally!!! If you are giving workers a hard time during this pandemic!!! Go home!!! You have no business shopping!< /review>< rate>

Horrible customer service the manager Mrriya won't even exchange anything and claims because she'll lose money I told her I was gonna report her to customer service and she said go ahead I don't care she acts like she own's the store and acts like she's losing money for doing an exchange that's shows the kind of people gamestop hires for a manager they do whatever the hell they want I don't know where they hire these idiots from this the worst!! gamestop ever!!!<//Review>

<text>Mrriya is the manger here and she's is the worst of the worst. She closes the store about 5-10 minutes before closing time stands by the door and locks it and lets you know they're closed. When no they're suppose to close at the time they close not 5-10minutes before. And I let her know that it wasn't right and she said it's okay because she's the Manger she has bad attitude and abuses her power. Never ever aging coming to this Game stop.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

It was 5:57 and some short little female with a stick up her ass would not let me in to buy a ps4 headset. Told her I would only walk to counter and not stall and she still refused me entrance... store closes at 6 not 5:57...<//text>

Excelent food!!! The staff is so friendly and courteous. I was going to order flowers for my sister in law who was not feeling too good, but when I saw the total, I thought, she will be happier if I order food for her and the  family.  Sure enough, she was sooo happy and everyone at home enjoyed the delicious food.  Flowers are beautiful, but to see lots of happy faces and happy bellies is better. Let's think outside de box...</Text>

Delicious traditional Mexican breakfast! Pork is super super super good and having crema instead of sour cream is not only the correct way to do it but much appreciated :-)</text>

<Review>We only order delivery from here but it's the best.  I get the Chile Relleno burrito because it's insanely delicious every time. Never had anything like it.  My kids love the bean and cheese burritos kids meal- it comes with 4 mini burritos! I also LOVE their chicken strips appetizers.  They are these small crispy pieces that are exactly what I like. The food is delicious.  The order is ALWAYS right when it comes.  Always on time.  Delivery people so nice.  Just LOVE this place< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c27ed6e7523c25:0x40b5d505f2f12800<//GmapID></record>

<Text>I usually don't like to post bad reviews, but this place was just not very good.
My wife had heard that it was supposed to be good, so we went.
The ambience was very average, hole-in-the-wall, which I usually don't mind when the food is good. Too bad the food couldn't make up for it.
We got the chicken tortilla soup, a few soft tacos, a few crunchy tacos, and a quesadilla. Not one thing was close to being good, which is too bad. Could not even finish the food we got, it was just plain bad.
I honestly don't understand how this place is rated so highly. They use microwaves to heat up a lot of their food. I could do that at home and it would be just as good, or bad, actually.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c27ed6e7523c25:0x40b5d505f2f12800< /gmapID>< response>

Our waitress was more like family with her attentiveness and help (we had a baby and a toddler).  Will be coming here more often.</text></record>

They are consistent, reasonably priced, fast, and the food is good. It's one of the last places in the shopping center, and I hope it continues to thrive. If you stop in, try the carnitas burrito, and ask for it wet...its really tasty and quite filling.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>Highly recommend. Great Family business and recipes.  I'm hooked on the Carnitas quesadilla and bean and cheese burrito. Reading reviews I think I'll step outside the box and try the Carnitas or Chile relleno burritos next !!<//text>< Pics>

<username>William Leventhal</username><Text>I noticed this place when I went to use the ATM nearby, gave it a try and was impressed with what I found.  The grilled chicken and veggies plate was delicious,  the portion was generous and taste was good. The plate also comes with a small salad served with average and generic industrial supply, tasting dressing. The salsa bar was quite good with a nice tangy salsa Verde that was on the chunky side, and a hotter, roasted red salsa that also was very good.

I'll be hitting this place whenever I'm in the area for certain.< /Text>< Date>

Looking for a restaurant near Us on google maps, we found this restaurant. We definitely like it, the place is small but food was good, the restaurant looks clean and their customer service was great.

The one star missing it’s becsuse we couldn’t use the bathroom to wash our hands, they told us it was busy, we spend about 40min there and the bathroom door was still close. 🤷🏻‍♀️<//review>

I only came here for the Menudo and it was actually really Delicious. I personally only eat homeade becuase I dont trust eating menudo from just anywhere, but i give their menudo 5 stars. Definitely will be back. However my friend got the taquitos she said the were hard and stale. just FWI.< /Text>

It's really cute but the prices here are super high. I would suggest trying to find textbooks and other things elsewhere. The clothes are also very expensive. $30 for a regular t shirt, more for higher quality. Even a mug is expensive.< /review>

They do not have enough iClicker2’s for the amount of classes that need them. They removed the option of renting a new one and now force you to buy one for $55. It’s a remote with 4 buttons. Yikes.</text>

Clean, organized, fun store to visit! As members of the community, we consider the Wildcat store, yet another choice when looking for gifts, cards, books, CSUC clothing, and especially art supplies and electronics!< /Review>

Overpriced and the new emblems are terrible. This place used to be great when it was ran by the student body and not owned by a third party private organization. Don't support it and maybe they will be forced to go back to the old ways.< /review>

Everything one might need at a college store. Food, clothes, electronics. A little pricey for snacks but they do have quite a few options. Appreciate the location and people who work here.<//text>

< Review>
A cool University sponsored store to buy premium Chico State products.  The primary products available are authentic CSU clothing. You can also find everything a student needs for school,  such as CSU logo printed planners, high quality backpacks and professional grade office supplies (art/drafting) and related "office supplies." Expect quality and exclusive Chico State products and concordantly higher prices.  You won't find the words "value" "discount" or "sale"  in the Chico State Bookstore.<//Review>

Not terrible for what it is. Prices are low and there's a ton of CSUC branded clothing. Has cheap coffee, convenience store, and there's an authorized Apple retailer inside.< /Review>

Poor employee placement lines for purchasing were practically empty but the online pick up line had one staff member and took almost an hour to get through about 10 people. Most of the equipment is overpriced compared to any other store.< /Text>

Books are insanely expensive to both buy and rent, I was a freshman last year and you are required to leave the dorms on fridays before break, well of course I had multiple finals on friday and didn't have time to return the textbooks after the tests and before my shuttle for the airport took off. I had to make the decision to reach my flight and try returning the books a different time. I called the school to let them know what the issue was and instead of understanding the situation they put me in they had me pay a $300 fine for a $100 rental. My advice would be skip the store here and save yourself time and money on a alternative textbook site. Chegg and amazon are great places to start your search. (I understand that it was my fault not turning in the books before I left, I just thought the school would have had a bit of sympathy for a first semester freshman trying to study and get good grades, rather than sucking even more money out of me.)</text>

< review>
Ordered online. Was not informed that orders take several days to become available. I had done this to make pickup more streamlined and not have to wait in excessively long lines at the beginning of the semester. Instead, orders cannot be cancelled apparently, and after 3 times of arriving to pick up my products on different days, I've officially gotten quite irritated. The only options were wait or purchase in the store, then come back to the store to pick up the online order, then sell it back to the bookstore for presumably less than I had just purchased it for.

Very bad logistics systems in place for order cancellations and returns. In other commercial businesses the request to cancel an order before it's been processed or shipped is absolutely possible. There is no reason this canot be done at the Student Store, that I am aware of, other than lazy people putting the systems together or the profits being higher for not accepting cancellations.

Very disappointed. Will never purchase from the Wildcat Store again unless absolutely necessary or these systems are changed to reflect modern logistical and customer service practices.< /review>

Probably won't be buying my books online from here again. Both times I have come to get my books there was a long line and only one person working. Very frustrating to have to wait 30 mins plus to get my materials I've already paid for. Step your game up Chico State.<//Review>

Apparently Ridge Creek Management in all of their infinite wisdom decided to flag my last review so that it would be removed from google reviews. Well good thing I found it's gone so I can copy and paste it again for everyone's visibility and will continue to do so until everyone knows high intellect occurring here - thank you again free speech!!

This is not a review of the course - this is a review of the moronic choices that management decides to make - picture this - you get off of work and try to get in18 late in the afternoon. It's warm and you want to exercise so you decide to walk - as you hit the turn, you want to purchase water - but guess what - the restaurant is closed and you cannot purchase water anywhere - not in the pro shop, can't get water on the course because it's not potable and the faucets are shut off - GENIUS! How does management do it? How did they even receive that position? I wonder if mommy and daddy gave it to their family without a degree of common sense so that they can do something with their lives.

If you come, bring A LOT of water because you won't be able to purchase anything within a 10-mile radius after 5pm because management doesn't want to pay the additional $12/hr to keep someone in the restaurant - or have the foresight to buy water for the pro shop to keep on hand for people who would like to purchase some because more money is bad right?

I feel sorry for the employees there because if this is the level of intelligence that they are dealing with on a daily basis, I can only imagine what high-level genius ideas/rules management is coming up with that employees have to abide by. If anyone is interested, I can start a GoFund me so that we can give them more money to pay their employees to stay past 5pm or to purchase water for the pro shop because clearly the course is not making enough money based on the green fees that they charge.

Stop flagging my reviews just so you and other don't need to deal with the truth!<//Review>

For a good while this has been my favorite place in Dinuba to get breakfast or lunch and even drinks sometimes!! Absolutely love the customer service, the food is great, the drinks are great and the environment it’s very relaxing!! I highly recommend it, I love the fact that is more private than most places, it’s very clean and the staff is always very helpful and friendly!!< /Review>

< Review>
Played at a good pace today. BUT apparently we had hit into the group in front of us on accident once that we know of But a player drives back at us on the tee box and asks if we are in a hurry because we have hit into them 3 times now??? We were not aware. He had to make sure he told us he was the assistant pro which explains why his group was slow and we able to drive the carts on the aprons of the greens. It's our last day a Ridge Creek I'm sure we will be missed. Ha<//Review>

Horrible experience at Three finger jacks! Our food and drinks weren’t served to us in a timely manner! We waited over an hour for our appetizer! Then waited almost 2 hours for our food and when it finally arrived we were told the cooks didn’t see an item on our ticket so we had to take it boxed home! Over all bad service! We will never be going back there! Save your time and money not worth it. Sad thing is I’ve been there before and it’s always been a pleasure but this time did it for me!< /Review>

Nice course. I played in December and weather was great even if the fairways weren't very green. But the greens were in good condition and the setup is nice. It is a good course.< /Review>

Best choice on having the fireworks show here Thank You. THE staff were really good on directing traffic on the way in to the show but once get out it was a mess we couldn't back out do to everyone try to leave at the same time vehicles were make there own lane and block everyone exit it was really bad that the traffic wasnt move at all and no one was directing traffic any more.< /text>

Mother's Day Brunch. A nice variety of foods from breakfast dishes to dinner faves. They did a generally good job. Not too crazy about the flies hanging around all the desserts on a huge table. A bit pricey to my mind, and the $20 for a small pitcher of mimosa was a stretch too far.< /Text>

<Text>Best ribs I've ever eaten. Wife had the rib eye steak and she said it was amazing. We highly recommend this place for breakfast, lunch and especially dinner. Also the service is great and if your a golfer the atmosphere is fantastic. You can see all the action from the 9th hole while you dine.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Name>

It is a beautiful and challenging course but if you are not rich or if you don't drive a brand new Chevy truck the lady in the pro shop will treat you like you are the scum of the earth. Because of the condenseding way she spoke to me and hatred she had in her eyes while talking to me, I will never golf there again.

PS: the big guy that works the pro shop sometimes is the only nice employee I met during the  4 months I spent practicing there.< /review>

Great course! Greens were quick and read true, but soft and can hold a long iron no problem.. If you have a big fade/draw you are going to need some extra balls.. Played on a sunday, was 79$, worth every penny but you can find deals online to play for around 30$.. Fantastic food/clubhouse, will play again soon!</review>

<Review>This is my go to place since it opened in 2008.
I eat here, it's my running place. My husband is an emperor member but yesterday a cart person said that my German Shepherd bit one of of the cart boy's ankle.
I don't have a German Shepherd but he was adamant.
Lying employees?
I host many family members for Thanksgiving, Easter and mother's day. No more. Liars!< /Review>< GmapID>

Went out to celebrate a birthday, it was our first time at this place. Our waitress was not attentive to us and took long to take our drinks and order. Our food was cold when we got it. Other than that the place has a beautiful atmosphere.< /Text>

Food was really good. But waited so long before the waitress even came to take our order.  The other waitresses were so fast and served their tables so promptly. Our waitress  was not attentive at all.</review>

<Review>Great track,  very fair as far as playability.  No marshaling to speak of. Played as a single on an early weekday morning,  walked holes 3-9 behind a foursome without an offer to play through.  Waited on every hole. I don't blame inconsiderate players,  but a marshal should have waved me through. Giving 2 stars because as I walked off, pro shop comped me some range balls. 9 holes at 8am should not take 2.5 hrs</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>A-Town Diner is a trip back in time to the "Happy Days" with it's 1950's decor & walls filled with photos of hot rods and racers. But the real reason to is their  delicious, huge diner menu,  served in generous portions. All at very reasonable prices . Worth a visit.</Text>< Pictures>

This is one of the oldest shopping strip malls in Atascadero. Due to being set above El Camino all of their driveways are sloped up toward the parking lot making it difficult for larger vehicles and anyone with a trailer to have a hard time getting in and out of the parking lot. Otherwise it is a very nice, clean and well kept outdoor shopping space with some outdoor seating and a very nice variety of shops, offices and restaurants.</text>

It's seen better days.  It would be good if a couple of steady shopping stores would move in the better the place up.  Or the homeless would keep using it as a gathering to pan handle pizza.</text>

<review>Attempted name change by mail, failed on first attempt.

They DID return the passport, but they lost any record of ever having the application, and they didn't write a note about whether it was successful, a failure, and what the next step was.

There's no tracking number given.
There's no way to track the process online.

It sounds like chaos/incompetence is rampant in this office.</review><user_id>116053095629219655089</user_id><resp>None</resp><pics>None<//pics>< name>

I’ve tried countless times to call and schedule an appt just like the office says to do and no matter what I’ve done I can’t get through to a representative. I tried to come to the office in person and was told by security the only way to get an appt was to keep trying to call. Don’t say you’re lines are open from 9-4 if you aren’t taking calls.</text>

Today I spoke with a very rude individual who spoke to myself and my client in a very degrading and insulting manner. When I asked for her name she told me that she was located in unit 11. When I finished the call and called back to speak with a supervisor I was told that they do not have a unit 11 and that they did not know what I was talking about. I hope that call was recorded for training purposes and they DO NOT follow the way she handled herself. I will be following up.< /Text><username>kasia elijah< /username><Response>None< /Response>< Date>

<text>My family had just a great experience with this office! Nice building, friendly staff, efficient help! My special thanks go to Ben (I don't know his last name but he gave me his code C10) who helped us a lot with a renewal of our SSN. He was so kind, and smart, and willing to help that I would call him the best clerk I've ever met! He is a perfect role model to other workers! Thank you again Ben! You're the best!</text>< Resp>

Redirected over to this office to file my paperwork for a new card. Security was thorough but friendly and helpful. The wait for service was about an hour without an appointment which is reasonable. They had an Express lane for some but I didn't meet the requirements. The gentleman who helped me file my paperwork was efficient and supportive, getting me out the door in less than 5 minutes after talking to him. Overall a good experience with the SSA.<//Text>

Yes, it's true it took longer than I expected; arriving at approximately 10:45 and leaving about 12:15. It was their short day and no, I didn't have an appointment.  The door security personnel were very professional,   courteous,  and considerate.  I'm over 65 and was wearing boots that day, I also use a cane. So I could sit down to remove my boots, they offered me a chair. The SS office personnel were even more professional,  courteous and knowledgable. Jason, the person that assisted me, even called my home 3 days later, with information (of which,  I had never even considered), that turned out to be beneficial to me.  When I asked questions, they were very knowledgeable and provided the answers clearly and succinctly. I appreciate all of their effort.<//Text>

Second time here, both times I had to wait 40 minutes approx., 30 people before me, so, overall a good experience.

First time had to change a letter in a Social Security Card, an "a" for an "e", fast.

Second time, my status changed, so had to switch my Social Security Card for a new one without restrictions, again, fast.

So, can't complain, also the person who attended us was professional and kind.

Just go prepare and with an open mind, everybody's time is valuable.< /text>

The clerk at window 1 sent us away yesterday @ 11:00 a.m., stating we needed a birth certificate to apply for a replacement social security card.  A valid California ID was presented, yet we were still sent away.  The website indicates that birth certificates are not acceptable.  FIRE THIS CLERK< /Review>

<Review>I was very concerned after reading other review. I'm not sure if they were just going in for a new card as I was. My experience was excellent!  Got there about 9:30 a.m. on a Tuesday , security check went very fast,  did the electronic check in and it gave me my number. Only 3 people before me. Maybe a 10  minute wait. Then about  5 min to complete the process.  My husband and I left in shock at how smoothly it went.</Review>< Rating>

Lots of space and seating. I came in to have a replacement SSN card. The wait time is really bad. They could put in an extra or two employees at work to reduce the wait time, considering there are so many empty desks there.< /Review>

<Text>I went in to get my name change three different time.  Two this year. All representative told me just bring your passport.  This last rep said no to passport for name change. I even had my birth certificate.  I feel like guy is lying to me.  How come last i went the rep was going to change it but since i had 1 year passport they didnt want to change it  he said that the system will not accept 1 year passport.so i got 10 year passport.  They all lie< /Text></record>

<user_id>110656084184433078090< /user_id><review>Prepare to wait for a very long time. Once you get your number, you will be called in about 15 minutes. There you will give them your name and reason for a visit. Even something so simple as dropping off w-2s requires waiting, and expect at least an hour for that.
This time, you have to wait for your name to be called. Good luck listening for your name. Many of the announcers can barely be heard over the constant him of others waiting and even the louder ones are barely audible.
This all happens at the front office. If you are required to stop in there, plan out a whole day. If you are lucky enough to go to the rear location, plan on about 15 minutes.< /review><resp>None<//resp><date>1473373896004< /date></record></dataset><record>

The card center at his location is pretty good. It only took me 20 minutes from getting a number to completing my business. Of course, I would advise people to come early rather than late to avoid waiting in the lobby for extended period of time. The audio of calling your number is fairly easy to hear.<//Text>

So I try to call and try and try. The general SS number is 3 wasted minutes of auto answer blathering just to finally be told, "You have a 40 minute wait time.”  Calling the local office is a shorter auto answer leading to, "All reps are busy try your call again later"...and the system hangs up on us! 45 minutes of trying to no avail so now with daily painful disabilities including a new painful 'something' wrong with my brain, I have to travel far and dangerously just to ask where is the -Important- letter they said would be sent.

The so called security at the entrance are misogynistic and patriarchal. The so called security at the entrance talk down to women and treat women like an inferior. They should train their security guards not to discriminate against women. I'm from Orange County California and I'm also from Los Angeles California, and I've never been treated as badly at a Social Security Office until I came to the Social Security Office on Folsom Blvd. In Sacramento.< /Review>

<Text>Good evening,
My wife and I was upset when we found that my SS deposit was $ 504.00 instead of $1262. The  representative review my record. She explained that my 2014 SS was not paid correctly and SS owed  us $504. Next week on the 19th receiving $ 1262, next month it will increase $ 1290. She took her time and was VERY professional.
Representative took my call very close to 5:00pm wish I remembered her name. Please, manager or lead send or give her notice of a job " WELL DONE".

Sincerely,

Sean M. Kelly< /Text>< Rating>

A big ugly mean looking guy spotted me through the glass and I wondered if he was going to come around and kick my butt in a case of mistaken identity. It was my experience these poor people working there acted like THEY'VE ONLY EVER WORKED WITH THIEVES AND FRAUDULENT CRIMINALS who are there to abuse the system. I am scared to death of the place and the poor people who work there to "help" you. Opposite of the Roseville office and "Sue at window two" so to speak.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Horrible customer service. I called in on behalf of my grandmother to see if they had appointment time slots and she refused to give me any information and wanted to speak to my grandmother who doesn't speak English and is hard of hearing. I'm not even asking for anything that would require personal information. Horrible.< /text>< gmap_id>

<Review>So lame!!! I spent 45 minutes on hold while trying to contact this place and I got hung up on once. Finally when i got through I was told this location can help with changing my name on my SS card but once I got there I was told I have to go to another location. Now I have to go to the Folsom location tomorrow. Waste of time seriously especially since I have two little kids with me!!< /Review>< name>

We came in to look for a specific color and style dress for my daughter’s prom. We didn’t see what we were looking for so we left. There weren’t a lot of prom type dresses. The five star rating is because we bought my other daughters wedding dress there a few months ago. We had a great experience. The dress was beautiful and we got a great deal.<//text>

<review>I didn’t buy my dress at David’s Bridal but I had alterations completed there. My original seamstress was unable to create my desired look. I went to DB in hopes that they could fix my dress with only three weeks prior to my wedding. They exceeded my expectations. The seamstress Lucy was not only able to fix every detail of my dress concerns without me even highlighting my concerns. But when I returned for my dress I felt magical, like a true bride. The alterations department were friendly, efficient and skillful and I definitely recommend to go directly to them for all your alteration needs.< /review>< Pictures>

I was so nervous & excited because my wedding is in a short 6 months. Fayth was my consultant & she was incredible. I fell in love with the second dress I tried on & Said Yes To The Dress!! I wanted to do additions to the dress & was very specific on the type of veil I wanted & she nailed it!! Everyone was extremely nice & welcoming. I’ll cherish that experience forever & so thankful for Fayth & everyone there who helped make the experience for my mom & I so special.<//Text>

I had the best time at David’s Bridal! My original plan was just to get an idea of the style dress I wanted for my special day, but ended up finding the right one! I can’t thank Fayth enough for her help and constant encouragement throughout the process. Fayth made the process amazing and I’m so glad she was my stylist!<//text>

I am over the moon elated with my gown and with much thanks to Lucy for her alteration skills! After my initial fitting, my gown was not fitting as I desired and Lucy stepped in and recognized the alterations that were needed to create the fit I desired. I just had my final fitting and was brought to tears with the perfect fit of my dress. Lucy intently listened to my concerns and made it a priority to make it happen! Her care and concern was so appreciated and her alteration magic is amazing!!! Thank you so much!!!<//Review>

<text>This review is for Joanna (not sure of spelling). She is an absolute gem. She was able to accommodate myself and my sister and mother all in one appointment. We all vary in sizes and style preferences but she made each of us feel heard and prioritized. We were all able to find something we loved for our brothers wedding. Despite all of our back and forth she was incredibly patient and extremely helpful. Should we have another important occasion we will definitely be back.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Booked an appointment for a 30 minutes bridesmaid dress fitting and spent two well spent hours here. I just had to leave a raving review, the service I received was diligent, passionate and truly outstanding. I did not feel the length of time due to the phenomenal service! My options were limited and the lovely stylist spent so much time finding creative solutions that would make both me and the bride happy. She did not give up on me and I found the perfect dress! I’ve told the rest of the bridesmaid party this location is a must, I know they won’t be disappointed!!!<//Review>

Rozelynn was amazing! She was super responsive to all the things I was looking for and was super attentive. I'm usually not good with pushy sales representatives and she wasn't at all. She really followed my lead and helped me pick out what I was looking for. Would totally recommend seeing Rozelynn!</review>

I went in for my bridal gown. There was a great selection and some new Spring designs when I went (Feb. 2021). I picked out what I liked online before showing up. I was kind of bummed they didn’t have everything I liked in store but they had a good amount of options. I was introduced to a stylist who was taking place for my main stylist and she asked me some questions about the wedding and I felt like she was judging me because my fiancé and I have been together for 9+ years and we’re barley getting married but that was none of her business and I felt like she didn’t want to be there or help me. But when that lady left, I met my MAIN stylist and she was very kind, sweet and awesome, I think her name was Letty, so ask for her if you go! I did not feel rushed or pressured with her at all which was great. However, I was sad I only got to try on 5/6 dresses. Also, they mentioned I can only bring 2 guests which was fine because I wanted to bring my sister and mom only but when I got there I saw other people in big groups of 5 or more which was confusing especially if they are trying to limit the people in the store due to COVID. I felt that there were too many people inside at the same time during this time and I showed up for my appointment at 3pm but had to wait an extra hour (4pm) because it was really busy they had to clean up and get ready but that was fine I wasn’t in a rush I had a chance to look around at all the dresses. I did find the one and said “yes to the dress” at this location. I had a pleasant visit.< /Review>

<Review>I have to say, I was extremely impressed with the service at this specific location! I booked an easy appointment online on the same day and I had no issues. Once I arrived I was allowed to browse and moments later Natalie came over to assist me in my browsing and took over the whole visit. Need i say, she was absolutely phenomenal and her absolute professionalism yet very friendly character just topped this whole visit! Thank you so much Natalie, I found my bridesmaid dress on the same day with her help and patience! 🌹</Review>< pictures>

I like to Thank Valena, one of the stylist at David & Bridal. This was my first place to looked for my wedding dress and she helped me find the one. She was easy to talk to and patient as I was trying to find the perfect dress. Her inputs were helpful and made the search about me. She helped me find a dress that was best fit for me and it was within my budget. I would definitely recommend Valena to everyone.<//review>

My first visit was super fun, I went in on a Saturday and was getting married the next Friday, crazy I know! But none the less I found my dress, veil and belt.  The staff was super friendly, that made me feel great and so beautiful! I ended up spending $555 only everything including alterations, I didn’t think that was too bad! I love my dress very very much and they said the alterations would be ready by Monday. I went Online to check out the shoes, I found the perfect ones, I even went shopping to other outside stores and those shoes stuck with me, so I knew I’d be picking up a paid on Monday when I’d pick up my dress. I found the shoes in my size, they just had this yellow old glue stuck on the rhinestones and the glue used to stick on the rhinestones were super visible. I took them to the front to ask if they had more in the back, she said that was the only one they had and that there could be more at a different location, I knew if I left without the shoes I would not be happy so I said okay that I would still take them, already thinking how I can get the glue off them. As the first women I asked about the shoes walked to front register she pointed the glue out to the manager, the manager looked at her and said “they are already 20% off” something I wasn’t even aware of initially. The First employee that helped said “okay I didn’t tell her anything.” I could literally hear the first conversation behind the customer paying. I was thrown off as I didn’t ask for a discount or wanted a mark down for damaged shoes I was purchasing, I was gonna make it work because I knew I was the one with the crunch time. I just thought the way the manager handled the situation was very poorly, I didn’t want a discount but as a a manager and seeing the damage on the shoe, the money I had already spent on everything else, I think she could’ve maybe apologized and looked or called other stores. It wasn’t even about the money for me it was just on how awful she made me feel like I had been asking for money off. I think if I had been anyone else I could’ve easily caused a scene but I’m not that type of person. I will just leave my review here and take my beautiful dress.

Thank you</review>

This was my first experience with David’s Bridal and WOW what a great one it was!  From the moment we walked the service was welcoming.  I will admit I was very overwhelmed, but Leah my coordinator calmed me down and assured me it was all ok.  Not once did I rushed or pressured to try on or buy! She was very helpful and never lost focus. The extra touches she add or suggested were right on point.  At the end I did say “Yes to the Dress!” Thank you again Leah for all your help.<//Review>

The person that did the alterations, Lucy was great! Very helpful and gave us some great suggestions. However it was very, very warm back in the fitting area. I was disappointed in the lack of circulation and or temperature overall. You have women standing for 20/30 minutes with layers of fabric in 75+ degrees in the back didn’t make for a great experience. I was sweating and uncomfortable, very disappointed in that part. But the staff was friendly and helpful but the AC definitely needs to be something they keep in mind, or lack their off.</text>

I was very pleased by the service we received here at David’s Bridal. After booking an appointment to try on dresses, we were assisted by a nice lady who helped pick out different styles. The process ran smoothly and made the entire experience easy. Picking out dresses can be stressful but David’s bridal relieved some of that by guiding us. All 7 of us ended up walking out of the appointment with a dress order and alteration appointment. There was so many options when it came to both style and colors. For only $10 a mask to match your dress can be purchased. Thank you David’s Bridal!<//review>

They’re so disorganized! They ordered me the wrong dress. Told me it would be in one day so I came in for alterations. Turns out it wouldn’t be here until the next week so now I just wasted my gas. When the dress finally came in it’s the wrong size. And when I tried to return it, it turns out they have a 7 day policy. And if I did the alterations I would STILL get charged. Don’t waste your time here.< /review>

Our wedding party worked with the women at the Brea David’s Bridal. They were so generous with their time. We had some tricky issues with some of the girls living out of state and we had time constraints too and FAITH was so patient and able to find solutions. She also spent hours helping me with my mother of the groom dress. Her professionalism was much appreciated.< /text>

I greatly appreciated how accommodating the store was. I went in early and they were able to still see me. I got my dress to try on (perfect fit, because AMAZING! people work here) and was able to be out in 10 minutes! 10/10 would come back whenever I need another bridesmaid dress.</review>

I have been coming to this David’s Bridal for years now. For my wedding and my brothers weddings. They are always so helpful and don’t put their idea of what looks good on me. This time Rebekah helped my mother and I find dresses for my brothers wedding. It was very easy and she heard what we were looking for. We are all married now in my family but I sure I can use this store for other occasions.<//text>

The girl that helped me with the dress, Alyssa, was rude. She made me feel uncomfortable about my body and made me out to be fatter than I was. Why ask my pant size of you are going to size me up? It was such a disappointing experience. If it wasn’t for the my best friend getting married, I wouldn’t give them my business.<//review>

<Review>I bought my wedding dress at this location almost a year ago and went back for my fitting recently. I was assured by how many covid protocols they had in place. When I went in they checked my temperature and brought me to the fittings area. I was the only one getting fitted that morning and the seamstress wore a mask, gloves and a clear visor.< /Review>< pictures>

Bought a dress a few weeks back and had a change of heart after it arrived. Morgan and the rest of the team at Brea David’s Bridal were super patient and helpful with me! Morgan went above and beyond checking for multiple dresses and making sure I felt great about my decision. Exceptional customer service especially during these COVID times. Hopefully these girls get a bonus because it’s been one of the best customer service experience I’ve had in a retail store. Thank you!<//Text>

I love the alterations department! They have made multiple of my bridesmaids dresses fit like a glove! They do such a great job with alterations. They are also super friendly and cheerful too. Their customer service and craft are the reasons why I choose to have David’s bridal of brea to complete the alterations on my bridesmaids dresses over places closer to my house or that are cheaper.<//Text>

The tailor was rude and did not provide satisfactory customer service. I commented that my dress had minor imperfections in the chest area and the tailor told me that "steaming might help but it won't be perfect because there is a lot of fabric in the dress". She also seemed upset at me because I hunched over sometimes (unintentionally) when she was pinning up my dress and said "the dress will be messed up now because you didn't stand up straight". She also asked if I was from a specific country because she had customers from that country the day before, but that was irrelevant to the situation and I felt that assumption was a bit rude. I was also given a quote that hemming my dress would cost $160 when I purchased the dress on 9/26, however, when the tailor gave me a quote on 10/18 it was significantly more! I did not want to argue with her, but I felt like she overcharged me. This experience overall made me wish that I would have gotten my dress tailored elsewhere.

Update 10/20/20
The store manager gave me a call and addressed the issue. I'm very pleased with the way the store handled the matter and I look forward to picking up my dress from them! Thank you.</text><username>Vivian Wong< /username>< rating>

The girls here did everything they could to try and get me a bridesmaid dress on time since the wedding I’m in is being planned on such short notice. Everyone was so nice and professional, I just wish more styles were readily available and that manufacturing didn’t take so long. Thank you ladies!< /text>

<Text>What an excellent experience! All of the staff were so attentive. Our assigned stylist, Cori, was so cheerful, helpful, and had quality recommendations that improved our overall experience. I will definitely be returning to this David’s Bridals location in future! 10/10 recommend this David’s location to anyone who wants to make the wedding process fun and a little easier on themselves.< /Text></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>My Daughter needed a dress for an event and we were cutting it a bit short because the event is coming up soon.  Our consultant Fayth was wonderful!   She went through the trouble to see which dresses we could order and have altered in time.  She asked us what we needed, what my Daughter was looking for, and paid attention to her response to each dress she tried on.  I was in panic mode and was thinking maybe we could find a dress off the rack in a 2nd-choice color or size and just make it work.  I found that Fayth was knowledgable and experienced, willing to work to find solutions if we had to take that route. At the same time she didn't push my Daughter to settle on something she wasn't really happy to wear.  I really appreciated that.  In the end we found something my Daughter loved that could be ready even though we were late ordering; one that Fayth brought to us in the dressing room.  We weren't even with her and she found the perfect dress for us!  She was listening and she genuinely wanted my Daughter to be happy. We were happy and relieved when we walked out.<//Review>< Pics>

Made an appointment today to come in and try on a couple of wedding dresses I saw online and got Jasmine S. as my stylist. I really was not sure of what I wanted at all and she was so incredibly helpful without making me feel pressured at all (I’m pretty introverted). In the end I really liked one style but wanted lace and she actually found the exact same dress but in chantilly lace! It was so perfect. I honestly didn’t think I would end up finding a dress today but now I have the perfect one thanks to her. Thank you so so much to Jasmine for being so thoughtful and kind. Anyone coming here I would highly recommend Jasmine S. as she was very respectful of my wants, my worries, and my budget. Overall, a fantastic experience. Thank you!< /review>

<response>None< /response><text>David bridal is great for alternative types of dresses and for different types of body types. What they fail to do is tell you everything that they offer comes with a price, obviously everything comes with the price but they need to tell you in advance. But my dress they scheduled an appointment for a alteration all I needed was a small hem in the front after placing all pans that were necessary they gave me a ticket saying OK that’s $200.

I understand nothing comes for free but at least you need to give a girl a heads up of how much a small alteration would cost so that way she is not blindsided when she comes in.<//text><gmapID>0x80dcd56ef973fb4d:0xf620e3821269b8eb<//gmapID>< Pics>

<Review>Patty made our experience a delight to work with. She  was very knowledgeable about all of the styles and and colors of the dresses.  She is definitely someone I would recommend to go to . So I rate her a 5.
Overall experience with the other staff was 3 Our wedding party felt like there were treated differently then the other parties there.  The Manager was not really engaging with us just telling everyone to keep distancing. Even though we all had appointments. One of the girls seen another party of 7 walk right in and they didn’t distance but they were never told anything, which made our bridal party feel like they were been singled out and that is no way to treat any one .<//Review>< pictures>

From the first day I called about a special gown that was like searching for a Unicorn,  Jucinda & Leah and another kind and very helpful person , gave exceptional customer service over the phone & in person! Always willing to help, and going the extra mile for it. 😊 Thank you, ladies!
After finally going to my appointment [after 4 days of scheduling it, which btw it was good timing], meeting those ladies and Rozelynn,  again, very helpful,  pleasant,  and resourceful.  Rozelynn suggested great ideas for a veil, flower crown, etc. She was also informative about the different colors & styles for my Maid of Honor dresses.
I went to the Brea location for 1 special gown that they had in stock that no one else had in my local area of San Diego county. Feeling blissful that I found it, in great condition and in my size, for an awesome clearance price too! Basically original price was $958, after going down 2 prices, I paid a little over $499. Cannot beat that for my dream wedding gown.
Thank you for my making this memorable moment a great one, Rozelynn. Hope to see you ladies soon. I'm definitely recommending this location to all my friends/family.</text>

This location was great, they had a ton of selections of bridal gowns to choose from. Rozelynn was my stylist and she was amazing! She knew exactly what I was looking for when picking dresses for me. Some I picked out and some she picked out and she did a great job with that. You can definitely tell she knew about dresses and was very knowledgeable about them, which helped me out a lot. She was also great with helping me taking pictures and helping us hold the phone so my aunt and uncle could watch me on Facetime. That was so sweet of her. She had the best attitude and customer service and made me feel special as a bride to be. I told her I wasn't having a great day that day but she turned it around. Go to this location and ask for Rozelynn! :) There was a floor manager there, I am not sure of her name but she was also really nice and helpful as well. And since it is Covid, I did feel safe. We all wore masks the entire time.</Review>

It was great! Zandria was very helpful and honest. I appreciated her effort and patience with me! She helped me pick out some dresses that fit my body type. I was dreading going dress shopping because I'm plus size but she made me feel comfortable. Overall it was a pleasant experience because of her.</Review>

We were assigned a stylist by the name of Patty who was wonderful and very helpful. She is the one I’m giving the 5 stars to.
Our wedding party keep on being harassed by the manager and a few staff members saying they were to closed when we were in groups of three.
We also seen a group of 7 girls come in and never was told to stand outside or distance themselves.
This shouldn’t have never happened at all and the way they made us all feel was inexcusable.</text><name>rachelle castillo< /name>< user_id>

<rate>1</rate><Text>This review is for the alteration department. I came in today to see how much alterations would be and the woman that assisted me was absolutely rude. My wedding party was not allowed to be there with me while there are multiple people standing against the wall for other parties. Since I was unable to be with my wedding party, I put my dress on and went out to show them my dress. She went out and immediately was like you cannot be out here, rushed me back in and told me to walk. Where am I walking to? She was behind me. I don’t know where I was going. There was already a bride and I wasn’t aware there was room on the left of her. She was just rattling out prices. My mother in law asked her what would be the total. The woman responded by saying, “I already gave you the numbers.” The woman’s assistant handed her a calculator to total the numbers you rattled off. The total was more than my ceremony and reception dress combined. I told her I would think about it and she just dismissed me. I understand she does this for a living and I am going to get married only once. I would appreciate for her to go through the prices of what she is doing to my dress and slow down to ask me what I would like to alter. What is my vision of my dress? Nothing was asked. It was like she just wanted to move on. I was a waste of her time. It was a horrendous experience. Even if I wanted the alterations, I would NEVER work with her.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

My experience at this store was fantastic. Jasmine was my consultant and she had the greatest personality! I went in having a few dresses in mind that I wanted to try on. Once I was checked in, the manager showed me to the catalog area where I could look at more dresses. After a few minutes Jasmine came over and pulled the dresses I was interested in. I tried on 3 dresses and within 20 minutes had picked the dress! She offered to help me in and out of dresses, but I had my cousin do it for me because I felt more comfortable. Overall the shop and workers were all very nice and accommodating. The only thing I did notice was that it was very warm in there with little circulation of air.< /Text>

<Review>This was my first dress shop that I visited in my search for a wedding dress. The online appointment is very convenient and I was helped out by Jasmine when I arrived for my appointment. She was very helpful in selecting the dresses that I have in mind. I like that she wasn't pushy about making a sale and was more about giving me tips and advices. I am still in the process of narrowing it down, but if I am going to purchase my wedding dress at David's Bridal, I'm going to request Jasmine as my stylist again. Great experience!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I am the maid of honor for my best friends wedding and Valena was our consultant. She was so helpful, thoughtful, and has great customer service etiquette both times we visited the store. She provided amazing feedback and was great through the whole experience. The store manager Candice was also great and accommodating both times we visited. Both Candice and Valena made our experience magical and made the bride feel comfortable the whole time.</Review>

However I left as happy as can be. Jasmine helped me find a deal that I had not yet seen online in a color that will work wonderfully. She was able to take my situation and make the turn out even better than I thought it could be—with a dress that I really like for a price a lot less than I was expecting to pay. Thank you so much Jasmine!!!<//Review></record>

<text>I went in for my first bridal fitting during CoVID. Masks were required to enter the store. I was greeted by the floor manager and was brought to all their dresses and asked me to pick the ones I like while waiting for my stylist. The dresses there looked like it has been touched by so many people because it looked dirty/dusty. The stylist came and saw that I updated my profile & chose the dresses I picked online. She brought me to the dressing room & handed me undergarments to wear. I looked at it & it was so obvious that these have not been washed because it was lined with dirt & has someone else's hair on it. I thought they would be more vigilant about the situation with CoVID but I had to leave after trying out 3 out of the 5 dresses. Im not sure i will be coming back again.</text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Jasmine and Anna made my visit with David’s Bridal go so smoothly! They certainly took the stress out of this part of my wedding plans. Thank you Jasmine for your kindness and patience on helping me choose my dress, my mother’s and my sister-n-law’s dress. Thank you Anna for your kindness and patience with my alterations for my dress! I know my dress will be beautiful. I can’t wait!
Te lo agradezco mucho Anna, como le dije, tengo 120% fe en el trabajo que vas hacer con mi vestido. Si mirando mi vestido con sólo los broches ya estaba perfecto, no puedo esperar hasta que se hayan hecho las modificaciones.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Had an appointment on March 14 for Bridesmaid dresses. Tina was our consultant and she was so helpful and informative. We were getting pretty overwhelmed with the number of dresses available based on style and size. But Tina made sure to only show us dresses that would arrive on time so we weren’t wasting time or falling in love with dresses we weren’t able to get in time. After a long period of going back and forth between some dresses we made our selections and ordered right then to make sure we have enough time to also do any alterations if needed. Tina was seriously amazing, very patient, positive and kind. If it was any other consultant they would have hurried us along but Tina definitely was accommodating. Thank you again Tina!<//Review><rate>5<//rate>< pics>

My color palette is a little different so she pulled other dresses with the other colors to match the new colors we were getting. It made it so easy to choose colors. She was also very accommodating on the styles my bridesmaids wanted to try on.< /review>< Time>

There were not many dresses to choose from. Lots of them were tried on so many times the buttons and zippers were broken so I was not able to even try the ones I picked out. A lot of dresses on clearance was so dirty on the bottom I wonder if anyone would  buy them. I don't think I can find a simple well made dress there unfortunately.  Lots online were final sales and the sizing is not consistent from dress to dress. I got stuck with a couple dresses that I will have to donate brand new since they won't allow return or exchange.<//Review>

<Review>I went in with not to high of expansions, what with the budget i have. Looking around myself i wasnt finding much. Tried on a few i found, wasnt overly happy. Then my consultant came back with one to try on i didnt see. I liked it, was almost exactly what i wanted. Tried it on and it was even my size. It fit about perfect. I did not expect to walk out of there with a dress 40 mins in to the appointment but i did. I said yes to the dress. I found the right one with the help of the davids bridal staff! Thank you sooo much for taking the time and finding my dress.
Had alterations today.so far loving how it will look. Brea store's people have been wonderful. Cant wait till final fitting</Review>< user_name>

It was my first time at this location and I was in and out within 15 minutes. Everyone was so accommodating. Sandra, who assisted me, was very gracious and knew exactly what my size was just by looking at me. She gave me two sizes to try on and the first size she gave me fit to a tee! Would definitely be coming back to this location and recommend it to others!<//review>

Everyone is very friendly at this location. My consultant was Valena P. She's the sweetest ever. She took her time with me even though we were on a time limit and could only try on 5 dresses. She found veils and belts to accent the dress lovely. Thank you Valena for being so patient with me and helping find my dream dress for my special day.</Text>

Hi have to say this store deserves a five star rating. I cane in without an appointment and within 15 minutes a had an awesome stylist  named Dominique.

She was so nice and easy to work with. She went out of her way to find the perfect cathedral veil with crystals that I saw online.

Dominique is the best she’s honest and works very hard to find the look you want.

I highly recommend this bridal shop!

This was my first time visiting this David’s Bridal location in Brea and it went so well! Even amidst the new COVID safety guidelines, my guests and I felt safe and the staff were so kind and helpful. These women don’t waste any time. Which is perfect when you’re only given an hour appointment time to try on as many dresses as possible. I was fortunate enough to have Rozelynn as my stylist and with her expertise and patience, she helped me find “the one”! I’m not one that enjoys the spotlight and likes to keep things simple so these kinds of things make me nervous, but she made me feel so comfortable. Definitely would recommend her as your David’s Bridal stylist!!<//text>

<Review>I am so happy I came to this location to buy my wedding dress. I made a reservation super easy on the website and showed up bright and early on Friday morning. When I walked in, I was greeted promptly by an associate that said for me to browse  around to find what I like and don’t like. I hit their sale rack because that’s how I role and I knew the price I wanted to spend. I was then greeted by my wedding dress stylist, Cori. She was an absolute pleasure. She worked soooo hard for me. Pulled all the dresses I saw online, and all the dresses I wanted to see off the sale rack. She had my room prepared for me with shoes, dresses, under garments. She helped me in and out of every dress and she made me feel beautiful in every dress. She took her time with me and made me feel comfortable. She helped dress me from head to toe. I am so thankful for Cori and I’m even more happy that I bought my dress here at David’s bridal. Thank you Cori! I will definitely tell my maid of honor, sisters, and future bride friends about David’s bridal and Cori’s unforgettable customer service.</Review><name>Bernadette Green</name>< Pics>

<Text>This is my second time coming to this location. The first  time I came with an appointment. While the salesperson was nice enough she was in a big hurry and I felt she was trying to hurry me along in a nice way. She was still pleasant overall. 2nd time  I came in without  and appointment and had a better experience overall, even though the salesperson  was still very busy with multiple groups.

Would definitely come again and try to schedule when it was slower with an appointment.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I had great service from the time I picked my dress all the way to getting it altered.  I was impressed by how fast I got my wedding dress and bridesmaid dresses - the turnaround from when I ordered the dresses was incredibly fast (<2 weeks).

Ana D. from alterations is a gem!  She's very knowledgeable and so personable.  I had 3 fitting appointments altogether and each was a pleasure b/c of Ana.  She honestly knew what was best for me when I tried on my dress.  I thought I didn't need to get it let out but she was right - having my dress let out even a little was a life saver since wedding stress weight is no joke.  I got quick appointment times and never had to wait.  Ask for Ana in alterations if you can to get your wedding dress altered.  You won't regret it!<//text>

I had a wonderful dress fitting today that turned my experience completely around in regards to alterations.

I felt my first two alterations appointments didn’t go as well as it did today, only because Letty really listened to what I was trying to say in regards to the fit and was the first of the 3 who agreed that the fit wasn’t correct in the bust instead of making me feel like I was overreacting. She took her time to help me and I left confident that my dress will finally come out how I was hoping it would.

Thank you Letty!!</text>

Jasmin is the most AMAZING bridal consultant at the David's Bridal Brea location! She helped me sexy my perfect dress! She and her team we're warm, friendly, and hospitable! She never pressured me into trying on anything I didn't want to, and she was humbly honest with me when I asked for her opinion. She offered the perfect accessories, such at tiaras and veils, to match the dresses and gowns I was trying on! She truly made it a wonderful and memorable experience!< /review>

It was lack luster and unceremonious.  There was no chair to put my clothes or purse on in the fitting room. I had to put them on the floor. The fitting room was just that, i dont think it even had a mirror inside.  I was not really given any suggestions on dresses. I was told to look thru the samples, which were haphazardly hung and dirty.  It felt like i was shopping for clothes at any retail store.   Which left me uninspired and not looking forward to find my perfect wedding dress.   Ordinarily i dont complain much, however finding your wedding dress should be exciting and a special experience.  And this was neither.< /Review>

Such a good experience! My sister-in-law and I went bridesmaid dress shopping without an appointment and Candice was so nice to us and was able to accommodate us! Even though she was the only one there and there were a lot of people, she managed to make sure we were helped thoroughly and answered any questions we had.</Review>

I was helped by Jasmin this morning. She was able to locate the styles and colors I wanted. Even if the style wasn’t there, she was able to find something similar to give me a good idea. The store is clean, well stocked and the employees are really helpful. I will definitely recommend to my girlfriends!</review>

<review>This was my 2nd time at David's Bridal in Brea. First time was in Feb 2020. I tried on 4 or 5 dresses and could not find the right one.  I had one favorite but wanted to try on a few more, just to be sure. Well, Covid happened and i wasn't able to come back till July 2020.  I had Valena helping me this time.  She was very polite and Very Helpful.  I informed her that I had some favorites marked on my David's Bridal page. This made it easier to her to pull the dresses, I highly suggest doing this.
After trying on 4 dresses she knew I was stuck on the dress from last time and this one I really liked from this visit. So she had me try on both again and told me what was special about each dress and what alterations I'd need, I'm a petite size person.
Then she asked me a few very important questions. Which dress is ME. Not what others think, what i see and feel is Me. Then which would I be most sad/devastated if I was told it was no longer available. This helped me decide on the dress i wanted. My dress. Thanks to Valena I said YES TO MY DRESS!  Thank you Valena for all your help, your patience and great advice!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Angelica was simply amazing. As a plus size bride I was very hesitant to go visit a stylist better yet try on dresses out of my comfort zone. Not only was Angelica careful not to invade any personal space she also made sure I was comfortable each step of the way. She also suggested a style of dress I hadn’t even considered that ended up being the very dress I bought. She didn’t hesitate to try and find jewelry that matched as well. She was simply incredible in every way. Thank you for finding my dress for my big day and making me 100% comfortable every step of the way. I couldn’t have asked for a better stylist, dress, or experience! Thank you.</Text></record>

Everyone from the beginning of my purchase of the wedding dress down to final fitting, has been wonderful.

She was organized and very intentional about whether or not I would be able to order different dresses with my timeframe, so it made the experience go so smoothly.  I literally only had to try on 2 dresses and the second one was perfect.  David's Bridal Brea is a great representation of the company.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Sophia, at the Brea store was great very patient, understand of my needs. I never felt pushed to make up mind, if fact I was invited back because I couldn’t make up mind between two dresses. Needless to say when I went back I made up my mind and got my dress!

Thank you Sophia<//Review>< Pictures>

My experience was ok but I would definitely say the customer service could have been better. Due to Covid 19 things were different and I can accept that there are new protocols but they could have done better at making my experience as good as it could be.  They made a big deal about distancing and only taking a limit number of appts so I thought the consultant that was working with me would only work with me but that was not the case. Soon after starting she said she had to go help someone else and I was kind of left wondering what to do. We were only allowed to be there for 1 hour so I began trying on the dresses she pulled and she checked in here and there but I really felt like she did not spend the time she should have with me. She also asked me on at least three occasions "what's your name again" because she kept forgetting what she was supposed to be getting for me and had to check her iPad but then forgot my name. Lastly she told me I would get an email with all the dresses I tried on so I could look over them, I never got anything probably because she cant remember my name again.<//review>

I had the pleasure of having Jasmine as my stylist. It was my first time trying on wedding dresses and i wasnt sure how it would go or if id even find anything. I was open to different styles, but Jasmine was helpful in picking out dresses that would compliment me most. She quickly noticed what i liked and didnt like and did such an amazing job at finding dresses i ended up loving. I'm so happy and thankful for all their help!!</Text>

<Review>Was iffy about going into another dress fitting since the first one in Costa Mesa was horrible. But this location was perfect. The consultant actually listened to which styles I like and adjusted accordingly during the fitting within my budget. I was not planning to buy a dress, only wanted to window shop. The wonderful consultant brought out a beautiful Vera Wang dress within my price range. Couldn’t resist and bought it!! Thank u guys so much!! Also the floor manager was very sweet and understanding. Even tho it was a clearance dress, they went the extra mile to fix a stuck zipper/ tear lacing. I would totally recommend ppl to come to this location for their bridal experience. David’s Bridal in Brea, goes above and beyond for their clients <3 I appreciate you!</Review>< username>

<review>Sophia at the Brea location was amazing!!! She got my style after meeting me for 15 mins, helped me to narrow down what I like or what I am going for. I have been to 3 different places and she was the only one who could make me smile with her pulling dresses for me. I was about to give up with frustration since the other places were not able to help me. She was super nice and patient as well.</review>< gmapID>

Getting the bridesmaid dress I needed was a breeze. The girl that helped me was awesome. Pick up wasn’t so great. I wasn’t notified when the dress came in, then when I called to check was told I needed to pick it up by the next day. I had to speak with a supervisor to get an extension. Also, I needed the dress pressed upon pick up because the event was near and I wouldn’t able to make it back beforehand. When I ordered, I was told no problem! When I called for pick up, I was told they don’t do that for special order dresses... Again, spoke to supervisor who agreed to press the dress but wasn’t thrilled about it and suggested I bring the dress back closer to the event date...</text>

< Review>
Candace was amazing. I didn't have an appointment and they had two brides the stylist was helping so I just went about on my own.  I was looking for a dress for a gala which was 80s prom themed. Not an easy task. I was just about to settle on a dress  and try to make it work just to get something but Candace insisted she was going g to take one more look around the store herself. She found the perfect dress and on clearance! It fit perfectly and was  the perfect color. She even steamed it. I also found another dress for another occassion that she had to call another store to find. She made sure it was in good condition and arranged for it to be shipped to me. She was very knowledgeable, pleasant and patient.<//Review>

I just needed my mother of the bride dress hemmed. I went there to pick it up, tried it on again and the hem was 1" above the floor in the back (perfect) but laid 2" on the floor on the sides and front. She remeasured and  pinned it. She apologized and said she didn't know how that happened. They'll redo it and it'll be ready in a week. Glad I didn't wait til the last minute to have it hemmed.<//review>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>Two names: Leah and Kennedy. AMAZING. I bought my dress a while back when I was quite a bit smaller (for health reasons) but wasn't able to wear it before my husband got deployed. Fast forward to last week, I called the store, explained my situation and asked if there was any way I could exchange (not return) the dress for the same dress in a different size since it was still new with tags. I spoke to Leah and she said absolutely they could help me out. I made an appointment to get my new size. I went in to my appointment and was helped by both Leah and Kennedy. Unfortunately, the dress I originally got was recently discontinued so I had to explore other options. They were both extremely patient and helpful with me trying on 3 or 4 different dresses. We finally found the one and it is PERFECT. I'm so thankful they made the exchange so easy and now I am so excited for my ceremony in September. They even helped my mom pick out a dress for my day! Thank you to Leah, Kennedy and the rest of the team at this location for being so helpful during our visit! I recommend anyone in the Orange County area go to this location for their dresses and accessories.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dcd56ef973fb4d:0xf620e3821269b8eb<//GmapID>< name>

The worst place
They don't have a good selection on Bridesmaids or mother of the bride dresses everything is out dated and old looking .i wasn't allowed to look for myself . and the dress that you do like they don't have a size for you to try on it sucks . Go to Downtown Los Angeles they have many bridal stores and low prices.<//Review>

Came in.  Had an appointment.  I explained to the person helping me (whose name I never got until she handed me her card at the end) my role in the event, where the wedding was taking place, the colors I needed and showed her some things I found online (on the DB website).  She brought me 3 dresses of different sizes (one a size 10 though I am a 16/18).  She never came back.  I went out and asked her about another dress and she brought that to me.  I found 1 that was acceptable.  Although there were other sales associates in the store, she seemed to be the only person helping anyone.  When I was done, I asked for samples of the colors I needed , to which she could not find a color, so I had to find the dress color in the racks myself, as she was still helping others.

She gave me a card with the information on it, however, I will not be back to purchase the dress, as I felt like I did not get any personalized service even though I made an appointment.< /text>

<Text>Going into this experience I didn’t think I’d find “the one”. Yajaira isn’t amazing and made me feel so special. I was able to show her my favorites from dresses I saw online, she brought a few options over and the 3rd dress I tried was the one. She really made the experience special for my mom , maid of honor and I. Highly recommend this location and working with Yajaira!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Went in today to try on bridesmaid dresses. My bride had already picked the styles. Gave the item numbers to the lady at the front counter she immediately set me up with a consultant named Dominique. Dominique pulled the dresses right away and got me into a dressing room. She helped me with all three styles, one of which was quite difficult, user error on my part... She was very helpful by getting the correct sizes for me in all three styles because heaven forbid they all be the same. Once I decided on the dress she had the correct color ordered and charged for me right away. Totally helpful and pleasant interaction today thanks so much!</Text>< username>

<Text>I found my dress at the Brea location and it was so easy and relaxing. The dresser who helped me, Tina, was so patient and easy to- finding THE dress was so easy with her help. I would definitely recommend anyone to this location and would recommend Tina to anyone. I can’t wait for my final fitting! So happy to have said “yes to the dress” at David’s Bridal.

Update 6/20: Alteration appt went very well and seamstress wore a mask. Store itself was a little unorganized and had a few people browsing, but everyone was required to wear a mask and kept their distance.</Text>< Pics>

Natalie is AMAZING!! I came here for a bridal appointment and Natalie hands down blew my appointment out of the water. She listened to my wedding theme and preferences and picked out the best dresses! I know it’s not everyone’s experience but the very first dress she put me in, is my wedding dress! Can’t recommend her enough, she’s the best.< /text>

As the bride my wedding dress purchase experience was great overall but I must point out how fantastic Elena in alterations is.My dress is fitted and must lay just right. When we arrived for my first fitting a different person helped us and the dress wasn't fitting well at all so we came back the next day to meet with Elena.  She took the time to be sure my sister knew exactly how to get it to lay perfectly and its beautiful.  Thanks so much for taking Elena and for your sweet commitment to making sure everything will be perfect for me on my wedding day. Without you taking the time with us  I truly dont know how it could have worked.< /Review>

The store also was really warm at it was only 1030 am. I finally was helped by someone but I knew the bridesmaid dress I needed so I pointed it out. Tried it on and purchased. And I just got an email that I missed my appointment? So if you are a bride wanting a special experience, go to the store near the South Coast Plaza<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I was feeling uneasy and overwhelmed about dress shopping until I met Stacy. She was kind and knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable during the whole process. She even talked me through my decision and gave advise on how to politely handle my bridal parties opinions. I am so lucky to have been paired up with her. Stacy I hope you get to read this. I appreciate you so much. You have a great eye for this and your customer service skills are top knotch. To the management team of Stacy- give that woman a raise and never let her leave. She is the ideal associate you want to represent your company. ❤️<//text>

Everyone at David's Bridal has been so amazing.  After deciding I didn't like the first dress I purchased elsewhere.  I came to David's Bridal with only 3 months to go before my wedding worried that I wouldn't find anything that I liked that I could get in time.  I found a beautiful dress and my consultant was lovely and professional (sorry I can't remember her name.)  I've already had my first fitting.  I wanted something a little different done to the dress and Ana, Maritza and Rebecca in Alterations all put their heads together to find a solution .  I can't wait to see the final product and wear it on the day of my wedding November 9th!  In between my two appointments, I've been in the store to purchase accessories and every person who has assisted me has gone above and beyond.  Thank you to all of you.

<Name>Julie Kimball<//Name><date>1530757887861</date><rate>5<//rate><text>Jasmine was my stylist for my wedding appointments. I went twice. She was extremely friendly and really good about dealing with the crowd I brought (8 people both times). She was really open and honest and I felt comfortable asking her about how pricing and paying for things worked. No one in my family had ever gone through the traditional route of buying a dress. My mom and aunts had all bought off the rack. I was really nervous just because I didn’t know what to expect. I would recommend trying on the dresses with their undergarments. They offer them for a reason. She was really fun and brought me tons of veils and tiaras to try on with my dress.<//text>< Pictures>

I had a wonderful experience the day I tried it on with Corey a month ago HOWEVER picking it up today was not great. The woman at the front desk Stephanie informed me how the manager decided to take in a bunch of brides who did NOT have an appt like I did which got in the way of me being assisted properly. I was then set up with Rozyln who barely helped me put the dress on in fact she just assumed I could button 16 buttons myself and put on the dress myself that my mother is the one that helped me. When I came out of the dressing room, rozylyn was gone even though she said “I’ll be right here if you need me.” Corey helped me put on the shoes, helped me with EVERY SINGLE dress fitting, but none of their stylists today had proper time for me. Also their seamstress had about 5 minutes for us and then had to attend to someone else. I’m definitely not coming back here for my alterations for my dress or my bridal party. After spending over $1400 on my dress, I’m beyond appalled with their lack of service. Clearly they care more about money than the service.<//Review>

Not very helpful. The lady who helped us didn’t seem that interested. And when they didn’t have the right size, they didn’t help us contact another store. She said “it would be easier if you called yourself”. Some dresses were dirty. Had to look for most dresses ourselves.< /Text>

Leah and Jasmine were absolutely amazing! This was my first time trying on a wedding dress and I picked one! They were both very helpful and made the experience so easy. I have put this off for so long just because I was so nervous and it went perfectly. I found the dress of my dreams, the experience was super comfortable and not at all as scary as I imagined it. Go see Leah and Jasmine! You wont regrett it. Thank you ladies! A big weight has been lifted of my shoulders! I am one happy bride to be!</Text>

<Text>Our consultant Rebecca was absolutely amazing! Unfortunately, David’s bridal allowed for way too many people to try on dresses at once.

This was my second time visiting this store and I went in looking to try  only 2 dresses on and make my final decision that day, however it took our consultant over 45 minutes to find the 2 dresses, in which the one I came back to see was no longer available in store. I saw that this dress was in my profile already so it would have made sense if the store would have made sure all dresses in my profile were available and contact me if any were not - so we don't waste any time.
She was very apologetic, which I appreciated and did not complain further.
I did make my decision that day, but it was for the dress that was not available. I was about to order directly from the store, but they told me it would arrive 6 months later! I then checked their online store and was able to ship the dress to my house in 10 business days. PLUS! online had a promo code for $40 off of $175 and free shipping.
I ended up ordering it online and got it cheaper than I would have in store.

RECOMMENDATION: Check online before buying in store. Just go try it on and find out your size if you make an appointment. You'll save time and money.</text>

I truly had such a great experience with this store/team! I had an appt a few days ago to find my wedding dress here, but earlier that day I found my dream dress elsewhere. I still wanted to keep my appt to look for a veil and accessories, but wasn't sure if they'd let me bring in my dress since it was purchased somewhere else. Jasmine helped us out and she was so sweet the entire time, it wasn't  a problem to bring in my dress so I could find a veil that went well with it. We gave her an idea of the look we were going for and she pulled some absolutely gorgeous veils from the back. With her help we found the perfect veil and headpiece. Her and Candace were complete angels and they were so in love with the dress I picked out. They both agreed that I made the best choice with my dress and were so excited that they got to see it and help me find my accessories. Honestly the best experience I could have asked for!<//Text>

I ordered my bridesmaid dress for my cousin's wedding, from David's Bridal in Brea. They ordered the wrong dress, so we had to reorder it, they arrival time was set for the week of the wedding. It show up sooner, but the arrival time was still stressed me and my cousin out. We were happy to finally have the dress. Then we scheduled an appointment for alterations to put cups into the dress. We showed up early to the appointment to not be greeted by anyone for a while. We were told one of the seamstress was running late, so we waited patiently. The seamstress showed up at 12 our appointment was at 11. She didn't introduce herself. She then proceeded to ask me if I was ready after immediately entering the dress room. She kept asking me if I was ready. She even told me I could put my shoes on when I was at the stand. Then told me there were no cup. That I was a size c even though I told her I wear a 36 d. She proceeded to bring out one c cup when my cousin said that we came for the cups. She was rude and unprofessional. The seamstress's name we were told was Ana. I wrote this so no other bride has to deal with this.< /text>

I couldn’t have had a better experience than with Tina and Candace. I really appreciated the time they took with me to find the perfect dress and give me honest feedback (all good) on what they thought, instead of just telling me that I look amazing in all the dresses. I also went to the Costa Mesa location previously and they did not spend nearly as much individual time with me, and I didn’t feel as special as I did in the Brea location. The set up of the Brea location is more intimate and allows you to stand on a podium which also adds to the experience. Also, I found my perfect dress!!<//Review>

Came in today just looking for a bride and maid of honor dress ,but thanks to Leah and Valena's help we actually found the dresses that will go well with my casual California beach wedding, even though we did not have a appointment they gave us the same attention as if we did have one which made this experience that much special. I would recommend David's bridal as one of your choises to look for any kind of dress or occasion.
Thank you again

First, upon finally choosing a bridesmaid dress, which I had no help zipping up with (even though I had an assistant from the store allegedly helping me). The bridal party I am in was told we'd get a discount due to the fact the bride purchased her dress at David's bridal. When I asked for it they were unaware and kept insisting it was a sale from 5 yrs ago and then at one point said we don't have that discount yet. I had to call the maid of honor to confirm because I felt they were not believing me and after a bit of research and persistence I was reluctantly given the discount. Second, they said my dress would be in by 8/22 and they'd call, it's now 8/27 and after calling today the dress has been there for at least a week and no one had called. Completely disappointed with the service provided. Hopefully their customer service improves and they're more attentive.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>I had an amazing bridal experience at the Brea location! I scheduled my first appointment for a weekday evening so that the store would be less busy, in the hopes that I would be more relaxed and get a bit of extra attention from my consultant. I was the only bride there and everybody in the store was incredibly helpful! Valena and Leah helped me throughout the appointment and I could not have asked for better support. They were patient and Valena seemed to really put in the effort to understand my style/needs. It was my first time trying on wedding dresses so I wasn't sure that I would be ready to choose one. I felt like they understood this and wanted me to enjoy the experience; I never felt pressured or rushed to make a sale. With their support, I actually found the perfect dress and they celebrated with me when I said "yes"! Overall, fun and stress-free experience.</Review></record>

Kennedy made this experience so so easy!! Everyone had amazing customer service skills. I was such a bride-zilla when it came to my highschool prom so I was sure picking my wedding dress was going to be just as frustrating and emotionally draining, but Kennedy showed me otherwise! I said yes to the dress today! Thank you Davids Bridal for all your help!</review>

<Review>I had my first bridal appointment today with David's Bridal in Brea. My experience was AMAZING! I was greeted right as I walked in, and shortly after by Rebecca who welcomed me, helped me and really heard what I was looking for in a wedding dress. She literally hit it on the nose and I said YES to the dress ! Her attitude was great and she made me feel so comfortable. I'd highly recommend her and this location. Thank you for making me one happy bride to be and this experience so effortlessly easy.</Review>< user_name>

<username>Quinnie Stunrod<//username><time>1498459406746</time><rate>5<//rate><Review>After going to The Dresser in Fullerton and being treated very poorly, I didn't have high hopes for dress shopping. Sylvia completely changed my experience. She made sure to only show me dresses in my budget and the style I ended up leaning towards. I went in not having much knowledge about what I wanted other then not to be treated awful while planning my day and Sylvia showed me different styles and helped me get my dress that I fell in love with. I can not wait for my fiancee to see me in it. Now I have a much better look on planning my wedding.</Review>< pictures>

Went here looking for bridesmaid dresses. Was pretty disappointed with the service. It seems that they over booked too many people at one time we did not get much assistance. The bridal assistant that was helping us went to go help someone else and was no help to us. The girls trying on the dresses kept hitting people with the dressing room doors because there was too many people in that section. Some of the dresses were so dirty with make up stains and b.o.< /review>

I am usually not a happy shopper and was honestly dreading the whole thing but Yajaira made it so easy to pick a dress that everyone loved. We purchased my wedding dress and found a couple options for a bridesmaid's dress for another wedding I am attending the month before my own wedding. I definitely recommend checking out this location as they have plenty of options for most budgets and have great staff to help you find your dream gown.<//text>< userid>

I will never go to this place again McKenzie who I believe was one of the managers was so rude to me & my party as well as to one of the  employees I addressed the issue to management and nothing was done. Then after paying almost $400 for a prom dress they wanted an extra $75 to hem the bottom wich they should have done because there was no hem and the dress was purchased there before I paid for the dress they kept telling me oh dont worry we will fix any problems the dress has  well when the dress came in and I asked to fix it the prices were like $75 for this and $50 for that and $25 for this I was like why didn't you tell me this before I paid then they said oh you signed a contract I was like wow I thought I signed for making my payment but I guess its my fault for not reading what I sign</Review>

Awful staff. Said I could get my dress altered then went in for my appointment they changed their tune. Said they couldn't do it then acted like I was wasting their time. Wanted me to get a bigger size so they can charge me twice what the dress is worth. When I just needed the chest altered a inch or two? Yeah.... no thanks. Then I called the 1800 number. You guys are a joke. Rude and not very helpful. Btw my sister fixed my dress and it looks amazing! Picture  below is what my sister did! :)< /review>

I had a wonderful experience with my stylist Jordann. I came in the previous week with my maid of honor since I had been putting off making the appointment and she took the time before my appointment the following week to see what I liked. Mind you I ended up in a completely different dress than what I imagined myself in but keeping what I liked in mind she had me try on different silhouettes. She always kept my budget in mind and made all the difference in finding my dream wedding gown! Also the sales manager was very sweet and helped hold me in for my little bridal party to get a good idea of what the dress would look like when it was altered since I was such a weird size. Thank you so much for everything! :)</Review>

<Text>I had zero expectations about dress shopping because I had bought a bridesmaids dress from David's Bridal before and was so disappointed in the staff with how unprofessional they were and rude so I was very hesitant to return but I chose a different location and my thoughts changed with Valena. She was so great in helping me choose address that I fell in love with.

I would recommend the brea location to anyone shopping for a dress and tell them to ask for Valena!!< /Text><time>1564422921718</time>< username>

Loved my dress shopping experience, the lady helping me was nothing but awesome and she adapted to my personality and everything helping me with my decisions. She did high give a coworker after I decided on the dress I wanted which was a little unprofessional, should just wait until the customer leaves to celebrate a customer purchasing an expensive dress. The alterations were painful though. I felt that I had to adapt to what they wanted and not ask questions about anything. OVERALL, I would recommend this David's Bridal though, because the important part of dress shopping was an amazing experience.</Text>

Let's get the not so great out of the way first. As I should have expected Saturday is crazy busy. I had an appointment at 1030 and I was browsing around without coordinator for some time. I definitely recommend going on a weekday if at all possible. Ok now on to the good stuff. Jasmine was fantastic.  She got me the dresses I wanted and helped me get into them. She stayed within my budget and I found something that I loved one my first appointment.</Text>

I went in there on a Saturday. It wasn't crowded at all and even though I did not come in with an appointment, I was seen almost immediately. They had the exact bridesmaid dress I was looking for. Tina who had helped me with my fitting found the perfect sized dress, so perfect that I will not need to go in for alterations/ She also found a wonderful pair of shoes that matched so well with the color of my dress. With my dress, the shoes, and a pair of Spanx, I walked out of there in under 45mins and paid less than $200 overall. Thank you!!</Text>

<Text>The consultants and staff at the Brea David's Bridal are the nicest and most helpful that I've encountered! They ask you the right questions about your dress preferences and take the time to really help you find the right one without pressuring you to buy. I've been to 3 separate David's Bridals and would recommend any bride to come to the Brea location. FYI: this opinion comes from a bride (me) who dreaded the wedding dress finding process (hahaha), and I was pleasantly surprised by the customer service here. I went to this location twice with 2 different consultants, and both were great!< /Text>< Pics>

This is a very busy chaotic shop. The clerks were overwhelmed and lost their sense of personal customer service. If you want a dress that looks like everyone else's this is the place for you. I am not a fan.< /Review>

Ordering online is horrible if you need to return it. Better have months of time for that, but at least you have a small amount of time to return. In store is final sales so know thats the dress. And shipping dates are way to long..<//Review>

<review>If youre going to go look at dresses, do yourself a favor and book and appointment with Jasmine. This was the 4th store I had been to and Jasmine made the experience wonderful. I hate picking and trying on dresses, its not fun for me. But Jasmine started off asking about the wedding, tryingto envision it for herself and the look that I was going for. She helped pick out several dresses that all looked amazing and even got my moms approval! I think she would have kept picking dresses for me to try on if I hadnt stopped her lol. There was no rush, she explained all the different dress types and their designs. Jasmine, I cant thank you enough! I wish I had started at Davids Bridal with Jasmine as my stylist to begin with. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! (Now can you help me decide on which dress?) ;)</review>< name>

Rebecca was AMAZING! I’m pretty clueless when it comes to dress shopping, and aside from a couple of photos I found on Pinterest, I didn’t even know where to start. Rebecca helped me figure out what I liked and didn’t like until we found a dress I loved! She was great at her job and even stayed late to make sure I had a chance to try on different styles. Thank you David’s Bridal, and thank you Rebecca!< /review>

It was a very horrible experience. They did not make me feel like a bride at all. They only had 1 person on the floor to help me with my appointment. She would put my dress on me then leave to help the others. I was waiting for almost 30 minutes for a new dress to come. I do not recommend going here at all.<//Text>

I went there to find a couple of wedding dresses and bridal party dresses. My consult was with Kathy and it was a match made in heaven she was so sweet so generous and knew exactly what I wanted. She picked out 3 different dresses that werent on my list but kinda what I wanted. The first dress she picked I fell in Love with it was perfect it brought tears to my eyes and to my families eyes and knew that was the one for me. I loved my experience there and would recommend to anyone and to ask for Kathy. Thank you so much for a great experience!<//Review>

<UserId.>110429676277295704745</UserId.><Text>If I could give this team more stars, I would!  They are so professional, so courteous, and the only bridal team who was able to make magic happen for me!

When I first went into the Brea location, I was feeling very disappointed in my bridal experience up to that point.  In early January, my fiancé and I decided that we would finally have a wedding on May 11, 2019 (after a 7 year engagement).  This meant we had to get things together very quickly.  By the time I got to the Brea David’s store in February, I had been dress hunting at several other bridal boutiques, including other David’s locations.  Every representative from every store told me I couldn’t try on any of the dresses I really loved because they wouldn’t be able to order anything in time for my wedding - and NOTHING could be done about it.  I was crushed.  That was until I met Joanna, the Brea location manager.  I told her my challenges and how I was feeling and she immediately went into hero mode.  She told me I had come to the right place and I didn’t need to worry because she would help me through it.  She asked me which dress I wanted and pulled it for me to try on.  She also pulled all the right size undergarments for me THE FIRST TIME, just by looking at me, and helped me get into everything.  I was impressed with her already.  The moment I walked out of the fitting room and saw that dress on, I was in love!  And she knew it.  She excused herself to get on the phone with the warehouse and work her magic to make sure she could order that dress in time.  When Joanna came back to deliver the good news, that she would be able to order it for me, I literally cried!  It was my first yes in a world full of no and I was overjoyed!  I said yes to the dress and rang that little bell happier than ever!  I finally felt excited and confident about walking down the isle.  And although the dress I tried on in the store was too small, she ordered the dress for me in EXACTLY the right size.  It fits like a glove.  She is absolutely AMAZING!  Thank you Joanna!

Equally amazing are Jasmine and Leah, who assisted my soon to be mother in law and entire troop of bridesmaids with trying on every dress in the place.  My bridal party has a full range of shapes and sizes.  These ladies brought us every size and helped my girls every step of the way.  They were very discreet about sizing and measurements also which was a huge plus.  They even stayed past closing to help everyone order their dresses and load the info into the system for my out of state girls.  Leah has also assisted me every single time I’ve come into the store, whether it’s for pick ups or try on sessions.  She even helped me go through all the accessories to pick out my hair piece and veil.  She’s wonderful to work with, amazingly helpful, and so great to talk with.  Thank you Jasmine and Leah!

And last but certainly not least, I would like to give a big shout out to the best alterations lady in the world - the queen Elena!  She is outstanding to work with and has a wealth of knowledge and experience that she brings to the table.  She guided me in my search to find the perfect material to line the top of my dress and met with me many times to evaluate the material/colors I chose to make sure they were right.  I recently had my fitting and alterations appointment with her and she spent 2.5 hours with me, explaining and guiding me through the entire process.  I can say without a shadow of a doubt, you are in GREAT hands with Elena.  She is absolutely meticulous in making sure every detail is perfect.  She listens to your feedback and really strives to ensure you are happy with the end result.  She also makes the experience enjoyable as she is very kind and personable.  Thank you Elena!

Once again, the Brea team is absolutely fantastic and I cannot recommend them enough!  Thank you Joanna, Leah, Jasmine, and Elena!  You have certainly made me one happy bride!

All my best,

Wish the person had more experience in helping looking for a wedding dress.  I asked for input on what style she thought would make me look less chubby and didn’t really get any assistance.  She only went with the dresses I liked.  She forgot about the first dress that was picked.  Would have been nice to pull my favorites from the website before my appointment. I was also very open to trying anything on.  Went back to shop for bridesmade dresses and they double booked her.  We were ignored as well as the bride next to us.  They didn’t even give us chairs to sit in while we were waiting for the bridesmaid to try on the dresses.  I think it’s rather rude to book and appointment and get told I can go look on the floor for the bridesmaids dress in another size.  Isn’t that what the appointment was for?  Talked to store manager and we didn’t even get an apology.  Store manager is also useless.  Send she would talk to the front desk.  Shouldn’t the manager be responsible for how the store is ran?  I would never recommend the Brea, ca location.   Needless to say we walked out and purchased zero dresses today.</review>

Not super impressed with Davids. I was out and about looking for a bridesmaid dress and decided to pop into Davids. Well, let's just say; make sure u book an appointment with these peeps. They weren't too thrilled to help me I out. They told me that they couldn't show me around, they said I was welcome to look. I felt super awkward and left. .< /text>

<text>I made an appointment for a bridal fitting, and it was absolutely terrible!! I was shoved in the back of the store, my consultant was Jaclyn, and she came to me rushed, kept mentioning she just finished another fitting, we only had 90 minutes for her to help me. And then she proceeded to not listen to me. I'm not a girl who's dreamed of my wedding or a wedding dress, so I was clear that I didnt know what A line ment. I described what I was looking for, what areas I want to not accentuate and the material i was looking for. She brought 3 dresses, they were miserable, my sister grabbed 2 dresses trying to help get closer to the style i wanted and she snapped at her! She seemed flustered the whole time. But what made it worse was she never once made me feel specially, pretty, or even comfortable, in fact she did the exact opposite she put me in a dress way to small for me, and it was extremely unflattering I would have never left the room had I been able to see myself prior, but instead I was paraded out the room facing my family and a mirror, she had the nerve to ask what i though anand i was done and walked back into the dressing room. Her questions were more pressuring then helpful, i wish she would have given me a bit of space, and actually cared. She kept talking about her other job at disney and when i asked what brought her to David's she said oh they had a posting and I live down the street. Um wish I would have known that from the beginning because clearly she didnt care! She couldn't even finish off the consult, she un did the last dress and left and told me to see the front if I wanted to come back and keep looking.
I hope that no one else is subject to her, or to the way she made me feel! No one wants to cry in the dressing room while wedding dress shopping.</text><user>107980304316111541253< /user><username>Carrie.Vernoy Vernoy< /username>< date>

Terrible customer service. One of my bridesmaids went here to order her dress and they told her it would take 10 weeks to get her dress in when the Westminster location told my other bridesmaids it would take 4 weeks. They continued to argue with her telling her it was bridal season and it could not be expedited. We contacted the Westminster store and sure enough they were able to order her dress in her size and it would arrive in 4 weeks. I don't understand why the same store in a different city could order the dress and this store could be so completely off. Ridiculous!</review>

Such a great experience with this David's Bridal! They went above and beyond to help me find the correct size in a brides maid dress. Not only were they helpful, but they were courteous, kind, and fun! I wanted to try on a smaller size and not only did they call all regional stores to check for my size, but they also looked up the driving directions (I'm not from California) and times to those destinations. Yajaira helped me out on the floor and couldn't have been sweeter. She made my fitting experience very personable and I felt comfortable chatting to her about all concerns I had with the dress. Lauren helped us out at the desk and personally looked up driving directions for me while Yajaira checked for my size in neighboring stores. I have not had such a positive experience in any other David's Bridal and I would highly suggest making the drive to this David's to work with this group of ladies. This team is amazing and I would recommend them to everyone in the area!</review>

<review>At first I was gonna leave a review tearing into this store about how the desk rep and the other girl with long hair didn’t help me at all. They looked to see if the dresses my bride chose were avail and after not finding my size they just left me. The desk rep put 1 dress I pulled in a changing room I told I was just gonna pull dress and try on. No one came to check on me. I was crying along family trying to skype friends becuz I came after work to find a dress. I found one I thought wasn’t gonna fit becuz of the zipper.

I went to check out hoping I can exchange it at a different store that’s when I met Kennedy. Also the store manager who was a doll. They both asked me questions. Gave me options to order form a different store, check the floor personally as well have me try the dress on and see if they can zip it. I broke down crying to Kennedy about how I just felt hopeless trying to get a dress ASAP. He literally made me feel better and helped me. The manager with the blonde balayage and Kennedy are the only reason why I leaving this review. In the end they came through. Thank you very much both of you.</review><name>RItzy R< /name><user_id>100398035731015778875<//user_id>< Rate>

Absolutely love this place! As a new bride i was very nervous, anxious and stressed on how all this was going to be. I had gone to another bridal shop but had bad customer service so I came here instead. As soon as i came in i was kindly welcomed and started seeing dresses. Jacinda was my stylist and i gave her an idea on what i was looking for and my budget and she was right on point! She is so sweet and made it sooo easy and fun. I was feeling nervous since im a bit on the bigger size but she made me feel so comfortable! I said yes to my dress, im very happy and excited. Highly recommend to go to Jacinda. She makes it fun &  stress free for sure :)<//review>

So I created my appointment the night before online and the next morning I expected problems because it was last minute however to my surprise it was on file. They told me a consultant would be with me in a few minutes and to go ahead and take a look at the gowns. As I was waiting I found three to my liking. The consultant came and was nice however she seemed, out of it, very forgetful. She didn't help me with the dresses just escorted me to a dressing room, didn't introduce herself and then walked off. I don't know if it was her first day on the job but she wasn't very helpful. Did not ask what I was looking for, what styles I liked. I actually found the dress that I will be wearing and was super excited. She brought over the alteration lady and gave me a price. I went to go ring up my dress when we heard a bell chime and cheers. At the register she looked at me with an "oh cr@p" face and asked me if I wanted to ring the bell too. Seriously?
I've been here before, not as a bride and had an absolute terrific, fun time however this time makes me never want to go back ever again not recommend it. I mean dresses aren't cheap. Every visit no matter how big the party should be treated equally. We only get married once (hopefully) and we are paying a pretty big fat penny. I say give us the treatment equally and consistently.<//text>

The guy that helps with dressing the bride I was extremely rude. When I let the manager know she gave me an excuse.  All I know is when I'm going to get married , I am NOT going to this David's bridal. Also, my friend bought her dress in full in December,  and has yet to have her dress.. it is still sitting in the back of the store, just collecting dust...  they havent repaired it.</Review>

Me and my maid of honor went here to shop for a dress. They were nice. They were very pushy in the sense that the minute you walk through the door they want to be with you there ever step. It's hard to get a minute to breathe or even talk to your friends while your there, without being bombarded. It is a bit pricy, but nonetheless a good selection.< /Text>

It started off shaky due to too many appointments being booked and the consultants having to run around. However, Shelby turned it into a positive experience and went above and beyond! I would come back just for her!< /Review>

I am unhappy with going in for a fitting they pinning my dress telling me they are gonna do this and that... had my last fitting and come to find out my dress was never touched! So luckily for the riverside davids bridal let me come in last minute to have my dress done the RIGHT way.. my hem was never done my side were never taken in notning. It was the same as if i had just found it. I paid for my dress to just sit there on a hanger for a month! I did complain and yes i made sure to get my money back. Lady who did my fitting was nice in the beginning but got an attitude after i told her no to not sew my belt to the dress. She made it seemed like she cared was pinning the bottom to show it was gonna get hemmed and had me walk to make sure it was ok and i got 2 pins in my ankle. I had to kick the dress to get it out. Thanks for nothing  i wont be referring anyone to that store. The manager ans seamstress at the Riverside Davids Bridal were amazing! Thanks to them its getting done the RIGHT way!< /Review>

< review>
I was the MOH for my best friends wedding. The attendant (Rebecca) was a bit snippy at first, telling us that the brides requests were too vague and then too specific and telling us we could not bring drinks back, when I then saw most of the other guests had theirs.
Eventually we found a happy medium and the bride walked away with her perfect dress under budget. I think they just need to be a bit more relaxed to people walking in the door. For my friend it was the first bridal shop she'd walked into and was quickly overloaded with  rapid fire questions. I think they just need to slow down and get to know the brides needs before just throwing them headfirst into a rack of dresses and then being exasperated when she's taking her time. We booked a 2 hour slot and finished well within that time (even though we started 15 minutes late).</review>

<text>I'm so happy I shopped for my wedding dress at this David's bridal location. My original appt was a the Duarte location but it didn't have the designer gown I wanted to try on. I had my second appt with Bobbie in Brea and she was amazing. I made it very clear I didnt want to feel pressured as i did and Duarte and she defintaly respected that. She is very educated in the bridal industry and knows what she is talking about. I did schedule a follow up appt w/ Bobbie to have my mom help me choose between 2 dresses and Bobbie was just a great w/ the 2nd appt like the 1st one. Thank your Bobbie at David's Bridal Brea for helping find my dream wedding dress!< /text></record>

If Angelica is your stylist, ask for someone else. She wouldn't listen to anything I wanted. The whole appointment was uncomfortable & I couldn't wait for it to end. She took something that was supposed to be special & ruined it.< /Review>

This Davids Bridal has got to be the WORST experience I have had during my entire wedding planning experience.  I made an appointment to look at dresses at 4 pm. By 4:20pm I still had not been helped.  My name and information was taken and was left at that.  I was not offered a place to sit while waiting and was told NOT to pull any dresses from the rack.  By 4:30 when I still had not been helped I walked out disappointed that the Vera Wang I wanted to buy was going to be purchased elsewhere due to the lack of customer service.  The very next day I began getting phone calls from Bridal registeries nationwide my info was given to them WITHOUT my consent from Davids Bridal. TERRIBLE overall experience and  MY money will not go anywhere near that place!!!<//text>
