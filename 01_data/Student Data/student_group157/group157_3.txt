Very close to where I live. All washing machines work, the only reason I'm not giving it 5* is because you can't wash on hot cycle. Other than that it's a great place to wash. Very clean and the man in charge are super nice.</Review>

DONT COME HERE THE MACHINES ARE BROKE. AND HE KNOWS IT. (HIS WAY OF GETTING FREE MONEY RIGHT) HE DOSENT MAKE CUSTOMERS AWAY. YOU HAVE TO WAIT ON HIM TO COME TO GET YOUR MONEYBACK & HALF THE DRYERES HAVE OUT OF ORDER SIGN ON THEM. HE DIDNT EVEN APOLOGIZE IF YOU CANT AFFORD TO RUN A BUSINESS AND KEEP THE HOT WATER ON THEN DONT HAVE A BUSINESS BECAUSE IT CREATES A BAD REPUTATION UNDER YOUR NAME.</text>

It's been around for at least. 20 years. I have to admit I was washing my personals there not to long ago. It's open 22 hrs. of each day 7 days a week. It's a little rough . But definitely the most convenient.< /review>

I love that they are open 24 hours! I work late,and by the time i get home and get my laundry gathered up,most laundrymats are closing. But here,i can start my washing,then run next door and do any shopping i need,or grab a pizza or tacos from restaurants located in the same shopping center!< /Review>

< review>
DO NOT GO HERE!! I always go here to do all my laundry because it's very close to my house.  But not anymore I went in today and one of their dyers burned all of my towels. I talked to the guy on duty and all he said was that I left them in too long but that's a lie because I always take my towels in to wash and dry and I run them in the dryer the same amount of time and they always dry perfect with the amount of time I put. So I told him something must be wrong with the dryer but he blew me off and didn't even inspect the dryer or offer any help or compensation... but I guess thats what the courts are there for so I guess I'll take that route to get my money back for what I spent there and what I paid for my towels and my new ones that I'm about to buy (which were about 8 towels)  .. I will be doing my laundry elsewhere now< /review>

<Name>MrACF1926< /Name><Time>1501962304595<//Time><Rate>2<//Rate><text>This laundromat is located very close to my workplace. I went yesterday and much to my surprise it was pad-locked, apparently due to "improvements". There was no advanced notice. The signs on the doors said it will be closed for two weeks. We'll see. The laundromat is not very big and there isn't much space to fold your stuff. It's usually very crowded during the day, but it's open all night. It's normally very clean, but many of the smaller washers and some of the dryers have not been working for a while. There are usually enough baskets, but there are no machines to sell soap or dryer-sheets. There are four coin-changing machines, but normally only one or two work. Several people like to abandon their clothes in the dryers for hours or use only the dryers and I've never seen any attendant do anything about it. If you find a washer available, finding a dryer later is much more difficult. I'm currently looking for a different laundromat.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Went to a larger shop to repair or replace my tire and was basically sent away because I chose not to purchase 4 new tires. So, I drove by Indio Blvd remembering Ruben’s tire shop, and got a great deal with good honest service. I was in and out very quickly.<//text>

<Review>Some business's give me bad vibes and make me feel that I can't trust them. However, this company shows that they have their customers best interest at heart. The employees were extreamly polite and the best part... They were open on a Sunday!</Review>< Pics>

Awesome service, great price for four new tires out the door.  Angela at the front desk was very helpful, same price on my bill was the same price quoted to me over the phone!  In and out in less than 20 minutes on a Wednesday- you guys rock!!!!   Will be referring you to friends and family, thank you.< /Text>

These guys take care of business. They sell great used tires and if you are looking for a specific tire, they will go out of their way to find it for you. Best used tire place in the desert.</Text>

I came here once when I needed to switch the tire on a wheel for a spare one I already had. I went in, got the tire switched out, and was out of there in less than 15 minutes.</review>

This restaurant is the one I always prefer. I eat in many restaurants but here I keep coming back again and again. The crew is very cordial and the food they place on your table is so appetizing. I would always prefer to have a decent meal here. I recommend this place with pleasure.< /review>

Amazing food! Ordered spicy miso ramen with crab meat level 3 (not that spicy, for reference I like spicy burning stuff). Crab meat was friend a bit on a saltier side but crispy and delicious. Would definitely recommend this place. Get their Thai iced tea with tapioca...hits the spot on a hot day.<//Text>

Absolutely loved it. Delicious foods I'll post some before and after pics. My ten year old and I enjoyed all of our food. We ordered Edamame for appetizer salted. She ordered rice bowl with Teriyaki Salmon I ordered Red Curry Ramen with Veggies and Tofu. Service was good and quick. Clean place with nice seating and TV's. Definitely recommended this place for hearty meals.</text>

Had the chicken karaage for the appetizer. That was solid with the sauce. Picture is veggie broth Raman with whole chicken leg. Amazing flavor and great value.</text>

The chicken karaage was a big let down personally, the batter was very bland and didn't really have the flavor and crunchiness I like.
The tonkatsu broth and noodles and pork were good, but also felt there was an abundance of cabbage instead of more broth.<//review>

<review>Pro-Tip - this is a great place for locals.

This is a great new ramen stop in North Beach. I would give then extra points on how well the broth is done here. Service is convenient and quick.</review><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Very average food. I ordered their tofu and vegetables rice bowl to go and it did not have much taste. When I asked for the receipt, the waitress was confused and suddenly decreased the amount by 2 dollars to match the menu saying to me that the price has changed recently. Weird.</Text>

Absolutely mediocre. The broth tastes like salt with some sort of souce. Pork is not tender and nothing blends together. Maybe good enough for a lunch, but I can not recomend this ramen over a fastfood burger or smth. We tried ramen and miso and they are not that different in terms of quality.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The chicken karaage was ok and the ramen was good, but since it's San Francisco, it's no wonder that it's boring! But I want to eat warm food.

치킨 가라아게는 괜찮았고 라면도 먹을만 했습니다, 다만 샌프란이니 당연하겠지만 매콤한 맛은 그닥 없어 맛이 심심하다고 느끼실 수 있어요! 그치만 따뜻한 음식 드시고 싶으심 가볍게 한끼 괜찮을 것 같습니다~</Text>

One of the top brunches in San Diego! The brunch menu is small, only having 6 items or so, but everything is phenomenal. The chicken and biscuit is the best I’ve ever had. Seriously. I’ve had the most famous ones in the South and this beats it. Have a cocktail or cold brew with your meal and enjoy. The service is very personable and professional. Brunch starts at 11 am on Saturday and Sunday, and sometimes they offer the lunch/dinner menu as well.</text>

< review>
This place is really unique in the sense of it’s like a small more laid-back chill type of atmosphere, it’s not as dimly lit as I would like my bars to be but that’s just my preference. The drinks were definitely very unique and flavorful, with their own types of spin to them their own unique blends and this is one of the reasons why I would come back just to kind of try everything out and see what I really like. The atmosphere was cool there were some hipsters in there the art wall Decour and couches have like a nice set up to where you feel kind of like you’re inside your own home dope place overall in kind of a hidden gem.<//review>

Love the food and service!  Chad and Cesar would accommodate all my taste buds whims for fresh, raw, pasta, or truffle!  If I can't decide, they help me decide it make up something for me with the perfect paring of wine and/or cocktails!  Great interiors, service, and fire flues!</review>

How long have we been waiting for this. Finally a place that has it all - a restaurant, two bars, and a LOUNGE that's not just a bar but actually serves food late night. Wow! what a concept. New York has been doing this for decades and San Francisco is finally catching up.<//Review>

<text>VODKA + SODA

F* white claw, YOU is the truth. Facts: real vodka in their soda (7.5%) compared to white claw no no real vodka only alcohol is the fermentation of the sugar.

The bar is cute and quaint. Came here for the Topo Chico and Tamales event, free Topo Chico but not free Tamales. That night they featured a small variety of Tamales to purchase, I had the strawberry tamale and it was good. Never had a pink tamale drizzled with condense milk until that night. I didn't order any of the special Topo Chico cocktails (ex: og, vodka, Topo Chico) because someone next to me referenced that cocktail took away the fizz of the Topo Chico.

In addition, my friends and I attended the Meat Ball and You & Yours was a vendor there. I had an unlimited amount of generous free pours of all their canned cocktail flavors (vodka mule, gin & tonic, vodka cranberry soda, key lime vodka soda). All were good but my favs were key lime vodka soda.

And You & Yours sells in some local grocery store. I was bummed to know that on weekdays they don't open until 4pm. I happen to stumble upon a case at Lazy Acres grocery store of my favorite Key Lime vodka soda. It's my go to drink when I go sailing!

Overall, good stuff. Kind of pricy but worth the buzz.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80d9535e04a4ebaf:0xaba68288ea6eee92</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>What a lovely space with such high-quality cocktails! They are made with such care and expertise that the cocktails are worth their premium prices. This East Village distillery is certainly worth checking out for at least a drink. A hidden highlight is that this is a female-owned establishment!<//Text>< username>

< review>
Delicious craft cocktails on happy hour, but subpar service,  In addition to the seasonal summer cocktail menu, there's also a happy hour menu featuring a few of the cocktails. I'm glad my husband and I went with the happy hour menu - the drinks are essentially 50% off from $12 to $8.

The "Prized Pony" is a refreshing summer cocktail. It reminds of the Moscow Mule with vodka, ginger, lime, mint, and peach bitters.

"Do You Want That Spicy" cocktail has a spicy kick from the Serraro bitters. A strong Citrus flavor from the grapefruit, lime, and cucumber.

My husband and I enjoyed both drinks and going to get a 2nd round, but stopped short due to the lack of service. There was a big bachelor party that sat down before us and my husband and I patiently waited for 40 minutes to get our drinks. Once everyone in the party got their drinks and others were served at the bar, we walked up to the bar and were ignored by the bartenders. While I understand they are busy making drinks, they didn't acknowledge my husband and I until we requested to close out. They seemed apathetic and not welcoming.

Great distillery and cocktails, but be prepared to wait for them! The distillery allows dogs, so feel free to bring your furry friend.</review>

<Text>After a year of not going to Olive Garden, it was absolutely delicious. The only thing I didn't care for was the waitress always saying " OK Honey, I'll get that for you Honey, I'll  be right back Honey" it was the way she said it, kind of condescending.  It irked me. She was a very GOOD waitress, on top of everything (we tipped her more than 20%) but I found "HONEY" inappropriate.</Text>< Pictures>

Funny thing you order trough phone way before funny they say one time be here and even like that they take their own very slowly time not worth it to be trying even eating out or ordered trough phone</Text>< Pics>

Nice place to have dinner with the family,  sad thing is that they just to give you a bunch of chocolate when you pay your food and now they only give you one for each person and that's it.</review>

There are several options to choose from in the Margarita crossings area. Not only is the mall right across the street but there is red lobster Mexican restaurant Olive Garden and many other little stores that can cover a lot of your needs.< /Text>

<response>None<//response><pictures>None< /pictures><review>Extremely rude customer service from the manager (think her name is Judy) and the male server.  The portion is getting smaller and smaller each time we visit for the price that we pay.  We politely asked the manager and the server about  the portion size, the manager then gave me 3 more short strands of chow mein then both of them gave us a look then walk away. How rude and insulting!  Her attitude is unprofessional! I understand, that we sometimes have a bad day, but as a manager, she needs to set a good example for her staff, and that is to treat ALL customers with respect and professional.<//review>< GmapID>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Very bad customer service.. my recent take out order was missing an item. I had asked for kung pao chicken with my order and the person ( a lady) who took the order also repeated the order which included this item. I called them to say it was missing the item they defended by saying that they never heard me say it. Not a very ethical way to defend their position. Needs a perspective change.. Hope they take this feedback seriously and make some improvements.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808ff2ea6487fb97:0x3c2d7c1a9dd1a7cc</GmapID></record>

I shyed away from Panda Express for many years because they were a chain, but now I'm hooked on them. This is extremely tasty and fresh Chinese food!!!!<//Review>

<review>We take out from the nearby Panda Express all the time.  The food quality is usually acceptable level but today's order was bad.  The meats were dry as if they sat on a hot stove for hours.  The honey walnut shrimp had no honey nor walnut.  Maybe a new cook, maybe just a bad batch but I'm not happy with the taste of today's order.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

There was hardly a tablespoon size noodles on the plate and 3-4 tiny pieces of chicken. The dinner plate is now more of an appetizer dish or a kid’s meal.

< Review>
Note: I am an amateur Panda Express critic ;) . Panda express is 10/10 overall. I am reviewing this location compared to others.

Place is clean. During lunch and dinner, there are rather long lines. Staff is mediocre. Food is mediocre, but can be below average at times.

Verdict: Go here if you live near the place. Don't drive to eat here.< /Review>

Great place to come for fast, but not greasy, Chinese food.  Lots of variety to please everyone.  Clean and friendly service.   This location does a good job of having the various dishes ready.< /text>

<review>Mostly good experience. Expect long queue during lunch and dinner times. It'll move fast. If the item you want is just being prepared, then you'll have to wait for 5-10 mins.

Very efficient staff. Not really courteous since their turnover time is fast. I've seen them being friendly and relaxed at non rush times.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

There are different proportions like bowl, plate etc. Each proportion comes with rice or noodles along with one or more dishes. The rice is basically fried rice with vegetables and noodles is called Chowmeen which is basically noodles with vegetables. The dishes comes with preparations of beaf, pork and chicken. All together it's a awesome a place to dine</review><Response>None</Response>< Time>

Went in at 9:20  , 40 minutes from closing and had to wait for any food except fried rice. As I walked in the first thing I saw was the cook packing the kitchen and cleaning up, I guess he gets to go home early?<//review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Where I go so often. It's everywhere in the country, so I use it when I go on a trip. A restaurant that would have been worth it without Panda Express ㅋ It's cheap and delicious, so I like it.

너무나 자주가는 곳. 전국 어디에나 있어서 여행갈때 애용합니다. Panda express없었으면 어쩔뻔했나 싶을 정도로 소중한 식당 ㅋ 저렴하고 맛있어서 좋아요.<//Review>

A friend told me to try this company if I wanted a roof that would add value to my house through functionality and aesthetics. I gave them a shot, and they did not let me down. They delivered on the project fast, and my roof stands out, just like my friend had promised.</review>

<Review>Regret working with this company: (Texcote Coolwall and stucco/wood repair) My experience: A sales representative was coming through the neighborhood offering services from the company and conveniently enough I was looking to have the exterior of my home redone so I set up an in person appointment with the company and they came out and gave an excellent and friendly overview of their painting and exterior repair services via another sales representative. They "offer" a 15% discount if you decide to go with them that day, otherwise you have to pay what they consider to be full price. I don't have much any complaints with the sales representatives as they were very friendly, although very pushy as well. The project manager introduced himself the following day and we discussed the timeline for when they would start. On the first day the crew came out and pressure washed the house without warning with my windows still open in some rooms so naturally dirty water got everywhere in those spaces while my wife frantically ran around stuffing towels underneath the doors as if a flood was happening because they were pressure washing under the front door as well. The next day they came out the immediately started applying the primer BEFORE they had done any repairs to the exterior stucco so I attempted to call the project manager and office multiple times to address this (The crew didn't speak English). Turns out my project manager had quit, and the company hadn't informed me of this so now I'm left to try to figure this out on my own. I finally got a call back 3 days later after the crew had already finished priming the home and my concern of why the priming occurred before the repairs was dismissed by the project manager, but somehow the crew managed to start repairing the exterior after this conversation. I want to note that the first few days of this project, nothing had been cleaned up from the yard, even though we were told (and reconfirmed with the project manager) that the crew would be cleaning up each day. Instead, at the end of each day, we had to clean up stucco and debris ourselves. We also had to pick up left over food that had been left by the crew a few times as well. At this point, ripped up stucco, massive amounts of peeling paint, and rotted wood has been primed over and I just know that it won't end up being the "new" looking house which the company advertised at this rate. The stucco repair was subpar (It just looks smeared like peanut butter rather than texture matched to the home and is very apparent), but at least the paint and trim itself doesn't look too bad. They didn't prime the repaired stucco and wood, rather just immediately started painting over it with the final paint. Massive amounts of over-spray all around the ground, on the patio, and on areas of concrete, but I all but had given up on trying to work with them at this point I just wanted all of this over with. The sales pitch team is great, the work is poor, and the communication was lousy. I felt like I was being scammed from start to finish. Additionally they claimed the paint would aid in reducing in home temperatures, but I set up temperature gauges inside and outside to see before and after, and the home is consistently hotter after the paint. For the price tag, we expected stellar work all around and that is just the opposite of what we got. The also emailed me loan docs at the end to sign, and then sent me the same loan docs already signed with my name on them with their IP address on it. (I didn't sign them myself)

Edit 1: included a few of the photos (many more exist) I took throughout the process as evidence.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Great experience started with Kyle Bryant and his awesome team David, Felipe and Sam. This team knows what they are doing. David showed up when I called him to ask question to explain in 30 minutes
As 8 months pregnant they didn’t make me clean after them. Thank you Felipe and Sam being really careful.

<review>Genesis Home Improvements did an excellent job from start to finish. Our appointment was set promptly, they arrived on time and went over their products and services.

<Review>Genesis did our Roof in 2 days flat. We were very very happy with how fast and professional they were from initial quote to final product.
Install was fast and clean.

A few weeks later we got a quote for Coolwall and got that done given how well the prior job went. Again, they were fast and professional.

Def would recommend these guys for any home improvement job !< /Review>< Pictures>

We were very pleased with the people who worked on our project. They were thorough, courteous and very professional. The prep work done before they painted was the best we’ve ever seen. They were always on time, worked long days to stop at good places. They cleaned up at the end of each day so our house wasn’t a mess. Vincent came back after the project was completed, double checked his work and even washed the windows. They are a quality team..< /review>

We hired them to paint the exterior of our house in La Mesa.  They are an organized company and the process was a breeze.  I met with one of the representatives Brian, who took measurements and explained about the Coolwall Coating product they use.  This was a no brainer for us as we just bought the home and plan to live there for a long time. This Coolwall product is guaranteed to last and not fade or chip.  The price is more than paint but the benefits made it a worthy choice long term.  David was our project manager and his crew were friendly and hard working.  He runs a tight ship and very own knew their roles. They were tidy and considerate.  They also offer financing and it was a very easy process to get this work started, and finished in a very timely manner.  The Coolwall product has many colors , too many to choose , and we found the perfect r match for our home and it looks great.  Thankyou Genesis team. We are very pleased with the outcome.</Review>

We have used Genesis Home Improvements for three different projects; Heating and Air, Stucco and Painting and windows and we are completely satisfied with each one. Every project was done on time and done as promised. Communication was smooth throughout the projects and any concerns both during and after were addressed promptly. Genesis Home Improvements. If you have any home improvement needs highly recommend Genesis Home Improvements. They have fantastic financing options that may fit your budget available as well. Would I use them again? Indeed I would! If you have any home improvement needs, try giving Genesis Home Improvements a call.</Text>

Very disappointed with the length of time it is taking for someone to address our concerns. I have been dealing with the same issue since last year, and still have not heard back from anyone. They were very responsive during the sales part, but after the initial visit.... it is practically impossible to reach anyone. They have also sent an incorrect quote to the finance company (in which they have yet to fix despite the constant phone calls the finance representatives have made to them). I would not recommend them to anyone.

** Hi Matt, we’ve left several messages for you and Eric. In fact, on January 14, Jessica had promised to relay our message but still nothing. I hope we can finally speak on Monday & this can finally be resolved. Thanks.< /Text>

We are so pleased with the exterior work done recently on our home. The quality is excellent and has exceeded our expectations. The work was completed on time and the craftsman responsible for the bulk of the work was professional, responsive to all our questions, and very personable. The attention to detail is amazing! All of the members of the company that we dealt with from the salesmen to the project manager (Dave Scott) were considerate and kind in all of our interactions.

We wanted to go with a reputable company that could give us the confidence that our home investment was protected with a solid and reliable roof for many years to come. We chose Genesis because, though more expensive than other quotes, a roof is a big deal and we liked their promise of professionalism and warranty. Come down to it, they talked a big game of project managers and inspections, but far under delivered on those promises. There was reluctant involvement from the project manager (we had to call our sales rep multiple times to even reach the project guy because he would not return our calls). Meanwhile, they started sending us billing statements before any of our complaints were addressed or responded to. See below….

Pros:
-Fast response time. A rep came by with a quote and presentation within a day and the work was done in a week.
-Fast work time. Out and done in three days, close to their 2 day promise.
Warranty
-Hard workers. The roofers worked on a 100+ degree day, and they worked hard.

Big cons:
-Cut power to our AC/Heat. Tried our AC after the work was done and it would not turn on. We called to report this and they asked “are you sure it worked before?” no apology or offer to come inspect. Of course we were sure, we just completed a home inspection during our buy! After two weeks of calls, they sent their roof guy out to inspect, who then told us everything looked fine on their end, but admitted he knew nothing about power… he’s “just a roofer and all the cables seemed to be in the right places”. Two more weeks of calls went by before they sent an electrician to look at it. The electrician notified us that the power to the unit had been cut by the roofing team during their demo work. It took him all day in and out of our house clearing hallway cabinets and closets throughout the house (without a mask during COVID quarantine, mind you…) to crawl deep enough into the space where he could patch and repair the wire. They never offered compensation (hey, we sent a guy out) and never apologized.

-Caused a new leak in our kitchen. Removed and discarded a cap on an old vent in the kitchen. When it rained the ceiling became discolored and damp. They came back and replaced the cap, but left us to do the repair in the kitchen ceiling.

-Broke a vent pipe causing a second new leak. A pipe above a vent in our bedroom was cracked in the process and caused a large puddle to form on our newly installed $3K bamboo flooring causing minor damage to our floor (that we had to fix). After another few phone calls they came back and inspected and fixed the pipe and acknowledged breaking it, but no apologies or compensation offered.

-Left the roof discolored. Without consulting us, they scraped off large portions of transitional roofing material leaving the roof terribly discolored. Because it is a flat, multilayer roof, it is visible from ground level and is awful looking. Once their work was complete, they told us about it and offered that they could quote us to come back and paint it. Yes, they want to charge us to come back and paint it!!!

Minor Cons:
-Left a mess of gravel and roofing materials around the perimeter of our property. A month later and I’m still finding pieces all around in plants, on sides of the house etc. They sell a big “zero mess” job in their pitch, but didn’t deliver on that. We’ll have to pay a professional to sweep it out of the terracotta shingle overhang around our door. Meanwhile, I’ll continue to pull the sticky bits out of my potted geraniums.

-Allowed roofing material to fall into roof vents so that it came out in sprinkles over time. Came home to find our white bedding peppered with roofing material – black and white gravel substance, some sticky black pieces.< /Text>

What a great company this is!! I have worked with Genesis for over a decade and what this company provides is a true sense of love and comradery which radiates within the organization, leading out towards all prospects and clients. Genesis has given me the opportunity to find ways to serve their clients satisfactorily while compensating me in more ways than one, making a solid living for my family and I. The owner and CEO have been nothing short of amazing, training everyone within the organization to ensure high quality service for those seeking their service. If you want to be a part of something great while developing your people and sales skills this is the company to do it with. Thank you, Genesis, for taking the chance in hiring me over a decade ago, teaching and trusting me to serve your clients well, I am forever grateful.<//review>

I recently installed their high-efficiency windows, and I can feel the difference. It’s winter, but the amount I am spending to keep the house warm has reduced. It’s just like they had told me!<//Text>

Genesis did a great job on painting the exterior of our home. Once we worked out all the details, the crew got started right away. They were professional, friendly and very accommodating and were able to meet our expectations. Thanks to Bryan, Luis, Dave, Roberto, Samuel and Daniel for all their hard work and special attention they put in giving our home a beautiful makeover. They did such a good job, the neighbors next door booked an appointment and are in the process now having their 2-story home done. We will continue to recommend others to call Genesis!< /review>

I bought a 1937 Spanish casita nearly 15 years ago. Over time, the stucco developed a lot of cracks, even falling off in spots. I wanted to get it repaired before the rainy season, fearing moisture might damage the framing. Genesis came up with a competitive (not cheap, but very competitive) price for TexCote/Coolwall, which promotes itself as "never re-stucco or repaint again!"  Genesis was not high pressure. Their crew was professional, careful and friendly, and finished my job sooner than estimated. I am very pleased with the results, and I hope the product will live up to its lifetime guarantee! I heartily recommend Genesis. FYI, my next project is water-wise landscaping for my naked front yard!<//text>

<Review>Tip, Jeff, and their guys were great! They did a really great job on our roof. Cleaned up after they were done. We now have a beautiful new roof with a 50 yr warranty! They even came back out and fixed an issue I found after the fact! That is customer service!!! They didn’t moan or say you should’ve found that during the work. They just said we will be there and came out and fixed it!!! It doesn’t get better than that! They have a customer for life now!<//Review></record>

<Text>The company was very up front on products and costs and how paintng our house would help it stay beautiful forever.
The workmen were prompt, polite and worked very hard. They cleaned up after themselves. The manager checked in regularly and did a final walk around to be sure everything was done right.
We are very happy with what they did. The house looks beautiful! I would hire them again anytime.< /Text>< Pics>

Genesis Home Improvements did a wonderful job replacing my roof.  The representative who provided us the estimate was very polite, knowledgeable and professional.  The roofers were respectful of our home and kept all areas tidy.  The company offers great financing options and their product is amazing.  The roof has a 50 year warranty!  They replaced the roof on schedule and the project manager Jeff was always available to answer questions we had.  I highly recommend this company to anyone who needs a new roof.</Text>

The sales pitch, staff, and everything was great. It was a promising situation until they did a terrible job on part of the roof that they are refusing to fix properly. The rest of the roof looks amazing but this is how they left our roof! (picture below) There are two of these areas, both of which stick out like a sore thumb. This is ridiculous and unacceptable. Completely unhappy with the results and lack of professionalism to fix their mistake.<//Text>

Genesis Home Improvement did a splendid job replacing my roof. Kyle who came to do the estimate was polite, professional, and informative about the whole process. The roofers were on time and professional, making sure that the area was kept clean of debris before, during, and after the job. Jeff, the project manager, was attentive with making sure the project was completed in a timely manner. Plus, the roof comes with a 50 year manufacturer warranty.<//Review>

Once the windows arrived, David called us to schedule the installation.  His crew were on time, worked hard and were a joy to have around.  This has been a wonderful experience and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to friends and family.

<Text>I had Genesis Home Improvements paint the exterior of my home with their CoolWall Systems Stucco Coating.  From start to finish everyone was very friendly and professional.  David Scott the project manager was very attentive to every detail and worked hard to get me the color match I was looking for.  The men that did the initial washdown of the walls, the stucco repair, and the painting were fantastic.  Very courteous, professional, and friendly.  They did a wonderful job and made sure I was pleased with their work and cleaned up afterwards.

After some research online for replacing my Patio Cover I found Genesis Home Improvements and am I glad I did.  They have a great team.  All whom I met with were polite, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The first part of the process was an in- house demo and informative presentation about their Patio Cover options, covering materials, styles, measurements and pricing.  They offer financing too and this was also covered during the consultation. Genesis made it easy as they provide a lot of info from the start and answered all of our questions during the appointment, they also have a great product so it really was a no brainer.

After signing our contract the crew scheduled a start date, and a little over a week we had our Patio Cover installed on the home.  The installers Paul and Sam were awesome to have around, really fun, friendly guys and they were always respectful of our property and kept the work areas clean and tidy.  Eric was the manager who came out to check in with us and make sure all was running smoothly.

All in all this was a great experience, and our first remodel project since purchasing the home a few years ago.  We will work with Genesis Home Improvements again int he future as they do windows too.  Highly recommend them to anyone needing home improvements.</Text>

Genesis replaced my roof. They have impressive products, with lifetime warranties and offer financing options.  They did excellent work and finished on schedule.  Everyone we dealt with was polite, professional and cared that our needs were met.  Jeff, the crew manager was great, he really knows how to manage his team and make sure all areas were kept tidy throughout the project and that the schedule was adhered to.  I highly recommend Genesis to anyone who needs a roof, they are a quality outfit through and through.</Review>

Working with Genesis home improvement has been a great experience. When the door to door marketer came by I was very skeptical and really didn’t want to listen, but he made sense and followed up with the salesman, Mia. she explained in detail the problems with my “in need” stucco all around the house. she is very very knowledgeable, she explained many benefits of the Texcote product and lifetime warranty. thanks Mia you are amazing,
The clincher for me was I could change the color of my house and trim at the same time, which I’ve wanted since I bought it. When the crew arrived they introduced themselves and got busy. They were all professional and courteous, they cleaned up each day and were prompt. The time estimate was 2 weeks from start to finish, all was completed in one week. My house looks fantastic.< /text>

Genesis are great!  They replaced my roof this month.  The whole process has been wonderful.  I first met with one of their representatives Pat who was very nice, and provided my husband and I with a very informative detailed consultation about the best roofing materials, a thorough roof inspection and also explained all the available financing options the have for customers.  The roof crew were great.  They had the roof tear off and replaced in a few days!! They were respectful of out home, and always on time.   We also met with David, who was the manager on duty who was available for any questions we had, and kept checking up on the crew's progress, made sure everything was on schedule.  This was a large project as we have a big home, and a considerable financial investment,.  We are so happy we chose Genesis Home Improvements as they really delivered a quality product and have excellent customer service from all of the staff.<//review>

<Time>1580844882886</Time><Text>As soon as I arrived home from work one evening, a representative from this company solicited my business in my driveway. Catching me off guard, he quickly took my information and must have marked I was interested in a new roof for my house. He said someone would be by to provide a price estimate on Saturday at 10 AM. I let him know I would consult with my husband to determine if this was something we were interested in pursuing.

My husband and I decided we were not interested in a new roof for our home, which I let the first representative who called me know. I was then called seven times over the course of two days to confirm a roof estimate I had already cancelled. After the seven phone calls, I blocked the number on my cell phone. The next day, I then received a text message from a different number from an individual identifying herself as "Mia from Genesis" confirming my Saturday at 10 AM appointment. I texted her back, saying I had already cancelled this appointment twice and to please stop calling me.

I have now received three phone calls that came up on my phone as "No Caller ID" from someone identifying themselves as a "Manager at Genesis." I have asked to not be contacted anymore each time, but still keep receiving phone calls. I have been contacted 11 times through someone coming to my home, phone calls, and text messages over the course of five days. At this point, I would consider this borderline harassment. When we do consider installing a new roof on our home, it will absolutely not be with this company as they seem extremely desperate for business to harass potential customers like this.<//Text>< user_name>

Genesis staff were helpful, knowledgeable, thorough, honest and their work crews are skilled professionals.

<UserId.>114048087115333310706< /UserId.><Text>I recently had two projects done by Genesis Home Improvement. I had profound termite damage to a wooden pergola patio cover and to a wooden French door. They replaced both using very high quality vinyl. The pergola looks like real wood and the additional lattice will provide additional coverage yet still let the sun in. The French door is beautiful and no more swelling with moisture and best of all no more termite food! The craftsmen that did each project were very professional, friendly and answered all my questions. When they left there was no debris left behind. Though the cost was not inexpensive it was very fair for the quality of the materials and the workmanship. I would highly recommend them for home improvement projects.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

To start with Patrick Clark's measurements were not accurate which caused problems with the installation for Dale. The production manager Erick Bensor  came out the next day to do a re-measure but all he did was measure the distance from the patio to the attachment point and collect more money. Due to these errors the job was not done the way I was expecting. Also the post anchor bolts were not properly installed. One is completely missing, one is sticking out of the hole approx. 98% and three are not secured in the holes. Dale wanted payment and said he would be back the next day to fix them but he never showed. It's been nearly five weeks and several phone calls to Erick and all I get are promises. This shows to me and it should to you that this company can not be trusted. Look for a more trustworthy company for your project.<//review>

Had my roof done by Genesis about 1 year ago, and then decided to get my house painted by the same company.  The salesman Lorenzo was very informative and a pleasure to work with.    He helped with the credit application process and was able to get me a good deal along with a manageable payment.   Dave Scott was the project manager for the job.  He was very patient with me while I picked the color for the house.  The crew that worked the job took great care of the items around the house.  They moved or covered them to keep them from getting sprayed.   When the job was complete we did a walk around to inspect the work. Had a couple of touch ups which were corrected.  In all Genesis was a very good company to work with.  I would highly recommend them for any home improvement project.</Text>

This is the second time we hired Genesis to work on our home and I felt compelled to share my experience. The first project was a roof which went very well and now they just finished painting my home with their Coolwall product. With the current pandemic situation I was cautious to take on a new project but we desperately needed it as there was a lot of stucco damage around the base of our home.  The crew was very organized and wore savagery equipment and masks and made me feel at ease when they worked on my property. The project manager David made sure they followed recommended safety measures to ensure we were all protected from extra risk. The product is wonderful and my home looks brand new. Thank you Genesis you made this project a breeze!</text>

Genesis has taken there second payment out of my my friends credit card and they have left their property a mess. There is paint drips, paint spills, Paint overspray, ext.. I had to do a walk through with Eric, he was an hour late and never bothered to tell us. As I pointed out over a dozen problems to him he giggled them off, and then led his two painters around like kindergarteners pointing the problems out to them . They determined they'd be back for another 6 hours. Problem is The clean up would be 6 hours Alone.< /Text><Name>Amy Lee Lockhart</Name><Rate>1</Rate></record>

(Translated by Google) Today I went to buy a battery for a van and the young man who served me was quite friendly and helpful, as was the girl at the counter. The young man explained to me what he had to do regarding the reimbursement with the insurance, and the girl very attentive.

Love FAB! Great bar for entertainment. Established for LGBTQ community but all are welcome and will find something to love about it! Fun DJ’s and music perfect for a night of dancing. Outdoor patio that faces Olive St in Tower District. Cover charge on weekends, not sure about weekdays. Worth the 5 or 10 bucks. Fun drag shows and festive holiday celebrations. Must check out spot if you’ve never been or like the upbeat nightlife.< /text>

<review>Thursday nights are so much fun!  From the go-go dancers the DJ and the drag show this is such a fun place to go on a Thursday night with some friends to drink dance see a show and have fun! Don't forget to tip your drag door lady, she's a lot of fun! Great outdoor area to smoke and relax after some dancing.</review>< pics>

2.5 Stars. This place has the best drag shows in Fresno, friendly bartenders and is moderately priced but their security can be very off-putting. I appreciate that they are keeping us safe so that everyone can have a good time but having a guard posted at the bathroom door seems like a bit much. Also if you're gonna smear Vaseline over all the non-porous surfaces in the bathroom (I assume to prevent drug snorting?) can you please put up a hook so people can hang their bag or coat while they go?</text>

I get that there may be some people who chose to do drugs in the bathroom, but that doesn't mean everyone who spends more than 5 minutes in the bathroom does.< /Review><Date>1530991803468</Date><resp>None<//resp><rate>3<//rate>< Pictures>

Great club. Very low key, which I love. Bartenders, staff, DJ are always amazing! If your looking for a nice small club with amazing people, this is your spot. It's not huge, but it feels like home everytime I go. I recommend it to all. Especially if your just looking for a low key bar with fabulous drag shows, this is your spot.<//Text>

<text>After waiting in line for close to 20 minuets, we walk to restrooms. The security kept looking over the stall and telling everyone to hurry. Short after the security started telling my friend to get out of the restroom accusing him of using drugs. When my friend open the door from the stall, the security pulled him out from his arm to the back exit accusing him of using cocaine in front of everyone. When ask for the manager and owner. He told us that my friend was able to come back next day and the security was right. We can understand the rudeness policy of this place and why if where drug consumption the police where not present. Instead, the security was allowed to put hands on people. Not coming back!!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Now I feel like I can't chill out without some bouncer questioning and staring me and my friends down and lingering around waiting to find us at fault for what? Havin fun? That killed the buzz vibe Fab. Long time cummer since you first opened your legs. Don't feel comfortable coming to this place no more. Fab used to represent expressionism to me...no longer a place to feel and be myself...</Review></record></dataset><record>

There is no AC in the building and it’s in an extremely hot city. The workers are forced to be in the heat with no air circulation. Especially with the masks I don’t know how they don’t overheat. The manager needs to get it fixed for the employees asap but has ignored it. The workers however are great and are very friendly. Briana took care of me and was super nice to me!< /Review>

They did a really good job on the scrambled eggs in the deluxe breakfast. The French toast sticks weren't very good. But I think it was a very good choice for a fast food breakfast.< /Review>

The food at Jack in the box is what it is. You know that each store is going to be exactly like the last. This store in the early morning hours is primarily driven by the drive through. It is very busy. I walked in the store and was greeted by the young lady at the drive through window with a smile. I walked straight to the restroom. It needs attention but at least it is clean. I walked back out and the polite young lady from the drive through came to the counter and took my order. The condiment counter was clean and in good order. She handed me my order and wished me a great day. This location, at least in the morning, has fantastic service.</Review>

It was typical for a JITB. It could be cleaner, they could make more of a customer service effort. The food is tasty and the burgers are always a bit different than the sea of burger places flooding into California.

It would be nice if corporate would put an effort into getting back to basics. Oh well...</Review>

A quiet, clean, fast jack in the box. I normally get the tacos and on more than on occasion I have gotten ones that look picture perfect. The workers have always been friendly no matter the hour.<//review>

<Review>This location is fast and local, however outside of that the food is inconsistent in taste and how it's prepared.  Add to that how much Jack in the Box costs compared to some other places and it's bordering on 2 stars for me.  Sadly, I will probably continue to order from here on the days I'm lazy and don't want to have to drive far and want my food quickly.</Review>< Response>

I was traveling to Disneyland yesterday morning and I stopped at this location to get a bite to eat... I ordered a burrito I asked for egg whites and was told they don't have any... I have location have egg whites but ok... so I was going to pay with cash... as I am going to Disneyland I decided to use my card. I have an issue with my strip however it works the manager was sliding my card and I asked for her just to do it slowly and she ignored me... as a matter of fact she was antagonizing me... and I walked out...< /text>

<Text>Great service. Went looking for a sale item, the butcher made up several packages for me after noticing they had sold all in the cooler. Great guy!
Going through the self serve check out the attendant was very helpful helping me find a lookup item. Very helpful and courteous.<//Text>< username>

<Review>Clean, modern, on point, trendy Safeway with everything you could ever want and more.  Whether it's fresh seafood, hot freshly baked breads, crisp fresh fruit and vegetables, amazing floral department and so much more, this store had it.  This is a flagship store and it shows in spades, they get it and they work hard to create an experience better than most of not so grocery stores.  This is the new standard and high bar offering convenience and quality you can't find elsewhere.< /Review>< pictures>

Can't even give 1 star,and I shop this store all the time.I bought chicken tenders at in store counter granted it was $5.00 fri.this past wk.Iwas having a couple of people so I bought several lbs. When I went to serve ( 20 min.later) they were hard so much batting and so dry the people couldn't eat them.I had to put together a meat with the salads and sides I was serving.I will never buy them again there.Not to mention I had to tell them from Safeway on Hamilton in Campbell.I am hoping some one callsl me back or at least e-mails me.   In order to post this I had to give 1 star .<//review>

<review>Safeway shops well.  The employees are good about wearing masks and keeping distance. They are also accurate in their shopping. I prefer the curbside pick up over delivery by the other guys.  Thank you!< /review><user_id>111865391356714192848<//user_id><name>James Shearer< /name>< Time>

We have been here 3 times to get curbside pickup and each time we had to return because we were missing from 3 to 10 items that we had ordered and paid for.  Also, we requested "No Substitution" on many items but were substituted anyway.  $6.49 for Asian Celery when we ordered regular celery!  Come on man!!!  Management needs to pay more attention and do better training.  We can't be the only ones experiencing this problem</Text>

My favorite store, and the location has everything I need for my family from known brands and awesome Rewards prices, to my favorite Starbucks beverages and great Chinese fast food! Then add to that the convenience of a gasoline station on site and up to a $1/gallon off with my Rewards!!< /review>

The young man in the deli department helped my wife and I find an item in the store that other store employees thought that Safeway wasn't carrying at this time. He didn't give up until he found what we were looking for. Because of the extraordinary help we we received, we will be returning the Safeway many times in the future.<//text>

<text>Store is spacious, clean and stocked as well as it can be. Kennia, Drew and Sarah&Salvatore are very helpful and efficient.  Rita and Dennis are wonderful slicing my meat and cheese in the deli.
A lot of good deals, great gift card selection, greeting cards and floral designs.
Starbucks is conveniently located in the store where Kali is so nice and quick to serve coffee.
The bakery has a variety of cake slices, breads, brownies, etc that are so yummy.  The fresh strawberry filled white sheet cake is delicious too.
A one stop grocery place.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

This Safeway is very nicely kept and organized. I have never had any issues with employees but I can't say the same for the neighborhood shoppers. They are not very friendly and by the looks and vibes given by them they dislike outsiders.</text>

If I could I would have given this safeway a -10 rating & zero stars.. went by to pick up a few things. Made it outside to my car. Had pulled up on the corner right next to the tables & chairs. Loaded my car & left the cart right on the corner (right on the other side of where they put collected carts)..then a short, dark haired employee aggressively grab the cart & with a very rude & Condescending Attitude said "couldn't have put the cart closer huh" while shaking their head. I was completely shocked. 1st of all I'm pretty sure its your job as a cart collector to grab the carts and if you're so miserable at doing your job then you shouldn't be in a customer service position. Then on top of that, they had the nerve to wave & say again with a very Snotty & rude Attitude "have a nice day" as I drove away. Will not be returning to this safeway< /text>

This Safeway is one of the biggest and cleanest stores that I have ever seen.  Their inventory is simply amazing with an incredible selection to choose from.  Not to  mention their great customer service.  Kudos to the management for having a superb staff.  This is why I don't patronize other similar companies.<//Review>

< review>
This Safeway is laid out completely different from all the other stores...and it just doesn't flow at all. The vibe there is funky...its pretty busy there, and the checkers are not really trying to get you out of there quickly. It is limited in what it carries, and it isn't stocked well. I wasn't really able to get what I wanted cuz they only had part of the things I needed. Its just not like the Stevens Creek and Lawrence Expressway  store...that store is awesome.  I miss shopping there.<//review>

<Review>I lived next to this Safeway for 4 years and it always had the essentials I needed even during the crazy holiday madness. Not sure what's changed since I left 3 years ago but the staff here was always friendly and parking is usually pretty easy to find even during rush hour or over the weekend.</Review><gmapID>0x808e3534482af8f3:0x3521a93a2e52b487<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The self checkout machines are older and confusing if you are used to the newer ones. Also the produced department, although well stocked, seems to be randomly shelved for lack of refrigeration space.</Review>

< Review>
It’s a ginormous grocery store that has almost everything you need.  Good sales, but a bit expensive if the item is not on sale.  And well stocked!  But good goddess it takes  foreeeeeever to check out.  Like, add 20 minutes to your trip because there is never enough check out people.  Ever.  We stop here a couple times a week at different hours and days, so there is plenty of time variation on our experiences. Well stocked stores don’t mean ish, if people can’t shop without taking a loan out from Father Time.  Don’t be so stingy Safeway, and put an extra cashier on the floor.< /Review>

<review>24 hours! Daytime shopping is excellent. Usually well stocked. Friendly service. Good parking! Has multiple fun "car" double carts for people with kids. Docked a star for evening shopping. 24 hour location, but starts restock at 9pm. Couldn't get around the store well, multiple aisles blocked to the point I couldn't fit my body through, let alone a cart.< /review>< pics>

<Date>1515626835473< /Date><Review>This Safeway is one of the nicest around.
Big and clean with a great selection.
This location has a bakery, deli, pharmacy, and floral department. There is an on site butcher and an in-store Starbucks and lounge area as well.
The produce, bakery and deli are always fresh. Customer service is Excellent.
Parking is abundant and there is also a large Safeway fueling gas station on the opposite end of the parking lot.< /Review><rate>5< /rate><Name>David Sandoval</Name><response>None<//response>< Pictures>

Went to regular checkout at night and was told that I have to use self-service unless I buy alcohol. Lots of fun with several items of produce, machine complaining that I need assistance, usual. So I guess I need to start drinking to not have to be my own checker.< /Text>

<review>They closed the door before 6:50pm on Christmas eve when they said close at 7pm.
There were like 5 groups of people just needed to grab one or two things only which won't take more than 5 minutes! We complained but they refused to open the door. They just want to go home early. SUCK!< /review><Rate>1</Rate>< time>

Nice newer store. Well organized. Prices are not that great unless it is on special. But the worst part is it is excruciatingly difficult to check out. Every time I go there long lines clogging the checkout. Last time I went all self-checkout computers went down while I was in line. Employees just kept putting paper bags over the monitors.< /review>

Good Safeway.  Not as good as the other Safeway in town ( Hamilton Ave. ) and they are usually out of a lot of things.  I rarely shop here but when I do I go for the usual items which they usually have, but if you want  specific items definitely shop at the one on Hamilton Ave.< /Review>

Customer service getting worse. No baggers. Checkers have to bag the groceries. Card swipe/chip reader times out due to checker having to bag groceries. If you like incompetence, then this is the store for you.</review>

This is one of Safeway's nicer markets.  Open till 1am, its convenient for most anyone.  It has a fantastic selection of quality produce, an onsite butcher, nice selection of fish, and a wide array of general groceries and home sundries.  They also have a competitively priced gas station.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed.<//review>

Your store Hamilton is a disaster.  No ad items on the shelves.   Ask a clerk if you can find one and they give you a rude answer.   This store has a lot of problems.  The problems  today are not the first time I have encountered problems in this store.   You better look at your help including the manager.< /Review>

<Text>Made an online order with delivery in two days. At the time they supposed to deliver they called and told me that they cannot deliver due to a high demand (didn't they know the demand at the time I ordered?). They suggested me to reorder with next day morning delivery. After hanging up I tried to make another order, but all the slots were taken for several days.</Text>< pictures>

One of the rare Safeway locations with a Gas Station, new store format with a very large deli including a Starbucks and a sushi counter.  No bank inside, but there is a Citibank branch in the Plaza. Lots of parking.  The customer service is good and friendly.  But you may want to check expiration dates,  I found several packages in the lunch meats that were expired.</text>

<text>This paricular Safeway (Hamilton Ave) has gone seriously downhill over the last year. Stocking in all key areas  (produce, meats, dairy & eggs) has become horrible. Literally every week they come up short on 30 to 50% of items that are being advertised. In a recent visit looking for an advertised special on cage free eggs I came across a completely vacant egg display with about 1/2 dozen customers all wondering what the heck was going on. I got a senior store rep ( looked like the overall store manager ) and asked for help. He flat out said "sorry, I don't have anyone to help you right now". Not one to be shy about pressing, I did. He denied providing any help again, leaving an aisle full of customers with looks of confusion. I hate writing reviews but it's time this place started getting help to run right. Note: I have talked to MANY line level employees in all the areas I mentioned above and every one tells me they order what they need but that management and the warehouse routinely screw them. That leaves them making promises to customers that they have zero ability to ensure are kept.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
This place doesn't really carry what I want anymore and when I asked him to order it they told me they would but then it turned out that they decided not to and didn't bother to tell me. The night manager here is rather surly and unhelpful in fact I think she should be fired immediately or at least sent back for retraining.

The store has not improved at all. In fact it's actually managed to get worse. You go to the deli counter to get help and the employees just sit there and stare at you and ignore you. They never have what you want. this store is horrible and I do not understand anybody that gives it a good review these people must be lying< /Review>

Clean store. Nicely laid out.  Not much interaction with employees as not enough employees on the floor.< /review>

Cashier lines are always waaaay too long and a lot more could be done to improve them and open up extra lanes to get lots of customers out more quickly.  The gas station machines need a lot of work as well and are slow if they happen to work so you can take advantage of your Safeway gas points.  Lines are confusing when they get too long as you need to circle around the back parking lot by the Consignment store to line up and you may be forced to parallel park or use a pump with the hose on the opposite side of where you gas tank is located even though you can stretch the hoses but a bit tougher for an SUV.  They also never seem to have the items listed on sale on the app even when this is marked as your home store.< /Text>

I was very pleased with Safeway employees who helped find certain items. Especially, at the meat dept the employees very pleasant and helpful. They were courteous and friendly I appreciate they assisted me accordingly.
I as a customer am very concerned about what Wal-Mart's mass lay off which I think greed beyond comprehension so I am boycotting Wal-Mart! So it is very helpful when Safeway employees are friendly and courteous.</text>

This used to be a great safeway, but in the last year it has gone way downhill.  I went for flowers & what they had on display were wilted and dying.  Half the time lately they don't even have what I am looking for.  Just an empty spot where the item "was".</text>

My go-to local Safeway.
It's nicer and has a better selection than the one on Winchester, and the staff is usually pretty friendly.
I prefer to shop here after 9pm because I hate crowds 😊</Review>

Nice, newer large Safeway with a gas station.  However, the selection of organic fruits and vegetables is less than 25 percent of what is available at the Cottle Road location. They also do not have a section for organic dried fruits. Some other departments are also a bit thin for the size of the store. If you are in the area the Cottle Road location is where you want to shop.< /text>

Pretty decent but going downhill I think. As they try to do more, they don’t carry as much as they used to. And don’t go on a Sunday. Nothing is in stock. Pitiful.</Review>

Checking out is also a huge hassle here. There are usually a few self-service machines that are not working. As a result, there is always a line for them, as well as the line for checkout with a cashier.<//Review>

As a newer development I think its generally cleaner and more organized them some of the other locations. Prices are comparable to any other big chain grocery store and there is a lot of floor space allowing for a a good selection of most common items. There is a lot of parking and even a gas station in the same lot so its a rather convenient stop.< /review><user_name>Jeff Streit<//user_name><resp>None</resp>< Date>

My online order was NOT delivered in the designated 4 HOUR timeframe, and the 1877 customer support kept asking me to call 3 DIFFERENT Safeways in my area, none of which could help with delivery issues.

The Safeway at Budd and Winchester is pathetic. No carts available at the entrance, produce looks like leftovers, sale items on shelves are always gone, deli is pathetic with no one there to ever help you, bakery never has anything but French bread. Butcher shop is top notch, the only part of the whole store that seems to know what they're doing. Then you go to check out. 15 people in both lines! BOTH lines! They never have more than 2 lines open. Disgusting waste of time to go there.< /text>

Hamilton Ave Campbell used to be a very nice store but changed 1-2 years ago. Now Each time I ask myself Why should I keep coming when it is so frustrating to shop. I've been a customer of Safeway for about 40 years spending $150 - $200 per week. So disappointed and frustrated.<//review>

The thing I really like about this Safeway is that they have a lot of great food and I will have a fresh food and you know the other thing is is that they have lots of great fruit that's been chopped up for you so you can just go and get a quick bite to eat and run out the door<//text>

Safeway's (ALL) in general need more staff! It's ridiculously crowded at check out stands.
This is my local Safeway and I'd much rather travel to a different location to shop. The lines are ridiculously long, I mean the quality of professional staff is little to none. Not to mention, the staff members complaining of being "short staffed" to their customers. This of course is a personnal issue and should be fixed with management but sadly is not. They do "stocking" during odd hours which of course lead to packed isles. The butcher is ruud! The produce selection is scattered.
SIMPLY AVOID THIS SAFEWAY. That is all.</text>

I wish Safeway had a competition .. I have YET!! To get all I ordered, and mostly is the things I REALLY NEED causing me to go to the store I tried to avoid. The longer I use them the worst they become!! I complained multiple times so they give me credit for FUTURE shopping which Mensa NOTHING. I need this service as I am not allowed to carry heavy things .. if I had a choice I would not use them!!!< /Review>

Went in on Sunday 6pm, half the veggies were completely gone. It reminded me of grocery stores during natural disasters.</text>

I wish Safeway had a competition .. I have YET!! To get all I ordered, and mostly is the things I REALLY NEED causing me to go to the store I tried to avoid. The longer I use them the worst they become!! I complained multiple times so they give me credit for FUTURE shopping which Mensa NOTHING. I need this service as I am not allowed to carry heavy things .. if I had a choice I would not use them!!!<//Review>

<Name>James Jackson<//Name><resp>None< /resp><rating>2<//rating><Time>1521607848366< /Time><Text>Terrible customer service at the deli. One employee behind the counter declined to help me, saying it was "not her job" to serve mac and cheese even though she was standing right next to it and no other employee was available. Meanwhile, I waited literally 20 minutes while another particularly inept employee struggled to make two sandwiches for the only other customer at the deli. I just moved to California from out-of-state last week and had never been in a Safeway before. I have no intention of visiting this location again.< /Text></record>

Long lines. Cramped parking lot. Too much stuff in the aisles, creating traffic jams. Very erratic about availability of items. They put displays at the end of the checkout lanes so you can't pull your cart up to unload. It all makes for a miserable customer experience. Go elsewhere.</text>

Very expensive comparing to Sprout. There is a small market called Oakmont pretty close to Safeway. They are way cheaper than safeway in terms of fruit and vegetables. Safeway has more options of course. Youncan still find cheap stuff in safeway too. It all depends what you are going to buy basically.<//text>

No christmas stamps and the guy was going to charge me for stamps even before he was sure if he had christmas stamps,then explained how that wasnt a good idea because if he didnt have christmas stamps he'd have to do a return, im not sure why he cant check the drawer beforehand to find out if the product is even available, but he was annoyed when i reiterated i only wanted christmas stamps once i realized he was charging me for them before knowing if he had any, this guy must have been tired! But still poor customer service sucks. then the lady at customer service helped me with my question about christmas stamps 'before' the gentleman that was already waiting in line in front of me, aaarrrggg, it was like a zoo last night<//Text>

This used to be an Andronicos.  It's still very much the same, except the items and prices are similar to a regular Safeway except smaller so some items are not available.<//text>

I really only go here because it is close to my home. The aisles are constantly cluttered with DUMB displays that prevent accessing items or just having 2 way traffic. If not that then workers are stocking up or doing inventory. (This is between 9am and noon on weekends.) Prices are high too.

While some of the cashiers are great (fast and friendly) others just don't give a darn and are more concerned with their "shift ending in 10 minutes" or just look around instead bagging/checking. I even scolded one after her "put one item in a bag then look around" routine hit 5 times.

I didn't have this low opinion when the store was on winchester and payne.<//text>

Ailes are narrow and packed with boxes makes it difficult to pass each other or it basically one lane

The fruits and vegitables are poorly arranged and inefficient

They have electrical problems. I get shocked at least 3-4 times every time I go there, especially in the produce area. This safeway is the closest grocery store to me but I will now be going out of my way to shop elsewhere.</text>

(Translated by Google) Safeway unmanned cash registers have poor performance. Moreover, the point of the male assistant who manages the unmanned cash register is also bad at this store.
