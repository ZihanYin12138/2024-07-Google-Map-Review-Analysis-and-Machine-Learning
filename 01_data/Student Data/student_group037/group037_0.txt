They get you in fast. Can take a full day to get your dogs back. Cuts are good. But when I say please do a bear cut or bear face on my Maltese or poodle they come back with short square mustaches.  They look ugly lol. But it will grow back.  But they always try to schedule you in asap. And thats awesome< /Review>

<review>I've taken my dog many places trying to find the right fit. I have found it. He comes back smelling great, looking good and best of all stress free. I would recommend to give this place a try. Very professional.</review><gmapID>0x80905136c83abe23:0x90f22377a426b18d</gmapID></record>

<Review>It's impossible for me to trim my dogs nails and I needed help. I called and got an appointment right away. Angella is amazing, she's so loving and caring with the pets, she took care of my pretty girl who was shaking in fear (she hates having her paws touched). She's such a professional, she was done super quick and by the time she was finished, my dog was wagging her tail again. I'll definitely be going back!<//Review>< rating>

I found them via Google. I liked the reviews & the photos seemed nice. I called & was able to get a sameday appointment on a Saturday. So at the sceduled time, drove across town to drop our dog off for grooming. Upon arrival I was asked for the dogs shot records, which I did not think to bring with me.

We usually take our dog to another groomer but being that they were booked far in advance, I was just wanting to get our dog groomed since he was past due.

So here I was standing with dog in hand, being refused service because I didn't bring the paperwork with me. It is not a habit to take the dog's medical records with me every time I go out.

Their facility isn't as appears in the Google search results. Actually looks like they've down-sized & the dogs are in little random fenced areas.

Being a business who does this every day, they should make it a standard practice to notify new customers of what to bring with on the first visit.

So hence the 2-star rating. People don't need to be misled or misinformed, especially when it wastes their time/weekend.< /Text>

<Name>Nae Lambert< /Name><Text>This was my first time bringing my golden-doodle and I only brought her here due to a last minute cancellation. I called around because doodles are pricey and this place seemed cheap for a bath! I brought her in for a bath only and couldn’t believe the smell! I literally thought I stepped in dog $hit, hair all over the place and dogs just locked up in kennels (not one dog 4 dogs in a small kennel) the girl said she was running behind so it will take 4-5 hrs until she would be ready. I said ok it was 2pm when I dropped her off. I called around 7 and the girl was so rude saying she will call me when she was done that she hasn’t even started her?! When I picked her up around 9:30pm there where so many dogs still locked in kennels I asked if they where there being boarded she said NO just waiting for the owners to pick them up!!! I was shocked that the dog owners would leave them there for that long!!! They did an ok job!
Now my second time bringing her here seemed a little cleaner and less dogs. This time I needed a full on groom (haircut, nails cut, ear hair removal ect) I dropped her off and asked how long she said 4-5 hours depending on how matted her fur was( it wasn’t bad) I explained to the girl what happened last time with the time and she said they weren’t busy and had a helper. So I showed up 5hrs later and was told she was almost done if I could wait out in the car, because my dog wouldn’t want to sit still. ( I thought ok that kinda makes sense) I thought I was going to die watching them comb her out!! They where just ripping her hair out and I could tell it was hurting her! I walked inside and said your done to stop! The girl that was combining her replied it just looks that way, I promise it doesn’t hurt her! When I left my poor baby smelled like dog pi$$ and a wet dirty dog! Within a few days my dog had rashes all over her body, her eyes where red her ears looked red and swollen and her nose was pealing! So I had to take her to the vet and the veterinarian asked where did you have her grommed at? I told her where and she looked at me and said I see!!  If they don’t sanitize there clippers and other gromming supplies this will happen! My dog had a bad ear and eye infection razor burn from the clippers she was a mess! I called and complained about the treatment of my dog and what had happened at the vet. The girl that answered the phone said “there’s no way this all happened to your dog from just getting groomed” are you kidding me WOW  “if your so upset then just to find another groomer” not even a sorry!! I guess if you want your dog to smell worse then it did before you brought it here, have awful customer service, and don’t mind your dog being neglected this is the place for YOU!!! I honestly should have known to to bring her back after the first experience, but I did so I blame myself!!< /Text><Date>1515981991845</Date><rate>1< /rate>< Gmap_id>

I celebrated my graduation today in this excellent restaurant. I am glad to say that we had a pleasant evening and the venue was indeed the reason for that happy gathering. The team  collaborated in a sweet way, the meals were great and my guests were extremely  joyful. We shall surely return for more joyful events. thanks very much.</Text>

This time was extremely different. I called ahead to place my order. I asked them point blank "how long will my order take?"  The waitress told me 30 minutes. I said that's fine and placed my order. I got there 25 minutes later.  I paid for my order and was informed that it wasn't ready. I asked her how much longer, she informed in another 15 minutes. I told her I'll wait in my car. More than 15 minutes had passed and I went to get my order. She said it still wasn't ready. I asked her how much longer, she informed me another 10 minutes. I asked her if she was joking. I said when I placed my order over the phone, I was informed it would be ready in 30 minutes. It waited over 40 minutes and it still wasn't ready and they wanted me to wait another 10 minutes. She couldn't even guarantee that after 10 minutes it would be ready.  I asked her for a refund and I left. The food was not worth waiting for an hour. Called another restaurant to place my order. They gave me an accurate estimate of when my food was ready and by the time I arrived the order was waiting for me. Won't be back here anytime soon. They don't seem to know how to estimate. If they tell you 10 minutes expect 20. If they say 30 minutes expect 60 minutes.</Review>< Rating>

Won Ton Soup - Broth was very bland and not flavorful.  Wontons were better, good balance of wonton wrapper and filling, and the filling was moderately tasty and not gristly at all, great consistency.  Other ingredients (bok choi and carrots) were fresh and cooked well.  Overall, 3/5 stars for this dish

Beef Chow Fun - Good amount of beef and it was tender, but a little bland.  Noodles were well covered in sauce and not all stuck together with white parts inside.  Sauce was on the bland side.  Adding soy helped a lot.  3/5 stars

Mongolian Beef - Generous portion.  Very, very salty; it ended up mixing well with the chow fun (rice would have probably worked too) but I think I would have had a hard time eating it straight.  Nice heat kick at the end.  2/5 stars.

Service was friendly, 4/5 stars< /text>

<review>Went here and was ignored by the lady taking orders. She made eye contact with me and then turned back around and proceeded to ignore me until I left (around 5 minutes). Furthermore, there were 2 people cooking in the kitchen BOTH not wearing masks! During a pandemic people should feel confident that the food they're getting is as safe as possible! Not only is preparing food without a mask highly unethical but ILLEGAL as well! Don't give this place your business. There are plenty of other worthy business who need your support.</review>< user_id>

Lady waited 8 actual minutes with her back turned on the phone prior to taking my order, the only two employees making food were both not wearing a mask, and the food was poor with long wait times. Terrible restaurant DONT GO HERE (Also fake reviews to boost stars just look at that ratio)<//review>

<Review>There's a lot of pretty mediocre Chinese places in CA .  PEOPLEs is some of the best I've found for delivery, can't really beat the sit down dim sum places though.  Warning though, I think the best dishes have a ton of chili heat.  Like, several cups of whole dried red chili peppers just everywhere.  I don't know what kind of pepper they are but they have a great flavor.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808f86491b9ed3e7:0xa16fd8e073264cad</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Out of the couple of times we ordered from them, only one meal was prepared right. Well i know everyone will have there own opinion. But i think some people dont care were they eat. Just go inside and see how they treat they're food and customers. Is unacceptable its your stomach and its your choice what you put in your stomach.. Happy hunting</Review>

<text>DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. After not receiving my delivery order, I called the restaurant. They said they had tried to call and text me, which they never had. They SCREAMED at me on the phone. I legitimately made a yelp account, just for the purpose of writing a review for King Kong because the man I spoke to was so verbally abusive. They shouldn't be allowed to be in business if they want to use that sort of disgusting and rude language and service. Not only did I go through the most horrific customer service experience of my life, but they refused to refund me me.</text><GmapID>0x808f86491b9ed3e7:0xa16fd8e073264cad<//GmapID></record>

Ever since the business was sold and egg rolls got 4 times more expensive and food got was less delicious I've vowed to never go back. Money hungry owners plus no care or quality of their food or service. What am I paying extra for????< /Review>

Great tasting Chinese food. There's never a line, but you get served right away. Many options and the staff will cook anything you might want that's not on the hot table< /Text>

Everything was awesome. Sorry to quote the Lego movie. But I am always happy with the food here. Unlike other Chinese food restaurants in the area, i never feel gross afterwards.</review>

< Review>
I always order delivery from these guys, because there good. last night I ordered chicken veggie soup chicken cow mein and house fried rice, the rice was good as always and so was the soup, I went to scoop up some chow mein with my fork, I look down at my bowl and there is a damn roach inside my bowl. Never again will I order from King Kong. Very disappointing, when I thought I found a good Chinese spot this happens. Never again<//Review>

Food is "ok" quality, not great. Overall, not the freshest or most delicious, but it will do if you're hungry. Pricing is a bit high for ok quality.<//Text>

It's like a cheap Chinese food place that's not very clean, except it's not very cheap, either. Two people for lunch wound up around 30 dollars.  Ouch.  Food was mediocre,  though the deep fried prawns were good. Beef in the beef and broccoli was mostly gristle. Cup for tea had clearly not been washed well, as there were dried lip marks on it. They have one bathroom,  and it's not marked in any way (I had to ask). The only reason we went to this place was that it was open on Christmas and we had a Chinese food jones. Not recommended, even if you have a Chinese food jones.<//text>

Food is off the chain. Worth the price to me both for portion and quality and I'm a career kitchen queen....pretty quick and courteous delivery...recommend the shrimp dumplings, lemon chicken and crab wonton.  Thank you KKBBQ.< /review>

Ordered food for delivery. Called 50mins later to see where our food was, got told it was on its way. Called 20mins after that to find out there was no food on the way and they had forgotten our order! So our food finally arrived an hour and a half after originally ordering. Not happy we were so hungry by then!</Review>

So I go in and there is a lady yelling at a customer on the phone, she sees me then just turns back around. There is also another lady folding wontons on the non covered table surface. I waited for 6 minutes. Finally she takes my order. Worst ever, she charged me for white that I didnt get. This place is super run down now I will never go to this place again. Also they make fake profiles to boost their stars.<//text>

The food is good but the person taking my husband’s order on the phone was extremely rude and dismissive. We will not be ordering from this restaurant again.< /review>

Would you guy eat something like this? Soggy, old,all soaked up in oil kind of fries? Really ? Is this so appetizing? As a worker maybe you should ask yourself “would I eat something that looks like this” before even bagging up the food and handing it out to customers. I believe you as a person would like for your food to look and taste as good as it looks right?<//text>

< review>
90% of the time, the food here would be freshly cooked. 10%, it’ll feel microwaved but I guess that depends on what time you go. Never had to wait more than 5 min if there’s 3 cars. But over that, be prepared. It gets super busy evening to night! I live near a Robertitos and Maria’s, but always drive the extra 5 min to order here because there’s just MORE amount and it’s tastier, especially the asada fries (plenty of meat/ cheese) and burritos (they’re fat).
One thing that BOTHERS me every time is the sound quality of their drive-thru speaker–it’s so loud, full of static, and not as clear as other drive thru. It’s also placed near chestnut street so they can’t really hear you unless you speak louder than usual.<//review>

This place makes great veggie burritos! The rice is so flavorful and the size of this thing is 😧 huge! Okay so when you arrive the place is a little off putting, but inside they make amazing food! There is always a line here so you know the food is good. Don't worry about the line they are quick about getting your food ready.<//review>

UGH!! Words cannot describe how disgusted and disappointed I am! This doesn’t even deserve 1 star, if I can give it 0 stars I would! Usually I receive everything perfectly when this one guy takes my order, but I went today and a different girl took my order. My fries looked like they were DRENCHED in oil and they were SOO SOGGY! You can literally see the oil on the fries! It’s literally glistening, it’s SO NASTY! I am so disappointed! I hope they don’t serve this to other customers! Just look at this!! Would you eat this?! I don’t think so!<//review>

<text>My husband and I love the asada fries here. This is the only location we get our asada fries. There are times where our fries wouldn't be fully fried and still kinda starchy. That definitely kills the plate. Depending on the person grabbing the sauce, they could be pretty stingy or nice. I don't know anyone who can eat asada fries with only 2 hot sauce. My husband and I like our asada fries covered with 2 red sauce and 2 green sauce at the least. (Our personal taste)< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

< review>
The carne asada has no flavor and looks like it went through a meat grinder. The tortillas are very dry. The pico de gallo is nearly all onions. The guacamole tastes like it came out of a can. The food is basically barely edible at all. My woman gave most of hers to the dog. Needless to say, we won't be going back. For the prices they charge, the quality is extremely poor.<//review>

Lines can get pretty long and sometimes you have to wait 30-45 mins. What keeps me coming back is the delicious carnitas . This Arsenios is also pretty generous with their meat. I live closer to the kings canyon one but drive to this one because the food here is tastier and the people are nicer.< /Review>

<Review>Horrible & watery plain "guac sauce" nothing authentic about it. Sloooow drive thru service, Subpar food offering in the nachos, where were the onions, cilantro and tomatoes? Geez, the good things were the tender carne asada, the red sauce and the sweet young lady at the window. Come on, get some real authentic guacamole in there, just charge extra, your loyal patron's will appreciate and buy it!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Don't judge  book by the cover.  This place is great.
I usually have thr super burrito with Chile Verde and have them add an egg.  My favorite in town. It easily will feed 2 people. The
employees are always very friendly .</Text>

Never had a problem here and I've been eating at this location since I can remember! I'm 19 now and still go here to get the asada fries, super nacho, or some burritos or tacos. Delicious. It's in a decent area so you don't have to worry about anyone bothering you if you're sitting at the outside tables. Maybe needs some exterior renovations, but it's about the food that counts. 👍< /Text>

Empty drive through. Spent ten minutes waiting for food. Four cars in line behind me now. Had to leave without food because my lunch is only so long.< /Review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Long wait time!!! I pulled up to order and no one was answering despite me asking hello for like 5 minutes. So I continued through the line and SIXTEEN minutes later I got to the window, and the girl asked me to pay 19 something but I let her know that I never got to order because no one was answering and told me I had to get back in line to order. WASTE OF TIME. Maple and Kings Canyon is so much better.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Never disappointed at this location but I’ll never come back on Sunday night. Repeated my ordered two times at the speaker saying I wanted 3 mediums only to find out she got me down for 3 minis. ☹️ She repeated my order again at the window but not in person but behind the window in a low voice instead so I thought it was right and said yes. Came home to find that she never gave me any green sauce too. I was hungry soo I left with the 3 mini’s anyways. Hopefully next time around she’ll speak in a louder tone.< /Review><date>1580709861592< /date>< resp>

<Review>Disrespectful, ignorant, and unprofessional. Worker got my order completely wrong and  refused to answer any of my questions. Rosie (the manager as she claims) was absolutely the worst!! If she treats customers this way, I can't even imagine how her employees act. 👎🏻<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Was incredibly angry, and disgusted, to find that the food my family had been eating contains a WHOLE, COOKED, DEAD FLY...  Wondering how we found out?.... My DAUGHTER felt something unusual ON HER TONGUE WHILE CONSUMING A FORK OF FOOD.  Thank goodness she recognized something wasn't right, and SPIT THE DEAD FLY OUT OF HER MOUTH...

Restaurant associate had no compassion, just coldly advised to contact Door Dash for a refund, and as a courtesy, because of my continuous request for immediate resolution while at the restaurant that I'd driven all the way back to,  would provide my family with a free order of carne asada flies...fries* due to my dissatisfaction..

Verry disappointing.  We will not be eating from this food chain again.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Had a friend perform here and stopped by to check it out...  it was a great slice of community theater.  The props and performances were great and the staff was very friendly during the meet n greet after the play.

Wouldn't mind checking out some of their other shows.< /review>< Date>

Had an amazing evening during the Fringe Festival here!  I have walked by this building many times, but never had a reason to go in.  It's very old inside, but in that charming kind of way.  There seems to be multiple venues of varying size inside the building.  The only downside while we were here is that the elevator was broken, and the performance we were going to was on the top (4th or 5th?) floor.  The staircases seemed endless.  There was a really neat rooftop stage, where I imagine they hold some pretty neat performances.

The stage that we went to had about 50 chairs inside, with the stage set up front.  The sound and lighting was good, and the performance was amazing (Around the World in 80 Years).

Overall, this seems like an awesome venue.  I look forward to seeing more performances here!< /text>

<Text>I purchased a JDM van from Top Rank in November of 2020. The process took a little longer than I expected, but given that there has been a raging pandemic it made sense. Steve and Brian were great to work with, never pressuring me and always answering my questions and sending me additional photos.

I live 3000 miles away and with the pandemic I was unable to view the car in person. Top Rank had no problems with me engaging a 3rd party vehicle inspection service to look at the van on my behalf. This inspection gave me peace of mind and I cant recommended it higher.

The paperwork process took a few extra days due to shipping delays (virus related) but I received all the documents necessary to register/insure the vehicle in Massachusetts. The van arrived in about 9 days via Top Ranks shipping partner.

The condition of the van was exactly as it was described in the advertisement on the website.

I am over the moon with my purchase and experience with Top Rank Importers. I really love the van as its exactly what they listed.

Top Rank set my mind at ease when it came to purchasing a vehicle sight unseen. I have never had such an enjoyable, relaxing experience purchasing a vehicle from a dealer before.

Thank you Steve and Brian< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkfgnhRS7FkmnPMgKr2eWmgBEhFx7yL45lB2Y5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMXIs7VKXiRrfbHGCZHYlQa3huqkAEIZ0ua1gL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dd322e794cbe85:0xd968430344698403<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have not yet purchased a vehicle from Toprank but I am currently in talks with the business, and I can personally vouch for great timely responses by Brian. And very informative info, Brian has helped me with many of the questions I had regarding California regulations on GTR’s, hoping to get one in through them in the near future. Thanks guys!!<//text>

In before they say this is a fake review. I got screen shots of their very "professional" customer service before Sean Morris deleted our conversation.

One of the best places to buy imported gray market and domestic cars in the whole US. Ive done business with them serval times and each time has been outstanding. The attention the detail and customer service is top notch. If you’re looking for a specific car, they will do their best to get it as long it fits within the legal guidelines.<//text>

Super cool people. They have all the JDM cars we dream of, and can also make them California legal. Recommend to anyone looking to buy a supra,rx7,nsx,GTR, or anything rhd from japan.</review>

I recently purchased a 1995 Skyline R33 GTR V-Spec in midnight purple. Right from the beginning I was sent a ton of very detailed images of the vehicle on the lift in Japan right after it was purchased.I was also sent a record of the maintenance and repairs performed after they acquired the vehicle and inspected it themselves.  Car was exceptionally clean. Fast forward to it arriving in the states they were able to facilitate some of their connections to help me build it the way I wanted and properly. Sean Morris helped guide me in that direction and answer a flood of all my questions in extreme detail. Yaska and Brian are eager to help in anyway they can during this process and let me tell you , if they say something they mean it. The whole team delivers high quality 25 year old JDM imports . I live in NY and our DMV are terrible during regular transactions. The paperwork sent by Top Rank had all of the needed information including path of ownership that I was able to drop it all off at DMV ( no in person due to covid) and it went through seamless and had plates and registration in a week. The wealth of knowledge that comes from this team should make it the only choice when it comes to purchasing an Import. The car arrived to me and it was more than I even expected. I could not find 1 flaw with this car. It leaks nothing, it looks brand new and not 1 spot of rust or oxidation in the engine bay. Im highly satisfied with the quality of the purchase I made and also for the experience I had with the team helping deliver some dreams. These are all great guys and I couldn't ask for anything more.< /text>

I was not able to get approved for the financing on the car I wanted in the end but the people at Toprank and the people that do there financing were really helpful though out the whole process. I will be back for an R32 soon for sure!</Text>

I bought a car from the picture alone.  It took a little bit of time to arrange the shipping, but it was only about two weeks, so not bad.  They provided me with all the paperwork I needed to register the car in NY and that went smoothly.

They provided the car in great condition, ready to pass inspection. Fluids were good, and oil was clean. No other importer had the car I wanted in as great shape and with the look I wanted. It was a bit on the pricey side, but it was the best one I could find.

If they have the car you want, they are straight up and will get you the car without misrepresenting anything.  At least that was my experience.</Text>

<review>I bought an 1993 S14 Silvia from them. Overall the car was in pretty decent condition but I am pretty upset about some obvious problems they neglected to tell me about before purchase.

1. Driver window intermittently stops working. 2. Odometer doesn't work.
3. AC/heat makes a really loud squeeking noise for 20 seconds when you first turn it on or off.
4. All four wheels had some unsafe ghetto non hub centric 30mm wheel spacers.
5. Stereo dead.
6. Wheel well plastic rubs on driver side on right turns.
7. Horn button get stuck in steer wheel.
8. Window tint and tint adhesive halfway removed on rear window.
9. Headlights were wired very poorly. Twisted and covered in electrical tape.
10. Side skirts are all cracked up and wavy. Mounted with huge hardware screws.
11. Worst of all it has a huge oil leak. I had it checked at a shop and it's not the oil pan, it the lower front cover which is a very expensive repair.
12. Turn signal switch was broken.

I realize it's a 25 year old car and I was not expecting perfection. But when you pay $20,000 for a 25 year old Nissan you expect it not to have glaring problems that need immediate attention. I wouldn't buy a car from them unless you can look at it in person and have it inspected by your own mechanic. I definitely feel like I got screwed over. I won't do business with them again 👎🏿💩< /review><name>Lesterthe3rd III< /name>< rating>

<Review>I bought a car from these guys a few months back and I don’t really have anything bad to say about them. They were fairly easy to deal with, they made sure I knew what I was buying, and they let me come and see the car before I bought it. I’ve been driving the car around quite a bit since then and I have to say I have really fallen in love with it. Bottom line is they sell good cars. I’ve been in and around their shop and looked at their inventory. The place is clean, well kept, and I could say the same for their vehicles. Cool guys too, the owner Yaska is really nice. If I ever buy another imported car there’s a pretty good chance it will be through Top Rank.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Purchased an r32 from them a few months back. Being on the opposite side of the country, I was a bit nervous, but the car was everything I hoped and then some. Brian was great before and after the purchase, sending links to the services performed on the car, and helping source parts afterwards as well. Loving the process of dealing with them, and owning and driving my r32. Lots of people ask about the car, and I highly recommend TopRank to all of them<//text>

I bought a sliver GTR from Top Rank because I thought that they had a better reputation than other places i had tried to deal with.  I chatted with Brian and he sold me on a stock Silver one. I flew down to Cali to inspect and drive the car and found a rattle at 5k rpms.  I agreed to do the deal on the basis they would sort the noise.  I had given them my money and then they sent me a pic of my turbos and manifolds on the ground of a supposed Skyline specialist shop and the bill was going to be around 1900 bucks.  Now they told me they would split it with me.  SO they were expecting me to pay for this service I never asked them to do. I understands parts and labor were involved so I offered to give 500 more dollars or I didnt want to do the deal. They agreed to this but then later were very cold and hard to get a hold of. I was never told exactly when the vehicle was being transported as i need to line up insurance.  Fast forward to getting the car.  I had asked how badly it leaked cause it was a 30yr old Nissan.  They claimed it didn't leak water and was fine.  When the car showed up it was about a foot of water in the spare tire well.  One of the tail lights had filled with water making a fish bowl effect. This concerned me so I brought it to a body shop where we found tons of spots where water was leaking, there was serious rot/corrosion coming form the inside out, the trunk ledge was rotted out under the seal,  the seam sealer had failed on the trunk ledge and was letting water into the trunk creating some serious crispy rot, we pulled the back glass and it was all rotted under the driver side, someone had put garbage seam sealer all over the corner of the spare tire well hiding rotted through metal, in the fronts of the wheel wells in the rear there was more garbage seams sealer that was hiding rotted through metal.  SO far I have spent serious money fixing said water leaks and rust and now I have to go to another shop because the wheel wells are pretty seriously rotted. The car also came with old dry rotted tires, power steering leak, weak battery, broken rad fan shroud, retracting mirrors aren't working, speedo cable was just pushed back in and failed shortly after receiving, Nitrogen tank is spent for Attesa system so relay clicks every ten seconds as well as awd not quite working properly,  and needed a wheel alignment. The AC system was supposedly serviced but it does not blow cold air. The stock exhaust had trashed out rear box on it that rattles like crazy. The cat mating surface is not great and shows signs of exhaust leaks. Oh yeah they also stopped responding to my emails. SO thanks guys u really let down a Nissan fan.</text>
<Resp>{'time': 1557326963621, 'text': 'We offer vehicles that are over 25 years old to the US.  These are used cars, in varying conditions.  We do our best to inspect, and present cars honestly. We spend thousands of dollars on maintenance and repair (with receipts) on vehicles prior to listing them for sale.  There are however always going to be customers that can never be happy. This is one of those customers.  No matter how good the car was to start even after doing what he asked, it was never quite right.  After seeing detailed photos including the underside, he came to our dealership on a Saturday and spent five hours inspecting this car including on a lift.  During that inspection, while on the two separate test drives we could hear the vehicle was making an unusual noise. As part of the deal, we had already given him a substantial discount on the car but we told him we would investigate the noise and correct it but due to that discount he would need to split the cost of that repair if it was over a certain amount. During an investigation, the gasket to the rear turbo was found to be leaking. The only way to fix the gasket is to remove both turbos, which is a big job on an RB26.  We had the issued fixed by a third party shop as we said we would however the customer refused to split the cost as agreed. In addition to honoring the the discount we absorbed almost the entire cost of that repair and shipped him the car.\n\nWe have responded to every single one this customers emails, and calls. We feel that we did a good job of keeping him informed of the car. The customer did not want to spend addition money to ship the car enclosed so it was sent on the next available open transport. Since the beginning of the purchase process this customer has been looking for ways to get money off the price of the car and was not willing to pay his share of the repairs that he requested. It is our conclusion that this is another attempt to fraudulently intimidate us into financially compensating  him 4 months after he personally inspected, purchased and took delivery of the vehicle.  It should also be noted that prior to the inspection done by the customer,  the customer stated that he had various other older Nissan project cars and knew what to look for.'}<//Resp><user>111407816416604524929<//user><rate>1<//rate></record>

Communication was poor. I was an obvious serious buyer (ended up buying a car) and it would take sometimes a couple days, multiple calls/ emails to get ahold of someone. Time management was also poor. I get that things don’t always go as planned but due to poor communication, I was left wondering if I’m getting ripped off at times, until they were able to respond. Overall the car was, I’d say, 75% as described. No major issues, but a few issues that were not brought to my attention prior to purchase. Tried to address the issues with them post purchase by sending them videos and pictures of said issues. As of right now, I was told it wasn’t like that before it was shipped and that they would look into a few things. Which was said 2 weeks ago and I haven’t heard a thing since. On their site they encourage you to come look at it/ test drive before you buy. I would highly recommend this.</review>

We came here to buy a car. Unfortunately, they found something wrong with it at the last minute and we were unable to get the car. They worked extremely hard to fix the car but were not successful. They will not settle for selling anything less than perfection. As a customer, I am grateful for their honestly and quality assurance standards. They were extremely kind to us and went out of try to make things work. While we are sad we were unable to get this car, it was through no fault of Toprank and are happy to return in the future to buy from this business. They truly are good people that want to sell only the best quality vehicles.< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Bought a RX7 almost a year ago, granted I should have went through the car myself or taken to a shop to look much earlier. As problems arose I took things a part to repair or inspect. But I have not put more than 100 miles on it since purchase and things that I feel should have been addressed with their “inspection” were:
-Battery was not secured nor had a bracket to secure
-Battery was no good, had to replace
-Seized radiator fan
-No crush bar behind front bumper, just has a very poorly welded piece of rusty flat stock that you can buy at any hardware store (aka front end collision will cause me to eat the engine)
-they said the fluids were changed but my oil smelled of gasoline and my antifreeze had oil in it, which if they were changed prior to purchase, then I have a very worn out engine and if not they must have been overlooked
- I was told it blew cold air which it in fact does not
- the directional control for air does not work

And and a few other cosmetic issues which are not a big deal and have been taken care of by myself. I never expected to buy a perfect car but none of these were brought to my attention prior to purchase and I was assured it had under gone a thourough inspection. Communication was somewhat slow sometimes waiting 3-5 days for simple questions. Not all was bad, they did pay for an allignment due to shipping misalligning it and I had a door closing issue which was not their fault, but they paid for the new part I needed. I strongly encourage you to look at the car in person, search on forums to see what you need to look for if you’re unfamiliar with the details of the car. Even if you have to fly out and look at it, it may save you thousands in the long run as it looks like I may be spending to get my car in running shape. Not saying all the cars they sell are like this, I’m sure they have some very nice cars, maybe I just got unlucky.< /text><date>1544085867034</date><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

<text>I purchased a GTR from International vehicle importers in January. I flew out to California and personally inspected and test drove the car, everything went smoothly with the purchase. I had the car shipped to New Mexico without any issues. Brian, Sean and Yaska were really hopeful with all the information to register the car. They have a large selection of cars and Sean is really knowledgeable with these cars. The car I purchased was extremely clean for a 26 year old car. I looked at other importers around the US and they had the cleanest cars and best reputation. I would recommend them to anyone in the market for Rhd vehicle. They always prefer the person to go and personally inspect the car before purchasing. Call and talk to Brian if you have any questions he was really hopeful with my purchase.</text>< pics>

Personally used Top Rank IVI to import my 90 R32 GTR in 2016 and then my 91 R32 GTS-t Sedan in 2017. Hands down flawless experience both times, both cars were in better condition than I ever could have imagined, and couldnt have been happier. Without a doubt, I’d recommend anyone and everyone to Top Rank, and I look forward to obtaining more cars in the future with their help!< /Text>

< Review>
Just purchased a new dishwasher from McNally's in Yuba City and it was installed last week.   Very helpful salesman when we went to the store and the delivery people were friendly, polite and did an excellent job.   Price was comparable to big box stores.   We've purchased a number of appliances from them in the past and have always been very pleased with their knowledge of the products and helpfulness in steering us to a good decision on what to purchase.<//Review>

Fair prices and great repair team. Always buy my appliances from them, even after I price the other stores in the area. For a small appliance store they are very competitive.</review>

< review>
Needed dryer part. Called em up was quoted $50 but said could probably do it for $40. Found the part needed online for $26 plus $7 shipping( they didnt know that)Got to the store and was charged $35! Super friendly on  phone and in person! Turns out didnt even need the part but was a pleasure dealing with McNally's!</review>

< Review>
Horrible customer service experience coming to this location 4/3/21 9:40PM .

The person helping us “ Nalia” was very rude . This was our first time coming to this location from Marina, and will NOT come back. Nalia was taking our order and disappeared after we had already ordered, and came back asking us if we had decided what we were going to order. Did not want to take the time explain items on the menu. Asked to speak to the manager “ Juan” and apparently was not available.

TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. UNLESS YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE BAD  CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE.</Review>

This is the 2nd Michoacana Plus that I visit and it is so good! There are options for everyone and every taste bud. There was a line but it moved at a decent pace. I've tried mostly everything so it's pretty good.<//text>

So many choices of popsicles and ice cream flavors that I could never imagine. The only thing I would like to see is the prices of the items before ordering.

(Translated by Google) I ordered home delivery, apart from the bad service they gave to the person who had to pick it up (GRUBHUB) when I opened my order I realized that the pork rind I had ordered was curious (old) and the cueritos were too HARD since I don't know They could eat ... I expected more from this paleteria since they have a lot of people every day, but very bad service. I do not recommend it !!

Ordene servicio a domicilio, aparte del mal servicio que le dieron ala persona que lo tenía que recojer (GRUBHUB) cuando abrí mi pedido me doy cuenta que el chicharron que había pedido estaba currioso (viejo ) y los cueritos estaban demasiado DUROS ya que no se podían comer ... Esperaba más de esta paleteria ya que tienen bastante gente diaramente, pero muy mal servicio.  No lo recomiendo !!<//text>

Really like to take my son here. It's right by the police station so there's no drugs going on or drinking. When you take your kid to the skatepark you would hope that there would be some respect for the children but typically there's not. This skate park is clean, pretty big, and the people who go there are consistently there. It's a very friendly family atmosphere.</Text>

Not many people nowadays especially at noon or so, its so distanced usually that a mask isn't very needed at this point unless you are at high risk. Anyways it's always a great time, lots of transfer opportunities and 4 bowls makes this place real diverse for all types of skating.<//Text>

We call it the meat shredder you eat it once your sking is gone. But don't worry if your kid has all the protective pads he or she will be fine. Extra benefit the fire dept is right there.< /text>

<Text>One of the best skateparks for little ones in San Diego county. Everything is small enough that my toddlers can get around, yet features are diverse enough that my older kids have fun too.

<Review>Skateboarding at night is a little bit harder at this park perhaps than in the daytime. Their is a lot of ledges that are hella waxed. And the hand rail has a huge crack in the role up. But it's an 8 footer. Their is a hella sweet 3 stair ledge with metal edging that grinds fast also. And a lot of down hubbas that you'll Love< /Review><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dc749d6b34551d:0x50cf0f41c9a5eda2<//gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate><userid>115075642687894598532< /userid><date>1609276585867<//date></record>

All around solid skate park. Ramps, bowls, stairs, and rails. Great place to skate if you're close by. Alga Norte skatepark is relatively close by too.<//Text>

<review>Great skatepark for all levels but mostly a beginner park. Lots of kinks and rough cement. Their are picnic benches, grass area, and fairly clean public bathrooms. Only negative besides the constant gnats flying around your head is it is overdue for a makeover.<//review>< response>

Tight trans, cheap build, no coping on any curves, not worth driving to.
Only plus is it's very quiet.</text>

Chill little spot to roll around, don't expect anything big to skate. The transitions are not curved, they're straight. Old park...old construction, the ground is very rough and if you fall onto your skin, you will get road rash. So, wear long sleeves and pants to protect you, this concrete isn't the kind that slides. The park does have lights and is open later. It's located right next to the fire station atop a hill.< /text>

<Review>Good multilevel park that can accommodate all different levels. There's picnic benches and good trees that will yield shade in the summer. The only problem is that there are quite a few gnats and flies.<//Review><user_name>Candice Peters< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

<text>Mellow park w groovy lines.  Great for beginners and posers alike.  Large all well maintained pools, bowls, grinds, twists and even one Jamaican Hand Howard.  Very cool place to bring your kids and grandkids.  Very safe environment. Right next to fire  and police stations. Well lit at night too.  3 clean shady picnic tables. Restrooms. Wheelchair accessible.  High on the top of a nice overlook.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Super mellow, almost unskateable trannys everywhere. A stair set with a massive concrete curb in front of it (no approach) all of the banks have coping?! ,most of the banks and trannys are so similar you can't tell which is which.< /Review></record>

<Text>This park has really bad abrupt transitions with coping that is barely worth calling coping. Very oddly set up. It was a great idea but executed poorly by someone that must not have known much about skating.  Go check out Alga Norte park down the street...< /Text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) I like my children too but never leave their children alone if they are kids because there are certain times that they see more young adults and you never know who they are, which is what I think respecting all blessings.

Joey and his team were recommended to us by our venue Wayfarers chapel, as well as independently recommended by our wedding planner so we knew we would be in good hands. Joey and his team were excellent to work with. They take pride in their work and it shows by their attention to detail and their clear desire to give the couple an excellent product. Joey’s humor had us laughing throughout our wedding day, so our photos came out with genuine smiles. And now we’ve got beautiful photos we will treasure for a lifetime. Thank you Joey!!<//text>

<text>The whole process was made easy by Joey Ikemoto Photography! He and his team met with us to walk through a  "day of" schedule, our engagement shoot, and even how to put together the album after our wedding day. The whole team was kind, compassionate, and patient with our numerous questions and ever-changing plans due to the pandemic. They were always, punctual, professional, and had wonderful recommendations regarding photo locations, poses, and provided us with many different photos to commemorate our special day. Thanks to Joey's suggestion, we ended up taking our couples' portraits at a gorgeous ocean bluff nearby and now have the most amazing photos to remember our wedding by. We are happy to have found this team and will be using them in the future whenever we need photographers to capture special moments.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Joey and his team are not only gifted photographers, but also great time managers.  Our venue was beautiful, but extremely remote, which created several delays. With Joey’s direction, all the items on our agenda were completed seamlessly.  He captured the sentiments of the occasion with beauty and elegance.  The images he captured will live in our minds and hearts, reminding us that love can be shared even with a pandemic raging around us.  With much love and gratitude, Frank Sciotto and Mayra Harris.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dd4ab0b74bfbd7:0xee1cef4317385cab</GmapID></record>

My husband and I both knew how important it is to have stunning photography to capture a wedding. Therefore, we chose the talented Joey Ikemoto to photograph our wedding & reception because his photos are AMAZING! Joey was extremely flexible in working with us through COVID restrictions. Plus, he was extremely professional, personable, and kept the jokes flowing which put everyone at ease in front of the camera. You can’t go wrong with Joey and his team. We are beyond happy!</review>

<Review>Joey, Sam, Kevin, and Tracy are amazing and wonderful to work with!  Sam and Kevin photographed my wedding, but Joey, who is the owner of the studio, was directly involved every step of the way. Tracy heads up the office and made the whole process – booking, contacts, billing, etc.- easy and seamless from start to finish.

We’d initially planned a big wedding with a formal ceremony and reception, but had to change the date and then to a small private ceremony and no reception due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Joey and his team were especially accommodating with all the changes we had to make.

At our wedding Sam and Kevin made sure to get all the photos of the ceremony, the family/friends photos, and fun photos, but they also took some beautiful art photos that look like they belong in magazines!  Looking at my wedding photos now, their work exceeded all my expectations!  My husband and I will cherish these photos always.

Please know that the few words written here really don’t do justice to what’s it’s like to work with this photography studio. They really are terrific and they really know what they are doing. For anyone reading this who is looking for a great (not good, but great) photographer, you can't go wrong with Joey Ikemoto Photography. I can't recommend Joey and his team enough! I am so lucky to have booked them for my wedding!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>This is one of the most important celebrated days of your life and you want to make sure you have the right person who will capture that special moment to ensure your beautiful memories will be saved and shared over the years. That is why you choose Joey Ikemoto Photography. They have been around for over 25 years and the staff is friendly, professional, and dependable. They make it really easy to relax and have fun on your special day.

Our photographer was Sam. He was brilliant. He makes it easy for those who are not the photogenic person, like me. He captures the moment and then adds his own flare. Overall, I was thrilled to see our pictures came out beautiful. I am happy to share this review with all of those searching for the right photographers, it is one of the most important pieces of your wedding. I would definitely recommend using this group to capture your memories.

Thank you, Joey and Sam, for your brilliant work. My wife and I are grateful for your talented work and your professionalism.<//text>< GmapID>

Simply put, Joey, Tracy, and the whole team are amazing.  My wife and I could not be happier with the results of Joey's photographs from our recent wedding at Wayfarer's Chapel.  With our whole engagement/wedding occurring during Covid, Joey and Tracy could not have been more awesome and accommodating.  Not only are they personable and friendly, but their work is top notch.  They are always available, respond promptly to e-mails and phone calls, and the end product speaks for itself.

As for our wedding day, Joey is hilarious and had everyone comfortable and smiling in front of the camera, which shows in the photographs.  We cannot wait to get our photo album and framed photos, and we will cherish the work Joey did for the rest of our lives.  I cannot recommend Joey and his team more highly!

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Getting married can be very stressful given all of the planning, including choosing the right photographer for our wedding. They're were too many to choose from. We just wanted someone whose well known for their work. While we were at a meeting at our wedding planners office there were many pictures on display of prior wedding ceremonies and a few particular pictures stood out and caught my wife's eye. She wanted to know who took the photos and our wedding planner mentioned Joey from Joey Ikemoto Photography, and that he had come highly recommended by many. She also mentioned that he frequents taking wedding pictures at Wayfarers so hes familiar with the landscape and knows all the ideal places to take great pictures. My wife and I knew right then we had to have him shoot our wedding. We hired him and had no regrets. During the times we interacted with Joey he was funny, well organized, and very professional. We definitely would like to thank Joey and his son for the wonderful pictures they took of our wedding. They came out perfect. We couldn't have asked for more. Thank you for making our special day memorable with your presence and the gorgeous pictures you took on our wedding.</review>< Pics>

I want to personally think Joey for his excellent work.  Selecting Wayfarers Chapel for a dusk wedding poses photographic challenges that require unique know-how.  Having reviewed several photographer portfolios, Joey Ikemoto’s work stood out, especially regarding his artistic proficiency in low light settings.  …not to mention his familiarity with every facet and nuance at Wayfarers facility.
Joey’s team was kind, proficient, patient and helpful.  You don’t get a “do-over” when it comes to capturing a special event like a wedding.  I’m glad I chose Joey Ikemoto Photography… you will be too!

<Review>Joey Ikemoto came highly recommended for our daughter’s wedding by the reception hotel, and his online portfolio photos confirmed the excellence of his studio.  But we were most impressed when we met with Joey in person, and found him to be warm, down to earth, and blessed with a great sense of humor.  Throughout the months leading up to the wedding, he was very helpful - his timeline suggestions made it easy to plan the wedding day events - and he and his staff, especially Tracy, were always responsive to questions and concerns.  When COVID restrictions resulted in churches being closed, our daughter had no choice but to postpone her wedding.  Joey put us at ease, and worked with us patiently through all of the constantly changing restrictions, including the need to move both the church ceremony and reception outdoors.  Meanwhile, Joey worked with our daughter and son-in-law to put together an engagement photo session, and the resulting photos are just gorgeous.  We were impressed with Joey’s artistry, and his ability to capture the couple at their best.  It was difficult to choose our favorite photos from the gallery - they were all so beautiful.  On the day of the wedding, Sam was our photographer.  He was amazing.  Throughout the entire day, he and his assistant Jeremy were constantly active, yet not intrusive.  They even helped with putting on corsages and boutonnières! They were masters at getting candid shots without the subjects being self-conscious.  They made sure to capture the moments that were most important to us, and did it with beauty and artistry.  They were very creative in making the best use of the locations. The resulting photos are stunning!  They were also fun to be around, and we received compliments from the wedding party, family, and guests.  We are grateful to Joey, Sam, Jeremy, and Tracy for going above and beyond in capturing our daughter’s wedding under difficult conditions.</Review>< Pictures>

Joey and his team were amazing!! We met up with him before the wedding to go through the entire wedding timeline, what were important shots we needed to get and any important moments they should not miss. On the day of, we stuck to that schedule and he also helped out for a lot of little moments, such as bustling my dress!! The final photos were wonderful, and captured all the moments we talked about and more. We can’t wait to design our album and we highly recommend Joey Ikemoto Photography!< /Text>

He was so funny and easy to work with. Sam and Jonathan photographed our wedding and they were so much fun   to work with. They captured such stunning photos and we couldn't be happier that we chose them. Big bonus they were amazing with my 11month old son and came so prepared with capturing his attention for photos. All our guests were complimenting how wonderful these photographers were all day. Truly professionals, highly recommend!< /text>< Date>

We had the honor of working with Joey and his team for our wedding in September! Meeting with Joey ahead of time to iron out the details for our wedding day really helped. We had the privilege to do our engagement shoot with Joey. My wife and I aren't used to taking formal pictures, but Joey has such a great sense of humor that really made it easy for us to pose in front of the camera. We chose Sam to shoot our wedding day. It seemed like he had a set plan for every location we shot at, and like Joey, he made it extremely easy for use to take photos, and we really enjoyed shooting for the entire day. My wife and I feel like pros now when we pose in front of the camera!< /text>

I am so glad that I selected Joey Ikemoto as my photographer! While I was having a Planning Meeting at Wayfarer’s Chapel, Joey was highly recommended, and I can see why!   Once I was shown some photos of his work, I knew I had to ask him to capture my special day.  He met with us to do our engagement shoot and help us plan a timeline for our special day. We got married at Wayfarers Chapel and had our reception at Le Foyer in North Hollywood. Joey knows the chapel so well, that he created a very specific timeline that worked perfectly on our wedding day (photos of us getting ready, at the ceremony site, photos of us at the park and beach, and reception)! Joey was so organized, and kept me laughing the whole day. He even got a smile out of my husband (which is rare, so I’m glad he photographed it)! All of the photographs came out beautifully.  I highly recommend Joey Ikemoto Photography.</Text>

<review>My family has been using Joey’s photography services for generations (moms, aunties, and brother all hired Joey as their wedding photographer), and all of us recommend him to our friends/family who are getting married or are in need of a nice family portrait. He has done thousands of weddings and knows the flow and timeline of a wedding by heart, and helped give us an outline for our wedding during our planning session. He also put in a fun game during the wedding so that my husband and I could get all of our table photos in time (all table photos to be done in two songs), and our guests told us later that they thought it was a great idea! Joey knew how to make my husband and I feel (more) comfortable when we were displaying PDA in front of a camera, and he knew the poses that would make us look the best. We will cherish the photos from our wedding for a long time.</review><gmap_id>0x80dd4ab0b74bfbd7:0xee1cef4317385cab</gmap_id><username>Lauren Fast<//username><user>114827255802233928166< /user></record>

<Review>I am so so happy I chose to go with this company. The whole experience was amazing. From setting up appointments, engagement photos, to the day of wedding I am pleased with all of it. They really help take off some of the stress of planning a wedding, especially a destination wedding.  Joey took our engagement photos and made my husband who was grumpy laugh the whole time. Tracy set up all my appointment , went through the planning with me and made great suggestions of where to get the best shots, all which turned out amazing despite powerful wind. Henry was awesome! On the day of her was punctual, kind and calming presence. His eye is great and the shots came out amazing. They are so good I cried when I went through them. He got great shots despite fighting the wind. I can't say enough good things, they know what they are doing and are worth every penny.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Joey Ikemoto was the best photographer we could have asked for! He met with us about five months before our wedding to do our engagement shoot and help us plan our day. We got married at Wayfarers Chapel and had our reception at the Hyatt Regency in Long Beach, and because Joey knows the area (particularly the chapel) so well he helped us create a timeline of 15 minute increments that worked perfectly on our wedding day! Joey was our photographer, and his son Jonathan was his assistant. They were both so organized and personable, and Joey kept us laughing the whole day. The pictures turned out beautifully, and now we have the difficult task of figuring out which beautiful pictures to choose! I highly, highly recommend Joey Ikemoto Photography, especially if you're getting married at Wayfarers Chapel.< /Review>< Rating>

As a wedding planner, I work with a LOT of photographers and Joey had some ideas that I haven't ever seen in my 12+ years in the business. We were able to do table photos in just 6 minutes (something that usually takes upwards of an hour!) I appreciate his creativity and calm demeanor the day of the wedding 😊< /Review>< Resp>

Joey was amazing! The day of our wedding, he was so organized and able to direct everyone efficiently. The images came out incredible and it was more than we could have ever asked for. His entire staff is a pleasure and easy to work with and made the entire process stress-free! Will definitely use Joey and staff again for any professional photo needs.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>We used Joey Ikemoto for our wedding in July in San Juan Capistrano. Sam was our photographer and I can not say enough good things about him and his assistant! They were beyond wonderful. Our pictures were great! There are a lot of little quirky things that me and my husband do as "inside jokes" and Sam made sure to pay attention and capture these moments. I married into a BIG fat Greek family and my own family traveled all the way from Georgia for this special day and you can FEEL the love in the pictures! They are breathtaking, really.

We truly loved these guys so much, my husband and I even have a picture with them!! They were professional, fun and made the experience amazing. PLUS!!! We now have thousands of pictures to cherish (and sort through, lol) for the rest of our lives!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Sam and Jonathan photographed my wedding at the Turnip Rose Promenade. I had seen photos from their previous work at that same venue and was happy with it. Decided to book them immediately. Looking at my wedding photos now, their work has exceeded my expectations. Every detail of the wedding was captured and the timeline went by so smoothly. They knew where to go and what to do. Sam went above and beyond. He even helped me bustle my dress!

They are true professionals and I am so lucky to have booked them for my wedding. I'll cherish the photos forever.<//review>

<text>Joey Ikemoto Photography captured moments throughout our wedding that we will be able to cherish for years to come. His creative and fun nature allowed for unique one of a kind photos. My husband and I knew we were in good hands after our first meeting with him and his staff. They walked us through their different packages and were very responsive to emails. Joey also provided us with a "wedding day" timeline which was extremely helpful and greatly appreciated. We are so glad we chose Joey Ikemoto Photography and hope to work with him again in the future.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dd4ab0b74bfbd7:0xee1cef4317385cab</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I wish there was a rating higher than 5 stars because Joey and his team deserve more than just the best review. They were so incredibly professional and entertaining, qualities that you can rarely find in conjunction. Not only were they prepared for every possible situation, they worked with speed and smiles the entire time despite dehydration and sunburns. I am the first of my family to get married and the first of many of my friends and they all were absolutely start struck with Joey and his team, as well as the photos they produced. The quality in character and content that this team delivers is unmatchable. If I were to do it all again, I would make sure that booking Joey was my top priority!</review>< user_name>

My husband, family, and friends loved him and how passionate he is about his work. He is absolutely hands-down the best photographer I have ever dealt with! He works so well with people and was especially kind with my husband and I. He knows just the right angles and just the right positioning in his photography as well as perfect timing of the right light needed in photos. It was nothing but a positive experience with Joey and I highly recommend you to use him for your photos as well!

I was honestly thrilled with the work Joey Ikemoto did at my wedding. My husband and I were married at Wayfarers Chapel and Joey took some of the loveliest wedding photos I have ever seen. I have received so many compliments from friends and family regarding Joey’s work. He has a definite knack for putting everyone at ease on the big day and his artistic choices are spot on. Joey and his staff are punctual and extremely professional. We could not be more pleased and I would strongly recommend him to anyone looking for fabulous wedding photos!< /Text>

Joey's team was really professional, creative, accommodative and funny at the same time. They were super familiar with great photo spots and times of the day in Point Vicente to achieve the highest quality pictures.
We highly recommend Joey's team to couples who are looking for recording their special day in a special way.<//text>

The team at Joey Ikemoto is extremely professional and friendly. Sam was a pleasure to have as a photographer, and many guests complimented on his cheerful attitude and efficient behavior. With his knowledge and experience at Wayfarer Chapel, poses, and lightening, I’m confident that the pictures will be something we will enjoy for our lifetime together. We highly recommend Sam, and Joey’s full team, and their expertise for your special day to remind you of your forever love.<//Text>

Joey was the photographer for our wedding and we could not be more pleased with the pictures. The pictures were so beautiful, everyone who saw it said it came out great! Some said it looked like a movie shoot! The quality and the pictures were so professionally done! We highly recommend anyone getting married or need a photographer to use Joey. He is a professional and knows what he is doing. Highly recommend!</Review>

What can I say about Joey Ikemoto Photography other than they delivered everything we wanted, made my wife extremely happy and helped make the most of our special day!

First and foremost, my wife was sold once she saw a number of images off the Joey Ikemoto site so we made an appointment to meet with them and weren't disappointed! The solid and reassuring sense of a professional studio (they are!), the helpful tips and thoughtfulness to help us get the most out of them AND our 'day',  and the openness of being available to work with us and address all our concerns sealed the deal.

With all the anxieties that go along with the months of planning a wedding, Joey Ikemoto Photography made us feel secure with our choice and grateful for offering info on so many things we wouldn't have otherwise considered.

Finally, when the day came and all the plans came to be, things started just as we had hoped.  We were so happy to work directly with Joey for our wedding, and when he showed up he did nothing but satisfy!  He was punctual and brought a reassuring sense along with him.

We had met with him before, but there is something about his studio that is personal, playful, and fun - he really calmed a lot of tension with his personality and joking, and could really draw out the best of his subjects in his photos.  He made it feel easy, but still important at the same time.

He kept the day moving, commanding everything we were hoping for, making sure it all "got done", and got done perfectly!

Without gushing on I can only say that I could not recommend Joey Ikemoto Photography any more, you will love working with his studio, you will love working with Tracy, you will love his ability to help guide you through your day, and you will LOVE your photos!!< /review>

<review>Honestly, I could not have asked for more. From the Engagement photos session, to the getting ready, to the ceremony and reception: totally and completed thrilled with Joey and his assistants. They took the time to make sure I was comfortable, helped keep my two kids in check and even had a bridal emergency kit that came in super handy! I absolutely love my pictures. They even got my two year old son to smile in almost all the pictures. Super impressed! <3<//review>< pictures>

Joey recently photographed our wedding at Wayfarers.  We selected him because they had recommended him.  That was a fantastic decision.  He know the grounds and all the best angles.  He was able to get a huge number of different photos in the 2 hours that we were there.  He was especially good at getting the attention of the children.  He planned the whole time out in 15 minute increments,  which really made everything go very smoothly.  I would absolutely recommend Joey.< /review>

Joey is an established name (probably THE established name) for wedding photos in Southern California. We picked him after having friends use him in the past at their weddings. On the day, Sam was our photographer and he was fantastic - very attentive and him and his assistant Jeremy were great about making sure all groups were organized for photos.

Before the wedding, we had an engagement shoot with Joey, where he helped lay out the schedule for the day. It's hard to balance the desire to get more photos with the desire to not feel rushed during the day, and we ended up cutting an extra photo location in the schedule. Tracy and the rest of the office staff were always very responsive to our questions and messages.

Prices are what you might expect, which is to say, very high. I wish engagement photos were included, not just the session. Overall, happy with how the day went and how attentive Sam and Jeremy were.< /review>

WORTH EVERY PENNY!

I am so glad we did not skimp when it came to selecting the right photographer for our wedding day!

Joey and his team were very professional and personable in how they interacted with our friends and family during picture-taking. The customer service we received was fantastic; always responding to our calls and emails in a very prompt manner. Pictures last a lifetime and we are so happy with the quality of work Joey, Henry, and the rest of their staff were able to produce. Our pictures are breathtaking.

True artists; true professionals! Thank you to the entire staff who served us throughout our wedding journey. We will cherish it forever!<//Text>

Sam and Nate photographed our wedding at Wayfarer’s chapel and reception at Catalina Kitchen at Terranea. All our photographers were very familiar with our venues and helped us to navigate the strict time limitations and photography rules that those venues imposed. In addition to being knowledgeable, organized, and professional, the photographers were all very personable and coaxed great photos out of me despite the jitters. Tracy was very helpful and communicative with the administrative side of things. Highly recommended!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The day of our wedding Sam one of the photographers from his team took our pictures for our special day and all of them came out beautiful. We will definitely recommend him and we will be going to him for our family pictures from now on.</Text>< Rating>

Joey and his team were INCREDIBLE. They captured such incredible moments in both the ceremony and reception that would've otherwise been lost in the chaos. He made sure everyone was comfortable, no stuffy poses. The session afterwards was fun- and the finished products were absolutely gorgeous. Highly, highly recommend.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>WOW! Joey Ikemoto captured the most incredible sunset pictures at our beach wedding, combined with a broad range of photos throughout the day – from smiling to dramatic to candid and fun! Joey Ikemoto offers a rare mix of technical ability and outstanding people skills. He worked with the family to bring out the best in them (and us) like a true professional. A few weeks after the wedding, we were provided with a selection of some of the best shots that were colour corrected to really make them pop – along with the full catalogue of over 1,300 shots – the majority of which were excellent with a few being truly outstanding! Thanks Joey Ikemoto and the team for giving us memories that we can look back on and cherish for years to come.</review>< pictures>

Being 80 and 70 years old, we wanted someone who could capture the specialness of two people finding each other so late in life. Our wedding was very small, with just our children, grandchildren and a great-granddaughter (18 people) in attendance. Joey has a way of engaging everyone, and his photos reflect that. They are pure magic. Words can't convey the beauty, originality and very personal quality of our photos. We couldn't be happier, and are so grateful to him for giving us a way to recapture our amazing day over and over again. What a beautiful way for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren to be able to "know" us in the decades ahead, when we will be watching down on our beautiful families!< /text>< Pics>

I didn't have to think at all...the photographers just told me what to do and when to do it.  After the wedding, our photos came out just gorgeous, and we had so many options for albums, prints, etc.  Overall an excellent experience!<//Review>< Pics>

Going up to the wedding date, I was finishing up school and frantically planning the wedding with my husband and family. I was in a whirlwind of worry about how the wedding was going to go. On the day of the wedding, Joey was one of the first vendors to arrive (plenty early before the wedding), and his humor and presence calmed my worry dramatically. Joey was super calm, collected and respectful to all of the guests (even the difficult ones). To all prospective clients, I highly recommend the group photos following the ceremony, as they were a huge hit with the guests and friends. I have no regrets with going with Joey and his team as they were one of the most professional vendors I have had!<//Text>

I am so glad we went with Joey Ikemoto Photography.  My friend used them for her wedding two years ago and her photos turned out great so we decided to use them as well.  Joey did our engagement photos and Henry did our wedding and the pictures turned out so wonderful.  They were really great and posing us to get the perfect pictures.  I would highly recommend this company.</Review>

<text>Joey Ikemoto and his associates are AWESOME! We loved how they captured all the different components of our wedding (ceremony, receptions and pre/post wedding family pictures). The blog photos are spectacular and we can’t wait to see the rest of them. He also did an amazing job on our engagement shoot and he definitely delivered with the ideas we were going for with the nature theme. The wedding photos also had a ton of great ideas that he and his team came up with. He also prepared in advance an itinerary in case it rains, which definitely came in handy. Joey, Henry plus Joey’s son are great and made everyone feel comfortable and their photos came out beautiful! Joey was really good with our flower girl and ring bearer; he also made the adults laugh with his bubbles and funny impressions. Fun, lively and gorgeous photos, we are grateful to have Joey Ikemoto and associates do our engagement and wedding photos!! ^_^< /text>< userid>

<text>We found Joey Ikemoto via Instagram after seeing some photos of weddings in the South Bay, and glad we went with them for our wedding at the PVIC. They even threw in an engagement shoot so we could have pictures for our Save the Date and Invitations. Our photos were amazing! They captured all the moments we wanted (before and during) and made the process enjoyable. The photographers were punctual, professional, had good senses of humor, and were talented. Did I mention our photos were amazing? haha. In addition, administratively, Joey Ikemoto is great to work with. Responses to emails are quick, and we were always given excellent customer service. Everything was easy. We highly recommend Joey Ikemoto for your photography needs.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Christina Poa-Li< /Name><Review>I would highly recommend Joey and his team. We had our wedding at Los Verdes Golf Course but I was in New York for school while we were planning. I felt comfortable with this studio because they have extensive experience with the venue, but also because they are just true professionals. They were extremely organized, responsive to all my questions, and flexible with planning meetings. We planned a timeline months in advance, and the day of the wedding went MORE smoothly than I even hoped it would. The best part: the photos.  INCREDIBLE. We just saw our preview photos and they're the perfect mix of candid, romantic, and epic. Ask for Sam as your photographer and you'll thank yourself later.< /Review>< rating>

Joey and his team are absolutely amazing and went above and beyond for our wedding!  My reception venue cancelled at the last minute and Joey called me with a list of other venues to try to save our day.  I did not expect that at all and it was so kind of him to show that much concern!   Our photographers on our wedding had great personalities and knew exactly how to interact with everyone to get the perfect shots.  Their service and attention to detail had many of my guests wanting to know the name of our photographer before the event was over and they hadn’t even seen any of the photos yet!  The images they captured are absolutely stunning and I cannot wait to have them take photos for our family in the future.  If Joey Ikemoto is not your photographer yet, book him now!  You will not regret it!</Text>

<review>Joey Ikemoto is an amazing photographer and did a fabulous job of capturing our beach wedding on camera. We were blessed with a beautiful sunset and Joey got some great silhouette shots of us at the water’s edge at Redondo Beach. He also brought out the best in all the family with his personable manner and upbeat vibe. A true professional, highly recommended.<//review>< time>

When planning our wedding, the one thing that was so often said was: don't skimp on the photographer. Well, of course we knew we wanted to get the best that we could afford, and in looking at The Knot and after a recommendation from Wayfarer's Chapel (our venue), we decided to look at Joey's site; we were blown away And decided on Joey Ikemoto.
What a terrific choice! Our photographer Sam was so sweet and patient and worked with our schedule and was so clever in how and where to take pictures of our special day. Now that our pics are ready, our family and friends can not stop saying how beautiful the shots are. I'm so so glad we chose to go with Joey.< /Review>

My husband and I hired Joey and his team for our wedding and we were not disappointed. Joey sat down with us and gave us a run down of the schedule for the day of the wedding and listed out places where we could take pictures; previous photographers I had hired had never done this. The schedule for the day of the wedding turned out exactly how we planned; no flaws.

Henry was our photographer for the day of the event. He was very professional, on time, courteous and has amazing talent. The photos are beautiful, professionally taken and artistic.
I highly recommend Joey and his team - they are talented and professional but they also care very much about the customer. I value that because other vendors we hired disappeared after the event and didn't bother to give a courtesy call afterwards.< /Text>

Joey and his assistant were amazing for our wedding day! They were recommended to us by our venue (Los Verdes Golf Course) and we could not have been happier. Joey made everyone feel comfortable while taking photos and would joke with us to get true smiles and reactions - he is hilarious! Due to my make-up and hair teams running late, our schedule had to change a little and Joey was very accommodating and still got the main photos that we wanted. I would absolutely recommend him and his studio, and would definitely hire them again.< /review>

We had an amazing experience with Joey and the rest of the staff.  We planned our wedding in the Los Angeles area from Texas and the communication from the studio was exceptional. All email were quickly responded to (usually within an hour) and phone calls were always answered during business hours. All questions were answered thoroughly and we got no pressure to up sell to a more expensive package.
The week before our wedding Joey called us to go over timeline, specific instructions we had, ensure he knew specific photos we wanted, and answer any last minute questions.

The day of the wedding they arrived on time and jumped right into taking photos. Joey was not only great at his job but acted as a day of stress reliever and kept us all laughing. I am the last of 4 boys to get married and everyone commented the Joey was by far the best photographer they have every seen. The photos all came out better then we could have expected! Cant wait to get the album in! I would recommend Joey to anyone who has any sort of photography needs.<//review>

<review>We could not be happier with Joey Ikemoto’s photography. Joey and his team made the entire process smooth and enjoyable. Their years of experience really shine through everything from the photos themselves to how they interacted with our guests and the wedding party.

When my now wife first discovered and suggested Joey Ikemoto Photography, I was very hesitant. After sitting down and speaking with Joey and meeting some of his team all my hesitation went out the window. Joey explained how everything worked, broke down a timetable, described how his equipment was a par above everyone else and really proved to us his price. After that, we were sold. When the time came, they delivered.

We had Sam and Nathan with us on our wedding day. They arrived promptly at my soon to be bride’s hotel and began their work. Taking beautiful, elegant, and creative photos of her accessories, dress, and all of the prep work while never being “in the way” of her stylist and bridesmaids. Even with the flower girls, Sam and Nathan had them laughing a giggling and when the girls got distracted they busted out bubbles the capture their attention again. Once my Bride and her girls were dressed and ready, they captured beautiful moments in and around the hotel and really utilized the uniqueness of the environment they were in. Once at the Church then the reception Sam and Nathan continued to capture beautiful pictures. Excellent candid shots all over and even the ‘posed’ photos look amazing.

They had our pictures up on their blog extremely fast and had the photo’s for us to review faster than anyone else we knows photographers did. Overall we are extremely happy with Joey Ikemoto Photography and have/will recommend them to anyone looking for a quality photographer.</review>< Pics>

Joey Ikemoto Studios was my first choice (and should be yours!) when selecting a wedding photographer for my big day in 2017. The images produced by their team are some of the most striking you will find. Our photographer, Sam (and his assistant), displayed phenomenal talent, organization and service! Levi and I SO appreciate the artistry and professionalism displayed by Joey Ikemoto Studios. Our entire nuptial experience was improved by selecting them- from prompt communication and budgeting to planning our itinerary in their cozy offices- it is easy to see why they are such awarded experts in their field. The amazing things captured forever in frame on our special day make me feel like my dream wedding was finally realized and forever immortalized. To the entire staff @ Joey Ikemoto Studios: THANK YOU and Much Love!!

AMAZING is the only word we can use to describe Joey Ikemoto Photography! Joey and his staff were an instrumental part of our day being such a success.

From the moment we sat down to discuss the schedule of events, they used their vast experience of wedding day photography to help us revise our day and make it flawless.

Sam and Austin were punctual, VERY professional, and super talented!! Once the formal photos were taken, they both melted into the background  and snapped hundreds of pictures while we partied the night away, never missing a beat.

We cannot say enough good things about the entire staff, especially Sam and Austin.  We promise you will not be disappointed!!<//Review>

We just got back our wedding photos from Joey Ikeomoto Photography and we are obsessed!!!  Sam was our photographer and he did such an awesome job.  He captured EVERY moment from getting ready to the ceremony and finally, the party!  Everything that I discussed with Sam and Joey prior to the wedding went perfectly.  I would recommend Sam and Joey to any person getting married.< /text>

<Text>My wife and I used Joey Ikemoto Photography for our wedding at the Point Vicente Interpretive Center in Palos Verdes on April 6, 2019. Some of our friends used Joey as their photographer a few years earlier and the photos were great so we felt good about moving forward without shopping around.

We met with Joey one month before the wedding and he helped establish a timeline for our wedding day. The meeting was very fun and Joey is great to work with. He helped to suggest a location for our "first look" shots as well as an area to get beach background shots.

Sam was our photographer for the wedding. We started out at a nearby hotel and then did some lovely beach shots before heading over to the venue. Sam was very friendly and professional. I personally am not one for taking a lot of photos and Sam was always good about making sure things ran efficiently and kept things moving in a positive way. He helped select my tie color that would work best for the photos and was always willing to step in and help any way he could. Thank you to Jeremy as well who assisted Sam and delivered the same friendly and professional services.

We got really lucky with the weather during our event and Sam made sure to capitalize on the ocean views and sunset. Sam was able to get several candid shots in addition the traditional more posed photos. He captured several great shots of us, our friends and family, and the venue. It was a beautiful day and a fun event, we're so happy Sam was there to document the day. The photos have turned out wonderful and we are very happy with Joey Ikemoto Photography. We would highly recommend their services.< /Text>< Date>

<Text>We had the pleasure of having Joey Ikemoto Photography (Joey himself, actually!) for our wedding photos. During the entire wedding planning and execution process, Team Ikemoto was very professional, friendly and easy to work with. We loved the final products and would (and HAVE) recommended him to anyone who has asked us for a quality wedding photographer. We're looking forward to working with Team Ikemoto again.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

< Review>
I feel as if I could write a novel-length thank you note for both Sam and Jeremy from Joey Ikemoto's team. They were an absolutely integral part of our wedding day and were like family by the end of the evening.

Several people - including a bridesmaid, my mother, and my newly minted mother-in-law - have taken professional-level photography classes (they're all actually quite good) so I had a fear that they would be stepping in to intervene and offer amateur opinions at various points. Within 30 minutes of Sam and Jeremy arriving, each of those three family members came up to me separately to say that they'd be leaving their cameras behind because both Sam and Jeremy anticipated key shots before the women in my family even had a moment to call it out. They didn't need any direction whatsoever - and they didn't miss a single thing. They were fun and creative on the fly yet showed utmost professionalism.

I haven't even seen the photos yet and I already know that they will be cherished for a lifetime based on the angles, the lighting, and the way that they posed Philip and me. We felt natural around them (well, that's a lie, they made us feel like movie stars) and have no doubt that will show in the finished product.< /Review>

So when it was time to plan our wedding, Joey came up as a preferred photographer for our venue (South Coast Botanic Garden) and I knew that we had to check him out. I love the location of his studio and that all of his staff are super friendly. Our wedding package came with an engagement photo session, which I'm glad we took advantage of because it was good practice for the big day. Joey and Ethan were our photographers the day of, and they were so fun to work with. They were able to wrangle all of our 150 guests together to get an awesome group picture and even managed to get some sweet pictures of my dog. :) I've already received some blog preview photos and am in LOVE.

Joey came to California Crosspoint Academy in the Bay Area to help us shoot promotional pictures of our new building.  He was so professional and so chill at the same time. He was always open to our thoughts and ideas and threw out so many creative ideas to present our school in a distinctive style.   He was easy to work with and wanted to really get to know us, not just as clients, but people.  All of the students and staff he photographed felt totally at ease and he got the best out of each person.  He went above and beyond the call of duty for us.  When the shoot was over he sent us the proofs so quickly and followed up to make sure we were happy with the pictures.  Skill and customer service, what more could we ask for!< /text>

We were married in September and was lucky enough to have Nate photograph our wedding.  It was a long 12hr + day all over LA.  And by all over, I mean from Torrance to LA to PV to San Gabriel Valley.  At one point, I was worried he was tired and told him to sit down, but ever dedicated to his craft, he refused and kept shooting pictures.  He was very professional and kept making sure things were moving.  He was also a fun guy to talk to.  His Cantonese skills and child behavioral skills were especially useful in herding my family members into position.  When considering the extremely long day and remarkable quality of pictures/services, the price was very reasonable.< /Review>

The photos speak for themselves!  Not only are they extremely talented photographers, but Joey and his team are extremely professional, have the best equipment, and have so much experience in the industry.  This became very obvious when we sat down with Joey and he went through our entire wedding day plan minute by minute to make sure our photographers (Sam & Jason) knew exactly what was going on and who needed to be in which shots and when.  Sam was so good at picking cool angles and coaching us on how to pose and even brought his own props to make the shots of the accessories look extra special.  I haven't received all the photos yet (it's only been 2 weeks), but our photos that made it on the blog are AMAZING!  They can make anyone look good!  Joey has the best range of package prices to work with anyone's budget.  I cannot recommend them enough.<//review>

My wedding was over nine months ago, and I feel we're in a good place to finally leave a review. We are not naive; we understand that the photos and videos Joey shares on his website and social media are a small margin compared to the entirety of the events he shoots. Our venue recommended him, and he's got an impressive studio. We were sold. A few things to look out for: When signing the contract - the prices are all tied to prints at the end, not the actual event. Please please keep an eye on this, as you will spend thousands of dollars on prints that should cost a fraction of that. Not only did we pick the top plan because we wanted to work with Joey, but we also added on the photo booth. This was $5000-6000 in total. Joey was fun to work with on the day of the wedding; I cannot stress that enough. He's a good guy and a good photographer. With that being said, the entirety of the process left a lot to be desired. A month or so after the wedding we received a link of a batch of photos that were edited, and we were pleasantly surprised. Nothing that was a once-in-a-lifetime shot, but good pictures. We were so excited to see more. And then, a link went out to our entire family with 1200 unedited photos. Weird faces, bad angles, overexposure, and they were all for sale. Every picture was a sale opportunity. We then received calls from everyone - "why is this photo of me online; it's horrible!" They were bad photos of our parent, me (groom), and my wife (bride). It was a terrible look and left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. More importantly, that link he originally sent was it; those were the good photos we were getting. We ended up with dozens of overexposed photos, blurry photos, and grainy photos from the night shots. The same shots he's done at the same venue hundreds of times. They point blank weren't great, and absolutely not for what we spent on them. We left our wedding day with about 12 photos we really love. His excuse was the sun, our light sensitivity, etc. It would have been better just to say, "it wasn't my best day." After all of this, your left with the massive credit I discussed earlier. Oh, and you don't get ANY photos unless you spend the entire credit on his 500% marked up prices. So we did that. $28 for every little 5x7 photo. $34 for the 8x10 images. These are $5-10 on most sites like Mpix for the highest of quality. We wanted to order a book for our in-laws - it was nearly $1500. It has 30 photos in it, it's called The Redwood Album, and it can be recreated for around $300 on almost every single photography print website on the planet. Period. I left another review on this page the day after our wedding, and it was glowing - he was fun to work with. But wow, everything else was a real nightmare. Be sure to ask a ton of questions up front about pricing, because there is some dangerous smoke and mirrors happening on that front. Also, don't allow a professional photographer who shoots weddings to complain about the sun's placement during a 5:30 pm wedding. I believe Joey Ikemoto is a good person and a good photographer. I also think he really dropped the ball on our wedding and was paid handsomely to do that. Our wedding was 6/2/18, and we received our final photos on 3/28/19. This was because we hadn't used up our credit for him to mark up the images and collect on. We finally just ordered anything to move on. Luckily, we're in love and remember a fantastic day, even if there were only overexposed photos of our ceremony, and not a single picture of the dance routine we spent months preparing for - no sunlight in there to blame.<//text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>I totally believe in family portraits and remembering our loved ones... and the value of that hit home even harder this past year when we lost mom....(age 92). I am SO THANKFUL for the portraits Joey took of our family.  We did it a couple different times, about 5 years apart, but they were SO great. Everyone is awkward when in front of a camera and expected to smile- and few of us can summon up a "real" smile on command... but Joey is so funny and friendly and kept us all cracking up and they were the BEST expressions on all of us! Of course the location, background and arrangement of the group was great (expected from a master photographer) but the magic of it all, and what I love, every time I see our pictures is the joy and the REAL smiles he captured. There are lots of decent photographers out there but so few that possess the true personality and genuine hilarious character it takes to get great expressions on top of that. We will be going to Joey for our family portraits for as long as we are a family!< /review><Time>1501529521978</Time><Response>None<//Response><Name>Suzette Allen< /Name></record></dataset><record>

But once we viewed the beautiful and artistic photos on the Joey Ikemoto Photography website, we stopped looking further and knew we found our guy. The team, Tracy, Kacie, and Joey were a pleasure to work with. Extremely prompt with replies to questions and concerns. Joey made sure to go over the timeline with me, to make sure we had the proper flow. Our photographers were Nathan and Austin. They were such a joy to work with. Very easy going, and even managed to get some giggles and smiles out of my 5yr old niece. Nathan directed us well with photos, poses, and with the flow for the reception. I would have been lost without him. My husband and I had so much fun during our photo shoot on the beach, just outside of Chart House Redondo, where we had our reception. Once we saw our pictures online, we were amazed and pleasantly surprised with their artistic talent. They were truly able to capture such beautiful memories. Now our most difficult decision is choosing photos. We want them all!! They’re all beautiful! I do not have enough kind words for this company. They are a very professional team, and the kind of company that you would trust to handle such a special day. I HIGHLY recommend Joey Ikemoto Photography for your wedding or special event. You will not be disappointed at all!<//text>< user>

<Review>Absolutely amazing!  Joey and his team made the photography aspect of our wedding absolutely stress-free!  What a wonderful experience!  Hands down one of the best decisions we made for our big day.  Everything was detailed and timelined so perfectly.  We didn't worry about a thing!  Our photographer, Sam and his assistant Austin, were wonderful.  Sam was able to capture so many stunning moments.  He was even able to get our two six-year olds to smile and laugh throughout the day.  Thank you for making our big day that much more special and for caputring so many priceless memories beautifully.<//Review>< userid>

I can't speak highly enough of Joey Ikemoto as my wedding photographer.  Not only did he capture the emotion and love of the day, he was a wonderful resource for two of my other vendors--florist and videographer--who were excellent to work with as well.  Joey and his staff are true professionals.  My Fiancé did not want to feel like he was being photographed all night long and Joey put him at ease during our engagement session and got all the shots I wanted on the wedding day without it feeling too staged or posed.   By far, the best decision I made in planning my wedding was hiring Joey.  If I could give him 10 stars, I would!< /Review>

<text>We got married on May 19th in Redondo Beach. We were excited to book with them, since we had seen amazing photos that Sam had taken at many places, including our venue. We booked Sam both for our Mendhi party two days before the wedding, and for the wedding day itself. Sam was friendly and easy to work with. He made sure to get all the shots we had requested, and he was really good at picking up on key moments that should be photographed. So far we have seen our amazing preview photos on the blog and they made us very happy!< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dd4ab0b74bfbd7:0xee1cef4317385cab<//gmap_id></record>

< review>
We got married at the Wayfarer's Chapel in October.  We looked at several photographer options.  We only needed a photographer  for the ceremony since we were from out of town and our reception would be later at a different venue.  We are also not a typical couple,  both of us being over 6'3 and I have a medical condition  that I am insecure about especially in pictures.  We also wanted photographer's who knew how to work with the Wayfarer's chapel, which is all glass so has specific lighting issues, and a short alotted time to get married which is very regimented and limited so we knew we had to make the time count and wanted the best we could get.
There were so many reasons we chose Joey and his colleagues.  First they were very flexible with what we needed, they had a package that met our needs where other photographers did not (we didn't need an engagement session and only needed hours at the church, and no reception coverage).   They are very affordable, especially for their high quality services, and offer many different packages.  They  have photographed weddings at the Wayfarer's church for years so they were so familiar with the best spots to get the best shots, especially at 2:00 in the afternoon (the hardest light time in the day), and they knew how to move us around the church to get the great shots while being discrete so guests and we didn't see each other before the ceremony. The church staff the whole time also said how they love when Joey & his team photograph, and they really worked well with each other to coordinate our time.   They were familiar with the lighting issues and structure of the church knowing where to stand and be to get the best coverage of our event.   They are also all very educated in their field, and receive a lot of training, and from what I can tell are  required to do continued education and trainings to stay expert in their skills.
Our photographer was Henry and his assistant.  We met with Joey a couple days before.  I asked if they could work around my condition, and went over how things would flow and what was important to us.
On the day of our wedding, Henry was there before us to meet.  Without even a flinch or a whole new discussion, he simply affirmed he went over everything with Joey, and understood what we needed, and gave me a nod and assured me what I had talked with Joey about and I had nothing to worry about.  This in itself was worth everything to me!  Everything! It can be so hard to have to go over things again and again, and see how people react ect, and right off he never had a reaction and made me feel at ease. He was so kind, so professional, organized, and really knew how to work in a very fast and effective way to make everyone feel comfortable,  get what he needed from everyone, even the kids,  and maximized the limited time we had to get all the important pictures we needed.
I would recommend Joey and his colleagues over and over without any hesitation.  Especially if you are getting married at the Wayfarer's Chapel.
We were so blessed to have had a dream wedding at a dream venue and the best photographers to capture it all!
On your special day,  you only get one chance to get things right!  One chance to capture it the way you hope it can be, and want the best you can get who can get it right, which without a doubt they did!<//review>

<review>I have been working with USBF for about 5 years now and they always do their job very well. Everyone I have worked with has been very helpful. They answer calls in a timely manner, are extremely professional and always find the lowest rates. I couldn't ask for better people to talk and explain. Unfortunately, my bank isn't and isn't very helpful. Not to mention they got the money I needed ASAP. My previous lenders were great but this new type of acquisition bank is not for their customers. Great business to work with! Thank you for making me feel like a person again. Will work with them forever!< /review></record>

Incredibly helpful customer service. Any questions I had about the loan process were answered promptly and thoroughly. If you’re looking to get working capital for your business I would highly recommend US business funding. Makes the whole process quick and easy</Review>

Hello, I met a group of great people in my work, great professionals but above all great and beautiful people; always willing and tolerant and with a pleasant smile when engaging in conversation with them. Unfortunately, he has not done it in the same way and his collaboration has not been much. The old workers were great, but the new workers at this stage are not focused on finding their clients. Anyway, thank you very much for treating me with familiarity and making me feel part of you.</review>

working with USBF is amazing! They are all very helpful and very professional. They've been doing a great job for about three years now, whether it's raising funds or offering the lowest rates, always finding the best way, all very quickly and quickly. Gratitude!<//review>

Working with USBF is one of the best choices I have ever made. They are professional, genuinely polite, very fast and responsive. There rates are very low, so I don't need to worry about over-budgeting my finances. I will definitely continue to work with them in the future.< /Review>

Everyone I worked with was very helpful. I couldn't ask for better people to talk with and explain. Unfortunately my bank doesn't and hasn't been very helpful. My previous lenders were great but the new breed under this bought out bank (Nicolet National Bank) are not out for their customers. Thank you for making me feel like a person again.</Text>

I have been working for the last few years but I have enjoyed working with USBF and they always do an excellent and admirable job and they call back on time, are really really professional, and always get the lowest score Huh. And never giving me a chance to complain, I liked this work very much, not to mention that I will get the necessary funds as soon as possible. This is fine business to work with and I wish we were with them. Always keep working!< /Text>

The attendants I dealt with were all kind and answered me assertively. I couldn't ask for better people to talk and explain. Unfortunately my bank has not served me well.

I have worked with USBF for more than 5 years. They are  amazing and very helpful and understanding. I would much invite anyone wherever you are to try them out. They are best in Business and in answering questions, calls are picked at once and moreover, they give funds as soon as possible. You won't regret once you join USBF. Thank you so much for being helpful.< /text>

I have a long term working relationship with USBF for more than 6 years now and they do an excellent job in what they are doing. They are extremely professional, who always find the lowest possible rates when lending and they respond on time. They get the funds as soon as posible whenever I would normally need it. It's been a pleasure doing business with them and forever will work with them.< /text>

<text>I have been with a different company, but when I know about the USBF, my life totally changed. I will never ever look for another and will stay loyal with USBF. They would really help you in different ways like equipment financing, working capital and small business loan solutions. Great company to work with! Hope this will help you decide.</text>< Pics>

The customer relations and offers provided by US Business Funding are a top notch. As a small startup business, the flexibility in the terms and condition accompanied with the method of payment are so friendly that you don't feel pressured to settle debts. Also the solutions offered me by their professionals has greatly influenced my business's output.< /review>

<review>I ordered a case of dessert wine for new year party. Despite using the holiday schedule, nothing turn up in time but it took nearly a week and three seperate customer service enquires to get an explanation from the company about what had happened. Eventually i got a short email stating they'd taken my money deposit not having the item in stock. The shop took another nine days to process my refund.
The company should adjust their system to let people know whether the items are in stock or not so they dont crest falls explanation that goods will arrive in time. There should be a short processing time for refunds and better customer service.<//review>< Pics>

US Business Funding recently provided my business with a loan to expand our work force and on-board new employees. The process was simple and very quick. I will definitely use them in the future! Thanks Dana for all your help and knowledgeable advice.< /Text>

This scum is relentless in their emails, 3-4 PER DAY.  I have contacted them to remove me from their list and they continue to email me daily.  I cannot block their emails, they continue to get thru our security - therefore, it must be a scam, fraud, or certainly not desirable people to do business with.< /review>

I had never used any sort of alternative financing and finally decided to get a few quotes from private lenders. USB was the most responsive and helpful through the process and I will certainly be continuing the relationship for future needs.<//review>

After communicating with Amanda Warlick for several days and submitting all necessary documentation to complete my application,  Amanda started to question my 100% ownership of my business.  I realize at this point after US Business Funding informed me that they can not move forward with funding my loan, they are discriminating against me because I am a female business owner in a predominantly male industry.< /Text>

<review>We worked with Chris Ellis to obtain our PPP loan and couldn't have been more impressed with his professionalism and quick response to any questions or concerns we had. Oddly enough, he actually picks up his phone when you call him. With his guidance we received all of our funds when many other businesses have not when working with going through other lenders.

I was in the middle of applying for a loan and had spent a considerable amount of time submitting financials when Mary emailed me to set up a time to discuss the terms.  She said she would call at a certain time but didn't specify what area code.  I asked her to clarify since I noticed she worked out of California.  I told her I was available from 9-12 MST.  She emailed me back that noon would work her time.  I emailed her that would not work since that would mean 1 pm my time.  She then emailed me back she could do "8:30 which was 11:30 my time".  Confused, I emailed her back that my time was only one hour different than hers and I again asked for clarification due to my busy schedule and I didn't want to miss our appointment.  She responded in a snarky manner, telling me "for the second time, I said 8:30".  Still not telling me whether that was her time or my time I had to ask again because I was not available at 8:30 my time.  I used the expression "hells bells" and she responded that I shouldn't swear at her!  I couldn't believe it.  I told her that was just an expression and she shouldn't take offense to it.  She then unilaterally cancelled my application process after all the work I put in.  She refused to ever acknowledge that she was responsible for three reschedules due to her not paying attention to details.  This demonstrates her lack eye for detail, easily offended, and unprofessional termination of my application because she felt slightly embarassed by her repeated mistakes and not wanting to take any responsibility.  I tried to ask for her supervisor and she wouldn't provide that info.  I will say that once I got ahold of a supervisor he did call me back promptly (Brent Stanton) and he was very professional.  He told me he would hook me up with another representative.  I will see how that goes and keep you updated.

Update (8.15.21)

: Brent called me back and reassured me that his company would assist me still and apologized for any miscommunication on his company’s end and I apologized to him for any misunderstandings on my end  and I think we are good now. I’ll keep you posted. Upgraded from 1 to four stars .

UPDATE (8.20.20):  Although I was told I was "prequalified" for $150,000-200,000, Brent just notified me that he can only do $20,000, "if that." He mentioned he was concerned because he saw that I had written a less than steller review for his associate, above.  But since I had written nice things about him he would fund me.

I have a near perfect credit score, haven't missed one payment in 15 years, and have over two million dollars in real estate holdings and they won't lend me over $20,000?  Come on!  So I went out and got exactly what I needed through another lender within one week.  Good luck US Business Funding!

Downgraded from four to one star.  I put in hours and hours of work sending documents and was told I was "prequalified" but then later told I couldn't get a tenth of that amount.  What a waste of time.<//Text>

While i was given an opportunity to grow my business, but did not have the funds i reached out to US BUSINESS FUNDING. I delt with rick kenyon. He was very proffesional and guided me thru the process.   US BUSINESS FUNDING has alot of reviews and some of them scared me but still went thru the process.  I was funding alot of money in 3 days.   RICK know how to close a deal. Best thing i ever did   Hope to keep making deals with rick every few months  i would givd them 10 stars if it was a choice.<//Review>

Professional yet personal attention. Speed to funding was within 72 hours. Information needed by underwriting was easily accessible digitally from banks and accounting programs. USB Funding rep, Jonathan Barnes was patient and supportive with my additional questions. Rates are within reason for the market (mid range to high mid range.) Funding to bank account fast. Terms great as over 5 years with no prepayment penalties. Great for projects and paying down credit cards.</text>

<username>Airline Skate Center<//username><Review>Applied for a loan back April 1, 2020 with Chris Ellis and he advised the loan was in process with SBA. Chris called in about a month ago and said SBA had loan info and they were waiting for an answer from SBA. As of May 29, 2020 we didn't get any responses to our emails and left him voicemails on his direct line with no return call. We were finally able to reach him via telephone today and he said the loan was never submitted to SBA which is not what he told us over a month back. It's obvious this guy doesn't run a business during COVID-19 and lacks communication.< /Review>< Response>

<text>I couldn't recommend US Business Funding highly enough. I came to them in a rush, I had a piece of equipment ready to roll and another lender I had been working with jacked their rate up at the last second. Derek quoted me a better rate right away and worked tirelessly to get the deal closed ASAP. I hope I never have to work with another lender again, Derek and US Business Funding are a dream come true.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>The person I worked with was Chris Ellis and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I was very hesitant at first but Chris was very good at pointing out things in my contract that can save me a ton of money for the payback of my loan. This guy could be a contract attorney, if you work with him you will not regret it. Instead of disregarding things that tend to be overlooked by many lending institutions he made sure I understood how to use certain products thank you!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>I reached out to US Business Funding to get a quote on a loan. Jordan Groves was who i spoke with.  I explained that we had an offer from another company and i went over the details.  Jordan told me that i had a very good offer and we should pursue that offer. This was extremely valuable and much appreciated! We run a company and one of our core values is we give advice with no regard to getting a job and we advocate for our customers money. It is very important that we deal with companies with the same values as our company. Jordan and US Business funding is that kind of company are that kind of company. I highly recommend them!!

I am concerned mostly about the ethics of this organization.  Beware that they charge a $495 fee to "setup an account with them."  Everyone (apparently) receives a 50,000 "line reservation" offer (at 25% cost of capital) that is changed during the underwriting process.  In my case, the line went lower, the payment changed from weekly to daily and increased from 25% to 30% cost of capital.

For a small business, early in it's growth and development, that is an unsustainable cost and certainly not good for my business.  I feel swindled and sold to - the advertisement and the experience definitely do NOT match.

Steer clear of this organization... I am just praying the give me the $495 "account setup fee" back and that I never hear from them again.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Rick was terrific to work with.  Professional, patient, and a good partner.  He took time to explain options to me, along with pros and cons.  Also, he clearly is looking to build long-term relationships with his clients, as opposed to simply offering what is convenient and lucrative for him which is what his competitors do.  I look forward to working with Rick on our financial needs for many years.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Rick Kenyon from US Business Funding had my best interest at heart throughout the loaning process. He took time and care to understand my business plans and goals. Rick Kenyon was genuinely interested in growth of my business and made acquiring a working capital loan a seamless process. Rick Kenyon made himself more than available by constantly following up and guiding me every step of the way. US Business Funding understood my urgency and adapted accordingly to my needs. With US Business Funding’s help, my business will be able to expand and grow exponentially. I recommend US Business Funding to any business owner. Thank you for believing in me and my business.< /text>

Just spoke with Charles who called me about lending my company money or establishing a line of credit, as I had possibly (not sure if I ever did or not, but I still took the call as I was in a good mood if you read down you'll also see why). I was very impressed with his soft sell approach, as some people who call people on the phone can be WAY too aggressive the moment you hear their voice and their first words coming out of their mouth. Charles was first of all, and this is why I continued to talk to him, friendly and in a good mood, and had that "nice guy" sound to his voice that just made me want to hear what he had to say. I've worked as a lender, doing both calls to current customers, and calls to leads, as well as even cold calls, so  I know what it's like to do a job like his and always try to at least let them say hello and tell me who they are and what they want before I tell someone I'm not interested and to take me off their list. Well, I didn't do this at all with him. I am currently not in a financial place to work with his company, but I wanted to make sure that someone recognizes just HOW WELL he does his job, and I hope his manager sees this, as I've been a business owner, and have hired and fired and done reviews given raises, fired people, all that stuff. If I was in a place to do so, I'd have offered him a job on the spot! He's incredibly professional but in very friendly way, and can talk about the products his company offers in a way that anyone can understand, which is important in any business. He offered to send me an email with information which I happily accepted and will keep in a folder where other lenders have sent me emails but because he went above and beyond to help me in a number of ways, when I qualify to do business on his company's level, His company will be the FIRST I'll call and CHARLES will be the only person I'll work with unless he's been promoted which I wouldn't doubt or has moved on to a job paying  him double to money! I'm hoping he's still there when  I'm ready so he can at least send me to someone in his company he trusts even if he's been promoted, which I highly recommend. At least, A raise is most likely due at his next performance review!!! Regards, Bryan Grandy</Text>

<text>Once again I highly recommend US Business Funding.  When it was time to receive additional funding for our restaurant, Matthew Connell was helpful and very easy to work with throughout the process.  He provided all the information and answered any questions needed for further explanations.  Not only did they consolidate our loans, but also brought down our interest rate.  It was a pleasure working with US Business Funding, and would definitely work with them again.  Thanks for the support and positive experience!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Our company does city, county and state contracts. We only do government contracts in California. Sometimes our government contracts delay paying our invoices for a number of different reasons. US Business Funding (USBF) made a loan to our company because of a delay of receiving a large payment from one of our government contracts. As a business man it is important to have a company like USBF supporting your cash flow requirements in order to keep your company operating at full capacity. I highly recommend USBF to any company that might need support to your cash flow requirements or in case of an emergency situation that could impact your companies operation.

Thank You "US Business Funding" your support came at the right time and was greatly appreciated.

Gus Franklin, President</text>

<text>US Business Funding came through and made it possible to get the funding we needed. It was easy and fast. Honestly I was skeptical. I looked into it several times before actually responding. Their persistence paid off. Every aspect was explained and every question was answered. This helped get things moving.

<text>I am still in disbelief....we met Michael on a Saturday in Miami and shared with him in 5 minutes or less our complicated situation.  He took down our name, email address and phone number that same day he sent us the application.  On Monday when he got back to his office in Philadelphia he started processing our application and within 72 hours the funds were in the account—that simple, that fast and the efficient.< /text><gmapID>0x80dcdecac61c2a31:0xa9e7a593ebd77186</gmapID><date>1550711944036< /date><Response>None< /Response>< pictures>

<pictures>None<//pictures><rating>2<//rating><Text>This company sent my company an email trying to get us to do a business line of credit with them.  I delayed doing anything with the application because they wanted me to pay $281 a day for 6 months on a $25,000 loan.  In her email Dana Feddrix assured me that those were preliminary numbers and would change once the underwriters reviewed it.  I went ahead and applied just to see what they came back with.  I also told Dana that I had concerns about the document that they wanted me to sign, and told her that I didn't want them putting any money into my account without me agreeing to the amount and interest.  I should also have mentioned that they shouldn't take anything OUT of my account.  The agreement also mentioned a $595 funding fee.  I have had MCAs for my company before and although the funding fee was a bit high I still wanted to see what they presented me and figured that the funding fee would be taken out AFTER the loan was approved and funded.  Last friday I noticed that $595 was pending processing to be removed from my account.  I figured that meant that I had been approved for the funding.   I got an email today from Dana stating that underwriting had declined to fund.  I traced the money withdrawn from my business account to US Business Funding.  I have sent an email and left a VM with Dana Feddrix and I am now waiting to see what she says.  I have never done business with a company that takes out funding fees whether you are approved or not.

**edit** I just received an email from Dana explaining that the funds are withdrawn once the packet is sent to underwriting and that she had submitted a request to have the funds put back in my account.  I am grateful for that but still astonished that they withdraw the funding fee before they even fund the line of credit or loan.</Text><time>1575333942874<//time><username>James Davis</username>< gmapID>

My experience with US business Funding was at the most maximum level greatness. Melanie is hands down the best agent to work with, very knowledgeable, full of patience and the nicest person to talk with, especially when this was our first lending experience. My husband and I highly recommend and will be using US business funding in the future. Thanks Melanie for everything!<//Review>

Most unethical and horrible spammers. We have asked them multiple times to remove us from their list. We called and they were extremely rude and hung up on us.

Do not use their unsubscribe link because it will only subscribe you another "sales person's" email account.

It is impossible to get off their email list and they spam you daily. The best thing is to block the URL in your mail server account.

I would never trust them in a lending contract.< /Text>

I've worked with them for 3 years now and I feel great about my experience with them. The staff is very efficient at explaining their services and financing terms.

This company is a fraud!!!  They use bait and switch interest rate and loan agreement language.   They will sell you a low interest rate loan for equipment, then you sign a contract different than what you talked about or previously agreed upon.  Ex:  They send you a preliminary agreement of a loan with a 5.95% interest loan and for 3 years.  Sound great right?  Then they send you a contract showing your monthly payment and lock you in for more months than you originally agreed upon.  Even if you pay it off early, you are responsible for all the months including interest.  They trick you by not putting the interest rate in the contract.  Total interest comes to over 18%.  Deceitful Fraud!!< /text>

<Text>These people fish business owners via e mail and give them incorrect information! their rep called me and told me they just want to verify who I am and need to fill out a small verification form! the next day I saw them pull my credit report on 3 different credit bureau! Called them back and a fast talking manager got on the phone and tried to twist everything around!! very unprofessional!! if your business looking for lower rates on the money you borrow, I would highly suggest not to mess with these guys!!! very unprofessional and sound like loan sharks!! by the way, the highly recommended positive reviews can be very easily be cooked up!! do NOT believe it!! it only takes couple thousand box to get these pages up!!!<//Text>< pics>

Service beyond expectation.
Being a small Company in Business for 24 years we have used several types of funding sources over the years. When Banks say know and you still need funding going out to the open market can be a real nightmare!
US Business Funding was a pleasure to deal with. Dealing with William Labovic  our Consultant was exceptional. I highly recommend US Business Funding!<//Text>

I had a very positive experience with George Myrick who was in regular communication with me every day as we went through the funding process. He and his team moved fast and offered us a variety of funding options. This is a very different experience from working with a bank, but he helped us get funding quickly when we needed it!< /text>

I received an e-mail from Trevor Battle with some spammy business loan garbage. His e-mail said, "Per our last conversation...." Well I tell you what Trevor, I've never talked to you in my life so you're hoping to start out a business relationship with a lie? Seems like a garbage business to me.< /text>

<review>When I set up my loan, they took the purchase price and divided it by 60 payments. Peter explained that if I made all the payments that the equipment would be mine at the end of 60 payments. At the end, they said I still owed them an additional 10%.I had already paid them sales tax on the entire amount plus the finance charges. They seem great until you think you are all done paying.<//review></record>

Their rep was professional and politely persistent so we could "get'er done". Once my paperwork was submitted, their staff of underwriters got us approved in a few days and the rest went as planned. As a seasonal business relying on timely buying power, having USB in our corner is giving us some real leveraging power. This will keep us growing and was very much needed for our business model.<//review>

I highly recommend this company.  The service was prompt and efficient.
Peter Ribeiro was always available to answer any questions that I had.
If we need funding again this is where we will get it.< /text>

<Text>They wanted $60,000 for a $40,000 loan. In 6 months. When i told the senior financial advisor,
William Labovic, that that is $10,000 more than other people asked in paying back. And in reply he said, “your company is trash. You dont deserve to even speak to a lender, peace out”. And he hung up on me. What a disgrace. Disgusting character. If i ever spoke to a client that way, i wouldn't be in business. Go to someone who will treat you and you company with respect. Thats not what us business funding is about.<//Text>< pictures>

This is a terribly unprofessional company, we decided to not work with them because they wanted to make us establish credit with them by getting a loan of 25k and pay them back 35k. When we TUMULA GRIFFIN we were not going to accept he rudely responded with “thanks for not taking our funds you have shown you don’t pay on time” after they had tried to charges us an “activation fee” of $400. I have a screen shot of his email. Very unprofessional and rude!! Don’t work with them there’s so many other companies out there that we have worked with that are so much better.</text>

<Review>I've worked with US Business Funding on several deals for my businesses. They are leaders in their field and this is evident in their knowledge and customer service. Peter, Cody, and Josh are the few I've worked with and they really impressed me. More importantly, I knew I could trust them and their advice. What a valuable asset to have!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcdecac61c2a31:0xa9e7a593ebd77186</Gmap_id>< Name>

I worked with Jourdan Groves at USB Funding.  I have had business loans in the past that were a nightmare.  HE MADE IT EASY!!!  It went exactly how he said it would.  I am so grateful for the honesty and the detailed manor in which he works.   He asked for document one time ( i messed it up but he was patient)  There was no back and forth of nitpick stuff like i have had in the past.  This was the most strait forward, simple process.

Thank you for you integrity and commitment to service.    I strongly recomment USB Funding for business needs.

absolutely the worst experience in my life! Be honest! Say NO. But instead they tell you (CODY) everything you want to hear. " Get your LOC replenished after 6 months"  Perfect. a seasonal business with no cash flow in January. Get another $92,000 after 6 months of repayment! It is perfect for my seasonal business!! Then January turns to February, then March, then April, 15, then April 27th!!!!!! An absolute scam!!!! US Business Funding AND National Funding (who is the creditor) are both sketchy at best. Biggest mistake I ever made in business!! Stay AWAY < BEWARE, FRAUD, HORROR.....Not to mention 40% interest and no response when asking for documentation!! PLEASE DO NOT CALL THESE PEOPLE< /Text>

The business is a border line con-artist scheme.  The offer went from 3.9% per to 32.% interest rate.   The documents presented were fraud compared to the agreed and discussed terms.   This company wasted valuable time and resources.  Don't waste your time..   I would bet the other reviews are paid or falsified.</Text>

Our company was completely mislead. We were told that a 6 month term loan would be best for us, as we only needed the money for two months. Paying it off after only 2 months would mean we would be charged 10% or less in interest. When we paid it off we were charged just shy of the 6 month amount, which was 30%. WAY more than we were told. The servicing company said US Business funding completely mislead us, as they have no loans that work like that in any capacity. USBF is friendly on the phone, but it is completely manipulative and shady. Do not use them, unless you want to pay extreme interest rates.<//review>

Christopher Rodriguez, senior financial consultant and my financial advisor at USBF, has always been professional, quick to respond and has shown real concern for my business. US Business Funding is just what small businesses need in these times where banks are sluggish to provide capital and make it a long-drawn-out process.<//text>

They offered us $3K and then proceeded to charge us their activation fee even though we declined their offer.   We have worked with many lenders over the years and this company is predatory and we believe fraudulent.   We will be disputing the activation fee and reporting them to BBB.

Was able to get the funding I needed.  High interest rate, but you take what you can get to move forward.</Review>

<review>Unethical, bait and switch business practices with rates similar to the or loan sharks. They take advantage of business owners too busy to do their homework (basically just go to your bank and get a line of credit). These guys appeal to you by offering easy terms and fast funding but then will have you fill out as much paperwork and submit the same piles of paper as your bank but then they want to charge you rates that should be illegal. Someone should investigate them. Complete scam! Stay away!</review><gmap_id>0x80dcdecac61c2a31:0xa9e7a593ebd77186</gmap_id><Name>Deborah R.P.</Name>< Resp>

< review>
They were very courteous and professional.  However, they were misleading in our phone conversations about the cost of their funds.  The TRUE APR in the documents presented after our call was more than twice the interest rate compared to how they wordsmithed their presentation of interest expense over the phone.  If you are not financially saavy, you should talk to an accountant before you borrow funds from USB so you understand the true cost of funds.< /review>

I was treated with so much respect, I had an usual situation needing capital for my Company and Renee listened to my problem and offered the perfect solution.  She actually cared about my needs rather than just telling me what to do. I highly recommend US Business Funding, they find solutions.<//Review>

<Review>Misleading email saying 3.75% line of credit available.

When speaking with them after submitting an application they explained they don’t offer traditional lines of credit with a specific interest rate.

Might be good for someone looking to fund a  project that a bank will not fund.< /Review><Rating>1</Rating>< user_name>

I get spam email from these lowlifes on a constant basis, referring to a company I worked for years ago, with shady come-ons alluding to some previous “conversation” that never occurred and offering me grand amounts in credit.  Went to their website and chatted with “Ephraim” in order to determine whether they were, in fact, using a spam email marketer, or were simply having their business name used as a cover.  I’m convinced they know exactly what is going on.  No legitimate company uses these marketing tactics.  If I could give them 0 stars, I would.  Avoid like the plague and the scummy con-men that they are.<//review>

<text>I went through these people to get a business lease. Once the lease was written I signed it and sent them a $981 deposit. A few days later they sent a new lease and had altered the terms. I refused to sign the new terms and asked for my money back but they refused. I have tried to negotiate a settlement and even had an attorney write a letter but they refuse to return my money. These people are not a legitimate business.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdecac61c2a31:0xa9e7a593ebd77186< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They use harassment and deception as their marketing tactics. They use multiple email domains to avoid spam filter detection and the unsubscribe button in their email does nothing.

When confronted they simple state the person making the complaint is 'making a false claim'. When confronted with evidence to the contrary they stop responding.

US Business Funding gave me an option for getting a loan from other than a traditional bank. I recommend working with Dana. She is honest and gets the job done.<//Text>

I received an email saying I was 'pre-approved' for a specific loan with a specific amount. I then replied and said I wanted to pursue the loan they pre-approved me for. They responded by saying 'what type of loan do you want?' I responded 'the one you pre-approved me for'. This went around in circles and they refused to provide any information on the loan they 'pre-approved' me for. I don't trust any funding sources that send out thousands of emails indiscriminately and spam business people with 1980's style bait and switch tactics. This was clearly a bait and switch tactic and they spam business owners by the droves with these shady tactics.< /text>

<text>I inquired about getting a loan for my business and they told me that I was approved pending under writers approval and would be funded in three days. I had to send them $495.00 first which would be refunded if the under writers did not approve the application. Once my check was cashed I never heard another word back form them. I have left at least a dozen messages with Justin and not once has he called me back! When I call the main line and would press 3 for customer service, it keeps ringing. I let it ring for 23 minutes one time with no answer. It has been a month now with no response. Stay away from these people. I don't think they are legit.< /text>< userid>

Complete scam artists. Have received 20 + emails referencing a phone conversation that never happened with a fictious "Pat Jones". I have called USB multiple times to have the emails stop. The insisted it can only be done by "unsubscribing" which will only validate your emailing as a working address and trigger additional spam. I suggest that anyone being harassed by this company contacted the Attorney General of California.

Unfortunately Google requires you to give a 1 star rating to make a comment so my real rating is 0.< /review>

Constant spam from these people is getting ridiculous.  Cody Struckhoff is the main person I get them from.  5-8 per day and I have never spoken with them, signed up for information through them or anything.  This company has to be a scam the way they conduct themselves.  I have filed a complaint with the Indiana Attorney General on them< /text>

Lần đầu tiên liên hệ với họ, tôi cứ nghĩ mọi việc chắc có lẽ sẽ không khả quan, nhưng thật bất ngờ tôi đã được họ giải đáp hướng dẫn tận tình. Họ tiếp nhận cuộc gọi của tôi nhanh chóng, trả lời và hướng dẫn một cách cực kỳ chuyên nghiệp và tư vấn cho tôi tìm thấy mức giá thấp nhất. Đây là một doanh nghiệp tạo cho tôi sự tin tưởng ngay từ lúc ban đầu.  Tôi sẽ còn tiếp tục hợp tác cùng USBF.< /Review>< Name>

(Translated by Google) When I first met this USBF bank, I did not imagine that it would be a bank that would really meet the needs of its customers, today I see that I was mistaken because I have been with this bank for a few years and even today I have had no problems, on the contrary, I am very satisfied. Because in addition to being a safe bank, its service is first-rate, with well-trained professionals capable of resolving any doubts and not to mention the ease of obtaining funds with fees really below and without bureaucracy quickly and safely. It is very good to be a customer and work with this bank. I am sure that we will always be partners.

(Original)
Quando conheci este banco USBF não imaginei que seria um banco que realmente atenderia as necessidades de seus clientes, hoje vejo que estava enganado pois ja faz alguns anos que estou com este banco e até hoje não tive problemas pelo contrario estou muito satisfeito. Pois além de ser um banco seguro seu atendimento é de primeira linha, com profissionais bem treinados e capacitados a resolver qualquer duvida  e sem falar  da facilidade de conseguir fundos com taxas realmente abaixo e sem burocracias de forma rápida e segura. É muito bom ser cliente e trabalhar com este banco. Tenho certeza que seremos parceiros sempre.</Text>

(Translated by Google) USBF "Thank you very much". Since I have been working with you 4 years ago, I have felt your quality in the excellent prices and professional attention. Through these lines I express my deepest gratitude for the assistance you have given me when I have needed to call you and request funds for my company. They have the lowest prices, adapted to the needs of each applicant.
