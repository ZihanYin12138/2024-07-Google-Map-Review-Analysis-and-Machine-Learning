This place is hella rad. The employees are super friendly and very helpful. We rented boards and it was super easy and fast. Then, when I went to return my gear, the owner was there. He was really candid and helped me with a decision on new gear. I'll definitely be giving them my business from there on. Good people, great store, great choices, and good vibes.< /text>

<Text>I don't normally give "5 Star" reviews because I seldom think that anything is "perfect", BUT I had a perfect experience with Milo yesterday.  I was thinking of buying some snowboards for my two boys Amazon or some other mass merchandiser, but a friend told me to call Milo before I made any decisions.  I was helped by Brady at Milo and the experience was great.  He is extremely knowledgeable and excellent with customer service.  Brady answered all of my questions - that would've never been answered on other sites.  I ended up buying (2) snowboard packages with confidence that I got exactly the right boards and the best price.  And, they told me to bring the boards back for a free waxing.  I shipped to (2) different locations with no hassles and they even wrote a "happy birthday" note for one of the shipments.  Later, I received a follow up call from Brady.  Excellent customer service, excellent board shop.  The whole experience re-shaped how I am going to buy all products in the future - more local, "real" shops and less of the bland amazon experience.  You'd be LOCO to buy anywhere else. Thank you Brady at Milo!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>Best place to buy snowboards. I purchased a capita  board and Union bindings from milo two weeks ago. I received great service, they mounted my bindings while in the store, and even helped pick out some gear for my kids. Took the board out today and it was better than they described.  I will only buy my snowboarding gear from milo.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Milo Snow and Skate is AWESOME!

I needed a new board before going on a trip and they were able to take an order over the phone from Maryland and get it shipped to me within 3 days!!  I had been to Milo last time I was in Auburn and loved the shop's vibe. Even from Maryland they did nothing but provide the best service.  Real people with a true passion for serving the snow/skate community!

Thanks Milo!!</Review>

Best board shop in northern CA, the staff is extremely knowledgeable on the products due to them being avid riders and they wont try to upsale you into buying boards/equipment that are beyond your skill level, I've been doing business with these guys for over a decade and they have always steered me right! Support your local board shop, dont buy from big box stores or online companies!<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I love this shop. One of the best if not the best snowboard shop on the West Coast, and it's right here in Auburn! These guys are genuine people and are snowboarders themselves, who share the same passion I do for riding. They know all there is to know about boarding and they carry top notch brands and also feature amazing companies that are small, but are on the rise. Service is as quick as you want it, but if you wanna chat it up with them they are some of the coolest guys I have met. I go to this shop just to hang out, even if I am not buying anything! If you have any interest in snowboarding or skating, look no further and just head over to the shop. You will not be disappointed!</Text>< pictures>

Awesome place to shop! One of the best shops serving those in the Auburn and Lake Tahoe areas (and many from the Bay Area like myself). Always a wonderful place to pick up some gear for skate and/or snow! An extremely knowledgable and welcoming staff keeps myself along with a huge customer base coming back for all of our clothing and equipment needs. It's nice to still have a few places like this one that is genuine and also gives back to the community!< /Review>

They took their time until I got exactly what I wanted. They even stayed open late for me too. I'm so happy to see skateboarding still going strong,I vote yes, to Milos .#Rep #Support

Local here in Auburn and saw a new shop opened up so naturally had to check it out. One of the workers, Alex, came up to me and was very helpful and showed me whatever I wanted to see even though I was just checking the place out. Went in the next week and got a pair of sweet Janoskis for $40 bucks. These people know what they're talking about and I'd go down there any of the week to just get information and insight or to buy from their huge selection. Keep doing you guys, your shop is kickass.< /Review>

I would give it more stars if it didn't feel overpriced, especially when you're paying for three kids with one of those being a one-year old (Billy Beezs down the road is cheaper, bigger, and you get to go in/out all day).
This spot is $15/pp for ONE HOUR or $20/pp for two hours. I did appreciate that they allow you to upgrade. They also checked temps and had staff walking around sanitizing.</text>

<Text>This place is terrific. Parking in the mall parking lot was easy. The place is inside which is always a plus for weather and what not. The decorations of candy land are ADORABLE. Really, really clean. The staff was constantly cleaning and wiping things down. Also the staff was friendly! Which is rare. Everyone I spoke to was very nice and helpful. The place has lots of seats for parents. Also computer areas for you to do work while kids play. The food selection is pretty great. Lots to choose from. Everything was reasonably priced. We got a month pass which I think is a good deal. We can’t wait to come back.</Text>< Response>

Very clean. Decent price $15 for 60 minutes or $20 for 120 minutes. 1 adults get in free pre child admission. Pretty great place to let the kiddos burn energy. There is also snack and food in here. The thing that through me off was the mandatory purchase of grip sock. Other than that this place is great.<//Text>

<pics>None</pics><Review>This place was amazing! It was perfect for my 2 and 4 year old boys. They were able to explore freely while learning and getting lots of energy out. Plus it was a beautiful drive across the golden gate (first exit past the bridge). There is a huge field in front as well, so on a sunny day it seems like it would be perfect to bring a blanket and a picnic too.</Review>< userid>

Even some parents refused. Staff either did not notice or care. If you're at all worried about exposure, I'd wait. They do not enforce the mask rule like say Disneyland.<//review>< pictures>

Went on a Sunday around 3 p.m. and literally turned to leave right away as they were at capacity! The owner reassured me that my daughter would still enjoy herself despite the crowd, and surprisingly he was correct. Everyone was respectful of the rules (including face coverings), the snack bar was very reasonably priced, and as far as I could tell, no one was injured - at least while I was there. Nice way for kids to release wiggles and to get out of the house for an hour or two.< /Review>

Finally brought my 3 yr old to this place and he had the best time! We came to Main Place Mall during the weekend and we saw Candeeland but it was way too crowded so I waited to bring him on a weekday. We got there around noon today and it was perfect timing. Hardly anyone was there. Staff is consistently cleaning the playground, there is plenty of sanitizing stations, they check your temperature when you come in, and the manager ( today it was a younger guy)was  really helpful. Needless to say we’ll definitely be back!< /Review>

It's super nice and clean. I was surprised at how much fun my kids were having. The price was super reasonable too.  The staff is constantly wiping down the surfaces too which was refreshing. Little land is a fun place for my toddler to not have to worry about competing with older kids to play on different things. My kids are having an amazing time and we will be returning.< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I was excited to check out this new indoor playground. It met my expectations and more. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The play structures were super creative and can keep your kids entertained for a couple
of hours. The price point was great, they have lots of snacks and drinks to purchase and everything was super clean. I think it’s a great place for some active playtime or a birthday party. And adults can play too! We will definitely be coming back.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Having 3 kids, 4 and under, means we have been to a good number of indoor playgrounds in the area. This one was one of the best ones we have been to in awhile.

Every single staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. The facility was clean and there was a variety of obstacles for children to choose from. I especially liked seeing an employee, or two, on the floor at all times to ensure the safety of the children.

We will definitely be coming back!< /Review>

<Text>Fun place! They make excellent use of the space. Parents allowed to climb around but careful of the tighter spots! I hope the prices stay where they are, very good deal considering parents are free. Now, I know the name is Candeeland but maybe include a small section of healthier food and drink options?< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1581822562460, 'text': 'We are happy that everyone had a blast!

Tried out Candeeland on a Sunday afternoon, and check in was a breeze. You can sign waivers and pay in advance online! EVERYONE here was so friendly. I had the pleasure of meeting Peter at the exit. This place is so clean! I saw the employees cleaning often. The toddler area is for 5 and under only, which is great because your little ones won't get run over by the energetic big kids. It's great for parents that you can do only an hour of play because running after your kids is tiring! Just beware, your kids may cry when time is up! You need grip socks to play, but you can buy them for 2.50 at the front. Overall a great new place to take your kids.< /Text>

<Text>FANTASTIC place for kids. Brought my son she 2 and my wife brought her younger siblings ages 8 and 12 and they ALL had a great time. Super helpful and friendly staff checked on the kids and everything was kept nice and clean by them. Literally saw a guy walking around and vacuuming every 10 minutes!

It’s my daughters 3rd time being here and she loves every minute of it. When she saw the playground being built she couldn’t help but be excited about it. Every time we come to the mall; this is our first stop; very convenient for when kids have to too much energy.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Highly recommend! This place is very clean. I got to meet the owner. He sat down with us and talked about the difference party packages. They are very well priced and I’m super happy what we’re getting for  the price. My son loves it here. He struggled in school.. once this place opened we started using coming on Saturday As reward for good behavior and this has helped him with behavioral issues at school! The manager (little talk, today wearing a dark blue shirt) is always very nice and goes over the top for his guest. I’ve personally seen him walk around to all the parents and shake hands and talk with them all while cleaning and making sure his staff is doing things.

You can tell the safe of the kids are #1 there have cameras throw the whole play area. You can see it near the snack area. The workers keep walking throw the whole play area to make sure all kiddos are safe. My son went down the slide and hurt his foot. I saw a safe member carrying him asking him what his parents looked like so I ran up to her and grabbed him to look at his foot, another staff member told me what happened and asked if they could give him ice he said yes, a manager came over asked him if he wanted ice. My son said yes they got him ice and kept checking on him. He was fine. Everyone here is amazing and can’t wait to have his party here!<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Brand new place. If your looking for an alternative to dingy playgrounds this is certainly a great and economical option for you and your family. Everyone from the owner of the establishment down is great with kids. Our child has gone twice since this location opened and he hasn’t stopped talking about it. He even picked Candeeland. Pricing per hour is more than reasonable for what your child gets. We are currently planning our child’s birthday party here. Membership for Candeeland will hopefully be improved but that is hardly a complaint of ours. Check this place out!
P.S please get rid of the Kidz Bop music....haha</Review>

(Translated by Google) Very good to let the children .... They have a lot of fun. I highly recommend it. And there is also a massage chair for the parents in the back. Loved it!!! They have a monthly plan of $ 35.00. And the one hour entrance fee is $ 15.00

< review>
Zara was very nice, but I’m out $424.72.

I bought a refurbished iPhone that wasn’t working properly. They said Apple would repair it for free. Apple said it was refurbished with aftermarket parts and they won’t cover it. Boost won’t take the phone back. I was a Boost customer for seven years because it saved me money. Now it’s costing me and I have to choose a new carrier.< /review>

The manager is really nice and welcoming and so is the cool cashier. He gave me good advice and has excellent communication skills that attract the average apathetic customer. I'm definitely going to keep my phone service with them.< /review>

<text>Zara is very patient and really helped me. I was on a old 35$ plan and only getting 1 GB data and no other store told me to change my plan and she actually changed my plan for me and now I get more data for the same price! She also helped me upgrade my phone and gave me a discount on the phone case! Very good customer service. Definitely recommend this store.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x809adf481289e6eb:0xd2d670252cdc907e< /gmapID></record>

However I just received an e-mail confirmation of a review I did not write praising this location that was published on the date I went in.

Sooo there's is also a good chance when the sales associate was transferring all my data on to my new phone they also went and left a positive review for themselves...

So you know :/ breach of security and all</text>< userid>

When I went into Boost Mobile,My family and I were greeted very nicely by a women named Zara. She was very helpful, polite and kind to us. She made sure we left with no questions. This was a very wonderful experience at a phone store unlike others that were very rude. Thank you so much Zara for everything you did for my family and I!!💖💖</review>

We always go to this store. We actually switched from Metro PCS to Boost and got 4 lines unlimited everything.  Zara is very kind and helpful. She always takes good care of her customers and makes sure they never have a bad experience. Thanks Zara!</review>

As far as stars and the LG tribute are concerned we are in the negatives..
However, Aliza was able to turn my frown upside down with her flawless customer service and cheery disposition. She is a keeper and I am now happy with boost again.. The end</Text>

The female employee refused to sell me a sim card, told me to go to the apple store theyll give me one...i have a note 8. They said they dk why she would say that. Soo I had to order one online and by time I got it the deal I was wanting was already over. She also lied about the deals they had and when I showed her them on the website and that that location was one of the participating ones (after she said her location doesnt have that deal),then was when she said she couldn't sell me a sim card. It was ridiculous .<//Text>

<Text>Carlyn is wonderful!  She’s was very thorough and patient in providing me all the information needed in making a trade/phone purchase. She’s also a great conversationalist, which made it feel like a good visit as you can some times be stuck in a store for a while (not the case today! Was so easy!). She was very gracious altogether and invited me to come back and see her if I needed anything at all. I’m huge on genuine customer service, and this girl’s got it. Side note: She is a Master at setting the phone shields. She knows the tricks of the trade.✨😌✨<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I travel to the San Dimas location because I have received excellent customer service.

<Text>Would recommend 0 stars and DO NOT go here, ive went there 3x, this last time we went, we left paying off a phone and adding 2 lines this was in Aug2020. I won't mention how long it took or the disregard that happened. But As of today: those reps had added a tracker to my account for a car, been billed for it, (as well as the device- never got one) and then, there's no sign of the payoff made on the phone we went to pay off AND Ive apparently been making payments towards it too! I've had to spend hours trying to clarify unnecessary charges every 2 to 3 months. I'm done with this carrier!</Text>< rate>

Came in to switch carriers from ATT (which I’ve had for 15+ years) to T-Mobile for 6 lines. Harry did a fantastic job helping me with the process, making it easy and painless! Besides getting me an awesome deal for my new family plan, he was also very helpful in answering the many questions I had in a friendly and pleasant manner. I really appreciate customer service like that. Thanks so much, Harry!! :)< /Text>

Harry Mazmanian was so helpful. I was ready to leave Sprint today when I came but he helped me and saw some things in my bill and lowered my bill. He was so patient with me and my questions. He is a great asset to your company. In my opinion  he should be promoted.
Thank you</Review>

<Text>Switched to T-Mobile and regretted it after 2 weeks. Found out they were charging me for additional items on my plan I had specifically told them no to in the store. They added them anyways. Checked my new account and saw those changes pending my next bill. I call T-Mobile support and they advised they took off those changes. End of first month, the changes are still there. Do not go to this store nor T-Mobile. I regretted it.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>Omg daniel and eric are the best! Eric sold me a phone and gave me a great deal for he is very knowledgeable at all the current promotions and does his job at making the customer feel very important , for he never rushed me and was still able to help other customers but still giving me his full attention also I give him an A+ at his ability to multi-task. Then afterwards I messed my phone up somehow by pressing something in the settings so I want in and daniel gave outstanding customer service by greeting me at the door and fixing my problem with phone he also knows how to do his job good and its excellent at what he does because after explaining the issue he was able to fix it and did it so fast then he explained to ne how the phone works and help me understand better so I font break it again .i was happy because this store is very clean and follows all safety procedures due to covid-19 and I felt very safe and thoughts the store did excellent in following all the rules to keep customers safe . there was another man there I read his name tag but his name is unique so I will not attempt to spell it but I think he might be the manger idk well I noticed that he did an excellent job too and I love it when you see staff members going above the call of duty to give excellent customer service skills to the people that walk through the door. I once went to another store that is in covina and wow that store needs some training because over there they are very rude and would rather stand around talking to their coworkers then to wait on a customer and that has happened on more than 1 occasion that I was treated like that because they never seem to answer any questions u may have and look like they don't even want to be there but now I will always drive the extra miles to go over to the san dimes store where I am greeted with a smile and a friendly welcome .san dimes store staff are well trained and know how to help customers out and seems like they like their job by going that extra step to make sure the customer leaves the store happy and they are very smart too I will be going back for TV subscription that they now offer after overhearing them tell another customer about it . thanks for all the help and for never getting upset with me since I'm not that tech savvy. I feel like they went above the expectations and exceeded at making me more tech savvy so I font mess up my phone again . awesome store and incredible staff here.<//text><userid>112003142728551134313<//userid><Name>Mindy Pedregon</Name><Rating>5</Rating>< response>

<Time>1603916175127<//Time><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>This was the WORST experience I have ever had at any wireless carrier let a lone TMOBILE. I went into the store to buy an Apple watch and the sales associate Harout was a complete and total disaster!!

First off for 3/4 of my transaction with Harout he was on the phone with who knows who(probably trying to fix another mistake he made earlier in the day) so was never ever really attentive my purchase. I informed Harout that was looking to purchase an apple watch for myself using a promo offer they have available. He told me they only had two colors black or gold. I told Harout I would like the gold.

Harout proceeded to process my order while on the phone with someone else. He processed my purchase without EVER explaining the new apple line i just opened or showing me the watch or even the box. I got to my car opened the box and immediately saw that the watch is a Rose Gold Color with a Plum band. ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT I WANTED.

I went back into the store to trade in the device assuming this would be simple and easy. This ordeal took over an hour, Harout offered to give me the bands. Off of his OWN apple watch, or split the $75 RESTOCKING FEE that i now have to pay in order to get an apple watch in the color I was sold on!!!!

Harout failed me at almost every possible point. The store manager HUETAN is evidently useless as well because Harout called him and “they could not do anything to help me”. I was told to come back tomorrow because the store manager would be in. I come in TODAY and im told the manager is off on Wed and Sun!!!!

Now I am stuck with an apple watch I did not want because the staff and management at this store is unable to complete even the simplest of customer service tasks.

DO BUSINESS WITH THIS LOCATION AT YOUR OWN RISK. Even if you get a competent worker the management is also decrepit so will be unable to help you any further.<//Review>< pictures>

Not very happy at this location, they wanted to charge me $65.00 to switch phones.  They said I had to activate the phone I wanted to switch to even though all I wanted to do is switch an existing phone to another.  Went to another location and they were able to help me switch phones and all they charged was the cost of the sim.</text>

I can honestly say this location has excellent communication with their staff, not to mention the staff by the way is superb! These folks really went out of their way in helping me upgrade my phone, it was a smooth transition and no hassle unlike other locations I've dealt with. I got into a new phone and everything was transferred from my old to the new contact and pictures. Thank you Ashley, Janessa and Sylvia, thank you for the professionalism and honesty!< /review><user_id>100962990196331067084</user_id>< gmapID>

Honestly had a fantastic experience. My wife and I came in to upgrade our phones and had  gotten help by Janessa. She was very informative and extremely helpful. We were able to work out a great deal that made sense. We came in with our kids and the store manager helped us make sure our son was occupied so we can take care of our phones. The team went above and beyond and was more than willing to work with us! Thank you Sprint of San Dimas!</Text>

Her employees are well versed in what they are doing and will admit to their faults when a mistake is made even if its on Sprint's customer service and not the sole responsibility of the store. Many people have issues with Sprint as a company as I do but, they forget that this is just a store that is operating to the best of its' ability. Any billing and account problems is on the companies end. The employees here definitely understand that and will apologize for the company and will aid you as best as possible.< /Review>< Pictures>

These guys were great to me. Because  I'm a electronically challenged individual, I had many many questions . I worked primarily with  Joey, he was always very helpful with all my concerns and was able to  solve all my problems . I'm not one to really make a lot of decisions based on reviews because  I think  a lot of time people are already irritated and they write reviews out of frustration.  What I will say is that they will work with you a lot better than  Verizon.  Great job!!!</text>

<text>If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  In November 2015, we went into this store to talk about our bill.  My husband was on the iPhone Forever lease program and while we were there - he was talked into upgrading his iPhone 6 for an iPhone 6s.  Since we were on the lease program and they told us it would be the same price we thought why not!  We turned in his iphone 6 and left with the 6s - awesome!

We were SO wrong! About 6 months later, I really looked at all the details of my bill where I found that they were charging us for 2 LEASES!  It is now October 2016 and I am STILL fighting with this store and corporate regarding this phone we returned almost a year ago! Still paying 2 leases, unable to upgrade my phone because it looks like I have a lease, and overpaid my bills for a year. They claim to have new employees at this store and can't help us for something old employees did.  Now we have 2 leases, only 1 phone - multiple hours on the phone and in store with them trying to get help!

Better Business Bureau is next on my list.  Sprint I am a long time customer but this store is GARBAGE.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>I am really disappointed in the customer service here. They were so rude to me and didnt even try to help me solve the problem. Previously a co worker of mine set up a line with them and bought the phone with no credit. I have pretty bad credit so i was looking for the same deal. After speaking to the employee for an over an hour, he refused to let us do the deal with no credit. My co worker told me that they just took a down payment from him and he was on his way. Its very unfortunate that they treat their customers this way. I am a paying customer and all i wanted to was get a new line. Will not be returning here.</Text><gmapID>0x80c32fae2e09a85f:0xd1f02704d1477cc0< /gmapID>< resp>

I once took my phone in to have it looked at an issue I was having with freezing.  I was told that it needed to be replaced after they tried to re install some features.  I declined and took it to Best Buy, where they had no problem fixing my issue and informed me that there was never an attempt to prior to fix problem.  They handed me my phone in a matter of minutes fixed and ready to go.  No charge. As opposed $ triple digits Sprint wanted to charge me. I caught them lying about the supposed attempt in trying to fix my phone.  No regard to making things right.  No apologies.  When contract is up....changing phone service.</Text>

Sprint is the worse... pay for insurance only to be told its the mother board and need to upgrade.

Days later I go back ... was told I have a $200 deductible. .. just upgrade! Was originally told I qualify for a discount - but the 2nd time around I had to bring it up. 10 years as a loyal customer...   at the end of the day, the insurance I've been  paying for - for  years  means nothing.  So disappointed.  Looking to switch ASAP!  I will never recommend Sprint ever!  Yelp is my next stop.< /Review>

So I was told I would be receiving a survey about the customer service here... I never did and I’m guessing because it’s my moms account. Well I upgraded my phone here and you guys were amazing. The wait wasn’t long and I was greeted right away. Kyle Renae and Daniel you guys rock srsly. One of you had said that the survey meant a lot to you so I hope this helps. I would recommend you three to everyone. It felt like I had known you guys forever with the friendlyness of this store. I didn’t know really anything about the new phone I wanted and had a lot of questions now because of you all I feel like IM the expert now haha well you guys rock keep doing what you’re doing. Killing it !!!</review>

<Review>I went to this branch about a month ago to get a change of ownership with my friend. The pregnant girl that helped us was very rude and wouldn't answer my questions. She asked us for $50 deposit to complete the change of ownership, come to find out the line is still in my name and she processed the $50 as a payment to my phone bill. So basically I was up there for two hours for no reason and have to go back and waste more of my time because this can't be done over the phone. I don't recommend this branch to anyone! I've never been so mistreated by a Sprint associate before. Usually they are real bubbly and eager to help. Not at this branch tho. Go to the one in west covina if you can</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c32fae2e09a85f:0xd1f02704d1477cc0</gmapID></record>

<Text>If you have an opportunity to go to a different store please save yourself the time and grief and DO NOT go to this store. They are incredibly rude and not helpful in the slightest. They withhold information and don't seem to have any genuine care for the customers at all. I wish I could cancel my line and go with another company but I do not want to pay all the fees that would entail. I have such a bad taste in my month from Sprint now. As soon as my contract is up and I going to look into other providers.< /Text><rate>1</rate><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

Disappointed with my experience here. Representatives are HORRIBLE at explaining how to go about getting something done. Not to mention their lack genuine care for customer service. Went in to complete a change of liability/ownership and pretty much wasted my time because no one was on the same page about how to go about it...and apparently the one person who was lacked the awareness that no one else knew and failed to provide courtesy and authentic apology for wasting a customers time and efforts. Instead, an attitude of "thats policy" was thrown in my face. Horrible way of dealing with frustrated customers Sylvia. I have no doubt you know policy but customer service is also recognizing where your customer is coming from and attempting to redeem yourselves from the mistakes that have already occurred.<//review>

<Text>I went to The Walk Shop to check out some cute shoes my dear manicurist had on when I was there for my bi-weekly pampering. I was welcomed by a very sweet woman, who was happy to show me the shoes I was interested in. I LOVE SHOES! I loved the shoes Phong wore, and ended up purchasing two pairs….burgundy and blue….joy! She remembered Phong and I left the shop very happy- with my shoes, the service and welcoming staff. If I see another pair(since I walk every day), I’ll be happy to return. Thank you Walk Shop!</Text>< name>

<text>OMG. I have neuropathy. He pain is intense. Along with that I get intermittent edema. I decided to go to the Walk Shop to get a wide  shoe to help with the pain. I do not regret it. I was tears after trying on a pair and have worn them for work ever since. Their selections are excellent. style, function cost are all worth noting. They are a little high in price but as they say "you get what you pay for". The staff are excellent as well.<//text>< pics>

The Walk Shop is staffed with a highly knowledgeable, patient, friendly, and exacting staff. You might pay a bit more than you would for a pair of shoes bought online, but the pair you walk out of the store with will be suited to your needs, the appropriate size, and be kind to your feet.
Worth every penny.<//text>

I called to order a pair of boots. A very kind person named Melissa assisted me. She explained everything and the boots will be delivered to the store where I can pick them up when its convenient.</review>

Review Walk Shop Walnut Square, Berkeley

My wife has been shopping there for about 30 years

She mentioned very high-quality European and American  Shoes

With an expertise  On the selection required for the individual

I requested something for ankles as I had Some swelling from working the peg  Shifting on my motorcycle

Alicia at the walk shop  Recommended four slip on shoes as I wanted to use them for work

She had me put on both shoes not one for the balance and checking room in the toe. As to sizing

I had always heard there is no pressure two Purchase  too purchased And suggested I keep my other option open And put the shoe on hold

Bottom line I compared the slip On shoes for easy access entering our 🏡 Home

Unlike one of my favorite stores. REI a co-op.  Walk  shop  shoes includes casual and dress shoes and very nice European models with leather heels Equally comfortable

My final choice ended up being a Merrill slip on 👞 shoe

Alicia Suggested this slip on specifically for ankle support

Bottom line  Suede shoe with very comfortable inserts More cushion on the inserts  Then the Salomon cross training shoes highest rating

Merrill had a preferable tread bottom as it has extra armor on the outside of the heels wear shoes were out first

The Merrill shoes have more support than the super feet inserts that both Merrill and REI sell

Summary a good looking Shoe very comfortable and safe tread pattern can be used in the  Wet soil or steep hillside not bad for $100. Considering just the insert would cost you $50

Location For the 👨‍🎓 Student or Berkeley patron who lives near the first Pete’s on Vine Street Walnut Square< /Text>

I'm always delighted when I buy my shoes here. Mickey and Melissa both remembered me from the last time, even though it was about six months ago. Mickey immediately found exactly the shoes I needed, and patiently helped me while I tried them out. Wonderful, friendly staff and excellent service, as well as a rich variety of shoes for all tastes and needs.</review>

<text>Best shoes for comfort & style. They are not cheap but I've found it's cheaper to buy regular-price Euro brands there than when I'm in Europe. Plus it's a longtime Berkeley biz & used to sponsor public radio so I also want to support them in return.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

This was a much better experience than a couple of the other snobby shoe stores that I visited that day.

I would definitely recommend this place, and I will likely be back when I need high-quality shoes again.</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>While this store does have more specialized a selection of comfort shoes with excellent customer service, I find the mark up to be quite high.  Found the same shoes at practically half the price online.  Sales rep was very knowledgeable so I can understand that service comes at a cost.  Great service and good quality products but watch out for that price tag.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>I purchased my first pair of Dansko’s from this retailer about a year ago. The lady helping me did a fantastic job of helping me find the right shoe with the perfect fit. A year later the shoes still fit perfectly and quickly became my favorite pair I’ve ever owned. Wonderful experience overall can’t wait to go back someday soon and get another pair!<//review>< pics>

Amazing selection made it very hard to choose which isn't the case in other shops and so very helpful.   This trip ended up with an extremely comfortable pair of Dansko sandals.</text>

I am on my feet many hours a day and went to the Walk Shop to get some professional advice. They did not disappoint. I told James my issue and he was blunt and set my expectations from the start. Yes, the shoes he recommended weren't the coolest or trendiest in the shop, but when I put those on my feet, the clouds parted and the sun started to shine for the first time in years!!

Of course I could have bought those shoes online or closer to home, but I could not have gotten the advice needed from you! Thank you Walk Shop. I will be coming back to you from now on.

Everyone is friendly, knowledgeable, and still consistent with having same employees. Awesome experience and the daily commercials advertising sail on Radio AM 740!
Highly recommended!

Hard to find a good sir & fit these days, this place carries quality brands & has a very nice, balanced feel to it.
The best part is the continued individualized service and seemingly tailored fit they can do with inserts, stretching, hole punching etc.
Sometimes gets overwhelmingly busy but still definitely worth it.<//Review>

They have a great staff who are always will to help and a decent selection. I have smaller feet so sometimes they have to search for the right size for me and they only really have boots out in the fall, which I guess is normal, but I like wearing my black ankle boots all year round!< /Text>

I wish there was a way to giver her more than 5 stars!! Dr.McMurray is the best kind of doctor: incredibly knowledgeable and wise with years of experience behind her, the kindest woman you will ever meet, attentive to small details, and the most empathetic and calming person as well. I could go on and on about how amazing she is!! Having a doctor that cares about you as a person and not just her patient is something that is truly rare in the medical field and absolutely priceless!!! I have the highest respect and trust for her and recommend her to all of the women in my life!!</text>

<Review>Dr. McMurray is a consummate medical professional, and is surpassed by none in her field. She is extremely knowledgeable and completely dedicated to finding the root cause of an issue. I've been her patient since she began her practice, along with the fact that she has delivered six of my grandchildren! Through girlie-girl stuff and surgeries, she is the Top Doc!!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAOS7uidDpkO44YNYmd8QUvjwz7LELCjhlyI4x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

I’m so thankful that I became a patient of Dr. McMurray’s over 20 years ago! She is an incredible doctor, always providing her patients with the utmost care, attention and loving heart! She truly cares about her patients and always has a listening ear! Debbie, her nurse has always been fantastic too for all of these years! This practice is the best!</text>

Dr. McMurray is so amazing that when she left the exam room I did a little celebratory dance. She is knowledgeable, easy to talk to, and makes you feel important and heard. I’m so incredibly happy to have found her.< /review>

Love Dr McMurray.  She never makes me feel rushed, goes over everything with me in detail and takes her time to answer any questions and gives a very thorough exam. I recommend Dr. Mcmurray to anyone looking for a fabulous gynecologist< /review>

I drive an hour to see Dr. McMurray, she's the best at what she does.  20 years ago I saw her as my OBGYN and now she helps with bio-identical hormones.  In ONE visit my night sweats and hot flashes have disappeared.  There is no reason women have to live with that. She is not only a great Dr. she is also a really great person.</text>

Dr Mac is the BEST Dr I’ve ever had. She knows everything about everything (seriously, she’s “that” smart!) and helps to calm your fears and or educate you, in every situation that may come up throughout life!
I’m so grateful to have found her and made her my go to, for almost every situation I need with my health!
Thanks 😊 Dr. McMurray, you and Debbie (her right arm!) have helped me countless times and I’m grateful!< /text>

I have been going to Dr. McMurray for 25 years and although she's not covered under my insurance policy, I refuse to go to someone else.  You cannot put a price tag on the top quality care she gives to each of her patients.  She treats you as if you're her only patient and is very proactive.  I like how she always has me thinking and planning ahead.<//text>

I am extremely impressed with my first visit with Dr. McMurray and her nurse Debbie.   I appreciate the personal attention and thorough evaluation of my hormonal needs that encouraged my decision to move forward with the regimen suggested. I am hopeful for positive results and look forward to a continued doctor-patient relationship in the future.  Thankyou.<//Text>

She is so caring and helpful with all my health issues.  I trust her explicitly.
I will always pass my health concerns by her to advise me the best route to take. Please never retire!!<//text>

We got to listen to music, I held my daughter right away, and I even used a mirror so I could see her being delivered. It was a great experience, even with it turning out differently than I wanted.< /Text>< Pics>

Dr. McMurray has been my doctor for many years.  A year ago she discovered that I had uterine cancer and made an appt. with a dr. that would perform the surgery.  Dr. McMurray assisted in the surgery and even held my hand as I was rolled into the operating room.  She has always been kind, helpful and up to date on all issues related to gynecologist issues.

Thank you Dr. McMurray<//text>

I love Dr. McMurray's upbeat attitude and that she looks at you as a whole person.  While having a wellness exam she noticed that my toenail has fungus on it.  She recommended a daily regimen for the fungus and also ordered me the medication.  She is thorough and will discuss any questions you may have.  She is very open and positive.< /review>

I have been a patient of Dr. McMurray for the last 13 yrs and I highly recommend her! I recently moved to Austin, TX and saw her last week for my annual pap while I was in town visiting. She's worth the out of pocket cost!< /Review>

I have been going to this practice since I was 14, I am now 34. I started seeing Dr. McMurray when we became pregnant with our first as we needed an OBGYN, but didn’t want to leave this practice. Dr. McMurray delivered both our girls and has helped me with so much! I am so comfortable with her and trust everything she says and does. We absolutely love the staff, office, and doctor of course. Now we are trying for our 3rd and I wouldn’t want to see or trust another doctor. Thank you! 😁</text>

<review>This visit was my first time seeing this doctor.
I felt very comfortable with my introduction to her. She reviewed all important information and did the basic internal checks.
I was very comforted by her attention to details of my medical history (that had been overlooked)  for which she suggested some blood work.
I felt the doctor was thorough and pleasant to deal with. I look forward to having her as my gynecologist going forward.< /review>< Pictures>

Dr. Karie McMurray is superb with detail. Very Knowledgeable in her field of expertise with an excellent bed side manner! I have always experienced helpful, accommodating nurses and office staff.
She truly cares whole heartedly for the wellness of her patients! What more could a woman ever need in an OBGYN but thank you! You are so appreciated and loved Dr. McMurray for your dedication! That’s human kindness at it’s best!<//review>

She is respectful of all whom she has dealings with, she listens carefully, and extends her personal care to each patient.
All of her patients whom I’ve had contact with, love her, and she is appreciated and respected by her peers.
Really, I can’t say enough good about her!

<review>Dr, McMurray takes the time to talk to you and she really listens! I have been a patient of hers for over 30 years! Though I am never a fan of going to the doctor,; she is like going to see a friend for advise. I would highly recommend Dr. McMurray!<//review>< Response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>My doctor retired abruptly and my search for a new doctor led me to Dr. McMurray.  Being a new patient resulted in a wait time, but because of her fantastic reviews, and being highly recommended on Nextdoor.com, I decided it was worth the wait.   I wish I found her years ago!   If you are looking for a doctor that listens to you, is thorough, attentive and has your best interest, see Karie McMurray!</text>< pics>

<review>I have been a patient at Dr. McMurray's office for over 30 years.  She is the most compassionate, caring physician I have ever experienced.  She is down to earth in her conversations with you....it's like talking to your sister.  She's conservative, yet aggressive when needed.  I feel very lucky to have her in my physician base.  I highly recommend her practice.< /review>< pictures>

<review>I love Dr. McMurray and her entire staff.  I've been a patient of Conejo Women's Medical Center for almost 25 years and have always been very happy with the care I've received there.  Dr. McMurray is a delight and her staff always makes me feel comfortable.

I just had a visit with Dr. McMurray and as usual, I am so happy to see her and her staff.  We are so lucky to have this fine physician in Thousand Oaks.  I really like her nurse as well.  Best group ever!!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< user_name>

I see her for gynecologic care, but she monitors my overall health too. She and her staff are respectful, never condescending, seeking my input on decisions regarding care.  My only quibble is that waiting room times can be long, but when it's my turn, Dr. McMurray gives me her full attention to be sure that all my questions are answered.< /text>< Pictures>

Always a great experience. Very nice office staff. Dr. McMurray is the best. She is kind, caring, straight forward and up to date on all the current medical care for women, and she listens. I have never felt more comfortable with a doctor. She has helped me through a lot of tough medical issues. I wouldn't go to anyone else.< /review>

Comfy waiting room and  professional yet friendly staff. I was called in right on time for my 10:30 am appointment, my info checked and vitals taken. However, due to a shortage of available rooms, it was 45 minutes before I saw Dr. McMurray.
Dr McMurray is knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. I have the utmost confidence in her care and recommend her highly. My one complaint would be that one and a half hours (I left the office at 12:00) is inconvenient and un-necessary.<//Text>

<date>1581570596556</date><rate>1< /rate><review>I took my girlfriend on her birthday to Jovani in LA and instead of leaving happy with a new dress, we left with no dress and super disappointed with the experience we had there.

We drove from SD to LA for about 2 hour which is not a short drive but it was all to make her happy with a new Jovani Dress on her birthday. When we finally got there and went inside it was super quiet with no music at all as if I was visiting a library.
I was at least expecting a more live feeling when you are in a clothing store, especially when you are visiting a store like Jovani which is not a cheap place.
I was hoping that the staff at the store would be more helpful and willing to find the perfect dress that my girlfriend was looking for.
Instead the staff acted as if I am buying groceries in Ralphs which I might add has far better customer service than the one we got today at Jovani.
When we were looking at the dresses they all looked as if they were used and unorganized which made it even more difficult to pick from and find the right size.

Even if I over look the fact that dresses weren't organized, or that the store was super quiet without any music to make it more fun picking a dress for my girlfriend.
If only the staff was at least acting as if they wanted to help find the dress we were looking for or would say thank you for coming when we left would have made our experience not that disappointing.

I understand that a place like Jovani is very famous, but it should still provide a high quality customer service that would make the customer want to continue coming back and recommending this place to friends and family, not the other way around.

Lastly, I will just say that it was the first and last time that I visit that store and I will not be recommending it to anyone else.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Amazing experience. Just looking for some dressed to wear for a wedding I'm attending soon. I came in with yoga pants and a t-shirt with no makeup and we still got fabulous service. Candice was super helpful with finding us the right dress, giving advice, and everything in between. We will definitely be back in the future.< /Review>

The staff at Jovani LA is always super helpful and works with your budget. You’re able to buy gowns on the spot, order them and even expedite a delivery if you’re crunched for time. The store is incredibly clean, even has a bathroom and is located in a part of town with decent street parking. Highly recommend this company, location and staff for your JOVANI gown needs.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Jovani gowns are phenomenal!  They are created with exquisite fabrics and make you look and feel like a million bucks. Perfect for semi formal events, to parents, proms, and weddings; as well as anything in between.  They offer all styles and fits with a wide range of pricing options!  I totally recommend Jovani !!< /Review>

<Text>I looked for dresses all the way from Finland where we live, and found the most perfect weddingdress from Jovani, and couldn’t be happier. The service was great, we got help from Lina. I got the dress right on time, and was really happy about the quality when wearing it at the wedding. ❤️<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I Went to this store looking for a prom dress and I was extremely dissatisfied when I walked in and didn't even receive any acknowledgement from the staff. If I walk in its because I'm looking to give you my service and as someone who works in customer service the least you can do is give a warm greeting. It seemed to me the staff were raised by wolves because of their appalling lack of manners . despite this I decided to look around anyway and found myself underwhelmed by the atmosphere and display of the dresses. The trip to this place was a complete waste of time. It absolutely doesn't seem like the kind of store that deserves such a good location. I advise anyone who wants a good dress and enjoyable experience to take their business elsewhere.<//Review>

This location gave my information to someone who then called me and claimed that my online payment did not go through, they said they needed my card information (number and cvv) but yet they couldn't repeat my order for me to reassure me that it was in fact Pizza hut calling me. I cancelled my card just to be safe. Dont feel safe ordering from them ever again.< /Text>

<review>Oh man, the double peporoni pizza was ridiculously good. I've usually only eaten dominoes and papa johns in the past and thought I'd go out of my comfort zone and try our pizza hut. Glad I tried it out. I can say its better than both. This is my new favorite pizza franchise, hands down!<//review>< pics>

<Text>Terrible customer service. Walked from my apartment to order a carry out pizza, and was told it would only take 15 minutes for it to be made. Sat down to wait. After 45 minutes, my pizza was not ready. (3x the amount of time I was quoted). No explanation or apology was given. I would have understood if they had even said they were really behind or something, but no one even said anything to us. When we finally got our pizza a few minutes later, we walked back with it. After walking all the way back,  we found out our sauces were the incorrect flavor. (The cheddar cheese one is disgusting by the way).</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

If I could give no stars i would!!!! Not just did my pizza arrive is horrible conditions but to top it off, customer service is a the worst!! Maria if that is her real name has a horrible attitude and denied me the manager saying "she don't have time for you right now" and when I said I didn't want another pizza but a refund she said "its not what you want its what the manager wants" (patricia "manager) luckily the headquarters didn't think like them and they have file a report against this location and its not about the money (which they will refund) but the customer service this location provides! I hope the headquarters does bring it to there attention not only by words but with actions!</text>

takes at least 40 minutes to receive pizza, ordered two pizzas one was missing an ordered topping, and my bag of parmesan and chili flakes only had one crumbled napkin for four people.

The pizza should not have been 20. We asked for three toppings and when we received the pizza it look like it was only little bit of toppings green peppers and a few pepperoni and sausage it should have not been 20.< /review>

I placed an order and I never got it. I call the store but all they would do is hang up my calls. Horrible service.</review>

About once a year I make a trek from Southern California up to Portland and the Oregon coast, or the Trinity Amps. This is always my nightly stop-over and I have my favorite spot as well. I've been here a few times, and look forward to being back in just a couple weeks. It's convenient (right off I5), the scenery is beautiful, and since it only has a few sites it is pretty quiet and spacious. Love this spot!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This campground  is prefect if you are needing a camp right off the I-5 very convenient. Clean and beautiful  scenery  on the road to the camp and beyond to the caverns . They only have 7 sites which is nice for the not many people angle<//text>

Baileys Cove state park is hard for me to rate on the single 5 star system.
As a small 7 space camping park with a attached day use area. Its really nice!
The current (3-13-2021) camp host, Brian had the park looking good. No trash to be seen and the bathrooms were clean.
I would have to give a small deduction for being located under a portion of 1-5. So naturally, you do hear some heavy truck traffic while around the camp fire / picnic area. This may bother some light sleepers or those in tents.
At only $25 a night (3-13-21). It's a great place to camp for someone traveling 1-5...

The negative is that unfortunately, Baileys Cove as a WATER recreation area is impossible. The fact of the matter is, do to a variety of reasons. The Cove is bone DRY in mid March. My attached photos can far better put it into perspective, then my words...
With NO snow pack to speak of when I visited / went by the Mt. Shasta area. I don't see or know now Mt. Shasta lake can refill up enough water, to once again restore Bailey's Cove as a water recreation area any time soon. Pretty sad...<//Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>Get spot 1 if you can...it's furthest from the highway. Really, if you're at the other ones, you're directly under the highway and it's loud. Better for van or small RV camping, so you can have some sound barrier. Only flush toilets, no soap or paper towels. Ok for a short one night stop over but wouldn't want to spend any more time there.< /text>< pics>

<review>Easy, clean campsite off of HWY 5 in Shasta. $23 (cash only) for a single campsite with picnic table and fire ring. Only downside is it is close to the HWY and you can hear cars and trucks all night. Other than that it was great, would definitely go back.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Amazing spot! I highly recommend this campground. What a terrific time. The sites vary in amenities so you can choose your own level of 'roughing it'. The lake is pretty sweet. I was able to wade into the refreshing water easily. The access was a short easy walk. The water clarity was about 5 feet so pretty clean. Very nice place.<//Text><rate>5< /rate>< UserId.>

Wasn’t the best place, too close to the freeway so at night you constantly hear big rigs and horns at times. None of the camp grounds were close to water but overall was alright.<//review>

This place was filthy. I blame this on the guests, but still. Trash cans were overflowing, toilet paper and litter around the campsites, no toilet paper in the bathroom. General yuck. The place itself is pretty and freeway close, but it needs some care from both the people who run the place and the visitors who use the place.< /Text>

Came here to camp for one night in late July. While this campground is right by Shasta Lake, there really isn't much water to speak of this time of the year. Mind you, it is deep enough to swim in, but dont expect a very ample lake in Summer.

The campgrounds themselves are quite nice - nicely laid out, and many of them feel quite private and spacious. The very first one does offer a bit of a lake view, although you'll be right by the entrance and, as I mentioned, there isn't that much of a lake. Do note that you are fairly close to the highway, but the noise isn't overly loud.

Come night time, there are bugs galore - putting aside the mosquitoes, there are swarms of these tiny little bugs that aren't warded off by citranella candles, and there was this one class of beetle that literally would dive bomb my table in a dazed and drunken state - entertaining, but annoying.

Finally, in July in more or less central California, it's hot as heck, so expect that.

However, I'm being a little petty - it was a nice campground, and I'd probably recommend this place in the early springtime when the water levels would be higher and temperatures lower. Cost when I went was $20 per night. There is drinking water, but you have to bring your own firewood.< /text>

Nice little campground.  Kind of private but not secluded.  4 stars since highway was just behind the trees. Kind of ruined the ambiance.
#7 has spots for a whopping 3 tents! 2 large picnic tables, and a fire ring. Sadly, not by lake..although water and marina was just a short distance

NO SHOWERS! Which was bad for tent campers like us. I didn't find any public showers at all in the entire Shasta lake.< /review>

A great place to camp if you enjoy listening to trucks all night. Also, the cove is a brown hole in late July.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very nice but there are people who don't know what these places are for
It was 8:30 p.m.
And my children and I were doing activity smiling and the neighbors next to us complained and measured that there was a lot of buña and that they were trying to sleep
Those places are for fun to have a good time and fall asleep type 11pm
And don't let one fun

(Original)
Muy lindo pero hay gente que no sabe para que son estos lugares
Eran las 8 30pm
Y mis hijos y yo estábamos haciéndo actividad sonriendo y los vecinos que teníamos a lado se quejaron y medijeron que avía mucha buña y que ellos estaban tratando de dormir
Esos lugares son para divertirse  pasar la bien y dormirse tipo 11pm
Y no arinuarles a la diversión a uno</Review></record>

Not a ton of stuff on tap, but it rotates frequently enough and they've always got something good.

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>Great food!!  Fish and chips was succulent.  Sausage sandwich was savory.  Fresh pretzels super yummy.  Tater tots crispy and hot... extensive beer and wine selection.  I shall return.  Wait for food was a bit long, but worth the wait as quality was high.  Patio chairs are hard, no cushions, bring your own to be comfortable for a longer sit.  Great music.  u2, Marley.  Friendly patient staff.

Returned on June 7 at 2:40 pm. Waitress/hostess seated me.  I asked to sit at bar and she said that is ok.  I was ignored by bartender and man with tavern at vogue T-shirt who drank at the bar and who seemed to be in a position of leadership.

They don’t seem to be eager to help their customers here.  So sad that an operation with a good product being run into the ground with poor customer service.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< UserId.>

<text>Great service, awesome selection of brews, and tasty food menu. Highly recommend the sharable plates for two or three people. My friend and I split a pretzel, it was fresh and warm. For my beer I opted for a fresh German lager. 10 out of 10 will visit again. Prost!< /text>< GmapID>

We decided to try this place out since they had a family meal deal. $25 for 4 burgers and 2 orders of fries. My family is big, so we ordered chicken strips for the little ones. I must say... this place is a hidden gem for sure! The burger was amazing and the meat was seasoned nicely.  Fries were on the softer side. But we actually prefer fries like that. Whenever we go out we always have fries left over. This time the littles ate all the fries. The chicken was good too. Nice crisp. I can't wait to go back (during non lock down times) so we can have the food and a cold beer!<//text>

The large pretzel starter is great with any of the cold local beers on tap. It's good with the entire variety of course,  but supporting local brewers makes it taste better. Steins available too for quenching your thirst.  Ordered the bison burger, one of the best I've ever had.  When bingo started, the host passed out cards and blotters to the people who were interested in playing, mostly reservations. Believe it or not,   I won the first 2 bingo games of the night! My prizes were a free beer on my next visit, which I'm sure will be another memorable experience. Great location next to the old Vogue theatre, featuring  a variety of outdoor seating. Family friendly.  There's clearly a reason this place stays busy, and I look forward to my next visit.

Highly recommended.<//review>

Chula Vista locals and my wife and I are so happy to see this Wonderfully renovated Tavern. Very open dining rooms and the bar was extremely comfortable. The staff was very attentive and helpful with beer selections. Haven't tried the food choices yet...next time for sure.< /Text>

Food was tasty. Small portions, though. Bonus for huge mugs, lost 1 star for serving beer in plastic cups. I will give it another try but it's the owners job to stand firm against absurdity.<//review>

This wasn’t my first time here, but it was the first time this year. The food was great! I ordered the Tavern Burger and the small pretzel. The burger was juicy and well put together. I’ve had the wings and the Bratwurst in the past and they were amazing too. The customer service is always great. Today Alan was my server and he was helpful and courteous. The seating arrangement is spaced out and organized to accommodate the 6 foot social distancing.  I can’t wait to come back and try some dessert, when it is added to the menu. Thanks for the great meal!< /text>

Nice joint!  Their pretzel alone is worth a visit for but their beer selection is also wonderful.  It’s unique and you’re able to do tasters before you commit to a pint or stein (huge mug!).  Unfortunately sidewalk traffic walks right through some of the outdoor seating but is not a big deal.  Staff did a great job serving and making sure we had everything we needed in a timely manner.< /text>

<Text>Great service, awesome selection of brews, and tasty food menu. Highly recommend the sharable plates for two or three people. My friend and I split a pretzel, it was fresh and warm. For my beer I opted for a fresh German lager. 10 out of 10 will visit again. Prost!< /Text>< time>

Did not like their food menu at all, Nothing healthy about it. I had 3 or 4 beers and it was over priced, $44.00. Tater tots not even good, no toppings either. I couldn't even finish them. It's unfortunate but I will be spending my wealth somewhere else.< /Text>

<Review>I love their food. Fresh baked Bavarian pretzels, sausages, wedge salads, schintzlels...so many delicious choices. Beer choices are....ummm...okay. No blow your Sox off like at 3rd Ave Ale House but if you include their can choices, not bad. I really just come here for the food.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Was a great time with a great server, sitting outside of course due to Covid. My only real complaint is that for a bar that is open until 11pm, why did they completely close at 10pm including closing our tab? 3 of us with a $150 tab and you closed us out early??? Horrible with 6 other bars and breweries open within 1/4 mile.<//Text>< date>

Extremely disappointing food came out ice cold Don't know if it was the fault of the waitress or the fault of the cook The waitress didn't seem interested in helping us seemed more concerned about the customer's outside and not the ones on the inside
Food is overpriced for what you get
They don't even have sauerkraut and they are a semi-german-based bar one of those specials comes with pickled carrots and pickles how does that even make sense I tried one of them It was disgusting like they just made it that morning and it didn't have a chance to marinate tasted awful and did not go with the bratwurst and pretzel at all completely throws off the taste of the plate You need to have sauerkraut with it
This place is a complete embarrassment to anybody that likes German food I would definitely never go back and definitely discourage anybody from coming here you'll be greatly disappointed
Hopefully with people being honest they can improve
With time but I definitely would never go back< /review>

Paid $21 for the "Sausage Platter".   3 sausages and a hot dog with some toasted bread.  Huh?  Should've stayed for some beer so that didn't hurt as much.</Text>

The bartender Amanda was fantastic!!!! She made me a strawberry smash (sake Rosemary and strawberry juice) which was so delicious. And, the wings (although a bit pricey) were second to none!!!
This place is fairly new but definitely worth checking out. Kids are welcome  and they have a mini arcade in the back area. Super cool!</text>

The buffalo burger is scrumptious! We enjoyed the beers and cocktails (forgot the bartender’s name but longish blondish hair up on head, glasses). But what was so overwhelmingly not so great was the unfinished looking place and disgusting restroom. It feels like a place in transition. Maybe things will look better in time - good like the food!</Text>

<text>This place is great! Q, the owner and our bartender for the night was great. The sausage sampler plate was amazing. They had Star Wars displays which was swick. Definitely recommend 10 stars out of five!</text>< Time>

Honestly everything on the menu is amazing. I can tell they put a lot of work and thought into each item on the menu. Between their burger and the Schnitzel, I can't decide which is my favorite. Or a simple pretzel and sausage will hit the spot. It's definitely a comfortable atmosphere, with classic arcade games and good music, yet with just the right amount of lighting. AND i can't forget it's family friendly. Great beer selection, and in my opinion the Bombardier english ale pairs well with everything on the menu.< /text>

New little German style tavern next to the old Vogue Theatre. This place is casual with plenty of seating. Few seats at the bar. Only one large screen TV at bar area playing 80's MTV videos. I love this era of music so cool with me. 👌 Staff is friendly and helpful. I had a bratwurst sandwich with veggies. Good bar food which is perfect for this place. They even have a game room with two arcade tables. Add a couple more TV's and it will boost ambience. Check it out.<//Review>

Meat in tube form and delicious beer,  which comes in tankards the weight of a Volkswagen.   Great music videos played from a time when music was good.   I am 49 and thoroughly enjoyed myself.<//review>

I loved this place, nice vibe, something different in 3rd ave. If you dont want beer and want to stay in Chula Vista this is the place to go! Pretzels are so good!< /text>

The "Tavern Board" is a great dish for two. Food was delicious . Especially enjoyed the bratwurst and pretzels. Had a pint (or two) of Bombadier, an English style pub ale. Definitely recommended.</text>

Their sandwiches are quite huge to be able to inhale standing. Sometimes, you don't have a place to take them too, and you just want to eat!

I am so addicted to their dutch crunch I never want a sandwich on any other bread- they sell their rolls for $5 for a bag of 6 and I actually use them when I make sandwiches at home. I’m not vegan, but they have the best vegan chicken I’ve ever had and I get it all the the time. I have been ordering a lot lately because they have been having $7 or $8 sandwich deals that I can’t miss. Please give this place a try instead of going to Subway or McCalister’s, you will not regret it.</text>< Response>

Ike's makes legendary sandwiches. They have an incredible amount of options, and everything is great. Not the healthiest option, but well worth it. And the best part: a Carmel apple lollipop with every sandwich!<//text>

Just recently found out they have vegetarian and vegan sandwiches and I've been going frequently to try them all. Hit or miss service. Sally ride is my fave, can't go wrong with vegan turkey. Ask for veg meat well done. Can pass on the fried zucchini coins, there's very little zucchini and lots of breading.</text>

My first visit to Ike’s. Service was fine and the menu is huge..... All the sandwiches are served hot but ours were cold by the time we broke into them at Pt Lobos. Recommend eating them hot because the meat is just not as tasty cold - microwaved some later and confirmed much better hot...... A bit pricey for what you get but given the variety I can why the chain is popular now.<//Text>

Great when it's great, but can't seem to get "no lettuce no tomato" right, even on a *meatball sub*. Since everything is take-out, and there's no receipt on the bag, I have no clue until I get home. That sucks and I'm tired of ending up with a bad sandwich. Y'all are batting 50% on my last four sandwiches.<//Text>

There is nothing like a Ike's sandwich after a stressful day, but to get two caramel apple lollies in the bag as a surprise? that's something to write home about.

Going to a concert at Mission Santa Clara, I was looking for a good place for some dinner. We live in Gilroy and are not familiar with this area but the pictures of the sandwiches looked good! Parking was definitely a challenge, but didn't take too long. There were SO many selections and different sandwiches, they listed probably 30-40 sandwiches (about 1/3 vegetarian and also listed chicken as halal). They prepared our sandwiches very quickly and the sandwiches were delicious, absolutely a place I would go to again. The restaurant had a very pleasant atmosphere and they gave us lollipops for dessert!<//Text>

Usually I really enjoy eating here, today not the same story. Basically I felt like I paid for sauce bread. Pretty disappointed especially I chose this place for Mother’s Day dinner! :(< /Review>

The sandwich was awesome...
I ordered the Kerri Walsh/#25. The bread was really fresh and I appreciat the sandwich maker warming the meat. This was my first time at Ike's but not my last. The only critical thing I would say is that they are a little skimpy on the bacon and it was a little pricey for a sandwich. Other than that it was all good.< /review>

I was told I needed to go there and try the Dutch Crunch bread when I was visiting a friend in San Jose.   I was not disappointed.  The bread is really good.  The menu is huge too.   I settled on a sandwich and enjoyed a nice lunch.  The only regret was I was looking for some ice tea (fresh brew), but there was none.  This was a small store so i am not surprised.   It would be a good idea to split one of the sandwiches as they are large.    Overall a good experience.<//Review>

Limited parking around the area but it's also walking distance from places with parking so it balances out!
Thank you! :)</review>< pictures>

Love the cleverly named sandwiches here.  They are on the pricey side.  My favorite is the Steve Nash (#10) It is  a delicious blend of halal chicken marinara and provolone on dutch crunch bread.  Don't particularly like the atmosphere here, and parking can be challenging, but the do make a delicious sandwich.</Review>

Like all Ikes locations, the sandwiches are funky, delicious, and consistent. Parking can be a bit hit or miss given the residential area, but they also offer delivery and pickup options which make it a bit easier during the lunch rush hour.<//Review>

Wow, we are blown away by the customer service and friendliness of the team of this place. From the moment we ordered to the moment we took our last bites, the team was friendly, helpful, and considerate. Their knowledge of the menu items and price points helped me feel comfortable making a decision. We will definitely be returning customers to this location.< /review>

Vegans: order your sandwich vegan and double check to ensure they put vegan spread (you have to ask) and vegan cheese if you want it. Dutch crust bread is not veg but sourdough is, and maybe others. Delicious overindulgence that requires a food coma afterwards.< /Text>

Ike's has a huge list of hearty sandwiches to choose from, it can be a tough decision. The sandwiches are pricey, but in my opinion, well worth it since it's enough for two meals (for me). Staff was friendly and food was great. Definitely would return.< /Review>

Ike's is pretty good but sometimes the sandwiches can be a little disappointing. They have messed my order up a couple times and that had been a bummer. Usually, the sandwiches are great and exactly what you want. If you're craving a good sandwiche, I'm sure Ike's has one that you're gonna love.<//review>

<Review>Great food, staff aren't the friendliest but aren't bad. Atmosphere sucks. Very few seats. Men’s restroom has not had a lock on it for at least two years... and it’s only made for one person.  How lazy is this owner/manager?<//Review>< pics>

Amazing sandwich - Larisa O.  I couldn't figure out exactly what made it so good.  Just the combination of everything.

I will say that the Dutch crunch roll was really good.  I've always hated that because what I've had in the past was beyond crunchy and was painful to chew.  Not this one.  Tasty, warm, and just a little bit of crunch.

I really like sandwiches, and this place has replaced Togo's for me.  I just hope that there's one close to me.< /review><time>1513561081313</time><rating>5<//rating></record>

Ike's has great sandwiches for all tastes and dietary requirements. I usually don't go for fake meat, but this place has some great options. They have a variety of meat, vegetarian and vegan options with multiple bread choices. Their dutch crunch is my favorite. Sandwiches are quite big and very filling. This location is close to Santa Clara University and usually has a lot of students hanging out here. Service is quick, staff friendly and sandwiches are consistently good. Our go to place to pick up a sandwich for a long hike.< /review>

This is the my favorite ikes! Hands down. The other ikes tend to mess up my orders or take forever. This one for some reason always gets my sandwich right and in a timely manner. The staff is nice and the area around there is fun to be in.
I get the Adam Richmond on dutch crunch.</Review>

Thick and juicy sandwiches with yummy ingredients. Ask for light/no dirty sauce if you're not a fan of mayo-type sauces. Have a great selection of veggie/vegan sandwiches too, as well as gluten free bread! Probably not recommended if you're afraid of getting your fingers covered in deliciousness though :)</review>

<username>Sonin Xo</username><Review>I love Ike’s as a vegan it gives me amazing options! Was highly disappointed when I couldn’t even eat my lunch I ordered through the app it was to pick up at 12:45 I went in at 12:50 and they hadn’t even started my order they had no idea about it. Next I asked for no dirty sauce add cucumbers and mustard. I got no mustard and no cucumbers ?!? My sandwhich was also completely drenched in teriyaki sauce so by the time I got to eat it was soggy. Really upset I spent my lunch here and got to eat nothing</Review><userid>109140449550818724680< /userid>< pictures>

The seating is a little off here.  They don't have a ton of space which makes it awkward to eat there.  However, Ike's sandwiches are pretty easy to take to go, so it's not a huge issue.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808fcb08334f885b:0x6aa2d341d28e0262<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>If you haven't been to Ike's Lair then you need to be here and try it. They have 100's of sandwiches that they have on their website. My favorite is the Kryptonite. Its a $20 sandwich but will feed 2 people. There is about 6 different meats in there. Loads of sauces, cheese sticks, avocado, and onion rings. The Matt Cain is awesome as well. I believe there's roast beef, godfather sauce and lettuce. Very simple but delicious.< /text>< time>

Holy moly, can their sandwiches get any better?! I’ve been to many Ike’s sandwich shops around California and their consistency on making delicious sandwiches are like the grades of the smartest kid in class, all A’s. Every sandwich is like another journey ready to be embarked.< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Annoying that they added a $0.75 surcharge to every order without telling you or seeing any obvious signage. It's only $0.75 but the principle matters to me. I asked the manager and he gave me some spiel about higher rents. That's fine, but don't just sneak it in there. He also said next time I can request to not be charged the fee... so it's optional apparently.< /review>< pics>

The sandwiches themselves are fantastic and the "dirty sauce" they add only makes them that much better. I definitely want to go back so I can try as many different sandwiches as I can, hopefully at some of their different locations as well.< /text>

<review>Although a bit pricey, words can not describe the quality of the sandwiches;
in taste and in the raw materials.
There's an abundant selection of sandwiches, to suit everyones taste.
I don't give Five start ratings lightly, however this was the best sandwich I've ever had!</review>< Pictures>

Some of the best sandwiches around, my favorite is the Patrick Marleu. It can be extremely busy most of the day and parking is limited as is seating. Recommend you use their app to order online and and take it to go.<//text>

Hands down my favorite sandwich shop. LOTS of vegan and vegetarian options, super fresh ingredients, tons of options/add-ons, and dutch crunch bread to die for. A little pricey, but sandwich size is enormous. Love the "Steve Jobs" with added jalapeños!< /text>

Been going here for years and always loved it. However I'm giving it 4 stars for two reasons: they don't recycle their glass bottles like they used to, and now they charge an extra 75 cents on every order "in support of minimum wage & benefits increases". You'd think a company with so many locations, making enough profit from sooo many sales would be able to pay their workers more without passing the cost to the customers. They do say the charge is voluntary but c'mon, really? I would have expected much more from a chain like Ike's!<//Review>

The Thanksgiving/Pilgrim sandwich is awesome. I love the sriracha sauce that gets mixed in with the combination of the cranberry sauce. It becomes very saucy/juicy.< /Text>

<response>None</response><review>Small place that we just happened to stumble upon when searching for lunch. Boy, did we luck out. This place was amazing - the decor, the staff, the FOOD; everything was top notch. I got the sandwich with fried chicken and buffalo sauce, which did not disappoint. The menu was huge (just like their sandwiches), and I foolishly didn't even read the bottom part of the menu that explained the different types of bread and additional toppings. I got the SF sourdough, and I really liked it - the Dutch Crunch seemed really good too from my friends' sandwiches. I'll definitely be going back and trying out different sandwiches. This place reminded me of the Rutgers Grease Trucks' Fat Sandwiches back in NJ.< /review>< Rating>

This place never disappoints. I live in Orange county and I've been here twice and it is soooo good.  I got the We're Just Friends sandwich with Dutch crunch. Definitely get the Dutch crunch. My boyfriend lives his cheese steak with rib eye. Try it out. It's on the expensive side for sandwiches but worth it.<//Text>

Best in the West! "Handsome owl" or "Sometimes I'm a vegetarian" are good choices. I always ask for extra sorry sauce on the side. To for die for.< /Review>

Generous sandwiches! These will get me full and leave me with leftovers

It is pricey which is interesting especially since its next to a college campus where you'd expect it to be a little more cheap

Anyways there is usually a wait so if you're in a hurry just do yourself a favor and order ahead so all you have to do is pick it up< /Review>

Great quirky sandwich shop.  Large selection of meat and non-meat sandwiches.  Most orders are toasted.  Beats Subway and Togos hands down.<//text>

Great sandwiches and fun atmosphere. Sandwiches are a little more expensive then you'd expect if it's your first time here but! After you've had one totally worth it. Parking is a little hard to come by so be warned.</Review>

<Review>Surprise surcharge. The blame is on minimum wage and claims to be for the employees. If that's so, make it a gratuity. Very shady way to avoid raising prices. Just update your menu. Don't blind side your patrons with surprise fees.<//Review><Time>1524861396535</Time><userid>107579740252667240554</userid></record>

I'm not really a huge sandwich girl, but damnnn does Ike's make some amazing sandwiches. The Adam Richman could be one of the best flavor combinations I've ever experienced. I miss that sandwich way more than is acceptable.</Text>

This is a great Ike's location with amazing sandwiches, but a very real lack of parking - especially after the city changed the back Street to permit parking only. Brace yourself for a tricky parking situation, but the sandwiches are well worth it!</Text>

I walked in and started exploring the menu when i came across a sandwich which had Halal Chicken and pig bacon in it. When i as a Muslim explained the manager regarding how serious this issue is about mixing these two, because as a muslim i was about to order that sandwich but Allah made me aware to read all that comes in sandwich saved me from eating pork. The manager then replied that he liked the way they two taste together pissed me off even more because i have met the owner in san Francisco location. Who was very nice and believed in selling Halal meat but today im ashamed of Ike's and plan not to ever go there unless that manager can do some studies regarding how Halal works and appologize and take off the bacon from menu. Its 3:40 pm in Santa clara, CA<//text>

<review>Great food, and super friendly staff. try Dutch Crunch with dirty sauce and check out their some times I am vegan and spiffy tiffy, the vegan meatballs are amazing too.  try Voodo chips and their selective collection of drinks. over all a great place to eat food. but since it is closer to the de anza college a lot of people visit this place and so finding a parking spot becomes very difficult.<//review><resp>None</resp>< userid>

Sandwiches are heavy, and portions are large. The Andrew Luck and Menage a trois are my go-to. Lines can get ridiculously long, but the sandwiches are so worth it. Prices are relatively standard<//Review>

A literal wall of vegan and vegetarians sandwiches. $10+ for a sandwich is pricey, but nothing beats Ike's. Plus you get a free lollipop. That's worth at least $0.25.<//Review>
