<text>I only gave 1 star because I had to give something to post. I just drove thru their driveway thru. We were asked to pull around for a small order. Kind of irritated but I like fresh food so I don’t mind waiting. I ordered extra sauces and they gave us the wrong ones. I politely asked for ranch and the staff member ignored my request and said it’s all in there. Argued with me while I was showing her the sauces. Then she REACHED IN MY CAR AND RIPPED THE SAUCE OUT OF MY HAND. I immediately called and asked for a manager, they refused and hung up on me. The “manager” came out with my ranch. I attempted to tell her what happened and she clearly could not have cared less. OVER A $1 sauce that I would’ve gladly paid for had I been asked. Even though I originally ordered it as an extra knowing and accepting the extra fee.

I will NEVER go to that location again.</text>< Pictures>

I was extremely impressed. I don't eat meat so ordered a Greek Salad without meat. I ordered a small and came with Pita or Garlic Bread. The salad was delicious!! The customer service at the counter was great. I actually cannot wait to go back.< /Text>

Most plates here serve 2 people.
My wife and I typically share the gyro plate and humus.
We still had enough to take home and eat later.
The place is pretty clean inside.<//Review>

Excellent Gyros plates with tender meat on thick pita, hot crispy fries and dill sauce.
Fast friendly service. My buddy eats here so much, the waitresses all know his order. Drive through is quick despite usually long lines.</review>

Pros: Good food, quick service. Chicken, zucchini, and rice all highly recommended.
Cons: "No large sides" (despite being included in combos) / "small sides" feel undersized. Salad is underwhelming.</text>

<text>Update- they don't accept Discover cards.

I would be giving this 5 stars because they have very good food!  Love their fish and any of their chicken selections are tasty and never dry!

However!  They NEVER give more than a TINY SPLASH of malt vinegar in their pacs!  The first photo is what comes each time... the second is 4 pacs poured into 1 - you can see it is STILL less than half full!!

This is disgraceful.  Malt vinegar is not expensive.  There is no excuse for this.

I have not commented before because I did not have a large enough sample- but now I have ordered fish enough times to be willing to believe my conclusions are valid!< /text>< Time>

<username>Sara Fields</username><Resp>None</Resp><text>Overall decent food, but lately I have been concerned with the consistency of the food received. My first few times eating at this location the food was fresh, flavorful, and the chicken fell off the bones. However, the last times I ordered my food the Pitas have been overcooked/hard (as if reheated instead of fresh) and unfortunately my dark meat chicken drumstick and thigh combo was dried out. Very unlike my earlier experiences of quality of food from this location.

I do want to note that the staff are always kind, acknowledging, and helpful. The interior of the restaurant has been clean in past experiences too.< /text>< Rating>

They have been here for many years and the place just as shiny and clean as when they first opened. Also doesn't hurt that their food is fantastic. I like to order the large gyros or chicken salad it can easily feed a family of 4 for just $20.</review>

Pricey but good food. If you're feeding a large group the large salad is perfect. We usually get the chicken on the side so it keeps longer in the fridge.<//Text>

Today we order 3 gyro sandwiches and this time very small amount compared to inflated prices you pay at the drive through. I will never go there again taking advantage of this time you won’t get your money’s worth here.</Text>

<review>The food is simply put....Incredible! The staff are great but do feel bad for them because the manager/owner seems to rule with an iron first....he is all over the staff every time I go there right behind them and that's got to be aweful for them. The manager/owner should back off the staff because they are doing a great job but look scared if they do anything wrong. If customers can see that, imagine what the stress the staff must be under. If no one's told you....staff....you're all doing a great job!</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

My husband just picked up dinner at Greek Chicken in Lakeside. We love the food but we continually get the wrong order. When I called to tell them that we got a gyros plate instead of the sandwich and no dressing with the salad, I was told that the next time we come through  they'd reimburse is for the dressing
Really!
I said, "If that's all your going to do, forget it". Apparently they don't need our business<//review>

First off let me start by saying that I love the Greek chicken on graves. I sometimes go twice a week. That being said I came to the Greek chicken on winter gardens and I am highly disappointed... I went a 320 in the afternoon went through the drive through which was empty and waited over 15 mins for my simple order. Chicken dinner , potato salad and fried zucchini... I have never had chicken like this from Greek chicken ever but this time was different, the chicken was so dry... the zucchini was nothing but pure mush in the middle and they are usually so tasty... I will stick to the Greek chicken on graves< /Text>

Food is exceptional, always good. Unfortunately the attitudes and the strict "policies" of the staff is less than.
Teach your staff friendliness and customer service.Smile once in a while! Your not robots.
Gives a lot of ideas about the owner.< /Text>

Setup and location is a little weird, but the service is great. Pretty girls work the counter and the food is pretty tasty. Actually it's the "pita sauce" which is really just tzatziki with loads of garlic in it. It's heavier than you're used to, thus, amazing! Get extra<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>We have picked up food from 3 Greek Style Chicken locations, in El Cajon and Lakeside, CA for 9 years now.  The food is exceptional and somewhat healthy, very healthy if you compare it to just about any other fast food restaurant.  The Greek salad is awesome and the dressing is very good.  There are many combinations but they will make alterations to suit you too.  They are always helpful and cheerful.  Don't miss the Banana Split, it's freshly made plus they have a small size in a cup, which blends together but I don't mind.  Yum!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>I was treated for the first time by a friend from church, man I am not real big on salads I don't make myself but their salad is to die for, and the chicken is so good and tender you have to be careful not to eat the bones, its by far the place out there to get chicken,  and they have Alaskan cod with several side's to choose from, I had the deep fried zucchini and of course its my favorite now , decent prices too for the quality,  definitely worth it.<//Review><user_name>Barbara Chaffin<//user_name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< date>

The place sure has changed, before when you walked in and placed your order and sat down they would bring your food to you. Now you have to pick up your own food. And NO the place was not busy,there were only two other couples there.What's the story,there were 3 people behind  the order counter doing ???????<//text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Horrible customer service!!! Paid for extra Pita Bread and Gyro sauce, did not receive it. Mentioned it at my next visit and asked to be provided with at least a small container of gyro sauce... was rudely told, "we can't do anything about it" ...so I ended up having to buy it again. That will be my LAST visit there- Way to lose a frequent customer over $1.03, guys! It's bad enough your meals don't come with a drink like EVERY other place out there.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80d958820ffe6067:0x901c6d32f3155206< /gmap_id></record>

This place is just like the two Greek Chicken branches in nearby El Cajon, only a lot less crowded. The food is always fresh and delicious and the place is spotless. We usually get the single-skewer chicken kabob dinner, which consists of five or six large chunks of grilled chicken breast on a skewer, a big side of Greek-style rice, four quarters of pita bread, and a substantial and delicious Greek salad packed into a small bowl. You order at the counter and they call your number when your order is ready, so there's really no service and it's probably fine not to leave a tip, making the total cost for my usual meal only about twelve bucks without a drink. We go here several times a month and it never disappoints.</text>

<Review>Once again, I don't get what I ordered in my bag.  Haven't been to Greek Chicken since the last post.  Well, again I won't be back.  Managers could care less.

When this is the most expensive drive thru and they don't put your entire order in the bag.  First time it happened, gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Second time, there are issues with lazy employees not doing their job to check the food is put in the bag, and telling the customer what is in the bag!  We will go elsewhere!</Review><GmapID>0x80d958820ffe6067:0x901c6d32f3155206</GmapID>< rate>

<Review>Talked my wife into trying Greek Style Chicken in Lakeside, I've eaten at the El Cajon location many times before and it was always a good experience. We ordered a burger,gyro and some zucchini, $18.00 but I assured her it was going to be worth it, I tipped the cashier a buck, Food was prompt, it  looked and smelled great. I started into my Gyro and noticed there wasn't any Taziki sauce, Ranch for the Zuc's and a small container of "secret sauce" for the burger my wife requested. I went back to the original cashier as she was returning from busing a table and accidentally dropped wrappers and napkins, I picked them up for her and asked for some Taziki sauce, she said " Um well, that will cost you $1.08" I responded, " I just bought a Gyro" in which the cashier snapped back "Well she exchange it for Thousand Island dressing!" I said no she didn't, she just asked for extra dressing for her burger." I returned to our table without another word or the Taziki sauce. Working in retail for 28 years, I  realize the battles of customer service. I watched and listened to the  cashier as she Mad-dogged  me and talked about the situation with the other employees. Reading their menu board it says "Like our service, tell a friend, Don't? Tell us" We finished our meal and I approached the cashier again and asked for the manager, she snapped, "He's not here!" I said "at noon, the busiest time of the day?" "Nevermind, what's his name," she said George!" Hopefully this will affect their star rating and the elusive George will get a slap. Lost my business forever.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I am completely BLOWN AWAY!!!! I live up on the mountain and they stayed open just for my mom and I since there was a bad accident and we were late. The work is phenomenal, my nails are so sleek. NO acrylic under the nail or on my skin. If I could give a higher rating I would. Tony did my nails tonight, they’re beautiful. THANK YOU!!!! I highly recommend!!!< /Text></record>

<Text>I've been coming to Village Nails since they opened over 16 years ago. We moved to Beaumont after living in East Highland Ranch for 10 years and I looked for a nail salon closer to home, but nobody does pedicures like here! Tony & Cece are amazing people and do great nails as well! If you love pedicures like I do, Village Nails is THE BEST!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>1st time I've a tried this place made and it will be the last due to the reason I am not satisfied with my service of nails told her from the beginning that I did not like what she was doing and still ensured me she knew and was going to fix it, well I'm not satisfied.  Didn't have the color I wanted.
Made  me wait for 30 minutes after my appointment time. Too expensive. Please people dont go to this place you will be disappointed.< /review><Name>JEnnyfer Melgoza</Name><Resp>None< /Resp><date>1571620507443< /date><user_id>114430962736620191867</user_id></record>

Been going here for nine months. Never had a problem until recently. Whatever chemical was put in the water for my  pedicure this time tarnished and stripped my sterling  silver ankle  bracelet and toe ring.. Ive had this  bracelet for 20 years and never had a  problem  with pedicures. It costs me 50 dollars from Zales to restore it. I showed my receipt  from Zales and pictures of my damaged ankle bracelet.The manager apologized but offered no no kind of monetary compensation. Customer beware of your jewelry.  You may want to take it off before you dip!</text>

<text>Had an issue with a manicure. Went in and manager says to sit down. Asked if I remembered who helped me. I gave the name Mary. Out comes a lovely young lady, Mary, but not the same. She said no problem, say right down and gave me a new manicure, which I was told was complimentary. It was not only free, but young Mary who didn't do original job, refused to take a tie from me. It's a nice clean place and everyone is pleasant. This is my nail salon now. I just moved here, so real nice experience!< /text><Name>Melanie Zimmers<//Name>< Gmap_id>

As always they give you the royal treatment. Mona is probably the best manicurist/ pedicurist person there. Receptionist is very professional.<//Text>

Just went here for the first time because my regular nail salon is closed for a few days. Paid $67 for a 10 mins pedicure and fill. Overpriced. The lady who did my fill put 5 coats of nail polish so it's so thick and bumpy. My nails look like I asked for duck nails, they are so wide. I read the reviews so I wonder if they just had me sit with the ladies who don't do a good job because I wouldn't know better. So upset I should have waited. Waste if money.<//Text>

Best pedicures EVER!! I've been going to Village Spa & Nails since they opened. I've tried other places, but none compare. The Spa is clean and comfortable. The pedicure chairs are new and and they have a wonderful massaging feature. They provide services from a basic mani/pedi to the more lengthy and relaxing Spa Manicures and Pedicures featuring a variety of oils, scrubs and lotions to choose from. My favorites are the Hawaiian Pedicure and the Chocolate Pedicure.<//Text>

This was a nice place but now the pedicure chairs are really old. They should have been replaced over a year ago. A broken table attachment snapped my finger and now I think I'm going to lose my nail. They didn't even apologize. Sad.</text>

<Date>1502848312115< /Date><text>Went in with my teenage daughter and asked for mani/pedi.  They started our pedis right away then we were asked if we wanted manicures as well.  Apparently the employee that initially asked what we needed didn't listen.  My daughter and I each refused gel nail polish at least three times.  Still got gel polish and we were charged for it.  They charged $6 to put animal stripes on my daughter's toes without asking what type of design she would like.  We won't go back.  Three of the four ladies that provided services were great but I don't appreciate being charged for things I said I didn't want.  After all that, the gel polish on our fingers did not last a week.<//text><Rate>2<//Rate><UserId.>106646202422665953693< /UserId.></record>

Highly disappointed!! Went in at 10 am no one was there got seated for pedicure and full set. Well a 11 o'clock appointment came in with 3 other individuals at 10:15. So they STOP my manicure for this party that was 45 minutes early. And didn't return to complete mine for another hour. While this was happening I'm 9 months pregnant and needed a pedicure more than anything in the world so I was stoked to get that done
While the lady doing my feet was on her phone checking what ever every 15 minutes she scrapped the bottom of my feet so bad with the little scrubber that I bled and had scratches on my feet that are in blistering pain now. To boot the lady with her party of 3 spent a grand total of $51 while I sat there in pain bleeding and unappreciated being left unattended for $59. JOKE!!! I'LL leave my future business to the one down the street near lowes. Way better service!<//Text>

Horrible service cut me multiple tiles, made my nails shorter then I wanted before she even asked , was I very rude to me , I paid 15 and left because she kept hurting me over and over , she also was going to charge my cousin $15 for a polish change and then tried to cheated it to 17 right before, this place is extremely unprofessional and I wouldn’t recommend it at all</text>

<text>Great little Asian market! Chinese Roast Pork is beyond excellent. Tender, crispy skin and the best Chinese seasoning... salty sweet. The price is also excellent. Over the Asian markets in Stockton blvd., they sell them for almost $14 a lbs and they are nowhere near the quality and taste as Wing Fa's Chinese Roast Pork and they sell them for only $8.99 a lbs. Cash only and no ATM cards.< /text>< name>

<Review>Very small store but the hot food really surprised me. I will be trying the Roast Duck next time.

Barbecued Pork Ribs and Crispy Roast Pork Belly are much better than the "Asian market" of the Broadway.<//Review>< name>

Every time I am n the area I stop in this market for their fried chicken wings.   Better than any restaurant I've experienced.   The people are friendly and eager to please.  And they charge you by the pound; not by the pieces.<//Text>

Very clean.  Immaculately stocked shelves. Great selection of basic Asian cooking staples.  A nice surprise find.

Found this place by accident while stopping by to grab food at Harry's Cafe.  Decided to take a peak inside after noticing they had a sign for BBQ pork and other take-out food.  Was very pleased to find some very nice fresh veggies. They didn't have a huge selection,  but did have my favorites, bok choy, gai lan and long green beans.  The shelves are packed with Asian sundries and very well organized and everything was very clean.  The owners obviously take a lot of pride maintaining their store.</text>

Wing Fa is a good Chinese grocery store for its size! It has basic produce, tons of noodles, and a pretty hefty freezer section. The dim sum bags and the take out food are the shining spots here, though! It is strictly cash only!</Review>

All kinds of specialty Asian cuisine items such as dried mushrooms, various teas and spices, pickled quail eggs, Taiwan Style Herbal Gelatin, etc. Somewhat unusual produce like kohlrabi and bitter melon. Mid-November and they had Napa Cabbage for 99 cents. They also sell cooked-to-order chow mein, fried rice, and other dishes for $6 per pound or so. Peking Spare Ribs, Empress Chicken, and duck for a little more. Be aware, though, that they only accept cash.< /review>

Wing Fa Market is a tiny Chinese market packed with asian groceries and some fresh produce. They also have roasted meats, take out, and bakery items.

I went by yesterday to see if they had Gai Mei Bao (Chinese Coconut Cocktail Buns). The clerk I spoke to had a strong accent, but she was very friendly and quickly grabbed a scrap of paper to write on to help me understand her. I appreciated her help and I didn't feel out out place as a white girl in a Chinese store. She said they would have some the next day and asked if I wanted some Pork buns, as she took down an order for me. When I came in today, she recognized me and I didn't even have to mention my order! The other customers were friendly as well.

I have tried a couple of other places in Sacramento for Gai Mei Bao, and I think this one is the best. I also enjoyed their Pork Bao. Yum! I think they only get the bakery items on Friday afternoons (around 12:30). A long line quickly formed as I waited for the delivery to arrive, so you might want to place an order ahead of time.

So, not only were the Bao delicious, but a very good price! The Pork buns were $0.90 each and the Gai Mei Bao were $0.45 each! Awesome! (But they don't take credit cards!)

They have take-out, but it looked like there were only six items (some available as chicken or pork), and one very large size. Next time, I will come early before the rush and ask them more about their take-out dishes. I got a box of fried rice, for about $6.00. You get a lot for the price, and they went in back to cook it--so you have to wait--but it's fresh. I perused the grocery isles and picked up some Hoisin sauce while I waited. The fried rice was ok, but I didn't think it had a lot of flavor. (Maybe because I really wanted the Chow Mein, but had to avoid it due to a temporary diet restriction.) I added some soy sauce and my newly-purchased hoisin sauce to my fried rice when I got home, and enjoyed it more that way.

Directions:
It's a little hard to spot, since it's a very small store, and there are trees in front. If you're coming down 16th Street, from HWY 50, it's just past U St. on the left (after Kiyo's Floral Design, Harry's Cafe, and an empty looking building). There is a sign on the side of the building, which you can see from this direction, if you're looking for it.< /text>

<review>Normally I would not leave a negative review but my experience with the Chula Vista office was terribly disappointing and I don’t want anyone to experience what I have and spend so much money and not get what they needed. I had to go back on three different occasions after my initial exam because I was given glasses with the wrong prescription, then another time the wrong measurements, another time because one pair wasn’t ready, and the frames for both glasses I purchased were flimsy and cheap not like the first time I bought here. The staff was nice but the service provided was not professional.

A few things I would recommend would be to make sure you receive the proper prescription, and the correct measurements and you’re working with staff members that know how to do these things properly. I understand your eyes may need time to adjust to the new hardware but they gave me headaches and I could not see except for the very BOTTOM of the lenses. And when I say bottom, without exaggeration, I mean almost the rim of the bottom of the glasses.

After trying to make it work and not wanting to go back a fifth time, I decided to go elsewhere and they gave me another prescription and my eyes are SO MUCH BETTER. Plus I received excellent quality service and glasses within record timing.

I apologize for the negative review but this must be taken care and addressed with staff because these are our eyes which need the utmost care.<//review>< rate>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>I got two glasses one eyeglasses were fine, but my second eyeglasses had higher prescription  on my left eye. They took my eyeglasses and they were going to fix it. I didn’t get call or text. I came today to see what happen and yes they had my glasses, but it was not fix plus they scratched the frame 😠. Now, I’m waiting here, hopefully this get fix soon. I’ll update If I get help.

<Review>They have a $59.95 promotion where you can get 2 glasses and an eye exam. It's a pretty good deal but watch out for the limited stock of these promotional glasses and the upsales!  There are only a  limited amount of these promotional glasses, like 20 pairs per section (men's, women's, etc). All the other glasses are priced higher and you get to pay for the more expensive of the 2 that you decide to get.  Then, if you want thinner lenses, bifocals, progressive, tinting or any extra niceties, it'll cost you more, sometimes a lot more. In addition, there were only 3 employees there and they were always juggling customers.

The day I went in, there wasn't an optometrist on the premises (Only on Mondays, apparently) so my eye exam was conducted remotely by a person on a computer monitor. She did a good job and produced a prescription for me. However, it was just for glasses and they needed to contact the doctor to get an updated prescription for contacts. That took an hour so I asked them what the holdup was and they said that they have to get an approval from the remote doctor but they didn't send the contact prescription so the technician has me redo the test again.  All in all, I was in there from 10:15 AM until 1:30 PM. That was way too long! I ended up getting another complete eye exam which they didn't charge me for but that ultimately was good because they got the response from the doctor quickly and I was able to pay my bill and get out eventually.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Worst customer service. Do not expect to be seen even if you have an appointment. They always double book even if you have a confirmed appointment. Made another appointment, went in and couldn’t be seen again because the doctor was going to be in vacation that week. Then seems they have an issue if you are not available on THEIR time because of your own works schedule.</review><rating>1< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Called to get an exam done and have the results put on my form and they told me they can do it. I made an appointment and arrived and as soon as I showed them the form,  to put the results on they did not want to do it and told me that I would have to schedule another appointment to see an optometrist. I’m just trying to get a basic test done which I thought they could provide and they didn’t do it. I went to the national city location and same thing. I wasted two hours of my time for nothing. Go to Wal mart instead. Already scheduled with them and spoke with optometrist and they confirmed they will do the form. Walmart A grade Stanton F grade.<//review>

I have used Stanton Optical in Tyler Texas several times and experienced great service. I moved back to California and went to the Chula Vista location. Worst experience EVER!!! I went in for a contact lenses exam back in June and ordered contacts. Here I sit 1 month later with no contacts. Every time I call I’m either on hold for 30 or more minutes with no answer or I get transferred around, OR no one can explain what is going on. The people are rude and I can’t find the name of the district or area manager! They get mad when you call and tell you to just go online and check status. My order status has been “In review” all this time. Please don’t go to this location because you will regret it. I sure do!!!< /text>

<text>From the bad reviews it just seems like they love to complain. This place is busy but it is affordable. I had an appointment and still had a long wait but the staff there is understaffed and they definitely do what they can. The whole process was you go take an eye exam with a licensed eye doctor but like in a Zoom Meeting. After you choose your glasses as you wait to be called up. (This isnt really told to the customer but assuming this would make the best use of your time. The whole time waiting should've been your choosing process.) Once you get called up you get your quote and you choose your choices and pay and go home. Nothing crazy just make and appointment and its like any other eye doctor just more convenient and affordable. I do say because they do have variety of designer and higher end products too.<//text><response>None</response><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rating>5</Rating>< Name>

Great location, they have a nice variety of different glass frames. We made an appointment for the eye exam and they were very fast and friendly from the start. Daniel has been the representative that has been helping me with my glasses. He has been very attentive and professional. Thank you Daniel for the great customer service! 👍🏼 I would highly recommend this location.</review>

<name>Howard Jones</name><text>I got my glasses as ordered and enjoyed them at first. I broke my sunglasses and went back in and received another pair and paid my deductible and everything was fine as it was probably my fault. I broke that pair even though I was really careful. When I went back in they no longer had my frames in stock. The lady I spoke to told me she had to order them and if they no longer carried them I would have to choose another design. I told her that was fine just let me know. I waited for 2 weeks and never got a call. I finally called and got the runaround. I had to call 8 times to get an answer. I still don't know for sure what the answer was but the person I talked to said yes they were there and need to bring my lenses in to be installed. My question to him why couldn't they jus call and tell me?<//text>< gmapID>

<Text>Overbooked and understaff, they took about 3 hrs to get done with my moms appointment. They  Can’t even help with something as simple as giving you  some glasses that are ready to be picked up without making you wait. If you have time to waste then you won’t care about the wait. I do not recommend and will never be coming back here again. Customer service was average some nice staff and some rude. Forgot to add that it’s not affordable at all! Maybe if you have insurance but I ended up paying more than $300 for some very cheap glasses.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

If you're in the market for a new pair of glasses I highly recommend you come here. All staff was friendly and helpful. If you're there, ask for Daniel he took care of me, was very insightful, answered all of my questions and I'm sure he'll do the same for you. I went to a bunch of different places and was  told I had to wait about 2 weeks for my glasses to come in. At Stanton I was able to walk out the same day with 2 new pairs. Thanks again🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽< /text>

I made an appointment for 10:05. People didn't have an appointment and it was first come first serve. So what's the point of having an appointment. This place WAS NOT SANITIZED. They had cob webs in the corner and the carpet was visibly dirty. I only give it 3 sstars for Dr. Susie. She was the best part. Other than that i don't really like thus place.</text>

Don't waste your time. Very poor quality services.  1 hour 45 minute wait, 15 minute exam through a freaky tv style monitor.  They wanted another appointment with a "real"  doctor. In a week. Dingbat females working there were very unknowlageable rude, unprofessional and unpleasant to deal with. NEVER AGAIN.</Text>

This place is so unprofessional. They dont even acknowlege you when you walk in store. They dont help you for more than 30 min. Most importantly I have been waiting since July 10 for my glasses...Is now August 19 and still no glasses. I was supposed to get them on July 24th and nobody cares that I still have no glasses! They just keep giving me another date that doesnt happen. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else.<//Review>

<review>Really bad experience, they advertise 2 pairs for $50.95 including eye exam. They ended up charging me.$300 for 2 pairs, my son really needed them so I got them, less than 1 month after buying them both frames broke. I took them back because "they had insurance".  Until today is been 1 month from that day and now the frame is lost and my son has no glasses. It sucks don't go there. I'm here and there is 4 angry customers. Worst customer service worst quality products.</review>< Pictures>

Wasted $89 for contacts prescription. Optometrist only comes every Saturday. Took me 2.5 months to NOT getting my prescription. After asking for a refund in store and getting denied , called corporate office , they refused refund as well. I explained after 2.5 months and going there 5 or 6 times I should have my prescription ready.
Solution was actually surprisingly simple in my case- 1-800-contacts app from where I ordered before let me order contacts again and they don’t care about prescription expiration. I wish I could get my $89 back though< /text>

They did the eye exam.  I need big vocals they measured me  and I want transition lenes in one pair and sunglasses in the other well after 3 weeks I finally got one pair .But they  didn't  have bifocal lenses.

Then the front desk lady asked if i had filled out the tablet. I saw this happening to other customers. The Optometrist had people back to back coming into the room to get examined. I never saw her sanitazing the room, as soon as one customer came out she called the other one in right away. She doesn’t desinfect anything and I dont know what the protocols for COVID are here but I know if restaurants are very strict with social distancing and desinfecting, I am guessing any facility with patients should have some sort of protocols.< /text>< pictures>

I must let you all know, the advertisement of 2 pairs for $59 is not true. Which should be almost obvious when they charge $50 for the eye examination. Don't be fooled for an opportunity of a cheap price, take your money somewhere else since you will be paying the same just without the lies.<//text>

<text>I went to see if they could repair the tint on my prescription sunglasses. Because i was past my warranty by a few days, it was going to cost me $130. Even under warranty, i would pay $80. These glasses cost me $280. The glasses would of been cheaper at walmart but i thought paying higher end would be better. Boy was i wrong. Never going back.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Jerry was also super helpful when I had some questions about what frames would be best. Heather was very patient in explaining whats best for me and took the time to make sure I understood. I will definitely be back to this store and will be referring my family. I am very happy with the service I received!

For the very first time since I started wearing prescription glasses, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  The optometrist who conducted the eye exam was the BEST!! He was patient and professional.  He didn't make me feel rushed when selecting the correct lens strength.  He asked
specific questions about my eye health and he really listened to me.  The frames staff did not rush / pressure me to make a frame selection.  The  frames were very reasonably priced.  My glasses were ready earlier than the projected pick-up date.  All in all it was a wonderful experience.  Best of all, I can see!!!< /review>

My glasses broke, so I had to get a new pair quickly. I saw the advertisement for 2 pairs + eye exam for $59, so I was thrilled. Until I got to the store and saw that all 3 frames eligible for the deal were either for children or bright green. So I had to pick a more expensive frame. When I went to purchase, they informed me the only lenses they had in stock were the most expensive ones with a bunch of unnecessary enhancements (what a coincidence). Long story short, I paid $178 when I was advertised $59. Absolute ripoff. And these were for the cheapest frames in the store. I highly regret shopping here, but I needed the glasses ASAP. Do not shop here.</Text>

< review>
This place is a joke! They said they would call when the first pair of glasses were ready to pick up. I didn’t receive a call so we went up there and got them. The 2nd pair was supposed to be ready within 14 days and they said they would call when they came in. 16 days later and still no call. I call them and they put me on hold for 10 minutes and never got back on the line. Frustrated I go there and have been sitting here for about 20 minutes watching them scramble around looking for the glasses. When I asked them if they were having trouble locating them the guy said they were finishing them now. I am guessing they didn’t even bother getting the 2nd pair ready in the 14 days I was told and are rushing to get them ready while we continue to sit here. Needless to say I will not be coming here in the future.<//review>

I was very picky, opinionated, and after turning down (4) stores prior to Stanton Optical, determined on not compromising for the style and look that I deserved. Not only was I impressed by the large selection of styles and name brands. But the level of service, knowledge, undivided attentiveness and the overall experience from start to fitting of the Sales Manager was clearly a benchmark above others before. She was very professional, and made my wife and I feel like we knew we entered the right store. Especially after I found exactly what I've been looking for. I'm looking forward to enjoying my new eyes in style now. Bee Gees "Stayin Alive" song in my head as I walk out the store a very satisfied new customer wearing my new prescripts.< /review>

<Text>I was there looking for replacement glasses since mine are getting pretty old and Irma was amazing! Not only was she patient with me while I took my time looking around (I am very picky), but she walked the whole store atleast twice grabbing lenses in colors and styles I kept describing to her even though I insisted she didn't have to. She even cleaned up the piles of glasses as quickly as she brought them to me. Great customer service and I will continue to use them.<//Text><time>1524526934032< /time>< gmap_id>

I was referred by a friend. The staff is very kind and extremely helpful, and they have lots of styles to choose from. They informed me that they would give me a call once ready and I never received a call of sort. I gave them an out of state address to send my order to and that info was never noted down (idk how if info was repeated to me twice).. point is, I had to call customer service and give them my new address. If I wouldn't of called, my order would still be sitting in there location. Just a bit disappointed.  But i hope this doesn't happen to anyone after me.</Review>

< Review>
Everyone was super nice and very  helpful. Sometimes picking out glasses alone (especially when you can't see what you look like because you're not wearing your glasses) can be very stressful and overwhelming. But Isabel who helped me out that day not only gave helpful feedback, she ended up picking the glasses I chose for me and I love them! Great pricing packages, guarantees, and even an optional frame club allowing 4 new free frames in the next 2 years with the purchace of just the lenses. Overall great deal especially when some glasses can be done day of and everyone is so nice even if you're picky. Thanks again!</Review>

Descent selection of eye wear,  but the sign on the window is misleading. You'll have to pay for the exam. They try and say you actually save on the purchase of the glasses.  Also you have to be careful who's helping you. The person who helped my wife didn't  say she was buying a pair glasses for men.  She ended up with mens glasses that were too long behind the head.< /review>

<review>Worst costumer service ever! They didn’t call me about my order being dones said it would take 3 days and in actuality, it took 2 weeks. When I get there, I wait 45 mins to receive a pair that wasn’t mine but said my pair was discontinued. Thanks for the update? Had to take the wrong pair because all the glasses they had have designs on them if they’re black. My discounted pair were all black. Not a bad company just a bad branch. Would rather take a longer drive to a different one.<//review>< username>

This is my 3rd time coming back to this location. Nick Sirio and his staff are very courteous. I've gotten pairs for my daughter and Mom. This time it's for me. I used to be a Walmart Optical customer. NIck showed me that customer satisfaction is more important than the sale itself. That is how customers come back. I encourage everyone to try this location. You will be happy you did.</Review>

<review>The promotion they advertise comes with a very minimal selection of glasses.  Be aware of this.  I only saw approximately 10 pair of glasses in the 59 ish amount for thier promotion.  Very disappointed.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<user>114769444183565292705< /user><Review>59.00 is for not attractive glasses and basic lens.  VERY few choices at that price too.  The other better looking glasses are regular price then you need to add the cost of , bifocal fee, progressive lense fee, non glare fee, scratch resist fee, transitions fee.  It takes at least two weeks to get your glasses too since the dont have lab on site.  Still, its just a bit cheaper that Costco which has an awesome FAST lab.  I still have not received my glasses so i dont know if the lab did a good job on the progressive lens.  Will update later.<//Review><Date>1549739675298<//Date><name>sonia michel<//name><rate>4< /rate>< pictures>

I called on a Saturday. And I got 2 pairs of glasses with bifocals and transitions changing lenses with my prescription. And a warranty on both pairs. I showed my VA card and got a great deal. Very Happy. One pair was 280.00 @ WalMart with No Warranty. Maribella, really hooked me up on Palomar. Thanks.</Text>

First of all I want to commend on Jerry's efforts, he's patient and very helpful, thank you Jerry for great effort, you're a definet asset to this company. As far as the store, well I think16 days was to long to wait for glasses, and I was pissed that I had to go  back so many times. Especially when I had to go back because one of the lenses kept falling out of the sun glasses. I also don't like that they wanted to be paid before I got the glasses. Would you pay for a car before you drove it, of course not. Aside of all the problems, thanks to Jerry he made the best of it for me and was apologetic for the problems I experienced thru the whole ordeal and I really appreciate it. Thanks again Jerry, you're the best thing about that whole store. Keep up the good work, in my opinion, you should be managing that store.</review>

Okaaay, I came back because of a Groupon that caught my attention. It was $150 for $32. I thought, "hey, now I can get a third awesome pair of glasses!"-- I knew I was going to be paying a little more than expected but.. dang, I almost regretted getting the Groupon at all. Quite the different experience than when I visited and reviewed back in April..

Upon arriving, they had no idea I was coming although I had called ahead and made an appointment. I initially spoke to Ivan who didn't know my name or why I was there. Quite the bummer since I explained everything over the phone. He informed me that I had called 'support line' instead of the actual store. Nevertheless, he was very willing to help me.

As much as he could, at least..

I explained to him I wanted the exact same type of glasses I had ordered back in April and was hoping to get them for the L O W L O W since I had the $150 Groupon. That's when he informed me he would try to "help me out" because he wouldn't be able to use that coupon with the pricing I received before. Maaaaaan.. I didn't get upset but it did make me roll my eyes and it let me know I had walked into a "used car dealership" kind of vibe. Huge bummer and very 'scam-esque'..

As much as Ivan wanted to help, there was still a tug-of-war between him and I. Where he wanted to try to get every single penny he could out of me and I wanted to save every single penny I could. I mean, I walked in there with a Groupon after all~.. I'm clearly trying to save some cash, man!

I wasn't rolling over for him and he (said he) couldn't provide me with the price I was looking for. I had walked in there thinking, "I'll pay $30 for my frames via Amazon, $32 for the Groupon and pay another.. what?.. $30 bucks at Stanton? Heck, let's make it $40 bucks! I'll get another pair for a total of ~$100 for a new pair altogether." -- that was not the case AT ALL. Ivan tried to get me to pay something like.. $170 for BETTER glasses (Ivan, if you're reading this, sorry if I forgot the exact amount, but it was ridiculous, man!). I cleaaarly wasn't having that. He then said something like $130? and that was totally not flying for me.

We WERE NOT on the same page..
Ivan had clearly had enough. I had communicated with him that it really felt like he was on commission and didn't want to go through all struggle. I wanted (again) the L O W L O W . I didn't want him asking him, "what's the most you want to spend today?". Like.. come on, man. Want me to say ten bucks? After some miscommunication, Ivan was visibly frustrated (and I get it.. I was NOT about to pay $100 bucks and he wasn't budging).

He said the magic word: Manager.

Nick came in to save the day.
He was much more understanding and had more power to get me a much more reasonable price. He got me the same pair of glasses I got earlier this year for $55 dollars. I was happy with that. Win some, Lose some.

Unfortunately, after this experience, I wouldn't recommend this store to EVERYONE. If you do decide you're brave enough, make sure you're ready to bargain and fight a little bit, like at the swap meet. Or if you have sales experience, that helps too!

I don't wanna give Nick anything lower than 3 stars after he hooked me up.

04/2018

I'd recommend it.

The price did drag me in, 2 for $69 is pretty awesome.. however, I knew my eyes were pretty bad. I figured the price would get bumped up one way or another.

It was.
I paid $49 for the exam and then was approached with a proposal of $359 for two AMAZING pair of glasses.
But.. there was the price jump.
From $69 to $400. Yikes.

Heather was extremely patient and helpful. We were able to go down to $110 for some lesser quality lenses. That plus the $49 eye exam. She threw in a few things too.
This didn't seem so bad. My eyes are horrible and require some thick lenses. I gotta be fair!
Ended up paying about $75 a pair.

4/5 stars becaaaause..
Although you can't call them a "SCAM".. you can say they have the intention of luring you in and then trying to upsell you.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1544729088293, 'text': 'Hello oscar duran jr.\nWe apologize for all the troubles you have gone through in our store.

<review>Stanton Optical gave me a a very great experience! Lots of friendly employees who are very attentive to your needs! I have not worn glasses in about a year so I had nonidea what would look good on me or not. The guy who helped me, Jesse, had a great attitude about his work and lifted the mood of everyone around him, he saw that I was being a bit picky with my selection of frames so he asked me "what is your favorite color?" "Brown!" Jesse disappears for a second and pops back up with at least 6 different pairs of very stylish frames for me! He helped me out a lot with that one because I can never decide! Everyone else at Stanton Optical had a great attitude and  the Optometrist is soooo funny! She is just a character! All together going there and meeting these happy people was very nice and ai am so satisfied with my glasses they are CUTE!!! Thanks everyone at Stanton Optical :)< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I have had the best experience since 2019, Carolyn is definitely an asset to the Stanton optical. she is easy to talk to English and Spanish, super sweet and knowledgeable.

Even with the pandemic it felt really comfortable, I didn’t even notice I was wearing glasses and a mask. Perfect atmosphere and customer service 5 Stars</Review>< rating>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Made it over for dinner with some friends, we heard about it from some locals. Dinner was super light, I had the beet & arugula salad to start, sea bass and a cocktail that tasted like a mojito (however it was made with wine...super unique!) Seeing in how the bar only serves beer and wine it was an experience to try the cocktail menu. Server was very helpful. Dessert was the best, anything nutella has my name on it!!!< /text>< Name>

I was so hungry I ordered the pork duo and by the time had ate half of it and I said wow to myself like 15 times I had to slow down to enjoy the experience even longer... By the end I was almost crying it was so good. Great spot would recommend to everyone. I can't even remember what was here before, but this place I will never forget.<//Text>

The food was excellent! Waited too long between starter and main course. For a restaurant that serves Italian food, it was disappointing there was no espresso available but only drip coffee. Would definitely come back, good atmosphere.< /Review>

This place is horrifically overrated.

Shirt ribs: dry and boring
Lamb won tons: bland and soggy
Cod: flavorless and small
Fries: fine, but the aioli is just mildly flavored mayo.
Adult Frosted Flakes: a bowl of soggy Frosted Flakes with warm rice pudding with just a cinnamon flavor.

Really quite disappointing and a poor showing for a west LA restaurant. go to charcoal or tasting kitchen or the Wallace instead.
Don't waste your time or money here.< /review>

<text>Upscale dining with ultra-creative dishes.  Try the Kale Frys and be sure to take one bite with both kale and fry for a savory delightful twist on an everyday delight.

The menu changes seasonally and per meal segment so there is always something new to discover in a familiar place.

Give Matt, the general manager, a high five for me.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Over-hyped celebrity chef with dull, way over-priced and under seasoned dishes and plenty of condescending attitude to go along with it.  The response to a wrong wine was "a look" and the bartender coming to correct it. Response to kitchen forgetting the potatoes another "look" and: "sure you haven't eaten them?...." Well, they were small, but not that small.  The "swiss chard" looked like the post dated dregs of a supermarket plastic container.  The "bulgogi seasoning" was totally absent.  The place is pretty and inviting in a muscular way.  We should have paid attention; the google map insisted this place was on the other side of the street.. and the impatient hostess who answered the phone wasn't any help either.  We had the most fun joking about it with the table next to us.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I'm not one to often write reviews, but I was able to experience this place last weekend as the grand finale to our Venice Beach experience. We were a party of 5 people and for the most part we all ordered different dinner entrées. We had two different apps and three different side dishes. I've sampled a lot of renowned chef's dishes, and this chef at Leona has a special talent with pairing and combining flavors to enhance the food. The dish is entirely different when the bite has one part of the dish versus all of the elements on the plate. For anyone who hasn't experienced that, I'd highly recommend trying this place out!

It's fine dining, so it's not for a faint bill fold, but the staff was very knowledgable and friendly. The atmosphere was clean open and classy. If I lived in the area I would certainly revisit often.< /review>< Pics>

Started out with poor service from the unfriendly hostess who didn't seem in a hurry to seat us even though our table was open and ready.  The waitress had a similar disposition.  First 2 courses were promptly delivered and good.  After that, looooong wait for main courses, no reason why.  Had just eaten at Charcoal two blocks down the street and couldn't figure out why anyone comes here when  Charcoal is available  ( they have a Michellin chef in their kitchen!).<//Review>

Leona has really become one of my neighborhood favorites! I recently celebrated a friends birthday on their private beautiful rooftop, it's like you're own little penthouse suite with all the amenities! Their family style catering is super delicious, specifically their bruschetta, ceviche, and lamb lollipops tray pass, and you can never go wrong with their Sea Bass, Salmon and Roasted Brussels. Highly recommend it for a private dinner and celebration!< /Text>

A cool hip place.  I really like the clean minimalist décor.

Went to Leona for brunch and food was delicious.  The Benedict was hearty, and can be a godsend for nursing hangovers.  The waffles are crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, just the perfect way.

Also would like to mention that their cold brew is intense and perfect for a caffeine-holic like me.  The Leona's coffee is a bit too sweet, and too coconuty though.</Review>

Best experience! The food is amazing! I would definitely go back again& again and again x infinity!!! The lamb belly dumplings, mouth watering! The wedge salad delightful! Tuna tartare, the flavors burst in ur mouth! Go try it for yourself. It's a very laidback and friendly environment.< /Text>

<Text>Dinner might be ok here but the brunch was pretty bad. Cup of coffee came late, food came very late and had to ask for it before it came. Multiple people came and left with service before we were able to leave. When it came time to pay the bill we had to ask  before being told the machines were down. We asked 3 more times over the course of 30 minutes before one of the staff came by with an iPad and charged our card without showing us the bill or itemized receipt.

Edit, just looked at menu prices versus prices on our bill after going inside and getting photos of the bill off the iPad, the manager on duty upcharged us on each item by 2-3 dollars.<//Text>< pictures>

usually as you get closer to the beach, the food get shittier and you end up paying up for location and scene. and venice to me is pretty mediocre overall as far as food. but leona is actually decent in terms of food, and i'd probably come here again for the food.

had the bulgogi short ribs. well, it's not really bulgogi in terms of flavor. i really don't know why they call it that. but it was good, and the short rib was braised and cooked nicely...very tender as you would expect. comes with bone marrow on the side, but that's not my thing.

had a bit of the risotto. less impressed with that, but it was okay, as well. a friend had the chicken which looked like a square. not sure what was up with that, but he said it tasted good.

one bummer is the parking situation. $9 for valet.< /review>

<Time>1440299895283<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>We came here the first weekend they offered brunch service.  I had a soft shell crab eggs benedict, and my husband had a burger with a beer.  The burger was a very substantial burger.  Even my husband, who is from Argentina and grew up on a small farm and may or may not know some things about beef, was impressed.  The burger was delicious, paired perfectly with a Saint Archer Pale Ale.  I had an Eggs Benedict with Soft Shell Crab.  Who would have thought to pair a meaty soft shell crab with eggs benedict?  Not I, but I was sure glad chef Nyesha Arrington did.  The hype of this stylish beachside bistro was well deserved.  Go before the whole town finds out about this little spot.<//Text>< pictures>

Horrible food and experience. In addition to waiting forever with just a handful of other customers there, our eggs and mushroom were pathetic and we were charged more than the menu list price (didn't notice until well after we left). Service is TERRIBLE. Will NEVER visit here again.< /Review>

<text>Arguably the best gel manicure I’ve ever had.  Great attention to detail and the shine is amazing.  Great pedicure as well.  My pedicurist escorted me over to the massage chairs for some relaxation as my toes dried.  I will definitely be back!< /text>< name>

I have to say that I have tried many, many nail salons in the San Pedro area. Aside from being a husband /wife owned business, these people are nothing short of Awesome! They are offer a very clean, professional surrounding, with a very kind staff. They do everything from mani/ pedi's to waxing. I suggest you give these people a try! You wont be disappointed!</text>

I have been there three times and the first two times there have been great.  But just last week I went to get a manicure and pedicure and the lady who did my manicure seemed to rush a lot not really taking her time, but in the end my nails looked fine. However, the lady who did my pedicure was trimming my nails and cut the right side of my right big toe nail too far... I has been hurting ever since and my skin around it looked infected...

I went to the doctor just yesterday an he told me it was an infected cuticle..  So we had to cut the infected area off and it wasn't the most pleasant thing...  It's still in pain and I will be talking to the company soon about it. 😔

But that's just two person at the salon, everyone else who has done my nails before have been great.  Just be careful next time when they trim the sides of your nails...<//text>

She and her husband Liam, together have created 1 of the nicest, cleanest most up to date, nail salons in San Pedro. With their team of 10 nail techs, you can get every type of nail salon service, mani & pedi, gel,  eye lash extensions, facials, waxing...on and on.

I would like to recognize Rafael for above and beyond customer service and an incredible owner driven successful small business.  I also own a small myself I know how difficult it is to make sure everything runs smoothly and also as a consumer how rare it is to find an owner that truly cares and wants to do everything he can to run a great business!   Also every time I see him he has a smile on his face and he just put you in a great mood it's like the Starbucks of car washes!</Review>

Great easy car wash. Get the $12 wash (up from $10 or $8) with the "triple foam" to have a multi-colored disco party as you go through the car wash. I'm surprised they don't market this. I paid for the cheaper one recently and was bummed to not get all the fun lights and colors...I didn't know it was only with the more expensive option!<//text>

Service is quick and responsive. If you need an oil change or some other work done you get a free car wash. I had my 2000 Dodge detailed. It was a mess before I drove in. Only waited 10 minutes account other customers ahead. $40 and it now is presentable to ride in.< /Review>

The employees are wonderful and they do a great job on the interior cleaning (add on option) when I get my oil change and car wash. They are always very polite and friendly!< /review>

I use to get a wash and a detail inside. I have even bought the get as many car washs you want in a month. Their is an employee there I believe his name is Byron.He has always been upbeat and professional. Outsideof these positives the water they wash your car with STINKS like has a bad smell almost as if they are recycling the water. It even leaves a stench on your car. I am into keeping my money in the community but not there until the water stink goes away!< /Text>

<Text>Customer interaction is poor. Service was very weak. Oil was changed and that was it.
No checking of other systems or tires.
2nd time for this. What happened to customer service?
Did get a good car wash.
I'm looking to go else where.< /Text>< user_id>

Customer interaction is 4/5. Performance is 1/5 with much left to be desired.
NOT the same as quality as they once were.
Dropped off my vehicle to be detailed. From past experience this can take up to an hour if busy. Left and came back to find my vehicle 'finished', it was anything but...
-Cup holders were left with fluid setting in them 'watered down windex' (one of their workers informed)
-Back seats were partially vacuumed, plenty of debris left in nooks and crannies. LOTS of missed and or ignored areas
-Seats barely, if at all, wiped down with obvious dirty spots untouched.
-Did not remove car seats or attempt to clean under or around (Once upon a time this was something they did with the exception of the vehicle owner being responsible to secure carseat when finished)
Not as detail oriented as they once were. Quality of service has diminished a great deal recently.
For the trouble I was given two free '$12 car washes.' I only wanted the problem fixed...
I will give another chance at a later date; if the results are the same I will not use their services again.< /Text>

Have been golng there for yrs.They told me it would $37 and change. When time to pay it was $57.36 why? Its because it was a 6 quart motor. Without my approval.  I would have put one more quart myself. I know I will not be going back.<//review>

Got the full service car wash and got WAY more than I expected.  A huge thank you to Chris and Brandon for an exceptional job well done!  Not only did they care for my car the same way I would have, I was even given a bottle of nice cold water and offered a chair to sit on while I waited.  Very professional and very customer oriented.  I will be back!  If you haven't gone for a car wash, I encourage you to do so.  If you get the same wonderful care I got (and I have NO doubt that you will), you won't be sorry!<//review>

These guys were great! I was going to drop my truck off for an oil change. While I was waiting for my ride, they finished my truck. They were done in 15mins! In and out service.
The technicians were kind and knowledgeable. They made wise suggestions for my oil type. Also showed me the dipstick before I left.
An oil change comes with a carwash!
I will go back!< /review>

I am a disabled vetern.  They Ripped me off!  Supose to change filter and showed  me an empty box and said see 5 times.   I thought it strange.
My son ask if I was sure, so we looked.
Old dirty oily filter still in truck. Went to Auto Zone and replaced it myself.</review>

I've been to the carwash twice now. Both times I was treated with respect, courtesy, and I observed the professionalism of all the staff. The car was cleaned to perfection which for me was much better than other carwashes have done. Plus, they do vacuuming, lubes and oil changes. These guys are the best!</review>

<Review>First time trying this place near where I live.
It was pretty good! The salad was very tasty. I ordered the chopped chicken salad and it was nicely made, with great flavor. I also ordered the bruschetta special appetizer - it didn’t have amazing flavor but it was definitely good enough for the special price. I got my son a 10” pizza with pepperoni - the sauce was good! The pepperoni was good quality and overall everything tasted good. I left full and happy. Thanks Crust - I’ll be back.</Review>< name>

So good! Very friendly staff. I'm not gluten free, but the gluten free crust was so good. I highly recommend. The wait staff are constantly walking around, checking on you, and stopping by to see how you are. If I lived closer this would be a regular place for my family. However my parents live there and they eat here often. Definitely worth your time.</text>

First time here tonight. We wanted to Celebrate my daughter's birthday so decided to give this place a try. Couldn't have chosen a better place. We ordered wings, pizza, and pastas. My wife got the big sexy one it was so good. I had the Kelley pizza pretty good. The wings were perfectly cooked and just the right amount of sauce. Besides the food being delicious the staff went above and beyond. They were so friendly and courteous. We had just about the whole Crew drop by our table to check on us. 1/22/21 who ever worked tonight you guys rocked. My family had such a good time and your Customer service is 110%! Will definitely be back. It's hard to find people that actually love their job now a days!<//text>

<review>We did in and finished everything so fast that we didn't get any pictures. The pizzas were amazing! The crust was chewy perfection. The wings had just a little heat to them and were finger licking good.  This restaurant just moved up a few places in our go to list.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Love this place. Both the Cesar and House Salads are great. The complimentary Focaccia Bread with Marinara Sauce went wonderfully with the Votre Pinot Noir. The Meatball and Onion Pizza was delicious. We keep coming back here for the amazing food!<//Text>< Pictures>

Really good and simple food, I mean it didn't seem like they do anything crazy which is nice sometimes.  Their selection of beer and wine does not really leave you wanting so that was pleasant for us.  It's really a no frills place with some nice photographs on the walls.  BTW, this is beer and wine only just an FYI.< /Text>

<text>Despite Crust being extremely busy on a Wednesday evening our server and other waitstaff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The Caprese salad was refreshing with the dressed arugula on the top in addition to the usual fresh mozzarella,  tomato slices and balsamic reduction. The pizza crust was crisp on the bottom with great texture and taste. The toppings of mushrooms,  roasted red peppers and carmelized onions was a perfect pairing for the salad and glass of wine.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< userid>

First visit with the girlfriend. She had the cheese lasagna and I had the penne pasta. Food was very good, however it is not the quality or quantity e,elected for what they charge.  The service was horrible. We were seated within a few minutes of walking in, but it took 10 minutes just to get a drink order and the server was absent a large amount of the time. We had to wait long lengths of time for literally everything including drink refills, our food in general and even the check. We requested a takeout box and were brought it 15 minutes later and then had to wait another 15 minutes for the check.  Thus was during a slow time and not peak hours, so I see no excuse for the lack of service. I give this place food 3 1/2 stars out of 5, but the service is maybe 2 if I'm being generous.< /text>

TERRIBLE service. sat down at 720 and got our food at 815 after only ordering soups or salads. had to repeatedly ask for water and still didn’t get refilled often. soup came VERY late and was cold. servers didn’t seem to know what they were doing. food was pretty good but service ruined the experience.<//Review>

We had a wonderful pizza experience at Crust Pizza!  We sat on the outdoor patio.  It was absolutely delicious!  They have many different types of pizza and all fresh ingredients!  The service was wonderful.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I am looking forward to going back again soon!</Text>

<Text>It just gets better & better. I started eating here shortly after it's opening about a year ago and was wowed by it's amazing pizza, the best I've had anywhere.  Well, that continues to be true and it doesn't stop there.  I fell in love with the spicy meatballs, the roasted artichoke appetizer, the spaghetti & meatballs and their host of lunch & dinner salads, all available with steak, chicken or my favorite, the new spicy blackened chicken.

Once again they've stepped up their game, adding amazing daily homemade soups and my absolute favorite ever salad, their "wedge".  It's a classic, with iceberg lettuce wedges (yes, plural...read HUGE), bacon, cherry tomatoes and a heavenly blue cheese dressing oozing around like white liquid gold. I top it with the blackened chicken and love it!  It's way too big but it doesn't stop me from eating the WHOLE thing, good thing I usually have a pal along to roll me out!

They also have a nice selection of craft beers and great wine at reasonable prices, all served by a young, cheerful & attractive staff.  So I only have two questions:

1. Can it get any better?
2. Why are you reading this when you could be there eating?

Now I've done it....I'm gettin' in my car and heading there NOW.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The servers were slow, and seemed clueless most of the time. Our waters were never refilled, and we had to ask for it. For a pizza place the pizza is sub-par. The pasta is very good, however. And the atmosphere is quite chill, so that’s why I give it an extra star.< /Review>

<Text>Horrible service. Hostess went to her car to grab something and didn't appear to be clocked in. Then another came and seated us.  We sat there and waited as three tables who'd been sitting there since before we got there finished eating and left. Then a waitress proceeded to help a table who'd already been served and didn't bother asking if we'd been helped yet. The only person I found helpful was the busser who brought us water immediately after sitting down. The next thing is this place is ridiculously priced!!! They charge you for splitting a check! And thirdly they have this little postcard asking you to vote for them for best pizza and best bartender; they're service took so long my boyfriend and I left before we even got to taste the pizza and their bar?!?!?! They only serve beer an wine!!!!  The place is a joke....<//Text><rating>1<//rating><user_name>Destini Edwards<//user_name><user>115537353750343574582</user><Response>None< /Response>< pics>

The food at Crust Pizzeria is outstanding! I recently attended a networking dinner at the new Crust in Torrey Hills, Carmel Valley. The staff, menu and ambience were excellent. Thank you for making it such a pleasant evening. Torrey Hills really needed a restaurant like this!<//text>

<Text>Service is subpar. The moment I walked through the door, not a single employee cared to make eye contact, much less make their way towards me. I would've been more understanding if the restaurant was filled, not just the single occupied table and the other customer at the bar.

When the customer that was chatting with the bartender noticed me, he asked her if she was going to help me and she said no, that someone else could take care of me instead. Foolish to think I didn't hear you bartender. I waited another 5 minutes before someone else finally approached me and then asked me if the bartender had helped me; apparently IT WAS the bartender's job to acknowledge me. Needless to say visiting this place was a rather underwhelming experience.</Text>< gmap_id>

First time and we weren't disappointed. The "Big Sexy" pasta was excellent with a wonderful mix of gouda and cheddar along with sausage, bacon & jalapeños. The gluten free pizza crust was tasty & crispy. The only issue was the noise level but it wasn't any different than most other places these days. We'll definitely be back and send friends here.</review>

<text>This Pizzeria has great food and service, We had 7 people at the table and everyone's pizza was delicious. Additionally,  the chicken parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs were excellent. As far as service goes, we had an outstanding waitress named Devin. If you can get her table, do so. You won't be disappointed.

<review>There was not one enjoyable thing about eating here. 1st we were Sat next to the door to outside which the waiters came in and out of constantly (it was cold). When we asked to sit somewhere else they said we would have to wait instead of just moving the table a few feet. The waitress was largely absent (took 30 min to order food, forgot several requested items). When we finally got our pizza 50 minutes after being seated it was totally burnt. Awful experience.  Do not recommend this place at all.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1518375097194< /Date><Rate>2< /Rate><Review>Food was good, but service was terrible. We had called in a reservation, but when we arrived they said they didn't have it. Saw it on a note next to their phone with all the details and called them out on it. They didn't care.

Waited 45 mins for a table, then nearly 30 mins for a starter salad. When questioned about the salad after about 20 mins, our server gave a snarky reply that they have to cook the chicken on the salad, so it's not a 15 minute salad. Mmkay. Another 15 mins or so for food to start coming in waves.

One of the dishes that was supposed to be vegetarian showed up with sausage or ground beef in it. When we meet the server know, she didn't apologize and say let me go fix that for you. Instead she argued that it shouldn't have meat in it (obviously it shouldn't based on the menu description). She did get it remade quickly, and it was good, but she really needs to work on her customer service skills.

It's really a shame that the service was so bad here. What should have been a great family get together, was turned into a frustrating experience. Again, we all enjoyed our food, but I definitely won't be back next time I'm in town.<//Review>< pics>

However, this is the filthiest restaurant we have been in for a long time. 2 of the 4 plates on the table looked like they literally hadn't been washed. Ok, that happens. There was food in various spots all over the floor, and a crayon. The tables all looked like they were wiped with a dirty rag. We were there at 3:30 on Sat afternoon 7-12, and one of only three tables being served, so it's not like it was in the midst of a meal rush, and nobody had time to push a broom for 5 minutes. We kept waiting to see if a server would at least pick up the crayon so they would slip on it. Nope. Two people with a $50 before tip lunch tab-sorry, but I'd rather eat somewhere with a cleanliness standard. Back to Blue Ribbon Pizza in Encinitas now, for our pizza fix. Or Leucadia pizza. Wish people took pride in their establishments-we were hoping it would be good, but pretty disappointed.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>My time spent inside "Crust" was less than 5 minutes. I simply picked up a pizza to go.  I inhaled the environment of "Crust" in those few minutes.

The 5 stars I gave was 95 percent for the pizza and 5 percent for my short experience inside and over the phone ordering.

If your a serious pizza lover that appreciates quality and taste, this place is top tier for you.  Traveling often for business I get around the US and can tell you "Crust" is in the top 10 percent. (Been to NY and Chicago, interesting enough, and never had time to get pizza)

I created my own pizza.
I had a 10" pizza with Artisan crust (regular), Wisconsin mozzarella cheese, Portobello mushrooms, black olives and onions. My total was 14.85 and that was for two people. No complaints, your getting quality.  First and final opinion is this place has great pizza.  The only local pizza equal is "Marco's" in Vista, CA.

I will come here again, and I live in San Marcos 6 miles away.

The environment inside made me think i was inside"Chipotle" with servers and a bar added. That is not saying a bad thing. I am just  describing the inside as best I can. Wide beer and wine selection.  I interacted with three employees and they were all friendly. Others will probably disagree, but I PERSONALLY would not go there with a group bigger than 6. Customer service over the phone for the order was great. Plenty of parking.

Pizzaholic tourists getting the "shakes" should definitely go here if in Carlsbad, CA.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Excellent group of massage therapists here, with the exception of one. I come a lot and find it easy to book an appointment at the last minute- a huge help with my work schedule.<//review>

It's a great place and well worth the price. A few things to note... They could tidy up a bit and do a thorough cleaning. And they need to bleach their towels. They go sour very quickly. Other than that, it's great. Very nice staff.</text>

Extremely well maintained and clean. The front desk guys and I believe ' the owner' have been friendly and welcoming.
It is a small spa and has a good attendance. Not to overpacked during 'peak' times.
My last visit found the steam room being redone so it is Currently out of service.</review>

<text>I started going to this place when it first opened. It wasn’t bad for a $10 entry but they have since change the price twice since then & honestly for $18 this place isn’t worth it. I’ve been to bigger better spas for the same price</text><rate>1</rate>< pics>

Photos didn't match the place. Sauna didn't work, regulars said it's a usual problem.  Hour late on Massage,  relief person seemed like it was not his usual position.<//Review>

first of all, the Japanese massage guy was no longer there!
he was amazing in every aspect like great skills, professionalism, personality, very attractive guy indeed...I miss him..where did he go?
and massage was instead performed by an elder Korean masseur/scrubber...the music he was playing was boring same melody over and over drove me nuts
and massage itself was mediocre at best..oh and while scrubbing my body( I requested body scrub in advance without knowing the Japanese guy was gone already...I should've asked first..) he unnaturally touched/rubbed hard my private part even on my prone position by sliding his hands underneath between my legs(yikes) which was totally unnecessary
and felt violated..and on my spine position..again kept touching the part as if he was trying to achieve something else ...NO THANKS!

now this place became really sketchy place consists of unattractive creepy masseur/scrubber ...two thumbs down
oh, also this time as everyone else mentioned here, the Latino receptionist
had very rude and unwelcoming attitude..this place's literally going down the hill now....NEVER AGAIN.

going back to Riviera spa or Seoul health spa.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Reasonably priced and clean. The main Mark against it is that the cold pool was tepid, which was a bummer on a hot day. It's been cold in the past.< /Text>< user>

I just Stopped by there on Wednesday afternoon-ish when I drove back to South Bay from near Mexico and the place was cozy, peaceful, down to earth vibe, clean and  dry/steam sauna and Jacuzzi Were nice. I didn't use bio rooms, warm room etc...thus can't comment on that.
I was so tired from driving, stress from work etc ..requested 1 hour massage (their rate was so reasonable compare to other Spa /massage places) and Never regretted.
The massage guy was an Asian, he was nice, very professional & very easy on the eyes...his skill was phenomenal, satisfying and very soothing/relaxing session made me feel refreshed afterwards. If you expect some kinda happy ending/sexual services from the massage guy, keep looking elsewhere. All he does is just giving the superb massage & I'm totally fine with it. next time I go to the area, I'll stop by this place again just to get a massage from him.
Enjoyed this place much better than other Korean style Spas I visited before in whole LA area.< /text>

<Text>Came in for a replacement of Custom LED headlights and LED turn signal lights for my 09 Jeep Wrangler. Whoever owned the car before me really messed up the wiring. But Isaac was extremely helpful and was able to fix everything. I am 7 months pregnant and the waiting room was super comfortable for me, even though I waited barely an hour only. Extremely pleased with the professionalism of Delta Auto Electric. I will be referring my friends and family to this shop for sure. & I will definitely be back! Thank you so much Isaac!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dbf4be2cede307:0x3c017cd763cca6ad</Gmap_id><rating>5< /rating><userid>115942506770392965242<//userid></record></dataset><record>

We had a wonderful experience having our vehicle repaired by Delta Auto Electric. The owner was very professional and eased our worries about leaving our vehicle overnight. I am so glad we had the service that we did. I will definitely come back if needed and/or refer others who require the same work we did! Thank you!!< /Text>

<review>After a terrible experience with an Auto Electric shop in Mira Mesa, I let my poor car sit in the driveway for 3 whole years. After ruining another brand new battery, I finally started researching where to take my SUV for both electrical and mechanical work near by.
We brought the car in to Delta Electric in Escondido after hearing all good things about this shop and it's mechanics.
Wow! What a great experience I had with Issac, the owner, who turned my dreaded auto repair into a positive experience.
Not only did Issac call and explain each problem that had occurred, he also wanted to be sure that I understood the issues while giving me affordable options!
I immediately knew I had chosen the exact right shop and mechanic to get our car in tip top shape.
His labor was reasonable and he took the time to itemize the invoice for our future reference.
Lastly, Issac even offered to take the car to be smogged knowing it was behind on the registration.
I chose to leave nothing unattended (right down to the windshield wipers) and now the car runs like a brand new car, straight off the assembly line!
My whole family is so pleased and we will be recommending him to everyone we know!
Seriously, what a pleasure it was to work with this man, and now I'm one of the lucky ones who has a trusted mechanic!!!< /review>< response>

< Review>
I brought in my 95 Silverado, with a no start problem. Prior to bringing it to Delta the truck was in limp mode due to a voltage problem somewhere in the truck. I had taken it to another shop before and they had it for a week and the problem got worse, not better, causing me to tow it from there to Delta. Upon moving the truck to Delta Issac gave me an overview of what he was going to do to diagnose it and then kept me informed of what he found and what needed to be done to fix it, as well as the cost. He had the no start issue and the limp mode issue identified in short order. He then got the parts and the installed them and I had my truck back and working within 24hours.

THANKS Issac!!!

Sincerely, James< /Review>

This place is fantastic. Blower went out on my 2012 ford fusion and he had it up and running in no time! Even managed to save me a bit of money on the parts I needed! Would highly recommend coming here if you have an electrical problem with your car! He'll take care of you!<//Review>

Had a great experience at Delta. Manny was on time, very communicative. He kept me informed at all times while working on my Nissan Altima. He made sure I was comfortable while I waited for my car to be repaired. Overall diagnosis and repair of my car was pretty straightforward. Price was of great value! He did an amazing job! I definitely recommend this place. Great job!</review>

Hands down best overall service I have ever received! I loved how Junior let me know everything and anything about my car and they didn't try to nickel and dime me for everything. He kept in contact with me with cost and how long everything was going to take. He even waited for me after the shop closed so I can come and pickup my car this was even around Christmas time. I'm definitely going to keep there information.<//Review>

Someone you can rely on to keep the communication open and keep you updated every step of the way while your car is getting worked on? Then come to Delta Auto Electric! Issac is someone you can trust with your newborn child. I love that this is a pop and son shop. What I really loved loved was that Issac called/ texted every step of the way to make sure I understood what was going wrong with my car. Not only did he keep me updated but he was able to fix multiple things and got my car up and running again in less than i day! Don’t think about going anywhere else, this is the shop to check out if your check engine light is on, or if you have any electrical issues. Issac you the man!< /Text>< gmap_id>

I have taken my 2002 GMC Envoy to Delta Auto  Electric twice in the last 2 years for unrelated issues. I had such a positive experience the first repair that I immediately sought them out again when I had another electric issue. They sought out parts from a salvage yard, instead of simply quoting me for new parts. I very much appreciated this extra step and time they took to save me money. Their work is Top Notch and very professional. I highly recommend them for your car electric woes. Thank You, Issac and Manny!</review>

<Review>Was having some grinding noisies going on with my car. I’m not too familiar with car problems but I knew I had to get something done. I had several people recommend me to Isaac at delta auto and I couldn’t have had a better experience. He walked me through the problem and what we needed to do to fix it. One of the best experiences I’ve had with mechanics. No headaches, just solutions. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a stress-free straightforward fix to your car!<//Review>< pics>

Got referred to Issac by a family friend. Very professional and gave me a breakdown on the process and time it could take to fix my car. He called and kept me updated throughout the process the entire time and if anything needed to be bought or done, he would call to get my approval. Highly recommend and will definitely refer him to others. Thank you, Issac!</review>

< Review>
My number #1 shop for trusted technicians. I've been going to Delta for more than 10 years and have never been disappointed. Great customer service with Manny And his son Isaac. Not only do they find the problem, they go above and beyond to make sure the problem is corrected and nothing else was damaged due to the problem.

From wiring harnesses to check engine lights these guys do it all. Highly recommended them if you need good quality service with the right results.

Having electrical issues and your dealer can't find the problem, go to Delta. Dealers do.</Review>

< Review>
Fantastic service and staff. Spoke to a very nice young man named Isaac, he listened to my concerns and took very careful note of the problems I was experiencing with my 2014 Honda Accord. He quickly diagnosed and found the problem with my car. I showed up at the shop right when they opened at 8:30am waited in their very clean lounge like waiting area and was out the door by 9:40am. Excellent service extremely fair pricing and best of all it was fast service which is fantastic as I had to go back to work. Thank you very much Delta Auto Electric I will be back with out a doubt for my car needs.</Review>

< Review>
Excellent place for auto electric service.  Friendly, knowledgeable, and actually care about solving the problem.  Issac always followed up on all work.  Found a very elusive problem with my Jeep Wrangler and got it fixed.  Several Poway auto electric places failed miserably with the diagnosis of the problem and charged for unnecessary work.  Result, replaced a badly broken flex plate that made Jeep virtually inoperable for two months and now works like new.< /Review>

<text>Today, I went in for my 3D scan because I wasn’t confident in doing the “at-home” impressions kit. I was assisted by Anthony whom was amazing!!! He was super patient with me (and all my questions) and took his time to explain everything to me in detail. Anthony was very knowledgeable and listened to all my concerns.

With so many different aligner companies on the market, I’m so glad I chose Smile Direct. So far, my experience has been great. Can’t wait to receive my retainers in the mail!!!!< /text>< GmapID>

<review>Kathy was so awesome. She is very knowledgeable and thoroughly explained the entire process to me. She was very friendly and genuinely cared about my concerns. She was never pushy and did not try to pressure me to enroll in the program. I am currently researching and am considering all my options. So far, this seems like my best choice (especially for the price). I would recommend a visit to at least check out the product. I even told my sister to check out their location in San Diego.< /review><resp>{'time': 1619793664399, 'text': 'Andrea, thank you so much for the positive review!

5 star 🌟 location and service ... quick and easy to locate free parking and easy access. The storefront was great very clean. People were attentive it wasn’t that busy, it was a quick in and out process. The front desk people answered all my inquiry. Maritza was the associate assigned to me - she was very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. Maritza explained everything and out you at ease about the whole process. Kudos to the team and Maritza. Hope the results will be as great as the team in the BH store. Thanks 😊</review>

<text>I came into the Beverly Hills location not knowing what to expect. But I have to say I was thoroughly impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of our consultant. Christine was kind, friendly, and personable. We had an amazing experience learning all about how the Smile Direct aligners work and viewing the 3-D scans. It was actually really fun! Christine took the time to answer all of my many questions and really went above and beyond to make this an enjoyable experience for me and my daughter. We are so excited to receive our aligners and start this journey! Christine is THE BEST!< /text>< Date>

There's that type of friendly and informed service that makes the customer experience enjoyable. Then there are the rare few that go beyond that. Who actually talk to you like they would their friend, that chat with you because they are truly interested in hearing about the person you are. That's the kind of service I got here. The kind of service that's really rare. The kind that turns around a bad day. These guys really are living up to the good ol' phrase of "turning that frown upside down". ;) Thanks, Kathy, for your genuine personality and solid product knowledge.</text>

She is very knowledgeable and made me very comfortable as he walked me through everything. She answered every and all my questions and I left feeling excited and confident in the process! There was no rush, and she pointed out some small details I would have not noticed. Highly recommended.< /review>

<Text>Went today for my in person visit. Had a 1oclock appointment.

I was assisted by Kathy.
The customer service here is really great.
I went in hesitant about getting the aligners.
Kathy made me feel very comfortable and taken care of. Everyone else who I spoke with (sorry, forgot the names. Ali I believe is her name, also assisted me)
The process was smooth and straight forward.
They answered all the questions I had and made me feel confident about getting them.
Customer service is so important to me so Kathy and Ali really went above and beyond.
I ended up calling them an hour later and purchasing them. (I didn’t have my card when I went)
I feel great about my decision and I’m so excited to start this journey and get my aligners!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1615454762609, 'text': 'Steph, we are so happy to read such a great review about SmileDirectClub!'}</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bda158ffeacf:0xe8604d5f02267247<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Jean-Paul Barjon<//user_name><Review>This was a very unexpectedly FANTASTIC experience (the free parking was great too). From the moment I was greeted to the having the door held for me as I left by my alignment specialist, Mike, this place blew me away with their customer service! Everyone I encountered was incredibly pleasant, understanding, detailed in their explanations, and accommodating. Mike made sure I was comfortable with the entire exam, and gave me the confidence that my decision was definitely going to be a good one. People’s attitudes can really affect your buying experience, and I know this from selling cars in the past. The enthusiasm and positive energy from this entire staff put me at so much ease spending this kind of money on myself. If the alignment results are as good as the customer service, I’m going to have the best smile in the world!! Thanks, Mike and the rest of the crew!<//Review><time>1612484875865</time><gmapID>0x80c2bda158ffeacf:0xe8604d5f02267247< /gmapID></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I made an appointment online and was so impressed when I came in. There is free parking just a few shops down in a structure. Street parking can be limited here. I was fortunate to be helped by Summer who was warm, made me feel comfortable, and ensured I understood every step. She answered every question and was able to ensure that I felt safe. I was particularly impressed by the Covid safety protocols. While I was there, I observed the staff sanitize all surfaces touched and staff switch out gloves multiple times. Additionally, the layout of the office allowed for ample space and made social distancing the default. I would highly recommend this place and Summer in particular.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

From start to finish, Smile Direct (B. Hills) couldn’t of been any easier. In and out in a jiffy, but not rushed. Every last question was answered, everyone was SUPER friendly, and the price was soooooo much cheaper than I thought. Special extra shout out to Christine, who was incredibly sweet and caring with my kiddo. Can’t wait to get her aligners in the mail and get started! PS - Parking was free (no validation needed) and 100 feet from the Smile Direct office.<//text>

I had the best experience at Smile Direct Club and it was all thanks to Mike! From the moment I walked in he was super friendly, professional, and extremely helpful. He guided me through every step of the Smile Direct Club process and constantly reassured I was comfortable throughout the 3D scan. I couldn't recommend him enough! Thanks for making my visit so memorable Mike! Looking forward to getting my dream smile!< /review>

<Review>Smile Direct Club, it’s amazing!. After making an appointment online, I went for my consultation 3D scan etc. I had the best experience, all the staff were friendly, polite, professional and helpful. Big thanks to Christine for making me feel comfortable, enjoyable conversation, explaining me the process and answering all the questions that I had. This place was extremely clean and sanitize following all the Covid-19 guidelines. I signed up for the treatment to improve my teeth appearance and obviously my smile. I totally recommend this place if you’re looking to improve yours. Thank you smile direct club for everything! I hope to see you soon with a new smile :).</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1610124545720, 'text': 'Hey Louislian, thank you for sharing this feedback!

While getting scanned it was a very pleasant experience, there was no tugging on my lips or over stretching my gums. if you every want to get aligners and excellent customer service please go to Smile Direct in Beverly Hills CA!

Such a great experience! If you’re interested in achieving a smile that boosts your confidence and helps you be your best self, than this is where you want to go! Upon arrival I was promptly greeted by a very nice woman, although I forget her name, I believe she was the manager. She assisted me with the check in process & let me know that they were a little busy but they’d get to me asap. When it was my turn and I was introduced to my smart smile tech Yaritza, between her and the manager, they were able to make the wait time disappear with their Quality customer service. They were both very personable as well as knowledgeable regarding the entire process, which put me at ease and allowed me to really enjoy myself! Although this was a Christmas present given to me, if you can afford this and are contemplating the decision I highly recommend that you do! And if you’re near Beverly Hills, definitely head over to the 321 N Beverly Dr. location, you won’t be disappointed. Thanks again smart smile club Beverly Hills for everything!</review>

First off let me say- if you have any doubts about getting a beautiful smile, doubt no more! This place is amazing! Everything from cleanliness, to location, to the amazing staff, my experience was 5 star! I had a wonderful young gentlemen named Mike, helping me with my consult. He was so personable and friendly, he just made the whole process so smooth and it went by so fast. My only disappointment was that the appt went too fast, I wanted more time with Mike hehe! We talked about what brought me in, what I was looking for and my goals, and he totally made me feel right at home. He is the guy to see, if you’re going to go into this location. I’m sure the other reps are great, but I got lucky with Mike. I can’t wait to see how my smile turns out after everything is said and done. It was a little on the pricey side but considering what your getting and for no office visits (everything minus consult and maybe a follow up appt), you can’t beat that! Dental treatment right from home! Thank you Smile Direct Club! You most definitely made me smile today!</text>

Amazing place if you want to scan and straighten your teeth. Yaritza is such a sweetheart. Gave a top service. I didn’t do my teeth this time, but did the scan and I received teeth whitened kit. Thank you Smile Direct Club. ❤️ 🙏<//Review>

<Review>I recommend anyone that see’s this review PLEASE, walk away from smile direct club. They say in their contract, that instead of correcting your smile, they push teeth out to push them together. The danger of doing so will give you buck teeth or give you an over bite. Now my friend is in debt to smile direct club and they COULDN’T EVEN CORRECT THEY’RE SMILE FOR THEM. I would give them zero stars if I could. God be with anyone that has dealt with this corrupt company.< /Review>< pictures>

I took my Husband to smile direct club in Beverly Hills because he wanted to fix his smile. We where greeted by the receptionist who was very kind and sweet to us. She informed us We were going to be helped by YANET. We waited probably around 3-5 min before getting in the consultation room. YANET came to greet us in the lobby and then took us to the consultation room where she was very kind and sweet she made us feel so comfortable during the whole consultation. She was extremely knowledgeable and answered every question and concerns with had. She explained every single step from beginning to end. We were extremely pleased with the consultation.</Review>

Today I had the best experience walking into Smile Direct it was my first time going and I was a bit nervous and didn't know what to expect but all that went away as soon as I walked in the door. I was greeted by Yaritza and the staff they were super friendly but specially Yaritza she was in charge of my case and im glad she was. Yaritza was very friendly, she was understanding and compationate towards my needs, incredibly kind, she radiates positivity, she's extremely professional but at the same time I felt like i was talking to a friend, she was very caring and she made sure I was informed about everything and ultimately made me feel right at home thanks Yaritza you gave me hope 😊 . PLEASE GIVE HER A RAISE !!! To everyone needing braces please visit smile direct you won't regret it 👍< /Text>

All of the staff were super nice and inviting. The appointment itself went off without any issues. I was 10 minutes late and they were still able to accommodate me as soon as I arrived. The front hostess was very knowledgeable and shared with me her experience with using Smile Direct Club. Then I was handed off to a gentlemen named Mike, who informed me a bit more of the products included with the smile direct aligner purchase. He was very nice and made the appointment very pleasant. I also felt very safe with their precaution procedures to deal with COVID. The entire office was spotless! All items used to take my smile photos were individually wrapped and administered directly from packaging or were given to me to handle. Mike himself wore gloves the entire time, a mask and face shield. Once we were done he took off his gloves and put on a hefty amount of hand sanitizer and gave me some as well. It was honestly super easy, no fuss!<//Text>

This staff is amazing to say the least. I was welcomed with (not to be corny) but so many smiles from the staff here. The place is doing very well with keeping the areas clean and sanitary. My dentist assistant Yanet was such a joy and answered all my questions with extreme professionalism and helped me feel confident about my journey that I am about to take! Shout out to her for doing a great job.< /Review>

My first week in, and I'm using the Nighttime Aligners.  They are so easy and convenient to use, I am loving it!  Not to mention the HUGE cost savings, yet I still get great support from a teeth specialist with a quick phone call.  Paired with the Smile Spa cleaner, maintenance is a breeze.  😁< /text>< pictures>

<Text>The experience at the shop is amazing, but the purchase process is anything but that.  Smile Direct Club sent me a promo for $175 off a single payment option.  They failed to mention that you have to choose between the promo OR using insurance.   How does that even make sense.  Insurance is not a promotion.  Its a benefit I already pay for.  The chat representative stated there was nothing they can do.  I was ready to join the club with my payment.   You need to update your processes, as you have lost my business.< /Text>< UserId.>

Absolutely hated the their services. I paid for the entirety of my sets to be sent to me, I had to call periodically to remind them as they sent them to me 4 sets at a time. Never got the last set, was told to go in to one of their offices (what’s the point of the whole process if I could have just went to an office?) due to the time lapse, they made me pay an additional 30 for them to sent the impressions, promised to arrive 2-3 days. It now shows that it will be delayed up to 2 weeks. No resolution whatsoever. Every call I try to be nice and patient, but all that’s gotten me is them running me over and me apologizing. They make mistakes and expect me to be patient and pay additional fees? Not an ethical or just business. They have many competitors I would strongly suggest you go with them.< /Review>

She made me laugh and feel very comfortable while explaining the process of how everything works. I’m excitedly for this and seems like a great place to help fix my smile.

When i got there Mike helped me from begining to end.
He was very friendly and explained to me the entire process , told me the contents of the package i was going to recive and how to use and care for the aligners.
Very impressed with their amaizing service and how easy it was .
Thank you Mike for all the help !!!

<rate>1< /rate><Review>NEVER USE SMILE DIRECT!! IF I could give smile direct less than a star I would. I visited this shop July 28th to do a scan and show the "dentak team" that after 2+ years of doing this treatment IT DOES NOT WORK. I clearly told the girl that did the scan I wanted to cancel this treatment and a refund of my money and to please inform the dental team about this issue. She said not to worry, that she will inform her superiors about this issue.

Few days later, I recieved an email from Smile Direct indicating that I have to pay an extra $100 for my new aligners to continue the treatment. Completely ignoring my initial petition and charging me with more money.

I have been in this treatment since 2018 and they told me it will only last 6 months and it's been more than 2 years. I have been extremely patient. But it has been the worst service ever, I have contacted Smile Direct numerous times to fix this issue and they simply don't reply to any emails or calls. It has been the worst decision and waste of time. It has been a month since I got my appointment and still have no update or answer and they keep charging me.

Based on my experience I would NEVER RECOMMEND smile direct, they over promise and under deliver, the customer service to solve any inconvenience or issue is so bad. A lack of organization, structure, honesty and transparency.

After 2 years still waiting to solve my case and NOBODY shows up.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>We are so impressed by the whole set up at Smile Direct. It was easy to make an in person visit which we preferred. We then received emails confirming our appointment and what to expect. We were greeted by Aly, who was personable, caring, authentic and absolutely lovely. She has the best personality and made us feel welcome. She answered all of our questions which we really appreciated and was very patient and supportive of all our concerns. We were then lead to a private room where Katherine was our personal technician and she was very pleasant and professional, making us feel well taken care of. They were all  aware of the correct COVID protocols, which made us feel safe. Thank you Aly and Katherine for the best experience one could wish for at SmileDirect!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1614357467975, 'text': 'This means so much to us, Susan!

<review>It was one of the best experiences for me. I personally am a really shy smiler, and I love the fact that Gabby was able to make me comfortable enough to show my smile. She assured me that it could be fixed and that they would do everything they can to make me have a great smile that I would be comfortable with. I definitely recommend to anyone who is seriously thinking about getting Invisaligners!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1598972619132, 'text': 'This means so much to us!

This place is awesome.  No questions asked. Great customer service and nice office. I had the pleasure of having Mike and Aly to help me through my process of getting a rescan so I can get my smile perfect. They were both great and I give them a 10 star rating. A 5 star rating is too low for the professionalism they provide. If you are looking to smile with confidence, I recommend smiledirect. Thanks again Mike and Aly you guys keep on bringing those smiles to the community. 🙂<//review>

My smile guide was Gabby and she was really great telling me the whole process and made my experience really great. It only took a few minutes to do the scan and she gave me a goodie bag after we were done. Everyone was super nice and friendly there, 100% would recommend.< /review>

<Text>Gabby was beyond dope, I'm awkward and ya she handled everything with such grace and finesse. She's got people skills, rare commodity. Exciting about smiling more direct, and forthright. Sincerely, thank you.

PS. Cornelius was ebullient the duration of my experience, top management material written all over him. Hopefully the smile people read these things, so they know what they have.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<pics>None</pics><review>I was happy with Smile Direct Club until my treatment plan was done.  When my treatment plan was done I saw that all my teeth hadn’t fully straightened so I was told about the touch up aligners that was included in my treatment plan.  I made an appt at the Beverly Hills location.  The appt went smoothly but the rep who helped me told me I would receive my additional aligners in 3 weeks (mostly likely 2 weeks but they say 3 weeks to be safe).  So almost 2 weeks after my appt I haven’t received an email stating my aligners had shipped so I check the status and it says my aligners will ship in 4-5 weeks.  I call customer service and am told the same information.  So the Beverly Hills location tells me I will RECEIVE my aligners in 3 weeks but 2 weeks after my appt I’m told it’s still another 4-5 weeks before my aligners will ship.  I don’t know if the Beverly Hills location tells customer false timeframes but this is unacceptable.  So when I’m told 3 weeks from the location it’s really 6 weeks before I get my aligners.  I will NOT be referring Smile Direct Club to anyone.< /review><userid>108937264999549073768</userid><date>1612805993876</date></record></dataset><record>

The staff super friendly and make you comfortable being there i was helped by Cornelius and Mike they were amazing they talked very politely and like a friend yet professional. They explained the whole process very clearly and answered any questions I had. The place itself was very clean specially now during covid-19. I had the scan taken instead of the impression kit very simple and fast. I was given free whitening kit to take home, a smile direct tote bag, and was told i would receive a $25 amazon card emailed to me. Would recommend coming here<//text>

<name>Anne McLaughlin<//name><text>I scheduled an appointment at the Beverly Hills Smile Shop first thing Wednesday morning. The scheduling process was super easy and I even got a reminder text and email. When I walked in I was helped right away by the friendly and professional staff. I only had to wait about 2 minutes to be seen and in that time, another friendly associate chatted with me while I waited. The entire team was great, but I lucked out and had my consult with Yartiza, who did an AMAZING job with my consult and talked through all of my questions (and I had a lot!) everything from results to billing to comparing to other brands- she knew it all! When i left the consult I was 95% sure I would go with SDC but I needed to mull it over for a just a little bit (plus I had an appointment scheduled to see Candid Co later that week to compare). But after thinking about it for a few hours I knew SDC was the way to go- Yaritza made me feel I would be well taken care of every step of the way and the SDC doors would 'always be open' for me. Yaritza definitely went ABOVE AND BEYOND yesterday and made me feel confident that SDC was the right choice (and the price and financing options were great, as well!) THANK YOU YARITZA!!<//text>< Gmap_id>

I was a little late for my appointment and considering I was the last appointment of the day before closing I felt so bad making everyone wait because of me. (Sorry guys!) Anesha was super chill, and kind with the most fabulous lashes, ask for her you can't miss her! She was so patient with me and answered all my questions. She shared some of her tips and tricks and was super helpful. I was skeptical about the whole thing but I was convinced and I'm super excited for my new smile :) Thanks Anesha!<//Text>

Personnel was super polite and careful. In Pandemia's times they do care about health security measures that is great so you don't have to care about more things. But be aware of the traffic of the area. This is a commercial zone, even with parking instructions park is gonna be difficult. Take your time and try to be there 15 minutes earlier. ( To Park not to the appointment) be punctual is very important so you will have the minimum contact or no contact with next patient.</Text>

I don't usually write reviews, bad ones especially, but I feel the need to let people that this place is such a scam. Once you sign up, they won't care about you anymore. My teeth have shifted but all in the wrong direction. I still have the same problems with my teeth as I did before. They have sent me to do an eval TWICE. and no follow up for either of them. I had to personally call them to make sure they're processing my aligners. Also, no emails either for any sort of update. There's no organization or communication with the whole company. This company is ridiculous. I wish I read the reviews before I signed up. Just an overall unpleasant experience.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Mike the Manager is wonderful, Using the latest technology, no more gross impressions at the dentist, they get a fast and easy picture of your mouth. Super Cool.</review>

Juan was amazing. He greeted me and helped my boyfriend and I with such professionalism, ease, and leadership that I thought he was the manager. Someone should give him a promotion! Will definitely be recommending this place. Their services are world class.</review>

<time>1610118993695</time><rate>1</rate><Review>The representative Yaritza was nice but a horrible customer service and  smile guide.

I asked her several times to slow her speech so I could understand what  she was saying.. she apologized and kept talking fast..I just gave up and let her ramble....she talked continously at 95 miles per hour  as she was about to do the scan.

.Her unfamiliar accent  was terrible and on top of that her mask and shield made it worse ( even though I appreciated her wearing it).

I left Smile Direct Club in  Beverly Hills California  understanding very little of what the heck she said.
Most of all I was just glad to get out of her cubicle . Both my daughter and I left with such a headache from listening to her foreign rambling of unidentified words  and high pitch  tones our splitting headaches lasted through the evening and I rarely if ever get headaches.

Smile Direct Club really need to make sure their Smile Guides can speak good English, explain things clesrly and that they can communicate with clarity and don't have a problem of talking too fast.  If their other representatives (who were all busy as well) are like tnis...I would not recommend Smile Direct  Club.
.I was not taken care of  by Yaritza, ....and at Direct Club.. if Smiling is contagious neither me or my daughter never got  it..we left with a contagious headache with Yaritza written all over it....
A horrible first time experience!!!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

First off, location wise was beautiful! Such a clean, crisp location right in the heart of Beverly Hills. It was super easy to find and parking was free! I was greeted immediately upon entering the shop by Yessica who was absolutely PHENOMENAL. If there was a spokeswoman for customer service, it would 100% be Yessica. She was so helpful, friendly, informative—any questions I had she answered them with extensive knowledge and enthusiasm! I’m so happy that I’m starting treatment and that my experience went over so well! This is such a better experience than going through my dentist.

< review>
Anesha and Correlius at the Beverly Hills location were so wonderful. I have been dead set on veneers for quite some time but I wanted to look at all my options before committing. My roommate used Smile Direct so I made an appointment to check it out. I wasn’t even sure I was going to purchase, but after my experience today I purchased and am very excited. It’s a simple process and I am excited to correct and whiten my natural teeth, also at a much more affordable price. I look forward to this journey to my best smile!!!</review>

<text>Gabe and Yaritza were absolutely amazing today!
Excellent customer service.  When I first walked in to Smile Direct Club, I was Greeted by the front desk rep, who was
Super Nice and Friendly.  Then She introduced me to
Gabe and he answered any questions that I had about
the aligners and made me feel at ease.  He is so easy
to talk,  I Feel like I have a new BFF now.
Yaritza was also Super informative and did my scan
perfectly.  She made sure that I get to see everything
That would come in my kit and we agreed on the things that I was able to see on the scan concerning the areas
Of my teeth that I would like to fix.

Both, Gabe and Yaritza, were just awesome and I would totally recommend Smile Direct, Beverly Hills to anyone.  You all were so Sweet and I really feel like I made the right choice on
opting to choose Smile Direct Club to help me reach
my goals.< /text></record>

<text>Great Experience at the Beverly Hills location! Everyone was so friendly and helpful, especially Anesha who assisted me. The whole process took maybe 30 mins, no impressions needed to be taken, just some digital scans of your teeth and a few pictures. Quick and painless. She was also able to answer all my additional questions.  Highly recommend this location and Smile Direct Club!</text>< Pictures>

Just left the Smile Direct Club in Beverly Hills and I honestly couldn’t be happier. I normally don’t write reviews just read them but I felt I had to share how great the staff was. From the moment I walked in I was treated kindly by Cornelius who took all proper precautions regarding safety in these hard times due to COVID-19, which made me feel more comfortable about being in a dental office. I waited no more than 3 minutes before I was attended by Mike who was very professional and gave me all the information I needed regarding my smile journey. Mike made me feel very comfortable as he went over everything regarding the program and I honestly can’t wait for it. I was asked what rating I would give mike between 1-5 and he deserves a 10 he was amazing and I felt like I was with a friend. I definitely recommend the Smile Direct Club of Beverly Hills.</review>

<Text>I went to the one in Beverly Hills and was greeted right when I walked in. My appointment was with Cornelius who was very good at walking me through the steps and making sure I was comfortable during the 3D scan. I came to see if this was a perfect fit and get the pricing options. Cornelius didn't use sales pressure techniques and set me up easily to start the system in March. I ended up adding onto my promotional package to go ahead and start the whitening system. Highly recommend!< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Great in-store experience and everything was going well UNTIL the moment when, 2 days later, my credit card was charged for the full treatment amount, despite:

A. Having asked to have only the top half of my mouth treated and being assured by the assistant in store that I would receive at least $300 off the price because of this.

B. Being assured by the assistant that no charge would be made to my credit card until the doctor had reviewed my treatment and confirmed pricing.

After 2 phone calls to Smile Direct Club I have had this refunded. I have gained nothing from this experience and feel like my time was wasted.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1580495328023, 'text': 'Hi Sarah, thank you for providing us with this feedback.

<review>I really don’t like to add negativity or create negative comments especially during this time (COVID), but this Company put me in a really bad position when I was already in one. I found a Groupon that was $39 for $200 off of aligners. Great deal right? I have been wanting to get aligners for a while and finally got into a financially suitable position to support that. I looked up some reviews on smile direct and thought OK let’s give it a try! As soon as I scheduled my appointment, I did get great contact immediately. Upon my arrival, Gabby was The star of the show. She was very helpful, professional, down to earth and great to talk to. In other words, she’s far from the problem. I mentioned my Groupon twice before I signed any paperwork. She wasn’t sure what to do with the Groupon and neither was her manager. She took a picture of it, said she would make a note to my account and gave me a phone number to call to check on the status of the Groupon in a few days. Unfortunately, shortly after I got into a nasty car accident. I called as soon as I came to and got a hold of a representative. The representative gave me a lot of pushback and told me that the Groupon should’ve been added as soon as I made the purchase. I explained the situation but she still was being pushy about not giving the full credit of the groupon. Feeling unheard, I called back A second time, just to hear from the representative that this needed to be dealt with via email. I emailed the provided contact with pictures and proof and still got the same answer. Absolute refusal to add the Groupon that I cannot use in the future and has an expiration date. I emailed again to express my disappointment, and asked about the refund policy. The response was that someone would call in 5 to 7 business days. They never asked how we could work it out and No one ever called. On top of that, they never told me when my monthly payments would be taken out. So, their automatic payment put my account in an overdraft. Not exactly what I need when I’m not working during a pandemic after a car accident. Hopefully I’m not stuck in this agreement that I no longer want. I didn’t even mention the actual product itself. I’ve had braces before when I was a kid, I expect certain things to happen, but not once was it mentioned to me how sharp the plastic was, cutting into my teeth and my gums. It also left nasty marks and cuts on the inside of my mouth. The only thing they gave was a nail file to file down the edges (which has little to no effect). No wax or oral gels provided. My teeth feel sore (expected) and I sense they are moving. It’s a little hard to tell since it’s only been two weeks using them. I always want to work things out and give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this company just treated me like stamped cattle. If I could give zero stars, I would. The only thing holding up for me as far as smile direct is Gabby.</review><pics>None< /pics></record>

<Date>1601920478345<//Date><text>BEWARE: *I'm sure this place has great customer service, but I went to a different location* I did their program without consulting my dentist and y dentist was very upset and wish she had time to warn me of their credibility- which is almost non-existent in the medical field. She said I got LUCKY because I had braces previously and went a while without a retainer so I just needed a few months of adjustment that was going to be easy to fix. BUT if you've never had orthodontic care or need serious work, I'd go to an actual dentist/orthodontist who can actually look at your teeth in person. Also, I've been done with the program for almost a year and they NEVER STOP sending me these spam emails! I even got an email that I was due for another retainer and that they automatically charged my card and placed an order that I did not initiate or approve! How sketchy is that?! I called customer service to cancel and they told me there was NO order but they would cancel it anyway (what? which is it) and he'd send me an email confirmation (which I was very adamant about getting) and I never got the email confirmation. Wouldn't recommend them ever for any reason.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I went in last week about 30 minutes before my appointment and due to the previous patient being a no-show I was taken care of earlier. Joe was very informative and very welcoming. I appreciate the time he took to answer my questions along with explaining the details of the procedures done that day and thereafter.

He reassured me that there would always be a line of communication between myself and SDC. I look forward to receiving my aligners, thank you Joe for making this experience smooth and helpful. Hopefully, I'll convince my sisters to stop by as well. Thanks!

I appreciate the time he took to answer my questions along with explaining the details of the procedures done that day and thereafter.

He reassured me that there would always be a line of communication between myself and SDC. I look forward to receiving my aligners, thank you Joe for making this experience smooth and helpful. Hopefully, I'll convince my sisters to stop by as well. Thanks!

I went to the Beverly Hills store and was quite impressed. Both Raul and Cornelius were very informative and professional along with amazing hospitality. By treating your customers like they do you are more prone to keep and repeat happy customers. I am happy with my experience and even though I am looking at a couple places to make an informed and definite decision I’m acclimated to go with you because of the product and experience.< /Review>

I came to smile direct after a terrible experience with Assure Dental Culver City. After the many inconsistencies and changes, I just wanted to close a small space in my teeth. Immediately after leaving Assure Dental, I booked an appointment and arrived at Smile Direct THE SAME DAY! The lady who helped me was so sweet! She was very informative and helpful! I felt very comfortable making the decision to move forward with smile direct.< /text>

I had such a pleasant and easy experience at The Smile Direct Club in BH! I walked in early for my appointment and they saw me right away which was a pleasant surprise. The process of taking my scans could not have been easier or more informative. Everyone was a real delight and made me feel instantly comfortable. Would highly recommend!< /text>

When we were almost finished I met Cornelius, another friendly person all in all the service was amazing and the staff were great.

Juan and Raul were so awesome! Juan from the jump was very kind. He greeted me help me check in, he helped me create my account and he offered me a bottle of water. Both thoroughly Explained everything to me and my boyfriend. We asked a whole bunch of questions and they carefully explained each and every concern we had. They made us feel very comfortable. They definitely were a factor in why we chose to go through with smile direct club because not only were they very informative but they also were very kind and had a sense of humor. I would Encourage everyone to at least make an appointment and learn about how his process works and consider all your options. For us, smile direct club was the right option and we are very excited to receive our aligners! thank you Juan and Raul!!!!!<//Text>

********SCAM WARNING********

CORNELIUS HARRELL who works at this Smile Direct Club Beverly Hills is intentionally scamming Smile Direct Club customers in Beverly Hills everyday.

Please Read Review written by 1 of Cornelius Harrell scam and fraud victims, Yekaterina K. on Smile Direct Club Beverly Hills’ YELP.

This poor and innocent customer was tricked and lied to by Cornelius Harrell to sign a legal contract without going over its term and conditions or provide a full disclosure and promising her repeatedly she would not be charged when he intentionally knew upfront her bank account would be charged without her knowledge, her prior consent and against her will.

Cornelius Harrell continues to intentionally scam, cheat and harass the customers of Smile Direct Club in Beverly Hills, California, breaking all state laws prohibiting such employee from committing illegal acts and forbidden activities against the State of California, the City of Beverly Hills' residents, local and international visitors.

Unfortunately, Smile Direct Club has not acted yet to stop or terminate the employee or send a cease and desist letter to warn the employee to discontinue specified conduct, or take certain actions, by deadlines set in the letter, that party may be sued.

We are writing this review to warn all readers and customers to avoid any meeting and communication with Cornelius Harrell. To further prevent and protect them from falling as future victims to his intentional scams and daily fraud committed previously against the customers of Smile Direct Club in Beverly Hills.

We hope Beverly Hills’ Cops will soon arrest the lawless Cornelius Harrell to protect us from his illegal acts and misdemeanors against all.<//text>

i haven't tried the product yet, since I "just" went to my scan today. Anesha was so friendly, and when she did the scan, she was so gentle (thumb thumb thumb~~~).
I just have two things that I don't understand:
1. why I only saw my teeth image today? I thought I would see the image on the computer showing how my teeth might look like months later....
2. I used a $100 off code when i made an appt, but why I was not told I got that price today????
so very confused....
so the one star off was because these two doubts....< /text>

I am very pleased with the entire experience at Smile Direct Club in Beverly Hills! I walked in and was immediately greeted by Juan and Cornelius. They made me feel very comfortable and promptly began my consultation. We chatted and I felt like we were friends. I was impressed by how sleek and modern the office was. It was bright and clean with smaller personal spaces for the “exam”. I was expecting a typical dentist office and was pleasantly surprised to see a sleek and modern office space. The entire process was seamless and all of my questions were answered. I felt informed and prepared for the next step. The photo taking was quick too, five minutes. I was shocked to learn Cornelius was wearing his tray on the bottom. I did not even see it the whole time we were speaking. The hospitality was just outstanding and these two really related to me. I am excited for the next step in the process and to visit these two outstanding representatives in about six months. Thank you!</Text>

Anesha is the professional who helped me out for my visit, she was amazing at guiding me through the whole 3D scan, being informative and just being genuine during the whole process.

Cornelius was highly professional and tied the whole experience up into a full package of comfort of the process and how we were going to continue on fixing my grill lol

5 out of 5 and highly recommended anyone who has the chance to go into any of the SmileDirectClub offices to choose the Beverly Hills location.👌🏾< /Text>< Pics>

I was pleased with the service I received at this location, but not with SmileDirectClub itself.  They mistakenly sent me 5 months instead of 10 months of aligners.  Despite clear error on their part, would not send the remaining aligners necessary to complete my treatment.  Dealing with customer service was a nightmare.  It takes forever for anyone to respond to emails and two phone calls did not resolve the matter either.  If you have a problem you are on your own.  I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau to have the matter resolved since SmileDirectClub is unwilling to make it right.  Buyer beware.< /text>

<text>Cornelius was super sweet and personable. He and the dental expert -who was also very kind and helpful - explained why my concerns would not be best addressed by Smile Direct Club. It was a very educational and fun 15 minutes. They let me keep the whitening kit that was included in my promo too, which was nice. I can't say enough about the level of service and professionalism I witnessed from the team members in this short amount of time. I highly recommend the Beverly Hills location if you have concerns over straightening your teeth :-)< /text><Time>1563495070981</Time><resp>{'time': 1563560004620, 'text': 'Thanks so much for the review!

I left, (due to covid restrictions and space) while Anesha worked her magic on my son. I came in at the very end, Anesha answered all of our questions thoroughly. Now we wait for 3 days for full approval. The process was quick, easy, and friendly. All of what you hope any experience to be. Thank you Cornelius and Anesha!</Text>< pictures>

Buyer beware. Great brand promise, huge disappointment in delivering on that promise. I'm on my third series with Smile Direct Club, with huge delays in production and responsiveness between each updated set of trays, and lack of real customer service. Despite a very simple treatment plan to close a gap in my two front teeth (had braces as a teenager). You can't ever speak to a qualified dental person. It's clear the company cares more about making the sale/customer acquisition than actually fulfilling on existing customers.<//Text>

I had an amazing experience at the SmileDirectClub! Absolutely welcoming and professional staff. Their covid -19 preventative measures were 👍. My Smileguide Mike had me at hello 😉. Mike was very professional and explained the entire process in detail and helped me with any questions I had. SmileDirectClub has so far met and exceeded my expectations. Thank you Mike!!<//review>

<review>I was quite nervous going in since I assumed everything was too good to be true, but what a pleasant surprise! In this case I was happy to be proven wrong. I visited the shop in Beverly Hills and, truly, enjoyed myself immensely. I met with Sara and she was so kind and very helpful in the event of my questioning everything. She was also very polite in letting me know when she was going to touch my mouth during the 3D scan and made sure I was comfortable the entire time. The 3D Scan, by the way, was fascinating. I used to have braces so I was mentally preparing myself for a putty impression, but the universe was apparently lookin out for me. They use a device (that looks a bit like a flashlight) to map out your mouth. It takes 6000 pictures per second and you get to see the 3D map come into being on a screen in front of you in real time. Plus the scan was free! After talking about the different payment plans and being introduced to the box to be sent, I was sent home with a Bright On whitening kit and two lip balms, all free of charge! I apologize for rambling, but I’m actually very excited to get my first box and be a part of this process!!<//review>< userid>

<Text>The staff was very friendly and helpful. Appointment itself was easier than I expected and the 3D scan of your teeth is actually pretty cool. You’ll be in and out within 30 minutes. The pricing and perks are also hard to say no to. If you forget to bring chapstick to help with that mouth stretcher thing they use to take pictures of your smile (you don’t need to wear it while they do the scan)...no worries, they give you some and it’s in a cute round container.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bda158ffeacf:0xe8604d5f02267247</Gmap_id>< Pictures>

Anesha, was so awesome.  I absolutely enjoyed my visit at Smile Direct Club.  From the time Anesha’s greeting, until the time I finished with my visit she treated me so well.  Thank you so much!!!

The office is beautiful and immaculately clean with all the latest modernized equipment.  I had (zero wait time.). I was sitting in the dentist chair with the amazing professional representative. This is a world class office, with radiated positive energy and professional competency.

I literally had *fun* the entire time with Anesha.  Her confidence, her conversion make my experience quite pleasant.

Trust me if you want to change your life ask for Anesha when booking your appointment.  Once,
you arrive you will understand why.  If you want to receive a life changing event just stop you research and call Smile Diret Club.  You will be absolutely satisfied and this was on a Saturday morning.<//Text>

My experience at Smile Direct Club at Beverly Hills was great! Everyone working there is friendly and super helpful. Cornelius checked me in, and I had some questions about my insurance coverage which he helped. He even contacted my insurance to see if they would cover, unfortunately they did not but I really appreciated Cornelius for checking it for me. Then, I did my free 3D scan with Raul who explained the whole process to me and answered any questions I had. I just received my aligners and I can’t wait to have straight teeth!< /Review>

I just had my first visit with the smile direct club in Beverly Hills today. It was quite personable and I felt very comfortable. Shoutout to yaritza, she was patient and ready to help with any concerns or questions I may have as I am a rookie to this. Anyway, this is just the beginning and I can’t wait to see my new set of teeth :)< /text>

AMAZING EXPERIENCE! Ron and Juan went above and beyond to make our experience comfortable and enjoyable. They answered all of our questions, were extremely professional and genuine, and even gave me a whitening kit (the appointment was for my boyfriend). A1 service, A1 people! Give 'em raises, give 'em promotions!<//text>

Cornelius @ the Beverly Hills "Smile Shop" was very helpful and knowledgeable. He explained the process and steps it would take to get me the smile I desired. Definitely would recommend going to the Beverly Hills location and if possible, have Cornelius do your consultation.

Firstly I want to thank both Summer and Raul for taking me on such short notice after missing my appointment earlier that day due to traffic! The entire process from start to finish was so simple and amazing! I was talked through the entire way and had every question answered thoroughly! I’m so excited to start my journey with smile direct and build some confidence!
Thank you guys again for the laughs, chat, and expertise!</text>

From the moment I booked my free appointment to leaving their Beverly Hills shop, SmileDirect Club has me so excited to start my journey to a perfect smile! I have crowding in my front lower teeth but my top are straight, so I was always dreading the idea of years of wearing braces as an adult. But 6mos of invisible aligners on my bottom teeth sounds very do-able. After meeting up with my smileguide Raul, he explained to me the process, shared some laughs and also went over the easy payment plans. I can say I’m 100% ready to get myself on the path to a beautiful smile. Thank you for your outstanding help and customer service.< /Text>

<Review>I would have give 5 stars if only Cornelius approached me at first, unfortunately I was welcomed in a very unprofessional way from another one of the staff members, he didn’t seem to understand my questions and kept pressuring  me to purchase the alligners even before I had my scan done. He insisted that if I wasn’t ready to purchase them on the same day I should have not had the scan on that day, which would have been a total waste of time on my end to even drive there. As a buyer, I want to have the freedom to have a free consultation when offered, and why not take 24/48 hours before deciding to purchase, anything wrong with that? The answer is no, and I should not feel pressured from the stuff if that’s my desire.
After our disagreement he left me there hanging and started minding his business, joking with his colleagues and that was very irritating. THANK GOD CORNELIUS CAME! I was just about to leave and suddenly he took on my case and helped me through everything extremely friendly and professional, I didn’t feel uncomfortable ONE BIT with him and everything went perfect. I enjoyed our talk and how caring he was, he seemed interested in getting to know me before we went onto the scan and that was reassuring, I felt like a human being and not a number, which is great of course. From that point on I was treated like a king and everything was perfect. I am sorry for the misunderstanding with the first guy, but sometimes you just don’t vibe with people. Overall the visit was good and the personnel prepared. Thank you Cornelius for your expertise and care.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I'm so happy I went in today for a consultation! I met with Cornelius for the main orientation, and Raul for the pictures and scans. They were so kind and patient with me, answering all of my questions and providing me with all of the necessary information I needed to make an informed decision. The level of customer services was incredible, and the environment had a calm and comfortable energy. I recommend anyone who is questioning going in to not hesitate and have an awesome experience!<//Review>

I went Saturday, and I felt very welcomed by Sara. She greeted me when I got there and made sure I left with a smile. She explained everything to me and got me super excited for my box. I cannot stress it enough how Sara was amazing. She really had a positive attitude, always stopped to ask me if I had any questions and even offered me a water when she saw I was coughing. If you’re ever need of a brand new smile, make sure to ask for Sara! She’s the best!!!<//Text>

Had a great experience, Juan and Ron were both absolutely delightful and very helpful. The process to do the scan and sign up was quick and easy. My aligners took about a month to arrive. I'm on week 4 of using them and am already seeing results. Will be back soon for more chapstick. Thank you!</text>

<Review>Hesitant to visit an establishment that is not your typical dentist office. Decided to give it a shot and made my appointment online with Smile Direct. Very pleased to get an appointment right away! During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting their wonderful, Beverly Hills staff. Sara signed me in, she is such a sweetheart. Juan was my Smile Guide, he answered all my questions and made me feel very welcomed. He was extremely helpful and patient. I also love the fact that everyone is very personable, definitely did not expect that. Conrnilus topped off the experience by making sure i did not leave with unanswered questions or doubts. I cannot wait to get my kit!!</Review>< GmapID>

<name>AS< /name><Pics>None<//Pics><Time>1578441794810</Time><Review>The experience was similar to purchasing a used car.
The people who scanned my teeth pressured me to purchase as soon as the device left my mouth. They said the scan would take 72 hours to get to a dentist and then back to me. So in 3 days I'd be able to see the "after" of what my teeth should look like. That didn't stop them from insisting I should buy right then because the time would be cut from 8 weeks of shipping to just 3. I informed them I had to consult with my insurance to see how payment would work. They just wouldn't take no for an answer! The manager then came into the booth/room saying "I heard you had doubts about your insurance" and she offered to give me some forms to submit for reimbursement. First of all, super creepy and a huge lack of privacy. They can hear everything you talk about. Any non-HIPAA person (though I doubt the people there are HIPAA compliant anyway) can hear what you're talking about. Overall, I felt that they were way too pushy. This is not only a big financial investment, it is a huge task to take on. I'm forcing my bones to shift. I thought I'd save some dough and hear them out but nope. No way I'm letting them anywhere near my teeth. When I asked if it hurts they said yes, but that I can cut them with nail clippers if I need to make them fit better. Nail clippers!!! Overall, just way too pushy to make a sale, and probably get commission. They seemed to have an answer for everything.
I don't write reviews often but they also really forcefully encouraged me to write a review on google maps. So here I am, here's my honest review.</Review>< gmapID>

Raul was great. Professional, but also funny. He answered all of my questions and made sure I understood everything that would be happening. Janet, Cornelius, Ron and the rest of the staff in the office were also very friendly and helpful. :-)</text>

The experience was similar to purchasing a used car.
The people who scanned my teeth pressured me to purchase as soon as the device left my mouth. They said the scan would take 72 hours to get to a dentist and then back to me. So in 3 days I'd be able to see the "after" of what my teeth should look like. That didn't stop them from insisting I should buy right then because the time would be cut from 8 weeks of shipping to just 3. I informed them I had to consult with my insurance to see how payment would work. They just wouldn't take no for an answer! The manager then came into the booth/room saying "I heard you had doubts about your insurance" and she offered to give me some forms to submit for reimbursement. First of all, super creepy and a huge lack of privacy. They can hear everything you talk about. Any non-HIPAA person (though I doubt the people there are HIPAA compliant anyway) can hear what you're talking about. Overall, I felt that they were way too pushy. This is not only a big financial investment, it is a huge task to take on. I'm forcing my bones to shift. I thought I'd save some dough and hear them out but nope. No way I'm letting them anywhere near my teeth. When I asked if it hurts they said yes, but that I can cut them with nail clippers if I need to make them fit better. Nail clippers!!! Overall, just way too pushy to make a sale, and probably get commission. They seemed to have an answer for everything.
I don't write reviews often but they also really forcefully encouraged me to write a review on google maps. So here I am, here's my honest review.</Review>

Never thought getting my smile checked would be such a pleasant experience. From the minute I walked in the door Sara was amazingly kind and helpful. She took very good care of me during my consultation and helped me understand what I could do to get the perfect smile I always wished I had. She even gave me options to make sure everything was doable within my budget. Thank you Sara for hooking me up with my early Christmas gift to myself!!!<//text>

I walked in at 6pm and was greeted with a smile and a super easy check-in process. I was offered water, which was perfect since I’m sure I had leftover lunch breath from hours earlier and didn’t want to offend whoever did my 3-D scan haha. Sara did the scan for me, was super friendly and upbeat (rare for 6pm on a Friday!) and handled all my questions with ease. The scan itself was a breeze! It was awesome to get to see the 3-D interactive imaging once it was complete... and it felt like the scan only took a few minutes. No awkward devices forcing my mouth open, no molding clay or anything equally unpleasant, just a totally quick and painless session that I probably could have even done on my lunch break.

The offices are clean and very well organized, very relaxing, and I’m all in now. Pleasantly surprised with Smile Direct Club so far and I have a really good feeling about the results 😁< /review>

The office is sparkling and so welcoming and the process is professional and fun. They scan your teeth — no messy impressions! Yaritza and Cornelius were SO helpful and SO patient with all of my questions. There was an issue with my new credit card (completely AmEx's fault) and Yaritza was so kind and patient and helpful. Cornelius was also so helpful explaining the whitening light, etc. I can't recommend this shop and this staff highly enough. You feel like you are in good hands with real people who care about you and your results!!<//Review>

Yaritza was super nice, she take the time to explain me what comes in the smiles box once the treatment is ready, and answered all my questions. The procedure of 3D scan was super easy, much better than the x-rays we need to take in dentist office. I am looking forward to start my treatment.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

If I could give negative stars to this place, I would. I feel robbed and extremely annoyed that I even wasted my time going in for a "free" appointment last Sunday for liners. I was told that I would receive an email in my inbox asking me to approve the charge of over $1800 dollars as well as the physical liners themselves. Once the email was received, I was to physically click "approve" in the email to start the process. Cut to - I never received this email in my inbox and was fine with it as I was not going to pursue these liners. Well, today, I received an email saying I had been charged over $1800 and that my liners were on the way. In no way, shape, or form did I EVER approve this. When I called, I was able to receive a refund and cancellation of shipping but this was after someone explained I had "signed off" on this process. I never gave them the okay yet they went ahead and did it. This place is sketchy and I would never recommend anyone using them. Thanks.

Update - still have NOT been refunded and just received another email from the company saying my smile is ready. Would literally never walk back into Smile Direct Club - I do not have time to go back and forth after I have already requested a cancellation and was told it was cancelled.<//Text>

<Review>I was a bit nervous going in. I had visited the SmileDirectClub in Beverly Hills but LET. ME. TELL. YOU. Juan and Cornelius are grade A AMAZING I wish my appointment was much longer and I am not kidding lol from the time I walked in Cornelius made me feel super comfortable and welcomed with a smile. I remember having to reschedule my appointment twice in one day lol and he was super nice and patient with me and he is 100% the same in person. Juan had did my 3D scan and there was no questions for me to ask because he had answered them ALL but still made sure if I had any of my own personal questions through the whole process, he takes his time and is very gentle but quick. Both men gave me the best experience better than any office I have ever visited. Not only are they very professional with their work they will also have you smiling and laughing your entire visit and you will for sure be leaving with a bigger smile than you arrived with because of their kind services big big thanks to Juan and Cornelius once again if I could give more stars I would. I can’t wait to recommend others to this location.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bda158ffeacf:0xe8604d5f02267247</gmap_id><date>1573166854099<//date>< Pics>

I had such a great experience with Raul and Cornelius today! From the moment I walked in the door everyone was kind, attentive, and super efficient. Raul was very knowledgable and easy going which made the visit painless. As a Invisalign patient years ago, I was amazed by the new technology Smile Direct Club has. Excited to get started, and to go to some of the fun events Cornelius mentioned!</Review>

Raul was was very informative and friendly! I was very pleased with my initial impressions of the sdc and furthermore when my aligners arrived ahead of time! I recommend this to anyone who wants to cut cost by not going to a orthodontist office to get paddy imprints for high cost liners like Invisalign! I cut my expenditure by over 50%, and these liners are legit!<//Review>

<Review>Yaritza, dental assistant, and the entire staff were so personable. I got to connect with Yaritza and she was very knowledgeable and friendly. Best orthodontist experience! I’m obsessed with the tooth whitening kit, even though I’ve never whitened my teeth before. I know I’ll be buying those replacements for life. I’m excited to show off my newfound confidence with my new smile. I’ll definitely refer friends and family.< /Review></record>

I did my impressions myself a while back but I  had to come in to get 3D scans with their new technology and boy was I pleased! The facilities and staff are just on point, the office is nice and spacious, and their tech. is awesome. Yanet and Yaritza welcomed me and helped me through my scans with the best customer service and thorough explanation of everything. I super recommend SmileDirectClub and this specific office.</Text>

Just went in for an 3D scan as part of an approved free re-evaluation since I was unhappy with the straightening of my lower teeth after finishing my course of initial aligners.
I originally made my molds at home with a kit I bought at CVS because didn't want to drive to Hollywood for a scan (the nearest SmileShop at the time).
Raul was friendly, utterly professional and really took the time to make sure my second round of aligners were going to get me the results I want.
After the scan which took less than 5 minutes, Raul sat with me and we went tooth by tooth in the area of my concern to determine exactly what needed to happen to each tooth to achieve my ideal straightened smile. Then he made sure I had answers to all my questions about timing, retainer use, etc.
After my experience with Raul at the Beverly Hills SmileShop I wish I had done the 3D scan from the beginning. Logistically it takes a fourth of the time than doing your own molds at home packing and shipping them - total time in and out 20 minutes - can't beat that! Moreover, it felt like the dental professional assigned to my case is going to have better impressions of my teeth and more complete information, with the help of Raul, to ensure my next round of aligners are going to get me to my ideal smile.</review>

<review>I truly did have a 5-star experience! Firstly, the atmosphere of the whole place was so welcoming and not to mention very aesthetically pleasing. It felt like I was walking into a commercial! I first met Sara, who helped me set up an account and prep my private room for the consultation. She was so friendly that I almost forgot I was there to get dental services. I really felt like they wanted to get to know me beyond just inspecting my teeth and getting my payment details. I then met Summer, who guided me through my consultation. She was incredible! Just like her name, she had such a sunny and comforting presence that made the experience that much more amazing. Not only did she go through every detail of the process with me, but, like Sara, she also took the time to actually get to know who I was beyond just a set of teeth. She really took the time to go through everything in detail to make sure I knew everything I wanted to know about the process so I was not in the dark about anything. Summer even took the time to help me sort out a payment strategy that best fit my situation. She really made me feel even more excited about getting started with Smile Direct Club than I already was before going into the store. Finally, I met Cornelius, who came in to do a final check on my 3D scan and pictures to send into the lab. He was so professional and, like Sara and Summer, was so kind. Cornelius really made sure I got all my answers covered and that I was having a great experience, which I was! Also, with Coachella around the corner, he invited me to the shop’s GrinFest Day where they give out goodie-filled fanny packs and free makeovers with professional hair-braiding and teeth whitening. Summer then gave me a goodie bag with a complimentary teeth whitening kit and lip balm before escorting me out the store. All in all, the unbelievably generous services by the Beverly Hills location made me so happy that I chose to start my Smile Direct Club journey with them.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1555353964228, 'text': "Hi Isabella, thank you so much for the positive feedback and for taking the time to post this review.

< Review>
So far got the 3D scan done today. Wish I had someone more knowledgable with this process as the person helping me is just a tech that works with the 3D scanner. I think I had a trainee which is okay, but it felt like someone shoving a massive toothbrush pretending to brush my teeth very nervously with no bedside manner. I just hope the scan came out good for the approved offsite dentist/orthodontists to be able to properly see all my teeth to determine how long the process of straightening my teeth would be.

They had a salesperson approach with the typical building rapport and learning the word tracks of what to say when asked a question. I didn't have a lot of questions but the response of not asking too many questions as "most people have" was a bit alarming so I wanted to do more research after my visit. Look at all the youtube videos and reviews before you do this.

This apparently will not solve your under bite or over bite. As a matter of fact, if you have crowded lower teeth and spaced out upper teeth, and currently your teeth are aligned... You will develop an underbite as they close out your upper gaps and space out your lower teeth...

This makes me afraid. I wish they had mentioned this before I handed over my payment information.

I still got a deal on what the procedure will be. I've always have been self conscious of my smile. The debate really is if this will cause the wear on my teeth for having the smile I want. Once your teeth are straightened, your bite will be different. Everyone that has reviewed have mentioned, their bite isn't 100%.

Proceeding with caution for now...

Be sure to ask a ton of questions. 😬</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) One of the best experiences I have ever had!
First of all I thank Yanet and Kathy for their incredible kindness and charisma for helping me clear all the doubts I had about Smile Direct Club. They helped me explain step by step what I needed for the process of aligning my teeth. I do not regret visiting SmileDirectClub it simply provides good service to people who want to fix their teeth, I highly recommend it.
