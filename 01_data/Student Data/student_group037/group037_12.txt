I being here several times during the years and I like the place ambiance... five ⭐️ for great drinks and music… for food and service is the 3 ⭐️ I haven’t had the best service all the time but mostly is ok.. the reason I give them 3 stars is the Last time I went was a week ago and I was a bit disappointed on vegetarian and vegan options.. most places seem to cater more and when ask to get the vegetarian empanadas they said they are sold in a trio .. I think they could of cater that. Just my opinion.. will be back for drinks but not so much for food.</Text>

I love this place!!  The space is really beautiful and the people involved with it are so amazingly nice and down to earth.

The location is different than where I'm used to going, but I think it's fair to say that we can all use some change from time to time.

They're really doing some interesting things with their line-up and themes- Battle of the Decades Wednesday party and so on.

Plus, if it's the best consistent Sunday morning house music party in town.  Thank god.

Come support this place- it's fantastic!</text>

It was an OK restaurant. The food was fine and the waiters were nice. My problem was the tables and chairs. They were plastic and not very sturdy for a restaurant. Also the plates were plastic and not the cleanest.<//text>

<review>This place is great. The food is good, the atmosphere is great, and the staff works hard to accomodate the throng of people that crowd in here on weekends. Sometimes they fall short though. Like the time my friends and I were in there and got skipped over on the sign in board because there was just too much craziness going on. It was pretty annoying. They need to come up with a bettter system than the sign in board.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dd3139977bf6c5:0xd29eb4f1a2268c3d</Gmap_id>< response>

But beware of the iPhone theft ring. Last time I went, at least 4-5 girls in our group (all admittedly a little tipsy) had their phones stolen from their handbags that they were holding. A fun night out, but be warned to watch your stuff.< /review>

Let me just begin with how friendly and nice the bouncers and promoters were with my group of friends, it was my birthday weekend so I came in free so they treated me so nicely and had a deal for us. The bar was clean, the ambience was amazing, the DJ was very fun with so many mixes of different kinds of music. Overall me and my friends loved it and can’t wait to come back</Text>

< review>
Went here for a gno.. My friend and I stood at the bar for about 20 minutes before the bartender ever attended us. She took every man that walked up to the bar before us without even acknowledging us. I noticed when she finally did attend us she measured out our drinks where as every man she attended she just turned the bottle upside down without measuring.. I called her out and told her we didn’t appreciate the way she was treating us and very sarcastically she responded “sorry you feel that way”. I mentioned this to the bouncer up front and they were empathetic but unfortunately didn’t know who was bartending so didn’t know her name.. It’s 2020 and we have no room for this type of sexist behavior! Especially from another woman.<//review>

<Review>This place is ridiculous! Came here for college night with a few of my under age friends, and were followed the whole night by that bald bouncer... every spot we went to HE WAS THERE. I guess he was expecting me to let one of my friends get a sip of my drink so he can toss us out. NO we weren’t about to pull that stunt, we just came to have a good time! Needless to say, we left early because it was dead and because we felt watched the entire time. He even went as far as standing next to the GIRLS restroom to take my drink from my friends hand whom I asked to hold while I peed, and placed it OUTSIDE for any potential lovely creeps to roofie while I took a leak lol. Absolutely ridiculous and inappropriate! Must’ve been very desperate to earn an extra $0.50 on top of his low wage as a bouncer. Dude grow some hair and get over yourself< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

The music is not great, they repeated the same snipets of songs like three times. Also, if you’re a girl wearing heels, you can’t take breaks by sitting down because apparently ALL the sitting areas are prohibited. Not to mention that security and promoters are really rude, I completely understand the frustration from dealing with people who are intoxicated but that doesn’t excuse yelling at people in such a negative way. I myself would not recommend this location to anyone and will not be returning. Across the street though there’s a club Alegria that has much better music and doesn’t police you like they do.<//Review>

<review>They need better DJs because hearing the same trap songs all night ain't gonna work. If they gonna play the same genre then atleast have variety. The security guards are rude and over police people too much. Everything is expensive, they try to act like a fancy club but they really aren't. You can easily go to any club in long beach and it will be 10 times better. It is overpriced and annoying. You cannot even have fun because of the way the space is as well. Don't waste your money if you trying to heat the same trap songs all night. There's only one dance floor so if go in there be prepared to hear the same things all night.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>Went to this place to celebrate a birthday we had dinner at the restaurant followed by the night club upstairs. I gotta say this place is overpriced. The prices on food and drinks are ridiculous. The food is not all good either and the portions you get are not worth the price. My boyfriend and I paid $76 for two shrimp/beef burnt skewers and two sides of mashed potatoes.The only good thing I gotta say about this place is the service at the restaurant only was good but the food not great. As for the club the vip section we got was super dirty the floor was wet before we even went in.I kept slipping while dancing.  The prices they charge on the drinks and the bottle service RIDICULOUS!!!  I do not recommend this place at all and will not be going back first and last time I go here!<//Review>< pictures>

He posted repeats of the same chick, not that cute, and some other randoms. Looks like House party pictures of his friends.

< Review>
Went to pajamas Thursday. The posters outside the club promised the music would be 'edm house, top 40 and hip hop'. After being in there 3,5 hours we only heard 3 songs that where not hip hop.

There's no places to sit unless you pay the $200 bottle service for a table.

Before paying the $15 cover fee we asked about the music and was told from the promoters it would be a mix of all genres. Once inside both the bartenders and security said that it's mostly hip hop.

The people working there is friendly and helpful though.

In summation: good place to stand and listen to hip hop.< /Review>

I been to both sevillas. In riverside and Long beach. The Long beach one charges way more. The security is extremely rude. After spending a little over $800 dollars for 3 ciroc bottles my fiance couldn't use the restroom for the reason that they were about to close. Three security guards literally came to our VIP SECTION and order us to leave. This was less than 5 min of closing. We were just waiting for my fiance to come back from the restroom and we were just downing our last drink! For 1 bottle its $300 and for a 12 pack of modelos its $140! And with all that comes disrespect amd unappreciation!< /Text>

< Review>
This club was heavily policed; with security guards ~4 feet apart from each other and all over the stage. The staff was also unprofessional and unnecessarily rude, where one girl was literally SHOVED in front of everyone. Disgusting. They also replay every song and mentions the Latinos “in the house” at least 100 times for no reason being.< /Review>

Authentic Spanish Guitar music on Friday and Saturday nights from 10pm to 2am is what brought me here for the last 10+ years, amazing musicians are invited to perform, it was always worth driving 100 miles round trip from Orange County . Awesome tapas selection, you will not have shortage of choices,  even if you were born in Andalusia :-)</text>

This place has proven to be a cesspool of disgust.  Girls watch out!!!  Security guards and disrespectful men groping women. Really sad and degrading to female patrons.  I had to give it a star to post this but it deserves no stars.< /Text>

Horrible
Takes about 20 min to get a table and  40 min to get any type of drink or food !!!
Same music all night don't mix it up
And my table was as messy as it could get all night if it wasn't because I would be putting dishes and cups together don't get me wrong guy was super nice but oh my god they are super under staffed I can't even imagine how the kitchen looks like 😫</Text>< Rate>

My friends and I dined at the restaurant and we were told that if we dined we would not need to pay the cover charge to the night club. When we proceeded to the night club and showed our receipt for dinner they still asked for cover charge of $20 when we started walking away they said they would charge instead $10. That really put me off. We ended up dancing to salsa music in the restaurant instead of the night club.<//Text>

<Review>Terrible rap music and dj flex couldn't even transition. Took my girlfriend there to dance but how could you when every other word was the N word.  It was a trainwreck between every horrible track.  Got there at 11pm on a Saturday night and it was like a high school dance.

I know the restaurant section downstairs was closed a while back do to roaches the night club itself is no better just with the people being the roaches instead. It's just your typical douchebag club with horrible music and attitudes flying around like everyone is someone. Not a fun experience at all. Takes hours to get a drink and you have to wade through a crowd of people who smell like they bathed in some 99 cent store cologne</text>

IMO, if they would lower the prices by a buck or two they'd move a lot more merchandise. They don't seem to want to or aren't allowed to work with me either. As it is I'm more often than not walking out the store not having bought a thing. They don't seem to get it.</Text>

It was a pleasure shopping here because of her professionalism and patience. Considering this was my first time at this good will I decided to make this my home goodwill store; in hopes to receive her good energy and willingness to offer her help and opinion.Overall absolute pleasure, Thank you Isabel happy New Years girly!

<text>Loaded up the SUV with carefully  packed items that could be sold.  Brusque attendant pulled boxes out and DUMPED them into a bin. Breakables, silver, everything jumbled together. Don’t bother taking your stuff here. They do not appreciate the donation or take care of the things which could be resold.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Today I found  two, NWT chaise lounge cushions  for 7.99 each. Retails well over $50 each, so I was happy to find these today.  I was in the area for work, I always make it a point to go to any GW I'm close to, as you never know what you'll find. Glad I stopped here today.</Review>

< review>
I tried to checkout and Mary the manager changed the price from 8.99 to 12.99. AT THE CHECKOUT! WHO DOES THAT!? When I asked to use the bathroom for my emergency condition I was denied access to the bathroom which is against the law.<//review>

<user_name>Barba Mundial</user_name><Text>First time visiting this place this past weekend - nice outdoor seating area with tables socially distanced from each other. Orders are taken by staff and brought to you, and the outdoor space has large screens playing music videos. Drinks were decent but it's cash only - so bring your own (but they told me there's also an atm).

Also, park on the street - it's an alley entrance but there's no parking back there and a ton of people chill back there - better to not even do down there.< /Text></record>

A terrific gay bar in the middle of nowhere but Freeway close. I enjoy the fact that it features both indoor and outdoor patio areas. The drinks are honest and a phenomenal value and if you're lucky you'll be served by the vision of a trans or CD lady. I enjoy going there for the Sunday afternoon beer busts. The option to sing karaoke is also included. Really refreshing to be able to enjoy a gay bar where yes there's a good crowd but there's also enough room to spread out and walk around and change the scenery so to speak from time to time. Sign up with their website for special events.<//Text>

On top of that he is super sweet, professional, and patient. My bf and I love coming to support the many events that go on, but we are always happy to just go and chat with Craig. Gonzo and the other bartenders are nice as well and fast. They know how to kick it in gear so you don't have to wait long for a drink.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Great new bar in North Long Beach. It took over the old Piston bar and I'm liking the changes. The bartenders provide great service and make the place enjoyable. Has a great time Monday night for their Karaoke night<//Text>

Its in a bad location. Its waaaaay too small. It was a great thought but i feel this would have done better somewhere closer to downtown Long Beach. Maybe somewhere near the seedy industrial areas near the river between PCH and Anaheim. That would have been perfect with a lot of truckstops and the port near by.< /Text>

I love this new bar! Was there a couple times for Sunday beer bust/underwear party and had a blast! Very friendly bartenders, reasonable prices, the djs are great especially Hazmat and Yello who play everything from 80s to today's hits. They have Outside smoking patio, pool table. So much fun and great music.</Text>

Dallas was a super amazing. She helped me with all my needs and was very personable. She made my doing experience the best! I wish there were more options in my DDD size in the store tho. I'm not a big fan of waiting for things to ship😝 Thanks again Dallas!</Text>

Better fitting clothing for larger sizes. Helpful staff but they kinda hustled us along to close up shop. I don't blame them, but I just spent a lot of money so, give me 3 minutes.</Text>

I enjoy shopping Lane Bryant and this location usually has a wide variety and and great selection. We spent quite a bit of time shopping the huge clearance section today and Maddie was very helpful.< /Review>< Pics>

I had multiple interviews coming up and had gone through just about every shop AND Torrid's limited selection of "slacks," just to be disappointed everywhere I went. Lane Bryant, on the other hand, somehow had the PERFECT fitting slacks in my size. So happy with my purchase and will definitely be going back for more slacks!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Lane Bryant Arden Fair Mall did not have a wide variety of options. If you are looking for dresses or jumpsuits a lot of options. There jeans are very limited and shirt selection is mostly floral. I was not impressed I thought a mall of this capacity would have as lot more options. The employees sre not that friendly either.<//Review>

<Text>Just finished shopping at Lane Bryant Arden Fair Mall. I met Julia. Today was her first day at this location. She is from the Folsom store. I told her that I needed a professional outfit for my job. Julia was amazing. She helped me put items together. I ended up with2 really nice pair of slacks and a beautiful blazer. It makes me feel confident.
Thank you Julia it was a pleasure.</Text><Time>1541220321608<//Time><rate>5<//rate>< Name>

Excellent job and the recipients were very surprised and happy with the hand delivery and quality of flowers.  The bouquet that was received perfectly matched the image, which rarely happens with online floral services.  Highly recommend!< /review>

My amazing family had some flowers delivered after a surgery last week and Enchanted Florist DELIVERED. Not only do these gorgeous flowers STILL look amazing 5 days later, but I can replant the succulent. What a beautiful treat!</text>

<Review>Ordered a large bouquet for a good friend who lives in Burbank - she was wowed by her floral gift. It was huge, beautiful, fresh!

<Review>My partner absolutely adored his arrangement! All the flowers were good quality and the piece was delivered in a timely and careful fashion. I was so thrilled to find a shop flagged as LGBTQ-friendly, and to get to send him birthday flowers in bi pride colors--in a unicorn, no less!! Such a delight. Thank you!!</Review>< pictures>

Beyond wonderful! I ordered the succulent and bamboo box. It was much more amazing in person with a flower and even a bunny decoration on it for Easter. We were so happy with what we received. They went beyond and we even received it at noon which was great. Thank you!</Text>

During the years I lived in Burbank, the Enchanted Florist was always my go to for original arrangements created with unique style, originality and excellent quality. After being gone from the area for eight years,  I recently ordered an arrangement for a friend's surgery and am pleased to report all of those qualities are still top priorities at the Enchanted Florist.<//Text>

<Review>The flowers arrived on time but the flowers I ordered were supposed to be lavender. The vase was didn't match the color flowers. For the price I was hoping it would have been perfect, especially when the description said lavender bouquet.< /Review>< name>

Flowers were beautiful. But I lucked out even being able to pick them up. On the day before Mother's Day, this florist closes at Noon. Noon. Wow. Something that wasn't even explicitly stated in my confirmation email. Now, clearly I shouldn't have assumed later hours without checking, but I can't imagine closing at noon the last day they are open before the biggest Flower holiday of the year. Thankfully, there was somebody still there making flower arrangements, and they gave me my prepaid order. So all is well that ended well and lesson learned, never assume someone's common sense business model, always check store hours when you order.< /Review>

My friend told me she loved her arrangement. I did not see it, and trust that the upgraded version was worth the extra price. My only question is that I did not know the optional extra flowers that went into the design. She was delighted, and that's what counts for me!</Review>

This is the second time I’ve sent an arrangement from Enchanted Florist (Burbank) and both were absolutely beautiful. This time I sent Ocean Sparkle and the color of the vase and the flowers represented that theme well. I am out of state and have been very pleased with the personal touch and variety of arrangements.<//Text>

<review>THE most beautiful flowers always.  I've used them for two funerals now and they always do a fantastic job.  They don't create arrangements, they create artworks.  Will be using them again and again.< /review>< pics>

The flowers were beautiful. The only thing is I ordered a large bouquet and she got 2 small ones (as shown in the picture)? Not sure why it was sent in 2 instead of just making it larger?<//Review>

I have ordered from this florist multiple times and have never been disappointed. Their delivery is prompt, their arrangements are sent as pictured, and often even better. Recently, I mentioned Tiger Lilies in my card for an order, and even though the arrangement I ordered only included regular lilies, the florist switched them for Tiger Lilies at no additional charge. A special touch that most florists wouldn't even notice made all the difference!<//Review>

<text>I LOVE this place. It smells heavenly and has absolutely the most exquisite flowers ever. They can do all the standard stuff, but if you want something really memorable you will not be disappointed. Just ask, and explain who the flowers are for. They will find the perfect one of a kind container, and customize the arrangement. The shop has beautiful cards and unique items for gifts, priced from medium to high. They have always been super nice and friendly, making the extra effort to deliver at the specific time I asked for. It gets VERY crazy around Mother's Day and Valentines, so probably NOT the best holidays to try them for the first time.<//text>< UserId.>

I'm always looking for flowers at the very last moment and I'm always in a time crunch.  I'm horrible at putting flowers together myself.  The Enchanted Florist is so incredibly friendly,  I just point to the flowers I like,  give them the colors and what want I to spend, and they magically conjure up an exquisite bouquet.  Doesn't matter whether it's for a prom or for a loved one,  they have the most beautiful arrangements and they thank me when I should be thanking them! I absolutely love them! Five stars aren't enough.<//Review>

I first used The Enchanted Florist when I worked at one of the nearby studios and it was a new local business -- I always tried to use local.  It bucked the trend, but Kim always delivered on time and her flowers lasted and were beautiful.  I'm no longer in the business, but whenever I need to send flowers I call The Enchanted Florist -- the corsage for my son's first prom date, sympathy for a family related death, or just because it's my anniversary and I believe that men deserve flowers too.  I've never been disappointed.<//text>

<Time>1555793397331<//Time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>MrB/Enchanted Florist has been my florist for over 15 years.  Today I called about an arrangement received that was not up to par for the first time ever.     While past management has been customer oriented, the current manager expressed no concern about the product or my satisfaction.  She attributed all problems to me. Totally unwilling to stand behind their product.  I do not understand the lack of concern and the possibility that I might have cause.  Lost me as customer.< /text>< pics>

I just placed my third custom order with Enchanted Florist and, as with the previous two, the reaction I received to them was priceless.  I've spoken with Kim and she takes the time to hear the ideas I have and creates something far more than I could imagine.  Excellent service, great prices and the most unique arrangements I've ever seen.< /review>

Refused to finish my order when I expressed concern about the durability of a wrist corsage for my nephew for his prom. I am now left scrambling to find another solution. Thanks for nothing!< /text>

I am so disappointed with the flowers you delivered to me guys..My husband is out of state and he ordered the flowers last valentines day from you because he said he liked  the name of the shop. When he called he asked me if I liked the roses (he ordered 1 dozen he said)..I said I did because I did not want to hurt his feelings...and it's always the thought that counts BUT I did not like it because first and foremost it was'nt a DOZEN..it was only SIX (3 red, 3 white) with 2 hydrangeas and some ferns and the arrangement was bad. I checked your website and it says there that the arrangement was 105.00!!!! The picture is not the same as the real delivery. Please guys, if the order is a DOZEN roses, PLEASE deliver a DOZEN!!!! not SIX with some ferns. Enchanted I was not.< /text>

Kim the manager said I was the rudest person she has ever met in her life!!! ,Wow I was just trying to get her to credit me because they double charged me. Kim customer service dictates "the customer is always right" Customer Service 101!! Worst experience with a florist ever.... You are never too big or important to argue with a customer shame on you and shame on enchanted florist...</review>

Portion size is great for the large size, and salsa is delicious as well. Would gladly take my out of town friends here when they decide to visit. Staff is friendly as well<//Review>< Pics>

Bruh!!! I got the 7 piece chicken tenders with fries and it came to about two meals lunch and dinner!!! (Big portions) The Tennessee hot medium is a great sauce choice I highly recommend this place. My brother got the wok and said it was fire too! 🔥🔥</review>

<review>Alright to be honest the plating isn't that great, and I only got 3small pieces of steak. That's where the bad stops. Period. The food was amazing. The staff were polite, friendly, and sociable. The was about a 16 min. But this was well worth it.< /review><time>1611281892821< /time>< Pics>

<Text>This is my first experience. 5 stars because Calvin took my order 10min before closing which is rare because most companies wont do that. The food was delicious and the customer service from Calvin was excellent.ill be back because the food was good and customer service does make all the difference!< /Text>< Date>

<Text>A fusion restaurant done right! The @wokntender offers chicken tenders of all flavor combinations and the best stir fry in DTLA. You gotta try their Nashville hot chicken which is seasoned to perfection and the Asian sweet chili is also a must try. As for stir fry, the steak with fries is not only juicy but the green sauce you add on top makes this mouth-watering.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS6mvJ-k_NcG5MPgHvB0IaZt4RTYS6gOWZxGnx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJZwKFF7D--giFdEHkdaTZoFP6_3Xd5dsM3Zq1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Review>This place is legit good fried food and food in general. The tenders and waffle fries are ON POINT!!! I still have not tried the fried rice combos but they look amazing. The tenders have been so good that I never deviate. I think its the same owners as Birdies (next door). It makes sense as both are very good.</Review>< resp>

Birdies is great next-door, and this place is also owned by Birdies. Great chicken, huge portions. The large is worth it, $12 for what can easily be two meals. Great sauces, the stir fry with fries is great.</text>

We recently found this place and we love it!!! I would like to mention that the choice of music  is not at all of good taste. I would not like my 8 year old listening to profanity and racially explicit music. Please re consider your ambient.<//Text>

high priced chicken and potato waffles if you ask me. .. but for my first I enjoyed the tenders thoroughly. .. now I don't feel so bad for paying so much.  However I wasn't able to just order one item. .. I was only given the option to purchase a complete combo.  meh, I'l be back I'm sure.  The (one) guy at the counter was very helpful as the other guy in the back yelled at me because I didn't know I needed to wear a mask (mid order).  meh. .. I'm sure I'll be back the tenders were really tastey. =)</Text>

We had a wing combo and chicken sandwich. Food came out super hot and fresh. Chicken sandwich puts Popeyes & Chick-fil-A to shame. The bun is life changing. If I could change one thing I would ask for a homemade ranch dressing but the bottled one  they use isn't that bad.<//text>

They were professionals in the truest sense of the word, walked me through the whole experience and made sure I was completely comfortable the entire time. They listened to all my wants, and concerns and honestly gave me the pout of my dreams !

< Review>
JENNA IS THE MOST AMAZING NURSE EVER!!!! Before her I was strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. Prior to Jenna I wasn’t seeing results and I didn’t have a good experience with the nurse and to make everything worse she burned my legs and I had 100 plus cuts all over my legs. That was months ago and the marks are still on my legs. As soon as Jenna started doing my laser hair removal I noticed immediate results! Almost immediately I knew that Jenna knew what she was doing. She is so sweet and humble and is the most amazing nurse there!!! She listens to you and does what she needs to do for results. I could seriously go on an on about how amazing she is but I’m pretty sure everyone that sees her and works with her already knows. She is so amazing and I appreciate her so much! She needs a raise for being so amazing!!! Now that she does my hair removal I won’t be looking for a new spa. Thank you Jenna for your outstanding work !!!!</Review>

Laser Clinique is beautiful in the inside and all the staff members were so welcoming and professional. I had the aesthetic nurse Jenna and she was extremely experienced, knowledgeable, and attentive to my skin goals. I highly recommend her, especially if you're a little nervous at first, she calmed any nerves that I had. I can't wait to go back!<//text>< Response>

I called to make an appointment and asked what kind of accommodations they make (as required by LAW) for people with medical exemptions that cannot wear masks. I was happy to wait outside until my room was ready where I take off the mask anyways but I was told that they do not honor medical exemptions. This is discrimination. They cannot make policies that violate state and federal laws. Yes, they are privately owned but they are open to the public as a public accommodation and laws are enforced to protect human god given rights. Guidelines are not above the law. They are recommendations. And it’s sad that they are in the medical field and not aware of all the dangers associated with prolonged mask use. Masks do NOT stop or slow the spread of viruses. Masks are worn in the medical field to keep bacteria out of open wounds and that is ALL. And scientific data even proves that is up for debate. It’s a false sense of security that are making people more sick. I am disappointed to hear they discriminate as I was pleased with the Dr my last visit.< /Text>

I am so happy with my results of botox and filler in my lips. Dr  Ataii is amazing with his needles. I look natural, refreshed and feel wonderful. Can't recommend Laser Clinique enough. I'm 67 years old and never looked or felt better.
Thanks to everyone at Laser Clinique.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>Started going to Laser Clinique for laser hair removal and facial treatments about 4 years ago, and have now added microneedling with PRP, Juvederm Volbella injections, and microblading into my repertoire. Each and every time I am met with superb quality of care and service!  The doctor, nurses, and practitioners explain the process, ask important questions to ensure that the requested treatment is right for me, and make it an enjoyable experience overall.  I also love how clean, hygienic, and modern the facility is.  They have taken all the necessary precautions during these COVID times to ensure that I have not been exposed to the virus that can carry into the facility and that all the staff within the facility are protecting themselves and all clients walking through the doors.  Made me feel super safe throughout it all.  Thank you, Laser Clinique, for all that you do and what you stand for - excellence!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1614134576303, 'text': 'We appreciate your kind words, Penelope!'}</Response><GmapID>0x80dc07ae1d10c75b:0x95906cd92759b4a4</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have to say Dr. Ataii at Laser Clinique is UNMATCHED. With an artistic and gentle approach, Dr. Ataii treats EACH patient like an individual, not just another name on the schedule. After discussing some of my concerns with Dr. Ataii, we were able to find a good plan to matches my needs. I feel so beautiful, like myself again! I would definitely recommend Laser Clinique for any of your aesthetic needs.< /review>

Laser Cliniqúe has a welcoming staff, even during a stressful pandemic, and everyone took part in ensuring my comfort and satisfaction were guaranteed. While my service was not intensive, I suggest giving this place a chance in resolving any beauty areas of opportunity and improvement!</Text>

I absolutely LOVE this place!!! I've been coming here since Sep 2018 and my experiences only continue to get better. I used to have this misconception that laser hair removal was not within the means of my budget, but I was completely wrong. Not only do they make it affordable, but despite their VERY reasonable prices they make you feel "rich" every time you go there. The spa itself is immaculate and the staff/nurses are all so nice.

Speaking of the nurses, if you're lucky enough to get Joselyn to perform your treatments consider yourself blessed!! She is exponentially WONDERFUL!!! She's in very high demand and doesn't work there everyday. But, honestly, all of the nurses I've dealt with have been wonderful.... So whoever performs your treatments will give you a great experience.

I highly recommend this place!! 5 stars for sure!!<//Review>

<text>The staff was courteous and skilled, the facility clean and comfortable. Dr. Atai was friendly, experienced, and very knowledgeable. Also, their prices are competitive. While I'm not a serial reviewer, Dr. Atai and his staff are deserving of my time and honesty. Personally, I've only had botox, but would like him to do a peel. However, a very close friend had laser facial treatments there prior to her wedding and was very pleased. The results were pretty impressive.
Yes, I would, without hesitation, recommend Laser Clinique to my family and friends looking for any cosmetic improvements.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Everyone is very polite, I was a little bit hesitant for my first appointment I never done anything cosmetic before. They all eased my nerves and even called me after my appointment to make sure everything turned out ok. The doctor was amazing, he joked around and had one on one conversations with me that made me feel comfortable, I have meet doctors before that are too serious and do not take the time to explain fully that was never the case with this clinic. I will definitely be going back.</review>

My daughter and I both get treated at the Laser cliniqúe.  I had a laser tattoo removal treatment and had the best experience.  The setting made you calm and relaxed.  The way staff talks you through each steps really helps. The pain did not even seem as bad as other treatments I've had in the past at other facilities. The hair removal process is equally as pleasant. My daughter and I highly recommend the Laser Cliniqúe for all your beauty needs.  It is very clean, comfortable and the staff is awesome! Very knowledgeable, patient and professional.< /Text>

Dr. Attaii is a true artist and uses superb aesthetic judgment to determine exactly what to do and when!  I have been getting various treatments from him for a decade now and I am more than delighted with the results.  I have done botox, juvederm, ultherapy, FX laser, and some laser hair removal, and people think I am 15 years younger than my passport says I am. The office is superb and well organized and the staff is always helpful.< /Text>

<text>My friend referred me to Laser Clinique and I was impressed from the moment I walked in. The front office staff were very professional and helpful. Dr. Ataii has the best personality/bedside manner I have experienced in a very long time, especially in southern CA. He explained the procedure very well and had suggestions for other services I might be interested in based on my personal area(s) of concern. I will definitely be back!<//text>< pics>

I went here based on the yelp reviews for my first ever appointment, with the thought in my mind that I would just try them out this first time and then perhaps try the several dr offices that also had great reviews that were closer to me. However, Dr. Ataii was super friendly and made me feel very comfortable. He was also very knowledgeable and willing to talk over all details and plans for the future. The staff was very welcoming and efficient. The waiting room was very comfortable even though I wasn't made to wait very long, which was very nice! So, even though the other places may be closer and also maybe just as nice, I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be returning!</Text>

Another great experience here. Not only were they on time (at 3pm on a holiday week during a Botox special!) but once again, my experience with the doctor and everyone here was amazing.  I am referring anyone I know and plan to be back as soon as I can!  BONUS - I LOVE my look!

UPDATE:  Went in for some fillers and, once again, Dr. Ataii made a few recommendations, and totally updated my look!  My daughter was the first to comment. Nothing drastic, but I look fresh.  LOVE LASER CLINIQUE!< /text>

My husband was so impressed with the results of my treatments with Dr. Ataii, it convinced him to see the doctor for his own skincare needs also. I ran out of face cream one day and saw that my husband had purchased Laser Clinique's green tea moisturizer which I ended up using and loved so much I replaced the one I'd been using for years!<//review>

I have had acne prone skin since my teenage years, and they have had good reviews and now i see why!
I met with the consultant who was super nice and super informative. After taking a look at my skin we decided on the PDT treatments. They WORKED!
needless to say, I'm impressed.
would recommend to anyone, and everyone. I give this place a 10 out of 10 for sure!<//Review>

I love this place so much, I make a two hour drive to get to it. After searching for years to find a doctor that can take care of all my beauty needs, I finally found LC 3 years ago. They take care of my laser hair removal, botox, and scar removal all in one place. The staff is always so nice, and Dr. Ataii is patient in answering all my questions every time. He is highly skilled and makes all the work look so natural... I am so happy and grateful to him for my glowing skin!</Review>

Went here for my 1st time to receive laser hair removal - so far my ongoing treatment is going great, not that painful & seems to be effective, definitely seeing way less hair growing back in. Excellent customer service & follow up by their staff members. Enjoy coming here, very pleasant experience for me.< /Review>

<review>Dr. Ataii is always very good about discussing the procedure, results expectations, what it will feel like and what it will cost.  I've had a few different kinds of treatments (most recently IPL) and each time have been pleased with the results and my experience at their clinic.< /review>< Pictures>

My experience at Laser Clinique was one of the best that I’ve ever had! I was greeted by a very warm and welcoming front office staff that assisted me with all my questions and helped prep me for my treatments. Dr. Ataii was amazing he walked me through everything that he was doing before, during and after my treatment. He made me feel very comfortable and the results I have received are above and beyond what I expected! I will choose Laser clinique for all my skin care and beauty needs every time! By the way the office is BEAUTIFUL!< /review>

As soon as I walked through the doors of Laser Clinique I was greeted with genuine smiles not the artificial kind, but honest genuine smiles. The crew they have running that ship are very down to earth. My procedures were intense, but the atmosphere and the crew helped aide with any discomfort I may have had. My results thus far have surpassed my expectations. This is a real person who was searching for a bit of confidence. This truly is a great place to find that missing piece of confidence that we know we all need. Thank you Laser Clinique.< /review>

I highly recommend Laser Clinique!  I drive 25 minutes to come here (even though there are closer clinics to my home) because Dr. Ataii is amazing, knowledgeable, kind and highly skilled.  His office happens to be gorgeous and his staff members are so professional and warm.  I'd give 10 stars if I could!!< /review>

I went to a few other people before finding Dr. Ataii and he is by far the best at doing Botox because his experience far exceeded the other specialists.  The staff is incredibly helpful and welcoming and I highly recommend laser hair removal and the facials!  The specials and the point system also keeps me coming back!!!< /text>

<Review>I came here years ago and was so happy with the results of my IPL treatment. I did go elsewhere, due to price, a year or so later. Huge mistake! Don't go anywhere else. It will not compare! I've since come back here and couldn't be happier with the customer service, quality of care, and results from my treatments. Don't think about it, just do it! :-)< /Review>< pics>

The offices are very well laid out and comfortable, the staff is always friendly and helpful, and the work of the doctor is superb.  He understands the aesthetics of faces and is careful to deliver a completely natural style of rejuvenation that is undetectable and unbeatable.</Review>

They allow your experience to be pleasant and they put up with any of my silly questions. Dr atti. Is fabulous! Great bedside manner which is incredibly hard to find! Dr atti not only performs beautiful work but is such a kind doctor and a true pioneer in his field. Check the front office the man won the best of allergen which is a huge deal! Without him and the entire staff at the laser Clinique I would be lost thankfully I'm found and I'm very happy with my results!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I've been coming to Laser Clinique for the past few years and couldn't imagine going anywhere else. The office itself is beautiful and the staff is always welcoming. Dr. Ataii  has proven to be highly skilled, knowledgeable, professional, friendly and always willing to help you out whenever you have any sort of concern or need. If you're looking for the next place to have all of your skin care needs addressed and enhanced (and get amazing results), I would highly recommend Laser Clinique!<//Review>

I love this place so much especially Dr. Ataii, I  drive  over 2 hours to get to it. After searching for years to find a doctor that can take care of all my beauty needs,  take care of my laser hair removal, botox, and filler  all in one place. The staff is always so nice, and Dr. Ataii is patient in answering all my questions every time. He is highly skilled and makes all the work look so natural... I am so happy and grateful to him for my glowing and firm skin.<//text>

Ummmm WOW. I have always wanted a nose job but was too scared to get rhinoplasty. I was always scared I would end up with one of those botched nightmares and end up with a nose that I hate more than the one I already have. First of all, Dr. Ataii is amazing. He is super friendly, funny and made me feel comfortable. I had gotten botox somewhere else in La Jolla where they charged me $750 for 50 units (I was 27 at the time and don't have wrinkles that bad). He barely said anything to me in my consultation or explained what he was doing. My face was frozen and the only muscles that worked were the ones on the sides so when I made expressions I had the creepy raised eyebrow botox look. Dr. Ataii really took the time to explain what he would do, what my options were and what amounts should be used in order to achieve the natural look I wanted. He also worked with my budget and let me know what my options were and made me feel comfortable about it. He also did my lips which look perfect. If you have bird lips like me, getting juviderm will be the best thing you have ever done for yourself. THANK YOU DR. ATAII!!!<//Text>

Always a pleasure seeing Dr. Ataii and the entire staff. We've been clients since 2012 (when we first moved to San Diego) and we'll never go anywhere else.

Results are always fantastic with our Botox and Juvederm. We have also done Ultherapy and my wife did Coolsculpt...and those results were awesome!!!!!

Staff is very kind and helpful too.<//Text>

I love Laser Clinique! Coming from the East County, I was very intimidated when I first walked in, thinking this is only for the well off. The girls at the front desk and Doctor Ataii made me feel comfortable. He also lets you know what you're in for and what the results will be, within your comfort level. Thank you Laser Clinique!</Review>

Laser Clinique never disappoints.  Dr. Ataii is highly skilled and knowledgable, and offers personalized skin care for all skin types.  His knowledge and expertise are also reflected in the staff at Laser Clinique, who make me feel so comfortable at each visit and are highly educated on all of the non invasive cosmetic treatments offered.  When I arrive at Laser Clinique I am always welcomed like family and when I leave I look and feel amazing.  I highly recommend this facility.<//text>

Laser Clinique is the only place I refer my clients too. It's easy to schedule and the work is by far superior to any other. I feel confident as I age that I will be able to do it gracefully.

Thank you Laser Clinique,

<rating>5<//rating><Pics>None</Pics><review>I did a lot of research before coming to Dr Ataii...because you cant just trust getting work done by anyone.  Needless to say, I'm ecstatic with the results.  Dr. Ataii is immaculate in his process.  He was very knowledgeable about the procedure, and he explained everything he was doing, as we went along, so that I knew exactly what he was doing, and why he was doing it.  It was nice to know that it was a very well thought out process, which made me feel completely at ease.  Im really scared of needles, but it was so pain free. They really numb the area well before, and as for the results, they're super natural, and i just look like an enhanced version of myself.  The healing process was minimal, i was off to work the next day, and none was the wiser.

As for the establishment...super clean, top of the line, and well kept

As for the staff...very attentive, you can tell they're BIG on CUSTOMER SERVICE, they have an amazing complimentary massage chair, and they followed up with me the very next day to make sure everything went smoothly, I couldn't be happier with my results!<//review></record></dataset><record>

The Dr. was not clear on how the IPL works. He recommend it for me. I had 3 sessions. I have olive skin and IPL's are not usually recommend for my skin type. I had great skin before just wanted a couple of sun spots removed now I have horrible melasma that the IPL brought out. I also have two scars on my face from it.</text>

Excellent doctor and staff! Frequently go in for botox. Tried another doctor for botox who was a tad cheaper, and he hurt me as my eye could barely close and hurt for a solid week. I've never had a bad experience w/Laser Clinique. I love them and highly recommend!</review>

I recently visited Laser Clinics as I normally do every several months. I am so happy with the result! I feel Dr. Ataii is the best in the in soft facial lift medical filed. He is so natural and the way he chooses the spot to inject is superb, which makes your experience so comfortable! Some other doctors can do a good job, but the the process is painful. Dr. Ataii also keeps up with the new products and technology which are so important to be competitive in this field, especially in San Diego area where there are so many good doctors. Ataii certainly proves that he is one of the best!!

I recommend all of you who have not visited Dr. Ataii to go and have the first hand experience!

The staff is friendly and natural. You don't see a forced smile. They all are genuine!</text>

<Review>I've been going to Laser Clinique for about 3 plus years and am 100% completely satisfied!!!  After doing research and reading reviews I decided to give Laser Clinque a try and have never looked back!

First the doctor.......Dr. Ataii is a skilled and trained physician that specializes in skin care treatments.   He is completely dedicated to his patient's treatments and focuses on their own specific needs.  He is professional, knowledgeable, and has the most engaging and pleasant demeanor!

Second the office staff..... Whether it is a phone or in person encounter, patients are treated with the most welcoming demeanor - friendly, helpful, and completely knowledgeable!  The office staff and the way patients are treated are key, and they are a 5 star staff.

My treatments.... Dr. Ataii has given me botox, juverderm and age spot removal - all 100% successful for me!  I've always been extremely happy and satisfied with my skin care treatments.

All the reasons I have listed are the reasons I will continue to come to Laser Clinque and trust Dr. Ataii to all my skin care needs.  I will also continue to always recommend him -

Thank you!

I was getting Botox and Restlane from another doctor but was never satisfied with the results.  After my consultation I was certain I had chosen wisely.  Had Botox and juvederm and I was quite impressed with the lack of pain and instant results.  Best part was I had no bruising.  I am now considering doing Ultherapy and Coolsculpting before the summer.  Couldn't wait to tell my girlfriends</Text>< Pics>

I've had a few experiences with Laser Clinique which were all excellent and would recommend this clinic to anyone seeking a little "pick me up" or interested in anything they have to offer.

I've had experiences with;
laser hair removal, which was wonderful the staff made me feel comfortable and I had good results
botox- a little nerve racking at first but loved my results and far less painful then expected
juvederm- I wanted a little more volume in my lips, but not to look overstuffed or fake by any means. and it was right on target. loved it and am planning on going back for more when i need to!
and last but not least
Ultherapy- at first i thought it was all hocus pocus, but im a believer! i have seen amazing results in my neck and eyes! I was nervous about all those reviews that tell me it hurts, horrible pain ect, but that was not my experience with this clinic at all! their main concern was my comfort level and did what they could to make sure i wasnt in any pain! it was fantastic!< /Review>

<username>Bo Mersie<//username><Review>I have been going to this location for quite some time as it’s convenient for me. Management is poor and doesn’t seem to care about costumer service.
Most of the staff is extremely rude. A lot of times the drinks seem like they were made in a rush.. avoid. A little further down the street there’s another Starbucks. I recommend going there, as service is top notch.< /Review><pics>None</pics><gmapID>0x80c2be1fdfce307d:0x4f0022c3194f200b</gmapID></record>

<username>Dannielle Wallace< /username><Text>This is one of my favorite Starbucks in my area and that's saying a lot because I am surrounded by 5 and this would be the 6th that's going away from my house and before the 7th. You get it, there's so many!  All blocks away from one another and yet this locations staff,quality, cleanliness, service and coffee is the best hands down. Especially during Covid times I take all of these things into consideration even more and would recommend it over the others.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x80c2be1fdfce307d:0x4f0022c3194f200b<//gmapID>< pics>

<Text>This group is usually friendly and fast.   The only trouble is that there's always a line of cars out into the street.  I find it's easier to park close by and pick up at the walk up window.<//Text>< Response>

This drive-thru is often where I get my second cup of the day. There's no "inside" on this one but the small sitting area outside is a great spot to sip your drink on a sunny day.<//review>

< Review>
Manager Cheyenne has terrible customer service, no control over the location, and is extremely rude when you try to address this professionallly with her. Not Manager Material, obviously why this location has so many issues. I order daily.. Multiple locations... This one is always the worst. Stood there for 5 minutes staring at my drink... This location employees see a person at the window and hope someone else gets it. Always.</Review>

The staff at this location are amazing!! The drive thru line is always quick even if it does back up a few cars occasionally. It's still Starbucks so if you're some kinda coffee aficionado don't take my 5 stars to mean the coffee is any different than normal. The baristas are exceptionaly friendly and fast though and I've been to plenty of places to feel justified giving them the rating.<//text>

Starbucks. Convenient drive through or walk-up window. Got breakfast and a slice if their delicious Iced Lemon Poundcake.< /review>

<text>Drive thru enters from streets, if drive thru is full you might as well park an go in or find another Starbucks. When their drive thru is full it goes out to the streets where traffic is and that's very unsafe. If you wait in the middle divider which is in the middle of the street people will drive up and jump in the drive thru. Terrible location to have it in</text>< Date>

<Review>5 star for morning crew, 2 star for afternoon team at drive thru. The drive thru girl took my cash, then handed me my drink w her fingers dancing around about  the lid. I then asked her for another lid, in which she assulted the lid. I then tried to explain it to her, no she didn't wash her hands. No she didn't put gloves on. She gave me a smaller sized lid top that didn't fit the drink, in napkins😊. Before I could drive away she was busy complaining to her co worker, that I had the nerve to request a Covid free latte. Can't imagine what she does when no customers are around😒. Xtra hot i<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Today is May 10, 2019 time 10:16 am. I ordered two drinks online at 9:50 am and it took these people 25 minutes to make my drink. I had to wait outside for 25 minutes for these people to make my drinks and I had to remind them twice. They did not apologize for the wait even though I told them that I had seen people order their drinks after me and get their drinks before me. Screw this Starbucks and all the little kids who work there.< /Review>

Hmmmm good thing is drive tru, bad thing they don't do your orders right, and forget some of the order when you finally get to the window. And since your in a hurry you expect everything to be good, but I get we mess up some times.
If i ask for something i have gotten in another Starbucks I expected to be the same no? But no it seems like every Starbucks is different.... or they just find a away to not do it... is ok with more time I'll be back and help them make it.
And something that drives me crazy is when the coffee is not fill up to the top... or am I the only one?

I know is busy, but come on.

Thank you.</Text>

<review>Staff is always super nice but this location is pretty small. Parking isn't great in their lot and a lot of the people going through the drive-thru are inconsiderate to those trying to get out of the parking spots. So that's not fun.

This rating is just for this week.  I've had to return 3 times for incorrect orders...2 drinks and 1 good item (I ordered banana bread and got a bag full of oatmeal toppings).  Nice staff!  But they need to pay attention to what they are handing out.< /review>

They don't really serve coffee here. Service is usually pissed off or cheerful. Kind of 50/50 on whether you'll get coffee in your cup or not and/or get someone nice on the mic. But plus for it, it has a drive through. So yeah!<//Review>

You will wait forever!!  Even if you phone order ahead of time.  Multiple times I’ve waited 15 + minutes for a coffee.  Many times they have one barista running inside and out.<//review>

Between the attitude I typically get and only getting my coffee right half the time, I can't say I'll be coming back. There are some nice people who work here which is why it's a 2 star.

I don't know who manages this particular location, but whoever does seriously needs to hire more staff. EVERY TIME I come to this particular location they're always scrambling to stay on top of the orders. During my visit this evening the guy taking orders at the window said he was working with 2 new guys, 1 of which was on a break leaving only himself and 1 other new person to manage all the drive through and walk up orders. A few other people waiting for their order said they had already been waiting a good 20+ minutes for their drink. I finally cancelled my order and decided to walk to the statbucks on riverside/tujunga. Seriously, Starbucks? Can't blame the workers...they were doing their best but the management seriously needs to get their act together.<//review>

<Text>This is one of the slowest Starbucks that I have ever been to. And if you mobile order, which I do most of the time, this is NOT your store. I have sat there watching my drink melt while waiting for an employee to notice that I am there trying to pick up my order. If there is a long drive thru line, forget it. They are understaffed or under trained. Its disappointing too because it's so close to me.</Text>< Gmap_id>

This place should win as thee worst Starbucks everrrrr...

So I went to this Starbucks once, and once was already enough. I walked up to the kiosk, and asked the girl for a short decaf. The girl looked at me as if I was speaking Swahili, and my "complicated" order obviously confused her; so she consulted her manager. After I received my coffee, I needed to use the restroom. I waited and waited, because as I tried to open the door, it clearly seemed locked. After waiting over 20 minutes, I noticed nobody ever came out. So I overheard a guy asking the barrista at the kiosk about the toilet, and she said the door is really hard to open, and  to give the door a really hard kick. So he went in while I continued to wait. I went to sit down, and when he got out, I ran over there, and found the door was completely sealed shut, after several attempts to use my entire bodyweight to open it. Next thing I knew, my phone died, so I looked for an outlet, to plug in my charger. NO OUTLET! I asked the barrista and she said they didn't have any! Whaaaat? A Starbucks with no outlets?! Never heard that before! I didn't get it; ok, they were a drive through, but there were at least 8 outdoor tables, many with awnings, so clearly people do sit and chill there, and I'm sure some use their phones/ computers etc. No outlets!! Blew my mind. This Starbucks is a joke. Its loaded with inconveniences; incompetent barristas who have never heard of decaf coffee, a restroom door that requires a demolition to open it, and no bloody outlets to recharge devices. Won't be back anytime soon, that's for sure.< /review>

Had to wait 20 minutes this Saturday morning to get my mobile order. Why do you guys write 3-8 minutes if you can't deliver? Why not write 15-20 minutes then? And if you do write 3-8 minutes, why not get enough staff to deliver your promises?< /review>

Our family loves Hillside!  It is a contemporary Christian community.  Very relevant in addressing our everyday struggles and how Scripture guides us into hope rather than despair and anxiety(which many of us experience all too often).    We think you’ll really enjoy attending and hopefully participating deeper in the Hillside Community to get supported in your life journey!</Text>

<text>I have been part of this church for 8 years, since we moved to the US. We didn't have friends or close family in town, but the people from this church became our best friends and family. We feel love and care for. The doctrine is healthy and the pastors and worship team do a great job ministrating. They have an amazing children's & youth ministry.<//text><Date>1541616283290< /Date>< Pictures>

<Review>- Does Not Support Those With Disabilities.-
I am disabled and used the church van to get to services on Sundays. There is a lot of mean-spirited gossip on the van to church that is not corrected.
I never really was made to feel welcome or truly part of the congregation. I felt shunned by the church leadership. I suffer from depression and a loving, accepting Christian church is what I need... I did not find this at Hillside Christian Church.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>After trying my best to defend the disabled I found myself being screamed at by the Senior Pastor with him threatening to revoke my membership I left in tears and never went back.  I found this a horrible UnGodly experience. In the year I went to this church I found countless times where I felt the heartlessness of the staff, volunteers and whoever else was active on any said Sunday. While yes there were a few that I will always be grateful to many treated me and countless others as  outcast and also played a game of favoritism. I feel the way this church handles its van services, voting of board members ,finances, and home based bible studies among other things unjust and UnGodly, and the care of the disabled and those in need is very wrong and this church needs desperately to have a class or something and restructure themselves on how to adequately and prayerfully remember who they are and who they represent. Jesus would never have done the things that I saw this church do instead he would have bent down and carried the sick , prayed and basically gone that extra mile for them< /Text>< Pictures>

Hillside Christian is a beautiful blessing to both Les and I.
The pastorial staff and the church's values and mission are a testimony to the faithful discipleship of the teachings of Our Lord Christ Jesus.</Review>

Very nice building and campus but not friendly. Also they teach the false doctrine of Faith only for salvation.< /text>

< Review>
Billy and the team at Coconut Funding are by far my favorite people. Since meeting them and beginning our working relationship, they have taken the time to explain each process and have made the process as painless a possible. Billy will go above and beyond the call of duty to insure that I have received the best possible care. I can't thank them enough for their belief in me and my company and they truly care about their customers. I am forever grateful.</Review>

Lots of fake reviews from these foreign scammers here. I just got a spam email from these Coconut guys and decided to look them up. Go to this address and try to find their office. I dare you. Only deal face to face in matters of funding. Not online.< /Text>

<Text>Our business keeps getting calls from Chris, who is very rude. We have stated multiple times to put us on their "Do Not Call" list. Half way through that sentence now, Chris will hang up on us. When I have stated that he has called us multiple times he goes into denial and makes excuses. There isn't an excuse, just stop calling us.</Text><Time>1623871336738</Time>< user_id>

<time>1594648484981< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I have been using cash advance companies ever since they started up when the banks stopped lending money to small businesses that did not have perfect credit or great daily account balances.

I have used Business Financial Services and Business Baker and both companies have given me cash advances but they always treat you as if you were some kind of criminal and their "due process" is ridiculous-they forget that we are doing them a favor buy accepting their cash at the high interest rate-at least a loan shark is honest about the fact that they are in the usury business-all these cash advance companies make believe that they are legitimate financial institutions.

So anyway at least the guys at Coconut are relaxed and realistic about who they are and understand what it is like for us to be running a small business in this day and age and they have always treated me as an equal and never looked down their nose at me like Business Financial Services and Business Baker have done.

These guys are are always in contact with me and anytime I need cash for something they are willing to help and their technology is the best-no printing out forms or getting them notarized or scanning or faxing documents back-everything they do is with docusign and all you need to do is to "click-click-click" and the money appears in your bank account the next day just like the tooth fairy leaves money under a kid's pillow!

< Review>
This company is totally legit. I thought it was to good to be true, but they came through for me. The process was fair. They are really willing to help small companies get to the next level. I was pleasantly surprised on multiple situations. My particular set of circumstances was unique. They gave me a deal that I was more than pleased with.

Thank you Mr. Pearlman!</Review>

I've taken 7 cash advances over the last 3 years. These guys simply do the best job...bar none.

They actually care about getting you the best rate possible unlike most of their competitors.

And yes, I'll be going back again.</Text>

If you enjoy continuous emails (that you never asked for) that start to border harassing from a company that you've never heard of and probably had to google just so you could find out who is constantly in your inbox, THEN THIS IS THE COMPANY FOR YOU! For me, the more stuff you send me the more I will insist to others not to do business with you. I've never done business with this business and I assure you that I never will. Nor am I in the market for financing of any kind. But don't worry, no matter how many times you tell them that, the phone calls and emails will still continue.< /text>

Very bad experience with Coconut Funding, and I would like to be able to give them negative stars at this point. I had genuinely believed that they were honorable people in the beginning, then I found that they do not actually care what happens to our business once they feel that they have a contract in place(and it doesn't even seem to matter to them who signs for it either). Our business was taken advantage of, and then fraudulent paperwork was filed. The really sad part is that I actually wanted to resolve the matter with them, and work together with them to come up with a solution, but they refuse to even communicate and respond. It is really disappointing for me. Please be careful in dealing with them, I fear that they may have destroyed any chance that we have to continue operating at all.<//Review>

When I received a call #2, I picked up and said that I demand they stop calling me and take my name off the list. Guess what! They told me I was rude!

<Review>The Best and only company I will work with ever!
In the past I've had bad experiences with funding companies taking advantage of my business or just being total sharks and unprofessional. However Coconut Funding and more specifically Jenna the Beast Banko and Zach the MAN Glosserman really are knowledgeable, accurate and fast. Gave me deal I wanted with the terms I asked for. Couldn't be happier and as my business couldn't be as productive. I have and will continue to refer business and endorse these guys! Aloha!

I had a rather challenging file to get approved for funding, primarily because my business was still very new, and with a limited amount of monthly statements I was able to provide. Rob Pearlman, Zachary Glosserman, and the rest of their team have great relationships with their investors and kept pounding the table and were able to get me funded. Great work gentlemen, and thank you for remaining diligent and leaving no stone unturned in your search to find me what I needed. Highly recommend, seriously - if they can't get it done nobody can. Thumbs way up!</Review>

<Review>There are those who try - and there are those who do. The difference is how dedicated you are to what you do and how efficient you do it. It is hard to work with people sometimes - harder when their situation may not be financially easy to work with. But people - is your business. You treat them right and do the best you can, given the situations.

That is why we do business.

Thank you,

Oly G.</Review>< time>

<review>I received funding from this company years ago...That was fine...but for the past few months I have been hounded with phone calls on my business and personal cell phone.  I have been emailed over and over by various people constantly.  I have asked them numerous times to stop contacting me and stop emailing me...but they have not listened and continue to harass me..  I typically do not give negative or 1 star reviews, but this company is ridiculous. I tell them I have no need to borrow money and they still want to see my last 4 months of my bank statements..why???  Stop harassing former customers...that's why we are former customers...we do not want to work with you.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

If you need this kind of loan use LoanBuilder or Kabbage...they are crazy high but at least legitimate finance companies and transparent.  This Coconut Funding company is just boiler room scammers, the honolulu address isn't even  a real office it's a "rented work space".</Review>

This place is an absolute joke. I had about 5 different reps call me trying to seal a deal.

As we worked through the process (which I didnt really want to do anyway, as they called me, not the other way around), they kept reassuring my how competitive their rates are. HA!

The rep calls me and says they can do 51k with an 8 month payoff total 68k. Yea. You read that right.

I use kabbage (who are ridiculously high as well) but their rate is HALF of what cocaNUTS wanted to charge.<//review>

Very unprofessional, rude and lack or organization company. They solicited on us and when we requested that we only will take a long term loan with monthly payments I was misled by a guy named George that they do offer that product but after sending all requested documents they offered me a very high payback loan with short term and daily payments so I rejected the offer and requested to be reviewed by a long term loan a guy named Jacob Pearlman, who I later learned is one of the owners, sent me a very rude email judging me for a foreclosure that appear in my credit and blaming me for not paying that mortgage. That's is not a professional answer, when a company denies credit to someone they are not supposed to point the finger and blame customers for specific items on their credit but simply say something like: "Your credit history is not enough to qualify for a loan", period! that's it no pointing fingers, don't kicking people in the butt for stuff they don't even know why it happened. They don't even know what they are doing, this morning I received a call from another representative asking me to complete the application, Come on! I have already rejected the offer so how can someone else ask me to provide more information to process the loan. They are probably shuffling customer information from one person to the other in their office and they don't know the status of the loan. This company definitely sucks, avoid doing business with this crooks!<//review>

My company received a cold call from a representative named Steve.  I told Steve we did not need his business, I asked him to take us off the call list.  After doing so Steve was giving a lot of disrespect towards me saying if i was the owner and was told not to take his call.  He is very unprofessional and does not know how to handle himself on the phone.  When calling back to speak with a manager, they contacted me to Steve first who then hung up on me.</Text>

This is a miserable company that calls and harasses my place of work and all of our other franchise locations, constantly, despite our many complaints. We have tried calling and asking to be removed from their call list more than once, but they still constantly pester every one of our stores. They literally will call one store after another asking us something about borrowing money from them, which we have declined repeatedly. When we tell them no they completely ignore us and respond only with the pushiest sales tactics I've ever encountered from a company. It is impossible to get off the phone with them because of this without simply hanging up. And when you do hang up the same exact person calls back in less than 5 minutes and you have to go through the entire process again. They are nothing more than a nuisance. Do not use this company, please, I beg you.< /Text>

Horribe people to do business with from Zachary Glosserman who is one of the reps that he has a fake review on here to jesse anderson another rep that is jason anderson who put a review on here also, weve been trying to close a deal for over two 3 weeks now, and no resolve, they will not answer the phone every time i call the lady that answers the phone screens there calls and tells us that they are on the phone and they will get back to you, they never do, from emails to phone calls no response the funny thing about it is all they have to say that they cannot fund me but they constantly say that there working on it, but never get a resolve, and the lady who answers the phone there wants you to tell her everything so that they can screen the call to see if they want to answer it, so you have to tell her everything, so if or when they decide to get on the phone you have to repeat everything again to them absolutely a joke and will never ever do business with these coco-nuts again.</review>

< review>
Having to use a funding company is not something I wanted to experience, but hurricanes interrupted business and cash flow so badly in summer 2017 that I felt that I had no other choice. And once you get into the situation of paying back money at an exorbitant cost in a very short period of time, you may likely find that you have to get funding again in order to cover the cash flow for the debt service. And if you get funding from one company, then concurrent funding from additional companies will be priced even higher and/or shorter terms.
If you ever use one funding company, you will be bombarded with solicitations from hundreds salesmen (they call themselves "consultants" or "brokers") with a wide variety of email addresses, UIRL's and phone numbers. Many of these brokers claim to be "direct lenders", but most are not, so don't be fooled by expecting that you will get a better deal thinking that a "direct lender" will not cost as much without a broker's commission. It seems as though they are selling pretty much the same program from a few actual funding companies. These funding companies are not banks, they are investors who hope that the unsecured credit that they extend will be paid back, and, hopefully, within the agreed time frame. And if you don't contract with the broker/salesman/funding company that you talked to, it seems that they share your information with many others so you will be solicited by many, many others. Most of these people are very aggressive, so I assume that their commissions must be incredible. If they get your telephone number, they will use every stunt to get past your receptionist, or, if they get your cell phone number you can expect calls and texts many times per week and even in the evenings.
All of them will ask you to fill out an application (and funny how there seems to be only a couple of variations of applications, like they all share the same web page). After the application, proposals are made. Disregard the offers that you get in the mail or email before you fill-out the application, it is only a come-on to get your attention, even if they say "approved" or "pre-approved".
Then, when you negotiate and agree upon a deal verbally and/or in writing, most turned out to be come-ons that were modified or turned down by the "underwriter" on the day that the money was supposed to be sent. I think that they assume that you are over a barrel and have to take whatever you can get at that point.
Having said all that, I have found that Coconut Funding's people are actually much more direct and less B.S. than most of the others. And, most importantly, they honor the deals that they agreed upon.< /review>

Thank You, Rob & Zack for putting together a loan that made it possible to sleep a little easier, knowing I have some breathing room.

We are SO SO SO very tired of getting unwanted solicitation phone calls from this business! We tell them EVERY time, to please take us off our list! They just call again later that day, and continue every single day!
Today, the owner answered the phone and reiterated to STOP calling us, only to have them call us back and ARGUE with him, and called 4 MORE times in the span of 60 seconds! We will NEVER do business with a company that would treat people this way...< /Text>

got a loan when was desperate, they keep calling on cell phone to offer more, for over 20 months as much as i beg them to take me off their list they still keep harassing on the cell phone, so if you are desperate for money just get a loan with them and be bound to their harassment for the rest of your life< /text>

<Text>The day I brought my very sick kitty cat into their office it was standing room only and went all the way outside and all the girls handle the stress and the demands of the clients extremely well and were very professional. The vet was also very professional and kind and wanted to help my kitty Sheba by doing bloodwork and not starting her on any medication until we knew what was wrong with her. I would recommend Trinity Pet Hospital. I left there feeling very confident that my kitty Sheba was in good hands.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_VeFhkkqYnlmzZIo2PHNCMwKmbathX5wywlN0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

My baby was spayed yesterday by Trinity Pet Hospital.
The staff were very knowledgeable in regards to the procedure. I left knowing my pet was in good hands.
Prices are VERY reasonable!!
I’m happy that they called to see how my doggy was doing today

(Sleeping soundly) 🐶♥️

***  If you’re thinking about taking your pet there, REALIZE that animals, like people react differently to stressful situations.
Sadly, Stress can cause death in our beloved pets ***

Don’t let my photos scare you
It’s normal, after surgery for your animal to be groggy, confused and a little F*CKED UP lol<//text>

I had a wonderful experience with Trinity pet Hospital. I neutered my dog. He was in pain the first day after the surgery. I called them and helped my dog as soon as posible. Very efficient  and affordable price.</Text>

Recently moved back to the area from New York & was looking for a new vet & Trinity was recommended from a family member. I could not be happier with the kindness & service I have received from Trinity. The ladies at the desk & the vets are so helpful and knowledgeable! I was so nervous I would not be able to get my pet neutered before he turned 1, as every other vet is booked for months, and when the doctor realized he was almost 1, he took it upon himself to help me and get a me a date before my dogs birthday ( and the price is amazing )! I can not express enough how much of a blessing they have been! I would recommend them to every pet owner!<//Text>

<username>Corina Williams</username><text>Excellent animal care and value. My vet wanted almost $600 for neutering my 2 cats. i saved more than $400 at Trinity which was incredible. The fact that this vet office is always full could only be because the care and service is outstanding as opposed to empty vet offices. so i didn’t mind waiting at all.</text>< userid>

I was in a bind because I was visiting my family for the weekend and away from my usual vet. I noticed my dog had been kinda off… her appetite and energy level decreased, and she had a really sensitive back - just the slightest touch would have her yelping. We found Trinity Pet Hospital and called and luckily they were able to squeeze us in as a walk-in the next day. I couldnt have been more relieved because I know vets are usually way booked in advance and its pretty unusual for them to take walk-ins. The day of, we noticed the clinic was sooo busy - yet they still were able to squeeze us in after about an hour of waiting! The vet was so nice and helpful and did a thorough exam on her. Turns out she had a severe allergic reaction and scabs formed all over her back, but they got her all cleaned up and made sure there wasnt any internal problems going on as well. All done within a few hours - and without even an appointment! The meds that they sent me home with had very clear instructions and were so effective, she was back to her normal self the next day.  I so appreciate the staff at Trinity and their amazing care!</Text>

I have been going here for a long time and do appreciate Trinity, but this time around I had an emergency and rushed in......and still had to wait over an hour in the waiting room with my pet crying in pain while other customers discussed the weather with the staff, asked random questions about best types of leashes or where the best dog parks are located.   I don’t want to “cut in line” and I’m very respectful of the process, but during an emergency, there should be some sense of urgency, and there wasn’t. My pet suffered terribly for more than an hour while non emergency general appointments or relaxed nonchalant conversations took place with no concern.   It broke my heart and I was disappointed this time around.<//Review>

This vet is not low cost they will demand you but things or services u do not need and if you say no they will not care for your pet.  They are rude and they will lie and scam you to try and raise the bill to line their pockets.  They care about money over caring for pets.
RUN DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS PLACE CUZ THEY ARE DESPERATE AND DONT CARE OF HOW THEY TREAT YOU.</Review>

I trust Dr kerolos with my cats and dogs he is very knowledgeable and extremely caring  . He saved my cat from full blockage when he was younger and many years later when my cats body was ready to cross over he helped him cross over while I was comforting my baby .  The only vet and clinic I trust with my babies . So grateful for the care and knowledge of this doctor and staff . My dog had his dental surgery there recently , he is a 4lb dog and I was nervous but all went wonderfully no complications and his recovery was so quick and painless.

I HIGHLY  recommend this clinic and doctor.<//Text>

I’ve gone to other veterinarians, but I was not satisfied with them.  When I come to Trinity Hospital, my dog and I are treated like family. I recently moved  from the area and traveled 45 miles to come to Trinity Hospital because they know my dog and her condition and they take good care of her.  They are definitely reliable and dependable.<//review>

Very friendly staff and vet. They were able to squeeze my dog in to be seen as an emergency, gave him treatment and so far, he's feeling all better.  They also took the time to call the next day to make sure he was doing ok.</Review>

<Review>I love this place and so do a lot of other people, so getting an appointment to spay mama cat and her 5 kittens before they would go into heat was impossible and I took them elsewhere.

Their prices are affordable, but again, they are busy so expect to wait awhile.  Dr. K and the vet techs are really good and efficient; the front office staff is BUSY so normally don't have time to happy talk with you, but have to handle busy phones as well as the people in front of them.<//Review><name>Susan Seroski<//name><Resp>None<//Resp>< rate>

They not only live up to this but they exceed it by also treating the pet parent as family. They are understanding of different financial situations and due not pressure you into unnecessary test and proceedures just to make a buck. I reccomend this place to anyone who ask about a good vet online and I always will even if that means sometimes I have to wait to get an appointment, LOL! The staff are amazing and they truly look and sound like they love their job everytime I go in. Thank you Trinity for showing me that not all vets are money hungry corporations.

<review>There isn't enough time or space for me to list the endless number of positive experiences I've had with Dr K and his team.  Dr. K has always provided my furry babies with EXCELLENT care and he hands down saved my 2 year old english bulldogs life when she contracted pneumonia during the onset of the pandemic.  The treatment plan and care she received while under Dr. K's care was lifesaving and it didn't cause me to file bankruptcy either!  His services are top notch at prices that are typically much less than any other vet in the area.  Dr. K, I think you are the GREATEST and I APPRECIATE your kind, caring and compassionate care more than I can ever express in words.</review>< Response>

Dr K and his staff are simply the most caring Vets we have ever seen.
Good value, is rare to find, and the level of personal attention and love that Dr K lavishes on our Dogs make them WANT to see him.

< review>
Pet Caregivers at Trinity Pet Hospital with Maged Kerolos have been my friends for over ten years. Everyone at Trinity that I have met have cared for my pets with a loving touch. Anyone sitting in the lobby feels an immediate friendship with those bringing in their pets for assistance. There is a trust that has built up over the years which keeps me bringing all my little critters to see Dr. Kerolos...connie< /review>

It has been years since I have been this impressed with a service provider. I was a Banfield customer for 20 years and I always dreaded going in, knowing that they were going to pressure, manipulate, and GUILT me into buying unnecessary tests and procedures. I knew what my pet needed and without telling the Trinity physician all that happened at the other hospital, his assessment was perfect. He was clear as to what the treatment plan was, the cost that would be involved, the follow up care needed, and didn't hide anything. They were very busy in the lobby, but they ran this business like a fine-tuned machine. My cat's surgery went well and his prognosis is excellent! Kathrine and the front desk crew triaged and handled more than two dozen pets being checked in within what seems like less than an hour of opening. They sent us home with clear aftercare instructions! The nurses and the treating physician,, Dr. Kerolos, are amazing. I highly recommend this Hospital/ Veterinarian.<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Resp>

I’ve been taking my three dogs here several years now and I’ve always had a good experience with the staff and the service I received. The on-site doctor is wonderful. You can tell he truly is an animal lover, so compassionate and caring. I never feel rushed and after the visit I always get a follow up phone call from a member of the staff. Great job yall!🐶😃<//Review>

Overall pretty good but I didn’t appreciate the fact that once I was given an estimate of charges, I was goi g to be charged double the price for medication as opposed to what I could get it for online or at Costco. After discussing the plan, I asked for a written prescription for my dog and filled it at Costco for literally half the price. Always check online for prices before signing off on the estimate if medications are involved. Especially now, people’s money is tight and I know we all could stand to save a few bucks here and there.< /Text>

Trinity has taken care of our 15 year old Havanese dog for the last 3 years and they are extremely honest, accurate with all their diagnosis and loving with our dog.  If you want high quality pet care at a reasonable price, then Trinity is the place to go.  Trinity was highly recommended to us and I would highly recommend them to anyone.<//review>

<Review>Trinity is a very busy animal hospital but for good reasons. They are accommodating and professional and so friendly. And Dr. Kerolos was absolutely wonderful and gentle and knowledgeable. I had to bring my dog there and although the news was not good, Dr. Kerolos took the time to go through everything and did not suggest any outrageous tests to run up the bill. And they followed up a couples times to check in on how my dog was doing afterwards. I highly recommend Trinity and will definitely take our next ones there.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< user>

<text>CAT KILLER!!!!!!!
IF YOU WANT YOUR PET DEAD TAKE HIM HERE. I had a 100% healthy Persian cat, a baby 1 year old and Dr. Magot Kerolos Preformed neutering on my cat, a day later I had called the hospital concerned and the business day after I took my cat into the hospital they told me he was 100% healthy. The next day he got worse, the doctor said it was due to stress on the cat, he charged me another 800$ and he over dosed my cat on Anesthesia, and he called me the same day saying he died. he has no soul no heart. Had no care in the world. He didn't even apologize.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Although they were busy, and the doctor was in surgery, they told us to come back in 45 minutes and would squeeze Walter in. They stuck to their word even though the office got super busy once the doc was out of surgery. I really appreciate business like that!

Kitty toe chop shop . In their FAQ  page online about declawing they are blatantly lying about stuff like "Declawing does not change your cat's behavior" They also call it "removing claws". It's not removing claws, folks. It's amputation of the entire last toe digit, an amputation. Multiply that by 10. FYI the reason a cat needs to stay at least overnight after having it's toes amputated is so that the owners won't hear them scream in agony when they come out of anesthesia. Don't declaw.<//Review>

<Time>1567884246502<//Time><Review>We use this hospital to neuter our kitten. and all the goodies listed below for just $60, blood-work for $50 is optional but we did it.
Everything just perfect - quick smooth scheduling, answer all questions patiently and honestly, small paperwork upon arrival. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. We drop  off our boy  at 7 a.m. and pick him up after 5 p.m. Was a little wait about 15 minutes for drop-off and pick-up, but hospital staff manage everything nicely, no one was unattended. Hospital provide us with 3 pain-killer doses and very detailed aftercare instruction.
and one more time - the neutering was $60 compare to other clinics charge ($300-$500) for same.
Thank you for your service Trinity Pet Hospital and God bless you.
Happily yours

I arrived at Trinity Pet Hospital the day after Labor Day as a walk-in with a sick dog. Even though I did not have an appointment they fit us in after a reasonable wait. The staff there is very friendly and knowledgable. Dr. Kerolos saw us after a short wait and was very thorough. Dr. Kerolos has been our  vet for many years and I've always been happy with his services. I highly recommend Dr. Kerolos.<//review>

We have brought our dogs here many times for both routine and emergency visits. Most every dog or pet has issues at some point and it’s great to have a place that provides  Reasonable prices and an honest assessment of the dog’s illness. They gave us several options to help us make the right decisions. Highly recommend.< /Text>

I LOVE TRINITY Hospital.  This is the best pet clinic.  I have 3 cats and 1 dog and they treat my babies like family.  The front desk is always so patient and kind.  Dr. Kerolos is wo9nderful and has such a great and warm personality.  I highly recommend Trinity Pet Hospital<//text>

I brought my cat here for dental cleaning due to her gingivitis. They were ahead of schedule, and kept me updated once she was finished giving me enough time to return while the anesthesia wore off. I also saved hundreds of dollars from the prices quoted in Hollywood where I live. Worth the drive!

<Review>We were referred to Trinity Pet Hospital by a friend, and we are so very thankful! We had a little emergency with our Romeo, as he had caught his nail, and it was hanging by a thread. The staff at Trinity was excellent! And Doctor not only did a fine job with Romeo's claw, he also removed a small growth while he was under anesthesia. We now call Trinity our vet- for all THREE of our pups! We could not be happier! <3 Below is Rome waiting to see his new Doctor..<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0Tsnl3Nv9IdqARXh8VDl4PLuNMUuFH6BpkYS0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJYvYiDWv6Tobma99bTmvor6kwyEuUZei4lRW1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

Thank you so much for taking care of our dog, Diogi. He went in to get neutered and I was impressed by how welcoming the staff was. They were busy but very accommodating to everyone. They informed me every detail of the process and answered any questions I had. When I picked him up, he obviously did not like the cone but he was so happy walking out. They gave me step by step instructions on his aftercare. The Vet called this morning to check on his progress and glad to inform he is doing great. Still not a fan of the cone but he's healing well.<//text>

We recently moved to the area from out of state and a family member recommended this place. We were running out of medication for our 14yo dog and needed a refill. They were able to get us in quickly and it was pricey but whatever, that wasn’t the priority for us. Next time around and I need refills, I also had a question about my dog’s diet. A very simple question. I wasn’t worried about my dog eating bc he’s always been a bit of a picky eater but he has kidney issues and what we feed him is important. I asked if they could recommend some snacks or other alternatives I could give my dog when he’s not in the mood to eat (and to reiterate, he’s gone through not eating phases his entire life with no medical issues as validated bf prior vets but now he’s on a special diet). They said well in order to advise you on that, you have to bring him in for an exam. Okay, no problem. My appt was at 415 and I had my 4yo too so time is slightly more critical. Check in was a disaster. They were so unorganized and running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They made everyone stand outside of the office to check in. Why not accept phone calls? Then, after 45 min of waiting after check in, they finally take my dog. I make it clear I need medicine (which I could have gotten without bringing my dog) but the only reason my dog is there is so the vet can give me some good snack alternatives for my elderly dog. Another 45 minutes later, they come out and give me the bill but no dog or meds or medical advice. About 30 minutes later they come out with my dog and the pills and basically throw it at me (not literally but metaphorically here) and that’s it. I didn’t talk to the vet once. When I asked about literally the only thing I brought him for, they said well we can have you talk to the vet but that will be another 25 minutes. WHAT. Absolutely not. My 4yo was crying bc she had to pee and I was livid. It was a circus but there was no entertainment and it was way too expensive with the office clearly doing whatever they can to make money off of the customers without adding value. The management operations were clearly run by folks who have zero experience because there’s no rhyme or reason and zero efficiency or thought of the customer experience. There are too many vets out there to suffer through any more visits at Trinity. We switched to a different vet in RSM and WOW what a night and day experience. They were friendly, thoughtful, efficient, and more affordable.< /review>

The staff is always efficient ! And knows what they’re doing. And yes, it seems like there’s always a wait and crowded, but he’s just a really honest veterinarian that does NOT up sale you. I had 2 other vets before a friend recommended him. And I’ve taken my dog here for 10 yrs now. There’s a reason why there is a long line. People trust him !<//text>

Other vets haven't allowed me to bring my pets in during covid, and our pets need us to advocate for them. Dr K is very experienced and loving with my little dog. Reasonable price, and they waived the exam fee with our 1st visit! They're busy! And I can see why.<//Text>< pics>

I almost had to give away my cute little doggie due to extreme dental requirements that was quoted in the thousands of dollars until I was recommended to try Trinity - they were able to take care of the issues for about 50% less. I have enjoyed good veterinary services every since for the last three years. I strongly recommend Trinity.< /review>

Awesome!! Trinity/Dr.K was recommended to us by a friend. When our pup GSD was having some loose stool, we decided to go for a visit. The staff and Dr. K couldn't have been nicer! Friendly faces greeted us as we walked in and was treated with kindness and respect the entire time. Dr. K did not seem rushed and spent time answering all of our questions (and we had plenty). We will definitely be back to Trinity Pet Hospital for our future visits.</review>

I’ve been going to Trinity Pet Hospital for over 6 years and I’d go nowhere else. I actually met a stranger at a post office who recommended Trinity when my dog was new to us and I’ve been a loyal customer ever since.  Dr Kerolos and his staff are always super attentive and compassionate and their prices are incredibly reasonable.  My little dog just got bit by another dog yesterday.  They took my dog right in, listened to my story, examined him and  fortunately no serious injury.  And the facility is very clean.  I’d definitely try them before you go to another one with expensive prices.  Thanks Trinity staff! 😊</Text>

Appointments are easily made and once I am there, it has always been a straightforward process, completed in a decent amount of time.  My husband and I have always felt that necessary attention has been given in regards to whatever condition we are there for.  I tell anyone who is looking for a vet to go there.  We have used Trinity Pet Hospital for three years with two of our pets and will happily continue to do so.<//Text>

< review>
Catherine, the manager at Trinity Pet Hospital, was very unprofessional & shouldn't be a manager for this office.  Note:  the Doctor is generous, kind and highly competent.   I called around 9am twice to get 2 prescriptions refilled and asked for a prescription so everything is ready to minimize contact due to COVID-19. The gentleman & the lady that answered the phone said they will be ready in an hour or two.  I showed up at 2 pm to give them plenty time and only 1 prescription was filled.  Then, I expressed my frustration and asked why they were not ready.  Catherine, the manager, attacked me verbally saying their office does not refill prescription when called in.   She also stated I can get the refill or a prescription and not both.  She said I called her office a "liar".  Basically her story and the morning call were totally different.  When I told her I called in b/c I'm trying to minimize contact due to COVID-19.  Then, she said her office was doing me a favor by allowing me into the lobby to pick up the medicine b/c they are putting themselves at risk every day.  I agree the staffs are putting themselves at risk.  As a manager, she should look for way to minimize contact (i.e. curbside pickup).  I went to this office 3 times during COVID and I don't see this office is doing anything to minimize contact.   Therefore, she's an incompetent manager.    To add to my frustration, Catherine also overcharged one of my prescription by $20 so I had to ask her to recount both refills.  Note:  the bottle stated 20 pills and Catherine charged me for 30 pills.  In summary, you might want to record your conversation so Catherine wouldn't call you a liar.  I'm taking my dog here b/c the doctor has helped my dog....</review>

Thank you so much Trinity! You all are amazing. The Vet who owns this clinic Has a LOVE for animals and it is very apparent that stopping the procreation of PUPPIES is important to him. He did not gouge us like most vet clinics do. There was no unnecessary lab work or even exams when the sole purpose is just to neuter an animal. I was able to get my two male poodles neutered for an unbelievable price WITHOUT compromising care. The staff was professional and my dogs did great and was even sent home with pain meds. One day later they are playful and doing great. I called eight vet clinics and all wanted over $300-$600 to neuter a healthy 10 pound dog. I didnt pay anywhere near that.

Thank you Trinity Pet Hospital for the work you do!

<text>Trinity Pet Hospital is the very BEST I have EVER been to!  The Vets they have there are fair and honest and they don't overcharge! Also, the Vets really communicate well what is going on with your pet. I have been going there for YEARS and I REALLY TRUST them! I hope they make it thru this COVID crisis ... because we all NEED them!<//text><UserId.>108888745675376322828</UserId.><pictures>None< /pictures>< time>

I now have been taking my American Eskimo "Max" to Trinity pet Hospital for about 9 years now (he is 10 years old now). Dr. K is one of the best. He provides the best care for Max. The staff is friendly, kind and caring. Very happy with the care and service I receive and highly recommend them.</Text>

<review>They were great in rechecking my dog after his surgery. We experienced a problem a week later and they were very accommodating and letting me bring the dog in just for a double check.
They are dealing with continued COVID-19 issues. So while they have to meet you outside to get your dog, there is a wait outside so if you happen to have an easy folding chair to take with you it makes the wedding a lot easier.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>Best Vet ever. Very involved with you and your pet. Always takes time with you to answer any of your questions/concerns. The staff is always friendly, caring and professional. I have recommended Trinity to many of my friends and now they are recommending Trinity.

Samme has been coming to Trinity Pet since he was 3 months old.  He is now 6 years old and he is a very healthy and happy little boy.
Samme is a therapy dog and we take him to skilled nursing homes, schools, and libraries where kids read to the dogs.  Since he is exposed to such a large group it is important that he is update with his shots and his overall health  Trinity keeps his records update and always reminds me when it is time to update his health appointment and shots. The Vet and staff are the best.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMLxcdk7d1d2sIRHtP7kp_dOlTP80T_bOpqtdf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dce8d8d66c0de7:0xc564599985d1f0c8< /gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Made an appointment, waited a week and a half.  When I got there I had to wait an hour past my appointment time.  I asked why and they told me they had a lot of walk ins that morning.  Why did I bother making an appointment if they let walk ins go first.  I like the doctor and the staff but they need to prioritize those who take the time to make an appointment and let the walk ins wait .  I made the appointment so I could get in and out quickly with the virus problems.  My spouse has COPD and I didn't want to catch anything and take it home.</Review>

I also Took a look at the incision and it is very clean and seems to be giving the cat very little discomfort. A + all around :) keep up the fantastic service</Review></record></dataset><record>

Love this office.  Vets are excellent prices are fair and my pet always seems in good hands.   Just one complaint, I always have an appointment and I always have to wait a really long time.   We  were there for 45 min. before being seen with an appointment, then the service took less than 1/2 hour.  We spent around 2 hours there and went in for a Rabies shot and check up.  We added ear cleaning.< /Text>

Definitely not recommend, very awkward experience with waiting an hour to see a vet that saw my animal for 3 minutes or less. I felt as if multiple medications were immediately pushed just to make money. Oh yeah and while i was in the waiting room, the two receptionist women were talking badly about other customers that were just there while I was in the room waiting. It was the most uncomfortable situation ever, and I contemplated leaving while I was waiting.</Text>

This is THE MOST OUTSTANDING Veterinary Clinic I have ever been to!  They truly care about their "patients" and their human owners.  They are thorough, kind and will ALWAYS make time for a sick or injured pet.  AND, they are reasonably priced!!!  They take walk-ins, which is amazing, but they care THAT much! We drive from Costa Mesa... that's how great they are. :)<//Text>

They are alway so nice and helpful, doing the best for both humans and animals. We have neutered our two Shar-Pei's and put one of them to sleep and they were the best that you ever could imagine.</text>

My Australian cattledog had developed severe itching and was chewing on himself. Under a recommendation I took him to the Trinity Vets where they examined , diagnosed and treated him promptly. After several days he appears to no longer have the issues that was annoying him. The personnel at Trinity showed care and compassion. I highly recommend them for your pets.</Review>

Fast, knowledgeable and truly servicing the good of veterinary medicine without trying to overcharge you or do unnecessary procedures.  They also price their care so people can actually have their pet treated and not be put in a position of paying rent or helping their best friend.
Well done Trinity, you've got a new patient for life.</Text>

Great and fast service for my old English bulldog Charley. this has to be the most professional vet I have ever been too. the girls at the front desk are very nice and smart and get everything taken care of. TOP notch service and top notch care from the Doctor as well. he is very professional. I have nothing but amazing things to say about this place. I just moved to this area and I will be using them as my primary Vet.< /Review>

<Text>Doc and his staff are always so kind and welcoming. It is overwhelmingly apparent that they all love what they do and it shows in the care they provide to our fur babies. I wouldn’t trust any other vet with my Oliver. Thank you Trinity Pet Hospital for always going a step above and beyond my expectations.<//Text>< Pictures>

This was my first time at Trinity Pet Hospital.  They was recommended to me by a friend.  I found their staff and their  doctors so easy to work with.  They were extremely friendly and extremely competent. Their office is inviting and extremely clean.  I found their prices fair.  This will be my pet hospital for sunny for ever.</Text>

<review>I hope the person in charge of this place reads reviews here. I called a few moments ago to make an appt. I’ve never been to this location but read great reviews online. I was so shocked how rude the woman who answered the phone was. She put me on hold for 9 mins, when she went back on the call she said my next available appt is 7/31 .... do you want to schedule it or not? I pause for a minute and thought, did she just really said that? This business is potentially loosing $ due to this employees attitude. I hope she is just having a bad morning and it’s not a daily occurrence<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dce8d8d66c0de7:0xc564599985d1f0c8< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Lucy was due for her immunization shots and annual check up.  The experience was perfect.  Dr. Kerolos was attentive and open to questions and is always very caring towards Lucy.  The staff are friendly and always helpful.  Even though we moved out of the area, we travel back to Laguna Hills for vet care at Trinity.< /text>

The Owner/Doctor understands the perils of todays "Cost of Living" in today's Orange County, and they are very "giving" in setting their costs which are driven towards the customer.  I didn't believe such a business existed anymore. Trinity has restored my hope.  By giving back to the customer, you already know that God will give back to you; and HE richly has. You've gained me as a customer.  And by the way, my Maltipoo "Buddy" is doing well after you extracted two of his teeth under anesthesia, and performed his dental cleaning.</Review>

<Text>This was our first time going here. There happened to be many emergencies this day and so we waited about an hour to be seen, but I see this as a positive thing; I would want to be seen immediately if I had an emergency . Also, there must be a reason why so many people come here. While waiting, I met and spoke w/some nice people who have going here for many years. They told me how great the vet and staff are without me asking. When I met the vet, he was wonderful and took his time even though he had so many more patients waiting and likely worked well into the night. After getting lab results, he called me personally and explained everything in detail. I recommend Trinity.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dce8d8d66c0de7:0xc564599985d1f0c8</gmapID></record>

I have been bringing my dogs and cat to Trinity for many years and I continue to be impressed with the care, concern, and professionalism of everybody in this clinic. The clinic does usually have a full waiting area, but don't get scared off. A lot of people are walk-ins that don't need to see the doctor, just get a shot for their pet. If you have an appt, unless there has been an emergency that came in, the wait time is reasonable. Dr. Kerolos has never made me feel he's in a hurry to get an exam over and is very patient, kind, and caring toward my pets. His staff is exceptional as well. They are so caring of everyones fur babies! I'm always amazed at how efficient they run the front office while keeping the appts organized.
I have and will continue to recommend Trinity Pet Hospital to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, caring and compassionate, vet clinic.< /text>< pictures>

Would not honor coupon for shots or grooming. Whoever the owner is, they should be more selective in hiring people that represent them! Can’t believe they get 4 stars, if it was up to me there would be a negative 5 star. Went to Banfield and they took care of all my puppies issues without hurting my pet. Fifi my beloved poodle had bloody paws when i picked her up, the lady in front denied they had anything to do with it. The front of the store is next to a mailbox and reeks of pet urine! I’m surprised the landlord doesn’t care.</review>< pictures>

I absolutely love this place. I've been in places where my dog caught flees, others that were just way too pricey, others where they wanted to do unnecessary procedures. Not here.

Dr. K is knowledgeable, dependable and straight to the point. The prices are reasonable. The clinic is clean. The staff is just magnificent. Vet technician Bobby is kind and gentle with the pets.

I will not be going anywhere else for the care of my fur babies.  Trinity Pet Hospital is simply the best.</text>

They have taken great care of her and we are now in the process of moving our other 2 dogs into their care. They are timely with appointment times and will graciously accommodate you as a walk in. They are equally kind to the owners and the animals. They recently helped my 13 year old cat take her last breath. I felt the staffs compassion as I had to make this difficult choice for my cat and appreciated the time they allowed me to be with her to say my good byes. It is a rarity to find a establishment that equally honors new beginnings  and difficult endings with the feeling of having family behind you guiding and supporting you.</review>< GmapID>

<review>I absolutely LOVE this vet! I have a very difficult 7lb Chihuahua who is highly aggressive with strangers.
The staff is always very helpful when I bring her in and very understanding of my problem child. Everyone there is extremely nice. The services are inexpensive yet high quality. I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else. She gets all her dental work done at Trinity and I would never take her anywhere else. They always call me the day after to check up on how she's doing and I love that. They are personable and everyone who works there truly loves animals. It definitely shows how genuine the staff are. I would highly recommend this vet to everyone who loves their pet as much as I do. I always know my dog is in good hands when I drop her off.</review>< Pictures>

Very nice staff.  Very nice and caring doctor.  Very reasonable prices.  Animal lovers want to take good care of their pets, we all cannot afford to drop $500 every vet visit.  It is refreshing to come to a vet office that understands that and still offers top notch service.  The staff is very helpful and does their best to accommodate you even if you walk in without an appointment.< /Text>

< Review>
We went for an international health certificate for our service dog to travel to Mexico, something we have gone to this Vet for before as he has been our Vet for years.  The form has to be completed accurately and completely and we were forced to come back multiple times taking an entire day for the form to be completed without mistakes ranging from simple typo's to different addresses in different places.  Once "completed", the form had to be taken to the USDA for certification for airline travel. We made the USDA appointment weeks in advance and had to spend a day getting to LAX, the only USDA office available in California.  Unfortunately, after spending an entire day and hundreds of dollars we were just turned away from USDA since the form was signed by the VET in the USDA box.  This is something we didn't check since frankly, we're not Vets.  Worse, the USDA has no appointments left before our trip so they will not see us again, even if the travel form is corrected.  This now impacts the Christmas and New Years plans of three couples, and likely the loss of thousands of dollars in airfare and the need to re-plan the Holidays.  This was an unforced error, the VET signed in the wrong box and no corrections are not allowed. This not only cost us two days ahead of the trip and multiple visits to the VET, it also ruined our holiday plans.  The USDA office told me they have never seen such an obvious error and that any VET should be competent enough to read and complete the form.  This is just unacceptable, and as a long term customer we are devastated and now find we could not trust our animal to this office that is this cavalier even after being coached through the form and made aware of the criticality of accuracy.<//Review>

Dr. Kirolos is an angel, he put his heart in everything he does for my puppy Chico, I had previously bad experiences with vets that they just want to charge without actually caring about my puppy’s health. A doctor is someone you should trust and won’t have any doubts about his diagnosis or recommendations, and that’s how we feel towards Dr. Kirolos. Definitely I recommend him to all my family, friends and coworkers, which I did already. Thank you Dr. Kirolos for your great service<//review>

On the phone, they gave us a quote of $20.00 for a vaccine, we asked multiple times if any other vaccine was needed, the answer was straight NO. They made us wait one hour then came back and slammed us $141.18 bill, and said you have, must get these today. And the answer was, well the person that gave you the quote is not a licensed nurse and should have not gave you the information. My answer was if she is not licensed or qualified to speak with the consumer, why is she on the phone in the first place?? No, you want to get the people to your place, make them wait one hour, and when they have no option they will give in to your outrageous plan.< /Review>

<text>We walked in right before closing on a Saturday and the staff and Dr. K were very kind in taking the time to look at our dog's eye, confirm it wasn't an emergency, and make an appointment for the next week to remove the small mass that just appeared the Thursday night prior but started to grow rapidly from Friday night to Saturday morning. The mass was successfully removed, and the staff made a follow up call the next day to be sure our dog was doing okay and ask if we had any questions.</text>< Pics>

Avoid this place if you can: stressful times now: no professionalism: the front office+office manager are plain rude, condescending: disrespectful to animals and owners: when your best defense is raising your voice is a sign of ignorance. VDM+vet tech are great.< /text>

Recently my little dog became ill. At the suggestion of a neighbor, i called Trinity Pet Hospital. They happily got me in the same morning, but also were so sweet to both my dog Mia and i. What i loved best is that the vet listened to me, and zeroed right in to what was going on with Mia, without unnessary tests. I am so grateful to Trinity hospital and am now a loyal client!!!!</Review>

We love Dr. K and his staff! They're in it for all the right reasons! You can see just by their actions and facial expressions that they truly care for your pets well being! We take both our dogs to trinity!
I've been to many vets in the past, considering my dogs are 12...
Trinity is by far the best! If you don't want a long wait you need to make an appointment.
Keep up the great work Trinity team!!</Review>

<review>We have been bringing my dog to Trinity since 2012.  We have never had such a bad reception.  The regular person we have seen for years has been replaced by someone named Karin who didn't even want to acknowledge anyone coming in and was too busy for anything.  She even ignored the father of one dog, Daisy, walked right by him and it wasn't until he walked out after her that she snidely remarked; Oh I was looking for a girl.  Sorry he didn't have a bull dog or a pit bull Karin.  We waited for 20 minutes just to be acknowledged.  It wasn't until I tired of being ignored, sent my wife in only to have her snap at her with "who are you here to pick up?"  We love Trinity.  Not at all happy with Karin.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The staff is very friendly. You don’t get a different Dr every time you go. That’s a huge benefit. Their prices are extremely reasonable. I sent a friend here that another vet with a very high overhead, fancy office and never see the same vet...diagnosed incorrectly and almost killed the dog. I highly recommend Trinity Pet Hospital. They are fantastic!!<//Text>

First time here. Clean, friendly, professional.

One of my Sisters is a Veterinarian, the other works in another Vet clinic. Sadly both are in Arkansas.
Trinity is the next best thing to taking my pets to family.

My cat, Felix, was howling in pain, literally. He had a horrible urinary tract infection and his kidneys mostly stopped working. The staff at Trinity were very helpful and compassionate . They took him in right away and preformed an obstruction procedure.  He is so much better now . Pretty much back to his old cantankerous self . Thank you Trinity for saving Felix's life!! 🐱<//Review>

They also let you know what the cost will be before treating your pet.  I highly recommend them.

Originally we went to Trinity to get a second opinion, when we did they did not throw in a bunch of options to drive the costs up and were much more reasonably priced. They offered the extras and explained the benefits but let me choose what was important to us, They performed a surgery on our golden retriever, he is 9 1/2 years old so he is very special to us. They called to tell me he was out of surgery and he did great. They let me know what time to pick him up. The next day they called again to check on him and see how he was doing. He was a little lethargic and I mentioned it and they told me on the phone that was normal and he would be more himself the following day. The next day he was much better, every thing they promised or told me came true, Trinity Pet Hospital delivered! I plan on using them as our pet's doctor in the future.< /Text><time>1476372574501< /time>< Resp>

He was been there for me when I had to say goodbye to 2 of my babies. He also takes wonderful care of the 3 I still have. His prices are reasonable and fair, I have been to many vets over the years and not found one to be as wonderful as Dr.K. His staff is amazing and always so helpful and kind. I have been going there almost 5 years and many appt. It has always been a positive experience for me and my pets. I highly recommend this Wonderful Vet and his Staff< /text>< pics>

Horrible. They charged 400.00 for ultrasound of my cat abdomen. Refused to give me the report, said they would not tell me who did the ultrasound, after 5 calls and promises they would email the results they told me they. did not have it, could not let me contact the office that provided ultrasound and hung up on me. I will be filing complaints against them as I told them it was odd they would not have it on file and I was beginning to think it was never completed. They blamed the ultrasound doc but refused to give his name so I could get the report if there is one. They then hung up on me.< /Text>

Extremely cheap and convenient vet that provides excellent service for half the price of my normal vet. My vet quoted us $134 for our cat to get fixed while Trinity charged us $60! They even took the time to call back the next day to check in. Will be switching to this vet from now on!<//review>

Absolutely LOVE Trinity Pet Hospital. I have been going their for 4 years and have never once had any problems. They have been honest, prices are extremely reasonable, always get reminders of when my pet is due vaccinations, always greeted with a smile and the staff works very efficiently. I highly recommend them!< /review>

In all my 35 years of caring for my pets, I have never known a more educated, honest, gentle, kind excellent Vet than Doctor K. Prices are lower than anywhere else. My dog was going to die from infection from a dog attack if he didn't get surgery that was going to be over $1000. I called everyone. I was fortunate to find doctor K who took Care Credit and charged me less than 400 total including meds. Then my lil persian 16 years old was at the end of her life and he did everything he could to help her and lovingly transition her. He does not take advantage of anyone. He is truly a gem. He is not like other vets just out for the money. He helps you weigh all the options. Its a joint decision on all care. I absolutely love Doctor K and everyone who works at Trinity! For me, there is no other vet.< /review>

Our dog needed a last-minute vaccination before going on holiday. Called around and Trinity and they said they could see him as a walk-in that day. The wait was not long, about 1/2 hr, and the staff were all very friendly, helpful, and efficient. The 'exam' (required by most vets before giving vaccines) only lasted a couple of minutes but it was free and the Dr stayed to answer a few questions, gave us some helpful health advice, and renewed a prescription saving us a trip to our regular vet. Also, the charges were very reasonable. They even provided prescription meds for about the same price I pay at Walmart. I will take my pet to them again!<//Text>

I took my little guy for a check up and shots last week. We recently moved from Colorado and I was a little nervous to go to a new pet hospital/vet but have to say, I was super impressed from the start with the way we were treated. I have another dog who will need a check up soon as well as shots and theres no question that we will be coming back to Trinity Pet Hospital. I was very impressed all around. Thank you!!!<//text>

BEST veterinary experience I've had in years, maybe ever! This reminds me of how veterinary care used to be when I grew up.....a caring doctor with wonderful bedside manner, an efficient, knowledgeable staff and prices that actually enable clients to take proper care of their pets. I couldn't have been more satisfied until I received a follow-up call to check on my dog......at that point I realized this was veterinary utopia!! I've since been back a few times and they've not disappointed!</text>

Dr. Kerolos is a wonderfully compassionate and patient doctor! He treats my babies like they were his own! His staff is also very nice and always does their very best to accommodate us. To those who may be upset about waiting times, please take into consideration that it is because they try to help pets with urgent situations even though they may not have an appointment...I know I have found myself in that category more than once. Dr K never rushes through caring for my kitties, has worked long beyond closing time to help them and I really respect that.  Who knows, maybe someday you may be in that situation yourself and will be appreciative that care could be provided to your fur baby. Thank you Dr. Kerolos and staff for all that you do!< /review>

My dog got miss diagnosed by the vet, several times. He insisted on doing the same test, without results and still medicated the same medicine that will only fix the problem for a day and then stats again. After two months, (lots of money and a visit to the emergency room) I finally got them to do a different test which it came positive but still no fix or explanation of what was causing it, why or how. So when I went to get the medication, I requested five minutes with the vet to get a more clear explanation, but it was impossible till next week!!!  I only got his attention when I requested the medical record to get a second opinion (magic words !!). When the vet finally took 5 minutes of his time to talk to me he didn't have a clue of Why/How or What was causing this problem in my dog. His answer was, "We are trying different things (trying !??!?!!?!? I don't try things when my dogs life is in danger, enough money and time I wasted already on his doing!!!) I asked questions like "could it be food allergy?", Yes he reply, well.....should you ask what Am I feeding my dog ?!?!?!?!!?" Anyway nothing of what he said made sense, he kept contradicting himself and agreeing with what ever I said. it was obvious that he didn't have a clue of what was going on.
Anyway that same day I drove a bit more to Paseo de Valencia and Alicia and took my dog to another vet, he made the right questions, he question about food, poo consistency amount, repetition.... check him and say exactly what was wrong with my dog, prescribe a medicine that fix the problem once and for good and the funny thing "it was half cost of what Trinity was charging me" the new vet himself called to do a check up on my dog the following day, and his staff on the week.
If you need regular vaccination or ears clean, maybe go and wasted your money and time at Trinity vet, if you really want to have a healthy dog and be sure they aren't do try and test on your dog....move on<//Text>

I highly recommend Trinity Pet Hospital. The caring staff and knowledgeable Dr.Kerolos has made our pet family of 3 dogs and 1 cat healthy and happy. I know in times of crisis they are there to help and have proven that many times already. I will continue to refer them to my friends and acquaintances.</review>

We originally scheduled our appointment to have our two one year Chocolate Labs neuter with our current pet hospital. But when we found out Trinity Pet Hospital would cost 1/3 less we thought we give it a try.
Boy what a great decision, the staff at Trinity are fantastic, thoughtful, informative, and just plain nice. They called us before and after visit to answer any questions and to find out our pups were doing post surgery.
I can easy say, that Trinity is our new best friend and will be our Familys new Pet Hospital.
Sincerely Greg and Imelda Cleaver.</Text>

<text>We took our cat, Mikey, to Trinity when we didn't know what was wrong with him.  The doctors saw him right away,  gave him x-rays  and saw a huge kidney and the blood tests came back stage 4 kidney failure!  He stayed there getting fluids and when he came home we kept up his treatments twice a week.  Now, his tests come back better than stage 2 and he is chasing his siblings around and enjoying his walks on leash outside to eat grass and has a great quality of life, and we have him.  We are so grateful to Trinity for the ongoing care and caring atmosphere we experience when we go there twice a week. Thank you!   I would definitely recommend Trinity to anyone who cares about their pet.< /text>< user_name>

< review>
My pets have had three years experience with Trinity Pet Hospital. When seeking a veterinarian, a close friend told me about this clinic. I found for myself that the vet and his staff have been together long enough to develop an effective work team to ensure the care of my pets. Whether in the morning or at closing time, the staff has enough energy to produce tenderness and a smile. It is with great concern for my pets when I bring them into the clinic because the wee ones count on me to take care of them. So I find out from Trinity what their condition is and how to proceed to alleviate their ailment. The feeling that I experience from Dr. Kerolos is sensitivity to me and my pets.  Some times the solution is difficult to accept, but I remember how it was told to me and the look in his eyes. I trust him. My pets are fortunate and so am I to be part of this team where caring is an art. I am Carly Cat's mom...connie< /review>

<Date>1458238801256<//Date><review>My dog would not move his leg after he was in some weeds he was in pain. My normal vet. was out of town so I went here. I had to wait in the lobby for about thirty minutes but that's understandable since I had no appointment. It turned out only to be a bee sting it took the vet about 30 seconds to diagnose and remove the stinger. I am thinking about making this place my permanent vet for my dog. Obviously I recommend this place they treat you well.😎
Thanks again for taking care of Carl on sort notice.

My six year old Boxer dog is in good health condition because of Trinity Pet Hospital. The Dr. is experienced and detailed and the staff is too. The cost for care is reasonably competitive.  Trinity Pet Hospital is the first place I take my dog for care.<//Review>

<Text>I love Trinity Pet Hospital!  You walk in, and you are greeted with a smile,  everyone is friendly, they move quick to get you into a room. I took my dog in on a very busy day, with no appointment, and I was in a room in about 20 minutes...  I did not think that was bad at all!

Thankyou Trinity Pet Hospital!</Text>< Name>

I have 12 years old Maltese, and he is my life, love and my baby. Always I want the best of everything for him and I am so glad I choose Trinity Pet Hospital 4 Years ago, when I was deep down with his heart murmur and Dry eyes symptoms. Dr. Kerolos is a wonderful doctor, He is Very knowledgeable, with excellent diagnosis, patient and caring while walking us through this very painful process. Thank you so much for saving Fingi’s health! He is doing better every day thanks to you and your staff.
The nicest Staff, extremely kind, Caring, taking excellent and compassionate care, very friendly ,AWESOME service.
Highly recommend this vet for your sick & injured pets or simply for preventative maintenance and GREAT prices.
God Bless You All,< /text>

I can't say enough about the staff.  They were all so nice and understanding, and very helpful.  The doctor was gentle, kind, knowledgeable, and my dog took to him right away.  He took his time with her, and at the same time, got my baby in for an Xray & urine sample, and out with meds expeditiously.  AND, the prices for everything were VERY fair.  I look forward to going back when needed.  Thank you Trinity Hospital.<//Text>

The staff is incredibly caring. Cesar was the first one to cut Buddy's nails. Buddy was always so scared he would have to be sedated which made me very worried about his future health. Now I know they can be trimmed without sedation. They also took care of Buddy's cherry eye, now he is not irritated and rubbing his eye. Buddy will be going in for teeth cleaning next.  They keep up with records and what is next to keep your fur baby healthy. Always make Trinity Hospital your first choice.</review>

I have been taking my furbabies here since there were babies.  Dr K and the staff are great!  They make you feel like you are part of the family and treat your babies as if they were their own.  My babies have had several emergencies and they take them in right away - from bee stings on the tongue to ruptured anal glands to vaccinations/regular checkups.  This place is the best!  Thank you for taking such good care of my babies!  <3<//Review>

Trinity Pet Hospital was recommended to me as a summer visitor
to Laguna Woods CA by another dog owner.  Dr. K took care of my
American Eskimo, Ripley, 3 times over the summer.  I was very pleased
by the care that Ripley received. I plan to return and continue
to use Dr. K for many years to come.

My Son got bit by dog on his face. and his life was in danger and they didn't care at least to replay back to my email and give us a peace of mind that Dog had all the shots or not. The didn't have to release all the records. They could only let us know that there is nothing to worry about. 😕😞😕

<review>Dr. Corolis is a great vet that has taken care of our dogs for years.  One of our dogs couldn’t walk and he diagnosed and prescribed meds that within a week had him up and pulling me like he was a pup
Also, the staff is wonderful, always helpful and caring.< /review><rating>5<//rating><Gmap_id>0x80dce8d8d66c0de7:0xc564599985d1f0c8</Gmap_id>< username>

I would recommend Trinity Pet Hospital to anyone.

Truly one of the best pet hospitals I've ever used. Careful, friendly staff, doctors willing to work with you to create a plan for your pet, avoiding expensive tests unless experience shows they are needed, comping some charges and treating pets like their own.

I only wish they had a day care or overnight boarding<//Text>

<rating>3</rating><text>My dog has thyroid cancer and wanted a refill of Gabapentin.  I was referred to another facility by Trinity when my dog was potentially  diagnosed with cancer.  The referred facility that did all kinds of testing & blood work costing $1000 and came to conclusion that there is not much to do but to only give him comfort.  When I tried getting a refil with trinity the  wanted to do another blood test for $140 and will not give to me until he gets blood work. I told them that we didn't have to and all I am requesting is a refill to minimize pain. After explaining and getting approved with vet I was able to get the refill but, they told me he needs his blood work done $140.00 NEXT refill. I now that no blood work is needed. I am little disappointed having to ask multiple times for pain med for my dog and having this same challenge again.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I really like this office and highly recommend them. I have six rescue dogs and I am on a fixed income. I went to another veterinarian previously and they charged me an arm and a leg for services. Trinity was reasonable and made it possible for me to keep all six and not have to rehome them when I'm facing a financial hardship. I moved 500 miles away now and I miss them terribly, the office staff and Dr. K.<//Review>

<Name>BJ L< /Name><Text>This is the best veterinarian hospital by far.  Dr. Kerolos is very caring with our cat and is very knowledgable about the issues she has.  Every time we go, he is very gentle with her and takes the time to comfort her and make sure that we understand everything that is going on.  I trust him completely.  Catherine is always a pleasure to see at the front desk.  She is courteous and patient and always has a smile when you walk in the door.  Their prices are reasonable and they have "cat plans" for visits and vaccines throughout the year.  I wouldn't choose any other doctor for my cat.< /Text><time>1458268505493<//time>< Resp>

<review>DONT BRING YOUR CAT HERE!!!! been here about 3 times and am not happy! This place and the staff only care about dogs. The waiting room is cramped and every time ive been there ive been the only one with a cat and the other owners dogs bark extremely loud which scares my senior cat and none of the workers tell them to be quiet!!! Seriously like 7 dogs in a tiny waiting room! No control! They treat every dog that comes in like family but every time I've brought in my precious little kitty baby, they could care less .The attitude toward my cat isn't nice .The nurses and receptionists show more enthusiasm to a dog that comes in for their nails getting clipped over my cat coming in for his blood work/check up because he has kidney failure and gum disease. I went in the other day and paid for a urine analysis and blood work and some meds (costs over 200$) and I went home for them to call me and say they forgot to get my cats urine .How lovely. Also after that visit, my cat came home with bandages on both his legs covered in blood .Not only that but he smelled like alcohol all over his head and neck .They said they took his blood pressure and some blood so I dont know what the 2 blood soaked bandages on BOTH his legs were for and the wetness of alcohol on his head. My boy was NOT a happy kitty after he came home. Will call in the morning to tell them how I feel about their treatment of the most important thing in my life.<//review><date>1552128611328</date><username>Marissa Maulorico< /username><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce8d8d66c0de7:0xc564599985d1f0c8<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Zero stars isn't an option but that's what this place deserves.
Dr. Kerolos and his office never called us back after taking blood work- wouldn't have mattered, hours after going to Trinity, we had to rush our dog to the hospital at midnight, they immediately put him on antibiotics and saved him but if we had just waited around for Trinity Pet Hospital to help us, our dog would have been in pain with an infection and possibly dead by now from the high fever he was running. Went to the vet on Tuesday, rushed him to ER at midnight...I had to call Trinity on Friday just to see if they had any excuse for never contacting us!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I love trinity pet hospital. They've always been very caring with my little dogs. When little Annie got really sick they were so good about explaining what was wrong with her and taking extra time to care for her. I got the same care when I brought Koko in when she could not move without crying. I was terrified.. Had not idea what was wrong with her. Again the staff at trinity helped me through it until little Koko was running around like her old self.
The staff is so helpful and loving.. A plus they don't charge you an arm and a leg! Couldn't ask for more!< /Text>

We love Trinity pet hospital Dr. Kerolos and the staff really care and dr. K usually knows what the problem is at first examination he doesn't run a bunch of unneeded tests sometimes you have to wait if you don't have an appointment but it's worth it because you'll go home with your pet taken care of we moved out to the desert and still drive 2 hours one way to take our pets to Trinity Pet Hospital</text>

Dr. Kerolos  saved my dog's life, without his help we  would've lost her . The staff is professional and the place is welcoming. This review is especially for Kerolos,  I don't believe I have met a person who has the kind of passion for helping animals like him.   This Vet is unlike any other, he loves animals, he loves his job, and my dog,  Surprise is alive and well because of Dr. Kerolos and  his caring  staff.   Most vets  treat animals like another number and  with little to no care, but not this one!  The heart warming presence Dr. Kerolos has will impact you forever.  I've been going Trinity for 5 years... If your loved one is in need of a vet for anything then go to Dr. Kerolos.<//text>

THE FRONT DESK LADY SAID, " HAHA I DONT CARE IF YOU LEAVE A
REVIEW IT WONT AFFECT US AT ALL AND GOOD LUCK".

I don even know where to start, have a dog named princess she is only 7 years old, this place was trying to tell me she was 14!!!! they cant even tell the difference between a 7 year old dog and a 14 year old dog!!! Dr. kEROLOS?? even said, " she has good eyes and legs for a 14 year old...what a joke!!!
the stuff are the rudest people I HAVE ever met in my life. sent my grandma in they charged us $300 for a "test" because princess has a bump on her arm. after waiting 10 days and not hearing anything back and princess still crying in pain every night. i sent my grandma back in to figure out what is going on....they charged my grandma another $55! to tell her they cant do anything and they can promise the problem would be fixed. the first estimate they sent my grandma home with was $500...after the 2nd visit to get the test results witch they should have called the estimate came back at $800 and they charged my grandma $55 for a "recheck" they didn't even do anything!!!! when i asked Karen or Mario who ever works the front they said...anything you come here we have to charge you money...she said she didn't care if i left reviews and didn't care my grandma spent $400 ($100 of it was check in?) and we never got test results and princess still needs to go to the er.
Karen is the rudest person I HAVE ever met..
dr.kerolos is a scam artists that is after old people!!!!
this place just wants to make money off peoples hurt animals!! go look at all the reviews.....i will never stop posting reviews....no one else grandma or dog deserves to be treated the want my grandma and princess did.....the staff is in rude and doesn't care about your pets they want your cash!!!! please be careful with your pets and pray for princess...i really pray what happens to me doesn't happen to you and your loving animals....
again the DR.KEROLOS COULDN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A 7 YEAR OLD DOG AND A 14 YEAR OLD DOG.....HE BLAMED THEY GIRL AT THE FRONT DESK THAT YELLED AT MY GRANDMA OVER THE PHONE SAYING SHE HAD 2 WRONG NUMBERS AND COULDN'T GET A HOLD OF US....THEY NEVER CALLED, AFTER THEY GOT PAID, THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT PRINCESS OR HER HEALTH....SAVE YOUR PET!!!</review>< pictures>

I have been with Trinity Hospital for almost 2 years now taking care of my two dogs. I started with them merely because they were around the corner from me. Throughout the time, there have been a few incidents of very disappointing experience:
1. There was once a replacement doctor, who was nothing but a JOKE! The visit session went as if he is there to play with the pets and just try to entertain the pet owner and the pet. Answer to any diagnosis question was "maybe yes, maybe no; everything is possible"... I asked not to be seen by that Dr. ever again and gladly I never was, but I still had to pay for a "visit"!

2. On memorial weekend 2017, I used their boarding services. My only dog at the time was on some medication that was prescribed by Dr. K, himself. I put all the daily medications, labeled nice & neat for AM/PM use. Left a note in the bag for medication, and obviously mentioned to the front desk as well. I picked up my pet after a few days, and when returned home, I found the entire medications (as well as treats, etc.) intact in the bag! Obviously, nobody even touched that bag! I called them specifically about the medications and they pretend that they gave the medication out of their inventor; yea sure!! They preferred not to use the readily available medication that was paid for, and they supplied it on their own cost; yea sure!! They didn't even apologize and acted as if they did their job very much right!

3. On February of 2018, I had one my dogs, who got skin rash and allergy, for a visit, and they gave me a bunch of medications to take home, as if everything all good. It was only me doing the math after a few days, to realize that there is not even enough pills for one of the medications to complete the "treatment period." I called them and they mentioned that yes we were running out of it at the moment. First of all, "running out of medication" is not an excuse to leave treatment period incomplete. Secondly, if that was the case, they should've at least gave me a heads up for the lack of supply, and either offer to supply me later; or at the worse case, I know I have to go supply it from somewhere. Sending a patient home with not enough medicine is very unprofessional and medically wrong.

4. My only reason to go back there after all was ONLY a type of good impression that I had with the main Dr. there (Dr. K), however, a recent disappointing experience took that only remaining motivation away and I am not going back there. My dogs mated in late March/early April, and I had taken them last week for regular vaccination, where they said my female cannot get vaccines while pregnant. Then Dr. K advised on having an X-ray for ONLY reason of being able to count the puppies so after delivery, we could make sure there is nothing stuck in the belly. To my unwillingness of the necessity of doing so (because she was doing great in all aspects), I took that ONLY reason as valid and agreed to the X-ray. The outcome was that Dr. K could only see 6 puppies and his assessment was that she is not due until at least another 3 weeks or so which was strange to me, but I took the word from the expert. To my surprise and my unreadiness, I got caught totally off-guard on Monday, 5/28, to her giving birth to 12 puppies! So not only that X-ray was unuseful (most probably because it was taken not correctly), but it even worked to my disadvantage by not having me properly prepared for the delivery.

5. I called them on Monday morning feeling that my dog could go thru anything during or right after delivery, but their office was completely closed. Then I called them on Tuesday 7 AM describing the (almost emergency) situation and asked to talk to Dr. K. I had a miss call from him on 7:20 PM!! and I ended up talking to him on Wednesday. Even after all the wrong diagnosis and everything else around this unnecessary, unuseful X-Ray and the harms, they even didn't consider a customer courtesy on the service.

and other issues such as rude and unfriendly staff, lack of space for pets and pet owners, etc. are even too minor to mention.<//Review>

< review>
The best vet in all of California hands down. I’ve been going to them for approximately 10 years. Taking my two yorkies and my 4 cats there for different reasons. When you take your animal there you know you are getting quality medical care at a affordable price. They are never pushy and always want you to make the best decision for you and your babies.

Recently I tragically lost my beloved Yorkie Henna. Unfortunately she had a medical emergency in the middle of the night and was unable to see Dr. Kerolos at Trinity Pet hospital. I’ve still been grieving and have had no time to tell Trinity that she had passed away. To my surprise today when I checked my mail I received a beautiful card from Trinity Pet Hospital sending me their heartfelt condolences. I cannot express enough how much this simple little card meant to me. In a time of grief it brightened my day. It’s all because at Trinity Pet hospital Dr. Kerolos and his staff truly care about you and your animal. Their compassionate care is second to none. I would recommend them to any family and friends who want a reliable doctor that truly cares.

Thank you for your love and support during this difficult time. It means the world to us.

I have been taking my 7 year old poodle bichon mix to Trinity for a couple of years now and they are great.  Well worth the drive, since I live in Irvine and they are in Laguna Hills - it is a drive for me, believe it or not - we have many options for vets here in Irvine, but I still make the drive to Trinity!  They were suggested by the volunteer rep who we adopted him from at Pet Match Rescue. I was in search of a trustworthy vet office who would be sensitive to my dog's needs since he is skiddish and nervous with other people. The volunteer rep also said that Trinity had some of the most affordable pricing in almost all of OC. She was right on both. For ever exam and issue since we started going here, I have had only great, gentle and trustworthy experiences with Trinity. Thank you!</Text>

TERRIBLE! From the waiting room to reception to tech to vet. They were all horrible! Avoid at all costs. Rude, inconsiderate and a total cluster. The vet didn’t even look in my dogs eyes or ears!?!< /Review>
