Rude, dismissive and disgusting person serviced our family today. She identified herself as the owner after being extremely rude to my 12 year old daughter and making her cry and feel unwanted. We entered the store together and when I went outside to make a phone call, the owner spoke down to my daughter suggesting she should leave and didn’t know what she was doing in her store. We visit stores like this all the time, our family believes in spirituality and this store sure does not care about kindness or spirituality. I can recommend a nearby store with great energy and service with caring people who are kind: Thunderbolt Spiritual Bookstore nearby.<//text>

This place is just special. Everything they carry is beautiful, genuine and has  symbolism. Just walking in you get a sense of tranquility and grounding.  Whether you shop or just visit, you can relish in the great energy. And it's always a lucky moment to have a good conversation with Reena.< /Review>

My favorite store in the world!
I absolutely LOOOOVE this store!  I love the clothing, the jewelry, accessories, the home decorations, candles, crystals, music, incense, I am not kidding - such a HUGE selection of awesome items - Absolutely everything in here I adore!  The vibe in here is incredible - so soothing and fun at the same time.  Reena, the owner is one of the kindest souls on earth.  She will help you find the perfect outfit or anything you are looking for.  I have bought gifts for my friends and family and they always love whatever I buy from here.  Reena cooks up delicious food and hosts an event here twice a year with live music all day long.  Reena even helped me dress up in a sari - she taught me how to do it and now I can wear saris whenever I feel like dressing up.  If you're looking for unique, eclectic, vibrant, special items - this is the place to go!  I give this place 100 stars over and over again. Highly recommend< /Text>

< Review>
Kathmandu Boutique is a place of serenity and character. Reena is one of the most caring and helpful individuals one can meet. I have been there a Handful of times and am greeted personally with the utmost welcome and care. I live 26 miles away from Kathmandu Boutique and would visit everyday if I could. The unique
Inventory stands on its own from handmade art to  hand woven materials to create the tools needed to help achieve ones balance and serenity within to ultimately find enlightenment within oneself. Theres so much to see yet also there is also to do. Reena was kind enough to offer the room she rents out for meditation or classes for whom is seeking ....
A better self, higher state of being within mind body and soul. I am just in complete awe that she is as humble as one can be. Also I believe if there was enough  of us like Reena we would be able to change the energy
We are facing today for the better.... meaning within the general public. So please for your sake and others..... Enlighten yourself., go to Kathmandu Boutique take a loved one take a friend it is the way to continue your journey
And the way to start your new journey
In finding the tools needed to help you find balance and help you through your path to enlightenment.

Namaste ☯️ 🙏🏼<//Review>

This colorful boutique captures the imagination. A beautiful oasis in the midst of a busy thoroughfare. For spiritual seekers and the curious, there are Nepalese and Indian clothing; jewelry; accessories; crystals. But the real jewel is the owner, Reena. A bright personality who welcomed us and gave us a good deal.<//review>

An amazing experience! Beautiful + unique products, helpful service, and a lovely and peaceful atmosphere inside! Most spiritual boutiques in LA have the same products with jacked-up prices, but everything here is so beautifully made, extensive in variety, and reasonably priced. Will be back there soon with an entourage!<//Text>

I Love Kathmandu Boutique! I have an amazing experience ever time I walk into this shop, it is one of the most unique stores I have ever been in.  Reena (shop owner) and her Sister Beena will make you feel at home with their awesome hospitality and will even offer you some chai tea :)
I highly recommend Kathmandu Boutique for personal items and gift shopping!</review>

Dont pass this spot up! Best yoga, yogi, hippie, confortable clothing and spiritual shop around. Any time im in the area I stop by just to see whats new. Ive been to lots of shops in socal and have yet to find another shop like it. Even if you dont buy anything, just stepping into the store to feel the energy is worth it. The lady that runs it is so sweet and kind. This place is just a blessing!

<Text>This a good gas station/convenience store because they have free coffe(you get with any fuel purchase), hot fries chicken, Thrifty's ice cream, and they sell beer, and it's 24 hours, but it's very hot on the inside (i feel so bad for the employees), and there is not restroom restroom, and there is no hand sanitizer near the gas pumps. Everybody who leaves here is sweating and has dirty hands. I’m leas snake attecion to COVID more hand sanitizer please< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbwvif7fLofqG_6ViJx6zKB8JO7QgoQyg29xIi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Didn't like the fact that they dont accept credit cards nor sell or cash lotto tickets. And worse that they don't have any signs saying that. That would help instead of wasting time at the pump trying to insert card.</review>

<Review>Best gas station, cashiers are always friendly and they keep the station really clean, the food has so many options so if youre on the road and get hungry youll find something for you. The only issue is the air/water isnt that powerful so you will have to wait a bit to fill up your tires.</Review></record>

It’s not a bad dentistry they do a good job it’s the wait time. You’ll see. It’s only one doctor I believe for all the the kiddos that show up. So he has a lot on his plate to handle. If you have the patience head on over!</text>

The staff is SOOO FRIENDLY!! They have lots of cute amenities that just make the kiddos enjoy the dental appointment. My kid had 2 cavities and the DR brought out a book an explain how Cavities are made and how they will be removed. It really put my little one at ease. We went home very happy and worry free we will definitely be making this office out new family dentistry (for the kids)< /Review>

<review>I have five children ranging from the age of 5 to 19 and I take them all to Palmdale children’s dental. Best dental office my children have ever been too. The dental team as a whole are amazing friendly and very professional. The office is very clean and Follow all the COVID-19 regulations. This staff goes above and beyond to make your children and yourself comfortable and safe in their environment. All of my children have had work done and never walk out of this office with pain. Highly recommend this dental office fabulous place.</review>< pictures>

So I've been hearing the ads for this place on Pandora radio decided to give it a try. Wow amazing!!! One of the best choices I've done for my kid... So happy I decided to give this place a try, I'm truly impressed with their service so detailed with her cleaning, and all the services rendered. Just amazing! Blessed to have found this dentist🙏< /text>

<Review>Dr. Sadek is the best ever, the patience and concern he has for my 11yr old and 7yr old is pure and divine. I thank him so much for showing them that the dentist doesn't has to be scary experience. He is wonderful and so is his staff, I can't thank them enough🤗🥰!
I recommend him to anyone, if you don't live in the AV he's worth the drive< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Great place! Friendly staff. Given that it was my son’s first time seeing a dentist and that he is autistic, the Dentist worked really well with him and gained his trust fast! Hands down the best.< /Review>

<Name>Angela Jackson<//Name><Time>1583527579629<//Time><rate>5</rate><Review>I brought my son in on 3/5/20 after being referred to Palmdale Children’s Dental by another dentist office who didn’t treat children. Right away the ladies at the front desk were welcoming and got to me right away. I was given my paperwork and had only sat down for a second before they were calling my son back. Talk about quick service! The ladies who took the x-rays were very patient and gentle with my son because he was a little nervous. Once they were finished we did have to wait a little while to see the dentist, but the ladies at the front were very apologetic because he hadn’t arrive yet and thanked me for my patience. Once we saw the dentist we were told we would have to come back for treatment, but luckily they caught us before we left and asked if we wanted to get the work on his teeth taken care of today. Of course! They don’t use shots, but instead use laughing gas. I had a lot of questions and each one was answer patiently and throughly without anyone getting annoyed with all of them. My son had no pain afterwards and was all smiles. They even gave his a couple quarters to get toys from their vending machine, a stuffed animal and a ballon!  I’ve found his new dentist office and I couldn’t be happier with them.</Review>< pictures>

I took my 4yr daughter to this office today it was her first time going to the dentist. She was extremely nervous and scared. Everyone in the office were beyond amazing! Just the whole environment they have for kids there is so great! She felt comfortable and safe. I’ll be taking my other 2 kids for sure here. I even wanna be treated here! Thank you so much for the amazing work everyone does here! Definitely referring all my family and friends.< /review>

This is literally the best dentist for kids! The dentist is so kind and understanding with the children and rewards them as well. He will be the only dentist aloud to check my daughters teeth and if I ever have anymore kids they will be brought here too.</review>

Always loved this place until they kept postponing my youngest sons appointments because he was scared! Then was told to go to Bakersfield so they could put him to sleep to do the work! After that they said the same thing about my 6 year old! So I decided after 7 loyal years with this dentist it was time to find a new dental office, within a week both of my boys were seen and got all the work done without being put to sleep! I will admit the staff here is very nice and professional, but they will only deal with kids who don’t get scared or complain when it hurts< /text><time>1560574778553</time><userid>110539940907794161303< /userid><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

<Review>ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!!!!! this place they are one of the most kind, paciest, loveling  children dental office in the whole AV. As soon as you go in it is a fun place to go into for kids with lots of toys and movie for them, every time they leave that office you bet your kid will come out always with a price in there hand, there have even been times were a staff member will come out with a whole bunch of balloons for the kids and even sometimes make noise for them it truly is the BEST Dentist office you could ever take your child. Both the Staff Members and the Dr. are the absolute best of the best. There are no words to explain how happy and such of a great patient/customer experience  they try to give you every time you go in for a check up or even a treatment. THANK YOU!!!! so much to the Dr. and Staff Members for making my daughters experience so great when ever we come and always making her super comfortable.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I have two children 7 and 2. My 7 year old has come in a few times for work even an extraction and throughout the process they were so patient and caring, so much that they have an employee hold the children’s hands for comfort and reassurance. My two year old (who is quite a handful), he had his teeth cleaned and they were so clever in the way they had him “assist” in cleaning his teeth. He did so well and of course thanks to the staff.</Review>

<review>thank you for a great experience, my daughter sat down for the first time and allowed her teeth to be cleaned without any screaming.
The staff and doctor definitely knows how to work with children and that is the reason he is booked 4 months in advanced.
It’s been a long journey to find a great dentist.</review><Rate>5< /Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Here is the deal. This doctor is amazing. He works with the kids, making them feel comfortable is his main priority. As an over protective mother this is something I can truly appreciate. When I was told my toddler was going to have to be sedated and restrained I was very up set. He makes my Elena feel comfortable and safe. Which is my number one concern. He's very  patient and understanding. (Especially with me... Again over protective mother)  I live out of town but have no problem with the drive. It's well worth it! The staff omg the staff they are the kindest group of people. Overall a great place to take your little one.< /text>

My daughter is only 2 and she can be very dramatic and a handful! She had her 1st dentist appointment today and we are sure it will not be her last one here! They are very resourceful and made the experience as pleasant as it could be.< /Text>

Our daughter's were referred here by my regular dentist. At first I was sceptical but then I seen how nice the staff treated my two daughter's. Dr was the best!! While working on their teeth he sang and talked to them while they watched a movie that they got to pick. I defiantly loved it! They came out of there so happy! Thank you you're the best!!! I defiantly will be coming here from now on!!</Review>

<text>We had been to at least 3 disappointing children’s dental offices before we found Palmdale Children’s Dental. Now I can’t imagine taking them anywhere else. The staff and Dr Sadek are amazing. They actually care about your child and it really shows. Best in the AV if you ask me💕</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Review>4 of my children have been seen by PALMDALE Childrens.  I cannot express enough how well this office treats children. The dentist takes the time no matter how young to talk to each one of them.  He’s like a big kid. Lol. Non of my grandkids or great grandaughter have left there afraid or in tears.  That’s a plus in this family.  Waited for 3 years for Childrens HospitL dentistry to get one in because of her fear.
Thank you all so much from the girls at the front seat to the ones that keep it clean.<//Review><time>1573078007134</time><user_name>Robin Curry< /user_name><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

My son had a very horrible experience with another dentist a few months ago. Very traumatizing for both of us. I heard good things about this dentist took a chance on him and trusted him with my son and it was the best experience he could've had. He takes his time with them and reads to them and gains there trust. And the staff he has are awesome. Today was our 2nd visit and not one cry thank you soo much!! 😁❤< /review>

I love Dr. Yasser and his team. My son has autism, and they always make sure he is 100% comfortable before doing anything. Today was the first time he let them actually clean his teeth, which is HUGE! They are all so patient, while at the same time treating the kids like real people with real feelings. He had quite a traumatic dental experience before coming to Dr. Yasser, so it has taken a while for him to even be okay getting in the chair. They read him a story to help him understand what they were going to do. They let him explore and ask questions. And my daughter loves going, too! She even says how amazing her teeth feel after. The relationship with these kids is so important, and they make sure our kids feel that.< /text>

Just want to say that I highly recommend this dental office. My daughter was traumatized at the previous dentist had terrible experience. Ever since I brought here to Palmdal children dental it has been amazing, Dr took his time and made sure she was comfortable before even taking her to a room to b seen. She was about 2 years old and in 2 days she will now be 10. She loves it and even ask me all the time when is my dentist appointment she looks forward to coming every time. I have recommended several ppl and they all love it.</Review>

< Review>
I’m not sure why my review keeps getting removed. My fiancé took my daughter here for her first check up ever and he did the ORAL EXAM in the waiting room where there is no sink and gloves in pocket. Then gave the diagnoses there while others were in the waiting room close enough to hear everything. I thought that was inappropriate when he told me what happen so I called them to get corporates number and he said “no I’m not giving you anything I dare you to come get it” which was completely unprofessional, so I did. And cops were called and a big scene erupted because he refused to give me any information to report him. The cop said the only think I can do is go after his pockets. I’ve been sharing my story and have pictures of him sitting on the floor before taking patients. Other family’s shared stories of there horror with me as well such as him asking the girls to sit on his lap and doing exams in the lobby. One lady told me the girl with a boy hair cut used the same tool from her sons mouth in another child’s mouth before sterilization. They threatened a friend of mine pretending to be a lawyer telling her to remove her review. She never did. DO NOT GO HERE.</Review>

This office is amazing!!! I was recently referred to Dr. Sadeks office for dental work on my 6 year old daughter. We both had major anxiety due to the work that would be performed which required a baby root canal. During the doctors initial exam we found him to be thorough in his explanation of the treatment process and learned some valuable tips on keeping my daughters teeth free of cavities in the future. On the day of the treatment the doctor and his assistants were great with my daughter. The doctor worked quickly and made her feel at ease. The doctors assistants also helped so much in making her feel calm and comfortable. My daughter said she didn’t feel a thing and was excited to see Dr. Sadek again in the future.  I have to also say the front desk, which is so important, especially Shannon was a great help to us during the booking process. Shannon was so pleasant and wonderful. Not only that, she re assured me everything would be okay. Thank you so much Shannon, Dr. Sadek and the wonderful staff who helped during my daughters treatment. I highly recommend to anyone in search of a wonderful dentist with a great staff for their child to come and visit this amazing office !!< /Review>

<Review>The dentist is rude condescending, and full of himself. His work is poor quality. Just saying the truth. Had to go to a different dentist to fix everything he did, because he says there’s nothing wrong with it. Either way waste of time, money and resources.<//Review>< username>

<text>My daughters loved their experience at Palmdale Children's Dental! The staff and Dr. Sadek are great with the children, especially Shannon, one of the dental assistants.  My oldest daughter was scared of going in for a check up but with Shannon's caring and compassionate way she eased her nerves.  I'm glad I was recommended to this office.</text>< userid>

Palmdale children dentist is the best dentist office for kids I have found. My girls had cavities and the doctor filled them and u couldn't even tell they had them filled. My girls fell in love with one of the nurse her name is Shannon  fockler she is great with kids and a awesome nurse. She knows how to claim the kids. I am glad I found this dentist office.<//Text>

This office is not what it claims to be on their website! The Dr is not as friendly as they say he is. He did not gain my daughters trust, he was mean, aggressive, and rude. I seen him treat his staff horrible. At one point I seen him shove a tray at his assistant. He did not treat my 4 yr old nice and after waiting 4 hrs to be seen when my appt was at 10 am they took me back at 2pm I expected the Dr to be kind. Instead he was in a bad mood and it reflect on his work. My daughter was traumatized after this experience. It was her 3 appt at this office and although her other 2 experiences were lovely thanks to the assistants, we will never go back.< /Review>

They are amazing at this office.  Friendly staff and the dentist is so nice.  My 3 year old has to be bribed to leave the office.  My son had to have a root canal and the doctor did great with my son.  He made my son want to brush his teeth and keep them clean.  I really cant say enough good about this office.</review>

Thanks, Dr. Sadek! My daughter is afraid of doctors in general, but not of you. You kept her happy during the whole visit. I’m still amazed that you do dentistry wirhout shots and only nitrous. You definitely have a way with children.<//Review>

We have found our forever dentist. The staff is amazing I saw a kid crying at the lobby and the lobbyist was nice to go and comfort the toddler with a ballon. I have to say the kids leave happy looking forward to go back with the kids. 👍🏼</Review>

< review>
I had sort of a gut feeling that this dentist wasn’t very honest. But nevertheless he seemed nice so I stayed there. The last checkup I took my kids to which was about 6 months ago he said my son had a cavity. I didn’t get it filled then. Fast forward to about a month ago. I had an appointment scheduled at 4pm. They called and asked if I could be there at 3, I told her over the phone no earliest at 330. So she says ok. I show up at 330 and they tell me my appointment was at 3. I told them no she told me 330. But they refused and wanted to reschedule me. I got upset because I think it is unprofessional to tell someone a time and change it. So I decided to take my kids to another dentist. Sure enough, the other dentist says my son DIDNT HAVE ANY CAVITIES! I am glad I changed before he started drilling on their adult teeth! He already drilled one “cavity” he supposedly had. Who knows if it was even there. Anyways I’m glad we switched because this guy seems fake and dishonest.< /review>

<text>We were scheduled for a 12:00pm appointment, we showed up at 11:50am to fill out paperwork as my daughter was going to be a new patient. We waited, and waited, and waited, and still had not been called back for her cleaning by 12:45pm. Naturally I started asking what the delay is and how much longer. They kept telling me the are just waiting for a room to open up and the next excuse and then the next excuse. Finally by 1pm I had to cancel the appointment and we left, never got a chance to even see the dentist. If they can't respect our time or maintain a schedule, I can't expect them maintain my daughter dental health.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c25831b3495441:0x3565ee9294c07ad5<//gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<review>Ashley was great! Dr. Yasser was very rude! As a dentist he did not introduce himself to me. While I was trying to smile at my 7 yr old to make sure he knows that everything is okay(since he was crying), the dentist quickly said mom I need to talk to you(in a rude way) while walking out of the room. After that instead of talking to me in private he was waiting in the lobby for me to meet him. He then started by saying I do not need to have any communication with my son, and smiling is a form of communication, so I can not do that. His attitude was horrible. I explained how  since this is the first time my son has been at this office as a parent I am concerned that he does not feel comfortable and would like to make him feel comfortable. He stated that that is not my job, my job is to just sit there and not say or do anything. Obviously, he must not have any children. I wasn't speaking, just smiling, but I can't even do that. The conversation went on, but didn't really get anywhere. He continued to talk over me and by then, I had enough. I am pretty sure if my husband was there, he wouldn't have spoken to me the way he did. This is the first and last time I will take my child here. He is very controlling and condescending! Never going back here, and I will be reporting him to the American Dental Association!</review><GmapID>0x80c25831b3495441:0x3565ee9294c07ad5<//GmapID><Response>None<//Response><time>1484342694543<//time>< Pics>

<text>I was super nervous to go here based off of some of the negative reveiws but was like screw it. My baby needs her tooth fixed and they got the nitrous gas. So anyways.

Staff is friendly and so is the doctor. But listen folks he is dead serious about keeping your mouth shut and letting them do their work. For me no biggie at all.

So anyways my daughter Chloe is 3 and is terrified of doctors so in her mind the dentist is still the doctor. We went to a dentist office who couldnt even get her to show them her mouth as she was frantic and screaming so they recommended I go here.

There is a corner filled with toys for the kids which was great because Chloe kept busy between that and her tablet instead of focusing on not wanting to be there.  Chloes issue is with men which is another difference from the other office we went to. This office is filled with woman minus the doctor or dentist whatever he is called lol. So chloe was comfy from the start between dealing with woman and having the toys. We got called back within 30mins of being their. Mind you I was added to their day and not a part of the original plan for the day, so that was pretty awesome. They took xrays which my daughter was great for.before even starting xrays they let the child pick out which movie they would like to watch on netflix. Each room has a big flat screen tv in front of the chairs for the kids to watch. I beleive she didnt fuss this due to the immediate experiance she got from first arriving. Having toys! Thats a must for children. And then being able to watch TV.

So anyways as some of the reveiws have said the guy definately dresses down which is amazing because chloe stared at him like who are you but didnt have the fear of god in her that a doctor was standing in front of her. A+ for that. He talked to her to get her comfy right there by the toys and than peeked at her teeth which she actually allowed him to do. Then discussed xrays with me. He explains I can be on the room but no parenting to please let him do the work.

Ok so here comes the most nervous part for me!! We are now waiting for her to get called back to get a tooth extracted....

Totally fine! They tell her to smell the air in that nose thing they put on her and then let the nitrous do its magic. Doc comes in numbs her with a needle and she doesn't even flinch. He pulls the tooth and boom we are done. 2 hours start to finish.
Best part of it all is when i took Chloe into the mirror to show her she yelled "thats awesome!!" (A few of her cousins are 6 and 7 and lost many teeth so she is stoked to be like them)

10 stars all the way. This office definitely knows how to make and keep the children calm and comfortable. No worries . take your children here. You just have to be willing to let go of being a parent just for a moment and allow this guy to work his magic. Theres no way in hell this wouldve ever worked at a basic dental office :)<//text>< Pics>

Terrible. Patient privacy is number 1 in any medical field INCLUDING a dentistry also making a patient feel welcomed and comfortable with thier stay and leave is number 1, and this place has been by far worse. Who checks a Patient in the lobby which first off is super unsanitary and note hands out their information like their in a classroom, AGAIN a big violation. You're handing out information of a patient that shouldnt be handed. Its supposed to be private. The dentist should have his licenses removed almost immediately. This place is a joke.

Your privacy is for sure not private here.<//review>

First I would like to thank the people that takes the time to write reviews.
Thanks to the bad reviews here, I was able to be civil when my turn came to talk to the Doctor.

I do agree  with some of  the reviews, we had an appointment at 10:15am we got there about 10:00am did the paperwork and all, waited for 1:30 min until my kid became restless so I decided to check, finally the doctor came out did his wannabe inspection ( open my kids mouth, with no gloves, took pictures of her denture with his phone) just to tell us what we already knew neither my wife I liked that. Still we remain seated to talk to the doctor over the things again we already knew, never did he offered or said what the solution was, just had us book an appointment 3 months down the road. Wow that's just great.
Yes the  doctor has his own way of handling the kids, the idea of befriending the kid is great, but the way he handles the parents is horrible, like I said thanks to the reviews I was able to hold back and not punch him. I do not need to be sosh  so rudely nor do I need to be told how to handle my kid.  You would think that some one that has a PhD, drives a 85k car would have manners but I guess money doesn't buy that. Hey doctor since apperently you read the revies,please do keep in mind we are the source of you driving and having what you have.
No you can't please everyone, but as a customer you should laid the red carpet for us, not us not for you. Or is that how the treat you at Ruth Chris? . Do not compare your clinic to Disney, saying they don't get 5 stars neither. No no one can please everyone but they get millions of millions of visitors and if they don't please everyone is understandable do you get millions of patients? ????.
Advise to you, you have enough personal to prepare parents of your way of handling the kids.
You have enough personal for the schedule to run fluently. If not, I'm sure you can lower the model of your tesla and hire more personal to keep your patrons happy and your business running.< /Review>

<review>Dr. Sadek is very professional and caring. He was able to get my toddler to open his mouth without having staff restrained him like many other dental facilities do for check ups and cleanings. He had my toddler opening his mouth and allowing him to see inside while Dr. Sadek played with him and read a book for him. This was amazing! He wants to go back to the dentist. Seeing my toddler cooperate reduced my anxiety level and I don't worry about dental visits anymore. My 9 year old loves going to the dentist too. Dr. Sadek has a neat video game set up where my child plays while they work on his teeth. He wants to stay on the dentist chair even after they are done because his game is not over. Dental visits are no longer traumatizing.< /review>< Pictures>

After moving to palmdale from the valley witch is a 45min drive away.  My husband convinced me to find our girls a dentist rather than driving so far when appointment time comes.  I checked other places out especially there reviews but PALMDALE CHILDREN'S DENTAL Caught my eyes 👀 with there high star 🌟 rating and good review.  I called instantly and was greeted by a pleasant voice, wasn't put on hold and was very nice.  I wish I could remember her name.  Appointment was for the next day and the staff there blew my mind. They were so polite and helpful.  The 2 dental assistants who were both girls took my 4yr old to do xrays I was amazed how good they were with children especially my picky daughter who never wants anything done.  Teeth cleaning was next and I was overjoyed how much time they spent making my daughter feel comfortable they explained every step of the way to her as she watched the Frozen movie her favorite.  Turns out she has 2 cavities, and needs to come back.  I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone who has kids.  I'm such a picky mom, but I love ❤ this place and everyone in it.  Thank you so much for making my 4yr old feel right at home 🏠 and not scared.  I wish I had a dentist like this when I was young.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Since July 2019 it was the last time my children went to the dentist and since then they have canceled because according to them they do not have the person to do dental cleaning and if I do not call them I do not even realize that they canceled my son's appointment again😠 👎 .... and they say the same version all the time ... WE LOVE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

(Original)
Desde Julio del 2019 fue la última ves que fueron mis hijos al dentista y desde entonces tienen cancelando porque según ellos no tienen la persona para hacer limpieza dental y si no les llamo YO ni cuenta me doy que volvieron a cancelar la cita de mi hijo😠👎....y dicen la misma versión todo el tiempo...PESIMO SERVICIO AL CLIENTE.< /Text>

Gave a good estimate on the clogged toilet. Started unclogging but the problem is further down.  Toilet has to be removed. Ricardo gave a new and still fair estimate.  Finally he pulled out a bunch of paper from pipe and problem is solved.  Placed back the toilet with new wax ring  and resealed the floor.   Restroom was very clean when he called me for inspection. Strongly recommend Premier Rooter and Plumbing!!< /Review>< user_id>

Omg please stop looking for shady plumbers who charge an arm and a leg and call Premier. I needed to pass an inspection regarding some plumbing work under my kitchen sink. When Ricardo & his team came, they were professional, polite, and respectful. They saw that there was actually no need to repair anything, that they can't repair something that's not broken! Ricardo wrote a report for me, Free of charge, stating that the pipes and valves were completely fine. Thank you so so much what a huge burden lifted from my  shoulders!!< /review>

I appreciate doing business with them and will call them in the future if needed and will definitely pass on their info to anyone who needs their services.

These guys where awesome. Ricardo was very attentive and answered all my questions. Him and his part where very through with their work and tried to help out the best they could. Unfortunately my problems they could not completely solve because of water in my walls. Very much recommend and ask for Ricardo!</Review>

I needed a water line installed for my new refrigerator. I called Premier a day before (Which I may add, were very quick to respond) my installation date. They set me up a date the next day with full flexibility of my time. The day of my installation they provided a text link that displays the tracking/location of the installer (John). The work was pristine, fast, and efficient. I would highly recommend them to anyone in need.</review>

These guys are pros! Ruben explained the pros and cons of the various type of water heaters with extreme detail and ensured all our questions were answered. They replaced our water heater on New Year’s Eve with a smile on their face. I will continue using their services for all plumbing needs!

< Review>
I called to see if they could assist with a plumbing issue for my company and the only thing he said was that they "didn't have anything available for today, sorry". He did not provide the soonest availability or anything. Didn't seem too willing to assist to be such a highly rated company. Wouldn't recommend.<//Review>

<Text>Delbert was very professional, knowledgeable and super helpful. He replaced pieces on my leaky outdoor sink faucet easily and was able to pick up the parts the very same day where others told me they'd have to order them and I'd have to wait. The price was much more reasonable than others that quoted me via texts and pictures and I appreciate this business takes time to actually send someone out to look at the issue in person.
I also received helpful information on my water softener and was sent quotes I requested for future projects in a very timely manner. I will definitely be using Premier again for any future plumbing projects.<//Text>< Pics>

Slab leak a few days before Thanksgiving!!! These guys took care of me! Best service I've ever had when dealing with plumbers, contractors, etc. John, Mike, and Ruben made sure my new water heater was installed and my busted pipe was fixed ASAP. They had to reroute hot and cold water pipes as well and did an outstanding job! A++ costumer service!!!< /review>

Izzy & Ricardo was excellent. They answered all of my questions in a professional manner. They explained everything to me before they did any work. They quoted me prices up front. They didn’t pressure me to do any service. I believe they are two honest men, please continue to keep up the great work, I recommend premier rooter & plumbing.</Text>

I called on a weekend, never fails something always goes wrong on a weekend! Called on Saturday and was scheduled for Sunday with no premium charge, can't beat that, I had Salvador, he was awesome, polite and really professional. My drain must have been really clogged because not only did he have to use a 75' snake and it took quite awhile, he got the job done, cleaned up the mess and didn't leave until he was positive the job was done.. the price was more than reasonable , they aren't like "Plummer's" I've had many over the years and this has been the Best one so far.. call these guys, you won't be sorry... now it's fixed so I guess I have to do the dishes now!!' Thanks again Premier😄<//text>

Ricardo and Mike were friendly, professional and timely in my needs. They did a fast swap of my old water heater to a new one and now I have hot water again. Overall the service and communication was great. The price was ok, could have been a little cheaper. I would recommend to anyone who needs a quick replacement of a water heater< /Review>

Had a clogged main sewage line. Made the call that morning and cleared the blockage with ease that same day. Not only that, they showed me video of the internal pipe/sewage system, explained pros and cons of my current situation, and what I should do to prevent further blockages and how to improve my plumbing/drains in my house.

Couldn't be more pleased with the service that was provided. Both Ricardo and Josh were friendly, knowledgeable, and a pleasure to work with.

Great service from start to finish.  Eddie and Ozzie showed great professionalism and pride in their work.  Hard workers.  Ricardo responded quickly and gave an accurate estimate.  He saved me a lot of money by figuring out an alternative to what I feared would be using jackhammers.   Nothing but kudos to Premiere.<//Text>

< Review>
First time client. Ricardo came to look for a leak because my water usage was up substantially. He thoroughly checked every valve and meter in our home. He gave us a brief about what he had done and charged us NOTHING for his time. He referred us to a leak detection firm if we were still concerned but recommended we wait because of his findings. It is so refreshing to find a company that does not create business by finding false problems. I will call Premier for all future plumbing needs and suggest you do the same. Thank you Premier Plumbing.<//Review>

Premier Rooter & Plumber is by far the best plumbing company you will find in San Diego. I bought a house that needed so much plumbing work and after around 7 different plumbers I finally found Premier. Not only did they provide superior, professional and articulate work, but you simply can't beat the value. They stick to their word, recommended the best recommendations, and provide above-level industry standard workmanship. Mike Minjarem, Ricardo, and the rest of the guys are absolutely fantastic!
In addition to plumbing, they also are licensed in contracting and replaced my entire flooring as well as renovated the bathroom. They kept in communication and put my desires and needs first.
I would highly recommend them!!< /review>

<Review>Excellent customer service!!!  I highly recommend. Arrived on schedule and provided me with a written estimate. They were able to start the job on the same day. I had an intrusion of tree roots in a fifty foot landscaping drain which was completely clogged from draining. Ricardo accessed the problem, walked me through the solution and provided me with an estimate.

Ricardo and Marco proceeded to clean out a 30 foot long root along with other rocks, dirt, etc which had settled in the drain. They both were extremely professional, friendly and experienced during the entire job. They explained the whole process from start to finish.

Bottom line is they provided the professional, excellent service I was looking for and I would use and refer Premier Rooter and Plumbing to anyone looking for a professional plumbing experience.< /Review>< Rating>

Premier  was the only other company that had the exact same warranty for their maintenance and labor and also for the water heater itself compared to Anderson and it was significantly cheaper! Shout out to Ruben Toeldano who help with the removal and install of the water heater  and Ricardo Sandoval for coming out and situating the finance part!<//review>

Salvador and Ricardo were dispatched out through my property management company for a clogged drain that I've had issues with for months. They cleared out the drain quickly and even cleaned up the mess that was left in the shower and toilet. Definitely a professional job which is very appreciated.< /Text>

They came immediately to our report of a leaking & garage flooding hot-water heater! Their service response & clear, excellent knowledge, along with their obvious experience, put us at ease. Everything was explained to us. There were no hidden fees or unexpected costs, and they were VERY respectful of our property and personal items, along with keeping a clean work area. They took our old tank away, and provided an AWESOME value for the services provided!!

I would recommend them to anyone needing any kind of plumbing work done!< /Review>

We identified a plumbing issue in our office around 3:00 on a Tuesday afternoon. We contacted Premier plumbing and they came within the hour. They not only diagnosed the problem but immediately did some troubleshooting and addressed a bigger issue in a timely fashion.  They were motivated to resolve the issue the same day so it doesn’t interfere with our business operations in Wednesday. Jesse & his team did a great job. I was impressed and that very evening everything was fixed!  Great job! Highly recommended!!< /Review>

Great service and in depth explanation on my problem. I called for a non-emergency and scheduled a team to arrive at my house the following morning. Ricardo Sandoval called before he came to my house and arrived at the exact time as expected. He was very friendly and quickly asked questions and found the problem with my drainage. Within 30 minutes, Ricardo had a crew working and cleaned plus fixed my problems. I had some other concerns and asked if they can review and quote for a future job, as I feel comfortable with the fact that they will do a professional and thorough job.<//Review>

First technician that came by gave me quotes that for two options for replacing a toilet flange.  The quote was in-line with another plumber's quote but I thought both were excessive.  The Owner of Premier Rooter & Plumbing offered me a substantial discount.  The technician that completed the work was very nice and explained everything he was doing.  Very happy with the job!</Review>

Called at 7:45 in the evening as we had a shower that had broken and we couldn’t turn off the water. Mike answered and gave us an estimate over the phone and told us he would be there within the hour. Got there as promised and fixed our shower. Was courteous, professional, and the best price we got after calling several other plumbers. Excellent service and would definitely recommend. Will be using Premier Rooter & Plumbing from now on for any of our plumbing services.</Text>

<Text>He was friendly upfront and was here within 30 mins. Stayed to make sure everything was satisfactory before he left (this was at 8:30pm on a weekend). For me personally I would recommend putting them in your contacts BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW when your going to need help.< /Text>< Pics>

I called Premier Plumbing. Delbert came in and first replaced a bathroom cartridge that was preventing our toilet tank from filling up. He also installed a Halo Filtration System and today fixed a leaking Master Bathroom toilet. They were very proficient and professional. I highly recommend Premier Plumbing to anyone.</Review>

<Text>I called Premire Plumbing on recommendation from my brother who used them in an emergency at his house the week prior to the incident at my mother’s.  My mother’s house is old so it requires yearly maintenance issues, after the Thanksgiving Holiday the sink in her garage developed a slow drain which eventually led to a blocked line, the sink in the garage is lowest point of the drain system at the house.  I tried to clear it with a 25’ snake that I have and has normally taken care of the issue but not this time.  I needed a professional, called Premire Plumbing after 3:00 on a Monday afternoon, they responded quickly, after an attempt to clear it was determined that a hydro jet would be needed in order clear the line of grease and sludge.  I later found out that the sink had been used for cleaning Thanksgiving pots and pans and some other misuses as well.  The hydro jet took care of the problem and I have a 6 month guarantee. The price was steep but I would call them back in heartbeat if necessary, very professional, experienced and hard working. I definitely got my money’s worth.

Sincerely,
T. Vasquez< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>The HOA required all of us in the condominium complex to change our valves connected to the washing machine... however it will cost us $450 or more so we decided to get a different plumber company to do the work.. we called them and they responded and send their agent immediately.. it only took them less than an hour to do the job and we saved $150 which really great!< /Text>< rating>

<text>Mike M. was prompt returning my initial call. He came to my house the same day within a couple of hours. He assessed the water heater. It's been leaking water for days in the garage. Mike asked for the original paperwork on the unit and determined that it is still under warranty! He immediately called the manufacturer and within minutes got an approval and confirmation/authorization number to bring to Home Depot for a brand new one. There was some proration but very minimal. Mike was forthcoming on how much he will charge for total labor cost. Mike and his assistant and my husband went to Home Depot, brought the old water heater and exchanged for a brand new one. Mike even gave us a pan for free that he had in his truck. Overall, we are very satisfied with Mike's service and forthcomingness. We will highly recommend him to friends and family.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Some pipes in my house were banging and making a racket  whenever I used the washing machine or or hose in the back yard.  I looked through Yelp reviews and Angie’s List and found Premier Rooter & Plumbing and I am very glad that I found them.  Jesse came out to give me an estimate and after talking to him I felt very comfortable with letting him run the shows coworker showed up to help and in less than two hours the job was completed and no more banging.  I highly recommend them for any of your plumbing needs and will be calling them again for some renovations.</text>

I contacted dispatch and they answered right alway and gave me all the answers to all the complicated questions I had. She was very professional and had someone come out with in 30 minutes and the gentlemen that arrived was the name of John Calderson ..... Very professional and didnt try to sale me on buying stuff i didnt need and knocked out the job in a really short period of time. Was on time for his appointment and I could tell he knew what he was doing. I would recommend him to anybody if you need work to be done .... There company are very military friendly and helpped me out with giving me a break with the bill. Happy hoildays to him and to who ever is the boss of this gentlemen better give him a raise ..... Young people with great trade skills are very hard to find now adays ....! I would give a million stars but i really will be coming back to John for anymore of my needs bless you John for not just doing your job but really caring about how the job is done and getting it done in a professional matter.

Ps.... Supervisor better give him a promotion

Thank you Jacob S Gurrola</review>

I broke a pipe in my backyard, luckily my neighbor knew how to turn off the water, because I had a 6 foot geyser. I called another plumber 1st, & after waiting 2 hours, I called them back & they told me they didn't have anyone available that day. Jesse Salcido arrived quickly & went out of his way to fix it & to install a shut-off valve & an attachment for future water needs. Yay!< /review>

Finally have found our go to plumber. Have been trying out plumbers for years and never going back to same one. Well the search is over. Raul came right on time the same day as I called, fixed the problem quickly and efficiently and then actually only charged me the quoted rate! Excellent!!</Review>

Mike was great very professional estimate and assessment of the problem was spot on. High def video of damage to main sewage pipe was great I could see for myself how bad it was.  Work was completed in half the day I thought it would take days. His staff was very quick to work with us got us scheduled with no problem. So If your looking for a great plumbing company go with Premier you will not be disappointed.  I have already recommended him to all family and friends.< /Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80d94dc72f2f325d:0x3b45556e03b9f75a</Gmap_id><Text>I had a sluggish shower drain that seemed to get worse with every shower. This started a couple days after I had the shower walls and shower deck retiled and entire bath renovated by a contractor. In that I never had the drain problem before, and I could have run a snake myself,  however, I feared mortar must have got in the pipes and wanted a thorough rotor rooter with the holidays coming up and family coming in from out of town. I hired Premier Rotor & Plumbing  via Home Advisor. It was a sound decision and happy I did. Once I hired Premier, R & P for the job, everything went smoothly and timely. Coordination on arrival and who onsite tech would be was all done via  text. John C from Premier R & P arrived as advertised, even earlier. Very customer oriented. Provided sound and sensible analysis of problem and the solution. I was impressed with his professionalism and demonstrated skills.  I would definitely hire them again. I have already had John do an appraisal for a job I wanted done after the Holidays. Thanks for job well done.</Text><Time>1542331965820<//Time>< name>

Fast Excellent service with a smile. Thanks for doing a great job clearing my drains, finding the problem (roots & baby wipes) & for honoring my expired coupon- i recommend Premier to everyone looking for a plumber, because of their great customer service & affordable honest prices.

Danny is the best! His auto shop has always been honest with fair prices. They'll let you know what work you need or don't need on your car. Me and my whole family has been going to tri auto for years. Highly recommend this auto shop!< /review>

Tri Auto has been my primary auto mechanics since 2015. Danny is the person in charged. He is very experienced and charge fee reasonably. The problem is that due to good reviews they are getting a lot more customers and Danny is so occupied much of the time. I would say the service level is not as good as before. However I still rank tri auto five star at this point of time.
They originally was located in 9th st and was recently moved to Schaefer. The new location is much more spacious.<//text>

<Time>1606163456440</Time><Review>When I asked co-workers for a recommendation for an honest car repair place, four of them recommended Danny at Tri Auto Repair.  We took him the older Honda my son had just bought to see if there was anything that needed immediate repair.  He was very honest and talked plainly.  He didn't find anything we had to do and told us what to watch out for down the road.  We will definitely go back there when anything does got wrong and for the basics.  We are happy to have found someone we can trust.</Review>< gmap_id>

I stop taking my car.. cause at time I felt like instead of help me he was billing me more.. fixing part without my consent. I look online for parts he charge me and found out he was over pricing me. Not going back. Thanks for nothing...</text>

<Text>My family and I have been coming to Danny and his guys for past 15 years... service on all our Japanese vehicles has always been on point as well as being very honest and reliable he has very fair prices compared to other shops. Especially for the top tier service and quality of work you know your car will be receiving as well as the peace of mind knowing your vehicle is in great hands, recommended anyone looking for a new honest mechanic to come here you will not be disappointed!<//Text>< pics>

<review>Danny is a very honest mechanic. Very busy and I can understand why. If he can’t repair the issue on your vehicle he recommends someone in that field of work who is just as good as he is. Great prices and good work. Been going to Tri-Auto for years.

<Review>For years my best friend had been telling me about this auto repair shop.  I regret not going to them sooner.  The owner, Danny, is super friendly, and most importantly, HONEST!  Prices are reasonable and there are never any hidden costs or surprises, Danny is up front and honest.  If you want the job done right without the prices hikes, this is the place to go!</Review>< username>

The BEST service you will receive for your automobiles! Danny has been our mechanic for MANY years, and we don't go to anyone else. I now reside in San Fernando Valley and I only get my oil changes at Tri-Auto! He is honest, fair, and just an all-around mechanic that you can trust!<//review>

<Text>I had my check engine light on which toyota service center told me charge of 130 dollars. But one of my friend recommended tri auto repair. They were fast and very helpful. They figured out problem in minutes and fixed it. I was very satisfied with their service.< /Text>< pictures>

The most honest mechanics you will ever come into contact.  Will tell you the truth about the problems in your car.  Will also go out of his way to be sure you are happy with the finish product. Only honest mechanics compared to other shops.< /review>

A man named Danny owns this place and he is the most awesome mechanic I have met. He is honest and hard-working as well as the other gentlemen that work with him. He will not go you with high prices he will tell you what you need done and that's all he will do unless you ask for more. He is very trustworthy and honest and I will go there before I go anywhere else ever again and he doesn't just work on Toyotas. He has worked on my husband's Honda and my Chevy pickup. And his prices have always been more than reasonable.<//review>

Tri Auto has been our trusted shop for years now.  His work, prices, and ethic are good.  Sometimes there is a long wait but when you want something done right...  Danny (the owner) has never overcharged me or try to up sell me on doing more than what is needed.  Good man!</review>

<Text>I have been coming in for years.  Danny is honest and knows what is wrong with your
automobile.  There is no Easter egging around trying for find the problem.  The word got out
and the shop is very busy but quality counts in my book.  Call him ahead of time and just drop if off
in the am and pick it up before closing, its that easy.< /Text>< pics>

I have never had good luck finding a good mechanic and my father in law usually works on my cars. However my father in law was not able to find out what was wrong with my car this time. I looked up review for local auto shops and seen he had great reviews. This place was AWESOME! Danny gave me a quote and when i picked up the car I actually paid $15 less. HONESTY means a lot, had my car done by the end of the day I will continue to go back, I wont be going anywhere else.</text>

<Review>I won't take my cars anywhere else. Danny (the owner) is the most honest mechanic I've ever met. He works hard and you can trust him. I've since referred all of my family and friends to him and they all come back saying the same thing. Nice, hard working and honest! Not sure what I'll do if he ever retires.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

MR steak took 2-3 attempts to get to proper temperature, complimentary creme brûlée first attempt tasted like burnt birthday candles without the sugar layer. Blamed on not having the proper glassware for dessert (probably should invest in proper glassware for dessert on the menu...)Fortunately one of our guest appreciated the effort for the first attempt. Silver lining, server was very pleasant when present, otherwise, service was difficult to be found. Would not recommend for quality food and attentiveness. Had to stand up and look for assistance so we could close our tab.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
1st. Time there to eat dinner. The food was good. My husband was asked by our waitress 3 different times if he wanted a refill on his (hot water) tea his glass still 1/2 full. The waitress totally ignored me & my EMPTY glass od cold tea only ice cubes left in my glass. Finally as I waited & waited my husband called out to her firmly; " My wife needs more tea her glass is empty!" So finally I got more tea. I then left the restaurant to get some fresh air much needed as my husband finished paying the bill.
FYI on my experience... If your a guy your waitress service will be very good! Exceptional!<//Review>

One of the best food and beverage option in downtown. Both inside and outdoor seating available. I loved the ambience of outdoor seating. Very good and fast service. Friendly staff. Highly recommend.</text>

Definitely recommend this place. We booked a reservation with less than 24 hours notice for a wedding party of 30-35 people and they accomdated us more than we could have ever asked for. We weren't expecting a private room or anything, just tables to fit all of us after the  ceremony. In addition to the private room, they set it up to make it look as elegant as possible - linen table cloths, flowers in vases, and tables setup in a large square to make it look more like a reception dinner instead of a last minute reservation. The bartender Luis was the one I spoke to on the phone and he was so helpful in getting it setup for us and making sure we were happy with everything. He went out of his way and made sure everything was perfect for us. Not only that, we had excellent service from our waitresses and quick service from the kitchen in getting our food and drinks to us. We really couldn't have even imagined a better dinner there. We are so grateful and appreciate everything the staff at Echo did for us. Everyone loved how it turned out and we were all in awe of how awesome it turned out to be with last minute plannings. They went above and beyond and we would definitely recommend this place!< /review>

Food was over priced. Salmon fish and chips were good but very small. Side of scallops was seven dollars and three small pieces. French dip was dry and had no flavor. Kid's burgers were over done. Atmosphere was nice, won't ever come back.< /review>

Friendly staff.  Kid friendly.  TVs to watch while eating.  Food somewhat small serving.  Variety of food to choose from.  We went to this place because the location is very convenient, located inside the hotel we stayed.  Overall nice restaurant with very good food.< /Text>

We sat down this Sunday evening at 4:30, and waited 10 minutes in the restaurant that was almost empty. The only staff was a young woman bar tending. She never once acknowledged us. The restaurant is clearly understaffed and underrenevated for such a high-priced restaurant. We are staying at the hotel and wanted to check it out. Wonderful hotel, but we decided to leave the restaurant after no attendance.<//Review>

The shabu-shabu was fun to eat, and very tasty. But it wasn't cheap for 2.

Service was excellent.

I actually came in with moderate expectations and left very satisfied. This restaurant looks kind of like an afterthought connected on to the Lake Tahoe Vacation Resort Hotel.< /review>

Absolutely abhorrent!  My family and I stayed at the resort and we're eating outside on the porch.  It took an obscene amount of time to order and receive it.  After arriving food was prepared incorrectly, missing items, and salad contained brown lettuice.  The manager indicated he would comp this.  It further took another 20 minutes and several servers to verify this before we could leave.  For the money and Tahoe prestige this place falls short; draining this much time out of our Friday for two burgers and a salad.</review>

Went on a friday night with some friends. Atmosphere was nice. Sat outside on their patio and listened to the live DJ. Service was excellent and friendly. The thing that brought down my score was my food. I ended up getting the french dip. Im not surprised that it was 15 bucks for my meal as it seems every place in tahoe seems to jack their prices up due to their expensive resort town status. However for that price i would expect to get more than just a tiny basket of fries.  The au jus sauce was the nail in the coffin though. It was so bland! And despite that fact, I was considering myself lucky that the sandwich alone was pretty good because they only supplied enough bland au jus to supply half the sandwich. I'd come back if i had to, but id rather try out a few other places before that happens.< /review>

I think if the restaurant on a resort 4 hours drive from Bay Area they might as well close doors and leave space for a better managed business.<//Text><gmapID>0x80999077cd58ce05:0xb7810de63cab0537< /gmapID><name>Kostyantyn Kechedzhi</name>< userid>

<Review>My wife and I stayed at Lake Tahoe Resort in early June/17 and had dinner twice at their Echo restaurant.  Nice place, friendly staff, clean, and not a crowded set up with the tables/booths.  A good variety of food offerings.  Fair priced compared to similar restaurants in the area but the best thing is that there is no driving involved.
If you like ahi tuna steak seared and served raw you MUST have it there.  It was laid over a bed of rice cake/risotto with Asian slaw topped with thin slices of ginger.  The sauce they used over the ahi was absolutely delicious.  I always order seared ahi whenever it is on any menu but I have to say this was the absolute by far best I've ever had.  Wife had a delicious grilled chicken breast dish which she totally enjoyed.
The next night we decided to have burgers and thought we'd go to one of those restaurants nearby but then checked out the natural grass fed burgers at Echo and decided why would we go to a sports type bar restaurant when we can get better meat at a place as nice as Echo.  Fair priced and delicious burgers!!< /Review>< pics>

The food was awful!
The french onion soup was lukewarm and served on a cut-out onion. It was exactly four small tablespoons full and it cost $8.
My roast beef sandwich was cooked/dried out on the grill beyond belief.  The bread was so hard it was inedible.
Stay away!<//text>

< Review>
Worst customer service ever...they sat us down outside and gave us water then we waited for more than 15min...i dont mind the waiting but there was servers all over the place and even the one that sat us down was at the front looking stright at us and notice that nobody was tending to us and didnt even say a thing...and they where not busy at all, more tables open than customers there.< /Review>

You can park on the street right off the trailhead and walk as far as you like.  Not a ton of shade, so bring water, wear sunscreen and a hat...or your gonna have a bad time.👍< /text>< pics>

<Name>Binu B<//Name><Time>1526054424707</Time><Rate>4<//Rate><review>We thoroughly enjoyed hiking the upper Las Virgines canyon preserve.  We started from the gate at the end of Las Virgines road (near Malibu Canyon Apartments). Take a right once you enter , keep going and take the left after crossing the fenced dish tower.  We took the next left for canyon view. Which was amazing. Little steep towards the end  but should be fine for a person with average  fitness. Please don't get deterred by the dog poop every where on the trail, hope some one take action on that though. Irresponsible dog owners should not be allowed in the trail.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Fantastic park space that ties into Cheeseboro on the west and Victory Trail-head on the east. Mostly fire roads with some single track that if you are paying attention you'll find.  Gets really hot so bring water and a hat because there is no shade. Avoid after a rain as the trails turn into giant mud pits.</review>< UserId.>

Seriously impressed.  Small town feel, comparative city prices.  Clean, comfortable waiting area with climate control, snacks, and beverages, even toys for kids to play with. Not that you will be waiting long.<//review>

Quick and friendly service. Had my diesel pickup oil change done and full service with windows washed and floor vacuumed only cost like $10 or $20 more than doing it myself in the driveway but twice as fast and no mess! Ill be a repeat customer for sure</Text>

My husband said " I'm going to Main Street Lube for now on."  Yes we been here before, but my husband was really impressed this time.  Chris and his crew were awesome.  Jake also mentioned, double the donuts and double the size of the waiting room, it was nice.  So thumbs up for Chris and his crew.   Jake and Mary</text>

We had to stop and get the oil changed on our way out of town. The staff was so friendly and they got us in and out quickly. They had a really nice waiting room with toys for my young nephews to play with. It was a great experience. I'll be returning for sure.< /Review>

Very friendly.  I showed the tech how to shift the manual valve body ratchet shifter in my truck. He did just fine with it after that.  No worries leaving your modified vehicle here.< /Review>

Chris(head honcho(as far as I know lol)) is very kind and respectful, the waiting area is very clean and comfortable with toys for the kids, the bathroom is very well maintained and clean. Service is done quickly and efficiently. Overall a great stop for an oil change for a low price if u have ur own oil (oil provided there as well). Also I was third in line maybe second and was in and out in less then 90min. Staff again very respectful and attentive to your needs =D<//review>

<Text>In March 11, 2021 Breecia Hartman of SDHC contacted my family through email in regards to an available unit in a building located off 44th ave near Fairmount Ave. We submitted the applications, Identification, Income, Rental verification forms signed by our current landlord electronucally. We also printed the forms and the $60 for the application fee in drop box located at  4391 Rl Cajon Blvd Charlen Lizardi was the person of contact and the building On-site Property Manager. She delayed processing (I have all the emails) our applications. I reported my concerns to the SDHC Ombudsman program via the SDHC website. I was informed by email that a Kyesha Smith would process our applications, however she suddenly needed to leave the office, before she could process them. Now our applications were given to a Shirley Robinson and she did not process them either. We did receive an email from Kristin Molloy of Kimball, Tirey &ST. John, LLP informing us that we lied on our application about being evicted and SDHC were unable to reach our current landlord. We have a copy of the original online rental report that was supplied by SDHC processed April 2, 2021 it has nothing about evictions. Also we have a text message from our landlord requesting a different to contact SDHC to verify our residence and an email to Kyesha Smith requesting a different phone number for rental confirmation. Kyesha Smith never responded. I reported it HUD they stated they cannot assist me and because of this on April 12, 2021 our credit has been damaged. We are native Americans and maybe this has a lot to do with our experience with the SDHC. I have even attempted to reach out to Richard Gentry, with no success. This would had been a great opportunity for our tribe to save money and purchase a home in the future. Welp on to another dream...< /Text>< pics>

<text>I am so disappointed that I wasn't notified by all the agencies I've reached out to since this pandemic happened and I lost my job and a place to live with my 3yr old! This is the 1st time I heard about the covid 19 housing assistance and it hurts so much to see it is now closed! I swear to God that I never seen this program on social media or heard about it from anyone! It seems to me and others in my situation that the ones who get blessed with housing , most where never even truly homeless like us! This is truly sad</text>< UserId.>

Wow!  Worse experience waiting for the operator to take your call.  Had to hang up after 10 minutes and this was not the first time I called.  Where is the help when you need it?  I understand we are low income but don’t make us feel like second class citizens!<//Text>

Sept 14th, 2019
I just called and a woman answered the phone that did not speak very good English,  nor dud she understand my very simple questions about housing or if they had any tax credit properties that may be opening.
BTW I used to be an ESL teacher that taught children english...
Anyway...I asked if I could speak to someone that may know more. She then asked if I was a landlord.  I said no, she asked who I was. I again asked her if there was someone I could speak with that may have information on where I can look for a disabled person 60 plus. She had no information. So I asked for the website. Seriously I have called about 4 times in 2 weeks. No one calls you back if you reach someone that has NO clue!
San Diego housing, needs to get it together!< /Text>

The lady at the desk knows nothing.  The only email they have in their website never replies. The lady at the desk transfers you to people who never take their calls and everything goes to voicemail.</text>

I can verify that what all the 1 start comments are saying are in fact truth sadly. This is a government funded organization that misuses its funds. Just Google "sdhc lawsuit" and you will see what I mean. I'm not going to list my whole battle with them but I will say if you leave a message for the president Mr. Gentry you may have a chance at being heard instead of brushed off by low level employees and passed around by 1 low level to another. Of course they never gave me his number and played dumb like they didn't know who the president was. So, I went to their website and found their staff and when I called the sdhc number I searched him and other staff by name and successfully got through to their assistants or voicemail. Also, I escalated my case by reporting them to the California department of fair housing and employment, legal aid, and San Diego tenants union. If you qualify even seek the NAACP for assistance. These people need to be put in their place for abusing the government and state funds, mistreating the clients, not doing their duties, and for perpetuating segregation between "classes". Just search the lawsuit like I said and you can probably join. Lastly, make sure you document eveything! I always have someone with me or 3 way call as a witness. I also take pictures of my envelopes I drop off and of my name on the sign in sheet. I also email the pictures to my other email to make sure they dont accidentally get erased from my gallery or Google photos. These people cannot be trusted by any means and I sadly have to be crafty in my documentation as well as witnesses to what dirty lengths these people go to screw you over.< /text>

They are bad and illegally allow the landlord to raise the rent after they didn’t seek approval by section 8 to began with. Then after they find out they said it was the owner mistake and still allow the rent to be increased after there is a policy to seek approval from section 8 and allow 60 days for approval this is a shame and a complaint eventually will be filed.</Text>

Awful program geared towards illegals-It's so sad that most of the vouchers are taken up by the Mexicans. Then they rant and rave how things aren't Going exactly right for them. meanwhile thousands of American citizens are waiting in line  for help while the Mexicans are here illegally with their children are getting free rent vouchers food & health insurance. Housing authority is NOT doing a good job by allowing this to continue.<//text>

Horrible assistance, raising rent, making it even harder to live in San Diego. By far worst organization to get help from, 2nd to Father Joe's Village, which also lacks assistance</Review>

<review>Awful terrible, they are allowed to be sickening abusive.....& there is really NO apartments, or  housing, it's below bad, san Diego is terribly over priced. Not affordable. If you qualify after a 10 year wait there is nothing to choose from....nothing.....I called about 50 places all said Rudly , "no way" I don't recommend for anyone. It's awful bad. The Super few places are "full on ghetto",  gross, but to even find those is months of work.....but you would not want to live there.....& again, the staff at San Diego housing is soooooo meannnnnn.......soooooo bad abusive RUDE. People need to get counciling just to deal with them.
San Diego prices are too too high......nothing is affordable. Sad sad sad......the housing authority employees need to be retrained or better yet fired, especially managment.</review><date>1548807947030<//date><rate>1</rate><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

I did a transfer thinking it would bring my family and I a better future only to find out that there is no homes for section 8 they say go to zilow and other web sites that do not or very rarely accept this program if at all. Section 8 has a program that helps with your deposit and that's nice right? WRONG! the zip codes given are in rich areas and let's be real they do not care to help anyone rent out their homes so I didn't find not one house they pretend to help but make it impossible if they know how low the housing is why accept a transfer..idiot's! Well I'm transfering back to where I was and san diego you can stick it you know where. What a shame.<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Im not on section 8 but after reading all the comments from everybody I am disgusted with your program and I think you guys should be audited and investigated because from the looks of it your program is more worried about their paycheck than their clients. How much does one of your SDHC employee make a year? Let alone management? Let me guess, $100,000 per head? when that money can cover dozens of housings for all those who need it...your program needs to be ABOLISHED. No wonder poverty is thru the roof lately! Sad! That's what happens when you have a mayor for San Diego who's Republican. They're greedy and they want to keep the money and all the funds to themselves! They'll make up all this b******* that they're doing it for the people but really they're doing it for the paychecks!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Before I got married we had asked the case worker if it was okay for my husband to move in after the wedding and she said that She needed proof of the marriage and proof that I am pregnant. We provided that proof and have a receipt showing we gave that proof. Now we got a 90 day notice from our manager and we had asked the case worker if we could up our valture to a three-bedroom because we have a child on the way. She said no. Why?  BC my husband is not approved on section 8 BC she FAILED to put in the effing system that we are married and I have a child on the way. She threatened to take away our housing valture BC she FAILED to put any of the proof of marriage and proof that I am pregnant into our case. They are a waste of time. They are no help. They lie. They threaten. They just plain do not care.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80d95454ffffffff:0x2e2d4eff838c0784< /gmapID></record>

<Review>I am a resident at university heights apartment complex and there are certain residents who throw football in the street and yell and get onto my patio and have no regard for the other tenants peace and quiet.  I have talked to at least 5 or 6 managers and still nothing has been done.  I am treated like I am the problem.  When I ask them to move on, they ignore me and continue to disturb the tenants.  I guess my next step is to go downtown and go up the ladder.< /Review></record>

Currently requesting Administrative  Hearing to review claims of fraud , misconduct, gross mismanagement, breech of contract, unethical practices and procedures, causing extreme financial hardship homelessness and ultimately the loss of custody of my only son (who just turned eight) to his abusive father.  This is all do to errors made.by the San Diego Housing Commission.
Seeking Reinstatement of Voucher under the FUP Program.   Priority rapid rehousing  financial assistance for moving expenses, as well as monetary reimbursement for out of pocket expenses, damages pain and suffering and total loss of households contents, hotel and car rentals ,  personal debts incurred,  reverse eviction,  formal apology, lawyers fees and opportunity to receive all necessary and available services including case management as well as the implementation of one on one sessions  to communicate and understand all housing needs.  A change must be made.  My experience has been so horribly tremendously bad that I am not and will not go away until somebody first acknowledges it, and second fixes it.  Until then as far as I am concerned they've destroyed my family and ruined my life!!!!!< /text>

I realize each worker's case load is maxed out and they may seem slow. But with sec 8 everything is a process, if feel they are neglecting your case, you have the right to submitt in writing your concern and drop it in the box...I have found that they will respond within 3 or 4 days. And for those 911 case's. You can go up stairs and request to see your worker. It may take a minute but you will get in to see them. I prefer to be the first one in the AM and ussually I'm seen within 15 minutes or so. Anytime past that and you have better packed a lunch. As far as being on the list we all know it's long, but there are places that can move you to the top of the list. Remember, they are not going to tell you who they are. The Vet's, Pact, Mental Health, Catholic Charitys, Father Joe's. It's up to you to do the footwork, don't fool yourselves thinking they are there to help you, their not, if you want something then YOU seek it out. SDHC will respect and honour that. Hope that helps. :-)<//review>

<text>Quick check in, friendly staff, and ideally located for me!  I went to Breastlink on Westminster Ave. in Garden Grove.  Only negative was the initial call to schedule, which came from a third party scheduler(Radnet?) that tried to schedule me quite a distance from my home (Santa Ana) instead of at the facility that is about a quarter mile from me.  I would have thought the staff were more familiar with their locations.  Sound quality was very poor on the three calls it took me to schedule the appointment!<//text>< pics>

Service was one of the best I have had. It was very well organized, clean, and friendly: once my appointment was scheduled, I was provided with information online including  the medical form to fill out, so the staff already had it ready before arriving. Via text staff kept me informed upon my arrival: for safety reasons (Covid -19 prevention) they asked me to wait in my car at the parking lot or in a shade outside (that way I didn’t came in contact with any body else), then they texted me when My techno was ready for me. Once there they were friendly, no wait line at all, ready to take me in, nice and clean. I felt safe. Te Mirian was very nice and patient.  Very well done!!!</Text>

My technician was Elsa—what a lovely lady!  I was in the building for another X-ray & the ladies at Breastlink graciously took me early. Very professional, easy procedure. The office is beautifully decorated & super clean.<//review>

With cash payment, the fee was very reasonable! Elsa(mammogram) was great, but I cannot say the same for Dexas... she didn’t explain anything and was so blunt.</Text>

I took my mom in for a mammogram and it went very quickly. They were very polite and accommodating to my mom's needs. My mom usually doesn't talk about the service she receives wherever she goes unless it's really good or really bad. She was quite happy with her experience. When my mom is happy, so am I.</review>

<Review>The technician was sick ! I saw her and asked if she was sick and she said no. During the test I heard her sniffing and coughing! Being in the medical field and with all the situation going on I will appreciate if personnel that is or might be sick stay home or at least wear a mask !! Very uncomfortable situation 😬<//Review>< user_name>

It was my first time there.  I was nervous.  I was there for a mammogram.  The receptionist was warm and helpful.  The lady that did my mammogram was professional, knowledgeable, and so kind.  She made me feel comfortable and at ease... thank you!!  The process was fast, smooth and painless.<//Text>

<Review>I’m 47 and For the first time I had a mammogram and my experience was  awesome!! Honestly I never wanted to go. I always try to avoid it cuz I herd a bad and painful experience from some of my friends and that’s why I was so nervous about it.. But now That I did it I  feel very happy that I went to this place because the lady  who attended me and did  the x-rays she was soo nice, so kind and careful.  Also all the stuff is so friendly and quick and the place is nice and clean.I definitely will recommend this place to all my friends.< /Review><user>106681772540693548337</user>< user_name>

<text>I really did not want to make or keep my appointment for the mammogram but it had been so long since my last that I bit the bullet - took the first appointment that was available - 9:15 PM which seemed strange being so late but I went.  The office is nothing fancy but it was calming.  The staff were welcoming - the wait was brief - the tech was so sweet & made sure I was as comfortable as possible.  All in all it was a positive experience & I'm grateful.

Thank you,

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>It was such a comforting experience that they let me have two different appointments in one visit. I opened the door, filled out some paperwork, and went in for the tests without a wait. It took less than an hour to do both appointments. The technicians were very nice too. It certainly was a great experience.
There was one thing I was concerned about, that was when one of the technicians kept coughing and she seemed like she was coming down with something. I am still worried if I got something from her...
But anyway, thank you for the nicely done quick work.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>I went in for my appt, was told bc my order wasnt signed by the doctor therefore the appt can't be done.

It was my first mammogram so I was a little nervous. The technician explained everything and made me feel very comfortable. I felt safe and well cared for.
I would highly recommend Breastlink of Garden Grove.<//text>

<Review>The facility was very nice, neat, and clean. The machines looked new and clean. Elsa, my tech, was very knowledgeable, gentle, sweet, and friendly. It was my first mammogram and it was not at all horrible like I had anticipated it to be. It was quick and easy. I would definitely recommend this clinic and highly recommend Elsa!< /Review><user>109208499355741715268</user>< Resp>

I was well pleased by the radiologist or Mamogramoligist!! She seemed very understanding of how I felt throughout the process. I just learned today that while they have a protective device to help keep us safe during the cancer causing radiology I was never even offered it? I wonder now why it isn’t made as a mandatory part of the process. Thank you 🙏< /review>

<text>I was nervous to get my 1st mammogram at the age of 33. This facility went out of their way to get missing paper work from my doctor. They were all very professional and the nurse that preformed my mammogram was really friendly. She made everything go by super fast and pain less. I would go back to this place for sure.<//text>< Resp>

No manager onsite when requested so my time to set aside to get there has no value to the front desk.</text><response>None<//response><username>J OPT< /username>< pics>

I went at an earlier time so it wasn’t packed at all and it was easy to find parking. Going into the place everyone was very friendly and easy to talk to. I felt very comfortable and the process of everything was quick and efficient.<//Text>

< Review>
I was nervous to get my 1st mammogram at the age of 33. This facility went out of their way to get missing paper work from my doctor. They were all very professional and the nurse that preformed my mammogram was really friendly. She made everything go by super fast and pain less. I would go back to this place for sure.</Review>

A mammogram is very uncomfortable  but the office and staff were gentle and did everything  they could to make the test as easy as possible. The only complaint I have is for the verbal directions to tell new patients to go to the back of her building to park or that there is an elevator in the front. Many patients are elderly and can't walk that far or climb stairs.< /text>

The facility is dirty, messy, the changing room door is broken. The ultrasound room is stack-up with boxes on top shelf as the patient under on the table doing ultrasound. The ultrasound room window is wide open looking out to the neighborhood. There is no trash can.</text>

I have gone there twice, 1st. time for an MRI, 2nd. time for a bone scan. Both times exceeded my expectations in every way. The staff is very pleasant and considerate, the wait time was nothing. I was taken in immediately after I had done my paperwork. Having had MRIs taken before, in other supposedly upscale facilities, I can say that this place is by far a much nicer, much more pleasant and comfortable experience, thanks to the professionalism, caring, and considerate people who work there.

Great experience with techician inside. Very nice staff.

One problem at check in process. After waiting patiently for a good amount of time, another patient complained about waiting for 2 hours and I thought it was a good idea to come check. My name was marked done and 5 more patients after my name were also blacked out. If I didn’t get up and ask, I don’t know if I would ever get called. The staff said sorry and started on my paperwork. Seems like waiting patiently is not always good.</Review>

< Review>
Ultra sound tech was hard to understand. Huge language barrier. She also wasn’t listening when I spoke to her. I told her what I found in my breast and she kept repeating lump when I distinctively told her I do not feel a lump. There was also a student (I’m assuming) in there quiet the whole time and this person wasn’t introduced as a student. It was really uncomfortable. When they came back into the room the “student” was smirking as though they were laughing a second ago and then tried to stop before they came in. When the tech out the line on my chest she squirt it all over my face!!!! And then said sorry but didn’t wipe it off. When I asked for an extra towel she tossed it at me. Then, at the end, the radiologist read the test for legit 2 minutes. Then came in with my results saying it’s clear. And also adding that the ultrasound isn’t the correct imaging I should be getting and that I should’ve gotten an MRI.

Won’t ever come back here. Ever.<//Review>

I try to always I respectful of other people's time. I showed up before my requested check in time and sat in the waiting room until 30 minutes AFTER my appointment time and then in a secondary waiting room for another 30 minutes after that!!! I understand these things take time and delays are to be expected but that was way longer than it should have been. annoyed.< /review>

I have appointment at 5:00 pm today for my ultra sound. I have to drink 32oz of water an hour before my appointment, I was there on time and my bladder already full but I have to wait 30 minutes before the technician came.
I have been ultra sound every six months, the other 2 technicians always on time because they understand I had to drink 32oz of water an hour before I came and with my full bladder was uncomfortable and they didn’t want the next patient will be late.</text>

The place is very clean and the staff are all very nice. My only complaint is that over the last twenty or so years of taking mammogram, this is the first time I got some bruising and swelling. It took the lady three trys to get the angle right on my left breast. By which time my breastbone and surrounding tissues were already bruised.  I think either she is new or does not have a good grip or gentle touch. She is very nice however. My previous two years were perfect though.</review>

My primary doctor’s office didn’t send an authorization prior to my appointment, and Michelle, one of the receptionists, stayed on the phone calling multiple people for almost an hour to try and make it work. Despite the circumstances of my primary doctor’s error, Michelle went above and beyond her job. Often times, some people in the medical industry can be numb to people’s situations... Michelle proved otherwise! She’s a wonderful asset to the company.<//Review>

We had to wait for one hour while the technician took a lunch break.

I had a breast ultrasound today.
After 1 and half of waiting, i was taken into examine room by an ultrsound tech who was  unfriendly.
I simply asked a question...she became nasty telling me that she has to do her work....
She was a robot..
Heather, manager called in for mediation,
NO MORE FRIENDLIER THAN THE TECH.
This is not a nice place to get ultrasound done.< /text>

The lady who did my mammogram for me did such a horrific job. It hurt so bad, and even though I told her, she didn’t care. I have had mammograms done for the last ten year, but it never hurt this bad. Bad patient care. Other places told me step by step what was happening and what to expect. This girl did nothing. Horrible.< /Review>

I was greeted immediately and waited only a minute before being taken into the exam room for my Ultrasound.
The young lady who performed the Ultrasound was very compassionate and professional.<//text>

I would recommend this facility to any who needs to get a breast exam. I had my first exam 31 years ago at a Memorial Hospital, it was the worst. Long lines, rude, like cattle, hurt, and was told if something sn't normal we will call you within the month.

This facility I was greeted with a warm smile n a friendly hello. I requested a special dressing for the exam, they were more than happy to assist me. They were kind, courteous, and geniuses with answering all my questions. They eased my nerves by having a conversation regarding my life and situation, and share a part of themselves. I felt like a queen and left my appointment 28 minutes after I arrived, knowning I had made a few new friends.
♡♡♡♡♡
☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆  10 stars for the entire staff. Thank you !< /Text>

After 1 and half of waiting, i was taken into examine room by an ultrsound tech who was  unfriendly.
I simply asked a question...she became nasty telling me that she has to do her work....
She was a robot..
Heather, manager called in for mediation,
NO MORE FRIENDLIER THAN THE TECH.
This is not a nice place to get ultrasound done.<//Review>< gmapID>

Also, the patients came to have mammogram might be exposured their privacies in the public through the windows of the room.  Please cover the windows in the mammogram's room.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< userid>

My visit was a good experience. However, the gowns are very awkward as they don't tie at the waist. They are not made for the purpose of breast exams which makes things weird and uncomfortable.</Text>
