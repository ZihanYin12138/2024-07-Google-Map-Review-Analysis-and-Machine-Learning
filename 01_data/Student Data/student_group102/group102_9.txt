< Review>
Awesome food, and great service! We ordered the beer battered fish and chips, and the burger with bacon and grilled onions. Both were perfect.

The burger was so hot, that the juice burned my hand when I bit into it. Dining inside is available with plenty of distance between tables. Or, you can choose patio or sidewalk if you prefer to be outside. Masks must be worn unless you're sitting at your table.

If you go, ask for Nicole. She's awesome! 👌< /Review>

Local local favorite, they have all American fair and a decent beer selection. If you like sports and things like that it's great place to sneak in on Sunday as well. Obviously covered 19 is taking a toll on the ambiance because of indoor seating, however definitely a spot that is perfect to call in if you are a hotel-goer.

Simply give them a call, order some burgers and zucchini fries, and if they got wings get those too... Taking back to the hotel room and you can't go wrong.

And don't forget the truffle fries!</review>

Delicious burgers. Ordered the Disco fries, it has gravy. Reasonable prices. Don't order the Arnold palmer, it was just water with a splash off ice tea.</Review>

Love this place, been going there since they opened so kind of have an idea how the food is. Always good but always different. Order something one day and go back a few days later, order same thing and it is different. No consistency.<//text>

Great food, great atmosphere, and we were served quickly compared to other places. AND they serve Martinellis (sparkling apple cider) and from what I could tell they only used the freshest of ingredients. Our waitress was really nice and made sure we knew what they had available. Loved it!< /review>

<review>A group of 10 of us stopped by for an early lunch to celebrate a coworker. The place was relatively empty when we arrived at 11:30 but had filled up by the time we were leaving closer to 1pm. Our server was very friendly and was able to answer any questions we had. I had the burger and it was excellent and cooked to order. Things are quite pricey but on par with other similar eateries in Napa. Our group everything from a BLT wedge salad to the "fish and chips" it was all great and we had no complaints. I'll have to stop by I'm the evening sometime to try out something from the bar!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>The service is A+ here. Timely, polite, non-intrusive, and very catering to children. The food, however, leaves much to be desired. It was over priced for what you actually got (the mac and cheese was actually a good portion for the price, but was just okay). My chicken sandwich was dry and under seasoned. The condiments were sparse, and the bread was soggy. All in all, it was an over-priced average-at-best lunch.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Excellent Moscow Mules!!!! The Fried Buttermilk Chicken sandwich is just a good as it sounds. Salads change seasonally so beware if you find one you like. Indoor seating is always nice or if you find a spot at the bar; outdoor seating is also a win in the summer time or if your warm blooded like my wife (they have overhang with heaters). Waiter Chelsea & Presley are great and super friendly.The team does Customer Service on point!</review>

We love this place. My fiance and I went in for a romantic date and, while it was a bit loud, we had a great time. We started with the goat cheese spinach dip, which was awesome. I then had the pork chop. The sauce and chop were amazing and my fiance had the half chicken. The skin was crispy and the succotash it came with was so so so good! We also had the pear crisp for dessert. It was a little sweet for us but still good. The bartender was charismatic and so kind! I highly recommend this place.< /Review>

One of Napa's great spots in it's approachability, food and ambiance. The fried chicken sandwich is always amazing and their sides are all great. Add "Disco" to any of them for an extra delicious treat.

Lastly, one of the best parts about "The Rose" is that their customer service is on point, friendly and fast. That's what has kept me coming back for years.< /review>

It's hit or miss meals. My advice, is to keep it simple, and you will be fine. Other, restaurants are nearby, so don't forget to look.</Review>

<Text>Not a good happy hour experience.  Server didn't offer info on happy hour menu until AFTER we ordered from regular menu.

Stick to the basics - get a sandwich or burger. The "disco fries" are loaded with lots of sausage. The "flatiron steak" is a piece of overpriced meat with very little flavor & comes with some non-edible watercress leaves just so that the rest of the plate doesn't look completely empty. Good mac and cheese. The salads also come loaded with lots of dressing. Service is decent though.< /Text>

<review>I had the lamb burger, it was recommended by several friends at different times, and I'm so glad I did!!! It was amazing! Full of flavor & so juicy!! Drinks are overpriced, but it's Napa so that's pretty on par. We'll definitely be back!!</review>< pics>

<Text>So this place was recommended by a friend who said the food was good. I had never heard of it, even though it’s been here since the 70’s apparently. I went to check out the menu thru their website and decided to go ahead and make reservations. After filling in the required information, I clicked submit only to get the “we don’t support online reservations” message. Ok, no worries, let me call them.
Jen picked up and after a confusing conversation about me being part of a party, she said: “hold on one second”. She puts the phone down and 20 minutes  later, I hung up. She completely forgot about me. I know she put the phone down because I could hear everything that was going on and then when I tried calling back, the line was busy.
Anyways, against my better judgement, I still went ahead and showed up as planned, party of four no reservation.
We were seated immediately and our waitress (the other Jen) served us. The place is a sports bar that has wood paneling all around, tv screens everywhere and a big screen for sporting events (there was a fight happening and would start charging $10 cover charge).
Jen was very friendly, bubbly personality and fun. Service was a little on the slow side but hey, we were there with friends from out of town so we were catching up.
We ordered the calamari and the coconut shrimp as starters. I should point out that I do not like coconut but the shrimp were really good.
I had the bacon and blue burger, my partner had the shrimp tacos and our friends had the sliders and the ribs.
Everything was really tasty. The ribs fell off the bone; the burger was delicious, well made and balanced  (no onions) and the shrimp tacos where pretty good too.
Overall a good place to eat and hangout if you’re in the area.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<text>What an awesome surprise! This place was fabulous! We were told to go to several different places for a nice dinner. But, this place was right across the street from our hotel. We weren't expecting much since it looks like a normal tavern. But, we were extremely surprised by the flavors of the food. We had the roasted chicken with kale snd vegetables and it was amazing! Do yourself a favor and try their Gowan cider. It's one of the best ciders I've ever had! We went twice on our vacation and wished we had gone here a few more times instead of some fancy restaurants we tried. Great restaurant and wonderful menu!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

We walked in at 8:55 and we were told orders stop at 9, even though the table we were standing next to had the waiter just collecting their order and we said we would be fast the manager just replied “its a whole process so i am just shutting this down” in a very rude aggressive way. I guess he just didn’t like how we looked cause it didn’t make any sense especially when we could hear the table literally saying what they wanted to order< /Review>

Totally awesome. Ordered the lamb burger and a glass of wine. The burger was cooked to perfection as was the spinach. Food and wine tasted amazing. My finance is a picky gal and was blown away by the half chicken. Service was superb, even with the place packed.</Review>

Dinner was terrific. But my Bloody Mary was by far the worst I've ever had. It was hard to describe it's flavor, so unlike anything I've ever had..had a clam taste which can be good but not here, then a celery carrot taste, which over whelmed the drink.. something was floating around, could not identify this substance. It was nice and strong and loving my Vodka, l could not finish.<//review>

<Text>Norman Rose is not a high-profile foodie destination.  Great for those of us who love it because it's not mobbed with tourists.  The food is better than most of the Napa Valley foodie-magnets and is a bargain by Napa standards.  It's right downtown in walkable proximity to Oxbow, the Wine Train, and shops, bars, and tasting rooms.  I love their lamb burgers!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< user_name>

<Text>Our hostess tauted their fish and chips as the best we'll ever have and the pulled pork nachos as excellent! To our disappointment, both dishes were extremely greasy and that was after they came out late and cold and had to be sent back to be reheated. Also the nachos had a strange-tasting red sauce layered with the sauer cream but there was no guacamole! Overall not a great food experience and overpriced for quality of food we were served. Will not be returning!  P.S. I would be remiss if I don't mention that the lady serving us was very pleasant and smiled the entire time.</Text>< pics>

Norman Rose has one of my favorite happy hour offerings. Although not extensive, it's not overly focused on the house winning like so many others.
All draft brews are $5, including double and triple IPAs.
It's a great approach &it worked as a marketing tool for me as I ordered a $25 entree. Win win, it works for me!<//Text>

<text>Norman Rose has a cool atmosphere. Typically I'll go with a lamb burger but I had the duck burger the other night which was amazing. The goat cheese, spinach dip made for a tasty app while we waited for the rest of our meal to arrive.  Stop in for drinks at the bar or grab a table.< /text><UserId.>103689295971307262556< /UserId.><Date>1479936438751< /Date>< gmapID>

The flank steak was good, but I wouldn't say it's the best steak I've ever had. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, just the way I like it, but the sauce tasted quite ordinary. I also ordered the orange shortcake for dessert, but it turned out to be nothing like what I expected; it was more like a plain-tasting and rather dry muffin or scone (with whipped cream and berries)  instead of a cake. The server also forgot about our table at one point and we had to call someone to refill our water glasses. However I did have a really fantastic glass of red wine, the Magnificat by Franciscan Estate.</Review>

The atmosphere, food quality, and service all adds up to a really great experience.

Relaxed & rustic vibes, unique & delicious menu, local-restaurant freshness & quality, friendly service, and in the heart of downtown Napa -- it's a really good "taste" of Napa.

Some favorites... Fried Egg Sandwich, Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich, Tillamook Cheddar "Mac n' Cheese", Truffled Egg Salad & Smoked Salmon Toast, Truffle & Parmesan Fries, Disco Fries</Review>

Just go eat here! What do you want to know about? The huge portion of fish and chips, the bacon wrapped meatloaf and mashed potatoes with a coffee barbecue sauce! Bubbly spinach dip with tillamook cheese..I could go on and on, Frank's fritos burger yes I said fritos burger and disco fries. A great staff and awesome service!</review>

Food was overpriced and they wouldn't do separate checks for our party of 12.
5 out of 12 of us got food poisoning. Food was cold, wrong order, mac & cheese was disgusting & cold. They still charged us for the nasty late arrival of food even though it was not eaten as we had to share our food because my bro in law didn't even get his food til it was time to leave.<//Review>

Need dinner in Napa without filling out a loan application? Ready for an adult beverage at the end of the day? Make your way here and enjoy a spot where the food is good, the drinks are refreshing and the whole experience will leave you feeling like  you picked the right spot. It's popular so expect a brief wait or make for the bar and skip the queing for tables...< /review>

Wine tastings end around 5pm in Napa. If you're like me, after a day of drinking, you'll find yourself wanting meat of some kind. For this reason, Norman Rose is a clutch choice.

It's called tavern for good reason. The decor plays this part well with wood framing the inside---has a rustic and classy feeling to it. At 5:30pm on a Saturday, we were sat right away with little wait. Being a smaller venue, I could imagine it getting busy easily though. Service was very good. Our waiter was fun, had great recommendations, and the food came out fast.

We were encouraged to try the ginger beer with the lamb burger or chicken sandwich. Having went with the staff favorite chicken sandwich, I was not disappointed! The ranch sauce is superb and worked really well with the chicken---contributing to it being consumed very fast (yum!). The truffle fries were also good, but restrain yourself. Eating too much of these can spoil the whole meal. Get a side of ranch to go with it.< /text>

Our party was in the back room which was nice.  Less noise than main floor (that wasn't too noisy either) Appetizers, parmesan fries w/truffle oil were wonderful and gone very quickly. Beverages were good and main entrees tasted great.  My sons burger was a little under cooked and needed to be refired which took almost too long. By the time it came out most were finished.  He did enjoy it.   Will more than likely visit again.< /Review>

Ate or attempted to this evening.  The server first indicated that they were out of meatloaf.  I figured no problem and ordered another drink and a burger.  Then the burger came out without an egg.  That followed by a M/W burger being cooked rare.  The manager looked at me and told me to be respectful as they could all hear my frustration.  Didn't comp anything nor apologize.   If the short dark hair female manger is working I would think twice.</review>

Great casual dining in Napa.  Burgers are the best I've ever had.  Try the fried egg burger.  Pork chops are great.  Lots of other choices on the menu..  Kid friendly.  As you'd expect in Napa, good wine list as well.< /review>

<review>I have never been treated as rude as I was this past Saturday night. After the wine train we stopped in at the tavern to grab a bite to eat and drink. The place was empty so we decided to sit back and have a few rounds. After our second round the waitress came and picked up our menus and walked away. We asked her what she was doing and she informed us she was told to do that. So as business owners ourselves, we complained to the manager who came over  and smoothed thing over until this waiter (who was not our waiter and was very sloppy in appearance) came by the table and muttered something barely audible. I asked him "what did you just say?" he spun on his heals and said "it is inconsiderate to occupy a table when you are just drinking." I then responded; "it is rude to comment on things that don't concern you, we were just about to order until YOU told the girl to get our menus." I then asked for the check (which was well over a hundred dollars) it was not like we were not paying patrons and what went from a good time was ruined by this complete idiot. The manager attempted to smooth thing over but we were done. What was over a hundred dollar bill probably would have been over three hundred by the time we were done eating. Instead, we will never step foot in that place again with rude employees. Beware.</review>< Date>

<review>There's an element of flare in every dish - the chicken salad with pear and blue cheese is a great lunch option, while the $20 steak is one of the best you'll find anywhere. Norman Rose has become a reliable regular haunt for me every time I'm in Napa.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Terrible service. The vegetable soup we ordered was cold with very few vegetables. The waiter was slow with our order and did not check on us very often. In addition, the food portions were not equal among tables. For example, the table next to us got three scoops of ice cream on their apple cranberry tart, while we only got one scoop (the table next to us did not ask for extra ice cream). Also, we were sitting near the bar watching the baseball game after paying for our meal when the manager came over and asked us to leave because he wanted to give the table to someone else. The manager was rude, sarcastic, and insensitive. I have never seen a manager ask a paying customer to leave the restaurant, especially when a postseason baseball game is on. We will not be going back to Norman Rose.< /text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The hamburger was delicious, but the salty potatoes and the exquisite BLT salad were also delicious.
The burger is also delicious!

His attention to detail, and his patience is unmatched. His service felt natural and genuine. I can tell without a doubt that he does his best with every customer he meets. Not only did he help me with my new phone, he also ensured my family was getting the best out of their plan. Thank you thank you for your hard work!

<text>A young employee by the name of Tony has impeccable talent. He helped 6 or 7 customers on his own with an hour and a half to spare before closing. He was poised through it all. His multi-tasking skills were incredible. He was completing transactions on 2 iPads, checking inventory, and answering questions. The guy was a machine no lie!! He was outgoing — having conversations and cracking jokes with the customers, which took the edge off everyone who seemed in a rush. Never had a customer service experience like that ever! Thanks again to the goat Tony! Sheeeeessh!< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dd33d733856591:0x5da242a582c37651< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I came across a few issues trying to get new services online. I called support and got the run around a few times.  I ended up calling a local store and Jamie was very easy going and gave out good info. I ended up going to the store to make my purchase. Jamie was able to resolve my issues and get me signed up. Great customer service skills, friendly and professional! I recommend going to see him...< /Review>< Pics>

It would be nicer if they had real phones to show and not just fake phones. Other than that, great costumer service.< /text>

We came into AT&T store to upgrade our phones. Anna was a great help!! She had very good customer  service skills. She was very informative, full of information and very patient with us. She answered all our questions and remained professional. We couldn’t decide on how to upgrade, did a lot of back and forth, but Anna never lost her cool, stayed composed and tolerated us. Thanks again for all your help, Anna!</text>

Quite possibly the smoothest experience when upgrading my phone. Jaime is the best and he really made it easy and cut through the non sense. Bypass the vultures and beeline to him.<//review>

I walked into this store with the idea of simply looking at phones for a potential upgrade in the future.  Within seconds of walking in I was greeted at the door by a gentleman Saul. Saul was very patient with me as I looked around, answering all my questions and providing me with all the information needed for an upgrade. I decided to upgrade my phone and somehow ended up with a tablet (how could you say no when its FREE). I upgraded at that time because I saw how attentive this rep was.  I was offered a variety of accessories with the devices I was looking at which would make this upgrade easier than me having to look on my own. After some conversation I later discovered that I could actually get Direct TV at this location along with other home services all at a discounted rate for simply being an AT&T customer. Long story short. I walked out of this store very satisfied. I upgraded my phone had a very cute case to go with it both devices. Not to mention I had a whole new TV provider which I am in love with! Direct TV and AT&T have my recommendation! Thank you Saul for all your help!<//review>

I honestly was considering switching services until I came here. There was one woman in particular who helped me named Miriam & she changed my mind. Her service was the best & she was super patient & knew what she was talking about! Needless to say I would have left if it wasn’t for her ! Thanks again !< /Review>

In & out, loved it, first time at an at&t store where I didn't have to wait foever for service and there was only one rep present and a couple of other clients. Maybe it was the fact that it would be closing in roughly 45 minutes. Don't really know or care, can always appreciate efficiency at its best!</Review>

<Review>Lazy ass customers service.  They won't help me with transferring all of stuff from old phone to new phone,  what they going to do at the AT&T store and do nothing to all is they disrespect to customers and they were on their cell phone whole time they working and getting paid for sitting and been on phone all day and not help customer and wasting customer's time and do not go there because they can't help your problem with your phone. They only help when you planning to buy new phone or have time to help out!     The at&t will need to do something to check in this place and tell them to help out and be more respectful to customers who need and don't know any better with phone.  Why do you get that JOB if you don't care about your job to help customers then you shouldn't have been working there!!   Damn AT&T!< /Review>< pics>

Well, its 10am on a Saturday and store is still closed. Been having bill issues with ATT for 3 months now and now this. Every time I come in to the store there is always just one store attendant. Adios ATT, first and LAST phone contract with them.<//text>

Just standing inside this location was uncomfortable. The representatives show little to no concern about the issues being addressed and were just lounging around watching television staring blankly at one another and browsining their phones. No enthusiasm, No smiles, Horrible customer service. 4 representatives and not one carried themselves professionally. There wasn't even a warm greeting as you arrived, these gentlemen looked miserable.<//Text><Rating>1<//Rating><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<rate>1< /rate><text>This is not my first unpleasant experience with this store.  Last time I upgraded my there wsre issues.  Not to mention the place stinks when you walk inside.  This is not an AT&T corporate store.  I learned the hard way to go thru corporate stores only.  Apparently, as a franchise they do what they want.  The employees aren't the issue rather the stores management.  The assistant manager (horrible service skills) and manager (admittedly said they were wrong ) refused to honor an employee's offer of $300 for a trade-in on a cell phone. Despite the hassles and waste of my time/ energy, AT&T recognized that we have been loyal customers for 10+ years.  The rep at corporate exceeded my expectations and not because of the items she compensated me.  But, rather she diffused the situation, calmed me down and addressed my concerns.  She was amazing but the store totally sucks.  I will drive out of my way to another store from now on rather than shop here.</text>< userid>

<Text>Staffing issues I'm sure. I was the only one waiting and I waited for over 45 minutes and had to leave without any help. Staff was apologetic, but they were with the same guests the entire time I waited. Horrible Horrible Horrible. Went to Verizon, waited 3 minutes and facility was busy.< /Text></record>

<review>I have had various storage units at 21st & R since the mid to late 80's. The staff have changed over the 35 years, but every single staff member has been courteous and helpful.
The fact that the units are inside a concrete building and remain cool on the hottest days is great if you're storing heat sensitive items.< /review>< Pics>

<text>A buddy of mine had rented a unit and stored a vehicle here and recommended I check them out if I ever needed a storage unit. My wife and I rented a couple units last fall as we transitioned from one home to another. The process of securing the units was swift and painless, and the facilities were clean and easy to navigate. I like some of the quirky bits that are tied to the age of the building, like the freight elevator. Made trips to unload/load a little easier as the kids got a kick out of riding the elevator. The location is great too for a treat downtown after making runs.

Pleasant staff and the manager was very helpful, especially when opening and closing our account. He even gave us a courtesy call to remind us of the last day approaching so we could ensure we were out of the units in time and avoid fees. If I ever needed a storage again, this is the first place I would think of.</text>< Gmap_id>

Found I moved too many things. Looked for local storage to Mid-Town Sacramento and this place is perfectly located! The website was everything a website should be, can get everything done online with one visit. Even visited and the facility is perfectly located, great hours and has supporting parking and moving equipment. With moving being challenging, this is a perfect “no-worry” partner.<//Review>

21st and R was a good experience. The building is well monitored and maintained. Signup and close-out were quick and easy. Andy, store manager, straightened out an issue I had related to prorating my final payment; he was really a great dude. Highly recommend this place.</text>

They have like 5 levels of storage and indoor, temperature controlled units. Back a truck up to the loading deck. The higher deck trucks work better than uhauls for this place loading and unloading from the decks. They provide quite a few 5-6ft long and 3-4ft wide push carts to hurry things along.<//text>

Self storage for all of your storage needs! The staff at 21st and R Self Storage are  absolutely amazing! Not only did they help me find my unit help me load and unload items as well! They even helped to guide my daughter-in- law to back the truck up to the loading dock. And because I'm a girl and I've not got much experience they helped me to strap down my load as well! :-) I would highly recommend 21st and R they are great!< /review>

Facility is secure, clean, and accessible.  Never had a hard time accessing my things for the two years I stored things.  The hours are good, the clerks/managers are friendly and knowledgeable,   Parking lot is good, availability of carts terrific.  Would HIGHLY recommend this place for peace of mind with your items in storage.</text>

Great Experience here. Andy was more than helpful. He was professional, thorough, and patient as we toured the facility, and answered all my questions. He was also great at helping me choose the right sized space. Great building, great location, great staff. Highly recommended.< /Review>

< Review>
I was treated with respect, courtesy, and professionalism. Being a longhaired, gypsy headband wearing man, I am so, not used to this very refreshing and friendly treatment! I have run companies and managed several others, and most always had to deal with the disrespectful, closed minded attitudes of people above and below my positions. This place made me feel right at home. I would have went the full Five Stars, but, in all honesty, I find the hours completely contradictory to an establishment, that I believe, chooses to accommodate it's clientele completely and with earned satisfaction. The Eight am in the morning opening, seems to show a lack of motivation toward us busy, early morning individuals. Otherwise Great Place

<Text>We needed to find monthly storage as our daughter was moving out of shared rental and couldn't move into new apartment for a couple of weeks. We called 21st and R as they are close to new apartment and have good reviews.  We wanted to be sure we had something set up before her move out date. In talking to their customer service they were very helpful explaining how to reserve a space and the costs. We went ahead of time to check out the place- it is looks secure and clean. Andy got our information so when it was time to rent/move in our belongings it was very easy. We highly recommend checking them out!< /Text>< pictures>

<review>In general my experience with your storage facility was good and the facility was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful.  However, on the day I moved out (Jan 28), the elevator stopped working due to scheduled repair work.  It would have been helpful knowing this before I had my cart loaded and sitting in the elevator on the 5th floor on an elevator that was no longer running.  I was told that the elevator would be out for 30 minutes but after leaving and coming back, I was told it was still being worked on so I unloaded my cart.  A staff member did call me back an hour later to tell me the elevator was running, so this was a plus.   Perhaps sending out an opt-in text message when the elevator is down might be helpful in this situation.   I do recommend this facility if you're in or near mid-town.<//review><pics>None<//pics><gmap_id>0x809ad0e71021e867:0x9f3d8b5244924d75<//gmap_id><user>108501530838351389451<//user>< Resp>

<Text>My experience at the 21st& R Street Storage Pro facility has been an excellent one.  The manager Henry and his staff, Andy & Monroe, all assisted me throughout the chore of moving & consolidating, all the while making it much more pleasant experience with their knowledgeable, kind and considerate ways.  Every step of the way I was impressed with their customer service.  I feel that my belongings will be safe & secure with this crew's attention to detail.  Thanks so much!!!

Performance:
Fantastic!!   When I needed more storage space to sort my belongings for consolidation, I was suggested ideas & accommodated on the same floor as well as provided with a generous deal on the cost.  Between the drinking water, moving supplies and the overall terrific customer service, I will remain a customer for some time.</Text>< Pics>

This was a great place that I used for over two years. I always felt safe there and I liked that it wasn't an outdoor storage where people had access 24 hours a day. If I had any complaint at all, it would be that I came in when they were doing a special and got a screaming deal. Since then, I got another unit that was double the price because I had gotten it later (outside of promotion), but then every year I got an increase on my storage rate as well. All in all, it was a good experience and I paid a year in advance, so when it was time to get out of the storage business, they made it very easy for me to get the portion of unused rent back on the units. I would be happy to refer them to anyone, but I hope I don't have to get a storage unit any time soon!< /text>

Storage Pro is an excellent storage facility!  I have had a storage unit for 12 years and I am extremely pleased, not only with the facility and the security it provides but also with the very friendly, extremely helpful and accommodating staff. It's always a good thing to do business with people you genuinely like. Henry, Munroe, and Tim are the sweetest guys! If you're looking for the absolute best storage facility in Sacramento, [IMHO] 21st & R is the place.  PAW</Text>

Great service and Staff and decent pricing on units Ideal for long-term storage needs! Not a "maze" of cubicle type lockers where you drive about looking for unit!  I also rented a Public Mail Box (PMB) from the same location, very convenient! The huge Silo style heavy lift is a god-sent you can load as much s you dare and reduce the number of trips from your car, truck, van.   I have rented here for about 2 years now and I have only 1 increase in rent for storage!< /review>

I have been renting a unit from storagePRO for a year now. My experience with them has been amazing. They are very customer service orientated. They always find a way to work with you and tailor to all of your needs. The price is very affordable and the location is conveniently in mid-town. I couldn’t ask for any more.</text>

<userid>111797651969517464104< /userid><review>The staff is SUPER friendly here and willing to accommodate your needs the best way possible.  The facilities are indoor with a large freight elevator- and it can hold A LOT.  The freight elevator definitely makes the experience unique, and the staff shows how it is operated.  There are big rolling carts for moving your things from parking lot to your storage space- which may be located on one of several floors.  The facility is centrally located downtown with a large parking lot area and ramp.  Next door, you can drop off old computers, tv's, etc for recycling- which I have found to be convenient on several occasions.  The hours are typical business hours, so you have to keep that in mind: it is not open 24/7.  The facility is located in my neighborhood- which makes it especially convenient and ideal for me.< /review><username>Jennifer Foxley< /username>< rate>

<review>Whoever run this company is unprofessional and rude. I am an owner of one  the property they used to manage and i ask them to provide me with with docs of my property. I talked to a person who seems to be the owner and he was rude, disrespectful with aggressive language. I was calm and trying to understand what i need to do in order to get docs of my property prior I bought where at that time they have to be managed by them. Do not deal with such people they dont care about you as much as they care abut getting their %

when a person who suppose to deal with tenants and landlord telling you " i don't want to hear your crab" when you are asking a normal question on how can i get the docs... then you can tell how professional they are!< /review>< pics>

Our property management lead, Leon, says what he means and means what he says. He's been reliable and up front with us on expectations throughout the process. He does not over-promise; he delivers upon his promises.  No organization is perfect; we did have one repair from a third-party vendor double-invoiced, but APM ratified the error, quickly.  It's the response to adversity that's more important than untested promises, and APM came through.  We can't in good faith give higher than a four Star review because we have no other property management company experience with which to compare to APM; thus far, we're not looking to replace APM.  APM is performing above expectations.< /Text>

We switched to APM because we lost confidence with our previous property manager. Not only that APM offered better pricing, they were the only company who answered the call immediately when we called. We spoke to the broker and were assured that they would be able to assist us with an ongoing mold issue. The transition was smooth and the maintenance staff has been very helpful. Thank you.< /Text>

< review>
This property management have a whole list for you to get things done before moving out. Some of their checklist includes things that need to have professionally done for example like a drape/curtain that you never use and kept on storage and getting  carpet cleaned when it was never cleaned before moving in. They make you do all these cleaning and you have to pay out of your own pocket to get the place clean. They even mention about painting the walls! I know some places own by them and the house have holes, patches , cracks they don’t even fix it so the people that’s moving in is basically have to do extra cleaning themself. This just upsets me because one of my friend is renting from the management and to me I feel like they try to scam you to do things for them when it should be their problem to do it!<//review>

< Review>
They took care of our property, 212 union city for over an year. My husband and I are very pleased with their services.
We found them to be reasonable, trustworthy and honest.
Their fee wasn't the lowest and we were enticed by few other PMgr's but these guys have our trust.
We finally decided to sell the property and they were professional about it. No hassles at all.<//Review>

APM deserves 6 stars. I was referred to them by my real estate agent after I was frustrated with my previous property manager who failed to properly respond to my questions and concerns about the new rental law. Leon is very knowledgeable with the laws and he answered all the questions I had in 1 phone call. You don’t have to take my words for it. Give them a call and you will find out. I was sold after Leon was able to address all my questions that I was concerned with but never got straight answers from my previous property manager. My agent has referred clients to APM for 30 years and said that they are the property management company which many real estate agents in the area referred their clients to.</review>

I am an owner and was really unhappy with what happened recently my place was rented for 18 months when I told them in emails for one year and even the amount for the rent didn’t go up to what I said in the email it was totally ignored. I don’t like to rent my place for more than a year at a time especially when I told them early on I was thinking about selling it. Not knowing when you sign a property management agreement that they have the right to do whatever they want with the lease or the amount because you’re given them permission and I didn’t see it until after I signed the property management agreement the amounts with the 18 month lease.  So if you’re an owner and thinking about going to this company you better make dang sure about the amounts and what the lease is before you sign anything. They have agreed to take a hit on the rent for the next 18 months out of their maintenance fees but I’m still unhappy with 18 months and the whole thing. I was told the other guy that did it has a lot of rentals well then he should be doing a different job if he’s not paying attention.<//text>

This is my second property management company. Unlike my first management company, I really like and appreciate the works they did for me as the owner of the house. They listen to me and provide very useful information to me whenever I got questions. The team has demonstrated the highest professional standard in answering calls, responding to emails etc..
I recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a property management company to take care of their rental houses.
Keep up the good job!!</Text>

<Text>If I could give 0 stars I totally would let me explain why. I already tried renting two great and affordable homes here and both those times affordable property management take down their application for that certain home when I clearly told them I will apply tomorrow in the morning and the secretary approve and said they haven't received many applications. I was so interested in this home I could provide my family with but once I was ready to apply the listing was gone so I call their office and a man answers saying that they have too many applications in and that was the reason they took down their listing. I am really upset with this management and how they handled my situation. would not reccomemnd.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This is the worst agency that I ever seen in my life. The staffs are rude and unqualified and they are just a bunch scammers whom charge people for their credit report in order to rent the property for them, but they come up with stupid excuses which don't make any sense at all! I wish I could give negative stars to this crazy agency with their dump employers who are a bunch of crooks and waste timers.<//Review>< name>

If your looking for a new place to settle with family look no further. APM’s application process, approval, and sign of lease was very smooth and hassle-free. Each and every time I have issues in our townhouse we’re renting the response is within 24 hours and they try to fix the issues ASAP. That’s what I like most about. They are also transparent and clear about the terms and conditions of the lease. I would definitely recommend APM.</Text>

APM services always have an excellent services in every area of their work. I have been a client for the past 7 years. I never had any issues at all. Staffs are courteous, very professional and go an extra mile. It's hard to find a business you can trust. APM is a rare breed that you can trust and so I can sleep well at night.<//text>

< review>
Laraine is probably one of the most rude people I have ever talked to over the phone regarding a property. I never leave reviews  even if I have a bad experience. I called in to ask a couple of questions and moving in time frame and she got all short and had a very RUDE tone. Why would you want to have someone like that as your property manager? You're supposed to sound welcoming and make people want to live at your property not keep them away from it. Work on your people skills and maybe you won't have so many complaints. Or just get a new person to answer the phone that will treat everyone with respect and not cut off you off on every sentence. Good luck.</review>

This is a money grabber place. Although they checked our credit score last Thursday, they asked this morning to check the credit reports for my adults kids, and a couple hours later they refused our application. Thats very stupid because they knowingly took our money.

Please stay away from this place worst place in Fremont.

Always responsive, very fair with service requests. Sometimes could do a bit better with follow through after a service request, but not really a big deal.<//Review>

<Review>Affordable Property Manage is a processional company that is customer centric.  Properties for rent are fully descripted in lisitngs and the rental process is through but not overbearing.  The rental contract is reviewed with the tenant and service requests are handled in a timely manner.  All communications are cordial and we are kept informed owner and managelment needs.
I highly recommend Affordable to my friends and family< /Review>< time>

<review>They don't want you to see certain units and this is because they are old and outdated. Windows that barely open and walls so thin you can hear the neighbors TV, bathroom, baby crying and other things, they never fix what they say, said they would replace old window coverings instead had someone come clean them and they broke them up because they were old . stone with no knobs, no screen door, they are horrible and don't follow or enforce any rules they have you sign< /review>< Pictures>

Terrible experiences with them on multiple properties. Their office hours are very limited. In order to see a property you can’t call to schedule beyond 24 hrs, they are not available on the weekend when most people are off of work and they can only show a property between the hours of 9am to 3pm M-F when most people work. This is an inconvenience and has deterred me from working with this company in the future.<//Text>

Unpleasant staff. At first they act nice but once you are a tenant they are atrocious.  I always paid on time (auto withdrawal ). Every time I needed to discuss an issue with the depatment I was met with resistance (only about 4 times in two years). I don't understand why since I was a great tenant.

I moved out after 2 years and they want to charge for paint - $800.  I took pictures when i moved in and I hope you do too. The paint was mediocre when we moved in.

Also they want to charge $120 for two lightbulb replacements and a PLATE that I overlooked on the porch and didn't pick up.  That is an interesting charge to say the least.

Oh well never refering anyone here ever.</Text>

APM7 is one of those shops that is spoiling the Bay Area property market for all.

APM7 is using unfair means that put renters at a disadvantage. They are taking in rental applications without showing a Union City property and claiming that only if the property is not rented by a certain date, they will setup a showing. Lazy or smart? Trying to create an artificial glut and trying to take advantage of renters situation.</review>

I lived in a property that they managed for two years, and spent the last year of that waiting for them to fix my refrigerator while continually being billed for furniture removal in the garage that was there when I moved in, thermostat adjustment on a thermostat that they had replaced AFTER they received a bill for an adjustment, among a hoard of other things that were never fixed or fixed properly. It took months for anything to get done, and a couple times I had to hire an attorney so that Leon would stop harassing me and sending me frivolous bills.< /review></record>

<Review>The guy Leon made me feel worse about about my stupid tenant situation than it was,. I have to take care of this stupid tenant thing in my own, all I wanted was a custom property management plan from this company and it wasn't going to happen to help me talk to the stupid tenant when I arrive in town on 4/27,.  I have a bad vibe now about property management companies in general and I have to take care of this tenant on my Union City property 420 miles away, ridiculous, stupid, and a waste of a conversation</Review>< pics>

<text>Seriously, go to this location.  The manager, Debbie, is awesome.  They match discounts, they have some great deals, and management lives on property, so there's always someone there to watch who comes and goes, even after hours.  The storage units are clean, and all staff are great.  No complaints.<//text><username>Lauren McDowell<//username><response>None</response><pics>None< /pics></record>

<Text>The management and staff before was fantastic. They always had a smile on their face, welcoming and you can tell they really meant it. The management now, is an awful person in general and not an honest welcome and they staff seems very uneasy. It feels like a cemetery there. It's a storage facility not a boot camp. My son is 11years old and really really needed to use the restroom. He ask they said, "NO!" Like if he was going to take the toilet seat or walls. I was dissatisfied. Management there now makes it very difficult and not at all courtesy. I used to buy Starbucks and bring lunch to Debbie, Lethicia and their staff that manage it before just because and management now I can careless if they starve. Mean I know but true...<//Text></record>

This was a delicious food truck serving some Mexican and Guatemalan food staples that I got a burrito from a few times.  The food was delicious, and I ate at there provided picnic tables when I was living in the area.  I’m not sure if it still there, but if it is, I recommend there burritos.  Scrumptious and delicious.< /Text>

I live nearby and walk everyday it was a good food just bad service . If you are reading this how many people did you intend to forget and assume that the change is yours!! . Make sure that when you buy ask for your change. A "change is a change"dont assume and pocket it. A tip is something earned not presumed given .<//Review>

Beer bar, plain and simple. I don't drink, but what I like about the place that it has major potential to be a jumping club for metal and punk music, original metal and pick music. Club is small and rectangular in space with the stage sitting far back of the club. Some sitting booths on the right with the bar in your immediate left when you enter.
It's gritty and Rae looking place. Reminds me of the old Vex or even CBGB's; that gritty. It has an old school charm that has potential to be long lasting club long after it's standing 5 year existence.
Sound was good, balanced and loud. The distinction of the instruments was only limited by the musicians stage volume. The equipment staging area is right next to the club outside. It's for the bands and people who smoke or just want to get outside for a bit. Get some fresh air you won't because that place is a big ole cloud of smoke. So, if you have any issues with that, be forewarned.
Overall I'd go there again and support this place. There are not that many metal clubs around and this one is right in the old neighborhood I use to request when younger. One of the places id least expect to find a metal club.</Text>

What a cool club. My band played here from Ashland Oregon and we were treated great. We got paid, we met really cool people and our band was appreciated. Dirty Ed is the best! Much love from Bloody F. Mess and Divine Dirt!</text>

<review>Dave Travis took everything that was good about the Redwood and turned it into a paradise for the unsung musical heroes of the LA scene.  Leaving behind the drama and the cliques that now rule the dtla scene, NELA is a breath of fresh air for any and all bands who are looking to either cut their teeth or sharpen them.<//review>< user_id>

A bit grungy and dirty, but if you like the music on stage - punk, noise, out-jazz, plain 'ol weird stuff - you'll love the vibe and decor. Or lack thereof.

If you frequented Mr. T's Bowl in Highland Park in the 90s you'll notice that this has a similar vibe and has a lot of the same bands and people from that scene still hanging about. If you miss the old days when HLP wasn't all fancified, you'll love this little punk rock outpost in nearby Cypress Park. A great addition to NE Los Angeles!< /review><response>None<//response></record>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Great place to shop for food if you're really on a tight budget. They have a very large variety of many different foods and drinks. I get almost all my food items from the store besides meat. And by meet I mean steaks , ground beef. Only because I prefer a little bit higher quality when it comes to those. A chicken however is just fine and definitely recommend getting it here cheaper.<//review>< pics>

I've spoken to staff about this several times and all they can say is they dont mind.

I have noticed that food4less produce is getting horrible.  The bell peppers was so bad that they should put in trash but, they still try to get 68cents from the customer. No shame.<//review>

<Review>They have great produce, merchandise and prices. Unfortunately during my trip there an employee at the cash register got me sick. His eyes were very red and he was coughing and sneezing constantly. He handled my change that he returned to me and I must have touched my face by mistake because now I have whatever he passed along to me. I am disappointed in Food 4 Less for allowing their sick employees deal with customers or come to work in general for that matter.< /Review>< GmapID>

Looks like a Sam's Club or Costco, but low prices.  They usually have longer lines because there are less cashiers, but saving money from low food prices is always nice.<//text>

Typically we spend half as much here as we would at a Vons or Ralphs which is huge when you're strapped for cash. Produce can be hit or miss but I can't complain too much as recently we've had similar issues at the local Ralphs.

The store is as cleaner than you'd expect for a discount grocery store, and the shelves are always stocked.< /Review>

< Review>
Took a drift trip with Tom Page on the Yuba above Marysville. Weather was horrible, cold rain and hail that was hardest I have ever fished in. Tom was great got us on some fish in horrible conditions and rowed upstream to do a drift again more times than I thought he needed to to make us happy.

Great guiding and hard worker. Will definitely go again with him.<//Review>

<text>Tom's shop, The Reel Angler, has everything you need for fly fishing the local waters around Grass Valley and then some. The best part is their customer service and their overwhelming knowledge and willingness to share it with the expert or novice walking through the door. Growing up in a fly shop and working in the industry for over 30 years I either love fly shops or leave them. I can say confidently I will be coming back and sending others here. They also have a great guide team and fish for all kinds of species.</text><userid>116001575092957465312<//userid><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1pAEiwSgw9vB7v__RMc09pEKIKJG8oV3pxIC7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNw4RNbpRhhhxMdYmAyoCHH1xFG16fMmO-svmt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV7xE39f7VTwVHPW9HMXlYHTepb2zXXaCIsTsI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAzSkPEtyGAnrmUYqMTMoPhX-9tARFd02bh9Z4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ_GtRvXNYJ4WKz2OJZB1TKt-tq12NAsUP7Pkw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMznFywfUqLkq5NpNy-5gFKjforFpHEhBIYk6Ri=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><date>1564539318122<//date><Response>None< /Response>< rating>

A nice clean, up-to-date shop with a very gracious and knowledgeable staff. A very important fly shop if you are fishing the Lower Yuba River. The only place to get "Yuba River Pinkies"...< /review>

Don’t go here ! Very bad service especially the doctor I work in the medical field and for him to tell me I needed to get Labs, Injections, and Medicines to be done all in the office or nothing. Trying to steal your money ! I have insurance so there is no need for me pay for everything and plus for the reason I was going didn’t even require all extra stuff only reason I was there it was late and couldn’t see PCP that day. So he didn’t even let me choose or talk what I wanted to be done. He will cut you off and tell you all mad its Everything or nothing and walks out on you.
DONT GET FOOL FOR 20$ consult
And the rude staff don’t even know what they doing. I should of read the reviews before stepping into the office. They are a rip off!< /review>

The only problem is the wait it is very long and unorganized, but I recommend it. If they can change the wait time then it can be much better. The medication helps a lot as well.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< UserId.>

Doesn't even deserve one star to be honest. Dr. Sweeney is among one of rudest people I've encountered to date. Won't ask how medication is working, how it's effecting me daily. Clearly only cares about pumping out the same prescription everyone seems to be getting..curious (Venlafaxine) Guaranteed I won't be returning, don't bother unless you want to wait for half a day for horrible service.< /review>

<Text>The doctor a fraud he lives off of the ignorance of the Hispanic people and he has clearly capitalized on it, I had to wait exactly 2 hours everytime I visited this clinic wich was a total of 3 times. I went in with a physical trauma to an interior part of my body that was causing me a blood infection and high blood pressure among other issues such as anxiety. This doctor took as much money from me as I possibly allowed him too! He never diagnosed me correctly and I know because I was diagnosed by global medical on Bristol st that's how I put this thief to the test using all his sales and scare tactics to keep me on his medication and blood test with no positive results! This place should be closed down and his license revoked!!!<//Text>< pictures>

This is the worse clinic I have ever been too. I do not recommend it to anyone. The doctor is so unprofessional, completely rude and has a habit of kicking the patients out with any due consideration. If there were a way to revoke his license that would be a great thing for this city! He should not be considered a doctor. If I could out 0 starts to this review I would.</Review>

<Text>By far the BEST office in town !! :)  I looked around even went to TJ, that was a waste of time & money . I should of have came here from the start. The staff is very helpful & friendly. Dr. R. Sweeny is AMAZING !
He made me feel so comfortable. Yet I felt I was treated like family their concern for my well-being was genuine. I would go back in a heart beat if any sickness comes back since their prices are accommodating .< /Text>< Rating>

I was seen today by a dr sweeney. I waited 3 hours patiently. My work insurance hasn't kicked in and with a UTI, I couldnt wait to see a doc. When the doc came in the room, he asked me about my symptoms and if I suffered from anxiety and trying to dismiss the reason I was there, like, First off, that's not why I'm here....he started saying he didnt believe I had a UTI but he would give me antibiotics.  The MA came into the room to tell me what he was prescribing and I asked why I needed 2 shots of rocephin along with oral antibiotics.  I told her that was unnecessary. It's either one or the other. She went and told the doc I was refusing treatment and he came storming into the room saying that I  could not pick and choose what medication i wanted. That i had to take all or nothing. I stated I couldnt afford all the meds he was recommending and he stated "I'm not here to resolve your financial situation and that's not my problem." I told him I was not gonna take anything that was not necessary and I walked out. Please dont go there, if you dont have insurance.  There are other options. This doctor and his clinic are just ripping people off and stripping them away of their dignity and  charging them for services they dont need.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Worst clinic ever! I when in for consultation due to the fact i had asthma, i saw the doctor and agree to get injections and neb treatment. I ask the "MA" for a prescription for the meds she stated "that they dont give prescription since they sell medication at their office, that if i want a prescription i have to come back and talk to the owner of the clinic a male doctor name sweeny" (whos is not even in town) So basically they force ppl to take the treatment at their office. All they care about is MONEY! Every other clinic ive been to they give prescription, they never denied a prescription to a PATIENT. This is the first and last time i come here, never going back! I dont RECOMMEND this clinic, if i could give a zero star i would.<//Review>

Honestly this is by far the worst I’ve been treated at a clinic. The doctor I think his name is Swenny was extremely rude and disrespectful I don’t know how someone can treat his patients with such disrespect. He is just something else.

(Translated by Google) The worst doctor, I don't know how people go with him. It has no respect for you. If a patient is ill, it is to be cared for and given good service. Nurses not to mention, they are always in a bad mood.

(Original)
El peor doctor, yo no se como la gente va con el. No tiene respeto hacia uno. Si un paciente va enfermo es para que lo atiendan y le brinden un buen servicio. Las enfermeras ni se diga,  siempre andan de mal humor.< /review>

(Translated by Google) All 6 months I've been with Roy has been a lie. You went for stomach pain and the only thing he did was steal me, he did my blood test and everything was normal. Then he gave me VENLAFAXIN and ALPRAZOLAM medication that would help me according to that. Well, lie never relieved my pain. I went with another doctor that if I speak with the truth and help me with my problem. BE CAREFUL THIS DOCTOR GIVES YOU DRUGS FOR ANY PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE

I scrub my health more because those medications ruin the sexual desire and many things more ... continue like this and you can win a lawsuit ... because it improved from the bad that they gave me their pinches treatments .. I am ... when I came with my wife was very kind .. asta jokes asia. When he came in he only treated me like anybody ... and he scolded me once ... And he did not even listen to one ... I went to another doctor and he found me the problem the first time ... And he gave me the right medicine ... get me money with so many fucking treatments

(Translated by Google) In my opinion the doctor is very nice and professional, he is always attentive to my medicine, the clinic has many patients but the wait is worth it since he got me up with the medicine that he prescribed because other doctors could not thank me. I still recommend them.

En mi opinion el doctor es muy agradable y profesional el siempre esta atento a mi medicamento ,la clinica cuenta con muchos pacientes pero la espera vale la pena ya que el me a levantado con el medicamento que me receto ya que otros doctores no pudieron hacer gracias a el sigo d pie .SE LOS RECOMIENDO.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It is the worst clinic they are thieves I went to the consultation and the doctor was very rude he ran me from his clinic and he did not give me the prescription only because I did not want to buy the most expensive medicine, with them, I asked at the pharmacy outside the cost was 3 times cheaper and he said that he will leave me and never come back, that he has little education and professionalism, I don't know how to call someone like that doctor,

<review>(Translated by Google) The service of the staff apart from the doctors is very bad, the ladies in front of them spend their time criticizing and laughing at people without any respect or professionalism. Today I had to wait 3 hours for my nephew of months to be treated at the end I had to go since they passed it at the end of the list 2 times, Miss Fernanda Soto very unprofessional and rude. Management: how is it possible to have someone like that representing your business? What a shame!!!
The doctors are very good but if this continues the clinic will be a failure.

<Review>(Translated by Google) They are a ball of thieves, they believe that they help people by charging them, $ 25.00 dollars for the consultation. And they are forced to buy the medicine they are prescribed for more than $ 100.00 dollars. And if you don't carry full money, they don't give you the recipe to buy it elsewhere like at Walmart. And they get annoyed if you ask them for the prescription, in addition to being a patient treatment, the most degrading part of the customer service staff. Please do not recommend that place is frustrating. Your service.

(Original)
Son una bola de rateros, hacen creer que ayudan a la gente cobrándoles, $25.00dollares la consulta. Y los obligan a comprarles la medicina que les recetan.por más de $100.00dollares.  Y si no llevas dinero completo, no te dan la receta para comprarla en otro lado como en Walmart.  Y se molestan si les pides la receta, además de que es un trato al paciente, de lo más denigrante por parte del personal de atención al cliente. Por favor no les recomiendo ese lugar es frustrante.

<Resp>None</Resp><text>If you’re getting a system installed, make sure they don’t mount your amplifier to your subwoofer! Blew my amp up by all the extra rattling, seems like a rookie mistake for a professional place. I won’t be going back.

Next day opened up my sub box to find this inside, 12 gauge wiring from the amp into the box and then looks like they spliced it down to 18 gauge wire for some reason? The splice was INSIDE my sub box. This was a $700 job they did by the way.< /text></record>

Went in to ask what can I do to solve a heating amp and they sold me something I could have got in amazon for $50 less. It didn't solve my problem then I was told they aren't mechanics after the fact. It's a NO REFUND policy and easy to see why. They'll help out but if you ain't paying for the help then it's not anyone's problem but yours.  They say price match but depends on who because they didnt match amazon</Text>

First off id like to say. The crew and employee's over at stereo city are all among awesome. Great service i had several questions an they were able to answer every single one. Even by telling what car i had because i didnt even know the name of it lol. Id recommend this place to anyone. They have the best prices. I walked in and in 30 minutes i left with everything installed an drove back home. I love my stereo system . cant go wrong with a pioneer. They have everything here. So your budget is your limit. Dont go home broke! At least at the end youll have a better an improved ride. Thank again ross! Stereo city is the Best in the I.E.</review>

Update. I removed the after market alarm installed by Stereo City and no more problems with my truck. Bad connections on very important pieces to the security tie in.<//text>< resp>

< Review>
I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a car alarm system. I had my car broken into overnight and I wasn't going to take another chance of being a victim of vandalism again. So I shopped around looking for a great price and fastest place to get a system installed into my car. Stereo City was my second call shopping around but should of been my first. I got my alarm system for a great price. Customer Services is very "Professional" awesome 👍😁 their estimated time of installation is one point. 5 stars from me!! So if you are looking for a alarm system, audio system or even nice rims for your car Stereo City is the place to go.. Thanks guys for your "Awesome" service.<//Review>

<review>Got the stereo installed, picked up my vehicle auto mirrors didn't work, the mic for the phone don't work.  Took it back, tried to tell me I didn't have the motor for the mirrors to pull in.  Explained they worked when I took the vehicle, called me back and said they for got to plug them back in.  The mic still doesn't work and the fact I have to keep going back really is bad business.  I'll never go back.<//review>< time>

<review>Did great work. Upgraded my stock radio on my 2019 Honda Civic LX to a touch screen with CarPlay. So worth the money. Installation looks clean and unit works great. Would definitely recommend.<//review>< Pictures>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>Customer services is average at best , products are very overpriced , installation is very sloppy , I was stuck paying for 2 12inch subs that blew out in less than a year , recently took in my Honda Accord to get a new stereo unit plus climate control through the acima lease program , turns out the climate control wouldn’t work,  now the salesman did mention that their was a possibility it wouldn’t work but he convinced me that he would try his best but after going to a dealership to get more information on the aftermarket climate control they confirmed it wouldn’t work , stereo city takes advantage of there no return policy absolutely no returns or refunds , if acima didn’t allow me to return the products back to them I would be stuck with a 1,000+ bill for a product that doesn’t work . Pay attention and ask as much questions people don’t get to excited and make the same mistakes I did< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Carlos and the whole staff are amazing. I was treated with an immense amount of respect and care! Not only did they welcome me to stay while they performed the work they provided me with an area to watch a movie with refreshments. Finally an automotive business that treats women with respect and honor! Carlos also gave me an incredible deal! Another place quoted me about $400 more for less work. Thank you James & Carlos for the excellent standard of care💜<//text>

<Text>This is the best stereo shop I've been to! Everybody in the place is KIND, RESPECTFUL and pleasure to work with. I went in there not knowing exactly what I was looking for and by the time they were done explaining all of the pros and cons on each product, I knew exactly what I wanted. Not to mention the pricing! After I bought all of my products and got home I spent a good hour trying to find a cheaper price online of everything I purchased and nothing came close. Very satisfied with Stereo City! I would reccomend this shop to anybody no matter your stereo needs.< /Text>< user>

<text>Totally satisfied with stereo city. My radio would turn on and turn off but would not stay on. I thought I needed a new radio because that’s what I was told at another place. They saved me the money of buying a new radio because it just needed to be relocated. They gave me a great price. Would recommend to everyone and anyone 10/10.</text>< date>

<username>Kendra Harter< /username><Text>After a terrible day dealing with Best Buy, I came to Stereo City out of desperation to complete an install. I spoke with Carlos and he was extremely helpful. They answered all my questions, and perfectly fixed the mess that I had been dealing with. I wish I would have come here first, as the professionalism is outstanding and the customer service shines. They were even able to fit me in same day, very understanding of my frustration with poor service elsewhere. I recommend Stereo City to anyone looking for excellent quality and great service.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Great place! I bought a radio from Best Buy and their free installation is a joke, so I came here and now I love my radio! I even came back to get my alarm installed and they gave me a discount. Everyone here is very welcoming and want to help you. Top choice whenever I need something in my car installed!<//text>

It was great. Carlos gave me a quote on an alarm and stuck to his word. The installer was very good and knowledgeable about the install. Been coming here for about 4years now. I hope they keep using quality people who really love what they do.</Text>

<Time>1561750273899< /Time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>So I first came here 3 years ago to upgrade the system in my Hyundai Elantra, as well as tint my windows.  For a very reasonable price, as well as easy financing options, these guys did an amazing job!  So good, that I referred my father in law to them, and they installed a new system in his truck, along with a back up camera, and again, excellent work and a great deal.

So after picking up my old 1980 boat on Craigslist, I took it there and consulted with Carlos C about putting in a nice system without breaking the bank, especially since the boat is nearly 40 years old, yet my wife wanted some decent music to listen to while out on the water.  And again, Carlos C and the team hooked me up with not only a great deal, but the work they did in putting in 4 speakers, with the top of the line receiver, and it sounds killer in this old boat.

I've been in this store a few times and NEVER have they tried to "hard close" me on anything.  They're very patient and understanding, and are definitely interested in earning your business.  They have my business forever.  I would definitely recommend them.< /text>< pictures>

Jesse was great help and so was his supervisor. Very knowledgeable AND (not that he had to) but the supervisor brought me over to his computer behind the counter to show me that the radio will fit and I don’t need any other parts. The fact that he said to me “I don’t want to sell you something you don’t need” meant a lot. They have just received a life long customer. Thanks again guys!< /review>< date>

< Review>
Had 2 twelves installed on my 2016 suburban.  There prices are beyond fair and they installed it quick.  The quality of the install was by far above my expectations.  I previously had a subwoofer installed on my wife's car at another local stereo shop and the wires were hanging out everywhere.  I'm so glad I found Stereo City for all my after market desires!</Review>

Went in with no knowledge of what I needed and got the best help from Flo. He found the parts I needed for my stereo and installed it in less than an hour for a really resonable price. The shop is nice, welcoming and has great customer service from all the employees. Definitely will come back if I ever need help with anything.<//text>

<Review>Great customer service! You walk in and are immediately approached. All questions and concerns were answered with no problem. Eddy helped us out with suggesting which stereo would be best and answered all our questions and made sure we were satisfied (no pressure in buying unnecessary things). The installment was fast and satisfying. We will definitely be coming back in the future.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Last Sunday I received a great deal at Stereo City on a new system. With parts, labor and installation it beat Best Buy by saving me almost $400.00. I had to go back on Tuesday to fix a small issue and I received  awesome customer service!
If you want the great customer service I received go see FRANK and let him take care of your stereo needs! You cant lose!!!!<//review></record>

<review>This shop and these guys are fantastic. They show you exactly what will work for you and is in your budget, no upsell or back door politics like the other shops around. They have knowledge on all their products and exactly what's going to work for you. This is the first shop I've gone to since moving here from San Diego and I can tell you I don't need to go to any others because I found my car audio headquarters. Thanks so much for doing it right, seems like a hard thing to find these days in this industry.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

You know I don't care what anybody else says about this place I like it.  These guys are really helpful they're cool to deal with and answered any questions I had.  There's a lot of stereo shops in San Bernardino I like this place also because it has a lot of stock of good stuff. So when I'm ready to buy something I know I can just walk in there buy what I need because they have it in stock and walk out. Even if I needed 10 of something they have it.  The place even looks way legit from the street unlike some of these other Shady shops.< /Text>

<review>Place sucks. Dudes like experience. They couldn't figure out how to fix my sub. I've had two friends go here and would keep having problems with their systems. This place is a joke. Yeah they have stuff but they don't have experience and always say their cheap stuff is the best stuff. Try the shop next to the gas station that shop is very experienced they send their guys to training every year.</review>< time>

I came in looking for a nice touchscreen stereo for my 96 integra, I told them what I was looking for, and they automatically knew my taste just from a few words of what I wanted, and they also provided multiple alternative cheaper choices. I didn’t feel like I was pressured into anything, and the employees were chill, and helpful and way more informative. They worked with me, and my budget and was able to give me a hell of an offer. If anybody out there is looking to buy a stereo online first then get it installed, honestly don’t lol , just come here, it’s a waste of time and money if you do it that way. Definitely a place for my future purchases.</text>

I've never written a review for any place but I'll make an exception for this place.I went in today for my headlights and they did a great job I finally have 2 working headlights! The service was great the staff was amazing. Ferris was a great a help from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out. I highly recommend this place to everyone and will recommend it to my friends and family ! I will definitely be going back when I need to. Thank you everyone at Stereo City for your help ! (:<//Text>

<Review>Compared to other shops nearby, Stereo City was the best in quality and price. Also there customer service was fantastic, they are very knowledgeable about the equipment and will help with the necessary materials. Would defiantly recommend this to others.</Review></record>

Incredibly high quality from service to materials used. Top of the line installers.  Ask for Ferris for a good price. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable.  Made my system sound amazing.   Will be coming back for any and all car audio needs.</Text>

First time dealing with this store. They have EXCELLENT customer service! Reasonable prices. Ferris did a great job of making sure I was taken care of. I had to get my car alarm replaced. It didn't take that long to put it in. I will be going back to get some other things done to my car.< /Text>

Thanks Frank!! I had an awesome experience here. Got a huge a deal on a system!  2 mid 12" kickers and a new JVC radio.  They're  Having a Winter special right now and after it was installed it hits so hard. Was so happy with my system I decided to do tint there too, really good price and perfect. No bubbles or weirdness, looks so clean. I really love being in my car now.  thanks!!</review>

Bad service. They were smoking inside my car while they were working on it and took to long just to use a base that costs a lot and strap it on with tape. I don't recommend this place.</text>

<Text>My car's sound system was acting up in the front right speaker, I brought my vehicle in to have them take a look at it, it turns out my whole sound system was acting up!!! They informed me of what was going on and why it was doing what it was doing. I went ahead and had them fix everything for me; i was in and out with what felt like a brand new system in no time at all. The guys even helped me set up the system for perfect quality!!! My car sounds like a concert hall and i love it!!! Thank you so much.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>I walked into the store yesterday having not purchased car stereo equipment for 30 years. I knew nothing about fair pricing or quality products. I was helped by a Salesman by the name of Flo who was very knowledgeable and helpful in making a selection and a mr. James gave me the best freaking deal ever! I went home and researched prices and these fellas will hook you up! Instead of taking advantage of the dumb guy they hook the fellow up. That's a rare thing these days and it was greatly appreciated.</Review>< gmap_id>

<review>Thank you stereo city! Went to stereo city to get a sound system in my truck, the sales people really helped me out with picking a good system out for my truck  and didn't get upset that I asked a million questions about everything. And now my truck sounds 10x Times beater. I would recommend this shop to everyone that needs anything for a car or truck! THANKS  STEREO CITY!< /review>< Rate>

<Text>Well this shop took the time to call me on my review to fix any issues I was having that's a big plus for me I've been to alot of shop and they take your cash and never call you on a bad review. They are taking the time to check my truck free of charge and taking my truck asap due to the respect they have for me I will return for any stereo needs. This shop has my respect that's why I just went back for rims and tires. Big thanks to stereo city and flow for getting me good deals good looking....<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
Highly incompetent and expensive. Went to get a new antenna. My old one worked except it wouldn't Go up or down. New antenna went up and down but doesn’t work. The charged 190 which is out of site  when everybody else is 40-60. My radio doesn't Work they tote my dash apart disconnected air conditioning hoses and gave me the car back like that and said they didn’t know what else to do.
Went to a local guy and in 15  minutes had the  radio working
Stereo City will be reported to the better business bureau. Incompetent and dishonest are the 2 words I use to describe them.< /Review>

<Name>Ivan L< /Name><UserId.>118414269650201584973</UserId.><text>I tried liking stereo city based on the amount of good reviews on here. Before I begin I first called stereo city in Pomona for an alarm and the price seemed pretty high. Then I called san Bernardino and the price was much lower by a couple hundred bucks. The alarm install went great! So I went back for a remote start on my manual transmission vehicle and was quoted $200 over the phone.
I show up to make an appointment and they charge me $80 on top of the $200 "for taxes." Thought nothing of it until the following day.. that's a high tax rate!

Anyway I drop my vehicle off for an install that was supposedly taking 3 to 4 hours. It took 6. No biggie. By the time I recieved my vehicle and was handed the keys immediately I noticed my clutch pedal was way stiffer than when I returned it earlier in the day. So two days later I bring it back.

The techs supposedly checked and double checked and insisted I was a preexisting mechanical problem.  My vehicle doesn't have that many miles to have those kinds of clutch problems. RIGHT! So I drove off and a few weeks later driving all of a sudden when I shifted gears the clutch became smooth with a weird sound everytime I depressed the clutch pedal. (Look at picture provided)

In short what these professionals did was move my alarm unit in front of the large spring on my hydraulic clutch therefore hitting against it everytime I shifted gears creating the stiff clutch feeling. After so many times of it hitting against the alarm unit it finally moved. Don't worry stereo city I'll move these units myself.

Beware of these guys. Their installers could have used some mechanical common sense when doing these types of installs which could have resulted in a damaged alarm unit. Not to mention the unit was NOT placed in an inconspicuous area that a seasoned car thief wouldn't find.

I'd give 5 stars for customer service but for an incompetent install, and sketchy tax rate, and a failure to actually look at the mechanical problem by simply getting under the steering wheel and finding what the problem was I'd advise people to look elsewhere.

It is too bad I wanted to like stereo city.<//text>< pics>

Came in looking for a sound system. James was able to help me out, show me different packages at different prices. He was able to work with my price range and I loved what he recommended. Stereo city won my business and I will be back here for any sound/electrical work. Thanks guys.< /Review>

Ferris helped me out and was really awesome and had great customer service. I Asked about maybe getting an in dash stereo and also got hooked up with a top product for a low price. Then asked about the wheels and got approved for a low payment on the spot for some WORK wheels. Overall the installation was really clean, and proper. Definitely a happy customer my car bumps hard now and will look even better with the wheels. Can't thank Ferris and the guys who installed my things enough. Would recommend if you have any doubts.< /Text>< Pictures>

They helped me with all the right materials, they plugged me in with the latest JR Audio equipment. New alarm system, new stereo, new bass, new amps etc. They showed nothing but love. I gave them prices that other stereo stores gave me, The hommies from stereo city beat the price and added in a free check up, anytime I needed it. Comfortable couches to relax on while watching a little free cable while you wait for them to finish up with your car. To top it off, they do A1 financing.

I bought a radio somewhere else and they thought I payed a bit much, so I checked the prices of all the places around. They beat everyone so I have had them install things on my new truck I thought I could live with. Electric locks and alarm, Herman Kardon speakers, Kicker, and an amp. It has been recent that I have been there.  I have another 4 way amp to get from them and Infiniti subs. They have good prices for the product and install. From good quality products to the best products. My truck is super clean install, super clean music, and super clean bass. They have a waiting area with huge couch to melt into with remote to watch TV. Clean bathroom and water dispenser. Warranty on products and install. I'm a very picky person and a pain. They treated me good and explain anything you ask.</Text>

<Review>I brought my Focus ST to have a system installed and I had JR help me. I came in asking for a lot I didnt want to lose trunk space but I wanted a sub... JR was super patient and figured the PERFECT setup I hardly lost any trunk space and it looks and sounds AMAZING!  He recommended infinity speakers and a JL subwoofer with a JL 5 channel amp and I couldn't be happier. I did the numbers and it was significantly cheaper buying it here and having it installed than buying it online and doing it myself. Everyone here is super professional and are more than willing to help. If you are looking to get any kind of upgrade I wouldn't even risk going anywhere else thanks JR !< /Review>< pictures>

Had them install door poppers, amp and sub kit, an alarm and speakers. Called them because they had good reviews and when they priced the work, the price seemed reasonable.
The work was done quick and thorough.
Thanks Stereo City!<//text>

<time>1480467716354</time><Rate>1</Rate><Text>I visited Stereo City at 596 South E Street in San Bernardino
to have my car's windows tinted. After I told the gentlemen
what car I had, he quoted me $160, then $173 after taxes. Why
so much? This is not an SUV but a sedan. I was told because it
has a lot of windows, so he justified the price. I agreed and
it got worked on.

Later that night, I approached a stop light and a car stopped
behind me. I then noticed in my rear view mirror that the
lower window was not tinted so the back window was not fully
complete.

I was totally apprehensive on going back there but I knew I
would not get treated fairly as a customer and/or get charged
additionally to get the lower back window completed.

After enough convincing from my wife, I went back and spoke to
the 1st person I saw. I told the young man I was not happy
with my tint job and would like it to be done completely.

The young man said I'll get someone to help you. He then
walked off as I sat down and patiently waited.

After an hour goes by, I walked to the counter and talked to
the 2nd person I saw. I said I talked to the 1st young man
about helping me and I've been waiting for an hour to be
helped. The 2nd person said I thought he helped you, Ok, I'll
help you.

The 2nd person seemed more compassionate to help me so I gave
him a chance and gave him my keys. He said there is a car
ahead of you and I will get you in in the next 30 minutes. I
agreed and went back over to the wait area and waited 30
minutes patiently.

After another 30 minutes go by, I walked to the 2nd man and
asked about the status of my vehicle. It was still parked and
no one brought it to the back of the shop.

At this point, I get very upset and the 3rd person steps and
the 2nd person walks away and sits at the register while
watching videos on his cell phone.

The 3rd person appears to be the manager and defends his team
outright. I told him the lower window was not tinted and I
expressed why would I be overcharged and the job not be
completely done.

I observed the back of the shop where all the cars are worked
on and noticed there is only one person working on the cars
while there are about five people standing and sitting around
up front.

The 4th person appears to be the owner and he defends the
manager outright. He wanted to get a calculator and try to
justify the price in front of me and I never felt so insulted
and disrespected.

I told him you do not have good customer service. He finally
said I was going to do it for you, but now you need to leave
my store. I got my keys and quietly left his store.

Next, I went to a professional tint shop outside of San
Bernardino, I was quoted $140 for every window on the car and
they said I made a mistake going there in the first place.
They even pointed out that my passenger front door has a gap in
the glass (tint work), so it did not fully cover the glass. He
also advised I get a refund or talk to the Better Business
Bureau.

As a business owner myself, if any of my Partners behaved in
such an unprofessional manner, which I've experienced, I would
employ a NEW team who are proud to be problem solvers and
provide excellent customer service.

This is the worst tint job and customer service I have ever
received. If you are reading this and you are someone who
expects excellent customer service, quality, and you work hard for
your dollar, I highly recommend doing business outside of San
Bernardino.

I have been going here for years and never had a bad experience. I had them put in a full system with a custom sub box years ago and still have yet to have a single problem with it. I recently stopped by to upgrade my indash and alarm and they gave me an awesome price and did a professional job. I never go anywhere else for my audio needs!<//Text>

A bit pricey, but if you talk to them they'll work with you. Ferris is a cool down to earth dude. They hooked me up with a 2 year no interest financing because of good credit. System sounds great, nicely tuned.. Also gave me a 2 year warranty, if anything goes wrong, they'll replace it. That definetly gives me peace of mind.< /Review>

Stereo City has great customer service. They do quality work here and will always fix what you are unsatisfied with. Straight up place with good prices. Best in San Bernardino for mostly all of your car needs. I have been comming here since I had my old beat up f-150 when I was 16. Now, I'm 23 and bringing in my Mercedes now. Reliable!</review>

I had an older BMW. I had my own aftermarket radio. They installed it for $65. Works fine. No complaints. The only thing with this place is that everybody is walking around and acting like an angry tough guy. They were not rude to me or anything, just while waiting I was in the store and noticed.< /Review>

Really disappointed!! At This place,I bought a complete system and was told before i paid for it that they had everthing to make it work,the day i pickup my car we had a problem my radio station not working,wrong speaker box,does not fit in my truck, and was told before i paid,that they the correct one,samething with my back up camera not working,i went a couple time to see if they can make it work,and all they say is they order my stuff,i never receive my stuff and they do not do refunds even tho i do not have the product they promised to have...😡NOT RECOMMEND!< /text>

Awesome service, great prices. Really good customer service from Top to bottom. took both of my vehicles in back to back days to get windows tinted, viper alarm installed, new stereo system and backing cameras. I also did some pricing research online and wth some other local dealers and none were better than Stereo City. I drove 30 miles out of my way just to make sure i got the job done right and of course for the great prices too. The guys delivered on all thier promises, no BS. Thanks Ferris.</Text>

<Text>Entered the store and was greated promptly by the sales staff. Asked if I could get my radio installed and they helped me out. Looked into getting tires too and they hooked me up with Stereo, Alarms, Window tint, Rims, and more all for a price of $4000 thanks to the sponsership discount. Would of been $6000 :@

Anyway sound quality was High Def Surround Sound EPIC AWESOMENESS! And I recommend them to anyone looking for great product and superior customer service!< /Text>< Response>

I received great customer service throughout my whole transaction. The prices are great and the staff was friendly. Eddy did a gread job for the most part,  there was only one problem that I had or I would have given them 5 stars.  They were quick to fix the problem with no issues, and for that I will definitely b a loyal customer.<//text>

Great customer service.  There's a thousand stereo shops on this street and none of them compare.  I went to the other shops and they weren't as willing to help.  Ferris hooked me up, wheels+tires, tint, full system and an extended warranty.  Im coming back with wifey's Aviator for more work!< /review>

Referring to the Automotive side: first they tell me I'm getting a hook up because I've been there before and instead of my clutch replacement being 1900 they will do it for 1300 since they "know me" and they promise me it should be done in about a day and a half so I took my car in on a Monday and here I am Wednesday afternoon still waiting even though I called Tuesday afternoon, the owner said I would have it Wednesday morning. Also there is also a local shop with actual certified Techs named Frank and Kits that would do it for a fraction of the price and within 8 hours, bottom line don't come hear save your money and if you need mechanical help on foreign cars go to Frank and Kits instead certified techs and way low prices then you will ever get in this dump.<//Text>

These guys are a bunch of CROOKS!! They have an incompetent sales staff and there installers are far from professional and these jokers are the worst people I've ever dealt with in my entire life! I'm surprised these idiots are even in business at all with the amount of past customers I'm sure they have wronged and pissed off to the point of not even wanting to deal with them anymore! You're better off doing the job yourself and finding equipment online then going to these Bafoons!<//text>

Came in today to purchase some name brand 4 gauge wiring & the man Eddie hooked me up with 4 gauge jl audio wiring for a awesome price man. I can't be happier with their service. I give place a 5 star rating for helping me out on making the rite selection.</Text>

Shady and unprofessional. Had "extra parts to my car" after a botched install. Now it's costing me $480 to get part repaired by the dealership.

***UPDATE:
Nope 👎🏽 and ur installer still has a piece of my car. The dealership found missing and broken pieces and wires cut where he disassembled it and almost caused my car to catch fire 🔥 had they not found it in time. The only one that's lucky here is you for making $280 off me for a poor install.< /review>

If I can give negative stars I would give them -5
Bad customer service.  No professionalism.  I was treated like one of their "homies" instead of a paying customer.  Went for window tint and they told me I had to wait a day because their tint guy wasn't In that day, so I came the next day and turns out I had to come again in the next day. You better believe I was frustrated and disappointed with them. It was always surprise after surprise.  I'm never considering going there again<//review>

Stereo city beat California sounds down the  price by $300 for a pioneer 8200nex and jl audio w7 12's and it's the match jl amps..
Ferris threw in a 2 year warranty on all my stereo equipment... Ferris was super down to earth and really care about the customers as I was waiting he can hear him trying to help this older gentle men that wasn't so tech savvy.. Very nice people!!! Check them out first!!< /text>

Came in to stereo city and purchased some 18's lexani rims 2days later I lost a rim cap and stereocity replaced it for me on the house, they are very generous and defiantly went outta their way for me. Especially I live all the way in Redlands Thanks Ferris and James.</text>

I have been coming here for years so trust me when I say stay away from this shop.
They try to hustle you here and the prices are really high. Me and my cousin have spent so much money on this place, but lesson learned.<//review>

< Review>
the worst experience i' ve ever had they lied to me about the price i was supposed to pay and got financed for the double price they e-sign for me a paper that was never given to me to read and didn't want to do any return and when i called and went in person to solve the problem they were so rude and didnt solve the problem. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AT ALL!!! and i will take them to court if i have to ... and also i spoke to the company that financed me and they submitted a report because they dont want to be making business with people who treat their customers like that so if you got financed by them and stereo city lied to you i suggest you make a report with the financing company<//Review>

Went into stereo city talked to ferris and he was very helpful with everything gave me a really good price on my system. Install took a little longer then expected but was definatly worth the wait. It sounds really good and its one of the cleanest installs ive had done i will definatly be going back for future installs.< /Text>

5 stars been coming here for a couple years now referred friends here no complaints on friends end or mine they do clean sounding work as a lot shops just put what has beat in ur car STEREO  CITY puts what suppose to be in your car with good sounding they find ways of working with you in prices. And getting you what  best fits you  hands  down stereo city where you find me when I say I'm at the shop.............shout out to ferris and the tall kinda skinny guy with bin laden  beard with the big nose ......don't take offense  but just don't know ur name so describe the best way I can .... . ..but like I said hands down  I'll be back over there soon to get my indoor speakers  put in fosgate all the way<//review>

Where to start don't go here i bought a stereo, subwoofer, two head rest monitor's and paid to install a play station into my car first i got my stereo installed and they told me at first they had all the stuff to install the play station but after i paid and sighed the contract they said they had to order a part for the play station that took longer than a week then my seering wheel controller for my stereo didn't work i had to wait over a month of coming back and fourth and then when they installed the head rest monitor i couldn't use my play station on them because i needed another part so i orderd it my self now they connected the play station to the monitor's but not my stereo and now they said it need another part that may or may not work to connect the stereo the monitor's and the play station but they avoid calling me at all cost i spent 4,200 here and is the biggest mistake of my life so take it from me don't go here and don't trust james he is the manager and im still trying to deal with the problem.<//text>

<text>Hi. I been coming to Stereo City for years. I lived here since 1986. Everytime i come here they awnser my questions and work with me when it comes to my funds. I come here everytime and my cars beat hard. Ferris helped me this last time and helped me get things i didnt think i could. Seriously, this place is legit.< /text><user_name>Facundo Fuentez</user_name><GmapID>0x80dcaccbc589a3b3:0x3aa845b42ee01fe0</GmapID></record>

<review>I originally had my hid's done at california sound down the street from stereo city. Joe had over charged me for them and they stopped working less than 3 weeks after the installation i went in for warranty and he didnt honor their warranty blaming me for the hid's going out. I left there furious and my friend told me about stereo city...
Let me start off by saying thank you jesus for Stereo City and Ferris. I had told them my sitution that had happened at california sound. Ferris was very quick to help me solve my issue as i couldnt drive at night.. Ferris really went out of his way to make sure i was taken care of on the hid's and the price. They offered me a one year warranty on the bulbs and ballast with no charge to exchange thw hid's if i had any issues. I had a really great experince at stereo city. Ferris is the sweetest sales guy iv ever met. I will most difenantly be back for morre work done.<//review><user_name>Jennifer Williams<//user_name>< user_id>
