<text>On an evening with reservations needed and a prix fixe menu, in the 1.5 hours that we were seated:

- We saw our waitress a grand total of ONE time
- Our drinks were not served
- Our food was not served
- We saw others tables literally standing up in attempt to wave down staff for help

When we went to inform the staff that we were leaving, the response was "Ok, well we won't charge you" - excuse me but charge us for what? Our drinks and food that never came?

If this was a normal insane / unexpected rush that the restaurant got caught short-handed for, I could give some leeway. However in times of Covid, with reservations needed, it's not possible to assume they were caught off-guard.

I sincerely hope that the owners understand that by attempting to cheap out on not hiring enough staff to handle the customer volume, they are losing more money in the process by having customers (such as myself) never return.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rate>1</rate></record>

<Text>It was mother's Day we waited over an hour to be seated then we waited 20 minutes to even have a waitress come and talk to us then we waited for water and bread everyone else was getting served but we did not the food was very bad my husband's and my son's steak were both fatty and grizzly and my salmon and my son salmon was very small for the $58 three course meal it was not worth it at all we will not be going back. They were overbooked super busy every time a server or a bus boy went by they would look at us and then ignore us nobody came over and said do you need anything we had to keep asking for someone to bring us water from someone to bring us food for someone to bring the glass of wine that I ordered don't go there.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< time>

We were there for a wedding reception. The surroundings were beautiful. The table setups were nice. The people serving the food did a great job. I had the salmon and it was okay at best. My husband had the ravioli with the vodka sauce and it was incredible! The bread on the table with a little dishes of bruschetta or whatever it was was excellent! The problem was there was two bartenders one for the restaurant and one for our huge wedding reception. However neither one of the bartenders seemed to know a lot of what they were doing. They were incredibly slow so the line was really long. It took almost a half an hour of standing in line to get a drink. I had to Tell the bartender how to make my dirty martini. Which in a restaurant like that should be common knowledge. Keeping people entertained and the drinks flowing is an important part of a party. By the end of the night everybody was frustrated and irritated. Then we found it nearly impossible to get a regular cup of coffee. Which doesn't make any sense at all. We were told if we wanted a regular cup of coffee we had to go to the restaurant. They didn't have coffee at the bar only cappuccino. So while I definitely might go back there for dinner sometime, and not order the salmon, I definitely would not consider having any kind of a party or reception there</Text>

<review>Well first off, I have driven by this place for a long time. I keep saying I will see op but never have. I love love love the setting. I can't wait to come back once it warms up to set outside by the waterfall.  We walked in and it was quiet. We were immediately served and then shortly greeted by our server Liz. Liz was born to wait tables.  Her people skills are sot on. We were brought out the most beautiful flat bread and dipping sauce. The bread came out hot as if it was made just for us.

We started our 1st course with the fried calamari. I am always on the hunt for the best version of this. It was not our favorite but it is very good. I will order again.

We went onto our next course of the rack of lamb and the New York steak. A party in your mouth for both dishes. It would be tough to decide what dish was better. My ice tea glass always stayed full. At some point during the dinner I dropped my cloth napkin on the floor. Without a moments hesitation a gentleman quickly came over and replaces it without asking. Now that's 1 st class service.

The only downer to me was dessert. I felt it was a little limiting. I am not a chocolate fan or cake for that matter. It irritates me a little when menus cater to heavily to chocolate fans. That is only my opinion.

It is a fine dance dance of front of the house and back of the house. If the chef is spot on and the servers are bad then people don't come back. If the server is on but chef is off people don't come back. However, when you are lucky enough to set in the station of Liz and experience the food coming out of this kitchen you will want to come back time and time again!!!!  Thank you Liz and I don't know the chefs name but blessings to him as well.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnmy14-9W33BKE-IGpvw4qzMnZ3xbfQRdEfFFg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9wx8u9MIWSVhlx-XMZV2KBfL1V2cuTxyhn_zF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPELNf5s6Ok-qK8qJDvpreemnX576sqgPklnK8n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

<rating>1</rating><text>I have dined at many restaurants in the California. Let me start by saying that the food was good and waitress who served the food was courteous. The problem is with the receptionist and the elderly person who seated us with "half mask on". They were rude. We didn't feel welcome, felt discriminated!
The staff in charge would smile and stop by my neighboring tables, and ask how the food was and checking if everything is alright, but would clearly ignore my table. Also, would smile and talk to all others in the restaurant except for us. We would never come back to this restaurant in Danville and would definitely NOT recommend to my friends.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
We had reservations for Mother's Day at 6:30 and we arrived at 6:15 and there was a long line already before is for people who had reservations at 6:00 p.m. the people in front of us didn't get seated until an hour after the reservation at 7: 09. We got seated shortly after that at around 7:15.  Once seated we sat there for 10 minutes wondering who was our waiter we asked one server and she just mumbled something and ran off and everybody at our table chuckled over what was that.  Little did we know this was only going to be the beginning of a nightmare experience at this restaurant.  For half the night we requested water from several different servers and nobody brought us any until the manager brought a pitchure of water and didn't know where our glasses were because nobody ever gave us water glasses.  My son and I requested the steak he likes it medium rare I like it medium neither of us got what we wanted it said it was supposed to come with mashed potatoes it came with these petrified wedges of potato that were horrible the only thing decently cooked was the string beans. Needless to say we will not be coming back here especially after paying nearly a $300 tab for this ridiculous horrific experience.  They added a 6% service charge on top of everything too. It was Mother's Day and we all wanted desperately to leave but since it was so busy everywhere we were afraid we wouldn't find another place to eat.</Review>

<Review>My husband and I arranged a date night to Faz this last week.  We hadn’t been before but by the look of the restaurant and pics online, it seemed like a good choice. Unfortunately we were terribly disappointed with the meal! We really enjoy Mediterranean cuisine but found the starter menu extremely limited! We ordered a COMBO PLATTER to start which was very basic, it came with burnt flatbread and 3 olives. I ordered the CHICKEN KABOB which was dry chicken with dry basmati rice. The rice was hard like it had been cooked earlier and left to dry out. The meal was so bland, boring and tasteless I had to use gulps of water to wash it down. I still cannot believe it came with no sauce.

My husband ordered the FETTUCCINI MARCO POLO which he felt was extremely fatty and rich, it also barely had any prawns in it.  My husband is a person who finishes whatever is on his plate and even he had to call it quits half way through his pasta.

We debated whether we wanted to stay for dessert and landed up ordering the  CHOCOLATE GANACHE, again dessert choices were extremely limited. This too was a complete disappointment, it promised to be a rich chocolate and the chocolate cake portion was virtually tasteless.  Needless to say we expected a lot more from Faz because they certainly aren’t shy to charge you! With no explanation we even had a 6% added to our menu which couldn’t be explained by the waiter except for “it’s something to do with Danville to help us because we can’t open and run at full capacity”. Um ... okay???<//Review>< Response>

Getting directly across in the Cisco buildings, you'll be surrounded by high tech employees for lunch.  The ceremony was very fast.  They'd parking below the building.  Food was quite good.  For lunch prior to suggestion, $30.  So not a inexpensive place to eat.< /text>

A friend of ours hosted a dinner there recently. I'll start with the ambiance, dinner was at night, the hanging lights, tall trees made it an intimate experience. The tables, drinks, etc were nicely set up. Dinner time. The chafing dishes and food was setup inside a small banquet area. The food was delicious, from the vegetables, chicken, beef kabobs, rice, condiments, all was set up excellently. The servers were attentive and on point. You may ask why the four stars? Well, minus one star because the outdoor area is not properly prepped, pine needles were falling on the tables, mosquitoes, and other bugs. Also, spiders falling from above. I wish they would have kept bug zappers, or sprayed at some point as well as getting tree service to make sure pine needles don't fall on tables. If you do hold a function in their courtyard, please keep this in mind. Otherwise, overall it was a pleasant experience.

Amazing food. Perfect place to host a party. Talk to Sandy, the catering director. She is super helpful and patient. Gave me various proposals so I could choose a menu for my budget. Out of all the places I called, Faz was by far the most professional and reasonably priced with fantastic service to go with the superb food!!<//text>

Classic Danville restaurant. Great food and a nice escape from the rest of Danville. Love the bar. I do miss the free flatbread pizza being served during happy hour. I also miss the wood fire grill and rotisserie. Some of the wait staff could use more training</text>

The food was good. Very relaxed semi-formal setting. We did think that the building was on fire at one point because it was a hot day and a bunch of smoke rose from the top of the building. It turns out that the cook puts a lot of wood in the wood fire oven which produces a lot of smoke.</Text>

< Review>
Absolutely super.  Three lamb shanks, one chicken kabob, and one veal: all done to a tee.  We sat in the open patio near a running fountain and tall redwood trees.  Lovely.  Drinks came quickly and the orders were taken.  The food arrived steaming hot and well presented.  The Chardonnay was fruity and smooth.  Deserts, bomba, sorbet, and lemon cake were quickly dispatched.  All in all a very pleasant experience.  The cost with drinks and deserts averaged about $60 per person.  Worth it and highly recommended.<//Review>

There was a wide variety of dishes, so there was someone for everyone. The service was attentive and pleasant, and the Bloody Marys were excellent. The large patio is absolutely gorgeous and so relaxing with the waterfall, surrounded by redwoods. There was a gentleman ( I think the owner) checking in at each table to say hi and see how our experience was. We would definitely go back.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>Fantastic food all year, but I particularly love their Thanksgiving buffet. All the standards - turkey, roast beef, mashed potatoes, green beans, carrots, yams, dressing - plus saffron rice, Afghan-style naan, roast salmon, smoked salmon, a dozen types of cheese (brie to cheddar to blue cheese...). Then there's pizza, homemade potato chips, pasta - if you really don't like Thanksgiving food, you'll be fine here. And a table full of desserts, from pumpkin pie to chocolate cake to melon chunks. Comfortable, interesting seating areas (including an enclosed patio), and the prices aren't bad - the Thanksgiving buffet is $45 per adult, drinks extra.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate>< Name>

A small but excellent wine list. Sometimes live music. A pretheatre menu. Best of all are their holiday buffets. For Thanksgiving it was all you can eat with roast beef and Turkey, pizza and chips, a Mideast buffet,a vegetarian buffet, a huge dessert buffet and a range of fruit and cheese for a single price. Go and enjoy.</review>< gmapID>

<Text>My significant other and I went there with another couple and their 3 kids.

It was a busy Saturday night and the table was not ready.  Not their fault. The prior guests were sipping coffee and taking their time.

The host set us up with a table by the bar. He really went above and beyond.

I liked that.

We ordered lamb kabobs, lamb shanks, and pizza. The kids all ordered burgers.

I sampled the lamb shank, and did not think much of it. But my significant other liked it.

The kebob was great. I was told that the pizza was also very good.

Kids loved their burgers.</Text></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Disappointing when compared to other places surrounding this restaurant. Although the lamb was nice and pink inside, the outside was burned. This made the overall flavor a bit too bitter for my taste. Also the side dishes were uninspired. The four of us all had different mains (beef, lamb, pork, salmon), but the sides were the same. Not original and the flavors didn’t match well. The price was too steep for the quality of the food.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x808f8cab8d03c931:0xfb1491608314393b< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

<review>Best posh restaurant in Contra Costa County.  Bar is great.  sometimes they have music.  Patio is on the east side of the building, so it is warm and great with the redwood trees.  Inside is plush.  Service formal but friendly.  Cuisine is the best.  Prices are very reasonable---I can entertain in a lux atmosphere without it costing me an arm and a leg.  Even the parking lot is great with Redwood trees.  Highly recommended.  I've been coming here for years and there is a reason why.  Located on Hartz Ave. on the southern end of downtown Danville.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe-R5VYJTNYEhHr7yViRApM9Lr1CSpjtgybVOn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1481259959668, 'text': "Davis, your praise means so much.

<text>My family went to Chahar Shanbeh Soori (The festival of fire) this last Tuesday for celebrations leading up to Persian New Year at Faz. Faz had highly advertised their culturally traditional festival celebration with a pre fix traditional Persian meal, live music, entertainers in costumes, and more for $49/pp. Our table of 7 was super excited for this event, we have frequented this restaurant over the years and have had generally positive experiences, until yesterday that is. To say that this place has gone down hill, is an understatement. Let's start off with the fact that they had no entertainers and no live music. Once seated, no server came to greet us, and after waiting some time, 10-15 minutes, on this uncommonly hot winter day, we all had to get up and go to the bar, from our table, to fetch our own drinks, they didn't even bring water to the table. The server couldn't have cared less, and the owner was fluttering about taking photographs of herself, absolutely ridiculous. The food just sent this experience into crash and burn, anyone who knows anything about Persian food, knows that chicken kabob is not baked chicken breast. This restaurant had the audacity to try and pass off baked chicken breast as chicken kabob, not only insulting anyone who went there for an authentic Persian meal, but a gyro shop in a strip mall, would've done a better job, waaaaay better. They had advertised kabob and chicken kabob, they brought 1 skewer of actual kabob, when we asked if they could bring more, they just said they had run out, no remorse, or apology, just whatever. 1 skewer, for 7 people??!! No salad as advertised, and to put the icing on the cake, dessert was to be included. We were served a small box of cookies made by the owner's bakery. Cookies are cookies, not dessert, maybe part of a dessert, or dessert you serve yourself at home. Absolutely insulting. Faz has a great location, and great people in Danville who are willing to spend money.  But if you care at all about how you are treated as a customer, service, food quality, and how you pay it forward, stay as far away from this place as possible. Terrible.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>
{'time': 1490452839898, 'text': "I'm sorry you weren't happy with our Caharshanbeh Suri celebration this time. You've joined us several times before, so you know it truly is out of character for us to be slower on service. I apologize if that was the case this time, though, and hope you'll understand that we do our best to make sure everyone is well taken care during busy events like this one. As for your meal, I want to assure you that we'd never serve anything we didn't think was authentic and true to our roots. Things don't always go as planned, and sometimes we're short on food during events with such a high volume of people. That's our mistake, and we sincerely apologize. I hope to have the chance to regain your trust again soon -- I know we're capable of doing better than this. - Maher Karjawally"}<//Response>

I came here with my family for Thanksgiving dinner buffet. The service was great, but I felt the food quality was lacking a bit especially given how much it was per person.

Be very careful.  Not only are you paying top $$ for merchandise, but you are getting something that comes with NO followup, NO customer service once the item is delivered.  best of luck if there's damage or if something breaks within the first year.  No one from Pirch will assist you.  The sales rep will pass your number to others, they will email you saying we'll get back to you.. they will give you the run around and never assist you.  Be wise, shop around and don't fall for the fake smile you get when you walk into the store.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Unfortunately they are still using the Covid-19 excuse to have low staff, I believe it's time to start to get away from that excuse to not staff your store ( It's still in the greyish area but the excuse is getting old)<//review>

Pirch Glendale is awesome!  We luckily had a very pleasant experience as the caliber of work that was done with our remodel was absolute insanity. Any time a custom home is built there is always going to be tremendous amount of detail so the appliance/plumbing book was a huge hit with everyone at my property that Pirch put together.  Patricia B., our rep at Pirch made it an incredibly seamless and transparent experience!< /review>

The old saying "Do not judge a book by its cover" can definitely be applicable in this situation.  At the store level they treat and welcome you with good customer service by offering you drinks such as gourmet coffee.  Also, if you are in the market for new equipment you can make an appointment for a chef to cook your favorite dish and you can ask questions on the equipment.  That is a brilliant marketing tool because they make you feel as if you are a significant customer.

Once you commit and make the purchase here is where the service are no where near as the above.  My experience with Pirch has been a nightmare from scheduling of delivery and installation.   The delivery was such a bad experience because they sent two individuals to deliver a 900 pound refrigerator for one they could not handle the weight and they did not have the proper tools to get the refrigerator in my house.  If I and a few other people working in my house were not around at the time of delivery the equipment would have never made into my house.  Also, it took them about 3 hours to get the equipment in the house.  The most challenging thing was that the installation team did not have the proper tools and they wasted my time and they did not installed anything.

I'm still awaiting for a part that was to be deliver during installation on September 11, 2015, and I'm still waiting on the delivery of that part as I write this review.

This means that there is a disconnect between the installation group and the rest of the Company.

The installation team are less than competent and lack the training necessary to provide great service and great experience.<//review>

<text>Hello I entered Pirch back in December 2018 and during this time i was greeted by a Rene Sweeney who appeared to be extremely responsive to my $50-60,000. purchase i made at that time.  However, after I experienced some construction delays I  push back taking delivery of my Wolf and Sub Zero Appliances, I notice when calling Rene she would direct me to their Project Managers and showed no interest in being of assistance, so I started dealing with Pirch Project Coordinator and Project Manager assigned to my account at first glance lead me to believe such a professional organization as I  later discovered how this company is so poorly run and operated from the Top Down.  Their Project Manager sent out a onsite installer to confirm all the kitchen build out were correct.  I was told all was fine except for a electrical and the hood correction, which I did.  At no point did Pirch send someone out to confirm the new kitchen corrections were completed correctly.  So I had Pirch finally come to deliver and their installer tells me he cant install due to mistakes in the build out which according to the Pirch Installer it called for a Flat Panel installation.  I went back to Rene she directed me to the Store director Giles and explained to him that i had never requested for a Flat Panel installation and did not understand why the installer stated there would be one on the order.  Long story short Giles offers me a $500.00 rebate and 6 Complementary cooking classes assures me they will deliver ASAP.  This was nearly over a week ago and I have sent countless emails to their project coordinator and 3-4 Text message to the Store Director Giles and general get a response back from Giles if lucky 12-24 hours later and what does he do to defend their Company POINTS OUT TO A 25% RESTOCKING FEE IF YOU CANCEL YOUR ORDER.  Pirch is a company I would stay clear from as they struggle with customer service and struggle with coordination between their Sales People, Store Director and their Installation Dept.  I have been forced to dispute my charges with AMEX and went out to another Wolf/Subzero Dealer to make my purchase. Which have me scheduled to deliver in 2 business days.  In the mean time i am still waiting for Giles or someone at Pirch to respond to my text messages and emails.< /text></record>

<Time>1531929818259<//Time><Rate>1</Rate><user>109465528094955906038<//user><Review>. I work in a multi million dollar home where all the of appliances where purchased from Pirch.

I have a dishwasher that has been broken for a month, ONE MONTH. Numerous phone calls and supposedly Jen or Jennifer was out of town. They have one person dealing with warranties and she doesn’t forward her emails??? She finally contacted back and said she would send someone right out. Now another week has gone by and no return calls or texts. I am so upset, this is seriously absurd.

Great selection, stay away if you want service later. Horrible.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2c0ff99484d73:0xd2f9233ebc83e63b< /GmapID><name>iris noack< /name>< Pictures>

This has been the best company to deal with for both plumbing and appliances.  Their pricing was more than competitive yet,  their service AND follow up were exceptional.  When we first saw the showroom and were given the full treatment,  we thought their pricing would be high.   Not so at all.  Leon,  our sales rep,  was so knowledgeable and helpful.  I am so happy my designer,  Nicolette Akiko from Studio Akiko, took me there.  I strongly recommend everyone give then a chance.< /Review>

<rating>2</rating><text>Great selection,  there are much better places to actually purchase the items. We went in before we purchased our new kitchen appliances because they were open on Sunday's when all other stores that carry the same brands were closed. Wound up buying a faucet,  they assign a project manager (which is laughable) to follow your purchase,  we went in to pick up the items when they were delivered to the store, there were items on the order we didnt need, so we had to wait for the return. a couple weeks later the project manager called and said the balance of my items were in,  i had everything i ordered so they were incorrect.

The point is, great place to look, there are places to buy that actually care for your business and understand service. Im os glad we purchased the appliances somewhere else<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

< review>
I bought numerous items from Mike. It started off with drinks, a cheese dish and appetizers. By the end of this rock star treatment I bought a 43 inch la cornuefé range, couple faucets, and frankè sinks. This company is amazing in so many aspects. Ranging from salesperson, knowledge, high-quality items to delivery and install. The delivery personelle Priscilla Kostal is punctual, accomdating and professional. Not only am I impressed with the quality, the time of delivery but this experience has been a smooth and effortless on my part. A great big thank you to Mike and Priscilla for the royal treatment. Impeccable job! Ok so I wanted to also include Alex and Christian in this appreciation review. They installed the stove and hood. They were professional, dedicated and highly detailed. It came out flawless. As a customer I will most certainly come back due to this marvelous experience from ordering, receiving merchandise to install was perfect. Thank you Pirch team!<//review>

My name is George I went to go look for used tires. They found 2 tires my size with good tread. Empire gave me a price for the tires that couldn't be beat, but I only had so much money and they accommodated my financal issue and gave me great customer service with a smile and got me back on the road with in 15 minutes. I recommend this fine establishment to everyone. Thanks empire tire. Thanks to the owner Fred and his crew.</Text>

Best tire shop in town. Always friendly and very professional. The owner is very knowledgeable, and honest. Its worth a little extra drive to go there instead of the other shops in town.</Review>

These guys were awesome. I got an absolutely great price for 4 tires. They put them on fast so I was able to get on with the rest of my day. You MUST check with Empire Tire Co. before making a decision on tires.<//review>

I went here to get me a tire. Not only do they have good used tire's for the low,great workers and good customer service. But before I could have a chance to enjoy the cold air in the lobby, it was time to pay and go. I would defiantly good back and recommended that if you in the area and need a tire hit them up.<//Text>

<Text>PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF I could give them negative stars I would. They are a bunch of thieves. I gave them thousands of dollars for parts they were going to order. Long story short they never ordered my parts and didn't give my money back. I would call to get an update on weather my parts were ready and they would always say "they will be here soon"  which is all they would say for  6 months. It was then that I knew they were all Liars and had not actually ordered any parts. They even told me "we are not getting yours parts of giving your money back". They will take your money and keep it. It has happened to others at this same spot but I did not know prior to going to this place. If you have had a similar experience with them write it on here and let me know. A Sheriff has a recording of all this. Alfred and Steve agreed on all of this when I brought a sheriff in. Do not trust these guys they are a bunch of cowards.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Check your tires Fred , sold me one that was cracked on the side wall and told me to come back when he opened it completely which was in may.  Took it back his brother said come back when we sort out tires we just got a shipment, called back like a week later cuz I was busy working  then Fred says "well u bought them two months ago." hummm you just opened your shop in may     But whatever that's a good way to get customers.   Good luck on your new rip off tire shop<//text><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

<review>I’ve never gone to a tire shop that doesn’t balance your tires, as matter of fact they have no machine to balance your tires! They will send you down the street but only after you notice that they did not balance your tires to begin with!<//review></record>

< Review>
This place is awesome. The owner really gave my girl and I the winning expirerence. He was busy, by himself. We understood. Walking around we had a bunch of questions. I asked about fish, she asked about clams and we both wanted to know the price on some high end zoas (hard to find) he answered all and even gave us a great deal on the zoas. Zoas I know go for 90 pp here in Sacramento. It was well worth the drive.< /Review>

<Date>1496066966905< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><review>So excited, the owner Tyler Garrett came over yesterday afternoon to set up our reef tank! It looks amazing! I can't wait until it's ready to start adding all of the wonderful and colorful corals and fish they have in stock at their store. I can't believe how automated and high tech these systems have become. If you're considering investing in a salt water tank I highly recommend the knowledgeable staff at NorCal Corals...Thank you Tyler!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Great store with very friendly people who will help you find exactly what you’re looking for. This is an upscale shop for someone who wants lots of individual help and attention when choosing new running shoes or even looking for ways to improve their run. Everyone I spoke to was very knowledgeable and kind.</review>

I was able to get an analysis of my running gait and leave with a new pair of shoes in about 30 minutes! The process was seamless yet detailed and customized to my needs. The person helping me had me try at least 4 pairs of shoes to make sure I left with the perfect pair for me. I'd highly recommend this store for anyone looking for a new pair of shoes!</Text>

Mira is amazing!! I’ve got some fat, high arch feet so finding the right shoe has been a constant work in progress. Finally got proper measurements and felt like I was walking on a cloud in my new shoes. Highly recommend.</Text>

Decent place to buy shoes, customer service and individual service is top notch. Could have used a larger spikes selection, especially for track season. But other than that good place to buy running shoes.<//Review>

Staff is incredibly friendly. They measured my feet, recorded my stride and recommended the best shoes for me. Thanks for the help! Also, the store is very well equipped. I found the smart watch I was looking for.</review>

The best experience I've had buying running shoes. Patrick spent nearly 45 minutes with me looking at my gait, my arch placement, letting me run up and down the street, and carefully listened to all my needs. If you want  top shelf service with a great range of specialty running shoes, A Runner's Mind is a great choice.</Text>

Legendary for a reason. Their staff is quite friendly and knowledgeable, and their shoe fitting service is very thorough. They record you running and replay the video in slow motion to see how your feet tend to hit the ground!< /Text>

Great store! The employees are very patient and thoughtful. Jason was able to explain the source of some of my running-related pain (by video recording). I got plenty of time to try on many different shoes hand selected based on my arch shape, foot shape and running style. Walked out with shoes I really like at a solid price.

Worth the time to go in to a store like this rather than ordering blindly online.</Text>

Adventured over to Runner's Mind today and it was well worth it!  Carlos was amazing, and fitted me into a pair of Adidas that I love and fit like a glove so I felt obliged to run all the way home...No more funny fits with online buys and the hassle of returns.  Go in for your custom fit and care!!!  Thank you Los, I will be back...</text>

We were very pleasantly surprised by the level of one on one service and attention. Carlos was great and was able to multi task with several customers at the same time. Super happy with this experience and will definitely recommend this store to any other friends looking for running shoes!<//Text>

great place to get a new pair of running shoes.  they video your stride and talk you through the shoes and footbeds you may need to balance you out.  they also give you a month to exchange your shoes for another pair if they don't work out as hoped.  you pay full retail price, but their service and expertise more than makes up any price difference.  highly recommended<//review>

Very impressed by this store. First of all, the experience is spectacular with individualized attention and recommendations based off of foot shape and running gait. Second of all, their prices are competitive and similar to what you would find online or in another store. Third of all, they offer a 30-day return policy on their shoes and insoles. Finally, they have twice a week running for free.<//Text>

<Text>I had previously gotten a pair of Asics Gel Kayano 23 a few years ago at this place. It's good to know that the quality in service has not changed since then. The staff here is fully dedicated to finding a running shoe that fits your need. They closely examine your running gait by having you jog down the street while being recorded. They will show you any issues with your gait in slow mo and hand select different shoe models to help with your specific gait. Laura was the staff member helping me today and she was outstanding in finding the best running shoes for me. She even provided some extra stability (I have a low arch and I overpronate) by recommending an insole as well. Will definitely recommend this place to my friends.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Laura spent an hour with me analyzing my gait, bringing out half a dozen shoes for me to try, and then finding the right insert for me (careful, those are $50 a pop).

I walked out of there a happy camper and washer to try my Nike Air Zoom Structure 22!< /Review>

<text>I had a fantastic experience at A Runner's Mind. Derek was knowledgeable, patient, and personable throughout the fitting process. He took his time to record my gait with an iPad, explain the video, and give a detailed (yet accessible) recommendation from the footage of my run.  He then gave me a variety of shoes to test run until we found the one that worked best. It was overall a very pleasant experience and I highly recommend this shop.

Thanks for your help Derek!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Got my first pair of running shoes. The staff helped analyse my feet shape and arch height followed by my running style, using slow motion video, to recommend the best shoe for me. They had me try different pairs and asked me to test them out by running around to see what was comfortable. Made me feel that I got personalised service and was not rushed.<//review>

I popped in as my friend was raving about this store. She is right; A Runner's Mind has a very knowledgeable and friendly team who help you pick the best shoes and insoles (if you wish) that matches your feet shape and general running style. They make you feel unique by taking the time, recording how you run  and show what to look out for.
I highly recommend going here!< /text>

A great experience!!! I learned a lot about how a running shoe should fit and the specifics about my feet.  I would highly highly recommend especially if you're new to running and trying to figure out what kind of shoe to buy.  They have a 30-day return policy which gives you a chance to actually use the shoe in real life and see if it works for you.<//review>

These guy's are awesome! The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable. They go out of their way to deliver perfect customer service. Not only did they put me in the perfect pair of shoes (Saucony Liberty iso2) and running pants (vuori ponto performance) they didn't try any annoying upselling.

They delivered on exactly what I was looking for and would highly recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

I looked up a local running store needing a massage stick, and walked out with shoes fitted to my running mechanics and foot arch.  I’ve been a soccer player and sprinter, from youth thru college so I’m no stranger to running - but this store is hands down the best I’ve been to.

Once you narrow down the proper footwear, they let you take it for a quick run down the block to get acquainted. They answer all of your questions thoughtfully, and in no way to you ever feel rushed or pressured. They truly want to help you be healthy and happy.

There’s also a little notebook at checkout where you can write down anonymously what you’re grateful for.

This place is world class! Can’t wait to join their group runs on Tuesday and Thursday. thanks for the help Jordie!</text>

<Text>If you're new to running and need advice/assistance on what running shoes to get, this is the running store to go to in San Francisco! I have been running for several years now, but it was nice to go through the whole process of how they recommend running shoes for you: measuring your foot size accurately and looking at your pronation, watching you and recording you while running for a block to analyze your running form/gait, and then recommending several brands for you to try (for me, I tried on Brooks, Altra and On and settled on Altra Paradigms). They also helped me get an insole to help with my left ankle stability and some much needed new running socks.

And if you're new to the area or live close, they also do regular group runs, to help you get into running! I joined their "Cable Car Chase" and that was a great event!

Thanks A Runner's Mind!</Text>< response>

<review>Best running store in the area. Knowledgeable staff who take the time to learn what they need to know about your running style to find the right gear for your body. Also great community spirit with their events & info sessions :) Anytime a friend needs new running shoes or is wearing something that doesn't seem to be helping them, I recommend a visit to ARM to take some shoes out for a try.

Im more of a general sneaker kinda guy. Walking in, the store was clean, welcoming and had an adoreable older (friendly as can be) golden retriever walking around the store (owners i assume).

I was helped immediately, and told the woman that i had knee problems and wanted a comfortable cushioned shoe. I was given a heat map to step on for arch measurement, measured and than made to walk so she could see how my steps/footwork looked.

I was than reccomended 3 styles of sneaker. I made my choice, and couldnt be happier! The love and care that the employees and owner show , make this a cut above the rest. Whenever im back in SF ill be buying another pair!<//text>

<Review>Came in here on a whim after walking past the day before. Staff were very friendly, efficient, and helpful. The gait test helped to determine the proper shoe, and since then a lot of the previous issues I had with a previous pair of running shoes have gone away. The shoes may be a bit expensive, but its worth it to find the shoe that offers the most support and comfort in your athletic activities, and to support this small business.<//Review><GmapID>0x80858733c385087d:0x30e84fbf0091da04<//GmapID>< Rate>

Excellent service.  The employees will make sure you get the right shoe for your goals / feet.  Plus a 30-day return policy if the shoes don't work out.<//Text>

I have a sprained ankle due to running. Running is bad for my health yet I begrudgingly do it. To minimize further injuries, I come here to be fitted for the proper running shoes. I hate running a little less with the proper shoes.  The friendly and knowledgeable staff helps with the process a lot. Be warned, they will make you run to try out shoes.<//text>

Here you'll receive the time and patience of staff who are truly trying to help you find the best shoe. If you're there when it's busy, it can take some time as staff are pulled in many directions.< /text>

Efficient & friendly. Guy went out of his way to try and find the Oofos sandals in my size in another store when they didn't have it in their store.</Review>

If you are an experienced runner or a beginner, shop here.

It is by far the best running shop in the bay area.  I have purchased my second pair of running shoes here and they take the time to understand the time of runner you are, your gait / issues and are extremely knowledgeable and unbiased about getting you the right shoe for you.

Atticus is the most knowledgable "fitter" and is a super nice person, as is the rest of the staff led by Monte.

Also, they have fun runs and are an incredibly supportive and un-judgemental group of people.  You will be welcomed and taken care of.  Highly recommend.</Text>

<Review>Came here for the first time and the staff was super friendly! They had an abundance of options from shakes, icecream, smoothies, sundays and floats to cupcakes, blended coffee and donuts. The icream flavors were new and unique and honestly I felt like I was given a masterpiece of a sunday. The lady even added on extra toppings and a sample of her favorite icecream! Highly recommend!<//Review><rate>5< /rate>< name>

Very good, I tried this place today considering I just moved near by and I had a sundae and a cupcake and I must say the cupcake was very delicious and moist and the sundae as well was great and the people were so nice and friendly however it disappoints me that the prices are so high 😞 I definitely can’t afford to come here all the time but I will definitely be back.</review>

Got a blended coffee milkshake thing. Was very good, but paid a little under 8 DOLLARS for a coffee milkshake. Definitely too a high price for area and I know 1000% they'd sell more if they were more affordable. Quality shake but when I feel like im
paying 10$ (rounding up and general feeling) most likely not going back. Notjing wrong with paying for quality though. Good luck to you guys.<//Text>

The ice cream is great! It's always fresh and there is always a great selection. They feature ice cream from Gunther's. The banana ice cream is the best! The shop is always clean and the service is always friendly. I've been getting ice cream there for about ten years.<//Text>

Nice and friendly service. Hand packed ice cream cones or waffle bowls. Service slow but they tend to customers very nicely.

<Review>Was craving boba drinks so googled places and found this spot. It's located central in this tiny plaza. Decent parking available. The shop was cutely decorated. The guy working was patient with all our questions and very helpful with suggestions. :) The drinks we got weren't as sugary as expected, which was a good thing! They were light and refreshing, without feeling like a super sugar overdose lol</Review>< pics>

< Review>
We have so many boba shops on Convoy and through out San Diego but this place is our all time favorite.

I always get the classic Vivi milk tea no boba. But this time I tried the coffee milk tea from the top 16 list. Wasn’t my favorite because I was craving for coffee and all I tasted was milk tea. Which is good if I had ordered the original classic milk tea. Reason I like their milk tea is that it’s strong. It has the right proportion of tea and flavor.

My boyfriend also always gets almond milk tea. Not many places have that on the menu. (Vivi no longer has it on their menu). We were told Vivi took it off their menu because it never sold out..lol. However we like to think it’s from the “secret menu”. It’s not too sweet and you can taste the almond extract.

Don’t forget to ask for a stamp card to get your 11th cup free!<//Review>

Literally my favorite boba place ever. Came here spontaneously as the other shop i was planning to go to was closed, and i am SO GLAD i did. I have been back 3 more times since then. My favorites are definitely the blue galaxy and the flaming brown sugar milk tea, with their classic milk tea and signature fruit tea also being FANTASTIC. 10/10, no boba place has surpassed the flavors/drink quality/boba quality/variety of this one!</Text>

The boba is a big let down. Their menu sounds fun and look like they would be tasty. However after trying two different drinks from here I found their boba milk teas to be terrible. Just tastes like a little bit of sugar in water.</text>

My favorite place to get boba and the only place my son will drink from. Get the Vivi Signature Fruit Tea or the Kumquat Fruit Tea.</Review>

When I moved to San Diego from Brooklyn, I thought I would have to travel all the way back for my Vivi. To my surprise, a Vivi opened up soon after I arrived! Vivi is the best bubble tea I have ever had, and this location is no different. Every single drink I've ever ordered is amazing, even turning my husband into a bubble tea lover. Love the owners and employees of this shop also 💜</Text>

<Review>One of my favorite boba in convoy m! The 3Q milk tea is a mush try, and the galaxy is the most beautiful drink I’ve seen ever! Their milk tea has more tea flavor, which is the reason I like them. I always go after 30% percent sugar.</Review><Date>1529258544495</Date><userid>113945033418482341444</userid><gmap_id>0x80dbffe941d00001:0xdab8b3ba32ca1dfc</gmap_id><name>moyuan huang</name>< Rate>

I took my car in this morning for brakes. They checked it out, got back to me fast with a price and did the job really quick. Everyone i dealt with was very helpful and friendly. Thanks so much for the great service!<//Text>

Had the work done 2 days ago and drove home. I gave a 4 🌟 Now today I drove up to SkyPark at Santa's Village and what a nice drive. They got all the squeaks fixed, Brakes work great, no pulling to the right or left. My truck is like driving on air. If they had a 10 🌟 that would be it</Text>

This place is great.  We had an issue with our windshield leaking.  They went above and beyond to repair the damage it caused.  Worked on the it all day..  the staff is super friendly, really know what they're doing and take the time to do it right.  Could not be more pleased.<//Review>

<text>I‘ve been a customer of this company mostly at the Norco location and I have always had very good, competent service and I have spent thousands over a span of more than a decade. Today I called for an oil change and was told that they could get to me within 15 minutes which was perfect. Now no matter what one’s opinion of wearing a mask to reduce the spread of Covid-19 , the facts are that if we care about each other we would not want to take the slightest chance of spreading the virus to our fellow human beings. And if a company really cares then it’s employees would wear a mask when greeting customers in the showroom. It would at least show customers that their safety is a priority. I wouldn’t necessarily expect the techs to wear a mask while working on the car. So while I really needed an oil change and trusted these guys to do it I chose to leave. I did not discuss it with the employee who was not wearing a mask. I was very disappointed.<//text>< Rate>

I literally just left Mountain View tire about 5 minutes ago. I want to say thank you to the gentlemen up front who helped me with my tire pressure light concern, they checked my tires at no cost and I couldn't be more grateful. Great customer service. I can't even imagine the royal  treatment I would get it I was actually a customer .<//text>

Mountain view tires has done a great and beyond job this morning for me, I had 3 studs holding my front passenger tire , yes I know dangerous and out of the 3 that were holding only 2 studs were good and the 3rd was crossed threaded, so been in a tuff budget for beginning of the month they had solutions but little more cost and I just couldn't but little did I know they adjusted the studs that were broken and changed  1  and other little tricks they had up there sleeve and now I have ALL 5 STUDS BACK..truely a good blessed  Saturday cant never thank them enough. God bless you guys and thanks again for sending a dangerous car going in and coming out a safe car for the road.  Now they have a loyal customer that will come back for other services they have to offer  because I know my car is in good hands.< /text>

I love how they will not try to sell you anything that you do not need and always stand by their service if you have any issues later on with your vehicle that isn't even related.

I'd highly recommend having Sam, Charles and all of the guys work on your cars.  You will not be disappointed with your decision,  they'll take good care of you and your precious car:)</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Great place. They don't only do tires. They are trustworthy mechanics. They told me the best thing to do is get rid of my car instead of trying get me to have them work on it because I would be paying too much.</Text>

Tony is awesome! I have a high maintenance car and showed up with a dead battery and no one else could order a battery for me (I tried 4 other places, they l said they couldn't work on a Volkswagen or it would be a day or so to order a battery) I showed up this morning all stressed out, he said no worries! He ordered it and it was here within the hour.  I will never take my car anywhere else from here in out!!!</text>

<review>I've never experienced better service with any car situation (dealer, mechanic, etc)- wish I lived closer so I could use this team for all of my car's needs!

I dropped in today not sure what was going on with my car- it was making strange noises and I needed to get back to LA to get to work ASAP. Everyone I spoke with was exceptionally helpful and friendly, they brought my car back immediately, told me exactly what was going on, and I was able to drive away much more quickly than I expected. Couldn't be happier with how the situation was handled and really appreciate the service today!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcb86efdd6a8cd:0x70a49649e1f9371a<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Last Sunday was just one of those days where everything is going so wrong.  When your car decided to break down on you twice in the freeway.
But luckily! This place was in the right place!
I took the nearest exit & I saw this place.Ricardo greeted me and smiled! So friendly!  they treated me so kindly, they took care of my car and helped me with prices. I’ve never been so eager to write a review just now. They truly are a hero! CHARLIE! You’re so freakin awesome thank you so much for your help and understanding! To Romeo, thank you as well!   I had a tire replacement before, it took them whole day. And mine was inspected and they made sure I’m safe. And the other friendly people!!! You guys are amazing for sure ! And will never forget my experience.  Will definitely recommend this place. And I will definitely come back ❤️ Thank you again and keep rocking guys!!!  Love the people & place ✨<//Text>

<Text>These guys quite frankly hit a home run on service. After being let down by my go-to company for tires, I drove across the street as I recalled a buddy having a great experience. Ed was a super nice guy, and while buying new high quality tires is a drain on the wallet, these guys never pressured or tried to up-sell.  I recommend them to anyone in the market for new tires!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I came in due to a flat tire yesterday, luckily I was able to drive in with my spare tire in place. A very nice gentleman named Charlie helped me out right away. They did not have the tire I needed in stock at the shop but they were able to get one quickly and install it in no time. Knowledgable and courteous staff!</Text>

From John Lillywhite:  From tire replacement to engine work, I have been going to this place for years now.  Why?  Because they do excellent work!  I have NEVER been disappointed.  They understand the importance of repeat business and the power of customer satisfaction.  Top notch all the way!  I don't give accolades unless the service is stellar!!!< /review>

<Date>1438647898042< /Date><text>My daughter's Honda was overheating and I live 3,000 miles away from Corona. I found MVT by calling NAPA and asking the counter guy "where is the best repair shop in town?" They told me that this place does all kinds of repairs (not just tires) and that they were good. I called their manager, Charles, and from the get-go, he was really good. They checked my daughter's compression and found the head gasket was blown. He said that they sub out their motor rebuilds and that their shop had done hundreds of jobs for them with only 1 issue, a transmission that was replaced after it failed.
Long story short: the Honda engine was rebuilt for exactly what they said it would cost. I was in constant contact with Mountain View, who kept tabs on the rebuild shop for me and they never even charged me for the engine check! The car runs great and I don't have to worry about my kid. Thank you Charles, I'm sure my daughter will be back if she has any other problems (engine was warrantied for 6 years, so I'll bet it won't be for that!)
Update 8-3-2015 My daughter's Honda has had a couple problems since the initial engine rebuild and MV auto has looked at her car twice WITH NO CHARGE at all! They changed the oil once and fixed a rattling muffler heat guard. If you use another repair shop, you are crazy in my opinion.< /text>< Rating>

(Translated by Google) They spent, the truth at first gave me a low price and ah when to pay they left me with an add account more than a thousand dollars just to make, the changes in front of the brakes, terrible service I really do not recommend it, better ah The other people's cars will be cheaper, I assure you, I am very unhappy with the service, the truth is

(Original)
Se pasaron , la verdad al principio me dinieorn un precio bajo y ah la hora de pagar me salieron con una cuenta add más de mil dólares solamente por hacer , los cambios de enfrente de los frenos , pésimo servicio la verdad no lo recomiendo vállanse mejor ah la ajencia de sus , carros les saldrá más barato eso se los aseguro , estoy muy disgusto por el servicio la verdad< /review>

<Text>We have walked by this place probably five times and always wanted to stop in but had the kids with us so could not. Next time we're even going to take the dog.  It's a great place that you can bring your own food or order in from local restaurants and have a fantastic time enjoying local craft brews.  I enjoyed the local ciders, and Vicky enjoyed the Honey Pot Blonde IPA on tap.</Text>< userid>

A small spot but a great one.

If you are a bit picky or adventurous with your beer choices, Out of the barrel isn't a bad place to stop by.

They offer a wide selection on tap and offer craft beer by the bottle/can to take home. Sadly, they don't offer a growler service but if you want a great place to stop for a pint and eat lunch  then this place will hardly steer you wrong.

It's also pet friendly with outdoor seating making for a great summer drinking spot.< /text>

Great place, delicious beer choices in draft and sooo many choices for cans to go. Tvs inside, outside seating as well, they allow outside food and the patio is dog friendly.
I will definitely be back, so good< /Review>

<review>This really amazing girl & I went here on our first outing together. We had a really awesome time together & the ambience was awesome!

The place is super chill. They have a wide variety of beer selections on tap, mostly IPA’s, which I’m not a huge fan of, but still, the variety is awesome. Personally, I go for Belgian style wheat ales.

Furthermore, you can bring your own food & there is Whole Foods right next door!

The only recommendation I’d make is that they invest in outdoor heaters as it can get a bit chilly at night during the winter months.</review><Rate>5</Rate><user_name>Vijay Krishna<//user_name><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

So happy this place came to Fresno. If you’re looking for a nice spot to have a drink with a great vibe, this is your place. Nothing else like it in Fresno or Clovis. They have wine, cider, hard kombucha, and regular kombucha for any non-beer drinkers! The owner is a beer connoisseur and brings in so many unique finds. Great location, right in the middle of Fig Garden Village with easy access to restaurants.<//Text>

We'll stick to Tap & celler, who actually provides the best beer and customer service.
I'll pass on a judging place that cuts people off that are not rude, disrespectful to any one when we all were having a good time.
Hire some better employees< /review>

I hope you understand when our staff makes the decision to cut someone off, they are acting in the best interest and safety of the customer, our business, and the law. Our staff is not only trying to provide a comfortable environment for all customers, but they also have to be mindful of the liability we have if we over serve someone. If we fail to make the appropriate call, we could not only lose our license to operate, but we could also be held liable for all damages that person may cause.\nAs I told the other people in your group, I would hope that you can understand where our staff is coming from when they have to make a difficult decision and respect the decision that a bartender makes (regardless of what bar it is) when they are in that position in the future.'}</Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Great tap room, especially with new expanded seating outfront. Would go here for draught beer any day. Friendly bartenders will give a taste before buying a pint. 4-packs of cans togo seem way over priced though. Maybe thats the going rate now...<//text></record>

Instagram says alvarado cans will arrive today by 230. I call and they said tomorow. Same thing happened with dank shake. Im not wasting time making a drive to get cans from there. It seems like they are always unsure when it comes to the good releases.</Review>

<response>{'time': 1590641717253, 'text': "Hey Kulvinder, I am sorry to hear about your disappointment. Please make sure you are following the correct instagram account: @outofthebarrelfresno (not campbell). We typically pick up Alvarado cans direct from the brewery on the day of release (Wednesday's) and drive them back to our Fresno taproom ourselves on Thursday, along with fresh beer from several other small, independent breweries that do not deliver to the Central Valley (don't worry, they remain in cold storage overnight!). We are a small company and operating within our means, so sometimes it takes us an extra day or two to get beer to the taproom from all different breweries around the state. I hope you can understand this and know that we are doing our best to bring Fresno the freshest, most delicious beer possible. I hope you'll reconsider your review and try us again another time.\nJust FYI, due to a multitude of other factors (mostly preparing to comply w/ all the state/county COVID-19 restrictions to re-open), we will be delivering our large weekly load of fresh beer on Friday this week."}</response>< Gmap_id>

<rate>3< /rate><Text>I am a Pils (ner) drinker.  In Germany nearly every brewery also brews a PILS and not just the lagers, wheat beers, etc.  While this pub advertises 30+ beers on tap, not a single Pilsener style beer was available.  The staff said that beers are rotated through, but oddly there is always a LAGER though from different breweries.  As a core beer offering it would make sense to always have the following types of beer available:

•	WHEAT
•	LAGER
•	STOUT
•	PILS
•	IPA
•	ALE
•	Other styles…okay, even the fruity ones

When I asked for a PILS I was directed to the other offerings.  Oddly, another customer there heard my request for a PILS and said that he too had requested one but they did not have one.

A pub style establishment should also cater to Pils drinkers, which are generally only interested in a Pils but are then compelled to switch to another style of beer.  I find that in the Fresno area, restaurants/pubs simply either decide not to offer a Pils or, as I found in a Clovis Pub, don’t even know what a Pilsner is. Some others think a Pils is strictly the PILSNER from the Czech republic  and do not realize that it is not a brand but a style of beer.  There are California breweries that offer a Pilsner, though they are not up to par.  Typically served without any foam or very little, and everything seems to focus on alcohol content instead of taste.  Sequoia Brewing has a China Peak Pilsner, but  they serve it without the head that is an important part of a Pils or any real beer.  Sequoia also has a double Pilsner with more than 8% alcohol, which then ruins the real Pilsner taste.

If Out of the Barrel simply had a regular offering of …let’s say WARSTEINER PILS, it would be very helpful.  One Pils like that is enough and it is available as a draught beer in California.  I used to drink it at the Aisling Bog Irish Pub on West Herndon but that place sold and the new owner decided not to get it back in…as a matter of fact….she was clueless when I asked for a Warsteiner Pils. That was just before the Pandemic, so I do not know if the pub (name had changed) is still in business.

I liked the atmosphere in Out of the Barrel, especially that it seems to facilitate conversation between people, without everyone watching some big screen or only looking at their cell phones.  There is no food served there, so it would be helpful for the pub to simply post phone numbers for  4 or more take out places with different food styles that are nearby and who will deliver to the pub.  I typically do not drink without also eating and not having any food, made me stop at one emergency LAGER that was not even close to a Pils.
I am attaching a photo of a beautiful PILS with stiff foam on top...</Text>< pics>

{'time': 1628281556285, 'text': 'H.O. Schweizer, thank you for your detailed review and feedback. First, I want to mention that we do not actually brew the beer that we carry; but rather, we partner with the best breweries around that we can find. Our goal is to have our community fall in love with the amazing, small, independent, craft breweries that we adore ourselves. We try our best to always offer a variety of styles to cater to everyone\'s unique palates and preferences. With that said, we are subject to offering what is made available to us by our brewery partners.\nWhile our taplist rotates daily, it appears at the time of this post that we have 2 light lagers and 1 light ale available on draft (and many more options in cans). At this time, we are currently featuring a dry hopped pilsner lager from Barebottle in San Francisco, a German style Helles lager from Humble Sea in Santa Cruz, and a delicious German style Kolsch ale (light & crisp) from Moksa in Rocklin. Hopefully, one of these 3 lighter styles would satisfy your preference. I would also HIGHLY recommend asking the bartender to do a "slow pour" on any of these 3 beers to properly allow for the aromatics and head to develop.\nLastly, I do want to point out that we do offer a variety of food options for you to munch on. We have a few different fresh made Argentinean empanadas and flatbread pizzas to choose from. To supplement our hot food offering, we also have a variety of chips, peanuts, beef jerky, and pork rinds. Lastly, we always welcome outside food and have a few different menus from our neighbors to browse.\nAgain, we appreciate your feedback and hope to see you again soon.'}< /resp>

If you are old enough to remember the show "Cheers" then you remember the theme song "...where everybody knows your name, and their always glad to came." Well...that sums up Stacks. Good food and better people. Manager Monica welcomes you with a friendly greeting. Your server is knowledgeable and attentive. The cooks do their thing in the back and you leave feeling full in body and spirit. Always on the top of my recommendations when people ask where they can find a good breakfast joint!< /review>

Good food, excellent service. They are only serving outside and have distanced tables, many with umbrellas.  The food was well prepared. We went back again the next day. Our server the first day was excellent, the second time not quite as good but certainly acceptable.  I had the crab omelette the first time. I’m picky about crab and it was actually fresh as stated. It’s red crab. Not fishy at all. Has a lot of ingredients in there. You could probably share this dish, especially as it comes with a full sized bagel. My companion enjoyed his egg dish. I had eggs Benedict Florentine the second day. Muffin could have a little more toasting so it doesn’t get soggy quickly but the rest was delicious. My companion was happy with his chicken fried steak.< /text>

All American breakfasts and lunch. Pancakes are excellent though. Highly recommend you try those. Service was good. They came around often to refill drinks. Pandemic setting arrangements right now so outside table was a little cool in the shade. Not their fault.</text>

My friend and I had breakfast at Stacks today.   We both had the Farmer's Breakfast which had 2 eggs,  2 slices of bacon, 2 breakfast sausages, hashbrowns and 2 pancakes.   The sausages were the best I ever had.   The whole meal was delicious!  We did have a long wait but it was well worth it.< /text>

<text>This place is a classic and one of Campbell's finest. Most of the times I've been here there has been a wait. However, the last two times there was no wait. Both times were weekday mornings. Regardless, the server has always been friendly and attentive. I got the bacon and onion skillet with fruit. I also ordered one pancake. They are definitely known for their pancakes and have quite a selection. I enjoy looking at all the options and it can be even overwhelming because you want to try everything! Danny got the basic eggs bacon and toast as usual. Instead of toast they offered a bagel which was nice. I have never had a bad experience here and will definitely come here again. Nothing is bad on the menu as well. They have a counter where you can order and sit as well as outside seating. There is plenty of places to park, including street parking and a parking garage.</text><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808e3520a06ab2fb:0xcff27dcc95196da1< /gmap_id><time>1609120482762</time><pictures>None< /pictures>< username>

I came here on a Thursday morning around 8AM and was seated right away. The customer service the previous time we came here wasn't so great but it has definitely improved a lot.

I am in love with the California Benedict, it is honestly a MUST if you ever decide to come here. Of course, you get your two portions of the Benedict, a side of hash, and a mini side of fruits to go with your perfectly well made breakfast.

Since quarantine, I have not been out much but I'm so glad I chose Stacks to be one of the first restaurant I dined out at. Not only is the food great, service was just as excellent. Would definitely recommend!< /review>

The service was enormous but it want also cheap but considering the CoVid, this was all fine. Happy to support the local business who are there for us, right.
So she ordered the steak (not so big in size ...medium well was a little hard though so it'll be better to go medium rare.) the side potatoes were very delicious. I had the meat crepe. It was gigantic ! Very good also. Coffee flowed like a fountain and service was excellent.
I highly recommend Stacks in Campbell. Kudos to our waiter< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Stacks is my go to for traditional Americana Breakfast Satisfaction. We got the Chicken Fried Steak. The crust is crispy with just the right amount of savory salty peppery and sweet crunch smothered in gravy. Their pancakes are even better stacked with butter and sweet maple syrup it is a must finish eating situation. Stacks normally has a line so give yourself some time and enjoy a fulfilling American breakfast.< /Review><Date>1533096787971< /Date>< pics>

The eggs in the omelette were extremely over cooked, and the omelette was topped with cold, unmelted shredded cheese. Lastly, it was topped with 2 thin slices of the worst, mealy tomato I’ve seen in years. I question how any cook could be willing to let such an obviously inedible meal leave their kitchen and actually be served to a customer...</text>< UserId.>

The food was good, alot of cheese on my veggie omelet and on my friends plate. Otherwise, outside dining was all right.  Didn't like no plastic utensils.</review>

Food was great.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and it came with extra gravy on the side which was fantastic. The eggs were a little dry and blah but the rest was yummy.< /review>

Great place for brunch outside when it's sunny - we were here when a farmer's market was on right across the street. The French Toast was A+ and highly recommended. Very friendly staff - not sure if reservations are required, but the place was chock full when we got there around 1pm on a Sunday.<//Text>

5-star service from great staff at this upscale American diner.
Gets crowded quickly, generous portions, reasonable prices especially considering the location.
Despite all perks, the food is in the end mid-level diner food as you pour maple flavored. corn syrup over your flapjacks you lose the 5th star.
But still remains one of the few breakfast options for the area and a good choice for any meal.< /text>

My wife and I ordered take out during the shelter in place order. The staff was super friendly on the phone and answered all of my questions. Ordering and pickup were a breeze. The food was amazing! I made my own omelette and it was great. Their house jam is one of the best I have tasted. 10/10 from me! THANK YOU!<//review>

Once you’re seated, the service is good. It’s usually a wait to get in. The portions are American Sized...big. Very tasty though and a large menu.<//Review>

Stacks,

A family restaurant, with an amazing, friendly and lovely staff. The pancakes are to die for. Fluffy, soft, but still filling. But, lets say you aren't a pancake person and you'd like to try other traditional breakfast (breaky sandwich or hash brown, sausages, etc). Great news, you can also devour them here.

For the price of about $10-20, you can get a pretty phenomenal breakfast.

5/5</Review>

Lot of choices when it comes to pancakes and waffles. My kids loves this place. They get so sugar high, so we take them only for breakfast.
Their fav is oreo stuffed 🥞 😋<//review>

<text>The food is rarely disappointing. The menu selections are abundant and the staff are typically efficient.

Today was not typical.
The restaurant was half full which was pleasant surprise in my opinion. Got seated as soon as we entered.
A number of activities caught my attention away from my delicious meal:
A few instances of customers deciding to relocate to another table a few minutes after being seated, and after touching the silverware and coffee cups. The staff seated other arriving customers without replacing the touched items. YUCK!
I observed a server touching her hair, then scratching her back and then using her bare hands to pick up the bagels from the toaster and using a brush to butter the bagels.
GROSS!
I will point out that I observed all the other servers using gloves or the available tongs to handle the toasted breads, but she (Angelika) was the only one on multiple occasions using her bare hands to handle the bagels and toast.
UNSANITARY!

I’ll make sure to ask for a different server if she approaches my table the next time I visit the restaurant. Probably not anytime soon.<//text><resp>None</resp><user_id>106557097404629832617</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Among the privileges we have living so close to the Salinas Valley is the culinary diversity of herbaceous plants that dot the plates of so many treasures dishes. How Stacks has missed the memo and served a dish consisting all of one color blows my mind. It would have been fine if what was served in front of me was edible — it was not. At least, as edible as eating butter from a jar.

I waited one week to post this review thinking that my feelings about the experience would dissipate. They have not. I remain insulted.

I paid $29 for a bagel with cream cheese. The flavor-less omelette made with powdered eggs was sent straight to the compost bin. The picture attached was the extent of the bite I took before it was pushed away.<//Text>

The food is rarely disappointing. The menu selections are abundant and the staff are typically efficient.

Today was not typical.
The restaurant was half full which was pleasant surprise in my opinion. Got seated as soon as we entered.
A number of activities caught my attention away from my delicious meal:
A few instances of customers deciding to relocate to another table a few minutes after being seated, and after touching the silverware and coffee cups. The staff seated other arriving customers without replacing the touched items. YUCK!
I observed a server touching her hair, then scratching her back and then using her bare hands to pick up the bagels from the toaster and using a brush to butter the bagels.
GROSS!
I will point out that I observed all the other servers using gloves or the available tongs to handle the toasted breads, but she (Angelika) was the only one on multiple occasions using her bare hands to handle the bagels and toast.
UNSANITARY!

I’ll make sure to ask for a different server if she approaches my table the next time I visit the restaurant. Probably not anytime soon.< /review>

I'm probably not the best judge of service since I haven't been to Stacks in over 3 years.  But,  on this single visit,  it was not good.  Both my plate and my wife's has to be returned and redone thrice (yup, 3 times) and my plate was still wrong, and my wife's was unappealing.  Not to mention, we had to wait 20 minutes for an outside table in the heat due to the pandemic restrictions.  Maybe it was just an off day and my bad luck, but I was really hoping for a great birthday breakfast that just failed. However, the plain pancakes were scrumptious so there was  redemption. I'm not giving up on this place. I believe in you, Stacks,  so I'll wait until after the pandemic to try again.< /Text>

From out of town. Tried the chilaquiles, which is one of my favorite breakfast dishes, and safe to say that it was amazing. Great customer service and great environment. Would definitely come back here with a friend for breakfast !< /Review>

Stacks is good.  It's not Grandma's cooking on the farm in Iowa good... But still.  This is a great go to place Saturday and Sunday mornings.  Besides you may run into the same people you saw at Katie Bloom's the previous night ( or rather earlier that same day ).  The wait can be a bit irritating, but I've never had to wait the quoted time.  Apparently some people put in their name and then either wander off or forget that Mike Hunt, while funny, is the name they registered.<//text>

I've been going here for over 10 years and the food is consistently a top spot for breakfast. Unfortunately, the hashbrowns in my open faced breakfast sandwich were cold and tasted old. The male host was rude when we requested an update on our wait time after 45 minutes and when paying for our meal. I don't think the food at Bill's cafe is necessarily better but the customer service is consistently better.<//review>

This was an awesome diner and I will definitely be back, just sadly... not for the lemon pancakes.

What I ordered: I ordered the corned beef hash eggs benedict and a lemon ricotta pancake.

The corned beef hash benedict was insanely good! The beef was falling apart so easily, well seasoned, slightly spicy and mouthwatering. The meat accompanied the poached eggs well with an nice creamy balance of flavors. Highly recommend this item. However, the lemon ricotta pancake was not that wonderful to me. There were large pieces of the zest in the pancake which I thought was sort of odd. The zest was a bit off putting as it made the pancake a lot more chewy. The raspberry jam/sauce that came with it was very good and helped blend the flavors together however.

Tips: Park down the street, the parking here was taken up fast!

Dislikes: aside from the zest, I have no complaints!< /Text>

For breakfast this is one of our favorite places. Eady access plenty of parking and great food but.....on weekends the wait can be long and the prices went up quite a bit. We were 3 and paid over 50$ for breakfast that is a bit too much. If the value for the money was better I would give it 5 stars but sadly the prices went up too much.< /Review>

Although my huevos rancheros looked promising it was completely tasteless.  Disappointed. The salsa tasted like canned salsa with zero flavor. The rest of the dish was tasteless as well. I asked about the salsa. The waitress never came back. Waited for 15 minutes then gave up and left.< /Text>

Not to be missed if you can go in before 2 pm they offer Breakfast and Lunch.  I still go there when I am in Campbell and even make special plans to go in for Breakfast or Lunch.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>So it was my first encounter with Stacks. The speed of service was amazing. Sat down, ordered, and got my food in less than 20 minutes. However, the potatoes were too heavily seasoned, the orange juice was old and lifeless, and the prices were too expensive for a simple meal. Service was great though and if you enjoy being in downtown Campbell it's not a bad spot to check out.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place is your best choice when it comes to branching in Silicon Valley! It was quite a while when I last dined here, but nothing changed since than. Super great food and extremely helpful staff!

We came in a group of 4 with a baby, and despite the confusion at the front desk (somebody’s taken our place in the queue) we were offered a table, and then we decided to change the table for one more comfortable with the baby 👶). It was a pleasant experience throughout, and the service was impeccable.

I ordered an Egg Benedict with ham and spinach, and I loved it. Food preparation is super swift considering the number of visitors!

What is also pleasant is that the restaurant gives away free coffee ☕️, it was available for free to each member of the community. I think, it’s done on purpose for the Sunday farmers market.

Thank you for this wonderful experience, Stacks! I m your devoted fan!< /Text>

We have been here several times and the food is always excellent. The staff is always very attentive and friendly. They have complimentary coffee, tea, and water for those that are on the waitlist. It is a nice location in downtown Campbell with many shops within walking distance. If you are there on a Sunday the Campbell farmers market is right next to it.<//Text>

Came with my girlfriend and dog on a warm day in the middle of the afternoon. No one was sitting outside so we asked the hostess if we could sit outside. She was very polite and told us to find a table and someone would be out to bring us menus. Picked a table since no one else was sitting outside. 10 minutes...20 minutes...no one comes out. They pretty much completely forgot about us. Never even got a chance to try the food after hearing about it from my girlfriend. It wasn't like they were packed inside, it was a regular weekday afternoon. No one brought water, table settings, nothing.  So I cracked open the front door and told the nice girl at the front that we waited over 20 minutes and that we were leaving. We walked down the street on that lovely day and enjoyed a nice lunch at Sushi Confidential. They earned my money that day. Stacks forgot about us. 🤷‍♂️< /Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>They forgot my Crab Benedict this morning at breakfast. We had to ask another server to check on it. Nobody came back to the table to let us know if it was being made or not. Everyone else in my party had finished their food and we were waiting for the check when a third server finally brought it out. I informed our server of the situation and she told me that Benedict’s take longer because they have to use a different griddle to poach the eggs on and that’s just how it goes on Sunday’s. If this is the way the Stack’s kitchen operates, I wish that expectation had been conveyed when I ordered it, not 30 minutes after the rest of our table had been served. Our server boxed it up and charged me half price for it. This was a $20 meal that I ordered to enjoy with my family AT the restaurant, not to take home soggy. Really disappointed in the way this was handled today and the unapologetic response I received from the service staff. Will not be returning after this incident.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

It has a diner kind of feel with upgraded food. Decent (not out of this world) and fresh coffee that at least doesn't upset your stomach. Lots of options including  healthy. And outdoor seating!< /Text>

They messed up my order, and I sat a long time watching the rest of my family eat while they sorted out their mistake. The food was fine, but for the disappointing dining experience, I would have appreciated some kind of gesture, like marking off my dish, or at least comping my drink on the bill.< /text>

I came to eat here with my family, and they actually really loved the food. It was really pleasant in there, and we sat for a good few hours. However...our waitress wasn't the most attentive. There was like a good 30 minutes we had no idea where she was and all the other waiters were busy which got frustrating. Other than that, i will be coming here again on a less busy day.</text>

From out of town. Tried the chilaquiles, which is one of my favorite breakfast dishes, and safe to say that it was amazing. Great customer service and great environment. Would definitely come back here with a friend for breakfast !</text>

Great place in downtown Campbell for breakfast and lunch. Be prepared to wait for a table, but it usually goes fairly quickly. Was there on Sunday and our server was quick and very personable. Food was great, fresh veggies in the omelet and fresh fruit on the side. Would recommend highly.<//Text>

Bacon waffles with fresh juice and some raspberry and lemon pancake thing I split with my friend. If I had any complaint at all, it was that it was a 45 minute wait as I went on a Sunday. Besides being a popular day to be hung over or take family to breakfast before church or something...farmers market happens on Sundays. They put out tea and coffee for everyone waiting outside so, can't really blame them for anything. Just too many people here.<//text>

<text>Three mistakes occurred here:
1. There was a 10 minute delay in between delivery of the first meal and last meal at the table
2. My friends lox scramble was missing lox and cream cheese
3. My friends ham and cheese omelette was missing ham

Overall the food was mediocre in quality and the service was poor. Breakfast among all four of us after taking off 1 meal still cost $65. I would not recommend eating here.< /text>< Rate>

< Review>
Had to wait 45 minutes with a reservation. Was good food and worth the wait, but I'm from Tennessee where a single waffle, no potatoes, no egg, no meat, no drink, nothing but a waffle on a plate doesn't cost $12.50 before tax and tip. $2 an egg?? I raise chickens and have my own eggs and milk. Hell, I sell eggs at $2/dozen. This one plate cost over $20, but where I come from it's only $3 or less. Last time I visit your freaky expensive corrupt state.</Review>

Always a fun place for breakfast or lunch.  The crab melt is the best I've had.  The side salad that comes with several items is unique and tasty.  The only downside of this place is that the wait can be quite lengthy if you go early.  Love this place!< /text>

<Review>After living in downtown Campbell for more than a year, we finally made it to Stacks. Had a fabulous brunch sitting outside at one of the sidewalk tables on a beautiful sunny day.

Food was good, the wait wasn't long and the service was good.

Kinda wish now we had gone earlier! We will be back.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808e3520a06ab2fb:0xcff27dcc95196da1< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>Good food and fast service. I'm from out of town, and ate at Stacks once before years ago. I had the hash, which is good, but the money is best spent on the eponymous 'stacks' of pancakes. I would venture to guess the French toast is great too. Definitely worth the time!</Review><gmapID>0x808e3520a06ab2fb:0xcff27dcc95196da1</gmapID>< Date>

Don’t bother, really.  After reading a few reviews I was pretty excited by the pictures and the reviews to come here.  Once we got here it was pretty packed - another promising sign.  From there everything went down.  My first clue was the orange juice and coffee were both bad.  In a breakfast place if you can’t get the basics right that’s not a good sign.  I tried to reserve judgment until the food came.  We got Mexican omelette with hash browns and toast and the garden crepes which came with fruit and hash browns.  The fruit and hash browns were mediocre at best.  While the Mexican omelette wasn’t terrible it was generally characteristic of this whole place - a bit of a let down.  Once again, don’t bother, really.<//Text>

<Text>Pleasantly surprised. Their benedict's were very good. Be warned that if your ENTIRE party isn't in the building, you won't be seated. We were waiting for someone to park the car (even though I knew what he wanted to order!) and we had to wait until he was physically "in the building" before being seated. A little annoying< /Text>< username>

Haven't dined there in a while. Menu has changed a little,  prices increased. Seating wait list seemed to be unorganized.  Wanted to sit outside..they said when our name is called they'll ask then.  A minute later an announcement was made that if anyone wanted to sit outside come to the host desk. Really? Told it was a 25 minute wait when we first checked in, waited twice as long. When seated inside, the food took a long time to be delivered.  Waitress said cooks were behind
Very unorganized restaurant , sadly. They have gone downhill.</Review>

The food is delicious with many gluten free items available. No annoying background music to compete with conversation. Friendly wait staff and reasonable​ prices. They specialize in breakfast and are not open for dinner. I went back the next morning for the same item because it was so good. Highly recommend.< /review>

<review>Love this place.  Definitely one of best breakfast in South Bay! Very busy on weekends after 9am but free coffee & tea while you wait is nice.   Pancakes & waffles shine.  A bit pricey though now that so popular.</review><Gmap_id>0x808e3520a06ab2fb:0xcff27dcc95196da1<//Gmap_id><UserId.>100732450358219722496<//UserId.>< date>

The Popeyes omellete was quite good. They leave a pot of coffee at the table along with cream at every table. Another nice touch is the two different types of jam in glass containers at each table. My two peeves are half and half in those plastic shot containers and high fructose corn syrup jam packaged in tiny plastic containers. Going up to the counter to pay takes away from the experience a bit. Would go back again.<//Text>

Fast service, hot food, good selection. Ordered the biscuits and gravy and was satisfied. Biscuit was sever so slightly dry, but the gravy was on point. Coffee was also good. Gets very busy on weekends (of course) so plan accordingly.</text>

Fresh ingredients, tasty and filing.  We've been enjoying great food here since they opened almost 20 years ago (2000?). The menu has expanded with plenty of options for pancakes, waffles, crepes, scrambles, omelettes, combos, etc. If you're not there by 9, plan on a wait but there's plenty of seating and always worth the wait.</Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>I only have good things to say about this place. I'm always looking for a good brunch spot, because it's my absolute favorite meal of the day. But finding a place that serves quality gluten free options is tough! That's why I was pleasantly surprised to find that Stacks has a gluten free menu :D

Of course, I ordered a waffle! And a side of sausages. Funny story... I remembered a few bites in that I forgot to SAY "gluten free." -_-! Then had a miniature panic attack as I flagged down my waitress. Fortunately for me, she had  noticed I was ordering off the gluten free menu and put in the request accordingly. Much gratitude to her for that! Things could have gotten real bad otherwise.

Unfortunately, I ate the waffle before I remembered to take a picture. Oopsy. Obviously, it was delicious.< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>
<response>None< /response><pictures>None</pictures><text>The Popeyes omellete was quite good. They leave a pot of coffee at the table along with cream at every table. Another nice touch is the two different types of jam in glass containers at each table. My two peeves are half and half in those plastic shot containers and high fructose corn syrup jam packaged in tiny plastic containers. Going up to the counter to pay takes away from the experience a bit. Would go back again.</text><date>1564510873888<//date><user_name>Peter B< /user_name>< gmap_id>

Excellent menu selection.  Great service.  On the expensive side.  Accommodated my party of 7 with a 2  hour advance notice without any problems.  As a result, minimal wait time during busy weekend breakfast rush.</Text>

Chilaquiles were well-received as surprisingly authentic. The oatmeal filled the bowl for an appropriately dense breakfast, strikingly able to hold mixed-in banana chunks. Stacks substituted mushrooms for chorizo to turn the huevos rancheros into a tasty and filling vegetarian dish.  Stacks presents consistent food and an upbeat wait staff.  The restaurant is always busy and tables churn.</Review>

Great place for breakfast ,the food is good there are many things to choose from the menu. One nice thing is that each person or table gets their own carafe  for their own coffee. I am new to this place but I am sure to go back again.<//text>

This used to be the breakfast meet up place for me and my friends but not anymore.

Let me start by saying I enjoy coming to Stacks. The food is good. The pancakes are great and the serving sizes are huge. I also enjoy their bagel and lox.

However, today I came here with my friends and we were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait for a table for 4. 45 minutes later after maybe 20 parties are seated, we were told they thought our party was incomplete. However they gave us no indication of that assumption when we checked in.

After one hour of waiting for a table and we told them to forget about it. What was the cherry on top for the experience was the look of shock and annoyance I saw after my friend told them we were leaving.

It's highly unlikely that I will be returning to this location as I was very disappointed. I will be going to and recommending other Stacks locations.</Review>

Loved there waffles and scrambles.  There is a structure with free parking right across the street.  We arrived around 10am on a Friday with no waiting at all.  The speed of service was amazing. The food was served very quickly after we ordered -- no waiting is good!< /review>

<text>This was my first visit back here in about 6-7 years. I used to come here about once or twice a week because they had good food but I guess those days are gone. Our waitress was taking her tinw to get to us, I had a bacon avocado omelette that was very overcooked. My hash browns were raw and when they brought me a replacement order, those were also raw. No one ever came to check if the replacement was acceptable and no one came by to refill our drinks. Definitely will not be back and I'm giving an extra star because the manager gave me a discount for the raw potatoes. There are plenty of breakfast places in the area that are able to get things right and it's places like this that are relying on the momentum of years past< /text>< Pictures>

<text>We got lucky and were seated immediately when we arrived at 1pm. Usually this place is crowded all day. This being g our first time, we were so excited to try the food. The Lox Benedict special was AMAZING. Seriously, best breakfast dish I've ever had. The omelet was great but nothing particularly spectacular. Host and waitress were really helpful and made the visit great. We will be back... even of we have to wait!< /text>< userid>

Not only is the wait time for a table long, the wait for food is even longer. I feel bad for the servers and cooks but the service is pretty disapointing. It's obvious that people are spread thin but sitting people at a dirty table, delivering a partial order, not priving syrup or eating utensils, or checking on the satisfaction of the table are all unexceptable.
Less of an issue is their lack of hot sauce but still worth mentioning if you like hot sauce, like I do. Needles to say, I won't be coming back, not with all the other options near by.</text>

I came in with 3 friends and ate during farmer's market, and I had high expectations because the wait was pretty long. Everything we got was pretty average diner food. It definitely wasn't bad, but it wasn't much better than a Denny's either.< /Review>

Today was our 1st time eating @ Stacks and  we all ordered different types of omelettes. Everyone agreed that our omelettes were on the small side compared to other restaurants we've visited, especially for the price.

Stacks flatten their omelettes, whereas places like Bill's Cafe, Hash House, Just Breakfast or Flames.  Their omelettes are similar to a 🌯. Stuffed with all the ingredients.

We don't have big appetites so we usually eat about 1/4 of our omelettes but @ Stacks, we ate more than half.

However, the staff were very friendly and attentive. We arrived around 0930 and we were seated right away but after 10 it was standing room only<//Text>

Really good place for breakfast! Service is great! Little wait time. Food is hot and delicious. Only downside is that it is a little bit expensive, but it will definitely make you stuffed.<//review>

<Text>Nice place.  My wife and I used to enjoy walking downtown and going here almost every weekend when we lived in Campbell.

Food and service are both above average.  Solid breakfast place.  One of the few places I'll order pancakes.

<Review>I don't think the food tasted bad at all, quick service too, but filthy place to sit and enjoy your breakfast. It's more or less just the poor hygiene and the overall discomfort caused by that why I am giving this place no more than a single star. There was a spider hanging on the table we were at. Soap water from dirty dishes all over the floor, and again I am not talking about the kitchen floor, this was right next to our table.  Overall a terrible experience.< /Review><gmapID>0x808e3520a06ab2fb:0xcff27dcc95196da1</gmapID>< Rate>

My sister, our two nieces and I had midweek brunch during their spring break. We shared four delicious meals: Meyer lemon, ricotta cheese and raspberry pancakes; omelette; corned beef hash and eggs; and bagel and lox. The server offered extra plates to help. It's always a treat to include a trip to Stacks when extended family visit!</text>

I love the waffles at stacks, especially the banana pecan (ask for pecans to be baked into the batter rather than just on top) and the blueberry.  And the macadamia pancake takes me back to Hawaii.  Recently I've been watching my carbs so this time I tried the veggie fritata and subbed a green salad for the potatoes and bagel.  It was very good, filling and I didn't feel I needed a nap due to a carb coma!  Glad I can still enjoy stacks in a low carb way!< /review>

Great brunch place as it closes at 2 p.m. One brunch enjoyed was a crab and avocado crepe. The Crepe itself was a bit thick and chewy however, it was stuffed with crabmeat and a large amount of avocado. The other meal enjoyed this morning was a Texas French toast with a fresh fruit compote (the chosen fruit was blueberry). Good coffee with a carafe left on the table and good service as well. Recommend without reservation.</review>

Crisp sides with the right amount of mush under the huge dollop of whipped cream. The Almond caramel style was wonderful. Due to it being so busy so regularly the staff can be kinda short but with the volume they have you really can't blame them. Pay at the counter on the way out, then explore the rest of downtown Campbell after.</review><gmapID>0x808e3520a06ab2fb:0xcff27dcc95196da1< /gmapID><pictures>None</pictures>< Rate>

<text>Environment: super noisy, comfy booths, friendly servers

I don't recommend asking for booth seat which seats 2 people. Guests sit right next to the kitchen.

Kid friendly?: kid menu and high booths available

Gluten and dairy free options: very limited but possible

Their gf plain waffle tastes great. The California spicy veggie omelet, minus the cheese, was yum too! My server knew what meant items are wheat and dairy free. He was kind and courteous in fixing my order when my waffle came with a ball of butter on top. I felt fine after the meal.😁 I definitely will be coming back.<//text><Gmap_id>0x808e3520a06ab2fb:0xcff27dcc95196da1</Gmap_id></record>

My wife and I sat belly up over the weekend and the food and service was great. I highly recommend the crab omelette it is loaded with all the good stuff. The wait wasnt too bad either even when we went at 9:00 am.

<rating>5< /rating><review>I have been eating at Stacks in Campbell for many years now, and they're still my favorite in the bay area! They get very busy on weekend mornings, so get there early.

Anything you order here is an excellent choice, but my favorites are the omelets and the bacon waffle (although I prefer the Log Cabin's bacon waffle, but that's all the way in Tahoe). The hashbrowns are great, the bagels are delicious, and even the coffee is always great tasting!

Highly recommended! My wife, dad, mom, brother, sister-in-law, and all of my friends eat here.< /review><resp>None< /resp>< Pictures>

I was surprisingly underwhelmed the last time I went. Waffles were soggy and soft (even before adding syrup) and service was excruciatingly slow. Overall, not worth the looking wait. I think I'll stick with Bill's and Holder's.<//Text>

Waitress messed up on our orders, eggs benedict was nasty while the eggs weren't even runny, hash browns not even cooked, and the overall price was $60. $5 for a side of sausages.

Trying to pay was ridiculous because there's 3 lines. 1 line for putting your name in, 1 line to try and sit at the counter, and 1 line to pay. Such a cluster F!

<text>This is a well-known restaurant in downtown Campbell featuring a variety of breakfast plates. They have a number of omelets, and other egg dishes, but their specialty is their pancakes.

The food here is good, the service is good, but sometimes there can be a wait, sometimes over 20 minutes. I'd recommend avoiding the outdoor seating if you can... while it seems nice at first glance, the tables are quite dirty, and you're right next to a sidewalk, so the experience outside is not always what you would expect.

Well recommended during nin-busy hours for a very nice breakfast or brunch.</text>< pictures>

Located at the western edge of the weekend Campbell farmer's market, it is busy all morning, but the wait was only about 15 minutes at 9:30 on a Sunday.  Service is efficient,  though prices are a little above average given the average portions. Overall,  nothing wrong, but not particularly memorable.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I usually get the southwest omelette (not sure the exact name but its got sour cream and salsa). As my girlfriend would say "its the business".

<Text>Needed a quick bite to eat prior to coaching soccer at Campbell Community Center. We got in and out perfectly w our fam of 6. Only complaint was the highchair we were given had a broken seatbelt. Safety needs to be a priority for highchairs. My hubs swapped it himself for one that was not broken. We didn't make a fuss about it. Food was perfect!</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808e3520a06ab2fb:0xcff27dcc95196da1<//gmap_id></record>

I usually like this place despite the typical long waits. We made a reservation for noon and checked in early with the ladies in the front. They gave us attitude (tone and eye rolls) and insisted that we wait until everyone was there before seating us. Our whole party came together a few mins before 12, so we asked to be seated. The ladies gave us so much attitude. I couldn't believe it. They claimed the kitchen was backed up so they're not seating us. I saw them seat other people. I think they gave up our table. We were finally seated after 45 mins because we finally got to speak to the manager. We were cool with waiting to order so the kitchen could catch up; instead, we ended up standing for 45mins on top of when we first arrived! It killed the vibe of the birthday brunch. Never coming back. Way too rude, expensive, and overrated.<//Review>

This is definitely my husband's favorite place and me-not so much.  The food is fine, the service is usually above average but, the restaurant is just too squished, crowded, and I swear something smells and not in a good way.  Their food is really good but, I have other breakfast spot favorites in the area I would rather go to.<//Text>

<text>The gluten free waffles are AMAZING. I can say, without any hestitation, that this is the best gf waffle I have ever had. We drove here from San Fran to visit the Winchester House, and I would come back just for the waffles. Celiacs rejoice - breakfast has been reborn. Great service and atmosphere also. Five stars.<//text>< Pics>

This is a pretty popular weekend brunch location despite its lack of variety of alcohol. The wait can get pretty long around lunch time, so plan accordingly. They won't seat you unless the majority of your members are present.

Service was a bit slow, but that's understandable considering their number of customers.

I ordered their Eggs Benedict, which came with deliciously buttery potatoes but slightly old and salty hams. Eggs Benedict itself was quite juicy.

Overall, it wasn't a bad meal, but nothing out of the extraordinary. I still prefer Opa 2 blocks down.<//text>

< Review>
In the 2 times I have been to this restaurant it was NOT my choice but the choice of my friends.

$7.25 for 2 smallish sized pancakes, seriously ??   What are they made of, rare grains that you had to go to the top of Mt Everest to harvest ??   Or maybe strains of Gold or other valuable metals ??  Then you add tax to that and want a tip too !!           2 pancakes end up costing $9

Or perhaps you think all of us are Millionaires who make so much money that they don't care about breakfast ending costing over $50

Honestly you are too over priced and you're not much better than Denny's.

Complete rip off.    Utter GREED.<//Review>

The food was good but I believe that it was a little bit over price. My server was ok. I know that we are trying to save water, so they don't server it unless you ask for it. She told us that she only going to serve water to whoever want it because she going to a fine if water is being waste. Really? Over all, it was good but I dont know if I want to go back there because the place was small and I guest they can over charge because its in Campbell.< /text>

The food is really tasty, and I enjoyed eating on the sidewalk and watching the crowd go by.  But, it is crowded on weekend mornings.  I would suggest a reservation for a group over 5.<//Text>

First, my and my friend (two person party) weren't quite ready to order when our waitress came to our table, so we asked for a minute more. She came back about 20 minutes later after no one checking on us. We both got orange juice and could immediately tell it was made from concentrate, which I personally don't mind as long as it's good, which it was not. I ordered the eggs benedict, which we're honestly so disappointing. One of the eggs was popped and they served it to me like that! If I had a restaurant I would NEVER even consider serving someone a poached egg that had been POPPED! My meal also came with a fruit cup that you could tell had been sitting out for hours, as all the fruit exposed on top was extremely dry, I'm sure bugs had been crawling on it too. The biscuits for my eggs benedict was hard and dry and difficult to even cut through with a knife. Our waitress checked on us I believe once throughout our entire meal too.</Text>

Avoid it.. Save yourself the experience and just go to has Hash House on Hamilton.

Here's why: rude service . . . by everyone, horrible fruit sides, food was only mediocre.  We won't be back, ever.<//Text>

Since we opened our Campbell location 17 years ago, we have greatly appreciated customer feedback especially in real time so we can respond quickly.

< Review>
Can't believe chicken fried steak has a staff favorite mark!? The chicken crust was soggy, the gravy was cold and with little mushroom, the meat was processed chicken, not real and way too salty... Bad quality food, high price, and 40-min wait to be seated, 15-min to settle the payment... I will not come back!</Review>

<text>I've been here 3 or 4 times and I think this place is average. I have some friends who like it, but I haven't found anything special here.

< review>
Bad service, waitress started yelling at us for standing next to a table not sitting standing even though another waitress told us to wait next to the table my cousin left the restaurant, even though he is disabled he also stood up and waited but at the end he left, if your all about food service then this restaurant is not for you.< /review>

(Translated by Google) I went with my friend because I like cute Campbell. I'm so glad that I've been to a good restaurant in this area for a long time.
I liked the kind staff and the delicious menu. It felt much better and healthier than the menu that was just pretty and tasteless.
I ordered an omelette and it was delicious, the hash brown didn't have much salt, so I could give it to my baby.
I decided to go there again with my friend because I want to go there again!

I liked the cute Campbell so I went with my friend. It was so nice to have been to the local restaurants. I loved the friendly staff and the delicious menu.
It was much better than pretty and tasteless menus, and it was a healthy feeling.
I ordered an omelet and it was delicious and the hash brown didn't contain much salt so I could give it to my baby. I wanted to go again and decided to go back with my friend!

아기자기한 캠벨을 좋아해서 친구랑 같이 다녀왔습니다. 이 지역의 오랜 맛집을 잘 다녀와서 너무 좋았어요. 친절한 직원들과 맛있는 메뉴가 맘에 들었어요.
마냥 예쁘기만하고 맛없는 메뉴들보다 훨씬 좋고, 건강한 느낌이었습니다.
저는 오믈렛을 주문했는데 맛있었고, 해시브라운도 소금이 많이 들어가지 않아서 내 아기에게 줄 수 있었어요. 또 가고싶은 곳이라서 친구랑 다시 가기로했습니다!< /Review>
