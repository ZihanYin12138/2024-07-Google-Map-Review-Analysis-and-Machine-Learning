She always greets me with a smile and very accommodating. I place orders and it's a 2-3 turn around. I've been shopping here for many, many years. They have a great line of wigs and other beauty supplies to choose from. If she doesn't have it, she'll get it!<//text>

Probably the nicest and most cordial beauty supply store I've ever been to in the U.S...and I've lived in a few states. The owners greeted me with a, "good morning" and asked if I needed any help.

They also had a large selection of weaves, wigs, braiding hair and what not. Will definitely be coming back.<//text>

Very kind staff. I was able to try on wigs without anyone standing on my neck. They were very helpful and kind. You can find wigs minimal for $20 . They don’t go lower than that.You have good options but it is a limited selection.</Review>

I've been going to this beauty supply since middle school, I'm 28 now and it's still my go to for everything . The women that work there are great. I've never had any issues with them. Always friendly and willing to help. There is a man that's there every now and then, he's a little strange.<//Review>

<review>Easy to navigate. Pretty decent selection and found what I was looking for in seconds. The only downside is that staff doesn't seem that knowledgable on products. I asked for an opinion and what a best seller was amongst a few of the edge contrl products, and she wasn't able to give me an answer. That goodness for technology and I could call a friend.</review>< name>

<response>None<//response><text>It's  okay if you're not black in this store, period. I got followed around the store, kept getting asked irrelevant questions while I'm browsing for hair supplies , pushy, aggressive, rude salesman and saleswoman. You don't have to worry about me coming back, you won't ever receive one cent of mine. I advise all my people of color steer clear of this place. You'll be subjected to an uninviting experience. Not worth the hassle unless you like being harassed.< /text></record>

If you are going to spend money outside of the community they are very nice people. At least I've had nothing but positive interactions, I've never witnessed or experienced the bad treatment some have.  Its a very typical beauty supply catering to "black" hair.< /review>

<review>Horrible company.  Show up at noon sit in check in office for over an hour.  Not a soul insight,  NO SIGN or anytging that states they have a lunch break.  Just complete BS.  Not serious conpany at all.  Definetly will be avoiding pickups from here moving forward.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Pittman Farms of California is the supplier of Whole Foods and is the purchaser of Norbest.  The condition of the farms are so shockingly bad.  They are abusive and animals are raised in such a filthy condition (turkey newspaper report in large Utah paper).  I will not buy any poultry or any animal products that comes from any of these farms in Whole Foods anymore.  I will be complaining of the poor choice in meat vendor Whole Foods has opted to use, to them and I will pass the word around to everyone that purchases these products in Whole Foods too.  I’m sure Whole Foods will do the right thing and choose those vendors that truly abide to the humane and organic methods that you think of when you hear the grocer name of Whole Foods.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

It took me a while to find a locksmith not connected to a call center. But I'm glad I did, because they are fast and skilled at what they do. They didn't overcharge me. I'm really happy to have taken my car here and absolutely recommend them.<//Review>

<review>THIS PLACE IS A TRUE LIFE SAVER! I was quoted $500+ at the VW dealership to get a spare key made... these guys over at JP LOCKSMITH did it for over half the price and were able to help me right away. The guys working are quick, efficient and knowledgeable. And there’s a warranty if something goes wrong with the key. I’m so happy I found this place. Seriously if you need a spare key don’t waste your money at a dealership, come here!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlW4Mw4UVuZEAafakc3P9F6dCitB6lnyCp_OLV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I was informed after sitting at the Subaru dealership for nearly three hours that it would take 3 business days and $471 to get a copy of my key made.

After a minor meltdown looking at the quote, I got sent down the street to JP instead, and 10 minutes later I walked out with the key, accurately cut and programmed, in hand.

I’m not trying to lose my keys again, but if I do, I’ll be back. THANK YOU!</Review>

I locked my key in my Jeep Wrangler today. I called road side assistance to try to unlock my car but they were not able to do it. They recommended I call a locksmith to get another key made. I found JP Locksmith here on Google. He went above and beyond to help me get my Jeep unlocked. It was so stressful dealing with it, but he was very polite and professional. I highly recommend going to him over going to your cars dealership to have a key made. Thank you for your time JP!<//text>

<text>JP Locksmith is the place to go! They provide fast, reliable service for even the toughest of vehicles.

This guy is crazy, he wanted to charge me $40 to cut 2 blank keys I had brought in. If you had to program the keys fine but these keys did not have a chip. Got my keys cut at Kokos locksmith in Glendale for $5 each. Save your self some money and go to a different locksmith.</text>

<text>I want to give this place 5 stars. I lost my keys to my Aston Martin and had ordered them uncut. JP locksmith took care of everything for me. They actually gave me an exact same key I ordered from the dealer for a way cheaper price so that I can return the original one which cost me $200. JP knows every cars and he has lots of experience. I definitely would recommend to everyone. Thanks again JP! I give you two thumbs up!!!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Very fast and good in copying the key of my car. The price was alright but more expensive than I expected. The work was done correctly and in 10 minutes.</Text>

So impressed and fortunate to have Joseph from JP Locksmith take care of our needs.  Joseph is quick to respond (within 30 mins) and arrived at the house to supply and program new fobs.  Not only was he quick, but very professional, and has high expertise in auto mechanics, but also his prices were very reasonable compared to same service from nearby locksmiths. Joseph has great knowledge and expertise in working on autos.  He found a problem with my car, and returned to repair it after work without charging extra- really incredible!  He is truly amazing, does fine work, and is honest, not to mention his keen knowledge on auto mechanics.   Thank you so very much, Joseph!< /Review>

< Review>
Lost my keys, Toyota dealership wanted to racket me, this guys made me two keys for a decent price...
Full story : I thought the dealership were there to service their clients, I guess I was wrong ! They wanted to charge me $250 for the key AND $300 for programming it. Let’s be real here, the cost of the key is probably $1 for the dealership that buy it in bulk. Let say $10 to be conservative. So they’re making over $500 profit for a 30 min job !
The locksmith I’m sure have to pay more for the part and manage to charge half and make a comfortable living... I love Toyota but this leave me a sour taste !
Next car will be a Tesla :)< /Review>

FANTASTIC!
My daughter needed spare keys for here recently purchased pre-owned nissan. Car seller gave her programmed blanks. We just needed them cut.
No one else would help us. JPLocksmith not only cut the keys, but also gave us code.
Thank you! No need to go anywhere else. Amazing deal too!<//Review>

This place is awesome. The Subaru dealership quoted me at $240 and he did the same job faster for $150. I never write reviews but this guy is great!</Review>

<Review>I called 6 places in LA that couldn't make a duplicate key for my car (cut and program) till thankfully I called JP, he took me in right away, made it very quickly and still gave a better deal than any of the other places would have. It was such a pleasure. Seriously don't waste your time anywhere else this is the place to go< /Review>< rate>

Go here if you need a new key fob and want to avoid paying dealer prices ! Joseph was quick to call me back and even traveled to my inoperable car to assess the problem and gave me options according to my budget. He was friendly, professional, and fast and a fraction of the price that the dealers had quoted. His price included the key cut, transponder and programming. I Highly recommend him!</Text>

Joseph was immediately super helpful and knowledgeable. He didn't have the exact key I needed since I drive a car not normally sold in California but he quickly ordered it and soon I was able to drive my car without using the manual key. He even fixed a nagging issue with my old remote key free of charge. Highly recommended.</Text>

I drove from Redondo Beach to south San Diego to have a key cut and remote programmed at The Key Crew.  On my way there, I received a telephone call to reschedule my visit. I replied that I could not as I was already en route. Their prices were very high but, albeit, lower than the dealer. It took an inordinate amount of time over two hours to address my issues and even then, it was not fully addressed because my remote which was "certified" for the car year in question could not be programmed. Moreover I sensed that the locksmith work load was back up and he did not want to spend more time trying to resolve the apparent issue. The key, using my own blank, cost $150.

On my return to LA, in exasperation, I began to look about for an entity to program my remote. I found one in Glendale, CA, JP Locksmith (Automotive Specialist). I spoke to the owner and we agreed on a price to program the remote. I said I would bring the car in next week. This gave me an opportunity to research other sources in the meantime. In our conversation, he mentioned that he was open until 8:00 PM. His Internet info. said he closed at 6:00 PM. I then called him back to double check his closing time. It was 8: o'clock. I then decided to brave the downtown LA peak hour traffic and drive to Glendale.

He immediately concluded that the battery in my new remote was probably defective. He pointed out an issue with my remote and decided to use a stock remote he had. It worked immediately. He tested it and had me test it, too. All done in 10 to 15 mins. I tried to negotiate his price but he would not budge because he had thrown in his own remote at no cost above the original quote.  Who can blame him for that.

The Key Cut Crew charges $114. for a $10 remote.

JP Locksmith used a common sense approach to pricing. The need for them  to make a living and the need for the customer to feel that pricing is commensurate with a garage hourly rate for specialist knowledge plus parts and, thus, what is reasonable for the job.

All I can say is that JP Locksmith did a remarkable job. They earned every penny they charged. How could I not give them a five star rating.</Review>

I had one mechanic before try to charge me to diagnose a basic electrical issue involving my keys without even fixing it, but this guy...he was knowledgeable, on time, knew his stuff, and cut me a great deal and literally fixed my finicky 2001 Volkswagen that wouldn't start and reprogrammed my keys in 10 minutes .  Call this dude!  The VW dealership told me I'd have to get it towed and then pay over a hundred dollars to get the system back in order.  JP came right to my driveway on a Saturday and saved me hundreds of dollars in towing and VW dealer BS.  Thanks JP Locksmith!!!!</Review>

I went there to get a deep tissue massage. I felt so good after masseuse worked on my upper back she really focus on my knots and also stretching my legs. They offered Champagne, mimosa, orange juice for welcome drinks and cold pressed juice or fresh coconut after the service. I felt so relax with the music and good atmosphere. Will definitely come back here again :)</Text>

I got the massage from the male there. (Don't remember his name). I asked for a Swedish massage and medium pressure for the purpose of relaxing. There were painful moments during that massage and not what I consider relaxing. I'm more sore today than I have been from deep tissue massages. I actually thought I would have a bruise afterward. I get it, there's definitely a knot in my upper left back but you didn't have to spend 15 min grinding into it with all your might. Imagine if I asked for hard or deep pressure! That would be horrible. Okay so beyond that back portion of the massage it was okay. But honestly will not come back to this place. I feel like I need another massage to help relax from that one<//Text>

Quite possibly the best massage I've had in my life! The staff were very kind and they even provide complimentary drinks both before and after the massage. Can't recommend this place enough!</Text>

They offered Champagne, mimosa, orange juice for welcome drinks and cold pressed juice or fresh coconut after the service. I felt so relax with the music and good atmosphere. Will definitely come back here again :)</Text>< pictures>

<rating>2</rating><text>I got the massage from the male there. (Don't remember his name). I asked for a Swedish massage and medium pressure for the purpose of relaxing. There were painful moments during that massage and not what I consider relaxing. I'm more sore today than I have been from deep tissue massages. I actually thought I would have a bruise afterward. I get it, there's definitely a knot in my upper left back but you didn't have to spend 15 min grinding into it with all your might. Imagine if I asked for hard or deep pressure! That would be horrible. Okay so beyond that back portion of the massage it was okay. But honestly will not come back to this place. I feel like I need another massage to help relax from that one</text>< Pics>

We went for the first time, and were pleased with everything.  We spend a few hours between the dry sauna, steam room, hot soak pool and cold pool. They provided plenty of refreshing lemon or cucumber water.  We had a very relaxing time and inexpensive.  We would defiantly come back again.< /review>

Great couple's swedish massage! They gave us free mimosas and treats while they prepared the room.

Both masseuses were very professional, adjusted to our pressure needs, and were very pleasant to be with. Can't wait to go back.< /text>

<review>Photo: Expectation Vs Reality. 1/20/20 @1:40pm. They wouldnt give me a refund on this crunchwrap. Is it just me or is there no meat in this? False advertising. She told me that was the correct portion and the problem is other people give out more then they are suppose to but for inventory purposes this is the correct way to make a crunchwrap.... what do you think? I wont be returning and I love tacobell. So disappointed.<//review>< GmapID>

<text>I went there because for once I noticed the drive-thru did not have a line blocking the traffic areas at the Portola shopping Center and which is quite inconvenient you cannot get around the shopping center with their line so I went there with no line I ordered the taco box with like 12 tacos in it the tacos were very bad they had not enough meat mostly lettuce they were cold when I got them and the weight wasn't very long because I was the only person but I was just satisfied with the product the employee was very nice and friendly at the window but the product was not very good it was mostly tortilla and lettuce there was nothing else in it I mean you might get a teaspoon of meat in it for the price of $18 so I suggest they lower their prices or you don't order something like that even on a slow day< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

This place is horrible. I am at 17 different occasions of orders prepared wrong. They will mess it up on in person orders 8 or of 10 times and every Postmates order will be horrendously wrong. They double check nothing and if they weren’t so close I would never go to them. Now I never will not matter what. Don’t eat here. Go to one with actual customer service<//text>

I don't usually stop at fast food Restaurants but I had some workers at my house doing some yard remodeling. I decided to stop and pick up some food and some cold drinks. I ordered the family box of 6 tacos and 6 burritos. I also got sodas and fries. The workers were supprised and very happy that I brought back food for everyone. I must say the soft tacos were very tasty. We all took a break for lunch and then got back to work. The guys did a great job on my yard and they all thanked me for the food.<//Text>

It’s a really nice place and has a lot of nice people working there. The food is good, but the cheese tastes like plastic, but that’s just fast food so I can’t complain. Lucky for me I don’t like cheese, so I never have to eat it here. If you like cheese, that’s ok, but then you will have to eat the cheese here. I do not recommend that. Because the cheese there is not good. I already said that. You are probably thinking this review is pretty pointless, and your probably right. In conclusion the service is really good here, and it’s up to your discretion wether you like the food or not. 5/5 would recommend. In fact I’m recommending it now, to you, the viewer.<//Text>

My friends and I like to call this particular location the "hipster taco bell", it's unusually clean and kept up compared to most other locations. The staff is very kind and often leave mints in your to go order. Food always feels fresh here too, the quality overall is very high. I highly recommend this location.  :)< /Text>

The restaurant is clean, the staff is polite and friendly, my order came up fast & exactly how I asked for it (extra sauce, no sour cream, etc.). My drink was ice cold, perfect amount of ice, wasn't lacking in syrup or watered down....I was perfectly happy! Other fast food establishments should look to Taco Bell as an example! Keep up the good work guys!<//review>

They frito burrito is quite cheap , filling , albeit a bit gassy on the backend . The baja blast is very cool and tasty during hot weather,  it will cause a mind splitting headache if consumed too quickly .<//text>< pics>

<Review>Tonight I had a bad experience trying to buy on the drive thru. I waited for half an hour and the cars in front of me did not move at all. I really don't know what was going on.  I finally decided to horn to see if the cars behind my car would move and let me back up and leave. Luckily they understood my frustration and they back up and left as well. Unbelievable. I don't think I will ever go back to this particular taco bell.<//Review>< rating>

Wish i could give zero stars but they force you to give one. Youre welcome for the star. Who ever owns this store should be ashamed of their management. But its okay i guess. This location doesnt care about the quality of customer service. The employees care about that 20min gap (before closing) of making sure they close their doors and windows so they can leave early. I have worked in customer service for over 10 years. I also am a business major. If theres one thing i know, its best business practices. Your priority is customers, it is NOT getting off work 20min beofre your scheduled to. This is a reacurring problem at this place. Over and over again we run into the same problem and its only at this location. I used to like taco bell... now im ashamed to say i did. Bummer....< /Text>

Laura and her daughter were very helpful through the whole process. This place is beautiful inside and out in a very quiet area. We were very pleased with everything here all our guest loved the location and service as well. They offer different packages for your event. When we have another event we are definitely coming this way again. Call them for your next event they do an amazing job.</Review>< Pictures>

Beautiful place, I went to a wedding there and I loved how we can have both the ceremony and the reception in the same place. It's clean and very well taken care of. The bathrooms are clean and people are constantly checking to see if there is toilet paper or paper towels. It's in the middle of nowhere so we can make as much noise as we want without being bothered.</text>

(Translated by Google) Excellent place for any family event you have, very good service and accessibility of the people in charge of the place, with areas for children outside, a closed place and with protection. It also has a room as dressing room for people who rent the room, changing clothes. In addition to having a large lot for parking of the cars of the guests.

(Original)
Excelente lugar para cualquier evento familiar que se tenga, muy buen servicio y accesibilidad de las personas encargadas del lugar, con áreas para niños afuera, un lugar cerrado y con protección. También cuenta con un cuarto cómo camerino para las personas que rentan el salón, pasa cambiarse el vestuario. Además de contar con un terreno grande para estacionamiento de los carros de los invitados.</review>

(Translated by Google) Nice place. But the package you have with the person in charge of the cerenonia is not the best, I arrive an hour late and that caused a lot of inconvenience.

Not great. The chair was nice but they didn't ask if I wanted anything extra (most places give you the chart of different packages). Once I got home I noticed she flooded my cuticles on my toenails. I will not be back :(< /Review>

<text>I'm in heaven …. and I love this nail salon. The massage and everything here was on point plus. They have informative about nails job! and I like that they take the time to remove the polish carefully. Everything was immaculate, the decor was lovely as well. I will definitely be back to see her on a regular basis. But no disappointed.< /text><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I made my appointment a couple days ago and arrived 10 minutes late, but Hair & Nails Today acted really professionally. They were all friendly and very professional and did a fabulous job! I would totally come back here to do my nails<//Text>< Pictures>

I finally found a place I absolutely LOVE. I went in with a picture I found on yelp and explained what I wanted for. They're very sharp witted in their color. And they made sure took pride in their nails scarf! They have made a loyal customer out of me. And my experience here was well worth.< /review>

Amazing! It was the best spa pedicure I have ever received. The facility is very nice and relaxing. I tried the hot stone massage and parafin wax along with my pedicure. It was wonderful. Highly recommend.</Text>

I cannot figure out for the life of me why Hair & Nails Today has such low ratings! I've been going there for at least five years and I've consistently received excellent service! I've witnessed how the salon functions over the years and everyone gets excellent service there! Plus the ladies are all super sweet and they work together extremely well!</review>

<Review>I needed a place near work to have a pedi and mani. Hair & Nails Today was open and they signed me in right away. They were friendly, offered me something to drink and even helped me pick out a great color to wear at a wedding I was going to. The prices were fair and they made my short nails look fabulous. I definitely recommend them for quick, quality service.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I think I found my go-to nail salon! Not only are they knowledgeable in their craft but are also extremely welcoming and sweet. The first time I came, I got a basic gel mani and it lasted for 3 weeks! Thank you very much ! I will definitely be back and already have an appointment setup to go back and get a gel manicure!</Text>

This is my go to spot now. I've been going to May for almost 4years, and every time I have had 110% service with her. Great work, and great prices! The ladies here are nice, and precise, and fast. They even stayed open a lil later a cpl times bc I was running behind at work which I am so grateful for. :)<//Review>

If u want a good pedicure for a very reasonable price Lee is your lady, she is extremely good. I've never ever had such a good job on pedicure before I met Lee. Yes there is a wait most of the time but Lee is worth all the wait. She is my favorite lady.</Text>

<Review>I really enjoy having Dr. Hopkins as my eye physician. Her professionalism and thorough examination, gives me great confidence every time I go to her. One of her greatest attribute is that she really listens and documents what you’ve said about your eyes any challenges or difficulties that you’ve had in the past year. She also takes a great deal of care and understanding your about professional and personal wants/wishes for contacts or stylish, professional eyeglasses...let me rephrase that fashionable eyeglasses.

Over the past three years I’ve had two different insurance companies, and she has taken both of those insurance for my examination as well as my lenses.<//Review>< pictures>

It’s hard to find an optometrist who takes time with patients these days, but Dr. Hopkins is fantastic. She helped me find a new contact lens that stays put (I have an astigmatism). The staff is also great. Very cordial and helpful. Offices were super clean before the pandemic and of course are super clean and sanitized between every patient now.</text>

Dr Hopkins is the best Eye Doc around, when I have made appointments there is never a wait, the staff are the most friendliest and knowledgeable group ever. Dr Hopkins is very nice and takes the time to listen to your questions and concerns. I have recommended her to several of my friends<//Text>

<review>Posted closing hours misleading!!!  I called at 5:30pm letting them know I'm on my way to pick up my contacts and will be there 5:45pm.  Receptionist told me they're done with their last patient and are closing, even though, their posted hours state they close at 6pm on Tuesday.  What's the point of your posted hours if you're going to close after your last patient anyway!?  I'm glad I called and didn't drive there for nothing!!!  I'm am really upset they were not willing to stay open for me to pick up my contacts!  Shows how much they care and value their returning patients!!!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Dr Hopkins has been my Optometrist for almost 20 years.  She is pleasant and professional.  Glaucoma runs in my family and she checks for that along with other eye issues to keep my vision sharp.

I am in good hands with her and wouldnt go to anyone else with my sight.  Im an accountant so if I cant see I cant work - I trust her with one of my most valuable assets!  Thanks Dr Hopkins!< /review>< date>

The receptionist was awesome. The doctors were amazing. I have ptsd and was having a bad day and the we’re concerned and friendly and so helpful. The selection of glasses was great and I 100% recommend this office. All the way around fantastic experience. Thank you very much for the sincerity and patience with my situation. Prices are good too I thought I was way out of my price range being in Naples but got A great pair of Costas for 50$. Love you guys. Highly recommend!!!! Thank you very very much for helping me!!!</Text>

Great Dr. with excellent office staff!  Our whole family now goes to Dr Hopkins, and we've all referred others. It is hard not to when everything is so positive: smart & kind Dr who is up on all the best technology, with a staff who makes everything flow smoothly. I know it can be hard to get both together, which is why we appreciate it so much.< /review>

This is a great place to go for all your Optometry needs. The staff are helpful and really go above and beyond. They even readjust my frames for free whenever I need a hand. Very professional and they have state of the art equipment. I highly recommend. Even though I moved a bit further away I still go to them rather than finding someone new.</review>

I was upset when I picked up my glasses and notice before I even put them on were damaged. I remember the receptionist put the glasses that I picked out to the side. I thought those were samples and they would order a new pair. Lady try to adjust my glasses and didn't do a good job and are slipping on my nose and tight on one side and when I left wasn't given a case for my glasses and had to go back to bemind them. Can hardly wait for jim to fix my glasses.  This is Unexcepable service for glasses and being billed close to 860 for glasses.</review>< Pics>

I look forward to seeing Lisa Hopkins every time it is time for my eye exam!  Her examination is thorough, she takes time to listen and answer all of my questions;  the atmosphere in the office is unhurried and professional, and I appreciate Dr. Hopkin's friendly and natural countenance.  Her staff is helpful and knowledgeable and they sincerely care about the details involved in fitting your new glasses perfectly.  I highly recommend her to anyone concerned about their eye care. This post is written my me, Sheila Musselman, wife of Howard Musselman, and as he has the same sentiments as I do regarding Lisa Hopkins, I will leave his name at the top as if he were the one writing the post.<//Review>

I have been going to Dr. Lisa Hopkins for the past 15 years.  She is always up on the newest methods for evaluating eye health.  I had an emergency retinal tear years ago. The office got me in to see her immediately.  It required surgery and Dr. Hopkins quickly made the necessary arrangements for me to see an ophthalmologist that day.

She is a caring competent doctor.  I highly recommend Dr. Hopkins and her caring staff</Text>

My annual examination was timely, friendly, profession and fast but thorough!  At a previous eye company, I was there for 3 hours!!!  With Dr. Lisa Hopkins, I was in and out in 35 minutes!!  Loved it!  Lisa also showed me and explained the retina images in comparison to last year, which thankfully remained at the height of health!</Review>

There are so many reasons I am grateful to have found Dr. Hopkins when my eyesight began changing due to....I will admit, aging. I realized right away that she was thorough, efficient, and personable. I love her clean, modern office and the people who work there. They are always cheerful and helpful. Recently I had trouble with one of my contact lenses and was so relieved that the office was open after 5p.m.  and Dr. Hopkins was able to see me and resolve my issue immediately.<//review>

My wife and I have been patients for years, and enjoy going there for our exams. Only need off-the shelf readers, so no pressure from the staff to buy any glasses.

Highly recommend Dr. Hopkins' office and to pay the extra out-of-pocket (insurance doesn't cover it yet) for the no-dilation exam - when you are done, you walk out and are ready for the day. Nice remodeling of the offices, can't wait to see it finished.   :O)</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Dr Hopkins is very personable and professional. State of the art equipment so for an additional cost there is no dilation. The whole process and results were explained well which was very interesting.

Started seeing Dr. Hopkins when we lived in Long Beach. Now we live 90 miles away, but still make the drive to consult with her on our vision needs. She is friendly, helpful, and able to explain what our prognoses are in easy-to-understand terms.< /Review>

Such a friendly and personable doctor. The office has the latest technology so that the least enjoyable parts of having your eyes examined are that much easier on you.

The office is clean, well-appointed, and everyone who works in it is friendly. I would recommend Dr. Hopkins services to anyone.< /review>

Very professional and thorough eye examination.  Prescription for glasses hit the mark exactly; the glasses she prescribed work well for me in distance, in mid-range (computer), and reading.  I have been going to Dr. Hopkins for many years now, and results are always the best.< /review>

I have been going to Dr. Hopkins for years. She uses all the latest equipment and clearly is current in her medical reading, as she is always aware of what is new in eye disease.  I worry about macular degeneration, and she always remembers and tests me for it. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Hopkins, she's great.  Also, she is always on time, so you need to be too.< /review>

I have used Dr Hopkins for about four years and she is very thorough and professional. Her fees are reasonable and they are not pushy to buy glasses from them.  I bought from elsewhere and from her and their prices are comparable to other specticle suppliers.  Highly recommend her.</Text>

My wife and I have been patients of Dr. Hopkins since she first opened her practice on 2nd Street. We have always been completely satisfied with every aspect of her business. All of the staff handle their duties very professionally. Her selection of frames is great - something for everyone. We do not hesitate to recommend her to our friends.

< Review>
Dr. Hopkins is an absolutely superb Doctor.  She took care of my difficult eye issues for several years before I moved to the East Coast.  I only wish she was here!  She is caring, thorough and really goes the extra mile in her care for her patients.  I can't recommend her more.  You simply will not find anyone better - this is the truth.<//Review>

I wanted to shout out to Ramon for being a great communicator.

I dropped off my 3 series for a water pump issue. Ramon did a great job communicating the progress about my car including an additional radiator issue which caused a delay in delivering the car.

Not only he gave me a peace of mind that my car will be  fully inspected and ready to go when fixed, he also saved me from driving a 2 hour trip in the afternoon traffic.

Great job Ramon and keep up the good work!< /Review>

Kas was very professional and communicated every step of the way. I love it that I only deal with one person now. She checked me in, got me my loaner, called to let me know when my car will be ready, took my payment and checked me out and took my loaner back. Love the new efficient system!< /Review>

<review>We (mainly my wife whom this was for), spent a considerable amount of time researching and comparing vehicles.

Once she found the "one", we evaluated the price, options and location and everything was in-line with our hopes and expectations. An appointment was made, and we received a follow-up call from the Manager shortly before our appointment to ensure that all was in order.

Our experience with Alex and ultimately Steve was great, there was no pressure, and we left that night in a CPO vehicle that looks practically brand new inside and out! A very few touch items were in order, and there was never any question, we just scheduled it with service and they took the best care of us and completed everything without cost or issue.

Well done BMW of Vista!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuBVGRptSNNpnjX1YEw3jUhwbFuGbwOUuXmguu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>{'time': 1619115360160, 'text': "Kevin, thank you for your kind review; we are happy to pass along your comments to the team here at BMW of Vista!

<username>Kyle Souza</username><time>1619647542596</time><Rate>2</Rate><Text>Very disappointing experience with BMW Vista service.  I had an 04 BMW that service was less than stellar at this shop and I thought I would give the Vista store another chance.  The shop is closer to me but the service is not what I expect.  I brought the car in for an oil change and brake fluid change.  There were 2 outstanding recalls on the car.  I did opt to have the recalls completed however I did not understand that comforts I was used to would be "deleted" from the car.  The recall was for the door latches and when that was completed, the electric/power opening feature of the car was removed.
The driver's side door handle does not operate properly but the door was able to open prior to the "power open" feature being removed.
I also wasn't made aware of bushings that needed replacement in the suspension but was made aware of the repair of $1200 for the door handle that isn't working properly.  Shouldn't safety be first?

The tech that performed the service on the car did not respect my vehicle.  Although it is an '06 750li, it should still be treated with care.  The tech must have played the radio for extended periods of time while working on the car as the battery came back almost completely discharged.  It was only at 30% and had been charged to 100% about 4 weeks prior to my service visit.  I could tell that at one point the tech must have had to jump the vehicle to start it as the protective cover from the positive terminal under the hood was removed and not replaced.

The tech must also be unfamiliar with how to service a BMW as when the door panels were removed from the car, the battery was not disconnected and now there is an airbag fault light in the car.

Due to one of the recalls, the programming was removed from the vehicle and the vehicle will have to be reprogrammed.  The windows no longer roll up with the key fob and the trunk no longer closes with the key fob either.  The shop foreman told me that this is not "factory programming" so it couldn't be returned to the car.  This is misinformation as the "loaner" car and another friend's BMW perform the roll up/closing action with the key fob.

The trunk also doesn't open as smoothly as it did prior to bringing it in for service.  The hood struts also appear to be weakened from having the hood open for an extended period of time.

I like not having to work on my own car however I'm not sure I have an alternative given the poor experience from BMW of Vista.

I also expect that my car doesn't receive scratches from getting serviced.

I love my older BMW but do not even like the service provided at BMW of Vista.<//Text>< pics>

Mo was an an outstanding sales rep. It didn’t even seem like he was a sales person at all. It felt more like a friend who was helping me get into the car that was right for me. I went in not really to buy a car, but More so just to browse and see what could be my next car in a few months. He gave such amazing customer service and made me feel comfortable the entire time. He was open to letting me drive any vehicle so I can test the waters on them and see what would best fit my needs. After I found the right one, he went out of his way to pick up the car for me which was the best service ever. I was extremely happy with the service and also purchase of a perfect car. Morgan from finance was also amazing! She was so sweet and kept things moving fairly quickly for me. When I called her a few days later with some questions, she knew exactly who I was and was able to assist immediately. The two combo of people made my experience a wonderful one.<//review>

BMW of Vista provided a great buying experience for myself and my wife.
Jesse A. and Tom M. were the core contributors to that experience. Jesse on the sales side and Tom on the finance side. This is my wife's first BMW and she loves her new car as it has all the features in the car that she was looking for. I am thankful to the team at BMW vista for the experience and especially grateful to both Tom and Jesse, who treated us like family and took care of us really well. Thank you all and keep up the amazing work.<//Review>

Absolutely SUPERB service from start to finish!
Big thank you to WILLIE (client advisor) for all the knowledge and patience in my purchase (FREAKING LOVE MY DRIVES NOW).
THE SALES STAFF was clear and consistent in ensuring I walked out happy.
LOAN PROCESSING was excellent as well!!  At no time did I feel preferred to get this or that.  You took time to explain and compare #s  (not pushy at all!).

This is the best BMW dealership I've been to!</text>

I am So Grateful for how BMW took care of me. Kassandra stayed in touch & relayed my concerns. I live by Riverside. They brought a Gorgeous Loaner car 4 me & took my Vehicle in for service.  BMW went above the call of duty 2 take care of me.
I've told all of my F & F about them.
I will be stopping in on my trips to San Diego to tell them how grateful I am for the care of my Black Beauty I  purchased from them. 🥰🐾❤</review>

Smooth processing, still sanitized premises, great service on car! Cassie was super and took care of everything seamlessly. After the service was done, the car looked beautiful and drove like new (it's a 2005 530i). Definitely worth the extra expense over getting this done outside of the dealership!</review>

I leased a new 430 i two weeks ago and I couldn’t be happier with my car. I previously had a Mercedes, and I’m not sorry  I got a BMW.
The sales staff was great. Alex took me for a test drive and showed me all the options, he was very patient and it was fun driving it.
I came back couple of days later and Ryan helped me chose the car for me and close the deal along with his manager Anthony.
Everybody was so helpful and went the extra mile.
The facility is SUPER CLEAN!
Great experience. I would recommend this dealership to anyone I know !!!!< /text>

Quick and efficient service. Good, large, comfortable waiting area. Non-pushy, helpful staff. The price on my brake fluid flush was on the low end of what I saw online before my visit. The "upsells" or recommended future work during my service visit were all things I already knew about, so no scam attempts here :). Nice job, guys.< /review>

Kassandra was my service representative at Vista BMW and she was friendly, professional and had excellent communication skills. I’m busy at work and Kassandra was kind enough to keep me updated via text messages and photos throughout the day. The work on  my car was completed on time as promised.
I also appreciated that Kassandra was able to work me into the schedule the day I called which I know can be a challenge.</review>

I had the best experience in leasing my X5 with BMW of Vista. Not only did they take my old car off my hands (for above what I owed on it) but they gave me a fantastic deal on my new car! My sales specialist Craig Mayville was so attentive, sweet and patient. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone. Every single person that I’ve had interactions with from sales, to finance, to service has been 5 star!< /review>

I broke down while traveling from out of state and Brian Chartier was my service advisor. He is the best!
Got me in and out and back on the road. He was professional and did a great job. I highly recommend him for your future BMW service needs!</text>

Very friendly and welcoming service from all staff. My sales rep Jesse Alvernaz got me squared away with a good deal on the car I wanted. Huge lot with tons of inventory so I had many options to test drive and choose from, and they were even willing to get cars brought over from nearby locations if need be. All around a pleasant experience.</Text>

I bought my car at a different dealership but every time I need maintenance I go to the Vista dealership. Ramon always remembers me, he plugs my key in and gets going on the service my car needs. I'm typically in and out in an hour, they always let me know if it's going to be longer. It's always a great experience and they make things easy. I also like their online appointment reminders, it's easy to change the date and time if needed. I highly recommend having your vehicle serviced here if given the chance.< /review>

Own a 2017 i3, have only had it serviced at BMW of Vista. It only needs regular service every two years! Latest was yesterday. Easy to get appointment on day and time of my choice, check in was fast, car was ready within time frame provided. Price was fair. I just wish BMW of Vista could get the parking lane that leads to service marked well, I always get confused.< /text>

< Review>
If it were not for the excellent service from Kassandra my Service Advisor, this would be a 1-star review. When I arrived, I parked and walked in past other service advisors and no greeting. No clear signage was present on where to form a line, so once the waiting customers backed up in the service area it seemed like no one cared about order of arrival, just whoever could run up to them the fastest. My wait time for scheduled maintenance was decent, but I decided to spend some of the time looking at the SUVs outside since we're considering trading in my car for something larger. I walked that lot a while, circling the X5s that they were offering specials on. Salesmen walked past me and not one asked if I needed help or wanted more information. However,  a man and his son who were also there for servicing walked out on the lot after me and a salesman RAN outside to catch up to them and ask them what they needed help with. Being six months pregnant and exhausted, I made my way back in the building and was greeted by another salesman who barely wanted to make eye contact and reluctantly asked me if I needed help. At that point, BMW of Vista had let me know that my payment for servicing was all that was welcome there. Even my courtesy wash was half-done, despite the influx of Auto Nation customers who came in for one at the same time as my appointment. I too, am an Auto Nation customer and purchased my BMW in Torrance, but I see the excellent experience I had when purchasing my vehicle from Auto Nation stopped there. I would have loved to let the manager know about my experience when I was there, but they were busy being serenaded by a guitarist (it must pay the cost to be the boss I guess), but to customers that kind of frivolity can only help explain why the sales team and majority of the service staff are lackluster and rude. Again, kudos to Kassandra for her kindness and excellent service, but I would be happy to drive the extra miles to get my car serviced at any other BMW dealership in any direction than to return to BMW of Vista, and I will never purchase a car here either.<//Review>

<Review>I have purchased BMWs from two other states and always had excellent service but this BMW dealership has provided poor service that does not reflect the BMW experience one would expect. We have had to return numerous times for repairs left unfinished and the overall communication has been very poor. There were even two incidences where our calls were not returned. On a positive note, our salesperson was very professional and did know a lot about the vehicles. The reviews on Yelp are more in line with my experience here.</Review>< pics>

They still use fax machines to order parts like the 1970’s so it takes 2 weeks to get anything because the parts warehouse never checks the fax machine. You have call over to bug them to call the warehouse. They say the fax went through because they have a confirmation. Then the warehouse finally ships the part after a manual call. Bottom line, they can sell you a very modern car for $100,000 but prefer to use clay tablets behind the scenes. It’s totally ridiculous.</review>

The only reason for this rating is due to the fact that I've received two emails saying I have an appointment and when I got there they had no record of it.  Brei was great and had thr X4 looked over, everything checked out okay.  It's just frustrating to have a record for an appointment and showing up and then being told there is no record of the appointment.< /review>

Ramon my service manager was Very friendly, personalized, accommodating, organized, on time, very fair.
Vince my mechanic personally cares and does amazing work. My BMW’s always feels like new after Vince has worked on them, the peace of mind i get from Vince is worth everything.
The team Definitely makes me feel special.
Best Dealer treatment I’ve ever had, and the facilities are beautiful.
Highest recommendation go to BMW of Vista

Highly recommend this dealership. Jesse and the team went above and beyond. Jesse had excellent follow-up and was thorough and  knowledgeable when explaining all of the new features of the car. I also appreciated the transparency of the entire financing team - I certainly felt that they were working with me to get a comfortable monthly payment and to meet my expectations. Jesse was also extremely respectful of my decision to not move forward with a purchase this time around. Overall, a true professional. For an optimal and painless car purchase, look no further.</Review>

<Review>I typically don't like car dealerships or car salesmen because I always leave feeling taken advantage off.  My experience here was refreshingly different.  Jesse has the patience of a saint, I believed he had my best interest at heart and got me into the perfect car for me.  Service beyond sale too simply admirable.  If you go to BMW of Vista, ask for Jesse James!</Review>< pictures>

I was very impressed by the quality of service provided by Kassandra, my service consultant.

Services department is absolutely awesome, so they deserve 5 stars! The sales department is a whole different story and made me feel like a complete inconvenience of their time, all while not one other customer was in the building. I’ll definitely be sure to only have my BMW serviced here and will find another location for the Sales side of things.<//text>

<Review>I recently moved back to San Diego fro out of state and visited BMW Vista for the first time to get new brakes. I was assisted by Kassandra and she was great. She is very friendly  and professional. Her and the rest of the team at BMW Vista went above and beyond with their service and provided great customer service. We will be taking both our BMWs to Kassandra at BLW Vista from now on.

I highly recommend this dealership.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1617349980394, 'text': "Matthew, thank you for your kind review; we are happy to pass along your comments to the team here at BMW of Vista!

<Review>My husband and I had a phenomenal experience at BMW of Vista. Since our previous BMW lease was coming to an end, we wanted to scope out the market and see what was out there. Jesse Alvernaz welcomed us with a big smile under his mask and was very patient while we test drove cars, looked at all available options, and found the right car for us. Together with Anthony Razzouki, the sales manager, Jesse gave us a deal we couldn’t refuse. It blew every other BMW car dealer out of the water. Needless to say, we traded in our car 6 months early and walked away with a bigger and much better vehicle that is constantly getting compliments and stares. The ride is smooth, safe, and we are thrilled with our electric hybrid purchase (right in time for rising gas prices). Our happiness is due to Jesse’s diligence in making sure we walked away happy and fulfilled. He even followed up the next day with me to make sure things were still going well — that gesture alone is different from my previous BMW experience. Thank you Jesse, Anthony, and Morgan in finance for being so patient, flexible, and for doing everything with a huge smile on your face. We will be back!!< /Review>< pictures>

I worked with Jesse to find my dream car because his enthusiasm and energy was infectious...I wanted the excitement and experience of buying the car of my dreams to be top notch and he delivered. What I love most about working with Jesse is, I know he will go above and beyond to make sure I am happy and taken care of - pre and post purchase. He worked really hard for my deal and I appreciate all the effort, time, and texts that went into it. I recommend you do your homework and then check out this dealership and find him. The finance manager was also amazing, along with the other sales guys, Mo and Craig. The facility is also very clean, organized, professional and they offer free water and Star Bucks hot chocolate, can’t beat it!< /Review>

Great customer service with friendly, knowledgeable representatives. The buying process was much easier than most dealers and they followed up with me to make sure I was happy. No other dealer has ever done that with me. And of course, I love my X3!< /Text>

The I3 nestled in 3KW of solar panels.

BMW Vista
Craig Mayville
Ryan Bowlan

My name is Gary Brown, and it is two weeks after the purchase of the 2017 I3 Rex, vin V891803.  I will present this review in 2 parts, the dealership and the car.

The Dealership:

I had already identified 2 examples of 3-year-old models with the Rex option in San Diego.  I set morning and afternoon appointments intending to buy one or the other.  BMW of Vista was the first and only visit that day.   The entire experience was just as I expected.  After all, any trip to a BMW dealer is kinda like mecca especially when you are buying your third bimmer.  I bought the brand many years ago so all that was left was the details.

The staff was easygoing, knowledgeable and this made the experience fun.  There were kinks and it ended up taking all day, but this is the beginning of a long relationship, so the investment was worth it.  There were only two missteps that deserve discussion.

I made the appointment to see an electric car and you showed me a depleted battery.  It gave me the opportunity to see the Rex in action but that is not what this car is about.  Besides, it is never good to leave any batteries completely discharged.

The second misstep is much more subtle and is as much my fault as yours.  This was the first time I have ever touched an electric car.  Sure, I did a bunch of research and became knowledgeable but reading about it is quite different than driving it.  I had a 150-mile journey over a pretty big mountain with few gas stations in the middle of the trip to get home and left the shop with half a battery and a 2-gal gas tank.

I needed to do planning that my E46 wagon or any car for that matter, never required.  In a perfect world, you should have talked with me about the ride home and I should have listened.  The great engineering BMW did save the day.  I was sad that I pulled into Pine Valley at the top of the mountain with 17 miles of range left but happy when I got to the bottom of the mountain and found 17 miles of additional electric range.

The Car:

This is the tightest vehicle I have ever driven.  Everything from the body and drive train to the buttons and knobs are tight.  Yesterday I moved the 325xi for the picture above and it is the first time in 6 years that the wagon felt old.  The engineering of the I3 is impeccable.

I live in the desert with no utilities and the single biggest factor is my ability to charge with sunlight.  I had to buy an industrial inverter but at the end of the day, the I3 fits right in.  The ability to change the charge level is a welcome feature allowing me to run the house normally with the car charging.  I traveled 35 miles to use the nearest public charger and the I3 performed flawlessly.  Now that I am home, charging is no longer an issue.

I have noticed that the indicated range of both the battery and rex are changing all the time and while this behavior is totally expected, it is disconcerting at first.   This morning I did the 8-mile post office trip, left with 119 miles electric range and got home with 133 miles indicated.  I have pondered how I would design the system differently but quickly concluded that the engineers did it right and I am already used to it after only a week.

In Conclusion:

I am in the autumn of my life and I wanted a taste of the future now.  This is the future.  I have reduced my carbon footprint to almost zero and have not only given up nothing but greatly improved the quality of my daily life.  The dealership experience was top notch and BMW really outdid themselves with this vehicle.  I look forward to a long and pleasant relationship with my I3.

I would do this whole thing again in a heartbeat.  Thank you all.</text>

My family and I are so grateful for BMW of Vista and the customer support that Kassandra provided. Our 2015 BMW X5d had a timing chain issue and was out of warranty. BMW of Vista was able to help with the very large repair bill and we cannot thank them enough. They did not have to do this. We just moved to the area and BMW of Vista will be our new go-to spot for all our BMW needs.< /Text>

< Review>
Sold my hellcat here. They gave me the exact offer I received via autonation and didn’t try and hassle like Kbb or dodge dealers saying it needed xyz to extend profits.

Hailey made it a seamless process and was very professional from start to finish. Had a check within a few hours.

If I ever venture to the bmw brand will definitely look to buy here.< /Review>

< Review>
BMW Vista (part of AutoNation) has been great since I switched over there in 2020. They have the best customer service of anyone around. Very reasonable pricing... and I trust their opinion on my aging 2010 535GT. Highly recommend Ramon Ventura as service advisor. Knowledgeable about the BMW product and outstanding communication. Can’t say enough good things about this dealership.< /Review>

<review>Never buy a car from here or even try. Recently tried to set up my first car purchase/finance and ever since they picked up the phone it sounded kinda weird. They knew that someone was buying the car I wanted but still insisted on me driving 2 hours before I even got approved for the finance so that they could up sell me the car. I’m not sure what they were trying to pull here but they made me wait over 3 hours to get approved just to have them call me back and tell me that the car has been sold. Was actually going to buy a car from here but not anymore, and I suggest anyone reading this doesn't either.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1617973674468, 'text': "Hello Colton, we regret to hear that you had a negative experience with us, but would appreciate the chance to turn your experience around.

Poor communication of my vehicles status even after I let them know I was going out of town the next day. Then when I went to pickup my car the advisor, Brian, tried to rip me off by charging a different amount than what I was quoted at the time I authorized the service, then he acted put out and condescending when I insisted they honor the quoted price. Not what I expect from a luxury brand like BMW. All in all this place has slid badly downhill since they went acquired by Autonation.<//Review>

After cancelling my contract per their return policy, I am still trying to get a refund of my down payment 2 weeks later.  Getting the run around from their finance department.  Here is my story:  Worst car buying experience EVER!!!  I will not be buying a car from these folks ever again.  I guess it was my mistake because the car was very dirty and they rushed me through signing of all documents before they showed me the car after they cleaned it.  That is when I noticed multiple paint and rim issues and the Salesman told me that the defects were priced into the car price (yep, you read that right, the defects were priced into the car!!!).  Well, I don't care how cheap the car is, I would have never bought the car with all the defects.  Then many of the items that come standard with the car were missing, including the Cargo cover (which was in the car originally when I made the deal and then they removed it! and then lied about removing it saying that it was on another car they showed me.  Well, they never showed me another car.  They were straight out LYING!!), Missing First Aid Kit,  Missing front console socket cover (a $20 item), Missing Mobility System, Missing Onboard Vehicle Tool Kit (which includes the tow ring!) and get this, No valve caps on the tires, YES VALVE CAPS.  After complaining about these items, they would only provide the cargo cover, part of the grill which had a chip (Believe it or not, they asked if they could just ship the grill part to us and we could install it!) and then touch up the paint in one area, and that was only because we were going to cancel the deal.  Yes, you read that correct, on a $31.5K CERTIFIED car, they refused to put $1 worth of plastic valve caps on the tires!!  They replaced one of the gouged rims with a different marred up rim!   Yes, replaced a bad rim with another bad rim!!  The y took a paint pen to the scratches and you could see the pn marks on the car when they were done...they said it would blend...RIIIIIIIIIIGHT!!  NOT!!
And they refused to provide the tool kit with the tow hook.  I can't believe they are allowed to sell a certified car without the original items that came with the car.  So, moral of the story it to make them wash the car first so you cab see all defects and ask up front about all of the equipment that should come with the car, because once you sign those papers, you go through fire trying to get them to change anything, including providing small cheap items like $1 valve caps.  Thank God that it was an AutoNation BMW and they had a 5 day return policy.  We took the car back and bought another beautiful car from Ontario BMW that same day.  Of course they tried to "make it right" once they saw I was returning the car, but after dealing with the Mr. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO Salesman, it left a very bad taste in my mouth and nothing they could do would resolve it.   They need to fire this guy as his NO, NO, NO, NO, NO attitude cost them the sale. Returning the car took over 1 1/2 hours as the finance guy was at lunch!  When I told them I had a doctor's appointment, they flat out said, well it takes a while and you can always take the car!  NOT ON YOUR LIFE, I WON'T.  And watch out when buying the extended warranty as it is a third party warranty, NOT a BMW warranty.  Only found that out when I bought my other car and the other BMW looked at the paperwork.  WATCH OUT FOR THESE FOLKS AS THEY WILL TRY TO TAKE YOU AT EVERY TURN!!<//Review>

Tom Mignosi and Mo Kamal took EXCELLENT care of my wife and I the second we walked into the dealership. They were both transparent and in our best interest, which is hard to find at any car dealership. Very pleased with their service and customer care. I will never forget the experience and candidness. Also, I will never go to any other dealership again. BMW of Vista has my lifelong business.<//text>

Worst experience I've ever had. The sales person, Akex, was rude, unprofessional, discriminating and prejudice. My wife and I went in there to try to test drive an X7 but Alex was only focused on making sure we knew how much the monthly payment would be, he even calculated the montly payment right there and told us it would be around $1300, btw he didn't even know how much of a down payment I was planning on putting in! He kept asking questions about our financials even after I told him we first wanted to test drive the vehicle and then we could talk about the numbers. He insisted saying he "wanted to make sure we could afford the vehicle"!!! At that moment i just said to him it wasn't about how much we could afford but instead how much we'd like to spend and that was why I was being very specific about the car that we wanted to test drive. After a few more questions about our financial situation he finally agreed to get the key so we could drive the vehicle. At that moment wife and I were thinking maybe best to leave, it was more than clear that Alex didn't think we could afford the vehicle and he was really "trying very hard to make us aware of that". He had an attitude and the whole conversation was very discriminating. But we were there already and since my wife drives a bmw 535i I really wanted her to test drive the x7 cause with 2 kids now we need an SUV. Big mistake, we should have left the dealer right there... Alex came back with the key and right before we got in the X7 he said that it had no gas in it and that we could only drive it in the parking lot!! I responded "can you put some gas in it?" He said "no"... I couldn't take it no more. I had never before felt so humiliated and discriminated. We went in the office and talked to the manager and made him aware of the whole situation. They really need to re-train their sales staff. As for us, we will be buying Mercedes CLS450 instead. The X7 that we are talking about is $85k msrp, the Mercedes that we will be buying is $91k msrp... Alex needs to learn manners and not to pre judge.<//Text>

DO NOT BUY. BEWARE. Absolutely horrible experience with Vista BMW. After being in contact with them about the car I was interested in for over a week, I decided to make the 7 hour drive to Vista BMW to go purchase the car. I was told as I started my drive that they had sent my credit application in and they set me up for an appointment to come purchase the vehicle. Contact with the dealer after this was met with unanswered phones, dead lines, and what seemed to be stalling tactics. This is where the shady practices come into play. As I’m nearing my fifth hour in driving I called to make sure everything is going smoothly as they said it would, and they said they were busy and to call back at 7pm. I called back at 7pm as Im 30 MINUTES AWAY from BMW and MICHAEL WILLE answered the phone very rudely saying that they had never sent my finance application in to the bank and that they had sold the car “30 seconds ago” and taunted me by laughing and saying “well the cars still here on the lot but its with its new owners”.  I have NEVER dealt with such incompetence in customer service and I hope whoever is reading this will take my advice and STEER CLEAR of the atrocious practices at BMW Vista.<//Text>

New to the area I was concerned when the engine light came on my x3. I showed up at the BMW Vista location basically concerned about if the car was safe to drive, Cassandra was extremely helpful immediately getting me a rental and assuring me that I would be taken care of first thing next business day.
They did a full diagnostic on the car offered me options for safety in the future and took care of the problem thank you Vista BMW I’m in good hands with you</Review>

<Text>I wish the dealer had been much clearer beforehand about the total price, and afterwards I wish they had provided much better information about the work that was done for the unexpectedly-high cost. Like many BMW owners, I am enthusiastic about my car. Telling me that something was wrong and that you fixed it isn't helpful; I want details about the problem and the fix. Only then will I better appreciate the level of effort and cost.

I'm now in a position where I feel like I was taken. It may or may not be true, and the dealer's poor communication directly affects that perspective. Too bad this seems to be typical of the interactions so many have with dealerships.< /Text>< date>

<Text>We had a great car buying experience. We purchased an X3, and we couldn’t be happier.  We love the car, but we also loved the people ar Vista.  They made the buying process easy and enjoyable.  It was really a pleasure to do business with them.  I am sure when we are ready again for a new car, they will be the first place we look.</Text><user_name>Gregory Allen< /user_name><gmapID>0x80dc7156759f6119:0xf0a899958d30efa9< /gmapID><Date>1603932423616<//Date></record>

<Text>The staff here at the BMW dealership are great. Friendly, polite and it didn't feel over the top when trying to purchase a car. After my purchase, I noticed a few issues and the staff (Matthew Bell, Craig Mayville) acted quickly and made sure to help me resolve the problems I had. Really good customer service! I find car sales a bit daunting but they made it a great experience!!<//Text>< pics>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>Understaffed and mismanaged. It took them over 20 minutes to realize they sent the part I ordered (and already paid for) to another store. I spent extra buying from a local dealership instead of buying from Amazon thinking I’d get at least better service. Boy was I wrong. When I asked about correcting the issue and getting my part (a Christmas present) their only solution was that I needed to come back on their time line. Needless to say I won’t be bringing my business there again.

UPDATE: After having the parts manager contact me, they’ve apologized and offered to correct the issue. I appreciate the attempt to maintain customer satisfaction. I’ve decided to maintain a 3 star rating as I don’t believe it should have come to this, and had I not written the negative review, I doubt anyone would have been aware of the issue. That being said, I will attempt to give them my business again as in the end, aside from some frustration, no harm no foul.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1609187035429, 'text': 'Thanks for the feedback, Zach.

<Review>Recently bought a 2021 540i, Corey and Anthony were both awesome! Great customer service from both. They helped me get the car I WANTED instead of trying to talk me into getting a different car like other dealerships (not a big deal for most but for me it was much appreciated to know they listened to what I wanted) Steve was also great. My whole experience with BMW Vista has been nothing but amazing so far! Thank you guys!<//Review>< pictures>

BMW Vista did a great job. Worked to get me the most affordable repair to my vehicle which is out of warranty. Braie was friendly and kept me up to date, I also had a loaner so I could carry on with my work the next 2 days. Chris in repair did a great job as well, ensuring I was covered and up to date, great communications. Vista came thru this last visit with 5 stars.</Review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Terrible experience as a Google Guide I will be sharing it across my network.

1. Sales person put notes in the system that made the other staff laugh at me when i called. Offensive.

2. This dealership tried to so many additional fees they could not explain to my purchase, it raised the cost by 20%. This included a $300 "Presitige Fee", a "$90 Documentation Fee", tried to charge me $2000 for shipping when the quote was for $761, additional Titling fee of $990, and an "electronic filing fee" of $29 just to name the few I am willing to spend the time writing down.

3. The staff doesn't seem interested in selling cars. Really answer the phone like order takers sitting around at the dealership. Even when asking for a quote they had to be reminded to do so.

4. Never was able to get a manager on the phone after my requests.

5. Will be raising concerns with AutoNation corporate.

6. I would personally steer clear of this dealership if you need any level of engagement or for them to really do anything at all. Maybe they are still all working from home.

****Update***

Tried calling the general manager as told in the response below, I was transferred to the wrong person who told me he wasn’t there now, or very often and the review responses are just done by a company they pay. 😂< /Text>< pics>

Braie Young was my Service Advisor. He provided recommendations with zero pressure and gave me all of my options. Because of his extremely good customer service, I opted for all he recommended. He went the extra mile when I picked up my car to make sure I would not wait long. Also, while I was waiting, Kassandra Kinsey, another Service Advisor, and I had a casual conversation. She was such a nice person. My experience so good, that I posted about it on my FB page. Times are hard, people are very stressed. Braie made me feel valued. Customer service won today. I saw kindness and good intentions today. The human contact experience....can be so amazing, even when you are just planning on getting an oil change.<//text>

A big thank you to Tim the service manager for making sure to get my vehicle fixed. I told him my issue and he told me to bring it in and have his techs fix it. He connected me with Ramon and he was really professional and made sure to keep me up to date with the progress of my vehicle. I also want to acknowledge one specific employee named Nickolas. This young man went above and beyond to assist me in locating my wallet that I had forgotten in the loaner vehicle. I came back after leaving the dealership after closing hours and on my way back, Nickolas was getting in his vehicle to go home, and I told him about me forgetting my wallet in the loaner and he said he will go get it. I told him I’ll just go and have someone else grab it for me. Unfortunately no one was there and all of a sudden here comes Nickolas with my wallet. What a huge surprise. He has a great attitude, friendly service and I really appreciate everything from Vista BMW. Thank you guys!</review>

<rate>2< /rate><Text>I generally like this place but was very disappointed in their lack of help.  I have owned many BMW vehicles over the years.  I ran into a strange issue with my 3 series where I was unable to open my trunk.  This was most likely due to the new battery being installed (or programmed) incorrectly.  As the battery is located in the trunk this sparked a myriad of issues.  I took the vehicle to Carlsbad Exclusive, All German Auto,  Lael's and BMW of North County /Vista.  I even had a master locksmith work on it.  None of them were able to solve the issue.  North County BMW kept the vehicle for over a week, charged me for diagnostics (as others did) and could not solve the issue.   To add insult to injury, Tim Lewis the Service manager at North County BMW, while nice to my face, would not return my calls and frankly hid from me.  I took the vehicle to Chris at European Autoworks who accepted the challenge and did what others could not.  The trunk and the car now work fine thanks to European Autoworks not this BMW dealership.  Crazy.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>I will start by saying the only reason I am giving this place more than 1 star, is because of the two fantastic ladies that worked there, one of them found me a private, clean bathroom to nurse my daughter in.

Other than that, my experience here is 1 star. My family is moving overseas, so we need to sell all the household vehicles (all were bought from BMW). We decided to drive an hour to Vista BMW because we received great customer service over the phone- all the details and the necessary items we needed to bring had been discussed prior to coming in. When we got there it was a different story! When we arrived, the power had gone out. No big deal, no one can help that. Once we were able to have our cars appraised, we received offers we thought were acceptable. However, we ran into a title issue with one car, where they would not accept our legal document, even though this was discussed previously over the phone. The answer we were given was "there are too many questions about the document." So we move on to the next car, and accepted the offer. We wait, and wait. THREE HOURS LATER we are told that the "system was down" and was "no longer showing the original offer" Mind you we are with an 8 month old baby! We let them know we would continue to wait since we already invested this much time. Another hour passes and they basically tell us to leave because it wouldn't be fixed by today. It was blamed on the power outage, which doesn't even make sense, considering we were quoted AFTER the power outage. Here we are, 4 days later still waiting on a call. I am sure after wasting all of our time we sure won't even get a courtesy call. They never wanted to do business with us in the first place, either because we weren't buying something new or because part of my family is from a different country. I am not sure which one, but I would never do business with them in the future!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1607723384578, 'text': "Lauren, thank you for leaving this detailed feedback about your experience with our dealership.

My wife's car is a 2018 X-1.
On 6/25/2020 she took the car into BMW of Vista (CA), at this time the car had 16,141 miles. She took it in for an oil change. When we picked it up, the report said the car needed an alignment.
On 11/28/2020 she took the car in because the brake light was on. I thought this odd since the car only had 17,391 miles. The service writer told my wife the car was due for service so they changed the oil. When my wife came home with the new report, I looked it over. When I saw the oil was changed, I looked at the last service. They changed the oil after only1200 miles! This was totally unnecessary! Then I noticed that there was no mention of an alignment needed on the Multi Point Inspection! We have not had the alignment done yet. So how does a car need an alignment 5 months ago, but not now?
I have two questions, was the dealership ripping off BMW for the oil change? Was the dealership trying to rip me off for an alignment?</Text>

We went to browse the lot for a new car as our lease was up in January. We were approached by Anthony Razzouki. As soon as he heard we were interested in an M model he put us in touch with their M specialist Jesse James Alvernaz. He certainly knows his M models! He has an infectious enthusiasm for the car and his job..... He and Anthony worked out an outstanding deal for us. We couldn’t be happier!! We look forward to working with them again.</Text>

Great service here. Had to come in for an airbag recall, and they offered a complimentary car wash but I told them my car is too low for drive-through washes. They accommodated and offered to do a hand wash instead. Would recommend.</text>

Nice, quiet, small service center. They get the job done, have friendly staff and it's clean. I liked that they weren't trying to be over pushy with upsales, finding things that weren't wrong, wrong etc. Braie was quick, polite and offered other to assist when I needed services in the future... I'll definitely return because of the service today!!!👍🏽< /Review>

I drove my car to the dealer as previously schedule thru phone call.  I arrived 15 minutes ahead of time at 10:30.  Waited for the service personnel to see me.  I could understand that he was busy.  I did not mind waiting.  He told me it has to be 2 hours waiting and he suggest to drive me home.  BMW will drop the car off later at my house.  It was about 18 min drive.  When I got home and it is almost 12:30.  When it was close to 4PM I called asking about my car.  The gentleman told me it has to stay there over night.  I had scheduled to deliver food to my friend that afternoon.  Next morning I had exercise class at the park at 9, so I asked them to deliver it by 8:30.  By 8 o'clock I called and he told me he will get back to me soon.  Not until about 10 o'clock he called me and he said they will send a car and I pick up my car at the dealership.  The car  needed change 2 tires and they found a leak on the air system, and check the SOS emergency system.  I am sure the mechanical and electronic work were done right because I trust BMW workmanship.  However, the scheduling and logistic really need improvement.</text>

Great experience with BMW of Vista and service representative Brian Chartier. I was going to a different BMW dealer but I decided to change after I was unable to get a representative to call back. Brian was very helpful on the phone and even more helpful in person. What a pleasant place, with lots of space and friendly people. The service was extraordinary with all the details spelled out clearly. I like the personal attention in these crazy times.</Text>

Brae has been my Service Advisor since I bought my car. He always goes above and beyond to take care of my car and is very accommodating.  He is, hands down, the best person at any dealership my family has worked with. The Vista location is not the closest BMW to my house, but I take my car there because of Brae.  He is honest, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  If you ever have to take your car in for service, ask for him!< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>If you want a headache and to have the worst experience ever, come here!

We bought two cars from here, within a coupe of months. Sadly, the first car was rear ended and totaled.

Morgan Gerken was so sweet to our face. However, when we needed our easy care pamphlet sent to us or even texted to us, it was never done. She even wrote my name incorrectly on the paperwork we signed. She once responded to a text thinking I was someone else, but when I told her who I was, she was like oh yeah, I will send it to you, but I am still waiting since September 2020. Then when the car was totaled, we were told we can get a refund for the service and maintenance car packages we bought. We told her we wanted it and I sent her all the information she requested by email. Then after a week or so, when we came back to buy the second car, she was like do you want me to still file it? Are you serious? We were told the wait would be 4-6 weeks.

The second time we went back, we did not even get an acknowledgement from Corey Hayward. He was the one that initially helped us buy the first car and seemed so ‘cool.’ Well he could not be bothered with us this time around. Maybe we are not good enough for him? Not spending enough money? The one text and email message regarding promised items was just ignored. I even got him on the phone once and his tone was so rude and annoyed. Almost like how dare you call me!

Next we got Salvatore Buzzetta. He seemed nice, too. I thought it was very kind of them to offer to send us a manual and wheel locks. A month went by and I heard nothing/received nothing in the mail. So, that is when the 24 emails back and forth happened. Not once did Salvatore say I am sorry it is taking so long. I had to follow up every single time and basically beg for these items that were promised to us. They were going to fix a couple of things on the car, too. We were told someone will reach out to us in a week or two. Nothing! My son had to call and make the appointment!

Then we have Anthony Razzouki. Again, nice to our faces. We waited for our refunds from mid-Sept to late-Dec/early-Jan. I called Steve Marshalek once about it and I apparently bothered him, by asking about the refund. So, I did not ‘bother’ him again.

I emailed Anthony and told him there is a huge issue with my refund. He said he would call me in the morning. The next day comes around, and I do not hear from him. So, I call BMW of Vista. I get the run around. I emailed Anthony and told him I need to speak to his manager immediately or I will call corporate. In between this time, I decided to call BMW of Vista one more time and I got Mathew Van Lierop.

Mathew did listen. Tell me why and how all of a sudden this check we have been waiting for now all of a sudden is being printed the next day? All the issues I mentioned, Mathew had a reason or explanation for each one BUT NEVER said I am sorry! There is not one decent human being in this location. If management can not say sorry, then why would any of the workers? They learn from their managers.

There is an aura here of I am so high and mighty, I work at BMW and my ego is the size of Planet Earth. Not even say I am sorry that you have had to deal with this. I only got well this takes this long and we should have communicated it with you. Obviously! I even told him I would really appreciate someone owning up to a mistake and being humble. Never, not once, did I hear I am sorry.

Then we find out that the oil changes can only be done at an Autonation location. Morgan told us we can take it anywhere. So she lied. Also, we never were told about a deductible with the third party warranty service. My son had to find out the hard way. When I asked Mathew about this, he just says yes you have a deductible. I said so Morgan lied to us about the oil changes and warranty? He does not say anything. Mathew is completely unapologetic.

This is why it is better to just go to corporate right away. Being kind gets you nowhere. They treated me like a doormat!

Finally, I did the right thing and called corporate!</Review><response>{'time': 1611439355925, 'text': 'Hi Linda, we appreciate you taking the time to respond.

Just completed a lease of my new 330i with Alex Trifacante.  He was fantastic to work with.   We did all my negotiations over the phone in a couple calls.  Alex is extremely easy-going, good natured and honest.  No games or pressure.  Just fast, great service.  Same goes for his manager, Anthony.  They gave me a great deal - other dealers weren’t coming close - and both answered all my questions quickly and thoroughly.

Vista had the only silver 330 in Southern California, so even though they were 100 miles away, I leased thru them.  Alex drove my new car to my house in LA and was completely safe and respectful of my covid concerns.

<text>Recently had my BMW serviced at BMW Vista  and the service was better than expected.  Service consultant Ramon was very helpful and knowledgeable on getting you taken care of with your vehicle needs as well as keeping you informed and up-to-date with your vehicle.  Me personally I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to get their car serviced or even buy from them. They will take care of you and the staff there seem pretty friendly and helpful.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>I just moved from NJ and I was looking for a new dealership in California and I have to say BMW of Vista has amazing customer service. Jesse Alvernaz and Anthony Razzouki have gone above and beyond to get me my dream car. They made the whole process enjoyable and I would most definitely recommend their services. I am very pleased with the whole experience and feel super happy and confident in my purchase.< /Review>< UserId.>

Started out 5 stars, but ended 1 star ...
Enjoyable until it came to talking numbers ...
We were looking for something very specific and decided to evaluate the options at BMW Vista. We went in a later on a Friday evening; it was not busy, which was great. We started with a salesmen (Mo) who was accommodating and attentive at the time. We told him what we were in the market for - a used BMW M3 and an unknown business car for my wife. We drove the 2 different used M3s knowing they did not meet the exact colors and specs we wanted, but needed to do our due diligence. The salesmen was helpful even though we declined on those cars. We moved on to looking for a business/luxury vehicle. We drove a used m550i and X5, but they were not a good fit for my wife. We made an appointment with Mo for Sunday 10:30 to check out a brand new X5 and X6 that both had to be pulled from remote dealer car lots.

We arrived at the dealer on Sunday. We sat down and found out the cars requested were not moved for some paperwork issue that we were not told about (that raises an eyebrow). The salesmen then redirects us to look at brand new 5 series. We play along for a bit and drive the new car. Talking with the salesmen, being polite to say we rather look at the other vehicles we set an appointment for. We go on a ride from Vista to Encinitas to “hunt down the cars.”  Time is ticking well passed lunch time. We tell the salesmen directly that we see through his sales tactics, and they are not going to work. We turn down the X5 and arrive at the X6 ... almost 3 hours after the scheduled appointment time. We tell the salesmen we appreciate his time and that this is the X6 is the closest thing on trim level to what we were looking for. Was very specific and did not say “this is the car” or “let’s buy it.”

We test drive back to Vista and immediately the salesmen wants to talk sale. We tell him again that we are doing our due diligence/research and would not be buying today. We said we would look at their finance and numbers. We say flat out that my wife doesn’t fit in the X6 (steering wheel does not move far enough) and the X6 is not red ... and it is not a car (it’s an SUV). He then starts with the comment of his time being valuable and he has spent a lot of time with us. Understood, we said we appreciated his time more than once and know he’s been hustling. However, if the salesmen valued our time then he would have called before the appointment to tell us the vehicles were not there. Instead he wanted to get us in the door to bide time. Also, if time were valuable, we would not have gone on a 3 hour hunt for cars when we specifically made an appointment. We do not enjoy our time being wasted either.

It then gets a bit more tense and salesmen asks “what he can do to make a sale today.” The answer to him was “nothing.” We stated flat out again that the sales tactics were not going to work. He got a bit defensive and said “nothing is not going to feed my wife and kids.” At that very moment we saw the salesmen’s true motivations ... it was not the customer’s best interests. That comment, dripping with guilt and emotional manipulation by tugging at heart strings, is not what people come to a BMW dealer for. We know times are tough right now, but that is no excuse for pushy sales tactics and unprofessional comments when a salesmen is told “no.” We are the customers and at the end of the day it is our money to spend, not the salesmen’s money; something every salesmen should remember.</Text>

<Text>My lease was to end in a few weeks.  I called to make an appointment to discuss the options for the lease end.  I met with Sal who guided me through what I could consider.  Having been a customer of BMW of Vista for a number of years, Sal, Corey, and Steve treated me very warmly.  After looking at my options and having the opportunity to test drive the class of BMW I was interested in, I gave Sal the details of what I was interested in.   He asked what I would like to see my lease payment to be and discussed it with sales manager.  He returned with a comparison of what the payment would typically be based on my down payment and what they were willing to do based on my loyalty to the dealership.  The lease agreement they proposed was perfect.  Sal had to pick the car up at a location off site.  When he returned it was discovered the car I had agreed on had been committed to another dealership.  The good news turned out to be that the car they would give me had several additional features, including upgraded paint among several other items.  The lease payment would remain the same.  When I met with Steve in the finance office the process was very efficient and cordial.  I was offered certain warranty additions which I declined.  In some cases that can be a moment when it becomes a bit of a "hard sell" to convince one that they should purchase some level of warranty upgrade.  Steve did none of that.  He simply presented the choices and accepted my decision without further "selling."  Sal did a great job of all the little details related to BMW Assist and setting up a handful of the technology matters that are engineered into a BMW.  I have had to take care of a few details related to my insurance, needing to send them documents regarding the lease, etc.  Sal and Steve's responses have been prompt.  I highly recommend the team at BMW of Vista.  They approach their business in a professional manner.  There is never a feeling of being "sold."  It is a conversation about the various options and a feeling that they want to accommodate your interests.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Took my used 328i for a new radiator due to having a leak and it was covered under their SULEV warranty so luckily I didn’t have to spend anything on the repair but when they returned the car I found out they had overfilled the coolant so that wasn’t good, my car now makes a noise that I hadn’t heard before, I had also asked if they could take a look to see if anything else that was under warranty needed repairs and I’m sure that wasn’t done.<//review>

Went in for service, my service guy Brian is great, however at this point the rest of the staff makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by helping you. Feels like people are just doing their time there with no real attention to customer service.

My service went fine, but my car was not close to being ready when they told me it was after I called for an update. Waited around for an hour or so at the dealership waiting for my car. I don't mind service not being fast, but if you tell me it'll be ready at 2:00 and it's not ready until 3:00 that's annoying.

Checking in was no better. Had a 7:!5 appt didn't talk to anyone until after 7:30 and didn't get out of there until after 8:00. Been getting my cars serviced there for years but might be time for a change.<//Text>

<review>Took car in for an annoying rattle in the dash and a complete detail.  Totally satisfied when I returned to pick up my auto.  BUT...now the annoying rattle is back, within a week.  Now I will see how good the service really is once I attempt to get it corrected on the "return" to the service department.</review>< Pictures>

I had the chance to walk around the show room and check out the new horses in the corral.....Vehicle inspection included.  Did I mention a car wash and an interior clean up and sanitize?

Went there with the impression with of a car being 4,000 dollars less on car gurus and I even confirmed with one of the associates that it was correct before I headed over there. Get there great customer service and clean environment got the drive the car it was great. Get down to crunching the numbers and the priced was increased 4,000 dollars and they said they couldn’t honor it because it’s not on there actual website and they had put in for the change and car gurus never did anything till the day prior of me showing up. So it wasn’t for me at that price. All in all great customer service they weren’t super pushy at all un like most dealerships. Definitely recommend them to others.<//Text>

On my last visit I went in for an oil change and a few other things. The work that they did was awesome!!! I just don't understand why I always get charged different amounts for the same oil change on the same exact car. For example, on my last visit I was charged $155, another time $120 and another time $88. I'm just talking about the line that reads oil change on my statement and NOT the prices for the other things that I had done. It seams that you have to get lucky at the register with the right person charging you to get a better deal. Why not just have the same set price for the same exact  car. It just doesn't make any sense.<//Text>

I’m an Autonation customer and I purchased a vehicle at another Autonation location that had a bad USB port and software issue. I brought it in here to have it serviced under the warranty a week after I bought the car. It’s now two weeks later and I still don’t have the car back. The time it should have taken to fix this simple issue should have been no more than a few days. This is absolutely unacceptable how long it has taken to handle a simple issue. I won’t be back here for anything.</Text>

I couldn’t imagine a better experience buying a car! It was such a relief not having to worry about the haggle of getting a good price, or a pushy salesman and they delivered!! Everyone was extremely kind and thorough keeping me informed through the process. They were happy to answer all my questions, send extra photos and do it all from my home during this strange time. A special thank you to Anthony in Sales, Morgan in finance, and Darrin in management for such a positive and seamless experience and proving there is a better way to buy a car and have it delivered! Can’t thank you enough! Highly recommend!!<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>The Sales Manager & representative, Sal, were very helpful in my purchase of a 2017 BMW Alpina. We had a number of emails during the lock-down period to clarify some of the options included. We were also able to settle on a price of my trade-in that while lower than I expected was on the low end of fair. The day following my signing of the loan agreement with BMW Finance at 1.99%, BMW lowered the financing rate to 0.9%.  While Vista did not call me to tell me of the change, once they were informed of the change, they agreed to rewrite the loan agreement for the 0.9% financing. Since I am in a vulnerable group, they agreed to bring the revised financing papers to me in Pasadena, a 1 1/2 hour drive, which was much appreciated.  All things considered they did an excellent job.</text>< pictures>

The car was immediately checked in for repair and loaner was provided. I would like to Thank Thelma for constant communication and the Technician for properly diagnosing the engine.

Worked w/ Aaron P on purchasing a CPO and he did a great job from start to finish with handling all questions and concerns related to the sale. He also went the extra mile for me on something that I had made a mistake on and was able to work with management to correct so I appreciate his efforts and that of the dealership in coming through for me on first BMW purchase and making it as effortless as possible.</review>

<review>Just brought home my new to me i3! This was probably the lease painful used car buying experience I’ve ever had. I went by myself as my husband had to work and I never felt pressured or bullied. Mike Wille my sales guy was fantastic! He had the car pulled up to the front when I got there and the financing was nailed down. I was only there a total of 2.5 hours that includes the test drive and paperwork. Steve in financing was great and had papers signed quickly. He never made me feel bad or guilty for not accepting the add ons. I got an even better rate than I could’ve imagined with my credit. Covid precautions were in full effect. Everyone social distanced and everyone had masks on. I felt very safe. Thank you BMW of Vista!< /review>< UserId.>

Wow this place is the best car buying experience I have had so far, and would recommend it to anyone who doesn’t want buyers remorse. Ask for Alex Torres, he is a cool salesman that helped me out and really   took his time to make sure I got behind the BMW that I would love. All the staff is really honest and know are the cars in and out.</Text>

Kathy was wonderful.  We called her immediately once our 230I notification came on stating the vehicle was low in oil.  She took us right in and provided us with a loaner car.  Our car was fixed and returned clean within 24 hours.  Thanks Kathy for always being 5 stars and going above and beyond< /Review>

Everything about BMW of Vista is top notch.  Best car buying experience I've ever had.

Just returned from picking up my car from the service department for the replacement of a punctured tire. Once again, received great service. They're simply the best.< /Review>

My salesman was awesome. I called him and told him where I wanted to be on a vehicle after doing a lot of research.  Not only did he deliver I got a vehicle with more upgrades than anticipated. The only problem was it took a long time to get in to sign the paperwork. Probably an hour and a half since they were backed up. But other than that great place will go back again.<//Review>

Had a horrible experience the 1st time felt discriminated whatever the 2nd time that helped by Agentleman named Jesse  My advice is if you have to go in to this dealership ask for Jesse very polite very friendly the the 3 people that we spoke with Jesse was the most professional one I  personally  felt  he was being honest made you feel important   I didn't feel like I was being forced to  Deal something I didn't want A person who was helping with the financing in the other hand was the worse out of all of them.But even after I felt very comfortable with working with Jesse.Thanks Jessy  Appreciate  Your time and for not  Wasting my time 5 stars..</text>

BMW of Vista was extremely accommodating - when our car went into limp mode, they were close by and took us right in. Ramon was outstanding in his handling of our situation! My reason for not giving 5 stars was because of the price of the parts. Yes, I know "it's a BMW", but when I can get OEM parts online at 20% of the cost charged by the dealer, I have to complain a little. I can justify $20-25 for a spark plug, but $100? But again Ramon helped out here and we now have an 8 year old X5 that runs better than it has since we bought it 2 years ago.</text>

This 5 star review is for Brae in the service department. Any time I have to take my car for service I always request Brae. I have been getting my car serviced at the Vista location for the past 5  years. Brae is wonderful to deal with and keeps me returning to BMW with a smile on my face.  He is friendly, professional, courteous, knowledgeable and quick to help. Brae will go out of his way to provide exceptional quality care and has saved me money by finding discounts or suggesting preventative work before it becomes a problem later. The dealership can be a bit pricey but I think it's worth it for the quality of service I get and the peace of mind that my car is safe to drive after I leave there.</review>

<text>Service was efficient, only an oil change, so done quickly.  However, arrival and getting started was confusing.  The entrance and parking lot leading to the service department is cramped and no one was present outside to "greet" and advise.  My service person Kessandra was very helpful and thoughtful.  However, (again) the re-set she did of my key didn't result in a solution, which I found out later in the day when I was home.  Oddly, my dash board prompt has now told me I'm due for service AGAIN in just 1,800 miles, or just 3 weeks from now.  I don't know why it would be set to have have me come back so quickly.  Particularly since the car is very bossy about letting me know I'm supposed to go in for service, which is why I got the oil changed at just 8,100 miles.  PS  This is my first BMW.</text><user>116274677971815883514</user>< GmapID>

Purchased a 93 Honda from vista bmw and by far the worst service received. We were helped 2 weeks ago by Ryan who failed to be transparent about the risks of this car who was making us uncomfortable during the whole transaction with his comments on me and my wife’s person conversations while waiting as he sat back on his phone for nearly 2hrs. Within not even 3 weeks my transmission went out unexpectedly and the a/c was broken (as mentioned during the sale.) I called and spoke to a service rep named Barbara who told me that most Autonation cars are covered by a warranty of 90 days. Not to mention I live 2 hrs away so being clear as to what to expect was important yet every time I called, there was a new employee with a different story. So we got a hotel room and dropped my car off only to find out by Matt that it was never serviced when I dropped it off yesterday. It was not until I asked Ramon in service, that I found out there was no warranty (which he said he had no idea although he sees cars everyday and should know policies)and would have to pay for a more than likely pre existing issue. We then were sent to Anthony the sales manager who was obnoxious and easily provoked..who told me that we either pay 3.5k in repairs or finance a new car. Please keep in mind during COVID it is very nerve racking traveling to another city and also the economic hardship put on most Americans which is common sense that not everyone has the luxury of buying a new BMW. No remorse was given and little to no consideration for our concerns or situation. They were more so concerned for their profit rather than the risk of me getting into a potential fatal car accident due to the transmission if it were to go out as I’m driving 2hrs to get it looked at. By the way they said they did a full diagnostic check and never did...and almost charged me $800 for NO reason. The service manager Matt admitted their service crew does not know how to work on Honda’s because they’re too out dated.” So please don’t buy a used car from them. From the moment I made an appointment to having to drive back down to the dealer because Anthony was avoiding returning our call that the rep Alex stated he would, this was the most horrible experience in sales/customer service I’ve ever received. DO NOT COME HERE. They belittle you, discriminate, and yell at you. They judge you off of your appearance, skin color, sexual orientation and income.The only helpful person here is Morgan, she is extremely sweet no matter what. We had to deal with nearly 7 people with short temperaments that lacked empathy and concern. Run as far away as possible and do not buy a car from here.<//Review>

I have now been to this dealership probably a half a dozen time.  They do a nice job of keeping me informed and getting me out the door on time.  Braie has been my most recent service advisor and has been great.  His next door teammate has also been great.</Text>

My Service Advisor Joe Amrikhas was great throughout the entire experience.  I should also mention I don't own a BMW, but the service was fast and efficient and I'm very satisfied with the service process.  Joe was also communicative and always checked before doing work that would cost me more than the original quote I received.< /review>

The BMW technician I met at Vista BMW Vince Tinoco was awesome, very knowledgeable. Vince has a steadfast determination for excellence. We are very happy with the service of our 535d BMW.
Later I took my son's BMW 335d and I asked for Vince to work on it. The dealership was very accommodating to allow Vince Tinoco to perform service on the car. BMW of Vista and their great technician Vince are awesome, we are very happy</Review>

Service advisor Kathy Roxas was superb! She welcomed my business wholeheartedly (I showed up with no appointment). She’s very attentive and very friendly. I was even approached by a client advisor  and asked if he could offer me coffee, tea or water while waiting for my car. When I got my car back, they washed it and vacuumed the inside way better than some of the car wash places I’ve been to. My car came out showroom-ready! I was very much happy and very much satisfied with BMW of Vista’s staff and service! Thanks again, Kathy!< /review><rate>5<//rate><response>None<//response><Time>1565120935990</Time>< Pictures>

BMW of Vista Sales & Service is unparallelled! I bought my BMW i3 there in 2017. Since it is bit farther than the nearest BMW service center from my home, I serviced it the first time at the nearest BMW center to my home. I went back to service the vehicle with them out on a whim last week and I was quickly reminded why I liked them and why I will service my vehicle only with them (even if it double the distance from the nearest BMW center).< /Text>

<Review>Needed a couple of warranty items taken care, this was my first time using BMW Vista.  My service adviser was Thelma and she did a terrific job.  She arranged for a Lyft ride for me both ways and was extremely pleasant to deal with, she called me to update on the work and the car was ready when promised.  A great experience.< /Review>< username>

<text>Our experience with BMW of Vista was positive and negative. Our sales rep Austin Wallis was very nice and cordial. Negotiating a deal was also not too bad. However, we feel that our leased vehicle,  a 2020 X3, was not prepared completely for our possession. The tires were not properly inflated, we didn't know where the owner's manual was in the vehicle (it was not in the glove compartment), and there were small exterior parts in the owner's packet that we not installed prior to delivery. We are not impressed...<//text><Rating>3< /Rating>< Date>

He is also very knowledgeable about BMW's.  I would rate Sal a 5, but my overall rating is a 4 due to the lengthy purchase paperwork process.</Review>

Service advisor Brian was great. Listened to all my concerns, explained everything and kept me updated. All staff I interacted with was friendly and helpful. First time taking my 2018 M4 here, but will be back for all service/repairs. Big company owned,  but treated me like family. Glad to make the 50 minute drive to get service done. They have earned my business and any referrals.<//review>

Although I wasn't expecting it, I had a fantastic experience at BMW of Vista. I went in to test drive a 540i to compare it to a Q70. Paul greeted me and quickly found a 540i on the lot. After a decent test drive, I didn't even want to check out the Q70. I said I was planning on selling my truck first but would be willing to entertain a trade-in offer. They quickly generated an offer that I thought was acceptable. Although I didn't mention it (didn't need to), we were on a short timetable and only had roughly 3 hours to spare at the dealer. Paul was very cognizant of our time and did not delay at all for things that were in his control. They brought me a fair offer on the 540i, to which I countered. The counter was accepted with a request to get a certificate from my bank's auto buying program. BMW of Vista showed their willingness to come to a price that worked for both of us. No pressure felt and no waiting games. We were in the dealership for about 3 1/2 hours total and drove out with our new 540i. I returned the next day (I ran out of time the day of the purchase) to be taught how to operate all the functions and controls. Paul happily had one of their 'smart guys' come out and teach us.< /text>

I had a great experience with the staff at BMW of Vista. Clark, Erick, and the team were top notch. They followed up with me several times, and when I did find a couple issues with my certified pre-owned vehicle in the first week they immediately had me come in and addressed them.

I also felt the initial sales process was very professional, but the follow up is where you find out what sort of organization you are really dealing with.< /review>

Service department is very wishy-washy. They fixed my broken trim piece for free (even though it was not covered by warranty), but quoted me over $100 more for an oil change compared to another dealership service department.

I recommend getting a quote from the service department here and shopping around at other dealers, you'll probably get a better price elsewhere.< /text>

Tim Lewis, the manager, supported what was needed, and I am one happy customer.

As far as the sales person I bought my car from, Corey, during the purchase, I would have rated it a 5 star! But after the transaction, it’s all downhill from there!  On one of my calls, he hung up on me. The others promised the finance manager whom I was trying to talk to will call me back within 5 minutes or ASAP! Never happened! This is the second week I had been trying! I live 2 1/2 hours away from them! Reason I’m calling,? I’m trying to get my own money in the amount of $18,927.13 I paid before I received the financing check from my bank. We had an understanding if the bank issued a check payable to a dealership, I can bring it to them and they will refund my money back. I paid $3k through my Reward Visa card which they paid back but not the $18, 727.13 they cashed from my personal Checking account! In other word, they cashed both checks instead of refunding my money! This is an unacceptable behavior!<//Text>

Everyone at BMW Vista was great to work with. The only reason for not giving 5 Stars was the ridiculous amount of time we had to wait to get into Finance to sign paperwork. We were not financing the vehicle and expected we would be in and out fairly quickly. There was the only one finance person working and he was tied up for 2 1/2 hours with one customer, so we sat in the lobby waiting. Not my ideal place to spend on a sunny Sunday afternoon.
Other than that, everyone did and has done a phenomenal job!< /text>

I was really giving BMW vista the Benefit of the doubt,but unfortunately they did not rise to the occasion! I bought a BMW in January,also added the Total care warranty,AND a maintenance warranty.And it was all in the process of buying the car,you know the “fluff” part where the finance guy has his chance to make some extra coin on his end and how it’s sooo important and blah blah blah...And don’t get me wrong I’m sure they are important.But because of the experience I was having at that time I went ahead and bought the highest tier warranty.(You know wanna feel like your totally covered).And since January the last thing I needed from BMW Vista was a copy of these warranties.(I mean I paid for them can’t I get a copy?) Like when you go to the store and buy anything you get a receipt right? Not to mention I think between both these warranties I paid $6,000 or close to it!Ya it was $6,000 matter of fact!And the main reason other than the fact that I bought the warranties is because I wanted to know exactly what was covered and more importantly what was not.Example: I get a E-mail from BMW saying “Hey bring the car in so when can do a steering check “.Basically (alignment).So I’m under the impression that hey this is what BMW does.Look out for the customers,service is number one for them all the “fluff” and not only that I bought a top tier warranty! Right? WRONG! Basically it was a charge to see if I needed a alignment.Now if I would have had copies of my warranties I would have know this is not covered would have took my car up there etc.So yes they did the alignment for free...BUT I STILL DONT HAVE COPIES OF MY WARRANTIES!This review may seem a bit comical,but trust I am very upset.That my experience with BMW seem to go sour once the transaction was done.Its always the little things that make the biggest impact.(Example) A rock flies up from someone else tire and hits you windshield,it just a lil “nick”,next week you need a whole windshield!Very unhappy BMW owner!</Review>

This was first time that I brought in my car to get services at BMW of Vista and  I was so impressed with their customer service.  Kathy is absolutely amazing!  The first time I went in she scheduled a recall on the air bags on my BMW.  She explained the process and the work that was to be completed and then she fixed me up with a loaner car.   The mechanics found some issues that did not pass safety tests and Kathy kept me informed with the concerns.  I had explained to her that I had purchased my car at Carmax and I had purchased an extended warranty with them.  She called to verify my deductible and I was happily told that the over $2500 bill would only cost me $300!   I scheduled another appointment and I was given a loaner car while they fixed the safety issues.  I appreciate the extra attention to details that you get at BMW of Vista!  I will no longer bring my car to anybody else for repairs.  The convenience of getting a loaner, the quality of work that is done, and the customer service is top notch.  Thank you BMW of Vista and to Kathy in the service department!  I will happily be a returning customer and I will definitely be purchasing my next car with you.</review>

I bought a used car knowing it had a hissing sound associated with a wheel hub because of its advertising of a protective plan.

They will NOT start the work because the car has NOT been updated in their own computer system.

My car has been sitting for 5 business days!!!!

Honor your contract effectively...not 5 days, a month, or year down the road!< /review>< pics>

This really was a no-nonsense way to buy a car. The selling price had been reduced on my used vehicle, so that part was great. I was also caught off guard by a much higher than expected offer on my trade. These guys just want to transact, rather than quibble over pricing. I did my best but could only get an additional $250 off the deal, which I already thought was more than fair. Great experience.< /Review>

They were prompt in setting up my service and quickly identifying what needed to be don on my vehiclee but ... their prices are flout out ridiculous. It takes less than two minutes and NO tools to change a turn signal socket, they wanted 100 dollars? They also wanted 700+ for a oil filter gasket holder. This is a 10 to 15 minute job, 6 bolts, unplug the hose , drain the oil, clean it and put on the new gasket which is 10 bucks on amazon or autoparts, so not sure how much they value their labor but it's pretty dang high for simple jobs. They also wanted to swap two tires that still have at least 10k miles before they truly need to be replaced. Great customer service and very organized but they need to re-evaluate their pricing for simple jobs.< /review>

<Text>I was on a road trip and lost AC half-way through the desert. I used the texting option to conveniently set up an appointment before the dealership opened. When I came in, Joe was assigned to help. He was incredibly helpful and was able to get the car fixed in less than 2 hours. He kindly offered us a loaner car so that we could go get pedicures while we waited on the repair. He even gave a great recommendation for a pedicure spa. We came back and the car was fixed, washed and ready to go. Thank you Vista BMW!< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_id>

<text>I couldn't be more disappointed with their Service Dept.  I purchased an M5 from an AutoNation Dealer in Orange County a year ago and bought some extended service plans they offered including oil changes.  I have been to BMW of Vista three times now.  The first time I went I used one of my pre-paid oil changes, but when I got the car back I had some undercarriage panels broken.  I took it to another service center and got it fixed, I figured the car is used and those panels probably needed to be replaced.  A week later my power steering went out and I wanted a BMW dealer to fix it so I brought it back to BMW of Vista.  It was expensive as expected, but again a few days later these panels are broken again.  The service Manager explained they were missing bolts from the first time I brought it to them.  I explained to him no one said anything, how come?  I ended up taking the car back to who replaced the panels and they fixed everything free of charge and ended up replacing more panels.  Great service that I wish BMW of Vista would adopt.  a Couple months went by and my Power Steering has now failed again.  I bring the car back to BMW of Vista and they cover the part under warranty and said some other stuff needed to be replaced that they would also cover under warranty.  I had them detail the car and used another one of my pre-paid oil changes.  I received the car back with a missing wind shield wiper, broken climate control button and the passenger air bag sensor going off.  On top of all of that they charged me for my oil change.  I called and talked to my Service Adviser Braie who was great to work with and asked him to refund the expense for the oil change and told him about the other damage and explained I would never bring my car back to BMW of Vista.  Its now 3 weeks later and no refund and Braie will not return my messages...  Since they had my car for over a week last time and the air bag sensor failing I think they crashed my car and are doing what they can to cover it up.  My next step is to contact AutoNation and leave reviews like this everywhere I can.</text>< pictures>

<Pics>None<//Pics><userid>116828417869097673970< /userid><Review>I had the best experience with this dealership (in stark contrast with several other dealerships in San Diego county that I’ve visited in the preceding few weeks).

First of all, I’d like to thank the salesman Michael Wille for his expertise, honesty and transparency. He was patient and readily available to answer any of my questions.

Also, the manager Scott Clement did an outstanding job of taking care of a minor mishap that happened soon after the vehicle purchase (I am not going to get into details, but let’s just say that Mr. Clement went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied - definitely exceeded my expectations). So thumbs up to both of them! I look forward to working with Michael and Scott in the future.

When I am in the market for a new BMW I will most definitely get it from them!

After researching all the BMW dealerships in the San Diego area, BMW of Vista had the best deals, followed by BMW of Encinitas (same owner).  My salesperson was also very pleasant to work with (Michael Wille).  I highly recommend this dealership for anyone looking to purchase or lease a BMW.<//Text>

If you are considering bringing your business, DON’T. They are completely unprofessional. Sold a warranty they are not in compliance with. Will lie and say one was never bought even with proof that it was. Typical dealership that will do anything for a sale. Whatever you do, don’t come here!< /review>

Wow. First time owning a BMW.

I took my car to get it serviced and detailed at the BMW of Vista, and the employees went above and beyond for me. They have all been prompt, professional and made the whole process so easy and enjoyable. I had immediate help with car advice- following that I got my car serviced within that same week. The repair shop was able to fix my bumper and every team member stayed positive and helpful the entire time.

They took care of my needs. And still continue to-I am coming back to get a detail on Friday and can’t wait! The employees have all made me feel so taken care of. I will for sure come back to get my car serviced at this BMW for future needs, because I am so happy with the outcome!

Definitely worth the money.

BIG thanks to Evan- he has shown hands down some of best customer service I’ve seen. Thanks guys!!!!<//Review>

Kathy Kleine-Roxas is not only the service advisor closest to the entrance door, she is the least qualified to be there. She ignores customers, makes excuses, and makes her disdain for customer service known.

I have no idea how someone with such a poor attitude could be placed in this position. It would be better for the BMW dealership in Vista, CA, if they placed her in a location away from customers so she only had to deal with a minimal amount of work.

When things get busy, she gets angry and the customers suffer from her toxic attitude.</Review>

I had my bmw 325i 2006 serviced in this place and I wasn’t very happy about the outcome. Maybe i just had a bad representative or maybe my car is just too old that simple problems like wind shield wiper not working is impossible to fix. I was told that bad wiring is the cause of my wind shield wiper not to work so I said go ahead and fix it. After paying for more than $900 the wiper is still not working they said there is another problem JBE part is also bad and that is gonna cost you $1500 to fix. So I said oh my God I don’t have that kind of money right now so i will just come back later so they said ok come back whenever you are ready.

Fast forward one year later wind shield wiper still not working but i’m ok with it cause i have another car to use during rainy days. So i come back to this place for an oil change, diagnostic and recall repair. It took 17 days for my car to get the job done and it cost me more than $300. I said it’s fine i paid the fees and ran away. It was shocking really I didn’t even go 1 mile when my car started smoking. I was scared that i’m gonna burn alive So I turned around went back to repair service to see what happened. When they opened the hood the coolant were all over the engine. So the rep said no worries since it just came out of the shop we’re gonna fix it for free but you gotta pay the parts it’s gonna cost you more than $100. I said fine get it done. 1 week later I came back to pick up my car and paid for the fees and my car won’t even start. So the rep advised me to tow it away. really? 5-star service? My car may be old but it’s still very shiny and runs smoothly because I take good care of it.</text>

Only rating 1 star because I had to. My experience with this dealership was extremely frustrating from the very beginning of what turned out to be more than a month long process. From the sales man up to the General Manager, the men at this dealership are extremely pompous and rude. When you call, if they don’t answer, you can’t leave a message, they don’t return calls after they say they will update you.  Just the paperwork took more than 2 weeks, they lost our down payment, said they’d reimburse us for bank fees we were charged after having to put a stop payment on our check. They did not! They included the wrong amount of sales tax and registration fees in our loan. We had to call daily for 3 weeks and fight to get our money back we were owed. The General Manager did not care to help, we were treated as an inconvenience! I do not recommend this dealership! Horrible car buying experience.</Review>

<Text>I brought my car into BMW of Vista for recall repairs.  Everything from making the appointment to the service I received was outstanding. BMW of Vista is professional, courteous, and friendly. The repairs were completed in a thorough and timely manner.  I also was given a Courtesy Inspection and car wash. Special thanks to Service Advisor Braie Young for keeping me updated with the repairs and providing additional information when I picked up my car.  I recommend BMW of Vista Service Department because it is everything a reputable dealership should be.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Courteous, respectful staff and great customer care. Definitely less stressful to purchase the car with their fixed price policy. After purchasing the car at the advertised price,  they also took care of some service and paint issues to make sure we were completely satisfied with our purchase. I give BMW of Vista 2 thumbs up!< /review>

Fantastic experience over other BMW service locations. Rachel took care of everything and answered all the questions I had and if she didn’t know the answer, she found out for me.

Pricing for services are competitive with the area and they’re more than willing to work with you unlike the other dealership in the area.

Overall I had a great experience, the wait wasn’t too bad as they had a nice customer lounge and plenty beautiful cars to look at and sit in.

This will be the only place I bring my BMW to from now on. Great job guys!</Review>

<Review>After trying several dealerships to get the best deal a consumer can possibly get, I ended up driving 80 miles (160 miles round trip) to purchase my new 2018 BMW M3 at BMW vista.    Craig (sales associate) Erick (sales manager) and Salvatore (lease portfolio manager) were amazing and courteous throughout the experience.

If you’re trying to get the best deals for any BMW, ( I’ve had three so far) I highly recommend BMW vista regardless of the drive is out of the way.  You won’t regret it!!<//Review>< Pics>

purchasing the car was easy.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I have attempted to contact the finance department on several occasions.   All of the phone numbers are answered by an automated system.  You cannot reach a real person.  After several days of trying I selected the sales department.  They were kind enough to take a message for the finance department.  Unfortunatley they never called me back. Not sure if they got they message.    I have finally given up and  assume that they have received their payment.</review>

My 135i no longer has a warranty because it's over 100k miles. With the service I get from Brian at Vista BMW, I feel safe knowing I had dealership quality work I can always count on. I appreciate that they look out for my car and give me a heads up on issues that may come up in the near future. I've taken my car to independent shops in the past, but the quality of service on my car at Vista BMW is unmatched. They always do it right the first time and I'll never even think of taking it anywhere else.<//Review>

Very nice facility staff seem great. I just bout a nice 2014 335i and the sales guy sal was great. However I have lost all hope with the service department.  I have had only 3 experiences with the service department and each visit was a huge disappointment. first time was a recall for airbags on my 01 330i. Airbag light was on when I got it back. So I called in and the advisor began telling me nothing they did would cause that and that my car is old. Being a mechanic for 10 years I knew that was B's. I told them your mechanic could of left it unplugged or the new part could be defective. Brought the car back after 2 hours got a call that the tech left it unplugged. New car I bought had a check engine light within 2 days for evap leak in tank.  They claimed there was no leak and said it needed a battery. A week later I fill my tank to the top and gas came leaking out. Brought it back and they replaced they gas tank but left my parking brake completely loose. I fixed that myself. Even under warranty I'm not confident in brining my car here for work.<//Text>

My recently purchased 3 year old 228i had a switch that the soft touch plastic was peeling. Thelma, my service rep explained that that issue was not covered by my warranty but she would ask the service manager. Photos were taken and sent to BMW. I received an email a few days later stating that it would be covered as a good will fix. I took the car in and in an hour I had my new switch and a car wash. Thank you BMW of Vista and thank you Thelma.<//Text>

When your dealership makes mistakes, be prepared to take accountability for it. Do not lure customers with lies and deceit. Be honest with consumers about the cost of leasing and the vehicle protection plan. Sell your customers what they need, not what you WANT (That comment was thrown in for Justin). You can’t learn from your mistakes if you can’t acknowledge you’ve made them.  And boy do I have a lot of experience with BMW of Vista making mistakes at this point. A customer should not ever have to follow up with the General Sales Manager to make things right. Scott, you fixed all but this one and I am very disappointed  in you, especially since Erick agreed and  promised to get it resolved. Missteps can lead to negative reviews and, unfortunately, that’s where we’re headed. A few surprises along the way are included.<//review>

<text>This was my first experience with BMW, Vista. I dropped my vehicle off for service to address one recall. Check-in was hassle-free, thanks to Kathy. Apparently, my vehicle had a second recall, which was also addressed that same day. The reception area offered complimentary coffee and tea. BMW covered the Lyft to my employer after drop-off. Kathy also dispatched a Lyft to bring me from my employer back to BMW to retrieve my car once it was ready. BMW also washed my car, free of charge. I was so impressed with the service! It was really refreshing. Keep up the good work!<//text><Time>1560189286324<//Time><userid>115172736605490765601</userid><GmapID>0x80dc7156759f6119:0xf0a899958d30efa9< /GmapID></record>

The initial experience with the Internet Sales Manager, Ronaldo B., was lacking customer service.  He reached a negotiated price with my fiancé over email.  Since I was in town I decided to drop in and buy the car instead of waiting the following week.  He was less than pleased that I came in without an appointment. I was there at 430pm & he said he was about to leave.  He made me walk to their lot to check two cars i was interested in, instead of driving the cars by Sales. Ronaldo asked me to do a credit check even before I test drove the car. Ronaldo also condescendingly asked "you haven't driven an X5?" (I have of course that's why I want to buy one) He said "it is new!"  I insisted to drive the actual car I want to take home.  I thought that was logical. Ronaldo seemed impatient & eventually left and turned me over to David Lopez.

David Lopez was excellent! It makes a big difference when a person especially in Sales greets you with a smile. He was easy to deal with & knowledgeable with the product.  Although there was a 45 minute wait for the Finance Department David made sure myself & my family where comfortable waiting.

Kyle at Finance Department was also pleasant to deal with.

Thank you Kyle & David Lopez!< /text>

<Text>Reason #1 why not to buy a BMW.   You assume it has a free oil change when you buy it slightly used (only 1 year old)  BUT they fail to tell you that any service warranty (even free oil changes) are immediately cancelled once you buy it from another private party.   Then all the service guys are obviously commission based so they are trying to overcharge on parts and service.   WELL DESERVED 1 STAR GUYS.</Text><user_id>116373011289828309177</user_id>< rate>

But being charged for repairs not properly completed (did you even drive the car?!) and then trying to get a hold of someone after the fact is impossible. Who's the GM there? So I would highly recommend not going here. Unless you like being charged for repair work not done, or done properly, and not having anyone who could care less. DO NOT COME HERE. THESE GUYS ARE TERRIBLE. Really wanted to avoid this but it seems they really just don't care. I will however strongly suggest taking a few extra minutes in your drive and head to BMW of Escondido. It's worth it.<//review>< Pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Worst experience ever! I made an appointment with seasoned salesman Corey Hayward for my next BMW experience. He had been calling and emailing me for a while, so I thought I would give him an opportunity. We talked on the phone, I made clear what I was looking for and he assured me that they will have the car I want for a test drive. I arrived and I had to clarify why I was there for, clearly he had no idea of what we talked on the phone. Then, he sent me with a young man for a BMW driving experience. I was expecting to drive what I was there for: a 2018 X5. Instead, I drove a used 2015 X5 and had to imagine all the upgrades the young man was describing. I was taken to a second parking lot far from the dealership, a dirt lot, to take a look only to new X5's. Back to the car dealership, Corey wanted to literally sell me a car that I didn't drive and that they didn't show me. Who does he think he was dealing with? I should mention that only one other person was looking for a car that day and at that time. Everyone else was doing nothing. They had plenty of human resources to assist me and cars to show me, but they made a big mistake. I will take my business and money to someone who deserves it. Stay away from Corey Hayward and from BMW Vista. It was a waste of my time.</review>< Gmap_id>

Great experience at BMW of Vista and I got a great deal! All the details were negotiated ahead of arrival to pickup the car and they were fast and helpful. They were not pushy at all and very responsive. Eddie and Scott were fantastic!

I visited BMW of Vista after I had both my passenger tires ruined by a massive pothole. It happened on a Saturday and it was our first day of our vacation in SoCal. Lucky for us, the dealership was near by so I didn’t have to drive far with two bad tires.
Our service advisor was extremely helpful and empathetic to our situation. He quickly got us a loaner and we were on our way.
The repair was done by the following Monday afternoon. New tires, clean car, happy customer.

Thank you!<//text>

Was on my way to work when the oil service light appeared on my BMW indicating the vehicle was very low on oil and should not be driven very far.  Immediately brought it to BMW of Vista and was greeted by Kathy Kleine-Roxas from their Service Dept.  Without an appointment they took my BMW in, gave me an estimate for the cost to service and provided me with a loaner so I could get to work that morning.  The vehicle was repaired that day and the actual cost was less than the estimate.  Kathy was very professional, friendly and great to work with.  Very please with my experience with this dealership and their service dept.< /Text>

We purchased a 2006 Ford Mustang from Mossy BMW of Vista.   Very helpful right from the start to the very end.  From the first telephone call to find out details about the car, the video of the car, personal test drive of the car, the sale of the car, to the easy transaction of paper work - Nick made the car purchasing enjoyable.  The car was immaculate. My daughter loves the car.  She is so excited to drive it. Great experience at Mossy BMW of Vista - everyone was very helpful and friendly.< /Text>

< review>
Bought a CPO 228i M-Sport from BMW Vista back in August. Jovan was very helpful with providing information and booked my appointment which blocked the car from anyone else. As Vista is a bit of a drive from Orange County, this was very much appreciated.
The car looked good, was in great shape and was priced so well I thought it was a price mistake.  Purchase process was fast and painless. Their warranty/services upsell system was down so I think that helped lol

At final delivery we discovered the 2nd set of keys was missing, but within a couple weeks the sales manager Erick and Jovan had mailed to me a brand new set. Getting that post-sales service was a nice touch and very appreciated. I would recommend the team at BMW Vista (soon to be BMW Carlsbad, they are merging with BMW Encinitas) to anyone looking for a stress free buying experience. I was skeptical of no haggle dealerships before but these guys blew it out of the water.< /review>

This place is absolutely terrible. They should be shut down for the simple fact that they DO NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY. WILL NEVER BUY A CAR FROM AGAIN AND WILL MAKE SURE NONE OF MY FRIENDS OR FAMILY BUY FROM HERE EITHER.<//Text>

I went in looking to see what they had to offer, there was no pressure to purchase, it was a laid back atmosphere and very polite and professional.
Corey Hayward is my Client Advisor and helped get everything taken care of.  I have had questions and I call, Corey or Ricky are there with out any hesitation to see that I get my answers as quickly as possible. The staff at BMW of Vista is second to none!!<//Text>

Called the service department for an issue with the battery for my BMW 3 series. The representative Jared was  accommodating. Received a same day appointment.
Turns out the battery was fine. Jared then informed me that service maintenance was due and my car was completely taken care of from new front brakes to air filters. The service was efficient and  thorough.
The staff at BMW of Vista is always knowledgeable and friendly!< /review>

Imagine my surprise when I received an email notification that I had transacted nearly $200 with a BMW service company in Southern California only a couple weeks after visiting there!
After I calmed down, I saw that there is a Kelley.

My husband and I went in to look at an X5 at BMW of Vista.  After looking at the car and talking things over with Justin, we ended up buying an i3 electric vehicle.  Justin was super knowledgeable about the vehicle and extremely helpful and professional in all aspects of the deal.   We would definitely go back to that location just to do a transaction with him.</Review>

From my initial contact with our Sales Rep, Clark, to the management, to the service dept, my experience at Vista BMW has been nothing but stellar.  I love the no hassle, no haggle price policy on CPO cars.  My online trade-in valuation was a breeze and they didn't mess with the quote given. The finance manager was also a pleasure to work with. I purchased an extra year of added CPO warranty and an extra year of Prepaid Maintenance and was treated professionally and with respect.  The 528 that I wanted was located at a different Autonation dealer and my Sales Rep, Clark,  took four hours of his workday to drive and deliver my new car - amazing!  Ask for Clark and expect a great experience!< /Review>< pictures>

<time>1553815550703<//time><text>Terrible customer service. First, my less than 1.5 year old 2017 340i has had too many issues to count, was in service first week purchased. Have had multiple issues with vehicle, just haven't dealt with dealership to remedy all issues. Trunk continues to pop open for no reason. Second, have been paying tire warranty monthly. Found out rear tire had nail it it a few months back, called dealership to schedule repair. Representative informed me (after I explained I was busy at work and the dealership is located 45 min away) that there was no rush because it is covered under warranty and if the tire pressure isn't low, dealership can replace tire anytime. After having to leave vehicle with dealership for a recall on the model (after waiting two weeks from their initial recall notification), I ask dealership to replace my tire per the warranty. Dealership refuses claiming I am required to pay full price and the tread on tire is just below the allowable limit under the warranty - probably because I was instructed by the representative to wait and not rush. Dealership also lets me know I need all 4 new tires because after just 14k miles, the tread is low... possible, but doubtful. Nonetheless, they offer - after multiple complaints - a proposal to resolve the dispute that is unacceptable. Finally, after I accept the proposal, the dealership refuse to accommodate me given the distance and issues with them before and offer me a complimentary loaner vehicle- as if that isn't offered to everyone and anyone who leases/buys a BMW. In fact, Joe, represented to me that a loaner vehicle in my case was optional and a perk not offered to many. This was a lie, clearly.

Ultimately, BMW has lost my business now and in the future because they are no longer a "luxury" brand offering "luxury service." I will no longer purchase/lease a BMW - definitely not with BMW of Vista and will never recommend a BMW or this dealership to anyone. BMW may not care about my (long standing good history with the company - with multiple BMW vehicles) and that's fine. BMW and BMW of Vista's lack of interest in retaining my business and keeping me satisfied - even though my requests are not unreasonable - is evidence that BMW is no longer a luxury car brand. POTENTIAL BUYER STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.< /text><rating>1< /rating>< user_id>

Worse Experience ever! I wish i could give them zero star. First, i was over charged for an oil change. The used an after market part and overcharged me. I was told the service light could not be reset, which was lies. I was able to reset the service light. Lastly, I was charged for standard scope which i refused but was still charged.

PS: I have been refunded the standard scope after called by the manager< /Text>

It has been a great experience working with the team at BMW Vista.  They provide a superior level of service and I have felt well taken care of from the first call I made.  I spoke to Francisco, who understood my style and what I was looking for and the following day helped me find the car that was the perfect fit. Jay in finance made sure I stayed within my budget while adding some additional care items I had hoped for. Braie and Evan in the service department have been extremely helpful in ensuring that after the purchase was made the level of care and service continues. It has been an overall really enjoyable experience working with them and I would definitely recommend BMW Vista to my friends or family.< /Text>

<review>There is nothing lower on my list, as a woman, than car shopping.  But I got really lucky when I chose to go to BMW of Vista. I wanted a used i3, and I was fortunate to find Eddie Villaruz for my salesman. What a really pleasant experience all around - he answered all my questions (or got the answers), and was great about communicating via emails,texts and phone calls.  And the other support staff there were wonderful as well.

This is a great place to do business - they treat you fairly and with respect.  You can't ask for more.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1502798060038, 'text': 'Sandra, we are happy you had a pleasant experience overall with Eddie and the rest of our team here at BMW of Vista.

I still have warranty support so I brought it to Rachael at BMW Vista to have it replaced.  During the process, the technician found a key lodged in the player.  I was surprised that the other dealer did not catch this in the CPO process, as the CD functions were marked as "tested."  Rachael and her team were very helpful in providing a favorable solution that involved BMW and the other dealer so that the problem was fixed and I left happy.

I didn't a pleasant experience at Vista BMW. The upper management kept giving me incorrect information about the financing and warranty on the car!  I've always leased new cars in the past so when I decided to purchase a used car it was important to have the financing and the warranty terms explained to me properly instead I was told extremely different information from various mangers and the sale rep that made me feel uncomfortable so decided to get an extended warranty to made sure the car is covered! Additionally I ended up paying over 70K for a car that didn't have floor mats! Upper management didn't even try to make the experience better for me to make up for all the errors they made other than offer me a $60 dollar BMW license plate frame for the car! The only reason why they got my business is because the car had the features that I was looking for and I was at the end of my lease and I couldn't afford to be without a car. I traveled a 100 miles one way to do business with a dealership that I felt didn't appreciate my business.<//text>

Some of the rudest people u will come across. Shady n dishonest. They'll tell u they have what ur looking for when u call them. I drove 60 miles they didn't have the car they said they did🤬 Cory was so Arrogant and rude and a lier!! Stay away from this dealership.< /Review>

<text>I had a great experience at Vista BMW. On a recent night trip down from The Bay Area I lost my headlights. When I showed up at Vista they brnt over backwards to locate new bulbs from a dealer 60 miles away, gave me a loaner (I3) and dispatched someone to go get them. When they realized they would not be able to finish the repairs by the end of the day they called switched out my loaner (X3). My X5M was ready at 9:30 the next morning. Excellent service, competent, accommodating, friendly service personnel. It would almost be worth coming down here from the Bay Area the next time I need service. Thank you very much for a five ⭐️ service experience!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Had a Great experience with this Dealership! Came in looking for a newer 3 series and Mike helped me leave the lot with a 328i! Enjoyed test driving the different years and models and left with a 3 series that matched my needs! They were very patient and helpful throughout the whole process.

So I've been sick, and have had to cancel 2 or 3 appointments to get my Tecata airbags replaced due to a recall .
After speaking with Thelma in customer service at BMW of Vista she arranged with the manager to come pick up my BMW from my home.
They completed the recall replacement work and returned my car to me freshly washed, and with a smile. And it was pulled it into the garage for me!!
Vista BMW treated me so very kindly.
Thelma was a doll, and I'm very grateful for her kindness and her going above and beyond to ensure my safety.
Thank you Thelma, we need more people like you in the world ..
Best wishes,
S. Musso</review>

Overall, I've been satisfied with their ability to meet my service needs and keeping my vehicle running in top condition.   I've been disappointed though that I've not always been treated with the utmost level of respect during interactions.  Examples include being interrupted when offering suggestions and when they've minimized/downplayed their minor mistakes.  Since no one is perfect, a simple apology or willingness to listen to a customer can go a long way towards shaping a customer's perception of receiving superior service.  The little things matter.< /review>

Wonderful experience with BMW of Vista. I was really upside down on my current car but they were able to get me the car I wanted at a reasonable payment given my negative equity. My product consultant was Aaron Passarelli. He was really helpful and even stayed until 10 PM to help finish my deal. Will definitely be back to BMW Vista when it's time to get my next car.<//text>

I've leased and bought over 6 cars in my lifetime and the experience at this dealership was by far the most pleasant. The salesman, Ryan Littlefield, I worked with was not only readily available but a really nice guy. The Manager, Jessica, was also super rad and great to work with. I highly recommend this BMW shop! My new X5 is amazing and I will certainly be a returning customer.<//review>

We had never leased before, only purchased. Nicolas Torres explained the entire leasing process to us very clearly, and answered all of our questions thoroughly. He then showed us a few cars that were in line with what we wanted, and gave us multiple options, explaining all of the available features that were offered. When we decided on a car, the financing process was smooth and relatively quick. We got a very fair price for our trade in, and although we weren't necessarily planning on driving a new car away that day, that's exactly what we did. Nicolas made it so easy and comfortable. We are extremely happy with the car, the experience, and with Nicolas himself. The next day, they even called us back and said that BMW had found us a better rate. We came back in and re-signed the lease at a slightly lower rate, saving us a little more money. We will definitely be going back to Mossy and Nicolas Torres for all future BMWs.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>Craig was a superb salesperson. I had never considered owning a BMW before. After doing a test drive with Craig, I now realize that all the other test drives I've taken at other dealers were, in reality, just hyped up "ride-alongs." In addition, he has a knowledge and a genuine passion for the BMW line which is infectious. It is clear his desire is to get people to love driving BMW vehicles, not just buy them. I most definitely now do love driving my new BMW!

He was also very accommodating and gracious in working with my schedule and communication methods (I'm an emailer/texter). Also, I found it refreshing how open, honest and brief the finance department was about add-ons (extended warranty, etc).

One note: it is still a dealership and, no matter who the salesperson is, they still work for the sales department- make sure to get all guarantees and agreements clear and in writing... I didn't, and that led to an issue post-purchase.<//Text><user>114375123061422486803<//user>< Name>

Nick and the manager were extremely understanding and helpful to me, while I was deciding whether or not I would make the purchase. They were honest about the conditions of the car and the buying process was easy and simple. Also, with it being an older, used car it has been running great without any problems.

This is the second vehicle I have purchased here. I have been shopping for a few months for the right car and the right people to purchase from, and I ended up back here for the service. They did not try to upsell me or talk me into anything. Price was on par with what I had wanted/expected to pay. Thank you Clark and Eric.</Text>

<review>Brought in our X5 for routine oil change.
Addn'tl call out from us were:
1. Squeaky brakes
2. Broken windshield wiper

Oil change was fine and no issues there.
1. Brakes - was told squeak was due to brake dust. - will clean brakes myself as plenty of meat still left on pads. No issue here.
2 . Wipers - dealership did not replace wiper as they said was not covered, but were replaced last time we brought it up for regular scheduled maintenance. Not sure what that was about honestly.

Overall okay with service. Not happy that loaner vehicles are not longer part of their service. Will consider BMW of Encinitas next time to gauge whether to change dealership for regular service.</review>< pics>

I have an old bmw, (01) but they still took care of me like I just bought one. Very friendly, lobby was comfortable while I waited, told me what I needed to know. If there was anything negative to say, it might be the wait time, but it wasn't outrageous. Great place.< /review>

<Text>We went here twice and made a great deal for a 328I. My salesman, Paul Amini, was very reasonable and made my deal work with the second visit. He honored all our sales agreements and made sure we were well taken care of. He even threw in an extra free of charge because it was my wife's birthday. I am now a BMW fan and I know where to get my next BMW.< /Text>< name>

< Review>
I have driven BMW’s since 1999. My first purchase was at Crevier BMW in Orange County, and my salesman Jerry Barnes was amazing! Since then, it was disappointment one after another dealing with several dealerships. However, Vista BMW changed all that! BMW Vista far exceeded my expectations! Mike Wille Salesman was the answer to my prayers! He got me into my awesome 7th BMW, my 430i Coupe! Anyone looking for top 5 Star, 5 Diamond service ask for Mike, he helped find my dream car,! He’s professional, hard working, sense of humor, and knowledgeable! Mike knows BMW’s, inside and out! Casandra Service  Representative, just like Mike, all that he is, she’s the best customer service person I’ve ever had! Tim the Service Manager, again, another 5 Star Employee, bent over backwards to help me, and on a Saturday no less!! I pass 2 other dealerships to go to Vista BMW, round trip it’s a 70 mile drive, and worth it! Thank you Team for taking care of me and my car!< /Review>

Brian is the ideal service advisor you always hope you'll work with.  I'm so thankful for meeting him and I'm sure you will too when you bring your BMW into service.  He's highly personable, professional, and great at communicating.  It doesn't hurt that he's an M guy like myself. To sum it up-PEACE OF MIND.  Thanks Brian.<//Text>

Worst dealership to buy a used car from. Couldn't even drive the car off of the lot due to a bad gear shift. Said they would fix it, along with other bodywork they said they'd fix and didn't, so we came back the next day. Still couldn't drive the car. The manager told us the gear shift wasn't in the 30 day warranty even though they'd agreed to fix it the day before. We still have to stick a screwdriver into the shift release to move the car. Make sure you read the fine print. I will never buy another car from them again, in fact, I didn't. I went to car country Carlsbad for our family vehicle. Far better service.<//review>

The airbag recall was performed on my car, it took longer than said it would and I had to send it back because the airbag wasn't even all the way into the steering wheel and I noticed some scratches on my steering wheel from the job. I asked for the scratches to be fixed or part repaired and the service advisor said he would speak to his manager and get back to me, it has been 4 days now and I haven't heard anything back.</review>

<text>As an experienced former BMW dealership employee in the Bay Area, I can tell you that this dealership does everything wrong. I purchased a brand new 3 series here and once the deal is done, they're done with you. No email responses, no call backs, not even an answer to whether or not my vehicle has been registered. The first and only service appointment I had was made online, weeks in advance, stated that I would wait for my oil change and it took over 2 hours! I wasn't even greeted in the service drive.

Highly recommend going somewhere else for any dealership needs.<//text>< date>

<text>Shame on BMW! They refused to pay for a  blown out amplifier. They claimed water spilled on it thru the trunk?? By the way I have a custom rubber liner that sits in the trunk. Put it thru an investigation..After 4 weeks They still refused.. Cost me over 1800.. only 20K in miles on the car..

The only reason for the 2 stars is that the service manager Braei was super kind and sweet.. He has great customer care.  They did detail my car because they knew how upset we were.. Bought 3 BMWs over the past 3 years.. Doubt we will ever purchase another or refer any of our friends or family to buy one either.. Not worth it.

There was no hassle and everything went smoothly with our purchase. We were treated poorly at BMW Escondido so we were happy to be welcomed and treated with respect at BMW Vista. Thank you!!< /review>< pictures>

Have had a very good experience every time I visit this dealership for service on my m3. The service advisors are polite and personable. They don’t try to sell you on the repairs needed more just make you aware and ask what I want to do. Had a nice waiting area with decent coffee machine. Also never had an issue getting a loaner vehicle, I always ask for one when making my appointments via the phone.< /text>

And that the service will take 2 hours. Next thing he calls and says it will cost $500 to change my Xenon light bulb, so I asked him not to do it. He then asks me to pay $175 for the inspection of my light bulb, which he never mentioned prior to dropping off my car. I insisted that I won't pay that money since I asked him twice not do to anything until I know how much it will cost, also because I already told him that I need to change a lightbulb. He then says they'll put the headlight back in and calls to me to pick up the car, he never calls back for almost 6 hours, and when I called back they said my car was ready. Gave me attitude when I went to pick up my car as well. Very disappointed at the service.</review><time>1553884089098<//time><rating>1< /rating>< Name>

< review>
Staff was very helpful and attentive. Did not have to wait long for the shuttle car while service was being done. Complimentary orange juice and water bottles are a nice touch and the lobby is not a bad place to spend half an hour browsing or looking at their showroom cars. Take a seat in the new i8 it feels very futuristic.< /review>

Brian Chartier is my Service Advisor and is Great!
He is always on top of every service and has great communication to make sure you are informed of what to expect.

This particular time, I was on vacation and he told me to call at least an hour to arriving at the dealership to have my car washed before I picked-up my vehicle.
Well, I did just that on Monday, 3/27/17.  The advisor on the phone told me it would be ready.
When I arrived to pick-up my car, it was Not washed and the floor mats looked horrible.  It looked worse than when I dropped it off.
Due to Brian being on Vacation, Francisco Pugeda helped me out and had  the car cleaned immediately and the mats shampooed.  He went above and beyond to take care of a trivial matter and Kudos for him on being such a great help.  He was Awesome!
I have never had a problem with all my services through the years at BMW VISTA.  This review was to help Auto Nation the new owners of the Vista BMW, so that the Auto Cleaning Service Department does Not have this happen again in the future.</text>

I have had my car serviced by BMW of Vista for over 18 months and
they have treated me with the utmost of respect and given me amazing service.
Don Eckker makes the process so easy and pleasant
I would recommend BMW of Vista without reservation.

I worked with the Internet Sales Manager Ray Smith, and was pleasantly surprised with my overall experience with him and the dealership. Ray knew just what I wanted and he came through in a professional and natural style that will not be forgotten. I have already told several friends about Mossy BMW of Vista. Class act operation and not your typical car dealership. I've been a customer at other BMW and Mercedes dealerships and there is no comparison here. These guys are super cool and laid back enough to have a good time! I even get free lifetime car washes. Now that's a cool place!< /review>

<review>I purchased a 2011 CPO BMW 328i coupe from Mossy BMW Vista and had an EXCELLENT SALES EXPERIENCE.  My sales person was RAY SMITH who is very new to BMW; however, what he lacked in product detail he more than made up for with his sincere, friendly customer-centric manner.  I'm thrilled with the car and was thrilled with the sales experience and would highly recommend.<//review>< Name>

<text>I will never buy a BMW again, I’m extremely upset with the 320i 2014. I’ve had the car for 3 years fresh of the lot and I have had so many issues with it. On top of that out of the 8-10 times I’ve brought it in for service I was able to get a loner car once. I regret buying this car every single day I’m in it.

We had a very pleasant experience, the salesman (Ricky) was very knowledgeable and not pushy at all which is refreshing, he spent almost the entire morning with us comparing vehicles used vs new options and even showing us his personal vehicle.  I'm not sure when and which BMW (20+ year BMW owner)  I will buy next but it will be at this dealership.<//Text>

<username>Spymummie C</username><text>Horrible experience!!! Waste of our valuable time. We called and made an appointment for 8:30 to test drive a car. Drove almost an hour to see the car. We were there on time but the sales manager turned us away because it was too late for them. Disrespectful of customers’ time!!!
The manager was rude. Didn’t even bother to greet us and left us standing outside in the cold with young children. I think it’s because we were looking to buy a used car so it was not worthy of his time.

Also this dealership is SHADY and DISHONEST. We called to see 2 different cars. We were informed that both cars were clean and had no blemishes. When we saw the cars they both had major cosmetic dents and scratches from some sort of accidents that were very visible.  They didn’t disclose any of those information even when asked on the phone.

Don’t ever buy from this dealership.  The manager in a blue sweater who worked on the evening of 12/19 treat customers looking for a used cars as second class citizens. This was my first experience with a BMW dealership. What an embarrassment for a dealership to have someone like him as a manager!  What kind of example is he setting for the rest of the staff members? You should treat all your customers with equal respect!
I have owned several Mercedes and a Maserati and this was by far the worst experience from any dealership I have been to. Unprofessional in so many levels!</text><rating>1< /rating>< userid>

<Text>They did a great job...period.  Very unlike the usual "shady dealership" experiences I've ha in the past.  I bought a Ford Mustang and this is  BMW dealership, yet they treated me as though I was purchasing the latest M series.  No hard sales tactics and no up-selling in finance; fair, honest, personal, and professional are the only words I can use to describe my experience.  Jovan did a great job of moving us all through the process.  I wish my short-term memory could recall the mangers name because he was also a cut above.  I wish I was a Beemer guy, I'd buy all of my cars from these folks.<//Text>< Response>

<Text>Part replacement was done well, and fully restored vehicle capability.  However, disappointed with information sharing.  After turning the vehicle to you on a Thursday and expecting to be notified of results, I had to make the contact late that day to determine problems.  Was told that a part needed to be ordered and would arrive the next day.  Again, the next day, I received no notification from you as to status.  Late that day I called again to ascertain status, was placed on hold, lost the hold, had to call again, and was finally told that the repair was not completed.  Again, on Saturday, I had to call to determine when the repair would be completed.  Finally told it could be picked up in one hour.  Suggest your representatives improve on communication with customers.  Should not be up to the customer to keep contacting to determine status.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I bought a 650i yesterday from Mossy BMW and  I have to say my experience was simply amazing. I saw the car on sunday night and called on Monday morning to get more information. I ended up talking to Ray Smith and I have to say he was the best dealer I worked so far. He was friendly, understanding and most importantly honest from start to finish. when I came to the dealership everything went really smoothly. Ray already did most of the paper work when I arrived to the dealership and the car was already detailed. I was really happy with what I got for the price I paid. I will recommend Ray Smith and Mossy BMW to my friends or anyone who is interested in buying a BMW. Even though its a long drive its well worth it. Thank you Ray and the Mossy BMW team.<//text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>Now I have two poor experience with the service department at BMW Vista.  The first was with my electrical system.  I had to bring the car in three times.  The first two time  the service managers kept saying that I was letting my battery run out by not locking my car up totally when I park in my garage.  I kept telling them that that did not seem plausible because things were acting very strangely.  I had to have another opinion by another service department and they fount that it was faulty CPU.  My next experience was when I authorized work that they suggested.  They let me keep the loaner for the next day, but then when I did not get a call from the service department, I had to call them.  To my surprise, the work that I authorized did not even get started.  There was definitely poor communication between the staff members in that department.  I will not be using their service department again.

Unfortunately, I bought my car there and the sales department was great.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

I absolutely loved my experience buying a pre-owned BMW thanks to Eddie Villaruz! He takes dealer job to the next level, I really felt that he cared that I get the car that I want and would enjoy, rather than just making a sell. Thank you Eddie!<//text>

Crickets, Beuller? Avoid this Dealership at all cost! @Autonation owns this dealership and BMW of Encinitas.

**UPDATE 3/20/19** Received a call from sales manager, apparently, the GM receives 600 emails a day and doesn’t have time to call customers back. Per Sales manager. Done with  Autonation, BMW of Vista and BMW of Encinitas.

Pretty devastating experience at BMW of Vista for my wife and I.  I'm sure the response will be it was a misunderstanding but this was no misunderstanding, I assure you.

On 02/16/19 we stopped by BMW of Vista to look at cars, specifically the SUV styles.  After test driving an X1 we found a certified pre-owned X5 and test drove that.  We liked it so much that, Larry the sales associate, allowed us to take it home for a night.  At that time Larry said he would go into the website and remove it so it would not be shown online for other potential buyers.  When we brought the car back we did not have a lot of time so he gave us a couple of options, we could start the process now or come back.  We chose the option to start the process now and finish up two days later on Wednesday.  We leave so we could clean out our trade in.

Fast forward to Wednesday mid afternoon, my wife, shows up to finish the deal and the car is missing? Excuse me, the car is missing?  As they're trying to find the car my wife over hears that the GM, yes the General Manager of both BMW of Vista and Encinitas has purchased it for his daughter.  Are you kidding me?  The GM comes in and takes the car for his daughter?  This should not have happened!  Where was the communication between Erik (the fiance manager) and the sales associate?

Some may say buy another X5... Well, this was the car we wanted- price was right, it was customized to our liking, rims, interior and had the 3rd row option that we really liked!

Currently they're trying to find us a car.... it's not that easy,which is what makes this so frustrating! so we are not sure if we will take this beyond a Google review.  Ultimately, I would like to update this review with something positive, time will tell!

Sorry BMW of Vista/Encinitas to put you on blast but this was absolutely ridiculous!

Called and left a message for the GM. No call back!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1550975511133, 'text': "Paul, it's upsetting to hear that you did not receive the top-notch service we strive to provide.

I was looking for a used BMW 3 series and I got the price for 2007 model mixed up with 2006 model's price and I made an offer that made one of your associates very mad and he called me "crazy". It was the worst phone call I ever had with anyone in my life.</Text>

Needed to bring my BMW in for unplanned warranty work nothing major but more of an annoyance. I called the service department on two different occasions within the last two months. They where able to get me in the same day and gave me a loaner vehicle on both occasions. The service staff is top notch.<//text>

This is my second lease from BMW of Vista and based upon both of these my  experience with them has been excellent.  Personnel in all departments recently, Braie , of the Service Dept.was courteous and attentive to my needs regarding loaner transportation.  His suggestion that the time to complete my service was short and even though I had a loaner approved, I might consider waiting.  I did and the wait was as quoted, short, including a wash
I have had 6 BMW's and BMW of Vista is my preferred dealership. even though  it is a 20 minute ride from my residence.</review>

<Review>Over the phone they asked me if I needed a loaner car while my car was being worked on. I said yes, when I got there, the man asked if I was 21 and I said no. He said I couldn’t have a loaner car unless I was at least 21. Would’ve been nice if they had let me know over the phone. They also told me it was going to be over $2,000 to fix an oil leak and they still charged me $150 just to look at the car. Never got any paperwork either. This place sucks!< /Review>< Time>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>This is a newer BMW dealership.  They don't seem to have their act together in the Service department.  A trim piece needed to be ordered for my car.  They told me they ordered it that day and would call me when it is here.  A month later I decided to check in and check the status.  They told me they have no record of the order.  They ordered it once again.  I checked in a month after that.  Same story, they lost the order and are ordering it again.  It's been 3 months now and no word of the part.  My friend bought a car from them.  They could not locate the spare key so ordered one for him.  It's been 2 months for him now and there is still no key.  His new license plate didn't come either.  He keeps calling also and same story, "We'll look into it".  I don't know what Mossy is doing, but they surely don't know how to run a BMW dealership.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>The 3 star is because they are too expensive on bmw parts but the staff on the parts department are wavy nice especially Jeremy he is professional and respectful. All cars are all plastic and BMW is no defent then any other car I've been driving BMW all my life and the BMW's of today are not what they are before 2000's I do give 5 stars Jeremy tho.  Thanks Jeremy I'll come see you this Saturday.  Best regards

<text>I wish I could give 10 Stars!! This dealership offers the BEST in  customer service not to mention inventory. Totally restored my faith in the car buying process. From start to finish is was a great experience. I never felt pressured, and always  treated with respect. I HIGHLY recommend all of the staff,  specifically  Daniel Trefzger, he found me EXACLY what I wanted at an UNBELIEVABLE price ..THOUSANDS below other local dealers. All around I rate Vista BMW a 10 out of 10. Except for that one manager who is a fan of the New York Yankees. :)<//text>< Rate>

<Text>The BMW vista "service" department is terrible! I had my Z4 serviced there last year, had booked a "I will wait for oil service" appointment and had to "wait" for over 2 hours. I had a few questions and received a very rude, I am not "interested" response, trying to get me out of the door. Today, I thought to give them a second chance and called to set-up an appointment. I asked how much it would be for an oil service and she hung up on me! Twice! Will never call or go there again.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>This dealership sold me a car and gave me the wrong warranty terms.
Next, they do not return emails or calls to handle important matters once the sale is done.
They still cannot update me if my car is registered yet.
I'm forced to take to the internet because they do not respond.
I don't ask for much, just what I paid for and a call or email back.  Buy somewhere else.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Fixed my i3 but the service and communication has been consistently subpar.

I took my car in on a Monday. Received a call on Wednesday telling me it would be ready that afternoon and I’d get another call.

Did not hear anything back until the following Tuesday when I called and was told my car would be ready, again, that day. This time it was but when I went to pick it up I was missing a quarter tank of gas and the battery was nearly completely drained. It was 7:00pm and I need almost a full charge to get home from Vista.

Overall it’s fairly painful to deal with this dealership as an owner of an electric BMW. They have no idea how the Flex program works even though they offer it. The service loaners are always ICE cars or SUVs so I need to budget $50-$60 a week for gas that after years of owning an i3 I’m not used to budgeting. Also your car will be there a week. At least.

If you drive an electric BMW take your car to El Cajon for service. They are extremely knowledgeable about the i-series cars and programs available and will usually at least give you a 330e as a loaner if not an i3 if you take your i3 or i8 in.< /Text>< Pics>

Ray arranged to have the car brought to me from Vista to Lake Forest, since I was working from home that day and I typically work in Los Angeles. I got to test drive the car from home, then the next day Ray arranged to have all of the loan and paperwork delivered and signed at my home. He then delivered the car right to me. Ray you rock!

I am very disappointed with their customer service. After my first visit and talking to the sales guys to tell them what I was looking for (BMW I3), they sent me specs and pricing on an BMW I3 that I liked via email. On my scheduled second visit to check out the car, they told me it had been sold already, why they didn't tell me so before I make that trip to the dealership??
So after that fiasco they tried showing me a second I3, which they thought they had in their parking lot, guess what.. Sold too.. Obviously these guys have a problem with their inventory system not keeping up to date. So they showed me a third option, which I agreed to check out, they told me they would have it there in a couple of hours since it was in Buena Park, CA.  I came back a third time after they called me to check out the car, the car wasn't there yet when I arrived, the driver was still stuck in traffic 45 minutes away from the dealership.

OK, so I was very upset but the car looked great, however it was late that night and the service department had gone home already. The sales guy told me that they were going to send it to detail for me and told me to come back the next day, after a frown face from my part, the guy told me they would deliver it to my address. I asked him about the 5 day money back warranty, how would that apply if I'd be signing the papers today but the car would be delivered the next day, he said the warranty starts when you take possession of the car, which made sense.
I wen't to sign the papers with the financing manager and when we got to the part of the 5 day warranty he said it would start from today.... I said that it didn't make sense since I was not taking the car with me that night... at what he replied... the warranty starts the day you sign the papers, besides we are not required to cover you for 5 days, we are giving this to you. What a freaking low blow man, that right there tells you what kind of people this guy is.

OK, after all that I still decided to go through with the purchase. So they told me I would have the car Next day in the afternoon. You guessed right.. they didn't show up until 8.30 PM with the car. With No Battery Charge.. (it's an electric car) and lacking detail, as they said that was the reason for the hold up.

Now.. after a few days of driving the car, I found the Dash board flickers and the sound system has a hiss noise on the background. I called them to let them know today around noon.. which they said that their service department would call me back to schedule an appointment. It's 6 pm and I haven't heard from them yet.

<text>I live in Orange County but I can say that BMW of Vista is my go to dealership for my BMW needs.  It is absolutely worth the drive down to get the car I want at a price that can’t be beat.

I was in the market for an Alpina B6 and they had the one that I wanted.  I dealt primarily with salesman Eddie and manager Scott Clements and they took good care of me.  I had all my pricing, contracts, add ons all set before I even set foot in the dealership.  Car was derailed and took me about 15 minutes I’m finance to sign all the papers.  Easily the best experience I’ve had.

I know I got the best deal on this car because the only other dealership that was able to even get close enough to match the offer was still off by a good amount (more than $1000).

I had such a great experience I’ve referred all my friends and family to this dealer as well.  My colleague just got into an x5 with them at a deal that couldn’t be beat.  He initially shopped the deal at a local dealer who laughed and said it was a scam.  That’s how good these guys will work with you to make sure you’re happy with the deal.

Can’t say enough about the great customer care and pricing I received.  Going back next week to get an m550.  Again...shopped the deal around to some of the big local dealers and no one was close...again.  Don’t waste your time and ask for Scott and Eddie right away.  It never takes more than 1 round of negotiation to get the pricing you want.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Very knowledgeable and helpful salesman (MIke W.). One price policy for used BMWs with no haggle was appreciated. Fair pricing compared with other dealerships. I purchased a 2009 328i sedan with 55K miles. My first BMW.  I am very happy. I had a service issue that was handled with no problems. The 4,000 mile or 3 months free extended warranty on engine and drive train is appreciated.</Review>< time>

<text>Scam! Untrustworthy Service. Car was returned worse with additional problems! This place is 100% sales and zero customer loyalty. AVOID!!!!

-Reply to below:
I called and escalated to the service manager who was completely rude to me. the car was returned with the service light newly illuminated to which they blamed on a low battery; running now six months strong. Who pays $500 to get their car returned in worse condition? Why on earth would I call the general manager at this point when there's absolutely no trust at all. I'm done with you as should others be.< /text>< rating>

The service primarily due to my service advisor Braie Young was exceptional.  However while I was waiting I wanted to shop for a newer car.

I was set up with Larry Dodd the leasing manager to look at cars and go over my finances.   He showed me one car briefly and acted like I was wasting his time then I realized I hadn't looked in the back seat and asked if I could and he refused!

The sales manager Scott Clement said he would be working on it and to wait a few hours.  I was completely ignored until Braie came to check on me and had to find out what was going on.  Then Larry came over and told me to leave!  I told him I was waiting for Scott.

After awhile Larry came back again and said it was a no go.  I told him I wanted to talk to Scott and he reluctantly walked me me over to his office. I asked Scott a few questions and he said there was still some things he was checking on and he'd get back to me on Monday but he never did!

This has been the worst experience in trying to buy a car I have ever had!  I was treated like a low life by Larry and no one had the professional courtesy to follow up as promised!

I will not buy a vehicle here nor recommend this dealership to anyone!  I have a serious back injury and I was left for hours and they didn't even have the decency to follow up if it wasn't for Braie I would've been waiting there in pain longer!!!< /text>< Pics>

<name>Nate Cole<//name><date>1527121872948</date><rate>2<//rate><Text>TLDR: one dealer not interested and poorly informed.

I am shopping around for a well balanced city coupe or convertible and intend to make a well informed decision. This rating is based on an impromptu walk-in so it may be somewhat ill informed.

I parked my motorcycle and walked up to the building hoping to be greeted by a salesman. None to be identified. I walked inside and i had to walk up to a desk before I could get a bit of assistance. Even then it took one of them a moment to realize i was there.

I was helped by this gentleman (Larry) and, while he wasn't a jerk by any means, it seemed like he couldn't be bothered to show a little interest. I asked about the 230i and tried to get some information about the car but he did not give me even the smallest bit of useful information. He only gave me generic lines one would find in a commercial. He was cool enough to let me take a seat to check the roof height.

Here is a little of what he said when i asked about notable features on the car itself: "With BMW you get world class engineering, second to none." "The fit and finish is top notch." "You can't compare it to a japanese car."

Of course I can't compare it, the guy at toyota actually gave me a ton of useful info, including the history of the model I was looking at (the 86).

I may have been better off talking to someone in service.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I was pleased with the price if my vehicle, but when having it serviced, I was mortified to learn that a change if our and spark plugs would cost me a thousand dollars. A battery was five hundred. And whether strip was three hundred per window not including labor. I will not return to this place with any more business.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!!! Before I came to BMW of Vista, I was at another BMW Dealership looking at the new BMW M2. I had already test drove the M2 and M4 at this other dealership and then we sat down to do the numbers. I informed the sales rep (which was new) that I came from the Dealership background as well so "please let's not play the numbers game". He insured me that it won't be a problem. Sure enough when he came back from the finance department, we were sitting there playing games. I hopped on the phone with Paul from BMW of Vista, told him that if he could meet my needs and do what I was looking for because I was already sitting and doing numbers at another dealership but they were playing games and in 15mins he called and said "COME PICK UP YOUR CAR". I immediately left the other dealership and went over to BMW of Vista. It was EASY BREEZY, in and out under 30 mins. Now I have my new BMW M2, M Performance Package that is a limited edition even one step up from the other one I was looking at. Thanks Paul!!!!< /Review>

<text>I love the Mini however i’m not Impressed with the service after the sale. The sales rep Aaron no showed so i got ed as a back up. I was also pre approved so to get to finance took about 2 hrs and i was about to walk. Not to mention the Car came with only one key and Ed was like oops I forgot that.
This was my 1st time at a BMW dealer I will not recommend this particular dealer to my 500 Marines / employees or friends.

They did some maintenance work on my car a couple of times. They are a bit more expensive than indies for maintenance, and their repair work quote was much more expensive than independents. They will wash your car free of charge even if you just stop by for that.<//text>

<Text>Service Department Review:  theme is miss-communication and not following through.

Received a recall notice in the mail, it seemed serious as it referred to a potential fire that could spark and cause significant damage.  Called service department to drop off my car.  I talked was able to get an appt the next day (Friday) at 1pm, the rep mentioned that the repair would take 2-3 business days.  She also informed me that I would be able to have a loaner car without issue while the car was being repaired.

Arrive at 1pm.  At 1:15pm I was able to meet with Braie a service adviser. He was nice and seemed to listen to my feedback that I knew my car would have other potential repairs pop-up but that I would not be repairing anything other then the recall items for this visit.  I also talked to him about the communication I received about the 2-3 day quote on time for repair and that I would need a loaner car during that period especially since I was going out of town Fri night-Sun night. He said to be sure to let the loaner car manager know this when booking the car.

I was able to talk with the Loaner Vehicle Manager Miguel.  Miguel entered my info to set me up with a loaner vehicle.  I saw a notice on his desk that if the car was not returned by the next morning following the completion of repairs there would be a $99/day charge for the car.  I asked Miguel about this an explained that over the phone and in talking with Braie that the repair might take 2-3 days so I just wanted to be sure since I was going out of town for the weekend that there wouldn't be a chance that I would be charged additional fees for the loaner car.  Miguel stated that this recall repair would be quick, completed today (Friday), and the loaner would be due back Sat morning.  I tried to explain that this is different then what the first 2 people said but he stated "I'm the Loaner car manager, I think I know what I'm talking about" in a condescending tone.  I said "ok, well if that is the case is there any other option?"  He said that he could have a shuttle take me back home today and then pick me up at 7:30am on Monday to ensure I could get my car and make it to work.  Miguel said he would arrive at work at 6:45am Monday and asked me to call him to confirm the 7:30am pickup.  Sounded fine to me, the porter driver was ready quickly and took me home.  The porter driver was an excellent driver and was the most personable person I met at the dealership.  Luckily, even though the appointment was 15min late I was able to make my flight out of town for the weekend.

Monday morning at 7am I tried to call Miguel, no answer.  I then tried the main number, they asked who my service adviser was, I said Braie, they transferred me to him, he said the car wasn't ready, he said he'd look into the shuttle to get me, and then I assume I'd get a loaner and go to work.  10min later, no call back, so I call the main line again, transferred to Braie again, hung up on me.  Call back again and at this time I'm running out of time I tell the receptionist that I'll find my own way to work and check in later to see if the car will be done today (Monday).

Monday 8:57am, still never got a call back from Braie after he apparently hung up on me but did receive a vehicle report via email/text.  I reviewed the report, said "no" to additional items that I already said "no" to in our initial meeting.

Noon, no word from Braie so I emailed him to see if the car would be ready to pick up today.  1hr 25min later, he responded saying it was ready.
I called the main number to arrange for a shuttle pickup at 5pm from my work.  The person was nice and said sure we will be there at 5. As she almost hung up I asked her "don't you need my work address?"  She got and I thought all was good. 5:10, no pickup came. Called Miguel, he said he would fix it or get me himself. 10min later no call back, called main # again, took 2 tries, finally got picked up & got my car.

Overall: time wasted, frustration, stress, first time with bad experience at a BMW service center</Text>< pics>

I never write reviews but my experience at BMW of Vista with Braie is worth taking the time to write a review. I have been going to BMW of Vista since I got my BMW in 2017 after a bad experience at my home dealership in Encinitas. Braie has ALWAYS helped me and ALWAYS goes above and beyond to make sure my car is taken care of. I am so thankful for him!!</text>

I just had my first visit to BMW Vista, and had a excellent experience there. My wife and I were greeted warmly when we arrived, and all of the staff were very pleasant. I want to give a very special thank you to Bill Amodeo, who handled our case. Bill was super friendly, and very professional. Bill is the kind of guy who will do all he can for his clients, and We feel lucky to have found him. I needed my car in a rush, so Bill managed to fit it in days before the next available appointment, and when we picked up our BMW335xi, they even washed it! The showroom/office is big, and comfortable, the staff are great, the products and services they sell are top notch... I would recommend this business to anyone. They have won a cutomer for life!</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Besides the car, BMW gave me a wonderful experience. Especially when it came to financing. They didn't try to bulls**t me at all. Everyone there is very friendly of course, but the thing that I appreciated most is that they took time to go over the differences between the different kinds of BMW Series, different kinds of insurance and warranties, and they took time to explain every little detail about the interior and electronics of the car. They didn't try to push me to buy a car either, instead they introduced me to a new kind of experienced.  My sales-guy even explained to me the differences between packages and saved me from spending extra money on miscellaneous extras. By then end of the day, I drove away a new and proud BMW owner with a great APR.< /text>< pics>

<review>I am new to Carlsbad. CA from Torrance, CA with a 740i BMW and only 4 months on my remaining warranty in need of an oil change, filter and 21,500 mile inspection.    I walked over to Costco for some items and then back to dealership until oil change and inspection was completed.
I would like to thank Thelma very much and if it was not for Thelma I would not think to return for another oil change or perhaps needed repair in future.
Thelma is a wonderful service representative.  Only complaint I have is cost to update my 2015 map navigation is $375.00.   A bit much when I have no plans of leaving Southern California in near or distant future so why would i care about street address or nearest Walmart I will never want or need to go?
Thanks Thelma.< /review><Rating>5</Rating>< time>

< Review>
Let me be clear with this review...this is the WORST service shop I've ever visited.  The sales department was outstanding when I bought my 750 in 2015 but the service department is absolutely 180 degrees different and horrible as of recently. When I bought my last BMW CPO and it needed work under the warranty in the first year, the experience was pleasant. Last year, my vehicle needed more work so I took it back to where I bought it and that was a huge mistake. My service advisor, Rachel, was horrible and obviously inept at customer service.  When I brought in my car, she was pleasant.  I agree with her on a $150 diagnostic fee to be paid if the work needed wasn't covered by my extended warranty.  When the diagnostic was completed and the insurance company agreed to pay only a portion of the repairs that they suggested were needed, she called me to suggest that I pay more than $8k for repairs.  I declined and told them to just perform the $2k worth of repairs that the insurance company agreed to pay. She became irate that I wouldn't pay out of pocket and tried to charge me more than $500 in diagnostic fees whereas the agreement was $150 if the insurance didn't pay for the repairs.  I told her firmly that was outside of what we agreed upon or what the estimate we signed stated. I instructed her to just do what the insurance paid for and I'd come get my car for a second opinion then she hung up on me. When I came to get my car, she acted as though she hadn't just rudely hung up on a customer. As I pulled out of the parking lot, my check engine light came on. Not wanting to deal with this dishonest shop again, I took my car to my regular mechanic shop and they checked it out and told me to take it back to BMW of Vista for the issue was most likely caused by the other  mechanic' s shotty work when replacing my spark plugs and was now causing  a misfire.  No matter where you buy your BMW or how you view dealerships versus private shops, AVOID this dealership at all COST. They are hacks that attempt to overcharge and become combative and grossly unprofessional  if you don't acquiesce.  Save yourself the stress and money and go to a reputable, honest, and professional establishment not this one. If this app allowed zero stars, this review would be most accurate.

Follow up:  After this review, the owner responded for the sake of saving face here. He offers that his GM would attempt to rectify the matter. Well, I received a call from the service manager a few days later in February and he said that he'd look into the matter and get back yet it's the end of March and haven't heard back from the guy yet.   We can agree respectfully that the only thing worse than bad service is "lip service".

If you care about your car and money, take the time and see the pattern of the other poor reviews and there is an obvious pattern.  The sales' experience is deliberate but the service experience is horrendous and rather unscrupulous.

Again, normally I don't waste my time reviewing bad organizations but in this case I must warn others before they trust their prized vehicles with this shop when there are so many better options in North County that you can trust.<//Review>

I have never been to a dealership befotre. I always heard the horror stories and gave them creedance.  Vista BMW was none of what I was led to expect.

Mr. Bentley Demuth was a gentleman, most coutteous and helpful.  His k owlege of the BMW brand was exceptional and extensive.  He listened to what I wanted and NEVER tried to sell me on any vehicle not in my description.

The manager  extended wvery courtesy possible and assisted in cementing the vehicle I selected.

Finance never pressured me to buy any extras , they merely offered options for service emphasizing which would compliment my insurance coverage. His extensive knowledge of the services available enhanced the experience rather than being an ordeal of wrangling over prices.

I believed in the brand's quality before.  Now I see their staff lives up to the standard projected.</Text>

After looking on TrueCar and AutoTrader for 6 weeks to find the perfect CPO BMW X5; we contacted six different BMW dealers via email. BMW of Vista was the only one to actually have the model we wanted in stock, and they also answered our questions before we drove over. Aaron in Internet Sales was awesome! He helped us without any BS sales tactics or put downs which seems common among luxury brand sales people. He happily ran some alternate purchase scenarios, such as new versus our desired CPO so we could see the real numbers going forward. He has been great every step of the way- before, during and after the sale. I would highly recommend BMW of Vista in Southern California as your first stop for your BMW needs.</Text>

<Review>I went into the dealer knowing exactly what I wanted - a CPO BMW 328D. There was only one on the lot, and the sales rep, Paul, was super helpful. He showed me the dynamics and features of the car, and took me for a test drive. Within 30 minutes of arriving at the dealership, I was filling out finance paperwork for their very competitive in-house financing. We originally found the car using the USAA car buying service, which was a huge help. I didn't feel pressured to buy at any point, Paul and Kyle (in finance) answered all of my questions and were extremely patient with me as we went through process. My husband wasn't able to be present at the transaction due to working in LA - so, BMW of Vista had me sign my end of the paperwork at the dealer, and that evening they DELIVERED my 328d to our home in Temecula, and brought the rest of the paperwork for my husband to sign at home. What service! We then got the dealer delivery demo in our very own driveway. It was an awesome experience. I've had a few follow up questions post-sale, and I've texted Paul directly - he always answers quickly and gets me the information I need. It was an awesome experience. Thank you, BMW of Vista!< /Review>< response>

Nagy took good care and invested time and energy to ensure all questions were answered and provided good attention post sale with service as well. Followed up regularly via phone. Rating 4.5 /5.

Took the car for miscellaneous servicing twice, one was good, other was terrible. If it wasnt for my convincing the technician in the workshop about leaking air valve during the bucket dip test, the fault would have been overlooked and I would end up with flat tyre. I am 20/80 with the service experience. Rating 2/5.

Overall, BMW of vista can focus on improving their service team at this location.</review>< Pics>

My experience with the service writer Joe was an absolute nightmare. He was aggressive and confrontational actually yelling at me in his cubical to the point where another service writer called the manager to tell him how unprofessional he was treating me. I will never bring my car here for service or recommend anyone else bring their car there.< /review>

First of all I tried to set up the service appointments ntment online twice and the system does not allow for scheduling an appointment.  It says someone will get back to you and this never happened.

I had to call 4 times before I got to speak to someone about getting an appointment.  They took information about what I wanted done. When I arrived I had to go through what I wanted done again.

I expected to have a courtesy van take me back home and had indicated as such when I made the appointment.  The service advisor was not aware of this and I had to wait two hours for the service.

One of the things I asked to be done is an oil change.  This was not done so I will have to spend another 2 hours getting this done.< /text>

< review>
OVERVIEW
This isn't a review by someone who didn't get the deal they wanted or experienced "bad" sales customer service. I bought an $85,000 car from BMW and follows is a terrible account me being charged for a loaner car (during a service) that BMW had provided and then several months of broken promises to resolve the problem

_______________________________________________________________

5 Month update
BMW finally settled the issue. It ended up being a lot of extra work calling off the lawyer and the BBB but at least they did give me a refund - what a journey. The manager convinced me to give them another try for service. It ended up being an experience that wasn't horrible the second time around.

4 Month  Update
About 30 days ago I got a call from the general manager Mya Bradbury after I sent them an email outlining my troubles. He opened with "you have had one hell of an experience". Then like a knight in shining armor, he came in to save the day. Promising he would have this resolved and a payment out to me asap. I was relieved. Fast forward to today. No check, no return of phone calls or emails and when I finally got hold the sales manager, I was told I needed to take this up with the service director. I pleaded with Scott (the sales manager) explaining that Charles (the service director) and Mya (the general manager) already took responsibility of the issue and said would send me my $318, but have not fulfilled their promises. Why do I have to go back to square one? Please just do what you said you would do. He gave me another empty promise of a callback and put the phone down without taking my number. At this point, I have filed a complaint with the better business bureau. Let's see where it goes from here.

3-month update.
I've lost track of emails and phone calls at this point. Still dealing with this, like a ping pong ball between BMW and enterprise. BMW promised to send me a check 6 weeks ago to cover the cost of the rental. Still no check. When I called the service manager to discuss an update, he mysteriously decided that enterprise would refund me instead and decided not to send a check after all, all of course with no notification to me. Is anyone at BMW reading this? I bought an $85,000 car from BMW and this has been one of the worst run-around experiences I have ever been through.

Original review:
This would have been a 5-star review because BMW service is normally amazing. The reason it's getting a 1 star is that I took my X5 to this place for a service. Everything was normal, they gave me a loaner car while they were working on mine in June of 2017. I had to go to Enterprise because they didn't have a car for me. Enterprise took my credit card but I was assured that BMW would pay for it. Fast forward to October of 2017 and I see a charge for $318 on my credit card. Upon calling Enterprise I am told BMW hasn't paid its bills. Now I have to run around making several calls, waiting for callbacks and generally dealing with this headache to clear up this whole mess. Thanks alot BMW of Vista. My main worry now is that when dealers stop paying their bills it might be a sign of them going out of business......</review>

<Text>The front desk staff were amazing at keeping me up to date and were very friendly however, a few things were not up to par for a dealership charging top dollar. After a factory recall for airbags the steering column wasn't adjusting and a switch panel that was removed no longer worked. On return I was told the switch panel was faulty.... well it was ok before they touched it. I never asked for the airbags to be faulty. I ended up paying for the part ($237) but negotiated no labour. Tire pressures were apparently checked and set to factory settings, but they weren't. Battery was not secured back into the car! I did this when picking the car up since i had a socket set in the trunk. iDrive button was broken off and just sat back on. I questioned it and they said just glue it! Trunk no longer auto opened and they just couldn't fix it. It was returned not working, but it worked ok before they did the recall work. Whilst the car was in for the recall i was given a 4 series loaner. I need 7 seats as my X5 has 3rd row.... i was told they didn't have anything bigger because they are too expensive? Anyway I hate any dealers or workshops and do all work myself. On this occasion i couldn't do a factory recall job.< /Text><response>{'time': 1516352269995, 'text': 'Thank you very much for sharing these comments, Graeme.

<Text>I have the chance to be close to BMW of vista, so naturally I went there for servicing. This is my first BMW and to tell you the truth I was excepting the worst based on hearsays about the overall dealerships attitude. I was completely wrong. Bill was my representative and was very courteous and helpful. I had a little crack in one of my seat and they made sure to order the leather to replace it in a swift manner. They took very good care of my car and made sure that everything was thoroughly inspected. Overall it was a very easy and agreable experience and I definitely recommend BMW of vista. I do advise you to book your appointment early in the morning as they tend to get busy after that.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I needed to get my recall fixed, so I called and scheduled an appointment. I brought my car in, got into a rental, after no one offered to help me get all my stuff into the rental with my 8 month old, only to tell me "they just can't get the recall fixed and don't know when they will be able to." So instead I got my oil changed and backup camera fixed.  They didnt bother setting me up with another dealership that can fix the recall, they just tell me to figure it out. The recall has to do with the latch for the car seat for my baby. This isn't just something to figure out. Obviously if BMW had put a recall on it, it's a serious matter.
After coming back, to switch cars, they park my car in a lot, hand me the key and tell me to switch everything out. Again, no help, and they didn't even bother cleaning my car after they gave me a rental car that had 3 miles until empty and I filled the tank up to full for them.
Horrible experience.</Review>

<rating>2</rating><text>One morning I went to get 1 wheel lock off my tire and they were able to get me in and out and all I paid for was the lugnut to replace it! Great right? Next day I cruise in to replace all 3 of my wheel locks with normal lugnuts and figured I would have to pay for just the Nuts like i did the day before. NOPE. Wanted to charge me $75 in Labor to take off my wheel locks. I took my paid for lug nuts and left. I felt taken care of the first time around, the second time I got the stingy dealer experience.  If you’re cool with overpaying, go to bmw of vista!  Also, I was quoted $2200 for a 90k inspection, guys over at OMS cut that in half and gave me a much better experience. Go to OMS, screw the dealer unless you have a warranty!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1507557229963, 'text': "Thank you very much for sharing these comments, Michael.

This is my 5th BMW purchase over the past 10 years, but my first from BMW of Vista. I can't say enough great things about working with everyone during the purchase.  Aaron Passarelli, Darrin, and Kyle.  Truly a great team of people that have me excited for the next few years of ownership of my X5.  If you are considering your first BMW, or 10th BMW. I promise you. Call and ask for Aaron.</Text>

<Review>Was great in the beginning to deal with and stood with me during extended warranty issues, but when other 'issues' cropped up with the car, then the charges started to climb and mistakes started to get made. The experience left me not wanting to deal with this dealer again, much less BMW overall. I'm going to look for another brand. On the outside BMW's are great. When they work, they are a fantastic ride, but when something goes wrong and it's out of the warranty period, that experience becomes expensive and daunting. It's not so bad if it's a one or two time event, but when the same issues start cropping up, then that tells me that the design and engineering is bad. I don't like being a guinea pig for them and neither does my wallet. Bye BMW, it was fun, but this relationship is over.</Review><response>{'time': 1516842654094, 'text': "Hi Ayman, we appreciate you taking the time to respond.

<review>My car has been having quite a few problems lately (Sept.- Oct. 2016). Hopefully, it will be fine for a while now.
Some of the technical advisors at BMW do not seem to coordinate their work well. However, everyone is nice (except for one person who needs to work on his public relations: His tone of voice is not the best).
Last weekend I arrived at BMW in Vista and no one seemed to know why I was there even though I made an appt. the day before. But I was told that I was receiving a discount so I guess it "repaired" the error. I have been a very faithful customer for quite some time.  Much money spent.</review>< rate>

<text>My experience  with BMW Autonation Vista was very dealership typical. When you are in the process of scouting they will call and call and email everyday, yet when you purchase they will not call and follow up for any concerns you might have. My major problem is that during the paperwork the finance manager 'cash' as they call him was very persistant in over selling the add on's (maintnance and extended warranty) it was about 12am and I had my 8 year old son I regretfully signed on. I myself work in the sales industry but on a different platform I know businesses must upsell and thats why the next days when I wanted to re structure my contract nobody would contact me, when I finally walked in, it was such a drag with Cash and Kyle pretending to be professional about removing the extras. I had to return the next day on my own time and expense to finally remove the maintnance plan but I will never forget what Cash said "we only have 1 item left in the   contract and thats the extended warranty, cmon lets leave that in, we will give it to you for $1k less". This could not have been more disturbing and sad of what these people have to work with. I already gave BMW of Vista my business by buying their inventory at market value and further income by financing with them. I would rather take my chances on the vehicle and save those thousands that I signed for, for a possible future repair. This is why I say they are not in anyway a 5 star customer service establishment.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Courtesy Car wash a Joke. For being a premium dealer, their "free car wash" when you buy a new $60K car is nothing more than a gas station car wash that does the outside and blows it off. Mercedes Benz of Laguna Niguel does an immaculate job, which includes armoral on tires, for free! When I called to complain to sales Mgr, Scott told me he knows, but there is nothing he can do. For one, STOP telling people you give a free CAR WASH, and tell them you rinse the outside off. Might seem trivial, but a black car needs washed weekly, and if they are using it as a selling point, shame on them!!<//Review>

We were a bit late since we lived too far away and the salesperson called us to make sure our arrival time.

After we got there, we felt the same thing as the 1-star reviewer just right below my review. I walked in their showroom and told someone "have an appointment with XXX". Then i was kept waiting there forever......until I started to walk around and looked for him...Finally he came out with nothing explain, also no keys no  papers. The car we reserved to see still sat in the very inside corner of the parking lot. Not pulled out yet!  Another 20more min waiting, he found the key. My toddler got bored but there's only water offered in this dealership. No playroom no snack no drink nothing. I asked simple questions like what package the car has, but he always said he had no idea at all since he's a BMW salesman in a rude manner. He could've just showed a little courtesy and said he can try to find out for me. If you don't know what package your used car has, how can you price it correctly? That's a joke.

I finally sat down with him for i was going to buy a car. Until then, after a few times request and long waiting, i got carfax and some other papers to look at the table. He asked me to fill out a form to start finance process directly without asking me first. He was uncomfortably surprised when i told him we are cash buyer. However, he still insisted on filling out that form with my SSN and all important personal info, and told me it was the rule. I refused it. I bought cars in Lexus, Toyota dealership and other smaller dealerships before, all they need for cash buyer is driver license and insurance. I do have bad experiences like this asking for SSN and other vip info with a couple of dealerships before, and some of them even lied and threatened to me that's illegal to sell cars to cash buyer who doesn't provide SSN. However, all of them gave up that form after going back and forth about the issue in the end to continue business with me lol.Anyway, I still left those dealerships without buying anything every time including this time. I don't trust them anymore since i heard stories about selling personal info for xxx bucks.

I gave it 2 star because our reserved car was still there and i did test drive it mainly in the parking lot. I will never go to such a cold and thrifty dealership. They kept me waiting all the time and i spent 2.5hr there watching a funny show that our salesman always randomly disappeared for a long time.

Btw i ended up buying a used car in Escondido Toyota on the same day, where provide free 6 month/6k miles warranty. I was loving that used car in BMW so much and expected to buy it on that morning, but my mind was changed at the moment I stepped outside of the dealership for my cashiers check and never went back, no matter how good the deal is. Disrespect doesn't deserve my business. I think they don't care tho.

I guess for all the great reviews, they're buying BMW cars, new or used. I'm just 2nd class customer and don't recommend buying other brand used car here. Personally speaking, BMW is NOT a kids/family friendly brand, neither its cars, nor its dealership.</Text>< user_id>

<review>I've called twice now to speak to a service manager. First attempt there was supposedly no one available to talk to me.

Second attempt I talked to Eugene; my name, number and email was taken and I was told someone would get back to me. Days later and still no one has contacted me. I got the hint, I will go elsewhere.< /review>< gmapID>

<name>Ryan Collins<//name><Review>Don't bring your BMW here. Bimmers are too nice and to be worked on by these clowns.

I called and scheduled an appointment, but when I showed up the service team had no record of appointment and were rude about honoring it. I also asked for Cory, but the appointment scheduler apparently couldn't make this happen.

I was forced to deal with Brian. Brian was courteous when I picked up the vehicle, but it took a good 15-20 minutes before anyone helped me, and they gave me attitude about being busy. I do not care if you are busy, not my problem. I mentioned my vehicle had an issue with an item that BMW of Vista had repaired recently, he gave me the typical, "if it is covered, you'll pay the deductible, if not you'll be charged diagnostic, etc." I was fine with that. When I picked it up, they could not find the issue so I had to pay the $150 for them to do nothing. Brian said to call him if the issue came up again. Well less than 72 hours later the issue came up again. I have since left numerous messages for Brian, and despite being told I would receive a call back immediately, I have heard nothing from him. This is the level of service I have come to expect from BMW of Vista, unless I am dealing with Cory. I asked for Cory, but apparently the person making the appointment was incapable of fulfilling my request.

I was charged the $150 for diagnostic and for the technician to reset my window settings. This kept the error from occurring for less than 72 hours, and then the error was back. I should also mention this error occurred on a repair that was made by BMW of Vista within the past couple months. Unacceptable!

Lets move on to the wash, if you can call it that. There was a large, crusted on bird dropping on the rear of my car, if you are unable to remove something that noticeable, this leads me to seriously question your ability to work on my BMW. The vehicle had water spots all over, I could barely see out of my driver side mirror, and the doors looked horrible. BMW of Vista apparently makes a point to provide BUSH LEAGUE service and repairs, that is unacceptable for a BMW dealership.

Don't bring your BMW here. Bimmers are too nice and to be worked on by these clowns.<//Review></record>

I was experiencing a few issues with my vehicle's manual transmission (more specifically that it wouldn't go into second gear). I felt as though I was going to be stranded for the upcoming holidays. I called BMW of Vista promptly and spoke with Braie in service. Despite not having an appointment, Braie said bring the vehicle in ASAP, and although they might not get the chance to look at it right away, I would at least have a loaner car while my vehicle was in the shop. I dropped the car off, did all the paperwork and left within a half hour. A few days later, to my surprise, I get a call saying the vehicle is complete! It turns out my transmission had gone wrong and a few other things. A few things I wanted to note about my experience: The quality of work by technician Ray was top-notch. I'm one of "those" customers who is typically a complete nightmare to work with. I'm overly picky and very meticulous. All of the repairs are done at or better than the factory. Hands down. The communication between their service department any myself is second-to-none. I received status updates every step of the way. Both advisor Braie and service manager Vince come with my highest of recommendations. Thanks again for all of your hard work!< /Text>

Horrible I brought my car for sulev warranty and even doe it was under warranty they manage to charge me 250 plus they kept my car for olmost a moth without giving me a loaner. They replaced recalled airbags and broke my dash moldings thinking I wasn't gonna notice. After 10 day I called upset and the advisor told me he didn't like my tone so if I wanted I could go pick up my my vehicle that wasn't even ready not going back Encinitas dealer has better customer service!!<//text>

<Review>Car was dropped on September 28th, it was not completed by 30th and I was leaving for a week.  They requested I pick up as-is and return their loaner.
I would need to bring back after my vacation.  I dropped off the car on October 8 and it was completed on 19th.
Service department kept me updated on progress, however, having to bring in my car 2 times and having it be service for an extremely long time was not pleasant.  Having doubts about BMW product.</Review>< pics>

I want to express my thanks and appreciation for Don Eckert, Service Advisor. He has been our BNW service person for many years. He shows interest and understanding of any problems which have occurred to our 750i's.

I was very satisfied with Missy, the local owner. It is now an Autonations dealer. Hopefully they will respond to the "individual" as Mossy did. If not, I will seek out BMW if Escondido (formerly Brecht).<//text>

<text>Sadly the services and attention provided by the Lease Portfolio Manager, SCOTT CLEMENT and MIKE, Sales Manager, differs greatly from the previous services obtained by other staff.  For an entire month, after returning our leased 328i vehicle, I obtained low quality service.  We returned our vehicle one month early before the end of our lease period, when the vehicle was returned, Scott Clement assured me that we had no outstanding balance as the dealership was buying the car back from us. Because our family was moving out of state the following day, I requested a confirmation call - for security purposes.  He  agreed and promised to call me and confirm that everything was in good standing.  After not hearing from him for two weeks, I called to follow up.  I was fortunate to get him on the phone, at this point, he informed me that everything was okay; however, he learned that we would be responsible for paying the disposition fees.  We paid disposition fees as instructed - however, to our surprise, we soon learned that we were still being billed the additional monthly payment. In attempt to learn of the reasons for the charge I reached out to Mr. Clement. Five calls in total (2 week period):  3 voice messages directly to his voicemail and 2 with customer service, all messages included my contact information - Mr. Clement neglected to return any of my calls.  I finally decided to speak to someone else, I was directed to Mike (sales manger) - he apologized and secured that he would "look into it" and would get back to me the following day.  Two (2) days past - no word from the sales manager, called back and left him a phone message which he also neglected.  I finally asked my husband for his assistance after five (5) days.  At this point, Mike said he would have to 'look into it' once again.  This time he called back to tell my husband that the dealership could not be held responsible for the payment and stated that it is difficult whenever there is a "he said, she said" - What ever happened to their good customer service and taking responsibility for their own mistake?  Putting my words and honesty in question really is a reflection of poor customer service and the lack of integrity of the Sales and Lease Department.  I am sad to see the dealership's reputation vanish before my own eyes as a result of the negligence of two of their employees  - in management positions.  I have never done this, but I feel that this type of negligence and treatment should go directly to corporate - I will proceed by submitting this statement and complaint to corporate.< /text>< rate>

I always go to BMW Vista to get all my service done. They are very welcoming and respectful. My service advisor was Braie Young. He was very professional explained everything step by step for me. He kept contact with me throughout the whole time my car was being serviced he kept me updated with calls and voicemails. When I got back everything was done above expectations. The actually employee that worked on my vehicle named Mike Khayat came out and went over all the service and repair he performed on my vehicle. You can't find employees like that nowadays. I will be returning here in the future just for Braie and Mike thanks again guys!<//Review>

<Review>I bought a 328i here at BMW of Vista about a month ago, like a week before Thanksgiving of 2016.  Initially my brother and I were just stop by and see what they had to offer.  We had no intention to buy on that day.  We were talking to a couple of dealers in Orange County since they had good deals due to volume sale.  And so we were getting ready for Black Friday kind of deal the week after.

So one Saturday morning after a the exercise, we decided to check out BMW of Vista, ran into an very nice sale person Michael W.  He took us for a test drive and show us the feature of the car,etc...  After getting back to the dealer, he said let's go make a deal.  So we were just well we're already here and let's see what they offer.

The first offer were pretty nice but since we were already talking to other dealers we knew and had a specific number in mind and made the offer with ~ 21% off the MSRP and they said OK.  We were very surprised and agree to the deal.  It is the best deal I ever had.

Since we weren't ready so I had to call my wife to bring the $ and paper work to buy the care.  Through out the whole process Michael never pressure us to buy and he was very nice, calm and reasonable.  We made jokes and had good laugh, etc...  It is one of the best car buying experience I had.

Then a week later, my brother in-law saw the car and he asked.  I told him how much we paid for and he said, what.... are you kidding?  He could not believe it.  Next week his car broke down and he is looking for a new car.  He went and did test drive for Lexus, Audi.... Eventually he ask to see if he can test drive our car since he did not want to stop by the dealer just to save some time.  He did and liked it a lot.  He asked me to call the same sale person Michael W.  and wanted the same deal.

So I called Michael W. back and told him about it.  The only thing is he wanted a different color.  Michael W. spent a few days searching for the car.  We went back and forth a couple times since BMW of Vista had a similar car but a bit different and cost more.  Eventually, he found one but it was at a different dealer.  About three weeks after I bought my car, we agreed on the second deal and so Michael asked to call my brother to give him a credit card for the deposit so he can transfer the car to his dealer.  My brother immediately called Michael back and wait.  Fifteen minutes later Michael called back and said the car was no longer available from the other deal but he said he will sell my brother the other car that we talked about earlier in the week but did not went thru due to higher price with more discount.  I could not believe it.  The dealer wanted to keep their word and honor the deal.  They were kept their promise.
So the deal that my brother got was even better.  It is 22% off the MSRP.
He was so happy.  The next day he took the car to work and texted me to thank me for the deal.  I told him enjoy the car.

I don't know when I buy another BMW but the next time I am buying another BMW, I will definitely go the BMW of Vista.  I would buy from them again.

Well, Google says they're open on Easter Sunday. My wife & I want to do a test drive a specific vehicle before purchasing. I've called & selected every branch from services to human resources. The sales line just keeps brining me back to the main menu & that's why I've tried every line just to see if anybody was there. All the other lines went straight to there voice mail.  Kinda ridiculous?!? Called the dealership in Encinitas. Well what do you know!!! Someone answered & they have the vehicle we want to test drive.< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>The review below on the service department being lazy and trying to “hard sell” the customers on easy but expensive work is spot on. I used to be in the car business and I know when someone is blowing smoke. BMW Vista (service adviser = BILL AMODEO) tried to charge me $3,253.00 for a repair that ended up costing me only $100 at an independent shop.

The cliff notes are that when I took my car in for a check engine light, the dealer simply ran the code and then seemed to say: “What can we justify charging?” Instead of taking time to diagnose the issue (which is why I thought I was paying $150 in the first place...for a REAL diagnosis), scumbag Bill Amodeo obviously was just trying to hit his service sales numbers and quoted me $3,253.00 for plugs/coils/injectors. That’s a lot of money for a very easy job and it turned out it wasn’t even the problem.

I ended up getting a second opinion from an independent shop. Turns out the coils/plugs/injectors weren’t even the issue. It was an O2 sensor and the diverter valves. A $330 repair that my aftermarket warranty covered costing me only $100 out of pocket (my deductible).

But it wasn’t just the quote that irritated me. Bill Amodeo and his manager Vince went out of their way to try to screw me. You see, when Bill first told me the quote I knew he was full of it because I already had an idea what was wrong. I told him that there was no way I would pay for that repair and I also didn’t want him to submit that quote to the aftermarket warranty company because they wouldn’t cover all new injectors/plugs/coils when only one was bad. It would be a waste of time and I was on good terms with my warranty company. I didn’t want to soak them for a big repair and have them less likely to cover me in the future. Bill PROMISED ME on the phone he would revise the repair and send it to the warranty company for authorization. He never called me back and simply submitted the full quote to my warranty company.

Bill called me two days later and told me the warranty denied the repair. This surprised me because I had never had a claim denied before. I then asked him what he submitted and HE STUTTERED AND DANCED AROUND THE QUESTION. I asked him again directly and he told me that he submitted exactly what I told him not to submit. He completely ignored my request.

Bill then tried to SELL me on the repair. It’s ridiculous. A desperate attempt to bill a customer an outrageous amount for a repair that wouldn’t have even solved the problem.

After I picked up the car, the service manager VINCE calls me and feeds me a gigantic line of horse manure that only car dealers can come up with. He accuses me of being dishonest about the warranty claim. Me? Dishonest? You are the one who tried to bill a $3,200 repair to both me AND my warranty company when the real problem ended up only costing me $100. You tried to screw me and my warranty company out of $3,200 and I’m dishonest?

I’m absolutely disgusted with the slimeballs at BMW Vista. Both Bill Amodeo and Vince are huge pieces of ish and I will be writing to BMW North America about this.<//text>< pics>

My CPO 335i (I bought elsewhere) has a warranty and service plan and the service department has been really helpful.  They troubleshot and fixed a BT issue and even matched discount tires pricing when I needed the two rear runflats replaced.  They've done service on a few other items and never gave me a hard time about doing warranty repairs.  They've tried to sell me on services I can easily do myself (coolant flush and injector cleaning at 30k miles), but no big deal.  They do a basic detail for free every time I'm in!  Really easy to work with and I've always gotten a loaner when I needed one.  I agree that krasavica1985's review was definitely for Vista BMW in FL, which has really bad reviews.</Text>< user>

This dealership does not take CPO certification seriously.  The vehicle sold to me was not fit to be certified and had numerous issues that I needed to resolve out of pocket after purchase.   My advice to anyone attempting to use this dealer for a preowned car is to stay clear, or have the car inspected by another dealership.  They do have a fine selection of vehicles, but be sure to have them inspected carefully. I had to have all four brakes replaced, all four rims repaired, and all four tires replaced due to damage that I was not aware of when I purchased the vehicle from them. Getting them to do anything about it required Customer Relations intervention, and even then I had to have the work done again at my own expense by someone else because it was not done correctly.  BMW of Vista made this purchase my very last BMW ever, and three months later I am now the owner of a wonderful Mercedes that I had to pay dearly for as several issues were still not resolved properly with the car.  I hope Vista can get its act together.</Review>

Only demerit is because I declined the $995 'CilaJet' paint/fabric protection upsell, but it nevertheless ended up in the monthly payment estimate sheets they gave me (which I didn't catch because I was only comparing payments by loan term and down payment at that point,) and then in the final sales contract.

Took a little bit of insistence, but I finally got it removed from the contract before I laid down that last signature.</Review>< pics>

<review>I was helped by Jesse - Sales and Sal - Finance. Both were absolutely fantastic! They talked with me to make sure that I was happy with what I was buying and that the price was comfortable for me. They even stayed late that day to make sure all my questions were answered. I highly recommend this dealership. I'm so happy with my Beamer! 🚙< /review>< Pics>
