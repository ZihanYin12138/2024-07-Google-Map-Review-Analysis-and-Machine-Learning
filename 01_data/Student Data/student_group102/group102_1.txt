I haven't been to Juice It Up! until 2 two weeks ago I tried their juices and they're delicious! The first juice I tried was Mighty-C Immunity Juice, 2nd was The Supercharger three days ago and the first smoothie was Superfruit Sunrise today. I'm in love with Juice It Up! and their drinks. It's the best juice bar I ever went.</Text>

<Text>We went in and bought 3 smoothies and 2  Açai bowls. It cost $33 for all 5. The Açaí bowls were made wrong. They were supposed to be strawberry and banana and we got strawberries and blueberries. The mango smoothie tasted like ice and powder. No flavor at all. The strawberry wave one was just as bad. Where was the flavor. I don’t know if it was the person that made them or if they changed their  recipe. But something wasn’t right. Waste of $33.< /Text>< userid>

< Review>
This was without question the worst acai bowl I have ever had. Watery, full of chunks of ice. I am not sure there was any acai in the bowl. It was the consistency of soup, and the toppings sank to the bottom. Flavor was bland at best. Will never go back. Absolutely terrible bowl.<//Review>

<review>I come to this one all the time!! Never had a problem until today! The two dark haired Asian girls working today. 3/24 at 11:20 am. I asked them what happened to the paper cups cause I know their sizes are different then the plastic cups. They said they switched them all to the plastic and I said ok so is it the same sizes as the plastic now? And they said well they have a few left of paper cups. And I POINTED to the plastic cup on display and said I want this in an ever green. They gave me this big gigantic cup in the paper cup! I wanted a smaller size! That's why I asked what I asked and that's why I pointed to the cup!!! Hello!!! So I told them I didn't want that I wanted a smaller size. So they pour it in the displayed cup I asked for l. Still too big.. so I ask them is this the size on the display they just looked at me... then continued to talk to each other... and I said hello? Yes or no? Rude!!!!!!! this is why I asked what happened to the paper cups cause I get the same drink everyday and it comes in the paper cup and it's the perfect size for me. So I said no I need smaller still and they go well you paid for a large and I said whatever I don't care I just can't drink all of this. So they pour it into a smaller cup smaller then what I usually get... I gave up. I took my drink. Told them to keep the extra money I paid for the gigantic drink as a tip which they DID NOT DESERVE! And left... I'm gonna be contacting their manager... the girl that usually works her name is chelsea and she is great!! She gets 5 stars but since this happened I will no longer be coming to this location. These two immature little girls ruined my experience today...< /review><user_id>110591904600323540680<//user_id><Name>Chelsea North< /Name><Pics>None<//Pics><gmapID>0x80dd2ea817b53371:0xbccabed407b8d39a</gmapID>< Rate>

All I wanted was Juice It Up for breakfast as I wasn't feeling well...online it says opens at 730...I got there, the sign in window says 745 so I waited...at 755 they still weren't open...needless to stay my morning didn't start off well. Couldn't wait any longer or I'd be late for work 😡</text>

< Review>
I come here for the wheatgrass and the last 3 times I've been in, they don't have any. Their machine is even put away..I guess they aren't selling it anymore??.. the juice it up off of katella still sells it so I've been driving farther everyday to get it.<//Review>

<text>Needed a simple tail lightbulb.  Walked in without a mask on (like a sane, rational-thinking person) and I was NOT greeted as a customer in any way, I was immediately called out for not having a mask on.  After leaving and returning with a badge of submission on my face, suddenly I WAS greeted like a customer (hello! Welcome to O'Reilly!  Like it was impossible to address me like a customer before insisting I put a mask on) THEN they sold me the wrong bulb.  Swing and a miss, kids.  Fail.  I ONLY gave them 2 stars, because they were open during their posted business hours.  Buy your auto parts ANYWHERE besides here.  Tools....

The people who worked there in the past were very helpful and knowledgeable.   Now  it seems like the employees don't know anything.   My battery was dead tonight.   I got a jump and called to see if they would replace the battery for me after I bought it.  I was told no due to covid.  Really??  Replacing a battery requires zero contact!

Rudy was extremely rude and unprofessional. I have filed a complaint because he lacked training in customer service. I hope management and the leaders at O’Reilly Auto Part are able to weed out people who lack customer service skills to work at a business as this.  He denied a request of a battery that was purchased at this location with a 3 year warranty and claims that the customer information was not on file. Total waist of time and energy.
Nicholas Perez y’all lost a valued customer and need to update customer service training at store 2869.<//Review>

This store over-charged me for a steering wheel cover.  So first time and last  time in this store for me.   It seemed expensive when I paid for it, and after checking prices online, I see that they charged me a top dollar price.  That's what car dealerships do; Auto parts stores are supposed to have lower prices.</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>Snow trip weekend ruined for lack of attention. We were given the wrong tire chains by Bryana. When we returned the same day to exchange the chains for the correct equipment so we can attempt to return the next day we were told that there is nothing they can do for us and to try and sell the chains on let go!!! I was so upset we ended up cancelling our cabin because I was not about to spend another $150 on another set of chains. It was a complete waste of time money and energy.< /Text>< UserId.>

The manager didn't know what he was doing. I was trying to buy something from the add witch was oil and filter for $33.99 dollars and it said 4 dollars to upgrade to a better filter. Well he was charging me 100 dollars more. He even got mad when I told him and he could do it on the computer.</Text>

Didn't have wiper blades for a prius.  Girl behind counter tried to give me another set and attempt to fit it on my car when it was pretty clear it didn't fit.  She then proceeded to tell me she needs to order it and it would cost $50... Also, wasn't given any options for wiper blade brands/cost.  She just brought out a set and charged me $40 which isn't a big deal but I would have liked to have been told the cost upfront or been given options.  Overall it was an ok experience and I got a refund. Employee was trying to help and it was a pleasant experience. Just needs to be cleaned up a little with offering options, notifying customers upfront about costs, and a little better product knowledge.  Their systems should have clearly shown whether they had wiper blades in stock that would fit.< /review>

Awesome service! I needed windshoeld wipers and it was raining. The sales associate installed my wipers. I was so grateful I tipped him 5bucks. It's great to help people like that. I miss my dsd because he was my mechanic but he died last year so, getting help with this stuff is foriegn to me. It was a big help.<//Review>

<Review>No customer service skills, waited for about 10 minutes just to get to the cash register and only 4 people in the store. Worst place that I came across in a long while.  The  guy never said anything, like I be with you or sorry for the wait. I won't be going back to the Anaheim at State College and La Palma store. No stars from me!!!!!</Review>< Pics>

The manager's name is Uziel.  He has no customer service or people skills whatsoever. Beware when you buy the lifetime warranty brakes because they'll will do whatever they can to void the warranty when you try and exchange them. He wasn't even willing to give me a pro-rate or a portion of the warranty. He basically said no, your warranty is void and walked away. No apologies or even a "I wish I could but I can't". I've been buying parts here for years and had no problem exchanging my brake pads once before on my other car. On the other hand one the other employees was helpful. His name was John.  But that doesn't make up for the manager not understanding customer service. I may now take my business elsewhere.<//Text>

<time>1489953328332< /time><Rate>4</Rate><review>Pretty OK BBQ....

The food was good, but as a first time patron, I was not made to feel welcomed.

This is a counter order, and they bring it to your table, kind of places.  The menu board was a bit confusing, and I wanted what I want, and it seemed as though I was bothering the counter guy with questions.

As I said, the food was pretty good BBQ, a bit pricey, but fair for the portion size.

The restaurant is located in a cute section of town, with a lot of little stores. Perfect for an after dinner walk

Give it a try.<//review>< pics>

Yes it is a little overpriced but you are getting what you paying for.... besides there are always specials for people on a budget. Ribs are good and burgers as well. Decorations is nice and the patio is a killer.... loved and enjoyed eating here. The wait was a little too much but other than that everything was good.< /text>

<user_name>james .hatten</user_name><review>I got take out, In my humble opinion the ribs were very good, hot sausage sandwich was also very tasty, but I have to tell you, the corn bread that came with dinner was excellent, it had. real kernels of corn,I have never had it like that, very good! I will be back here many more times, the good lord willing.< /review><UserId.>109870445562872588398<//UserId.>< GmapID>

< Review>
Most barbeque places are expensive anymore and I'm not entirely sure why.  Expect to pay about $20 per person but the food is pretty decent and very generous portions.  I'm a big guy but can easily split a platter with my wife.  The pork ribs are nice and the corn bread.< /Review>

<Review>The food is always lukewarm or cold, like it was stuck in the microwave twenty minutes ago. My feeling is they are pre-cooking in the morning and reheating throughout the day for their catering. Last time I went I ordered a burger as I thought it would at least be freshly cooked and it was disgusting. I took maybe three bites and couldn't eat anymore it didn't even have the texture of color of ground beef. All of my experiences there I have left disappointed but after my last one I left borderline disgusted.<//Review>< resp>

Overpriced that's for sure. And don't expect to get their prime rib ever. They claim Friday and Saturday nights but I went there two Friday's in a row to get it and they didn't have it. Oh and it was Friday at 5:10pm or earlier so it's not like it was super late. I called in advance and they told me they start at 430 for the prime rib. Any who, was forced to get the tri tip both times which was dry and mediocre. Grill better tri tip myself. Not recommended if you ask me, go to Raleys down the street and grill your own meat for much less.< /text>

Food was overpriced for the quality.  Sides were good and garden area was nice, but the ribs and chicken were served long after coming out of the smoker.< /Text>

The food was fine, it just wasnt anything special. Ludy's has such high standing in Woodland and so the locals put a lot of hype on Ludy's, which it really didnt live up to.</Review>

<review>I had originally planned on having the four tires on my vehicle to be replaced at my local Costco Tire Center in Antioch, but unfortunately that deal went south quite quickly.
So I decided to try America's Tire in Brentwood to see if they could try to match Costco's invoice price that was quoted, they didn't just match them they beat their price. The same tires and service.  The Customer Service at this facility was outstanding,  the quality and selection of products was impressive.  I have found a better place in the future to shop for my Tire replacement.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808ff8940f4907c3:0x8087f030cb0bf5e6<//GmapID></record>

Since closing the Antioch store, it took me awhile to go ahead and try the Brentwood location. Glad I did. I'm completely impressed! Super fast and honest. Friendly and knowledgeable employees with great customer service.  Bring your cell phone with QR scanner for even faster check in! 😊< /Text>

Great service from Alex and Mark. I have past experience buying tires here as well and they were always great. Go here instead of Big O Tires which are crooked and always causes damage to my car and for some reason gives 400.estimates to fix each time something different but always around 400.So go to America's Tire instead.They seem more honest,and reasonable in prices and fixed my tire with a nail for free even though tire was not from them. Good place.< /Review>

Very thorough and knowledgeable staff. The wait wasn't long at all for a walk in. They hooked me up with some really nice continental extreme contact DWS6 tires for my Camaro & balanced/mounted them beautifully on my new wheels. Thanks again</review>

<text>I purchased a set of tires from this location and I was very pleased. They changed my 4 tires and swapped out my old spare tire for one of the better tires that I was having replaced on my truck quickly. The staff was courteous and friendly. I will definitely be returning in the future for my tire needs 👍🏽< /text>< userid>

The customer service is amazing here. They are truly honest people and give their professional and personal opinions on their products and services. They saved me a ton of money and have a great price promise guarantee. They took two nails out of my tire that the dealership said was irreparable. The dealership wanted me to buy new tires, but after taking it to America's Tire, they found that they both were merely within the tread of the tire and easily pulled out with no complications. Mercedes sent me on my way with 2 nails in my tread to continue to drive on them, getting deeper and deeper, while America's Tire took them out with no issues.. AND this service to repair is FREE. And they did a complimentary inspection on the rest of my tires and sent me on my way. I'm back, 2 weeks later due to sidewall damage to purchase a set with them... never again at the dealership. They truly are AMERICA'S BEST TIRE SHOP ♡ thanks again to such a great team of people. Excited for my new set tomorrow once they get the order in.< /Review>

The service of the actual install and work was great, however I ended up waiting 2 hours simply because someone forgot to call me when my vehicle was completed!! I called the store once it hit the 2 hour mark and some guy said "oh yeah, your cars been done for a while now" yet I never received a call... Such a waste of time. Not returning to this store.<//review>

<Review>Avoid this place. Even though they have lower prices, their customer service is severely lacking. So much so, I will happily pay a higher cost to get better customer service. Sadly, like others, over the years I have remained a loyal customer of this location by purchasing multiple sets of tires for the multiple vehicles I own (4). I will not be returning.  When I want my tires rotated, as offered as a free service, they should rotate my tires. They SHOULD NOT give me a policy section why they can't do it or claim it's a concern for my safety. I am the customer! Just provide the service. But at this location they will not. They deny the service to pressure you into buying new tires.  I will eventually be purchasing new tires soon but not from Americas Tire. Plus, this isn't the first time I've had an issue with the customer service at this location but, in good faith, I gave them a second, and a third chance.</Review>< rate>

<user_name>Brandon<//user_name><review>Came here to get tires unmounted and tires mounted on a new wheel but damaged both wheels while demounting.
One of my new tires is leaking so i went back to the store that installed and said i have a pinhole on the beadseal.
They claimed they have nothing to do with it and can't do anything about the tire.
Most likely ripped a beadseal off that spot and using the pinhole as a excuse.
Everytime i come here something gets damaged and scratched even when you used the best employee.Says alot about this store.</review><date>1556753737334< /date><rate>1</rate><Gmap_id>0x808ff8940f4907c3:0x8087f030cb0bf5e6</Gmap_id>< Pics>

<Review>2 sets of tires at American,  my Goodyear tire developed a bubble on the sidewall at 5000 miles.  They wouldn't even cover a manufacturer defect.  Goodyear will reimburse AT but they charged me 80.00 for the replacement tire.This is the only tire store that sells insurance so you're not saving any money.  I'll never go back.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>**1st timer** Made an appointment to install new tires on my Mom's car. Dropped it off with a 1 hour "promised by time" and went for a pizza over at MOD. Came back and found out that they only had 3 of the 4 tires they promised me, so they installed the next best tire (extra 10,000 mile treadwear warranty) at no extra charge, and it was ready to go. Excellent service!
(*edit*) forgot to mention that they extended their "cyber Monday" offer to me, and a technician helped me fill it out during delivery. 5-1/2 stars ✨ 8f I could. 👍< /Review>< Pics>

Same company.  I've been a customer since 2016. Looking for great service with quality work, come to America's Tire!!!<//Text>

I stopped by here in a pinch yesterday as I felt one of my wheels was imbalanced after rotating them in the morning. I pulled the wheel off and asked them to balance it really quickly as I was out and about with my kids and have a lot of driving planned for the weekend. They did this for me quickly and painlessly and I had my wheel back on and was back on the road in like 10 mins. They were booked the rest of the day but took a few short minutes to take care of me and didn't even bother to ask if I'd bought my tires from them (which I did). Above and beyond customer service right there, something that's hard to find these days. Thanks guys!<//Review>

< Review>
Purchased many tires from the Brentwood location. In the past, they have been great, not so much today. I waited 3 hours for them to even take a look at my flat tire, to tell me they couldn't repair it. You are more interested in sales, than in customer service. Free rotations and service mean nothing. Flats happen and there should be a dedicated employee to address these immediately. An appmt was not possible. Very disappointed. Would not recommend purchasing tires from this location.< /Review>

While they worked on my car, they gently woke me to tell me my car was all ready. They went over everything they did, & if I understood & if I had any ?'s. Thank you for such great service guys 😘< /review>

Usually a wait but they price match and usually will give you a discount on something. And the $80 insurance has come in handy a few times when I've gotten flats. They will either repair or replace the tire.</Review>

<Review>Very disappointed this time.

Fortunately I was not in a bind to get a slow leak fixed so the only thing wasted was my time. I knew(and was told) I would have to wait because I didn’t have an appointment, and the next available appointment was three days from now. That doesn’t work for me. I waited as long as I could, and other customers with flat repairs came and left due to the wait time while I waited. In short, if I can’t get a random leaky tire repaired in less than two hours and have to go somewhere else to get it done, I’ll likely buy my next set of tires there too.<//Review><Response>None</Response>< pictures>

Good prices. Fair. Friendly service. I usually make appointment but today add to tires that we're losing air. Turns out two of my tires need replacing and I and projected a 90-minute way. Not bad.<//review>

<Review>Came here twice. First time was about a month ago, I came for a flat tire repair and boy was I shocked when I was told there was no cost for the repair. I told the folks here that I didn't buy the tires from them and they said it doesn't matter.  In the process of fixing one of my tires, they discovered another tire had a nail and went ahead and fixed it too (at no cost).  Last week, I wanted to replace my tire before my road trip and of course I came here. The guy took a look at my tires and was very honest in suggesting just to replace the rear ones as the front ones still got good life on them. Had both my rear tires replaced and out of there in about 30 minutes.  Prices here are very competitive (I think they were about $0.05 cents more) excellent service and professionalism by everyone here, I will be a repeat customer.< /Review>< UserId.>

There were 2 men in front of me At 8:00 am sharp, the door was opened and 5 service agents greeted each customer. It was so refreshing to receive smiling and welcoming faces!
I had the pleasure of seeing Zach. He asked how he could help me; I asked if I could get a tire rotation. I was waiting to hear that I needed an appointment or that I would have to come back later in the day.
Zach said I will get you right in and asked for my car keys! He invited me to sit inside while he pulled my car to the shop.
I saw several agents speaking with customers. Each was kind, respectful and focused on all their customers.
Within 20 minutes Ryan called my name and approached me saying my car was ready!
Ryan drove my car out and with a great smile said have a great day.
I was home in 10 minutes. My entire journey from home to America' s Tires was less than an hour.
I highly recommend this establishment for their outstanding customer service. I felt respected as a customer and confident that my tire rotation was completed properly and safely.
I will return after 4000 miles to this Brentwood location.<//Review></record>

I purchased the warranty on my tires through them, which I HIGHLY recommend, and needed to have a replacement. The tire was completely covered and only paid $8 for coverage on the new one. Exceptional service from the representative zack. He was quick with the process and polite. Would recommend an appt at this location for they do get busy but are quick.< /text>

<text>Not really sure what another reviewer said about a "hustle". I bought two good quality tires, they were mounted and balanced and ready to go in an HOUR and for a great price. I was pretty impressed with the free repair they did a few days later when one of my two old tires started to go flat.
The guys here are always professional, friendly and personable. They're very helpful with any and all questions and concerns. I won't be going anywhere else for tires. Excellent customer service is very hard to come by these days.<//text>< pics>

The customer service is top notch.  I recently visited for a tire rotation.  After it was finished, honestly a few days later, I noticed my center cap to my run was missing on my back driver side rim.  I called them and they never once questioned the circumstances.  They immediately ordered a replacement cap and called next day to let me know it was already in.  I arrived and they had me out of there within 5 minutes with a new free center cap.  Never questioned my claim and just did the right thing.  I am now a forever customer.< /text>

Don't waste your time calling around for the best tire prices. America's tire is the best when it comes to price, quality, and customer service. Thank you very much!< /Review>

American tires is very costly and a quote for 2 fires was 45 dollars each but came out to a total of 140. I might as well buy the tires myself and put them on there. They also do not know any good places to get your car serviced. They gave me a number for a guy who can fix transmissions but he was so rude I had to hang up. Also the wait is very long, but at least the workers are nice and respectful<//Text>

Any other place I've stopped by and requested this to be done and you're made to feel like, "Serious? We're busy selling tires here. Let me see if I can find somebody to do this".
At America's Tires its being told to pull my truck up to the first bay and there is usually somebody on it in less than a minute. All very polite and friendly employees.< /Text>< pics>

huge scratch on my fender from changing the tire, lied about it, they sent me $500 for an $1100 repair, its not the money its the lying, don't trust them, will never return and suggest if you have a nice car don't take it there, they can damage it and just lie about it and you are stuck with the repair. also the tires are very noisy, need to take my car to another place to have them rotated , never ever again..... dishonest, the workers and the manager and the corporate office<//Text>

Good service, but I had to wait 2 hrs. Time is precious to me. This chain has a location in Antioch as well,  close to Somersville and had never taken me more than 30 min. I recommend it, if you are not willing to wait 2 hrs in the Brentwood one.< /Review>

Great service and an outstanding price.  Went first to Big O and then to America's Tire.  America's Tire, for 4 tires, was $151. less.  The tire quote was for the same tire (BF Goodrich 255 R16 99W).</text>

Ok, got new tires and rims on Craigslist for my truck and they needed balance so I went to a competitor since he was able to do this on a Sunday and he even gave me a discount. Instead of $40 he charged $35.  But when asked about the sensors in the rim, he explained that they wouldn't work with out pulling mine out of the original wheels.  I was reluctant to do the time sake and monies.   Two days later I went and saw Lorenzo at America's Tire Company and he programed the sensors on the new wheels to my truck and we didn't have to pull the old ones from my original wheels - and no charge....</Review>

Lorenzo is a turd. He chastises people and thinks they know nothing about cars and/or wheels and tires. He has no respect for others. Retraining is probably going to do nothing. You can't fix people like that. Hope they fire him for his lack of decency in customer service.</Review>

I wanted to make sure you all here about a great experience as it seems most internet reviews seem to be negative.
I have been a regular customer for many years and have always had a very fair price and great service with all of the America’s Tire branches. I am a sales rep so I drive about 30,000 miles a year so every 2-3 years I’m back spending my hard earned dollars here. I moved to Antioch, CA in late 2009 and found the Americas tire closest to me was this one in Brentwood. I have always been taken care of whether it is a new set of tires, a rotation, or a flat repair. This store has a great staff that get me in and out as quickly as possible. Yes, this store is BUSY and I am a patient man.
I wanted to send out a special note and thanks to SEAN TRADER, the assistant manager. He is  very knowledgeable and suggests the best new tires for me. I was disappointed with my last tire purchase of Continental’s that only lasted 47,000 miles with a 90,000 mile warranty. Of course, Sean applied the proper pro-rating and suggested the newest from Michelin. He really knows was to suggest when I ask for things like “quiet ride” and “long mileage”. I feel confident with his suggestion.
The independent Consumer magazine test I read said the Continentals were #2. The Michelin Defenders were #1. I did not care for the noise from the harder compound. That’s why I chose the Continentals. When Sean told me the details of the new Michelin HR’s I was sold. These have an 80,000 mile rating so I’ll see you again before that. Hopefully, at or beyond that.< /text>

This is a very reliable and professional business.  They have been around for more than 2 decades giving quality service.  I recently went to 3 different places to have a key copied to no avail.  Then I remembered Safe and Secure. First try perfect match.

<review>Honest.  Professional. Expertise.  We had two key fobs that needed to be cut and programmed.  They did all work on both keys in about 20 minutes.  They have the cutter and the computer needed for this type of work.

They even have key fobs available for purchase if you don’t want to buy from Amazon or somewhere else.

I’m recommend this business and am happy we went there for our new Buick key fobs.

Thank you for running an honest shop!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Text>Dale and Terri and Andy = Amazing.  So professional.  They worked with my busy schedule.  Terri is a fantastic liaison, always asking the best follow-up questions and verifying information.  Andy expertly installed my locks.  The door handle needed some type of jigsaw reconfiguration, and he made it happen, saving me additional $100 on a handle.  Hence, the lock sufficed. And, when I did not have batteries for my digital lock, he said, "Don't worry about it; I have some in the truck."  Thank you so much Dale and Terry and Andy.  You are in my digital rolodex forever.  Yours sincerely, Dorothy.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

I called for a quote to replace a lock on a filing cabinet. Dale was very helpful at first but after asking for a written quote and clarification on a few other things (required by the company I work for) he responded as if it was too much work for him. I asked if it was too much work I could call someone else, and he rudely hung up on me. Horrible customer service. I do not recommend this company.< /Text>

I called from Corona and asked if they were Medeco Authorized and they said yes and asked me several questions about the key shape and imprint, asked about the code card which I had! And I passed the quiz and he said he could make the keys, so I drove down arrived at 4:45 walked in a young man asked what I needed handed him the keys and he couldn't find the blank so he asked another guy who said you're not gonna find that on our board. He turned to me and said he couldn't copy, so I told him I called and passed the test and was told they could, he then said that must have been Dale and went around the corner and Dale came out and said ya I can copy it but not in 8 mins and that the boss doesn't pay overtime so I'd have to come back. I asked what time they opened he said 8 and I said  if I came at 9 would that be enough time? He said yes.  I got called to work early and wasn't going to be able to come in first thing, so I called letting them know it was no rush, he then preceded to tell me he could not make the copies (didnt call me with that info) and he would have to order from the company at $100 per key! I calmly said ok and he said 2 copies each? I said no I will pick up the keys later.  I then called the company myself and the cost I $35 for 2. These guys are scammers and I hope the Boss that doesn't pay OT takes Dale to task! What a bunch of BS and inconvenience he caused me.

Without knowing exactly what it goes to, we have a difficult time matching it.

<text>Went in for car key duplication. Waited a few minutes while they were helping other customers. When they got to me they quickly found the proper blanks and were able to give me 2 new keys that worked in all of my locks. While they made my keys they let me watch them use the machine. The gentleman lubed all of my car locks and even helped me find a lube I already had at my home that I could use on my locks. Everyone was very nice and friendly. 5/7</text>< Pictures>

Ordered keys for 2 cars, but both were wrong. The lady helping me over the phone was really lost/ disorganized. We had to wait for reorder. Came back a second time, but was only able to duplicate 1. My daughter is traumatized by dogs and for some reason, they had 2 large dog run out into the lobby. That really scared The s** out of my kids. . Oh well, 3rd time will not be a charm.<//Text>

I’d highly recommend this place!! My friend and I were running around town for almost 3 hours trying to get a copy of her car key. She has a 1990 Nissan 300 ZX  and the key split in half and no one would touch it. Ace hardware recommended I come here and I wish this was my first stop, it was fast, easy and the man(owner I think) that helped us was really helpful.  Thank you again!!</Review>

Just called and talked with a man named Dale to cancel an order for two key fobs that they charged $100 for each. I bought two of them for $35 on Amazon. I still wanted to have them cut two keys and program both keys and both key fobs but instead he got really rude about canceling my order. He said he was going to cancel my order and charge me a 25 percent (that’s $50) restock fee and not to come to his store and look for someone else. On top of all that he hung up on me!! How unprofessional!! I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. I understand the frustration with losing sales by online dealers but he was still looking at making some money for programming all four for me. I hope he doesn’t act like that with anyone else again. It’s not good for business. I’ll be disputing the return payment with my credit card company too.< /Text>

Knowledgeable, Professional and Reasonable. I took my car to them after the key broke off in the ignition. They had to pull the ignition to extract the broken piece.  They reassembled everything,  made some extra keys for me and made sure everything worked correctly.<//Text>

i called for help, and Derick assured me that my mercedes had a spare key built into the clikcer - i have owned that car for 20yrs and did not know that - so i go over and sure enough Derick showed me where the key was, I felt like a fool, but Derick was a professional - replaced the batteries in the keypad made me two keys to open the car manually - Derick provided me with an excellent service, he was courteous, polite, profession and best of all me heard my issues and came up with solutions - i can't say enough good things about them - Thank you!!!<//Review>

<date>1510334597177<//date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>Great experience... I've been to this locksmith several times.  Every time they've been great!  This last time I needed keys for my foreign scooter, because I only have one set of keys.  They tried to make the keys without the scooter, and guaranteed that if they didn't work they would remake for free and to please bring the scooter in to verify that the new keys would work.  Well they didn't work, and I did come back with the scooter... now I have three sets of backup keys that I didn't have before!
Any issues that other reviewers may say about poor quality is bogus, they just didn't want to take the time to go back and give them a chance to make it right.
Highly recommend.< /review>< Pics>

They are always quick, efficient and accommodating to my needs. With commercial property management, last minute needs for re-keys and replacements of stolen lockboxes are a regular occurrence, a quick call to their shop and I usually have the issue resolved with in 24-48 hours and for a reasonable price. In regards to some of these bad reviews I saw, I don't have this experience with S&S because I make it a point to be clear and concise on what I am requesting, which helps to ensure the job that is done aligns with the job I need, i recommend you make sure you know what you are asking for to avoid any errors. The safe and secure team can only perform to the expectations you set, if you are not clear about them, of course there will be an error. Safe and Secure locksmith in Murrieta is my #1 go to vendor for all of my property's locksmith needs in the Murrieta/Temecula/Menifee/Perris area and i HIGHLY recommend them.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I came in early this morning with my daughter in law, my grandson had snapped the car key off in the door. The owner and his wife we're a great help to us. He even jokingly told us he'd refund us ten times our money if the key  didn't work. Great family owned company that I'd recommend to anyone</Text>< UserId.>

<text>Do yourself a favor and don’t go this location, a beautiful store with really really bad and poor customer service from DALE which I believe he’s the owner,he was very rood to me when I came back with two key blanks that not working anymore after only 2 weeks! When I asked for refund he refused and told me to leave the store I found a much better Locksmith with better price , they should work on a better customer service or change Managment<//text>< pics>

Made a trip to the store to get a couple blank car keys cut (no transponder) I couldn't believe how cheap it was. 5 mins later I had two great keys that work smoother than the original. I Highly recommend this place.</Review>

My standard poodle Bruno LOVES every one at Julie's.  He has been getting groomed there once a month for the past 8 years.  He comes home looking like a movie star 🌟  and I know they treat him like one.   I would never even consider taking him anywhere else.<//review>

Manny and his staff at Julie’s are like second family to our boyz. They’ve been going there regularly for eight to nine years now.

Every time they come home, I can never get over how powder fresh they smell, and how soft they feel for days (if not weeks) afterwards. Buddy has always been a little skittish, so getting him in the door can be a challenge, but once in the shop,  the crew take great care of him and calm him down.

I recommended a friend to Julies’s. Upon grooming that dog, Chuck, Manny informed the owner that Chuck may have an ear infection that needed seeing to (Chuck did indeed - which accounted for his weird mood - and a trip to the vet followed). They care for the dogs we entrust to them. I can’t recommend them enough.

It is wonderful to have such a good, professional and caring business in our community.</text>

<text>We have been taking our dog Ruby to Julie's for 7 years and have had a fantastic experience every time. Our dog Ruby has been skittish ever since we got her from the pound. My wife and I were always apprehensive to take her to a groomer. Manny and his staff always treated her well and she is happy to walk in the door every time we take her to get groomed. You know that when your pet is excited to walk through the door that where you are taking them is a great place. This is the case every time we take Ruby there<//text>< pics>

Terrible service. Horrible training on Manny.
Manny does not deserve to work with our furry friends. He neglects them in the most horrific ways. Keep your pets away from this place to keep your furry friends safe from ALL harm. Unacceptable to be supergluing flesh on an animal that WAS in pain, and yelping because of the severe pain. Who knows what more Manny has done or is still doing to our pets once we leave the store?<//Review>

Do not take your pets here! Terrible service and the owner Manny skinned a dog that went in for a trim. Worst part about it is that they tried to super glue a body part back onto the dog that THEY did damage too. & TRIED to hide it...There is evidence, and I beg new comers to take your sweet pets somewhere else.  I know this Is kind of hard to believe, but again there is evidence, and I would not lie when it came to a business like this.</Review>

Julie’s pet grooming was referred to me by a friend. This place is a little hidden gem, I must’ve passed this place more than100 times and never knew it was there.   I took my two Beagles for a bath and was greeted by Manny.. He is a very friendly, pleasant guy since it was the 1st time using his services he explained everything in detailed. I was surprised the bath included a complete grooming as well; the price is exceptionally reasonable. I’ve used other groomers who charged twice as much for a bath, done less  grooming , & when I’ve  picked up my dogs they were still dampened. I was pleasantly surprised to see what an amazing job Julie’s groomer did on my  Beagles. Their coat looked clean and shiny, & both they smelt beautiful! It’s was also the first time their nails were cut short. My dogs had never had a decent, short trim even when I’ve taken them to the Vet’s for a trim. I’m so happy I was told about this place and I definitely recommend it. From here on out I will use no other groomer then Julie’s.  Thank you again Manny and to your staff for the impeccable service and wonderful job well done!!!< /text>

This was my dogs first professional, non-mobile grooming since her adoption. I was hoping for it to be not traumatic for her. She has an autoimmune syndrome that affects her fur and needs to be rinsed very well. Her fur came out AMAZING, and has stayed clean for quite a while!! The receptionist said that the groomer spent a little time with her prior to bathing, to calm her down. And, she was no more anxious than i would expect when I picked her up. I'm very impressed and will continue taking my dog there!<//review>

Hi I have taken my dogs to Julies grooming for more than 15 years and I have always had a positive experience while taking my dogs to get groomed. I feel the need to comment in leu of the negative comments that have been recently shared about Julies. My dog Kiwi likes going to Julies. Pre- pandemic he would pull us to the door. I like how Manny takes the time to know all of his fur friends and calls them by name. I have always felt safe leaving Kiwi at Julies. Which is why learning about Charlie caught me by surprise. What happened to Charlie is very unfortunate, I too would have been sad if this happened to my dog. I truly wish Charlie a speedy recovery. However, we are all human and people make mistakes. I respect the fact that many spoke up about the accident, he didn’t deny it. What I don’t agree with, is people being so mean or name calling. I don’t agree with people trying to sabotage someone’s Buisness.  We are in a terrible Pandemic and need to be supportive of our local  community businesses.< /review>

I have been bringing my dogs here for years and the cuts and service only get better. Yesterday I took my dog in for a haircut. Unfortunately in May he broke his leg so with cast on unable to bath. He needed a haircut and bath so badly since cast came off on Monday. They carefully bathed and groomed him and he looked wonderful and I could tell he felt so much better. Only place I will take my dogs.<//Review>

<Text>I am a new puppy owner and Manny took the time to walk me through the steps of how to groom so patiently!  He even took the time to give me a heads up about what shots to get prior to , to ensure that my puppy does not get sick.  At my appointment, he took the puppy curbside and was careful not to place her with other dogs as she is super tiny and young.  She came out smelling and looking like flowers!  LOL  Highly recommend this groomers... A+ service.< /Text><Date>1591251508970</Date><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This place is so great. Mobile groomers were my preferred choice because my dog has issues with other dogs. However, over the past few years I have not been able to find one that is reliable- some of them won't even bother returning your calls.

The owner here is a really nice guy - very personable. Their prices are very reasonable compared to mobile groomers.

My dog is a german shepherd and she has that thick undercoat, which tends to get a dry, straw texture. All I had them do was a bath with a fur treatment and her fur stayed soft for months.

I strongly recommend this groomer for all sizes and fur types. They are very affordable, friendly and reliable.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c1601ca78841:0xde8c7565a169ae3f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

What a fantastic place! Julie's Dog Grooming was recommended to me by a groomer down the way who does not do cats. I thought that was a nice gesture. I called and was super lucky to get an appointment that same day. I spoke with the super cool groomer to discuss what services I wanted, and she got to work right away.< /review>

*Avoid*  The owner does not care about your dogs well being.  He will rush the process so he can make as much money as he can in a day and your pet can suffer greatly because of this.<//Review>

Julies is fabulous,  friendly staff, they do a great job on Amelia my Multipoo.  Call for an appointment,  they get booked fast. Usually 5 9am walkins are accepted because they are so busy.  Walk in are done last, so don't be in a hurry, usually after 4pm, or they will call you when ready.
Great job. thanks, Dave Triggs<//text>

<Review>I gave one of the employees $100.05 to pay for my food and the employee dropped the .05 cents on the ground and snatched my $100 out of my hand and gave me a handful of change back. I'm not complaining about the food I am complaining about the service. Only 1 person in there was a respectable employee. This happened in Ceres ca. Please be kinder to your customers. I was not rude to you don't be rude to me. Thank you!</Review>< rate>

<Text>On Saturday 5/15 I went thru the drive thru the service was great I ordered two Chicken sandwiches and a large fry I took my meal home while eating my sandwich I noticed that there was no taste to the chicken sandwich it tasted stain like old bread I thought it was just me so when I ate the second sandwich it tasted like the first one I ate I came to the conclusion that it was deep fried in old rancid oil  and that is my belief.    Nasty never again will I eat at kfc</Text><Rating>2<//Rating><Time>1621403706466</Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>Horrible drive thru. Very unprofessional and rude staff.
Made the mistake of not checking food before we left. The chicken looked like it was burnt from being so dried out. Won't be going back here.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
I tried the Kentucky Fried BBQ wings today at the behest of the Kentucky Fried Chicken workers on Whitmore in Ceres. They were actually quite tasty. Nevertheless I found my visit to KFC completely disturbing. It had nothing to do with the great customer service skills that were exhibited by the young man or the team workers there, but it had everything to do with the fact that I couldn't eat but two pieces of chicken wings.
I've been finding lately that I don't even have an appetite to eat , and I love to eat.
Today I had a awful experience as I started new job last week. To give you a brief synopsis of the false accusations, no the LIE that was directed towards my conduct and character in my integrity. I'm going to submit a review on Big J's Tire and Turlock California. I didn't want to submit a review but I believe I'm owed and apology because my integrity was challenged falsely. I could've have been fired. So hopefully that's why I can eat tonight the beautiful meal that was prepared by those teenagers inside of Kentucky Fried Chicken. It must be difficult for them in the pandemic that being that they've never experienced anything like this in their lives. So for myself and for all the honest workers in Fast Food and Health Care and Retail and the great police officers that police the cities kudos to us<//Review>

Its KFC either you like it or hate it. I happen to love it. I've been eating at the ceres location on Whitmore av for 30 years.
It's always been consistent to me. They have a few characters that work there that make it fun to shop there. I wish I was good with names. They are able to cheer you up just by the way they speak into the microphone. Customer service, yeah.</Review>

I go with my wife to this lovely place many times a year! This is my favorite spot to have a bite.  I visit this spot at least once a month. The meals are great, the crew is courteous and the prices are decent. I like being in this restaurant to have a good meal.< /Review>

Seams newly remodeled, very clean. The manager is very personable yet a top notch professional. Good music playing, plenty of parking, well lit inside. I felt very comfortable and safe eating my lunch here.

BatesX3 from Kansas City would eat here again.< /review>

<Review>I go all the way to the other side of Ceres just to get my KFC from this restaurant - as the one by me doesn't know how to run a restaurant!!  My only problem is when I want to order 10 pc bucket - they usually don't have that much extra crispy on hand and it's a long wait for them to cook.  So I have to remember to call and make sure they have it by the time I show up!!
The always have good service and good food - THEY know how to run a fast food restaurant!!  Thank you!!< /Review>< time>

Great service. Had to wait a bit because our order was pretty big but the girl behind the counter was spot on at her job. Very friendly and she made sure everything we ordered was in the bags. I appreciate great customer service. I wish I could remember her name.<//text>

Service is outstanding. They really care about giving you a good experience. Food is what you'd expect from KFC. Haven't had a bad meal there and I've been there many times. Definitely notice whether the biscuits are fresh are not though, depending on how soft they are. Highly recommend.</Review>

<text>It started with excitement.  The man behind the counter was nice, although load. And down hill from there. There wasn't many people but took at least 20min. For food & that was after asking for it. Then as we left there was no toilet paper.  After asking 4 times for it, it took 1 of us getting mad.  Then came washing the hands time. OMG  it's been awhile since someone washed the sink. Never again.  Never..<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x8091ab3346185317:0x5c0056fabb325608</Gmap_id></record>

I don't like all KFC restaurants, but this particular one is great! Always fresh clean and curtious! My family and I come here often and have always been served wonderful food!
The one I avoid is the one on hatch off of Mitchell. Uugh always substandard!< /text>

Hit and miss.  A month ago food was fresh, hot, and delicious.    Last week chicken tenders cooked twice or totally forgotten in the fryer.  Today drive thru only able to handle one car at a time.   Take order, give order, take next order.  3rd car in line can leave u in the drive thru for 1/2 hr.  Called office.  No answer.  Asked for manager and surprise no manager on duty. Get 2 window and they are now out of what I ordered.  And are confused as to what I ordered.  REALLY?   Not worth the frustration.  Crispy chicken hot, fresh and delicious.    Substituted original looked cooked twice.  And barely warm.   Ya just never know what your going to get here.  Looked like a bunch of kids lost in a restaurant.  Should I call to see if there is a manager on duty before I go?< /review>

Nobody was there and the employees were very polite but you can see their impotence by not having the tools to work properly. They had a whole section closed because they said just got cleaned and we don't have access to the clean area, only to the one that is not clean. The soda machine was not working properly , I got water with a orange color, I don't know why.<//text>< pics>

<Review>It doesn't matter what time I go there... they are always out of chicken (so they tell me). They don't want to make more, if I try insisting they tell me it will take 35 40 minutes. I KNOW IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT LONG. The staff here are extremely lazy and unprepared. I've even been told on 2 occasions "there is another KFC on Hatch and Mitchell rd). This kfc is a waste of time< /Review>< Rate>

Normally the service is excellent here - usually much better than the one combined with A&W at Mitchell and Hatch, but not so much this time.

I ordered the 8-piece meal. For starters, I was told they were completely out of the cole slaw. Really?! KFC's cole slaw is as much a signature item as their chicken. I should have just left then, but I was hungry for the chicken.

I had to wait quite a while for the order as they apparently did not have any corn ready. But it eventually was done and I got my order. I was pretty surprised when I got home to find that I was ripped off on the meal. Normally an 8-piece meal includes two of each: breast, wing, thigh, and drumstick. Instead, with this order I got zero breasts, 1 thigh, 5 (FIVE?!) drumsticks, and 2 wings.

Also, minor but also indicative of things - the corn normally comes on a stick, these did not.

Since I did not see a manager (I know the usual one well and he normally does a good job), I have to assume that since it was after 8, they were in the "getting off work soon" mode of operation and didn't really care about good customer service.

So buyer beware if it's getting a little late here.</Review>

<review>I went last night Sep, 1st. 16. And I order a mashed potato bowl. The cashier tells me there's no corn, will that be ok? I said I guess . I get to the window( I was in the drive thru) and I ask her do I get a discount since I get no corn. She tells me sorry we can't do that. I said is that right? But you can short the customer? What's wrong with this......< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Nice people and detail oriented. They pretty much hand washed the truck. Definitely put an effort. Not exactly satisfied with the aluminum trailer and stainless steel parts wash, could use some better chemicals, it ended up not really clean, even though they spent a lot of time on it.<//review>

<Text>Failed to inform me it would be an extra $15. To wash the roof. when I mentioned the roof and get washed they offered to redo the vehicle but would charge me the full price plus the $15. I'm the price list inside the opposite does not state that there is an extra charge for the roof..... Also they did not use an air hose to get the water out of the cracks, and ended up with drip lines from the doors windows and mirrors.</Text><name>Lynn Lowe</name>< user>

<review>The worst experiences every they prioritize by how much your paying if someone is paying more than you they go first and you have to wait in line the lady there does not even know the prices of the washes she gives you one price then another if you can go to another truckwash I highly recommend it....and at the end they do a horrible JOB...read the other reviews and nothing is true  Waste of time and money Must  Be old reviews...<//review>< rate>

Tried this place for the first time, since it was close too home. 3 guys scrubbed down the rig and did a great job, with a smile on their faces. RV was washed/dried/tires blackened for $1.75 foot. Even scrubbed the roof for an extra $15. Very pleased...< /Review>

I would not recommend getting alignment done here. Came in asked for an alignment and tire rotation. I didn’t received any numbers prior or after just a “you’re good to go” with a handwritten receipt. Went to bigger chain company because my front tires blew out on the highway. The shop said my alignment was so bad that there is no way anyone touched it recently. They gave me a printout if the before and after numbers and what a difference in how the car drives. Maybe the other services here are ok but having my alignment done here cost me $500 in new tires and alignment because these guys want to make a quick buck.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>GREAT customer service!!! I was so impressed. I have an Audi S3 that I love and honestly don't trust a lot of people to take good care of it. I got a nail in my tire and Byron Woodley patched it up nicely. I wouldn't normally post a review after such a simple service, but I was so impressed by the honesty and respect that I received. Gary was so friendly, respectful, professional and understanding when it came to taking great care of my S3. I highly recommend this place! I'll be taking my S3 here for all my tire needs:)< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>Just a great place. They have repaired tires for us several times. Patching a nail puncture was very quick and cheap. Last time my husband went, they didn't even charge him to check out the tire and make sure it was safe.< /text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I’ve been a loyal Byron Woodley client since 1994 and have only had great experience. Just recently during a service at Calabasas Mercedes Benz I was told there was a nail in my tire and that I needed a new tire even though this tire was brand new. I said I’m sure I can have it plugged up and the Mercedes Benz service person said no you have to buy a new tire and then gave me the price of the tire. I said I’d feel better if I took it to Byron Woodley. I rolled into BW with a nail in my tire. After 15 minutes the gentlemen came and said I had three nails in 2 tires, but they didn’t puncture the tire. There was no charge. Can you imagine when Mercedes Benz would’ve discovered I had three nails they would’ve wanted to change 2 tires and charge me over $600.<//review>

No nonsense. They won't try to sell you things you don't need or ask for. Also--you can go to the bar behind their business and have a beer while you're waiting. A big plus.< /review>< Resp>

<text>Super helpful guys. They ordered a new tire for my boss and when he got there, they told him they could patch his old one that another place had just told him was unpatchable. They can also handle large Sprinter vans, which was not easy to find on the Westside.< /text>< Response>

This place is amazing.
I've been using them for years and they continue to amaze me with the 'we're not in this to rip people off' attitude.
I called around Santa Monica for new tires for my Volvo. Woodley was $250 cheaper than the other places AND they told me there was a rebate on the tires for $60 and I'd get a credit card for that amount. NO other place even mentioned it (meaning-they keep that for themselves). So I saved $300+ over the next lowest place.
And it's all done in an hour. Love.< /text>

<Review>There service was prompt and the price was reasonable for a tire repair. Although I instructed them specifically on the tire that I believed had the slow leak and they checked the opposite tire they handled the repair quickly and got me out of the shop in the time they promised.</Review>< pics>

<Text>I had the best experience here yesterday!! I called in to ask if they had my tire size and the gentleman on the phone said: Yes it would take about 45 mins.

BTW at BMW they said it would cost upwards of $600 ....

Anyway I got both tires put on for $80 and less than 15 mins.

Very honest and good working guys her!

Thanks again!< /Text>< Time>

<Text>DO NOT TAKE YOUR BUSINESS TO THESE JERKS!
I bought tires from them twice and took my car in there consistently for tire rotations as they recommended. About six months ago they did an alignment for me. Today when I went in for my six month rotation they told me the back tires were 80% worn due to a bad alignment! When I said they had done the alignment they got extremely rude. Very very rude! They keep no records at all in their computer regarding the work they have done on your car! I will never go back and I hope you don't either.< /Text>< Time>

<pics>None< /pics><text>I went in VS to return bras that did not fit. Cashier 3186380 offered the worst customer service. She asked me to hold up each bra that I was returning to scan the barcode without explaining why I was doing that job for her. If you needed me to hold things up or put the bras into a bag, take a moment to let me know, "Due to the pandemic, we are trying to limit as much contact as possible. Would you mind holding up the bras so that I can scan them without touching them?" Make things clear before you ask the customer to do different things is respectful. Be clear about store policies and don't let your guests feel like they are dirty or something.

Also, her whole attitude when I asked for an exchange was one that made me feel like she would rather not. When I asked if I could try on an alternate size in store before ordering a different size, she failed to explain that the store does not allow any fittings currently. She simply ordered new bras for me in a different size when I explained multiple times that I wished to try them on to see if they fit before ordering new ones.

The only person that felt warm and welcoming was the lady at the front of the store who was greeting. Now I have to return to the store to with bras that I didn't want to order. What a waste of time and unpleasant experience.< /text>< name>

Excellent perfume, Victoria's Secret Bombshell Seduction. I am giving one star less, because some of their floor employees are too nosey, (like the guy below in the pic), would start a conversation and not leave you alone.  During sales and busy hours, cashiers are excellent at their job, they keep the line moving pretty fast.< /Text>

<text>Greatest customer service ever.  Azaria measured my cup size by eye and was dead on even though I'd never bought a Victoria secret bra before and the sizes run different.  Have a new addicted customer! Great selection even during sales. Can't wait to come back!<//text>< pics>

<review>Very busy location. They don't allow men (as your partner/husband) to come in to the dressing room with you, which is very annoying. I understand, other ladies might not want to see other men in that area, but why not make a different area and call it a family dressing room?
Also, now they got a different CEO and the style is just not the same (I personally don't like it) - it's all about being sporty/comfy now. But what about the old school sexy? Not in style anymore?<//review>< pictures>

Who doesn't love Victoria's secret. But the girls are so helpful I took my husband in there so he can get me my Christmas gifts. told the girl what I like what I dislike and he told the girl what he would like and she walked him through the whole entire store helping him pick out things I might like as I enjoyed myself at the food court 😁<//Text>

Great and friendly customer service!  An associate helped me pick out something I was looking for and was very patient.  I also dealt with two other associates and they were also very pleasant.<//Text>

At least they had fair customer service today. I don't shop VS because everything is over priced and I don't care for their selection, I was given a gift card for my birthday so that is the only reason I even made a visit there.</Text>

Nice I got my girlfriend a lotof stuff here. I have never met her in real life because she lives in Bolivia, but she really loves me.Especially when I send her gifts like the underwear but even more when I send her $$$. She likes to hold me accontable so I never forget to pay her every month. She is saving up to come visist me. I think it kind of weird that ive been sending her a thousnad dollars a month and she still cant afford a plane ticked though.< /review>

I love Victoria Secret! If you just want to see your bra size you don't have to buy anything and they'll do it for free. And if you do want to buy something, they have a large variety of lingerie, bras and under wear. They are a little pricey, but they have some sales and deals sometimes. They are super nice as well, great service!😄👍< /Text>

If I could give ZERO stars I would. Horrible experience. I returned TWO pairs of pajamas, and TWO pairs of slippers and had no receipt due to Christmas. They said they are going to MAIL me my refund??? Makes NO sense. We waited almost two weeks and then when we called back their customer service it turns out I was issued a refund on a gift card but the associate that returned it for me or the manager- KEPT my refund and corporate verified the refund was used within AN HOUR of returning my items. WORST experience ever. I will not shop at this store again. Beware. They will RIP you off.</Review>

<text>Today I shopped here and  was very happy how the manager helped. There waa a price  issue
The cashier told me that items were not on sale.  But the associate on the floor gave me the price. When the manager waa called ahead was so professional and shorted out the issue  in a very polite. Manner.   Great personality.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

It took a while for me to find a staff member to help me, but once that search was completed she helped me find what I was looking for pretty quick. I imagine she helped me find the most expensive bras they had, but it met my goal and after about 10 minutes and breaking the piggy bank I had what I needed and was out the door. The staff was very friendly... what else can be said about an underwear store?<//Review>

I came in today for a free beauty gift and  I have a special weekend coming up for my birthday next month. Well, I was having a hard time with perfume since I prefer fruity and my partner likes flower scent and wanted a perfume that we will both enjoy for that occasion. Their associate, Blue or Blu, introduced me to wild flower and it was perfect and she went to back for me to get what I wanted. She had a great attitude, super nice, and extremely helpful.<//review>

<review>I love shopping Victoria Secret PINK. The current product line is not as great as what they have had in the past. The service in store has gone down hill. I recently went in and they forgot an anti-theft device on one of my bras. I had to go all the way back to the store and the associate who removed it was not very pleasant. She did not even apologize for the mistake. The seasonal employees were much better. Service in this store has really gone down hill.</review><username>Heather de Vries</username>< date>

<review>Before my most recent visit, it had been years since I've been here. I am a DDD and that has always proven to be problematic. I've hated bra shopping because of it, however, Victoria Secret has really changed how they do things.
I went in, got measured and was sent straight to the dressing room (nothing in hand besides my card). They had me try on a bra in my measurement and confirmed it was a comfortable fit. From there I was given 4 different styles of bras based on what I was looking for. Once I had picked out the bras I liked they wrote down the styles and my sales lady took me around the store so I could pick out what color I wanted in each.
I bought 4 bras (unheard of for me) and it was so painless. I love each one of them, even the strapless. And none of them are bulky or unflattering. I haven't felt this good in awhile.
Only downside, it was crazy busy and most of my time was spent in a queue.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x809ada1ed4185189:0xb183d147d39f5649</gmap_id></record>

The employees here are always friendly and helpful. I have not had a negative experience with any of the employees on any of my trips here. However, even going here on a weekday in the afternoon when it isn't busy, the clothing/garments are a bit unorganized and many things misplaced. For example, a lot of the bras and undies will be in the wrong size area (like the smalls mixed with mediums and larges) which can make shopping frustrating and take longer than necessary. I have also tried to buy things that were in the clearance area only to find out when checking out that they were not on sale and just misplaced. My only complaint would be that they keep their items more organized.<//text>

The prices of their bras, which seemed similar in style to the ones At JC Penny are double the price.

The sales people are super helpful and most of the time I find what I need. Today wasn't that day though. They didn't have the underwear I wanted in my color or size and I had to forgo the sale they had going on because the warehouse didn't have it either.< /text>

I don't give 5 stars just because there's always 1 or 2 at cash register and the waiting time to pay is long, other than that love the clothes and fragrances< /text>

Clean and well kept. Employees have their off and on days. If you need help ask, they don't always offer help. Always use your coupons and be adamant about it.< /Review>

<text>I wish you can rate no stars.
I was there with a friend and waisted 45min of my life because they refused to return two bras that were purchased from online because we didn't have the gift with purchase. I asked were does it say that at and one associate said "to my knowledge that's the policy" asked to speak to manager who then said "well its not on the return slip anywhere but its the right thing to do." I have never been so disrespected. I called customer service on my phone and they explained that isn't the policy and I asked the customer service rep to speak to the manager and he refused to take the phone. They did the return. The corporate rep called me back and apologized for the experience. I hope he had stock in the company because he did all that over a free item. It's not like Victoria secret goes and sells the gift with purchase after is returned. Horrible customer service. To top it off when walking out I asked to get the store managers name and the associate said we are not allowed to give out that information. I said ok can I leave my number and she can call me "well I can but I can't guarantee she will get the information" is how she responded.</text><UserId.>105848509487545031508<//UserId.><time>1520270215551< /time>< name>

Visited during the holiday season, most of the sales items were lack luster and it was difficult navigating the store with the surplus of very large women digging through the bins everywhere. Staff was friendly and nice.< /Review>

So although I'm giving a five star review it's only based on the customer service I received from one person Julia Jaleah Holcum. I had the worst experience with my online order. Order lost butvwhene replaced I only got partial items & over charged and to top it off a supervisor failed to fallow thru with replacement order or inform me it was not gonna happen due to discontinued items. This rep Julia took the time to correct my order, replaced never received item at no cost to me free expedited shipping. I received fallow thru emails and gift card for my inconvenience. She Rocks but the customer service center for online needs an update. I've got many years of customer and never seen such bad service but again 5 stars based on reps who do there job.<//review>

<Text>I agree If I could give them a rating of no stars I would I found the staff was courteous but so self involved that they pointed me to the wrong item and walked away. The ones that were helpful were so busy they were short because they were stressed out from being over worked. My biggest problem with this store and company in particular is FRAUD This store has GIFT CARD FRAUD internally. They thing that gets me is they know about it but seem to care. I contacted the 1.800 as instructed and was denied anything in return for my loss even when they found that my GIFT CARD was used in a different state and a city I've never been to.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>This place is so unpleasant.  It is usually always very crowded (body to body, wall to wall),the atmosphere is very tense and kinda nerve wracking as shoppers treat the displays, racks, drawers like a flea market on Black Friday every day, tossing all the nearly folded impeccably designed lingerie everywhere.  Finding specific styles is kinda challenging, price matching is very ymmv, and online returns?  Forget about it!  These guys can't follow policies to save their jewel encrusted lives; I bought a gift online, the gift recepient wanted to exchange it, they went to the store gave them the gift receipt and they refunded it back to a closed account that was never even originally charged to begin with, sending her refund to transaction purgatory.  They have refused to provide me with a transaction ID to claim the funds. ::Eye roll::<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x809ada1ed4185189:0xb183d147d39f5649<//gmapID></record>

<user_name>Bridgett C<//user_name><date>1477960447555<//date><rate>1</rate><review>Wow... Customer service lacks so much at these stores. I always order online so I don't have to deal with the crowd and rude staff. They are too focused on their personal non work related conversations than to help a customer. I only go into the store if I absolutely have to return an item, and even then the wait is always longer than 45 mins. The stores are never clean, clothes are everywhere and they never have my size in stock. As a VIP angel card holder it's disappointing to have to deal with the store. Really wish management would look at these stores and retrain.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<rate>1<//rate><text>You have to study the sales online first so that you can make the staff honor the sales.  I bought a robe that was part of the 40% off pj sale and was told that it wasn't on sale but they said would honor it cuz I could on the app that it was on sale, like they were doing me some kind of favor. I've been told in the past, at the checkout  that I could only use one reward card even though I told her that if I was ordering online I could use up to 3 rewards cards.  She said that the cash register would only allow her to do one.  Was told that I had to spend $40 dollars to get the $20 holiday card until I showed her that the ad said that I could get it with any purchase.  Think of all the customers that should of gotten the card but didn't.  All of this I feel is intentional cuz I would think that a big company like VS would make sure all employees would know what the current deals are.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>For a store that specializes in bras, they never seem to have the right sizes in stock. I think the way they force their salespeople to be so pushy and keep greeting customers who obviously would rather be left alone is tacky. And, I'm still mad at VS in general for discontinuing their entire clothing line, especially the Kate fit pants.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Its a decent location... Gotta say if you come on a buy 7panties for $30, semiannual sale or similar promotion of course its going to be crowded!! The only times ive experienced 45mnts wait line are on semiannual sales... When there is 100+ girls going crazy over panties... And that goes for the 10+ VS's stores ive been on...

Yes floor sale girls are not always helpful but that's okay... U are a girl and u ought to know ur sizes rite? And clueless man like myself usually get good service...

Cashiers yes ... They are usually too bubbly... But ithink they do fast enough work having in consideration ive always bring my panties on a bunch and they unbunch them... And fit them nicely... And usually everyone does that....

The pic is on a .. Regular Sunday at 2-3pm. The offers on today are buy $40 get a $20 reward card  with $10bralletes/sports bras and some people have buy $30 get 2 free panties... So its not a non promotion day and the store looks neat enough< /text>
