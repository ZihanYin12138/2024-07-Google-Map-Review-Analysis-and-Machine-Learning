<rate>5</rate><Review>To say I am satisfied with the service I received at Encore would be an understatement. From the first time I called to make an appointment to the time my vehicle was repaired, the service I received was top-notch. We are a one car family and I was worried about being without a car for a couple of days and they said they have a loaner vehicle I could use in the meantime. Wow! Absolutely won me over as a customer for life! If you need your vehicle repaired don’t waste your time calling around...just go to Encore!</Review>< Pictures>

Thank you to the team at encore automotive for the best customer service. Not my first time here, i brought my ford explorer here last year for a whole new AC replacement, still working blowing ice cold. Today i took my ford explorer to get some suspension work done. I originally went in to get my upper/lower control arms replaced, as they looked into it, they discovered a few parts needing attention. They do not push you to buy this, to buy that, they recommend things and it's up to the customer to decide what they want to do. Very clean work. You won't regret coming here. Courteous, Professional, and clean shop.< /review>

The inverted pump on our Prius went out. Encore was able to get us in and install a new inverter pump the same day. Encore followed up with us the next day to see how our car was doing. Their service was professional, prompt and reasonable.< /review>

If you are looking for Reliable Service People to take care of your Auto Issues or Maintenance don't hesitate to call Eric and discuss your problem or needs.  Eric is very knowledgeable and Service Oriented.  He Get's It!!!  Not only does he understand what you need but he will give you a detailed bid for the Labor and Parts it will take to complete the project.
In addition to Eric's professionalism and attention to detail there are the Mechanic's that Get the Job Done.
Encore offers a Shuttle Service if you need a ride to and from the Shop driven by none other than Erica, one of the Owners.  Erica is very pleasant and a Very Safe Driver, so you can feel Safe in her hands.
I am under the impression that Erica's Husband performed the work on my vehicle which Now Functions Perfectly.  He not only performed the repair, he called me a day or two later to find out how the repair was working and if I was satisfied with the repair.
Encore does it Right.   They are a Breath of Fresh Air working in a Profession that has a Reputation of taking advantage of people.
Don't take any chances.   Call Encore and be taken care of the way you expect.
I AM A VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!<//text>

<Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80daf7bb49ffb31d:0xafc8860f4b507625</Gmap_id><review>My family of 6 was on a road trip and still had a 9 hour drive ahead of us. Our vehicle was giving us some trouble and we called Encore for help. They were closing within 15 minutes of our arrival.
To make a very long story short this company went ABOVE AND BEYOND for us.
One of the gals at the desk drove me and 2 kids to 4 or 5 rental car places to help us locate a vehicle for us to continue on our road trip while they repaired our vehicle. We did not find one that would fit all of us anywhere.

So our insurance company ended up having to bring a vehicle to us but it would take quite a while because they were also closed. God was looking out for us in all of this. Almost three hours after Encore was closed Holman, the owner, was still as patient as ever. He didnt  even consider having us wait outside for the car to arrive. Holman was so pleasant while we watched TV to keep the kids occupied and drank all of his water in the mini fridge. :)
After being stuck at an exit in this summer heat...I appreciated the option to not have to wear a mask.  We all thought we were going to pass out from being on the side of the road. The owner never made us feel like we overstayed our welcome and was always extremely pleasant.

Our car was repaired a few days later and we picked it up on our way back from our family trip 7 days later. Holman kept in contact with my husband checking our different options and really felt like he was being honest and considerate to our needs. A few days after arriving home my husband received a text from Holman  to confirm we made it home safely and if everything went well. We really appreciate the kindness during such questionable times. Thank you Encore. If we are ever in town and need some assistance on our car again..we will be sure to stop in.< /review>< Name>

A perfect example of a very professional small business. Better than dealer quality work at a better value. Because they are independent, they are free to be honest with you about all the options for repairing or servicing you vehicle. Awesome family owned small business 👍.< /text>

The BEST Service with Honesty & Integrity never compromised!!!
Holman the Owner went out of his way to make sure the job was done right at an unbelievable price!
I was stranded and scared & had been to several automobile shops until I met Holden at Encore Automotive where he looked at my car free and then installed what I needed @ a fair. $. I got home home safe and sound. it was an unbelievable experience and I would advise anyone who needs car repair to go to Encore Automotive!< /review>

<review>If I could give these guys 10 stars, I would.  I was on a long-distance drive from Northern California to Ohio via "the southern route" (I-10 & I-40) and had spent the night in Indio.  On the road east-bound at 7 AM and 10 miles east of Indio my dreaded "check engine" light came on.  I quickly checked and no fluids or smells, so I turned around and went back to Indio.  USAA Roadside Assistance referred me to Encore and my Suburban was diagnosed with bad oxygen sensor.  Diagnosis and repair took less than 90 minutes. They literally saved the day for me.  Fantastic service and Holman from Encore texted me two days later to make sure all was good with the Suburban.  You just can't get customer service like this anymore and when you do, you support the business and the people!< /review>< resp>

<Text>Would have given them a higher rating had it not been for them driving my car recklessly. My boost gauge was reset by me upon arrival, when the car was returned to me it read over 14lbs. Then they said they didn't drive it hard, after I told them about the boost gauge, it's my car I know how hard you have to drive it to get to those boost readings. The work done was good but the lack of respect for someone's property earned them a bad review. Do with this information as you please, I'm just informing future customers of something to be cautious about when looking for a shop to perform services.

Update 9/302020
Holman reached out and decided to tell me that I chose the wrong words to explain the situation and that it's not okay to leave a negative review for a business that thrives on customer service, and tried explaining to me that turbo cars register boost and 22lbs of boost would be reckless driving and that 14lbs of boost isnt reckless driving. NO BOOST is the ONLY boost that should be accepted specially when you claim your employees dont do this type of behavior. If I could take off the last star I would, but do with this information as you please potential customers. Horrible customer service from this company. If they decide to reach out again to tell me I'm wrong I will update again, but a simple I'm sorry my employees did that goes a hell of a lot further than the deny everything approach this company took. The boost gauge doesnt lie. Learn from this mistake and move forward dont tell your customers that they're wrong when they caught you doing something you shouldnt be doing.</Text>< userid>

Excellent deals on quartz countertops, including prefab vanity slabs. Sinks are also good quality and very inexpensive. Minor downsides: the building does not (yet) have signage; and the parking lot is narrow, and doesn't have a lot of capacity. Unless you're picking up product, I recommend parking in the street.< /Text>

Was thrilled I happened to find this place! When you go in find what you want then wait to meet with someone at a computer station. He will show you what it looks like. I ordered 10 cabinets and 3 pieces of quartzite. I asked when could I pick them up and they said that day. I needed a few days. Crazy! They work like a well oiled machine. That night when I got home I discovered I ordered the cabinet over the fridge too high. Called to change, they said just make the change when I pickup.
So easy.<//Text>

H Cabinet is a warehouse, no frills. Everything is on display. They have cabinets, cabinet knobs, flooring, kitchen countertops of various materials, and stainless steel sinks. You browse and select then a rep will help you. If you bring your measurements they will put your cabinet selections in a CAD presentation. They will load your truck and you're done. They also offer cabinet assembly.
The parking lot is small, but it turns over quickly.<//text>

<Review>I would give them zero stars if I could. I read the earlier reviews
and thought I could power through the nonsense. It wasn't worth it.
The worst service I've ever experienced and total lack of professionalism.
They are disorganized and dishonest. Charged me twice for the same cabinet. They are thieves and don't care. Do the world a favor and don't buy from them. Their cabinets aren't anything special. Just more imported junk.
What I got was an order that was split and mismatched. Parts missing.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

sales people have zero people skills. very bad customer service. Borderline rude.  I shouldnt even place a star.  They is a sales rep with the initials ZW who is a piece of work.  If he is your sales rep...RUN  !!!!!  When I visited the store, I didn't have a good experience.  I thought ZW was just busy that day.  After 2 weeks, I called and while I still explaning, he suddenly he hung up on me while I was still talking.  There is a culture of dismissiveness in their Mira Mesa branch.</Review>

This is by far the very WOREST cabinet and vanity vendor in San Diego. Had to complete a BBB compliant due to the serious incompetent customer service by unknown woman that answers the phone who refused to give her name, she admitted to never repling to their emails, voicemail always full, no call backs and lack of professionalism by "Thomas" who refused to allow contact with the owner and hung up 4 times. All for a simply drawer face reorder for a bathroom vanity that the owner paid over $20,000 for the remodel. I seriously recommend not buying anything from this company to save you from the frustration and time wasted. We ended up buying whole new vanity because H Cabinets lack of service.</Text>

<Review>Customer service is way better at the Scripps ranch store.  This is the second time we have used them.  The cabinets are good quality, but not for the novice.  Think IKEA without the directions. Our contractor put  the first set together for us a few years ago. She had it done in no time.  This time it was just us.  Took awhile, but they look great. I took off a star for the poor quality of the YouTube video that his supposed to help with assembly.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>They hardly answer their phone.  It usually goes to VM. It's frustrating when you leave a message because they NEVER return a call.  When there,  the gal at the register is rude and doesn't want to be bothered.  She's busy texting on her phone.  My contractor complains when he picks up items,  the guy at the warehouse also has an attitude.  They have no idea of what customer service is!</Review><time>1565361350671<//time>< Resp>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Very poor customer service and poor quality quartz.
I'm very worried about the quality of my quartz. Everything seems to leave a mark, and even on the day of installation there were marks that could not be removed.  I thought they would be buffed out, but nothing changed. I had the installer back, with no improvement. I wanted to rip it all out, but was told that they will not take it back once installed.  I believe my contractor sent me to H Cabinets to save money, but poor quality is not a bargain!  My dream kitchen is anything but! From afar it looks beautiful, but I am afraid to set anything on it, move anything on it, leave a glass of water or coffee cup, etc.  And I am constantly trying to get it to look shiny and new.  Not up close!

The poor service came when I needed an additional five foot piece for a powder room, which I saw outside, but no one was available outside to help.  They said I had to pay for it before looking, then I could get my money back if I didn't like it.  I was to get a paper from Thomas first.  Thomas said I had to talk to the front desk first. Back and forth I went, both locations within hearing distance, in 100 degree heat, and I finally gave in to ordering a whole new piece to get out of there. Probably their original intent. I would never recommend their product unless you are doing cheap house flipping and don't care about the poor consumer.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

The worst company I have ever done business with. Nobody speaks actual English. They will get verbally angry at you for asking a simple question about their product if they can't understand the English you are using. They don't stand behind their product. I have been calling for 2 days asking if they have a simple product and they consistently ignore my calls or straight up hang up on me without explanation. I flip houses and have been using them for over a year. They could not care less about me or any other of their customers. Don't waste countless hours dealing with them, save yourself time  (which is money) and go elsewhere!<//Text>

<Review>Don't go there expecting great customer service. If you want that, go pay three times as much anywhere else. Only thing that gave it 4 stars is they refuse to provide directions. Not that I use them. But I keep ending up with way too many left over parts after building the cabinets and I think someone is messing with me.<//Review>< userid>

<text>Absolutely disgraceful customer service, if i was the owner and saw my employees act this way to customers i'd be furious. I've been a few times and every single time they act like I've asked them to perform some herculean task when it comes time to collect my order. Not building the order. Not assembling the order. Fetching the order that was already payed for.

While bad customer service is bad, i'm generally a pretty easy reviewer and a one star wouldn't be warranted unless something was fundamentally wrong with the business. In this case, I've done business with them previously and I had a significant amount of in-store credit saved up. They tried to cheat their way out allowing me to use it by charging nonsensical fees that would have amounted to over 25% of my credit. When pushed, they dropped it.

There are better options in San Diego, a quick search will give you several options. Avoid the headache of doing business with this deplorable company.< /text><name>Petros Moros</name>< date>

< Review>
The person at the pick-up counter of the cabinet is just like the one who is dying. It seems that who owes him money. The service attitude really loses the face of the Chinese. How can the boss of this company recruit such a person</Review>

Terrible customer service. I went back because their cabinets were missing parts and they wanted me to pay for them all over again. When I asked for the replacement they told me to f—-KC off and to leave. Don’t come here.<//Text>

<text>As per the person who posted before me, DONT BUY FROM HERE! Marble cracked in less than a year in so many places, customer service after they have your money is absolutely poor! Take your money elsewhere or else you’ll be like us and spend over 15 grand with a newly renovated kitchen that’s already falling apart!

DO NOT BUY FROM HERE, THEYLL CONSTANTLY HANG UP ON YOU TOO or continually lie when you need help! Believe the reviews because we didn’t check before hand and we’re outta luck now</text>< Resp>

<Review>I used to get burgers here all the time and I’ve never been disappointed! My family and I have been coming here for years. Never had one complaint, always great service as well. Food taste incredibly delicious and I love the safety measures they put in place for covid. Please go to this place, you won’t regret it. Can I rate it 6 stars??<//Review>< Pictures>

One of the best burger places around. The girls at the counter are super friendly and helpful. The portions are huge and delicious. The breakfast burritos are a staple in my house on Saturday mornings. The salads are always FRESH, the Zucchini & fries Crispy & the SHAKES are really good too.< /Text>

Their chilli cheese fries are to die for! Definitely recommend and the cool thing is you can make any sandwich into a combo with chilli cheese fries or onion rings or zucchini for a better price than getting them separate individual. Their chicken sandwich is good too. How ever their burgers are a bit over priced compared to other spots like tams if they lowered the burger price then I'd come every day 😎< /Text>

Loved the place because the service was great. We were helped quickly and the food came out fast and fresh. They let us change the channel on the television to something else as well. Probably our new Burger place for lunch.</Review>

This isn't your place to go to for a healthy meal option, but it's great for a bite to fill you up. It's not too far from my office so it's a regular stop. The staff is always friendly and quick to help. This place is great for burgers, sandwiches, and if you're feeling like a glutton, chili cheese fries.<//text>

I teach at a school right around the corner and have been going there for several years for lunch. I always get a burger and fries and it's one of my favorite burger places and great fries also. Definitely worth a try< /text>

Solid place with great prices. Two things that would make this better is not having  shady people looking to score change to get their drink on at the liquor store next door and the addition of a drive thru.<//Review>

This place has gotten too expensive. There isn't a range of soda drinks though which isn't cool. There's literally I think 5 to 8 soda/juice flavors.<//Text>

<review>BETWEEN THE REVIEWS w/ Rodney S

Q)  What brought you to Douglas Burgers, Rodney?
A)  Valpak, Rodney.  Valpak had a coupon for a BOGO 1/4 lb hamburger Mon - Thurs.  Seeing a good deal when I see one, I had to seize the opportunity.

Q)  How was Douglas' 1/4 lb hamburger?
A)  At only $2.99, the BOGO hamburgers were a definite bargain.  However, the patty was thin.  I'm talking almost "White Castle thin".  It does make for faster cooking time, but the thinness also made for a well done burger.  I would've much preferred a juicier patty with a little pink.  The usual tomatoes, onions, pickles & thousand island were present.  I always get my burgers lettuce-wrapped, and Douglas accommodated my request.

Q)  Rodney, what else does Douglas Burgers have to offer?
A)  An extensive menu, consisting of burgers, sandwiches, breakfast items, Mexican food etc. keeps diners guessing as to what to get.  Specials include a burger, fries & drink for $4.99.

Q)  Another other info you can share?
A)  Yes, Rodney.  Service was okay.  My order was taken quickly and I didn't wait too long before I was chowing down on my BOGO burgers.  Plenty of booth seating, with flatscreens to watch the latest soccer games.  Parking is in a private lot, with street parking available, too.  Douglas Burgers is located in a shady area. How shady, Rodney?  Well, the liquor store next to the restaurant has bulletproof plastic protecting the cashier.  Yeah, that shady.

Q)  Would you recommend eating at Douglas Burgers?
A)  Being that the burger patty was uber thin & the aforementioned neighborhood being not too family friendly, I don't recommend eating at Douglas Burgers.  There are plenty of similar options in and around my local area, that have juicier burgers and where I don't have to worry about someone busting a cap nearby & ruining my meal.<//review><name>Rodney S</name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>Best experience ever! Mr.Noe, the patriarch of this family business was extremely kind, helpful with the stressful situation of a car collision repair not at fault. He got the work done as agreed and on schedule. Thank you so much for your guidance and support. I will not need collision repair anytime soon. However, if I ever do I will definitely reach out to Mr. Noe at Avenue Body Shop. World class customer service and accountability.<//text>< pics>

Avenue body shop is the best body shop I've worked with. They are a family business and it shows. Avenue made my unfortunate car accident experience much better and were super helpful through the entire process from getting the car towed, to dealing with insurance, and estimating the repair. I would highly recommend them. They were very honest and straightforward through the whole process and were compassionate about my situation.< /Review>

<review>Excellent experience. Took good care of me and my Mercedes. I got into a fender bender on 8/27/19.  I got my car back on 9/13/19. I am happy with my experience at JP Auto Body Shop. John Jensen was the rep who helped me and he represents this business swell along with his self. There where two other individuals that assisted me with my tire pressure system when it would not read on my dash board and they where both down to earth and friendly excellent experience with them as well. You can not go wrong with this shop. I recommend this shop with high standards.<//review>< gmapID>

<review>Today I scratched my car pretty bad on one side.  I called up Avenue Body Shop and they had me drive it right over.  With an hour they had detailed out the damage.  Since it took less time to repair, they charged me less than the estimate without my even suggesting it.<//review>< pictures>

This body shop is awesome. Brought my golf in after a crash and Noe took care of everything and kept me updated the entire time. He spent time with me to sit down and explain everything and dealt with the insurance companies for me. They were quick, super friendly and easy to deal with. The car looks as good as new and I will definitely come back here next time. Thanks Noe.<//Review>

I have been taking our cars to Noe and his family for at least 10 years.  I send all my friends to them, so confident am I in their work and integrity. They do quick, flawless work, are completely honest, and always give you the best price they can. I just came home from their fixing our three year old BMW, as well as detailing it. It looks new.  But they also take just as much effort with a 19 year old Honda Civic that I park on city streets and that gets the heck beat out of it by careless drivers. They keep that one from becoming a jalopy, and always at an affordable price, since I am paying out of pocket. My insurance company also finds them fair and scrupulous. Go there and be happy!< /text>

I cannot say enough about the experience I have had at ABS. They arranged for my car to be towed, dealt with my insurance company and the company of the other involved driver, supplied an accurate estimate and explained it to my Insurance such that the work was expert and the restoration perfect. The painting, clear coat, and polish perfect.
Thank You, Avenue.< /Text>

After 7 years of living in San Francisco, finally i found a shop that is trust worthy and will not rip you off. Noe is very honest and makes sure your concerns are well taken care of. He works effectively with insurance to get repairs done. This is a family run shop, doing good and great work.

I will be referring my family, friends and colleagues to this shop and Noe.

I can't say enough wonderful things about these guys! My car was hit by a driver who didn't check his blind spot. This was my first time ever being involved in a collision so I was totally bewildered by the process, but they helped walk me through it every step of the way. It was a relief to have people who were on my side instead of the insurance companies' side! They worked with GEICO for me and helped me get a great resolution for the whole thing. Thanks, Avenue!< /Text>

Ive Been to a lot of smoke shops in Ceres and Modesto and I personally find this one to have everything I need and things I've wanted to try all at one Stop. The employees are professional answer all my questions with a knowledge based background to give u the right answer. Most Important is that I feel comfortable there being that it's a family owned business that treats you with kindness the moment you walk in the door even if your on a tight budget they will have something to help you out.
WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SHOP TO ANYONE!</Text>

These guys will tell you an original price and then say they’ll give you a good deal (Black Friday deal for me) and still charge you about 20% more than jays or up n smoke,,, don’t go here and save yourself some money.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><time>1542994529839<//time><gmap_id>0x809055911de21237:0xef7b9c2523c10e17<//gmap_id>< user_name>

<Text>Cool family spot - mini BWW. Arcade games for the kids is a huge plus...!
Probably should have Happy Hour specials. Especially on Monday afternoons... If it does have Happy Hour then it should be more apparent. Awesome that there is plenty of parking.</Text>< UserId.>

Best pizza on the planet. A little pricier than chain places but you definitely get your money's worth with toppings galore. They certainly don't skimp out. Nice atmosphere with sports on the TVs and plenty of games for the kids. Lovely family environment. Only caveat is they don't offer delivery. Can't wait to go back and enjoy the Grand Slam and an ice cold pitcher of beer when this pandemic is over. *sigh< /text>

We had a great 2nd birthday for my son today at Ballpark.  The owner went out of his way to make sure my party was taken care of. The food was good! The drink selection was good and the salad bar was on point! Thank you!  We will be back!<//review>

<Review>We love ball park pizza - we have been a resident in San Clemente for over 35 years and this is the best pizza and atmosphere we have found. Our grand children love the video and other games that ball park has to offer.
Keep up the great business atmosphere and wonderful pizza.< /Review>< pics>

This place is great if you have kids. Ample seating and a little arcade area with games my kids love. Some of the games are only $0.25, which is great because for a few dollars you can enjoy a beer or wine with your pizza while your kids entertain themselves for 5 minutes. My oldest talks about this place all the time and wants to go every time we say pizza. And the pizza is good, too! We love the BBQ chicken pizza.<//Text>

<Date>1598671686735< /Date><review>Hi, we have been getting the El Matador pizza for years.  Lately  it has been cheesy on the toppings that made it El Matador. Not sure whats going on, maybe holding back because of whats going on in our world. The toppings used to go within 1/2 an inch to the edge of the crust and it was thicker.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< user>

I was torn between 2 and 3 stars. Pizza is expensive and not worth the prices. Road bar is the same with so few options and only 1 trip to it. I'm surprised Its still open. Taste and quality can be achieved by some frozen pizzas. We were severely disappointed.</review>

<text>I often go here to get my sports fix and delicious pizza. I can't beat numerous screens with a variety of games all at once. They have something for everyone. I'm counting down to hockey season again. The pizza is delicious, expect to pay a bit more than your average Domino's or Pizza Hut. You're not getting just an average slice so it's worth it. The chicken topping on their pizza has a weird texture and taste, I recommend steering clear of it. I usually order the creamy garlic chicken pizza... Minus the chicken.  Definitely worth dropping into for a bite, a beer, and a few games.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>I decided to call Ball Park Pizza after reading the awesome reviews on yelp. I spoke with Amber about hosting my son's 4th birthday party. She was delightful and super easy to work with. They let me set up some basic decorations, they reserved the tables closest to the arcade so the kids could play while the adults could visit. WHAT A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!! Not only is the staff pleasant and helpful - you can tell they are genuinely nice people. My family, friends, children and friends' children all had a great time. Amber allowed me to put our cupcakes and birthday cake in the fridge until it was time and she was super helpful offering forks and a knife. Now let's talk food. The salad bar was clean, crisp and fresh. The guys liked the variety of beers on tap and the PIZZA IS AMAZING!!!
I'm excited to host or attend another kid's night at Ballpark Pizza. They even have an ice cream counter. I wish I could give them 10 stars.

Thank you for making my son's birthday easy, fun and memorable.

Until today's visit, this San Clemente Ballpark was a ☆☆☆☆☆ location, but since their recent remodel (signage and game area) they lost it with my kids... not only have some of their favorite games been replaced, a good portion are out of order.... I expect numerous games not functioning  in other towns...but this is Talega..lite a fire under the game owners and keep these machines up and running...we will come back in a while one more time to see if things have changed..
Food is always fantastic as well as the service, but we bring the kids for the games while my wife and I enjoy a drink and some decent food...< /text>

Pizza was ok super fricken loud and super fricken expensive.. 21 bucks for a pitcher of beer and pizza portions are tiny.... Not filling.... Thin crust medium cheeses 10 slices 19.50..... Way too expensive for a dive...< /Review>

Finally a place in Talega where I can take my kids. The owner use to own the Ballpark in San Juan he sold it a few years ago. And when I moved from san juan to talega it became a drive to eat pizza. But now there's this new ball park and I find out its the same owner and management! Delicious!

Thank you for bringing a family oriented place to the neighborhood be seeing you soon</review>

< Review>
Good taste, small wings.
Not your grandad Granites.
This place used to have big wings big sandwiches, friendly staff.
The NAME is granites but wow it sucks compared to the old owners.
Little wings with paltry meat. Not as many choices of heat. And the man and woman behind the counter were NOT friendly at all!
Plus $.85 per wing for such anorexic wings is a RIP off.

I was sad when I opened the box of wings at home and saw how small the wings were.
And no bucket of pickles like they used to have.

The best summary words will have to be "let down". The inferno was pretty decent taste wise.
I will not be returning.<//Review>

My family and I have been going to THIS Granite's for over 25 years.  They are the best sub shop around.  The steak combo sandwiches are so delicious as well as the other cold cut sandwiches.  My daughter loves the wings and poppers, too.  The service is always friendly, and the place is CLEAN.  Keep up the good work Janet and family.  You guys are awesome!<//Text>

Go to the correct Granite's! This one is near Orange Grove Ave. We've been going here for 14+ years and this is the only place I'll order chicken wings! They're very meaty and not fatty. Love the railroad sandwich combo too. The decor isn't great but it's clean, they get a ton of regulars,  and the owners are sweethearts!</Text>

<Text>Will not be going back.  The guy working there was rude.  The wings tasted like vinagear, and the BBQ Beef sandwich was so salty.  Could only take a couple bites.  Hadnt been there in some time.  Used to be good.  Not anymore.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>This restaurant honestly has the best wings I've ever tasted. If you're going there for the first time I recommend the sweet and hot wings. Their subs are freakin huge!! My friend and I always share a foot long Italian Philly cheese steak together. The restaurant is kept really clean and their service is really friendly. The lady is really nice and always has a smile on her face. I've read other reviews where people complained about her husband being mean but honestly he just unfortunately has a grumpy cat face. I would recommend this place any day!<//Text>< userid>

The only reason I gave it a 2 is because of the taste of the wings and the nice lady who usually works the front. The guy who cooks is extremely rude and abrupt. I asked the price of the French fries and instead he just adds it into the order.also he walked away a few times and cut me off before i can finish ordering. I used to eat there when I was a student at ARC 18 years ago but never again.<//text>

My experience here was terrible.
First off, no restroom, no air conditioning during a heat wave and no ice for your fountain drink. Gave me a child size cup when I ordred a large.
Food was yucky...who puts American cheese on a cheese streak sandwich??  Yuck!! The roll was nasty. Complete wast of time and money. Took two bites and tossed it.

If ya go here better luck to you!

I strongly recommed going anywhere else!<//Review>

< Review>
The cashier GUY still has no smile or any expression on his face. He seems very LONELY.....I have not been there for about 6 months, they definitely change the quality of their meat did not care for it the sandwich fell apart when I opened it it just was very disappointing probably won't go back and I've been going there for years it was my favorite sandwich not anymore.<//Review>

<review>We have an issue with either unavailable menu items, POS equipment not functioning. Arrived today, a Saturday, at 5:45p. Website says they close at 7:30p, yet the guy won't fire up the grill to make hot sandwhiches. Never thought I'd have to plead to spend my money. It'll be a shame to see them go out of business for lack of service.</review><Response>None< /Response>< Rating>

<Text>Ignore Mercedes Morris. I don't know where she was eating, but she wasn't eating here. Either that or she has no taste in food. The owners are friendly, the place is clean, the food is the best. I highly recommend the Railroad sandwich or their wings. I honestly think that Mercedes must be talking about the Granite's off of Manzanita (that place is crap) because I've consumed more than my share of wings here and they are always awesome. Seriously, do yourselves a favor and check this place out, it's not far from the onramp for Business & Interstate 80. If you are more than 2 blocks from that onramp, you are at the wrong Granite's (in more way than one).< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

First time here, SO GOOD. First of all, the crab is huge and packed with meat. The soup is super refreshing, you can also choose the level of spiciness to your liking. I personally think this place tastes better than a lot of the places in Korea that sell the same menus. I can't wait to come try all the other menus in the near future. Highly recommended.
P.S. The staff were super sweet and accommodated our needs very well.</review>

This place was amazing and nothing short of the hype!!! It's very efficient how they do things here. You put your name on a list and order right after that so when you're name is called for your table the food is ready.</Review>

Try seafood pot and soup. All the things was very fresh. And good service.  Some review says it's overpriced but it's cheeper than other place. Because korean seafood pot and another menu are different. You can see it.< /Review>

So disappointing and overpriced. Seafood is not that fresh and the sauce isn't very good. A place like this in Korea would go out of business.< /text>

When i went to eat there yesterday with my family, they service was subpar at best. We had to flag down our server multiple times to recieve service and when we finally got the bill i left a tip that fitted the service we received. The server ran out as we were waiting for our vehicle and said that we had added our tip wrong. Not having my glasses i went ahead and fixed the amount, only to find out from my daughter that the amount i had originally put was correct. She basically scammed me out of 13 more dollars to add to her tip. I called and reported what had happened and now she will recieve no tip. It is the proprietary of the situation , she should not have lied to me and on my fault i should have got my glasses out and doubled checked but we had engagement to run too . I already called my bank to let them know that if they run a larger amount to dispute it, i will pay for what i ate but now NO TIP will be added. I advice that if you are visiting or live here do not come here, they are cheats and want more money  for crap service, I do not advice this place at all.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Steamed Agu, Crab Soup, Soy Sauce Crab, Seasoned Crab Sauce I came and ate it today, but the whole food is so delicious!!! After eating Agu steamed, you must eat fried rice!!!!!! Best recommended!!
If you add sujebi sari to the crab soup, tear the dough directly from the front and put it in! The dough is chewy~ The boss and staff are so friendly and the service is very good ^^ Good eating!!

(Translated by Google) I went to eat with two friends and ordered a lot
We ordered a crab pot, a seafood pancake, and an octopus stew.
The crab pot was ok, but my friend said it was fresh. The seafood pancakes are medium and acceptable.
But the octopus is not good at all, it can't bite at all, and the mouth is sour after eating...

(Original)
跟兩個朋友去吃，點了有點多
我們點了一個螃蟹鍋，一個海鮮煎餅，一個章魚stew。
螃蟹鍋還ok，朋友說還算新鮮。海鮮煎餅中等，還可以接受。
但是章魚就整個不行，根本咬不爛，吃完嘴巴有夠痠...<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Owner and employee ?? Change ... Usually the owner is kind and the staff is less. This seems to have changed. I'm very kind of working .. I don't know if I'm a manager or a boss, but I'd like to come out with my unkindness .. When I ask a question about food, why do I ask that ?.

주인과 종업원?? 체인지..  보통 주인이 친절하고 종업원이 덜한데. 여긴 바뀐것 같다. 일하시는 분은 매우 친절한데.. 매니져인지 사장인진  모르겠지만  불친절함에 수저놓고 나오고 싶은 마음..  음식에대해 질문을 해도 저런걸 왜 물어보냐는 식..ㅠㅠ 이렇게 맛없고 딴 게장은 처음 먹어본다

(Translated by Google) The taste is just unkind of service, and they asked me if they were at the counter or not and gathered in front of them and gave them less tips. I don't know the meaning of the tip. It's been a long time since I came to Los Angeles.

(Original)
맛도 그냥 그냥 서비스 불친절 그리고 카운터인지 뭔지 앞에들 모여서 이야기하고 팁도 적게 줬다고 더 달라고 하는. 팁에 의미를 모르시는건지 참 오랜만에 LA 왔는데 가는집들 마다 매우 불친절함 사는게 힘들고 싫은지.</text>

Do yourself a favor and shop somewhere else. IKEA, Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, or anywhere else but here. Everything, every single item is just way too overpriced. A salt/pepper grinder? $49.99! ONE clear plastic cup made out of the cheapest plastic? $3.99! Whoever priced the merchandise smoked the cheapest stuff on the market and just slapped the price tags randomly on everything. It's a nice store, very nice indeed. But there is no point of wasting 3-4 times the money on stuff you can buy somewhere else!< /review>

<Review>The home décor items you can find at Crate & Barrel fit my style so well. I personally like modern/contemporary items that capture the rustic essence of more antiquated pieces, and I always have excellent luck finding that here.  From kitchenware to art pieces, I can always find something that looks great in my home and doesn’t break the bank<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjWl-ebcva5r0Yfov_2cFroDiI8ZqOx1t6ynQ1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOunMZxB4_vs8xNBlqpDzgehFjCVQLqyDYGR9Ve=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNP6XAi7RxCCZ1qAkgzBShTEAGSXW6LReBA2J8Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXTJNS5ZEPjVNPWW1Nzz1A139PLLPgrWk3UMEw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5io_ocAO0WJjl43XFVKAL0yFiIcl5-v39Nehr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

A friend of mine and his fiancée have a wedding registry here, so I went in to do some shopping. After looking at a few different items they had marked, I finally decided on a very elegant yet modern set of glassware that I thought looked really nice. The associate who helped me was great too, and even cleaned the glassware so it would be in pristine condition when I wrap it up for them!<//Text>

Whenever I want to find something unique for my home, or for someone else's  home if I'm buying it as a gift, I always come to this store. The staff rocks and you can almost always find unique items that you just really don't see in other home decor stores!< /Text>

This store is in/attached to a very busy area. A lot of tourists come here, etc. Make sure you are going the right way on  3rd street go get your pick up order, or then you will have to drive up another mile to turn around and be at the pick up point.
The employee was super helpful, so I really appreciate how quickly he found my order and got it out to me in less than 5 minutes. I would definitely recommend this particular Crate and Barrel!<//Text>

WORST SERVICES EVER!  My family and I were followed around the store like we were criminals! They made it so obvious!
When we took the escalator to the second level we were met by a gentleman, who was so rude and told us that they were close! No, "Sorry ma'am but we are close.".  What we were told is, " YOU CAN'T COME HERE! WE ARE CLOSE!" It was barely 8pm!< /Review>

<Text>Avoid furniture here.  Purchased a "custom" bed.  Less than six months after delivery, it is falling apart and now realizing that they glued on a welt on my headboard and left glue all over it...super sloppy and subpar workmanship.  Customer service is just as bad and a hassle and inconvenience to have to deal with them.  It's like they have no concept of what it's like to be a consumer and having to deal with their mistake.  Wish I had purchased elsewhere.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Poorly trained sales person, indifferent floor supervisor, both processed the wrong color stools in the wrong size.  Store mgr. Mike couldn't find it to apologize until I said -- I haven't heard an apology for this boondoggle.  Promised a call tag on Saturday for their return, to date - none received.  Corporate CandB is no better in their lack of response when I asked to speak with the district manager.  If I wanted this kind of "no-service", I'd have shopped online or worse, at Walmart.<//text>

Did not find any crates, or barrels in my size. But did find a set of inexpensive wine glasses.< /review>

<text>Placed a call to have them check on stock and I was disconnected.  Called back and was put on hold.  Thank you, I'll just order it online and pay shipping, but let me remind you to get your customer service together, or else you will be out of a job soon and online shopping will become the norm.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2b92fc2d303c3:0xe74b468c651564c5<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We just celebrated our wedding with 200 guests this past Sunday and it was fantastic! Could not have gone any better! The venue looked beautiful, the new dance floor was awesome and the tables and everything we asked for was ready as scheduled. There was so much food! And it was all delicious!! The staff was courteous and attentive as well. Sarine was our venue manager through this whole process and was terrific. She kept up with all our requests and made sure everything was communicated to us. She helped keep our stress level down and gave many great suggestions. We had many compliments from our guests about this hidden gem of a venue. If you're planning an event, do yourself a favor and contact Brandview Ballroom (L.A. Banquets) - you won't be sorry!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Verdugo Hills High School Senior Prom
April 6, 2019 turned put to be a great event at an amazing venue. Kudos to all staff members and students who enjoyed the food, the music and the ambience. Nothing more exciting to see everyone dressed up to the nines and enjoying the moment! The ambience was electrifying and everyone in attendance seem to be having a great time. The dance floor was always crowded and the DJ played a very eclectic range of music for everyone. The Mediterranean cuisine was a treat but the dessert bar & snacks we're on pointe!<//text>

Sarine is so amazing at Brandview. She will definitely help elevate your vision and make suggestions to make it better than you envisioned. The staff, from those in the office to the waiters to the bartenders, were absolutely friendly and on point. Everyone provided great service.

The food is amazing and so delicious! I highly recommend them and suggest them to all the brides I know.

If you're considering them for any kind of event, please do. You won't regret it.<//Review>

Brandview Ballroom is a beautiful and modern venue for any event! Their food and service are always on point. The guests are always satisfied and leave the party happy.
I've hosted and attended multiple events here. The staff starting from the event manager,  Sarine, and all the way to the floor manager, Gokor, are all so professional and willing to help. They make the planning process so easy and so much fun.  I would recommend this venue to anyone. You're guest will be wowed and will enjoy your event.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>If you’re looking for a gorgeous, elegant venue, with helpful, responsive people for a special occasion, L.A. Banquets is the place for you. I’ve been planning an event for myself this past year, and each and every meeting I’ve had with them has been so much fun and more exciting. They’re extremely helpful and make you feel like everything is taken care of. Sarine Garabedian, my main consultant, has been the best I could have asked for because she has a positive attitude, is a great people person, and is amazing at her job. She has made planning the event so much easier for me and has been able to offer everything I wanted. The workers have been so welcoming and kind as well, and you can truly tell they want to make your event as perfect as possible and without flaw. So if you want your event to be very special, beautiful, and easy to plan, choose L.A. Banquets!< /Review>< Pics>

It was an absolute hit! We had a wonderful time, surrounded by our amazing family and friends.

We worked closely with Sarine, who did a great job coordinating and managing the entire event. Sarine is extremely friendly, personable and honest - which is such a great combination when planning a wedding. She made sure that all our needs were taken care of.

In addition, the entire staff at LA Banquets is on top of their game! They run the evening extremely well. It was so nice being a bride to not think about the extra/behind the scenes stuff and being able to relax and enjoy the night. The staff took care of everything and were additionally so kind to both my husband and I and our guests!

The location of Brandview is also a huge plus, as it is right in downtown Glendale and kitty corner from the Americana. It is a great place to host traveling guests.

We highly recommend any event at the Brandview Ballroom!<//review><name>Erin Runyan</name><resp>None</resp>< pics>

I had my wedding in March 2018 and everything was beautiful. All our guests raved about the food, the drinks, and the venue. As I write this, I’m thinking about all the other events I can have here or convince others to have here so I can attend. Sarine and the staff were great. Every interaction with them was easy and pleasant. Even though they didn’t have to, they accommodated a vendor of mine who was confused about delivery time on the day of the wedding. I loved that I could pick the layout and especially that we didn’t have to worry about buying alcohol for the reception since we selected the open bar option for our thirsty guests. You definitely get bang for your buck here-we visited a number of other venues and no other place compared in price, food or alcohol.<//Text>

Simple as possible, my daughters XV party;
* Host Sarine, attentive and great communicator. A+
* Location: Safe and a local attraction area with great view and very clean. A+
* Food: Full course meal. Appetizers, Main dishes. A+
* Service: Great attention to guests, food was coming out non stop.A+
* Space: Ginormous. A+
* Full Service Bar: Lives up to the title, Full Service. A+
* Parking: This is the only downside, no free parking unless you find a free space 2+ blocks away, which isn't that bad considering the venue and area. Worth it. You can also pay for parking across the street for $9.00 all night.

We plan on our next even at one of their other locations soon since we loved the experience here!

Thank you Sarine and team!

Was at L.A. Banquets for a wedding and the service and food were spectacular. I’m a close family friend of the brides and she said Sarine and Sevan  was so helpful with planning the wedding. We had a blast!< /Review>

Had wedding there two weeks ago. Such an amazing venue and staff. Would highly recommend to anyone. It was such a pleasure working with sevada and the rest of the staff there. Totally helpful and professional and worked with us and even at times guided us every step of the way. Everyone had such a great time at the wedding and kept asking us how we found such an incredible place like this! Complete gem of a place in the valley!</text>

<text>I'm going to keep this review short & sweet because I already put my long reviews on wedding wire & yelp praising brand view and all of their amazing employees. I had my engagement at Brand view last week! i couldn't be happier with the venue I chose. The people, food and the beauty of the ballroom!! Absolutely amazing and when everything came into play (flowers & decor) my engagement was jaw dropping! Literally, I saw a few young girls looking around and I knew what they were thinking! My fairy tale engagement looked a lot like theirs at that moment! Thank you Brand view!!!!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< gmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Wow! I can't say enough about this wonderful place. First off, the staff really makes you feel like family. Everyone is great and helpful and welcoming especial Sarine and Greg made our special day wonderful. And of course everyone one at the main office. I would look for any excuse to have another party there or if I could relive my Wedding reception all over again I would. Second of all, the food is absolutely tasty especially the salmon. Overall 10/10 Five Stars guarantee for me.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

This place is unbelievable. My brother's wedding party was at this place and the service was amazing. The place is well decorated and beautiful. They have more than enough caterers to serve any size of party. The variety and the quality of the food was great as well. They also have a great valet parking for the convenience of the guests. Over all I had a great time at this place.< /text>

After careful consideration we decided to move forward and reserve Brandview Ballroom for our upcoming wedding. We are so excited to be working with Sarine who was the deciding factor in our decision to have our wedding there. She is warm, knowledgeable and professional. Can’t wait to start the planning.</Review>

LOVE THIS PLACE!!!
I'm a wedding planner. My wedding couple picked Anoush Banquet Hall as their one and only choice! I was beyond pleased with this choice knowing how amazing all the weddings I had attended there was just outstanding and elegant.
The staff is awesome to work with from the first meeting to the final event date, not to mention their customer service is on point!
The wedding went so wonderful!
The staff really know how cater to their guests.< /text>

I decided the second I walked in to the Le Foyer location that it was my dream venue. Booked on the spot and didn't look back.
Everyone from the floor guys to the venue manager made sure my day was perfect. The food was amazing. I was sad to find out we had no leftovers. I would recommend this company to all my friends and family. It's been over a year and everyone is still talking about the venue and food. Thank you guys for making my dream come true.</Text>

I would have rated 5 starts except security kicked me (the bride) off the dance floor for having a glass of water in my hand and would not allow anyone with a drink on the dance floor.  There was also a plumbing issue in the bridal suite.  However, it didn’t affect the reception area.  Otherwise, I had a great experience.  Sevada was great to work with!  He was very professional, informative and quickly responded to any messages.  The bar tenders did fire tricks, were quick to serve and very polite.  The venue is very spacious and elegant – it was amazing!  I would recommend this place to anyone on a budget or wanting to splurge on a fabulous event.<//Review>

I was at a friend's wedding recently at the Glenoaks Hall location. It was an Armenian wedding. I had never been to Armenian wedding. It was an excellent experience.The design was very nice and food was great. They had so many different types of appetizers and brought kabobs and fish later. There was so much food and I wished I could eat more, but I got pretty full within the first hour. Alcohol was plenty as well. The staff were friendly and I tipped our waiter. Overall it was a great banquet hall.<//Review>

I was invited to a wedding event and this place was the venue. I really like this place a lot! The ambiance is really classy and so nice. Very elegant indeed. I really love the designs of the banquet hall, well-decorated and elegant. It's like from a dream or something. As for the food, truly delicious. I even had seconds that time. The service was excellent as well. This was a memorable experience for me.</Review>

My wife and I were searching around for a few different venues for our wedding but we weren't quite sure what we wanted. When we arrived at L.A.

We are still just planning the wedding but we are happy with our selection and can't wait for our January date!

Thank you L.A. Banquets!<//text>

Anoush has been a staple in the Armenian community for as long as I remember. When I got engaged all I knew was I will be having all my wedding events including my reception at one/some of their venues. Luckily they have multiple to choose from and also they cater to offsiteocations. I had my appointment with Linet, she was professional, funny and extremely knowledgeable about not only Anoush but the entire industry. I cannot wait to settle on a date (armenian families take forever to choose a date), reserve it at Brandview and start the planning. From the second I walked in and met with this fantastic team I knew my wedding will be here.</Review>

These guys actually have several banquet halls. My sister had her wedding at the  Glenoaks banquet hall and my own wedding was at the LeFoyer ballroom. Both halls are beautiful with elegant design. The food is excellent. Since are Armenian, the food selection we choose consisted of Armenian and middle eastern selections, but I believe the do offer other options as well.

I also been to their Galleria Lounge. It is a smaller banquet hall for smaller parties, but the design is also elegant here.

The staff have been courteous at all locations and I have no complaints.

They offer valet parking at all locations.<//text>

We are beyond grateful for everything that was done for our kids Christening. We dealt with Haik and Gokor, who were very helpful and made the whole process stress free. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. Thanks to Haik for bringing our vision to life. Overall, we are very satisfied with the services of L.A. Banquets and would definitely go back for future events.</review>

Brandview Ballroom is a great and amazing venue for weddings (and for any types of fun events)!!

Sarine was great to work with throughout the planning process. Very responsive to emails and helpful with all the questions. Even on the day of, all staff was executing the event seamlessly and very professionaly.

Since I am a wedding coordinator, I work at different venues, but the Brandview Ballroom is one of the most enjoyable venues to work with!!!</Text>

I would highly recommend this Venue to anyone. It's modern, clean and very eligant. The Staff is so friendly and will quick to help when needed and answer any questions we may have. Working with Serine and Sevada has been great. They listen to what we want and see our vision. We have gone in there with a list of questions and concerns and when we leave, we leave with every question answered every concerns are put to rest. Trust me they are professional know and do their job very well.    They are quick to respond to any e- mails or voice messages. I can't wait till the big day and I know it will be the best day. Thank you for all that you do guys!</text>

We stopped searching once we met with David and Sevada at Brandview Ballroom over a year before our wedding day. Right away we felt a sense of comfort seeing how organized everyone involved was. Being the organized freak I am, this was a major plus!
From there, we mostly worked with Sevada in further planning our dream day. As the day approached, we also worked with Adam, Christian as well as Greg on the actual big day.
Sevada did everything he could from the beginning to the very end to make sure everything went smoothly and to our liking. I contacted him numerous times via email and telephone with my endless questions as the day approached and I started getting nervous and anxious. He always welcomed my questions and answered them all and made me feel so much better after every conversation that we had. He was very professional and always responded to phone calls and emails on a timely manner. I know how busy it can get during wedding season, so I personally really appreciated the quick responses because it can be difficult at times as a bride running after vendors.
Christian and Adam helped us out a day before the wedding when we went in to hand over a few items for the day of. Christian made sure he made notes of every little detail and everything was delivered exactly on point the next day. And his attitude is a definite plus for a nervous bride!
And of course, Greg, who took care of every little detail the day of the wedding.
The owners definitely know what they are doing here. Everything is thought about before hand. I honestly had prepared myself for things that may go wrong because everyone told me it's impossible for things to go perfectly. Boy were they wrong!! Not only was everything perfect, it was beyond anything we could have imagined.
Thank you to everyone involved for making our special day even more special and as stress free as possible. We truly appreciate every little effort and can't wait to recommend this venue to our family and friends and have future events here soon!< /text>< Rating>

< Review>
L.A. Banquet - Brandview Ballroom – Celestina & William Wedding Sept. 5th, 2014.

Before I get into the reviews I want to give a Gigantic THANK YOU!!!!, to the LA Banquets and Anoush Catering staff.  My wife and I cannot stop talking about this unforgettable day not because the venue was awesome but because of the Anoush Catering staff.   Adam, Greg, Norik, Christian and Vrej fully comprehend that at the core of rendering service are people and relationships. They were welcoming and open to making our dream wedding come to pass and worked with us throughout the entire process. Their genuine interest and care showed at the wedding, we had no complaints from our guests.

We selected the Brandview Ballroom on Valentine’s Day 2014. We were looking for a venue that  had character, great locations, easy parking, great hotels, lots of wedding experience and able to handle 250+ guests. By the way our guest list ended up growing to 430 and this was no sweat for Norik or Greg.  What was important to us was that our guests had more than enough food, were well treated and celebrated our marriage in an awesome atmosphere.  Brandview Ballroom and Anoush Catering hit it out the park!!!!

The venue was clean and had a royal feel to it with the spiral staircase and chandelier.  There was plenty of parking and the valet parking service is next to the entrance.  They provided great valet service, all valet attendants had clean uniforms and polished shoes.  This space had a renovated patio and was more than big enough to accommodate guest sign in.  The lighting was great, the space allowed the music to be heard and also the guests did not have to yell to be heard.

My wife and I do not drink but we heard nothing but great things from those who were at the bar.  They made our choice drinks and we wished they had brought it to our tables because the one we tasted was just just perfect.

Anoush Catering also worked and accommodated all of our vendors and treated them with respect and consistently offered their support to our vendors to make their work easy.  They made sure the venue was open with enough time for the DJ, the florist, the bakery to deliver their service with excellence.  When we walked into the venue everything we discussed and wanted was there.  I am anal at times and even with everything going on I went through my check list and nothing was missing.

They even allowed us to keep stuff there until the next day because we had so many gifts.  They allowed us to take all of the food that was left over.

Above all things my wife was very happy with her wedding and she did not want the night to end.  We were the last ones to leave and we savor all the great moments and awesome time.  Happy wife makes a happy husband.

Although the lighting was great we wanted all the lights dim except for the dance floor light when we were having our speeches and that did not happen but it was okay.

Much appreciation and thanks to L.A. Banquet and Anoush Catering.  Five star all the way around.!!!!!!</Review>

Bad attitude from the waiters and worst management especially how they treat the vendors.
The manager also said he prefers not to work with any Arabs.... especially Jordanians!!!</Text>

<Review>This place has been around for a long time and very much a local favorite. Experienced the bar for a bit while we waited for our table and boy was it busy. All I can say is know what you want and make it quick, these bartenders are busy. As for the food, it was freshly made, but left a lot to be desired in the flavor category. Overall not a bad place just a bit too pricy.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6buvKJaRrXOKGYVQ4S9rV6Nr4mJUP_aPGQhSz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOh8b5lMMHe4gWcvVwVLqJf4UESRKTDhO5XnL0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9_hSynWJeY8lUPJO_WMtScUJjARj_mzsOHOPA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEeIKRYl4iyRLw-75CeE6_pPEf0pEz_K1ZJQvN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqC8X30yF6zJon4IgQ61GkB43KhvLZYTE1UyZn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNl62Pf3bocZu_esU83wTTl_kxEXPv_xORLwUeK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIYF60pwpINTcoE4Rz8cONB1A94Pkl_4N1IStZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Nice restaurant with an awesome view.

The seafood was cooked well. The crab chowder was good. The mussels and shrimp hot skillet was tasty. The garlic butter was strong, so use sparingly. The Basa with the spicy tomato sauce was excellent. I really enjoyed it. The Bass in lemon sauce is what you'd expect for simple flavors. All fish was cooked very well and not dry or overdone. The salted vanilla crunch cake was great!!

Overall, very enjoyable experience. Next time, I'd like to try crab and Cioppionlito.<//Text>< Pics>

In the mod for crab this is the place to come. Recommend making reservations great outdoor seating perfect during COVID restrictions. Food is delicious and service was great! Price is reasonable for the views and quality of food!</Review>

<Review>A nice restaurant with nice views. The food was fresh and tasty. However, I asked for the Crab Enchiladas minus Green Onions and that didn't happen. Also the Crab Alfredo was only crab sauce,  no crab meat in the Alfredo sauce. The iced tea was served from a small glass bottle with enough for 2.5 servings. We had a nice Friday evening at Salito's.< /Review>< Pics>

A great experience all around. From the view, to the food, to the service. Right up against the water with a great view. The food was fantastic, I got the shrimp cocktail and the crab melt. I wish there was more custom sauce for the shrimp cocktail because it was so good. Shared the grilled shrimp and the oysters. Want a huge fan of the mignonette was looking for it to be more vinegary but was still good. Looking forward to going back to try different menu items.<//Review>

I had the filet which was melt in your mouth tender It came with little potatoes baked crisp and full of flavor. The views , area , and atmosphere were wonderful. If your new to the area then I would recommend this beautiful place.  Bring plenty of plastic , its not cheep , but comparatively speeking similarly priced to other establishments of this caliber.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>The food was cool and our waiter was very disconnected, and lacked presence. He kept telling us our individual request (e.g. can we get the chicken grilled instead of fried) could not be met because, "the kitchen is busy right now." However, with all that being said, Jasmine (I believe she was the manager and if she isn't she sure should be) is the sole reason I'm giving this place a 5 star. She was absolutely amazing and extremely accommodating.</Text>< pics>

The food was amazing!! I had the filet mignon and it was like butter!! Seasoned perfectly and so, so tender. Shrimp and crab Louie Louie was delicious, as was the clam chowder and hubby loved the crab enchiladas. It was a beautiful day to be sitting right next to the water. Definitely going back soon.< /Text>

<Review>I would definitely recommend buying the giant loaf of bread and butter. It's tasty on its own, but even better to use for dipping in soup and soaking up leftover sauce. The seafood pastas are deceptively generous, and delicious. The oysters were also good, and it's nice to be able to order 1 or more than 1!< /Review></record>

Overcooked prime rib, rubbery shrimps, ok chowder. Garlic butter was good, mussels were very good. Cheese bread was average. I can see why it's 3.5 on Yelp. As everyone said, nice seating area with the view of the harbor.< /Review>

<Review>Wonderful service. Lovely fun decor. Heat lamps to keep you warm. Casual family restaurant vibe with amazing seafood and salads. Also set up well for date night or birthday celebrations. We had both at neighboring tables. I cant wait to go back. Oh, and how could I forget to mention the spectacular view?! Fish jumped and a seals swam around right in front of us. Waitress said sometimes they get jelly fish too. Casual or semi formal vacation attire both would be ok here.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWlq0lzMpLODQv6NTZ4tgziIqD2nYAKiDyHYHF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO20EZQInztM7a8EX1d5VzLY6H-qog10SsCbgky=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWZx7Oa9iRhOvny5vbqzRv8J_9HD-_ntzd5hUu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNCc6p99NApriUfefO39kkhOK_uux9wD9nxOtQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD5-dxcatmm-kLvcC0sIo8cswFJ8msnCAFWqbG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGfojZz6pj8zE9e2VBnoQcfWuoRCCp4WYngQjZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFeknzG-EqZaZ-aPvsKgSjbHu0zbhYJI0iEpgV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaHdDH0edVSDuLptPhwbMc3MqURvvqqBRxElaD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFwSEpF16tZpmm1qfKVfWb-aRoW12C_BVzQKjR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNigzUdnUCOESEk_Wb6qbeDGJrO_UV6tGDffy8Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqoLKPzTTLqugoLHEkKOZcafLyJq6dxvhp2tQK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfqUHw905Eomx8WSNjRGkmZ1-daF5QE_6DtYtM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOb2WK91h2GKLEEZ-qOzLTa5ppvVR8z9AacFCaM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjwlxtgS8xPQdDNGFD9X3oyUbedV9m8koXajRV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEXoGEs3idXE5ai22Z6iUg02kkOIUhKQ7GYW_r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

They seemed sort nice but ended up Prime rib was grey tough my tasteless & potato (few seafood) Choppino was terrible No seafood worth mentioning & seemed recooked with tomato paste added.  Crab my hubby tried was ok but missing claws & grey inside of the meat!  Now we saw on internet that this place was great but I do Not like that the waiter comes out with old desserts & we could not pick the dessert at 1st until after my hubby ordered what he wanted.  but of course we should have left but someone's eyes were looking for the dessert which was old & tasteless.  Never we will go there again.  Instead we go home & eat 5 star our local Italian place which we love.    Sorry for the next patrons Beware😣 of spoiled crab, Seafoods & less than 4 star Prime rib.  Your safer ordering salad & appetizers.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
We went to Saulito’s for my Husband’s 40th Birthday dinner in a Tuesday. The ambiance is casual, I felt somewhat overdressed, but I do that. Anyway, the table was right by the window which was about a foot off of the Bay. And with the windows open it was like we were on a boat. Sensational! The best part of our night, other than the love that is sharing family time was Jasmine! When I was looking like a crazy woman, sneaking the dessert menu she picked up on it in the most gracious way. She asked what my vision was and brought it to life. Thank you, Jasmine! You made our birthday dinner a celebration, and I cannot thank you enough for the royal treatment! It was everything a 40th birthday should be!

Why not 5 stars? I don’t speak Español, so communication with our server was frustrated. My suggestion would be, if there are patrons that only speak English to provide them with a server who is fluent in English. And, if patrons speak Español, provide them with servers who speak Español.

Food was tasty, mussels were roasted and I prefer mine steamed in a nice fennel white wine broth. Lol. I have a preference. However, the Man of the Hour enjoyed his crab thoroughly.< /review>

I watched two of the waiters debating on who was going to serve my table, I think it might have to do with the color of my skin.😟

Fresh seafood. Don't listen to the nay sayers. These guys know how to throw a steaming hot platter of mussels and shrimp in your face like you weren't expecting it!</Review>

4+, the crab was so fresh. The crab enchiladas were the best! The bread was yum. The atmosphere being right on the water was beautiful, casual, but upscale too. Our server, Aneal, was spot on! Definitely will eat here again and recommend.  Thank you for a great experience.         By Kristen from Colorado<//Review>

We've been going to Salitos every time we have any occasion (birthday, anniversary and so on). But our last time yesterday was terrible. Our reservation was for 6.15pm, but had to wait for 30 more minutes to get seated. We ordered crab pasta, home salad with shrimps and cioppino. Everything was mediocre except for pasta- we liked it. Right away when we finished our dinner, I felt terrible and sick. By now I've been laying down for a second day because of food poisoning. I think the problem was with raw shrimps that were in our salad (although we hadn't been told that  the "add shrimps" to the salad option means the shrimps will be raw as we usually try to avoid unprocessed food). It was definitely our last time that we went to Salitos!</Text>

<review>You pay for the view but the food's good to.

The food was goof, but the portions were on the smaller side for what you pay for them. But the view is fantastic and staff are nice. I probably won't be a regular, but I'm glad I got to enjoy the scenery.<//review><UserId.>103709371443410284193</UserId.>< rate>

We come here a couple of times a year, the food is fantastic!  Getting in, even with a reservation is difficult on holidays.  I recommend coming before 12 or after 2pm.  Or late afternoon, the views are beautiful.</Review>

Amazing space and experience. Staff was really nice and we enjoyed all the food.

<Review>We loved its iron skillet combo. It’s reasonably priced and tasted great! The restaurant is also by water and close to downtown area. Highly recommended for those visit Sausalito!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808584516e36f9b9:0xd062e5c18afb1242< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Hey, It's open and that's a good thing by itself! The food is good, but I wouldn't say great. Service is hit and miss and depends upon staffing. Great patio area and on the Richardson Bay so the views are really nice to just hang out. I would say the appeal is great for the older folks. Not the kind of place younger people in their 20's, 30's or 40's hang out at. The pricing is on the higher side for the drinks & food you get. So, be ready for a hefty bill.<//Text><Date>1600891824002<//Date></record>

<Text>Nice place to take a company or date. Or just plain treatin' yoself. This place probably has the fanciest and greater fish n chips I've ever had. I was expecting some fried fish with a golden color without any seasoning, but this one definitely surprised me.

However, the sandwiches are definitely not their specialty. My friends who had them were okay with it, but wasn't fully satisfied. The calamari were delicious as well as their oysters.

I'd go here again if I'm in the area or want to take someone out. Great views and service.< /Text>< name>

Absolutely delicious; some of the best seafood we've ever had. A little expensive but totally worth it. We got the crab cakes, fish & chips, and sand daps with lemon butter caper sauce. Portions were large and everything was delicious. The location and view are perfect, service was fast and friendly. Unfortunately we live on the east coast or we would go back every week.< /Text>

Great menu and beautiful view over the water. The steak or prime rib with half a crab is quite the experience. I can definitely recommend that if you're hungry. The crab cakes and various fish dishes are great as well. I have not been disappointed by any of their dishes. The patio and the outside bar in the back are perfect for a lazy afternoon in the sun.</Text>

Great menu and beautiful view over the water. The steak or prime rib with half a crab is quite the experience. I can definitely recommend that if you're hungry. The crab cakes and various fish dishes are great as well. I have not been disappointed by any of their dishes. The patio and the outside bar in the back are perfect for a lazy afternoon in the sun.</review>

Great view. Always asked to be seated outside even if the wait is longer. Try anything with crabs in it and it will be delicious. Staff is super efficient and courteous<//Review>

<text>Food was OK. Service was awful. Waiter brought the wrong pasta to our table. When we informed him, he said it's more expensive than our pasta order and he wouldn't charge us extra. We politely declined as we really wanted to try the other pasta. He completely forgot the order. When staff came to clear dishes, we informed him we were waiting for pasta order. He left. No follow up. After we cancelled pasta since waiter forgot it, we asked for a box for the remaining food. Busperson gets mad and said "oh my God", grudgingly bringing a box. Ruined our dining experience.</text>< Pictures>

Nice place with a view. Need reservations. Go there for the crab and fish. Enchiladas are best at Mexican places. The watermelon mojito was pretty good though.< /review>

Salito's Crab House is fantastic! We stopped in for lunch while in Sausalito and sat near the open back room with a great view of the boats! The fish sandwich and the fish & chips are massive and take up the whole plate. The portions are huge, and the wait staff is very friendly, quick, and do a great job of checking on you throughout your meal. The area is super busy and parking is a bit sparse. They have their own parking lot but it fills up quickly, your best bet is to find paid street parking. Next time I'm in town, I'm going to stop in again.< /text>

<text>Enjoyed my steak dinner there with a mate. Good view of Sausalito bay if you can get a seat by the edge. They wouldn't cook less than medium rare and I like a bit of blood. That said the meat was really good, soft and tender except that it was about 25% unrendered fat, some people like it that way, the other person at the table ate it all up. The service was fine. It's more than I like to pay for a steak dinner but the pricing fits the local area which is generally expensive.< /text>< UserId.>

< review>
Filet mignon was the best I’ve ever had. Service was good but we arrived early and there were few people around to gauge how they respond during busy time. Regardless, staff was friendly and attentive. The crab was a little dry but the flavor was amazing. Vegetables were sooo good sitting in the filet drippings and soaking up the flavor. The meal was a bit pricey but honestly was worth the money for the meal. Wife had the fish and chips which were also amazingly good. The breading was flavorful and crispy and the potatolings were spot on.
I highly recommend this spot for food.<//review>

On a weekend get-away, compared to the extremely over-crowded places nearby (2hr+ waits), this place had great service and seats with a great view within 5-10 minutes.

The crab is incredibly tasty with a (admittedly strong) buttery garlic sauce that goes well with bread (99c for some hot fresh bread to go with). We also had some cheap wine to go with, reasonably fast service. We spent around 2 hours just enjoying our meal and drinks with the view here, relaxed atmosphere.

I think if we'd ordered some of the single-person meals the quality of the food may not have been as good, this definitely is a seafood-first sort of place, the mussels and crabs are what they specialize in, so I can see why the other food may not be as tasty.<//text>

<text>This is a great place for crab and prime rib. The cheese and bread appetizer was also great. My wife loves crab and said it was the best she's had. The prime rib was tender and flavorful. The restaurant also had a view of the water and we could see otters playing. We will visit again!<//text>< pictures>

This is truly 5 star dining. The ambiance, food, service, and entire experience was amazing.  The fish comes at a cost, but it's so fresh and delicious,  it's worth it.</Text>

Crab bisque in a bread bowl is huge, perfect for a chilly day looking over the bay, and the bread is the highlight of an already fantastic bowl of bisque. Mussels are amazing here - fresh, perfectly cooked, great flavors. The mussel sizes truly are for sharing, so watch out and order smaller. Seafood linguine was the standout of the meal though. The ratio of seafood to linguine was outrageous. Piles of perfectly cooked seafood hid the bits of slightly aldente linguine, with a sauce that tied the whole plate together. I am a seafoodaholic and I needed a break from seafood after this meal. It was damn near perfect, and so much of it. On a side note, the desserts were nothing to slouch at either. They are all excellent, so whatever floats your boat. And, of course, it's hard to beat the atmosphere - Sausalito, in the water, outside. What more could you want?< /Text><rate>5< /rate>< Gmap_id>

I ordered the catch of the day (salmon with lemon and caper sauce). The Salmon was cooked well and tasted nice. the potatoes were delicious as well. The corn, and (honestly I dont know what it was) little... ball things? werent that great.

My girlfriend ordered the spicy seafood pasta and it was delicious.

The view was amazing as well.< /review>

Nice place to take a company or date. Or just plain treatin' yoself. This place probably has the fanciest and greater fish n chips I've ever had. I was expecting some fried fish with a golden color without any seasoning, but this one definitely surprised me.

However, the sandwiches are definitely not their specialty. My friends who had them were okay with it, but wasn't fully satisfied. The calamari were delicious as well as their oysters.

I'd go here again if I'm in the area or want to take someone out. Great views and service.<//text>

Great spot for the view of the waterfront.< /text>< pics>

You pay for the view but the food's good to.

The food was goof, but the portions were on the smaller side for what you pay for them. But the view is fantastic and staff are nice. I probably won't be a regular, but I'm glad I got to enjoy the scenery.<//Review>

<Review>I wish I could give more stars. After checking in we got seated  only in 1 hour despite having a reservation(!). We were staying with 2 kids (on of them a 8-mo old baby) on the street without any shade. It took me a lot of efforts finally to get seated. Food was ok. Too much salt in the garlic sauce. Also my child got expired soda. I would not recommend this place to anyone.</Review>< pictures>

Bringing the rating to 5, last time we had a super delicious lunch. I had a fillet mignon, which was very good, juicy and tender. My wife had a salad, which was good too.
The place is a bit pricey, but that is OK for such a wonderful location.< /review>

The thing to do here is order a crab dish - while the waiter recommended the crab entree, we opted for the crab enchiladas and the mixed fried seafood. Excellent food- especially the enchiladas! The patio is beautiful, looking over the water.</review>

< Review>
I came here for dinner the other night with my man and all I have to say is WOWWWW. Everything about the food and experience was just out of this world. We made reservations, got there early and ordered cocktails while we waited which I loved (plus the cocktails were strong and BOMB). At the table we ordered the cast iron bread and brussel sprouts to start--  the bread and butter was so real and fresh like they made it to order! And the brussel sprouts were crispy and so well-seasoned. The seating layout outside was nice and the sunset was so dreamy!! We ordered pasta and steak, and got a good suggestion for wine and every single bite was just PERFECT. And everything was well-priced. Our server [Megan] just took the experience over the top with her positive attitude and expertise on the restaurant and city. And she treated surrounding tables with the same care so you know it's real. Lol I was so sad to leave and cannot WAIT to come back and get a table right at the rails. This is seriously my new favorite place with the best memories. 😊

I'd say the only thing that made this restaurant feel less than of its caliber is the fact that the host was wearing a shirt that was a little short or not fitted well, so you could see her stomach and love handles-- which significantly decreases professionalism anywhere.< /Review>

Excellent food! People were lined up outside for Sunday brunch. Great that it was BYOW, we brought champagne and ordered orange juice for mimosas! Crabwich was yummy along with crab crowder. Inside and outside seating, full bar, can't go wrong! You must visit!< /Text>

Stopped in to Salito's while shopping in Sausalito one afternoon on vacation. Best thing I did the whole trip. The mussels were excellent and priced about $20 for 2 dozen. Who can beat that ... plus the butter, parmesan, garlic dipping sauce put about 5 pounds on but was so worth it. Good wine prices also. And the service was great. We just walked in and were seated on the water. Another day in another town I was bragging on how good it was and they said they had heard of it but thought you needed reservations and there was a waiting list. Maybe for dinner but wasn't so in early weekday afternoon.</text>

My personal dish was not my favorite, but the service was great and the food was overall fun and inventive! We got the crabwich, crab alfredo, and two orders of crab enchiladas. If you like Cioppino you will like the enchiladas. The sandwich was light and yummy (not full of mayo like most crab sandwiches) and the Alfredo was very delicious. We also got a liter draft beer (only 9.99) so we had a great time. The back area is amazing on a sunny day because it is open to  the waterfront view, try to get a seat there!</Review>

<review>Great view, good food and good drinks. Came to a work event celebrating a colleague's career change. Didn't feel stuffy, the staff was attentive in an out of the way style which allowed everyone to mingle about and enjoy the celebration. The bartender made a good negroni, the beer selection was decently good. The appetizers were delicious and set out nicely for everyone to help themselves.<//review></record>

<review>My personal dish was not my favorite, but the service was great and the food was overall fun and inventive! We got the crabwich, crab alfredo, and two orders of crab enchiladas. If you like Cioppino you will like the enchiladas. The sandwich was light and yummy (not full of mayo like most crab sandwiches) and the Alfredo was very delicious. We also got a liter draft beer (only 9.99) so we had a great time. The back area is amazing on a sunny day because it is open to  the waterfront view, try to get a seat there!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5HubAZ5Nw8TUJN79oCbxxvJIxPNWB9Y5PTSlf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1527612451775, 'text': "Thank you for the fantastic rating, Shannell!\n\nWe're delighted to hear you enjoyed your meal with us!

This was a game time decision. The family was out sightseeing a d we were afraid that they would not look to kindly on our attire,  but we gave it a try. The staff was friendly and helpful. The decor was cool, light and airy with an Americana tin toy motif. The food was delicious!  We got a pasta, a salad, a sandwich, and an enchilada. They were all amazing. Try the Potatolitos. The waiter (James-I believe) was super and professional. Wish we lived closer, we'd return regularly.</Review>

My cohort from school and I tried to meet up at Bar Bocce.  That place was ridiculous and not helpful at all.  We walked next door and had the bar area to ourselves. This place is delicious with a view.  Let me tell you - did NOT disappoint.  The staff was great and the drinks selection on point.  The bar area is beautiful and I've been back twice sense!  I love this place and look forward to coming back.  Keep up the great work to the team there.</review>

<Text>The menu is great for both surf and turf. Helpful staff who actually know the menu and what might suit what you're looking for. I had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich, my wife had the seafood stew and my mum-in-law had the sea bass. All three dishes were delicious, but the seafood stew and the ketyle bread was the best of the three. My wife loved the virgin mojito. Great seating inside and out and excellent facilities for wheelchairs. A great place to eat or just to drink and chat.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNc6aKWl2itakg_4raCpQcb7R1w4KdV5vNs-P7u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHPGZQDOnAvORUpAPJ-zKTsDXysSJzW1hovdKs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>{'time': 1538768326515, 'text': "Thanks for the amazing review, Jay!\n\nWe're thrilled to hear that you had a great dining experience with us!

<review>This place is awesome! Waterfront, great service, great food, great location.

I recommend to try a little bit of everything here, they have many plates with combined seafood.

I can't remember if it was pricey, but I definitely know it is worth it for a quick bite on my way to Bay Area.

This part of California is beautiful, should definitely pay a visit. I know I'll be back to this restaurant soon.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Great food. Great service. Holy hell is that outside patio hot in the winter time! Those patio heaters have no issues at all. That was my only issue just because I already had winter clothes on and was not willing to strip in front of strangers. Maybe having every other one on could keep the area warm without it being too hot. Then again, I do run hotter than most people. Anywho, the servers were great. Friendly and kind and well knowledged with the menu and different options. Next time we're near by, we'll probably end up here again. Thank you!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My family and I discovered this restaurant on Thanksgiving day 2019 while visiting my son.  We had no reservation and it was one of a few places open on Thanksgiving Day.

My first time here. Food was delicious didn't care to much for the butter mix they serve with the crab. But the server replaced it with just regular butter for me thank you!

I absolutely love this place. If you don't like crab or prime rib, it might not be the best place for you. But if you do, do yourself a favor and stop here next time you are in Sausalito. We get the crab plates and some sides with a bottle of wine, and we sit in the open air year-round. For my mother-in-law's birthday, they treated us to fresh beignets and they were delicious! The service is top-notch!</Text>

This is the place I go to hang out with my two best friends - we love it so much. Not that we do not experiment with other restaurants, but nothing can beat Salito’s lovely ambience. First of all, it looks clean, friendly and relaxing. As soon as you sit down you will be charmed with nice decor,  beautiful views and coziness of the place.  The food is great and you can’t believe- the corking is free!  They have a good choice of vines,  but if you have something special to share with friends- bring it with you! The waiters are always smiling and helpful and you can tell they like what they are doing. For all the years we go to Salito’s we never had any unpleasant experiences there.  Just one great place to spend a lovely evening with your friends or family. We’ve been the just on Sunday and were happy to see lots of other Europeans around - such a pleasure to be among nicely dressed people with great table manners 😜👍< /review>

Nice place to have some drinks on the go if walking around the town. Menu is not such interesting with fine or exclusive options but just right if you are hungry. Not overcrowded and has beautiful bay view.< /Text>

Ate here for Mother's Day dinner.  I usually order the crab enchilada which is huge!  I ordered the prix fixe menu crab legs while my son had the prime rib.  Views were awesome...  it was just a wee bit chilly on the patio as the heaters took a while to warm up and the restaurant took a while to extend the awning to retain the heat.  My son said he was cold as he was furthest from the heaters.  Neighboring table gentleman seemed to feel the cold as well...  so dress in layers and have a great meal!< /Text>

Best crab my family has ever had! And I loved the prime rib - lite cut was perfect for me (I have a very small appetite). Get the whole crab and the amazing bread and a seat on the patio and you’ll have a great afternoon. Such a good find!<//text>

< review>
This restaurant has a great location and view. The food is reasonably priced and pretty good. We had the crab enchiladas and mussels. The mussels first came out quite burnt (charred and black), but this was remedied really quickly. When prepared well, the mussels are tasty. The crab enchiladas were good but nothing to brag about. Overall we were pleased but expected more from a place with such high reviews.</review>

Great location. Great service!  Our food came out so fast it was shocking!  Our waiter was extra. The food was very good. I’m not sure what’s up with the prices, though. It’s recorded as only $$ and everyone says it’s reasonably priced but it was rather expensive. Maybe I’m just not acclimated to California prices yet.   Definitely $$$.<//Review>

We had a group of 6 adults and 2 kids. 4 stars was the average for adults. I thought that was fair. I would have given it 2 stars. I got the crab sandwich and the crab chowder. the chowder was lacking flavor and cold. the sandwich was ok. One person in our group had the crab cakes and she said they were awesome.<//text>

Although our Caesar salad was good, the bread wasn’t included. Crab and steak was a great material, cooking was not as expected (only of those two meals, dessert and caesar salad were great), however.

The crab is delicious and the service is terrible. I had to ask to be sat outside that we could view the water, when there were multiple open tables. We were then ignored by the hostess and multiple waitstaff for 20 minutes before we were even able to get a glass of water. At one point, the hostess told a waiter that were hadn’t been acknowledged yet and she shrugged her shoulders. The waiter who finally took our order did just that. He took the order and never came back. I would not recommend this establishment.< /review>

Really good food. The menu seems boring, but there is a lot of uniqueness in the way things are done, and the food is very good. Big portions too. Great service, great atmosphere. Fun atmosphere, just a bit noisy. Wonderful view of the bay.</text>

Great atmosphere, good food and a waterfront view.
Came to this restaurant with a few friends for lunch and had a great time.  The food was pretty good as well as the service.  After lunch we went for a stroll in the waterfront which is right next to the restaurant.</review>

<text>OK decent food, nice waitress but very little service. Also very cold on patio and not very accommodating in trying to get a better spot even though we made reservations the night b4 and had 2 daughters in dresses freezing. Also open tables everywhere (staff was worried we would be in a different server's section, which should be sorted out without involving the customer). Overall I would skip it for a nicer atmosphere given the amount you pay for dinner and lack of service. Sausalito is however a beautiful place. Worth checking out.</text>< Pics>

Ambience is wonderful.  Parking was a nightmare.  Brussel sprout appetizer was very good.  The main course was a large portion, but served cold and a little greasy.  Auto correct won't let me name it, but it was breaded and fried seafood with cooked vegetables.  The corn on the cob pieces were dry, tasteless and cold.  The sweet potatoes pieces wete good, but again cold.</Review>

Great food, big portions and great views. The limoncello cake was out of this world delicious. The decorations are cute, there are big tables that sit 12 people were everyone sees each other easily, not those long tables where you can only talk to people next to you. A mandatory stop if you go to Sausalito.</text>

Made a reservation through OpenTable. Arrived 15 minutes prior to reservation to be told there would be a wait. We waited an hour past our reservation time and were finally seated. The poor young girl that was the hostess didn't seem to be a seasoned hostess. She had a list of reservations, our name was not put on that list she kept showing I'm assuming the manager, ours name was written in crayon on a different list. Anyways, we were still better off than some people that came in with/before us. When we were seated, our waitress was very nice, said she would be right with us, but that it would probably be 5-10 minutes, fine, at least she warned us. It was her second day on the job and it was a busy night, I think she did well considering. She was very kind and did her best. We ordered an appetizer and our food at the same time and they were both out at almost the same time and within 10 minutes. Once we actually got to the food it was great. The kettle bread and cheese was phenomenal, I think it would have been just as good without the cheese. I could have took bread home for later it was that good. I had the spicy shrimp pasta, it was delicious and while it didn't look like a big portion for the price, it was filling. My friend had the roasted shrimp, she said it was good, just a little cumbersome to have to peel it all before eating it. Food was five star, service has some work to do (mostly on on the seating portion). The food was some of the best on our trip, I would return, just maybe later in the evening (after 8:30) or earlier in the evening (4:30 or 5).<//Text>

I had an excellent evening at Solito's yesterday. The vibe, venue, waterfront views, staff friendliness, and food were great. Barry White was even laying out his soul music in the background. It's definitely a comfortable scene. I highly recommend the brussel sprouts and kettle bread. My crabcakes were alright, and could have benefited by that special crab cake foodie touch of the eastern shore of Maryland or Delaware. While eating, I couldn't stop thinking of the crab cakes at Matt's Fish Camp, Lewes, DE of a few weeks ago. A wider selection of craft beers on tap would be nice, too. Overall, a solid positive experience, and I'll be back.</review>

One of the best places to eat in all of Marin. Very friendly and promptly service. Excellent food. No corkage fee... so we bring our own bottle and it saves a lot of $$.  Amazing views of Richardson Bay.  One of our favorites places to eat!

Update - We eat here about once a week and we are never disappointed.  Just had brunch today for the first time... 5 stars again for food quality, ambiance and service.  Great job staff!</Text>

<Review>A great place to watch the world go by as you enjoy some of the best seafood and ribs served by some of the friendliest people. I loved the Chorizo and Cheese bread as a starter - although I would share as the portion size was massive.  The chowder in a bread basket is a staple of the bay area and was a great treat as I watched the sun go down over the marina. A great place to stop if you are in the area or are doing the bike the bridge, boat back to San Francisco tour.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This is the best place for crab in all California. Food is great and view even better. Stay longer and see the tide. Staff is always happy and willing to help.<//Review>

<user_name>Erin Rhodes</user_name><Review>Confirming all the other reviews that this was excellent and fast service with a beautiful view! The crab and seafood fettuccini were delicious! Highly recommend Salito's!

My aunt's and I were visiting from the east coast and just saw this had good reviews.  Other restaurants were crowded,  here there was no wait. The service was fast and excellent.  The bus boys were very attentive and quickly cleared dishes as needed. The server brought out the sauce to try to check how spicy it was. Everyone was so welcoming and friendly.  The manager had even stopped to ask how things were.  The view was beautiful and the deck was warm even in the evening.  Absolutely wonderful!</Review>< userid>

Ambiance is great. You are on the water and the open layout makes every table feel outside even if you are sitting inside. Food was good especially the crab cakes and crab chowder. Stay away from the salad, it had old lettuce and was just not very good. Chowder could have had more crab but was very tasty. Didn't try it but the Dungeness crab entree looked fantastic.<//review>

A pleasant restaurant by the oceanfront in the city of Sausalito, across Bay from San Francisco by Ferry.  The seafood Fettuccini was fantastic, which was perfectly matched by a glass of Resling. Not in the most popular part of the town but it is a good choice with seafront setting and ocean breezes.</text>

A great place to watch the world go by as you enjoy some of the best seafood and ribs served by some of the friendliest people. I loved the Chorizo and Cheese bread as a starter - although I would share as the portion size was massive.  The chowder in a bread basket is a staple of the bay area and was a great treat as I watched the sun go down over the marina. A great place to stop if you are in the area or are doing the bike the bridge, boat back to San Francisco tour.< /Review>

I had an excellent evening at Solito's yesterday. The vibe, venue, waterfront views, staff friendliness, and food were great. Barry White was even laying out his soul music in the background. It's definitely a comfortable scene. I highly recommend the brussel sprouts and kettle bread. My crabcakes were alright, and could have benefited by that special crab cake foodie touch of the eastern shore of Maryland or Delaware. While eating, I couldn't stop thinking of the crab cakes at Matt's Fish Camp, Lewes, DE of a few weeks ago. A wider selection of craft beers on tap would be nice, too. Overall, a solid positive experience, and I'll be back.</Text>

Quite posh. Good service though. The barmaid was very chatty and welcoming. It's the views you come here for though. One wall opens out onto the bay. Just beautiful.</Text>

Visitor Center's staff recommended this restaurant and it was a great choice. The wait was not very long even though it was very busy due to long weekend. The food was great . I ordered the Sea Bass from the Fisherman's catch section and it was fantastic. Service was pretty decent and quick.</text>

Great place for a last minute bite... I’ve been here twice on such last minute dinner decisions to walk into nearly an empty place. The staff are awesome and outside deck is well equipped with heaters which gives you comfort while relishing in the GREAT views on the water. I’m not too impressed with the food itself and finally found a dessert that I do like (the beignets). This is not an upscale star 5 food quality but definitely a quick bite to eat with some great service and atmosphere.<//text>

I had a hamburger at a crab place because i hate crab/fish... which was ok, nothing special. My wife had the fish and chips and while presented in a unique fashion, also nothing to write home (or on Google) about.  Good food, not great and for the prices should be better. View as very nice!</Review>

The Salito Crab House & Prime rib is on the water the view is amazing where ever you sit. The snacks were delightful we ate calamari, crab cakes and cheese bread. Recommend trying everything all patrons looked happy and satisfied. Our waiter was excellent and the other staff were walking by picking plates so fast. I will come back.</review>

Okay food, way over priced for the garlic noodles I got. Noodles tasted like Ramen. Shrimp was all shelled. Worst of all of waiter was extremely rude. I honestly felt like I was a bother to him, he literally made eye contact with us like twice. My boyfriend really enjoyed his food but doesn't like the service either. The couple next to us had the same waiter and he was completely different with them. Only plus was it is a beautiful restaurant with a great view.<//review>

After spending the morning kayaking on the water, we enjoyed sitting water-side, warm and dry, enjoying Bloody Mary’s ($10.99) and a crab chowder bowl from Salito’s. Really excellent service at the bar from Henry. His drinks were delicious too!

The crab chowder was really good! Big chunks of crab mixed in and sitting on top with delicious crusty bread to dip in the hot chowder. ($13.99)

The atmosphere here is upscale and relaxing and the restaurant has just a really exquisite layout. It’s beautiful water views and open-air seating all around.  I wish we’d made plans to spend the entire day in Sausalito, because we would have returned here for dinner!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The bay area is famous for its fine seafood, but Salito's really distinguishes itself from the rest. Seafood itself is predictable fare; nothing wrong with comfort food. Salito's conforms to these expectations in its dishes, but does something special to elevate each dish. My Dungeness crab was poached so excellently in garlic butter, it was almost funny that melted butter was included. It certainly wasn't needed. The service at Salito's is interesting; they are very popular and busy so they have adapted the service to accommodate. The service experience is a little impersonal, seeing a multitude of faces, but operates like a well-oiled machine. I got my food so quickly I was tempted to just order more.<//Review>

Their Dungeness crab roasted in garlic is simply the best crab I've ever eaten. I live in Maryland now and in New Orleans for 5 years. I went back 3 times in  a week savor this tasty crab. The Cioppino was also the best I've ever had. If you love crabs and seafood this is the place to go. The price was cheaper than similar dishes in San Francisco of lower quality.< /text>

Food is good and the view is beautiful. I would recommend lunch rather than dinner because you can't enjoy the view that much if it's dark.

The place doesn't have a very fancy look and the staff are nice, although sometimes too familiar (I like when staff are familiar but one of the guys kept coming every 5min to give us conversation and I found it a little excessive).

Food is great though! You have to try it once at least!< /Text>

1.5 hours to be seated. 30 minutes to get drink order. Overall spent 3 hours there.  Service was terrible. Apparently they were short staffed, our waiter was apologetic. Unfortunately he could not apologize for the poor service. Had crab, no cracker, Prime rib ordered medium rare, was not even rare, almost raw. This place is usually great. Wrong day I guess. Food is normally excellent. Portions are decent. I'll give it one more try.</Review>

I had been before when it was Paradise. Now going back it was a great experience again. We like going there on our way back from Russian River, stop by and have a great lunch. Order the special platter with crab, shrimp and mussels. The fresh bread is out of this world, I can eat that everyday. On a sunny day it's great to sit outside and contemplate the relaxing views of Marin bay. Perfect location, service is fantastic!< /Text>

Great view and the most delicious freshly baked bread. I would just go and order the bread and the chowder as that was definitely the best part of the meal. The steak was good, but the crab was very oily and both the steak and Crab we're pretty overpriced. Service was excellent.< /Text>

Ordered the house salad with crab and it was out with 5 minutes. The food was great! View was great! And very attentive service. I would stop in again!< /text>

Have neen there three times with several experiences. Different people were with me. Had reservations and Recommend when making them to request water view. If you have out of town guests great place to take them. I was able to find a parking spot in the lot. Recommend the crab as got twice.</Text>

Left waiting out in the cold with two young kids for nearly an hour, despite having a booking (and arriving on time). Otherwise food was fine, service was good, location is lovely. Plenty of heating on the deck if you end up outside, though the very waterfront tables do get quite a breeze.</Text>

Only been here once, but everything was excellent. We were seated and served promptly. We loved the open air atmosphere, as the restaurant opens to the water but yet customers are covered overhead and kept warm with outdoor heaters.

I had the garlic noodles with crab, which was excellent. Noodles cooked perfectly, still a bit firm, with a good portion of crab. My wife had salad and crab chowder in a bread bowl and loved it. Make sure to get the kettle bread - incredible!

Parking is tough, so if you dine during busy hours expect to park 100 yards away.<//Review>

<Text>Wonderful place to eat lunch, socialize. Dinner and even hold events. Very friendly people and waitors. A tad on the pricey side especially for the salades which really isn't much qua variety, but that is also typical in America I guess. Worth making the trip for. Great view as well.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Yes, this is a tourist joint but we love it so much. We go there every year. Love the sizzling seafood and the bread for 99 cents.< /text>

Stopped in one afternoon after hiking in the Main Headlands for an afternoon snack. I had crabwich which was pretty good. Fresh baked bread with crab, avocado and an onion dressing. Potatoes on the side were good but heavy. Others had the Crab Louis and crab salad. Wine and beer to drink as well as one Bellini. Overall everyone enjoyed their meal. Seafood seemed fresh and the views on a nice day are lovely. Be sure to sit outside. Pricey but you are paying for the experience. Service was slow but friendly and we weren't in a rush.< /Review>

<review>Ridiculous!
I ordered a whole crab Saturday for lunch $50 and there was hardly any meat in it.  When the waiter removed the top shell “garnish” I was extremely disappointed, the body was completely empty.  I was hoping the legs and claws would be meatier and full, disappointed again by the small overcooked dry slivers of meat; I probably didn’t get 4 ounces of crab meat. Two other people in my party ordered the crab sandwich and looks like that’s where my crab meat was.<//review><Gmap_id>0x808584516e36f9b9:0xd062e5c18afb1242</Gmap_id>< UserId.>

Awesome place for big groups. The family sized chiopino was huge and feed our group of 12, along with oats, grilled shrimp and a ton of the fresh sourdough loaves. Fun weekend brunch spot as well, but on sunny days there is usually a long wait and the parking lot can be packed, so you might have to pay for street parking.<//text>

Perfect mix of setting and style. Meat is cooked perfect and crab cakes are fresh and delicious. I recommend sitting under the heat lamps by the bay, it makes for a wonderful dinner.< /Text>

EDIT: 2nd time visiting
We returned and brought some guests here for a Monday lunch. The crab and super combo was better than I remember, but the steak is simply disappointing, I can't believe they call this ham-looking thing a prime steak. Brought out onto the table half cold.
The service was a little careless (forgot to bring us utensils after clearing the table for the first time), but extremely friendly. Would still return.

Great view and atmosphere, very friendly staff. We had the whole crab and the rib, very fresh materials but the cooking is not the top. Still, a nice place to stop by for lunch on a sunny day.< /Review>

I've only been there pre dinner time so there has been plenty of great service. Lucy at the bar is extremely pleasant.  Great views of the harbor and across the way to Tiburon.  Lots of outdoor heaters.  Not pretentious to me.  We've only had salad so far. They were very good but on the small side.  we also purchased a loaf of bread I think it was a 1.29.  Fresh-baked. It was excellent.  Served with butter but I think patrons would enjoy some olive oil also.  I'm sure they would provide some upon request.  I made some great croutons out of the leftover.  Calimari crust didn't hold up very well.  But certainly not a deal-breaker.  Great place for kickback cocktails.  Can't wait to come back and try prime rib or there other dinners.  Ambiance has a very nice fun feel.<//text>

2 stars for location, 1 star for food and service.  Locals visiting for a birthday celebration.  This is a churn and burn type of establishment.  Drinks were good.  Generous pours.  The appetizers were good fair price for the quality and portions of food being served.  Lunch deteriorated from there.  Entrees came before our salads.  Our waiter, while apologetic, struggled to recover but it just wasn't possible. There wasn't enough room on the table for our entrees and salads.

I ordered crab and prime rib.  Crab was clearly overcooked and held.  It was extremely dry and hard to remove from the shell.  The prime rib was cooked as ordered, but my 16oz of meat was ice cold when served. Again, not something the server could recover from.  Wine was decent, but costly for vintage and age.  My wife had crab enchiladas, came home and promptly threw up.   She doesn't have a weak stomach.  Some how I managed to avoid whatever she must have eaten.

Charging a premium and being premium are very different things.  Expect to be gouged if you eat here.  I'd rate this location as a cocktail only establishment.  You can get better food and service,  at a lower price close by.

Guys you need to step up your game.  The entire staff, from the kitchen down needs to be retrained.  There was zero coordination between the kitchen, bussers and servers.  They were all over each other and neither knew what the other was doing.  I know you can do better than this. Would I come back to eat here, no way.< /Text>

The food is average but the price is high. I have been there many times because my friends used to get together there! The sea view is wonderful especially if you find the table next to the sea and preferably indoor.
One time they charged me extra, way extra!!! I tried to contact them several time but they refused to solve the problem. I had my receipt with table number ... and I called them right after it appears on my statement. So make sure you check your account and keep the receipt.</text>

Great food. Great views.  Great service.  If you like the ambiance of a waterside restaurant that serves a great selection of seafood then this is the place for you. Also has parking right next to the restaurant which is a plus. If not park elsewhere and walk. Worth the trip.</text>

<review>Had the shrimp and the spinach salad--wasn't crazy about having to peel the shrimp but discovered that it was worth it because it kept them tender and succulent, and the garlic butter sauce was absolutely delicious.

Ordered the biggest size of Crab which contains 2 full crabs and all legs, it is 4 people share, but amazingly we 2 people completely finished it with a ball of vegetables and 8 oysters. It was great flavor.< /Review>

<text>This place has potentially, so maybe showed up with the wrong cook the wrong night.  Love the restaurant feel, not cramped and open to the deck right on the water.
Food: mussels were excellent, the crab-cakes very average, a little dry and tasteless. Prime rib very disappointed: did not pay too much attention, and first couple of bites were good (though slightly it was overcooked). Excess fat that should have been trimmed caused steak to be unevenly cooked and inedible. Waiter nowhere to be found. Mentioned to the waiter when he finally returned, and said we were nevertheless finished.  Instead of what he should have done and comped the steak (or part), he brought out a terrible dessert as a compensation.  End of the day not impressed, Im sure they can do better, but personally would rather risk something new next month.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1495831635232, 'text': "We appreciate your feedback, Matthew.\n\nWe're deeply disappointed to hear that your dining experience with us was less than ideal.

We ordered a seafood sampler, and the crab was very good. The mussels were a little bit small, but fresh and tasty.

I ordered the crab fettuccine, and other people in our party ordered the sand piper fish, crab salad, and shrimp dish. Everything was very great.

I will definitely try the sand piper next time, because I got a taste of it, and it was light, and very tasty.< /text>

<Text>The food was good. I enjoyed the crabwich and my mom had the crab enchilada which was good also. The service was not bad up until the end of our meal. The server was friendly and chatty, but maybe too much so. We also waited for 35 minutes to get the check AFTER we were clearly finished and the desert was taken away. This was ridiculous because we were obviously done and we wanted to go. We mentioned this to the server about 15 minutes after we were done with desert but he just walked away.

<review>It was really good with olive galic sauce even though your hand will be busy due to hard skin of crab.
The staff is very kind and if you have chance to seat outside, you can see nice view.
BUT parking is not easy even though there is parking lot which will be full shortly.<//review>< pictures>

Great food and location...the only thing that lets this down is the servers.A group of 6 of us visited on July 3rd and whenever we asked for anything the waitress would sigh and make it seam like everything was an inconvenience. A real shame because for the bad service we received, we would not re-visit this place. If you want good customer service...dont go here!</text>

Don't get the crab enchiladas, get the soup in a bread bowl. Don't sit at the tall tables near the bar even if directed to do so. No one tells you that the bartender is your "server." he was nice and but the problem.< /Review>

As an out-of-towner we had a small group that wanted to try something new and with the Positive reviews at this site we attempted this restaurant. Most of the food came out pretty good when it actually arrived to our table we had to ask our server multiple times four missing orders. The staff was kind but very disorganized. It got to a point at the end of the night where guests waiting for table came up to us and asked us to leave because we were there so long and they wanted our table. We were only there because the staff was unable to provide quick enough service. Even though with the poor service I would recommend some to try this restaurant during a less busy time. I hope the management can take this review and make some changes to alleviate these issues for other customers.< /Text>

<review>As an out-of-towner we had a small group that wanted to try something new and with the Positive reviews at this site we attempted this restaurant. Most of the food came out pretty good when it actually arrived to our table we had to ask our server multiple times four missing orders. The staff was kind but very disorganized. It got to a point at the end of the night where guests waiting for table came up to us and asked us to leave because we were there so long and they wanted our table. We were only there because the staff was unable to provide quick enough service. Even though with the poor service I would recommend some to try this restaurant during a less busy time. I hope the management can take this review and make some changes to alleviate these issues for other customers.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

One of our favorite restaurants in Sausalito. They have the same owner as the Dead Fish and the Stinking Rose which we also really like. Great ambiance, views and the food is wonderful. Oh and wine corkage is free so that's always a plus in my book.< /review>

I'm rating 3 stars. The three stars were for the food it was excellent. I took away two stars for the service our waiter couldn't figure out if he was coming or going. He couldn't get our order straight. Brought out some of our food 15 minutes before anybody else got their food. And messed up on the one Order and she had to wait another 15 minutes for her food. We were all finished by the time she got her order.<//review>

<Review>My boyfriend and I came here because of the reviews. We love prime rib, and crab and we wanted a good meal to celebrate our anniversary.

1) we sat right away
2) our table and seats were still dirty with crumbs
3) we ordered the crab fondue as an appetizer
a) it was watery
b) lukewarm
c) minimal crab
d) the toast was cold and stale unedible
e) the plates the gave us were dirty
4) we ordered wine
a) our wine glasses placed on the table upon ordering were dirty
5) we both ordered prime rib
a) very fatty pieces of meat lukewarm as well
b) the "vegetables" : Carrots, Black olives, shallots, corn
1) all cold and "old tatsing"
c) the potatoes : deep fried and smashed

We couldn't send our appetizer back until our server came with the bill, because that was the first and last time he checked on us. When we expresses our concerns about the entire meal he gave us the impression he wanted us quickly out just for the quick turnaround.

Our bill was over a hundred dollars, and we were no where near satisfied or happy. We got nothing we paid for.

I called and spoke with the manager and he gave a pretty generic response, he took my number and never heard back from him. They, in my opinion do not care about the service they provide, and the quality of the entire experience, ans it should be wondered what happens behind the scenes with what we saw on the stage.

We will not be returning, nor ever recommending this restaurant to anyone in this area. We were extremely disappointed.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1500226726676, 'text': "We appreciate the feedback, Heather.\n\nIt's unfortunate your time with us was less than ideal. \xa0We strive to offer quality service alongside our dishes. \xa0We regret that our team didn't go above and beyond to accommodate your needs and that our food didn't exceed your expectations. \xa0\xa0We care about the satisfaction of our guests and hold ourselves to a much higher standard. \xa0We'll be sure to address your review and concerns with the appropriate members of our team moving forward.\n\nWe do hope you give us another opportunity to demonstrate the high-caliber service we're accustomed to sharing with our guests."}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>There is no reason to order anything other than the dipwich. I mean, yes, everything else is delicious. My first time there I have the chilli shrimp fettucini and it was the second best pasta meal of my life, but unless you are a vegetarian you should order the french dipwich. Also ignore the blood orange margarita.<//text>< rating>

<review>If you come to Salito's Crab House you gotta sit on the patio, just right on the water. The view is absolutely beautiful on a sunny day.

First of all even though I am a fan of the restaurant they gotta do something about their staff I have been there twice last year and it's the same issues. They seem a little nonchalant and slow! very very slow! We asked about 3 different people for water and finally got it after a 15minute wait. I mean it's just water!

Anyway, bad service aside, the food a really good! The fish and chips is a must have! It's technically not chips, it's a kind of baked/fried potato, just great trust me!

I also had their Basa Inferno, it comes in a skillet and it's quite good. It's couscous, fish tomato sauce and some Habanero peppers.

It's definite worth to try but I hope they improve their service a little more to make the experience perfect.<//review>< rate>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Hubby and I split an order of whole dungeness crab (two pounds) and a pot of cioppino, along with an appetizer of mussels and shrimp in a skillet. I've never eaten anything so divine!! They had to use a wheelbarrow to roll me out of there. Free parking on premises (spaces are kind of tight though). Beautiful view of boats in the harbor. A guest in the next table choked on something and the restaurant staff jumped to help her, eventually calling 911 who were exceedingly quick to respond. She was OK, thank God.

June 2012 update - after two years away, we returned just to have another meal, and it was just as divine as we remembered!! This time we had a dog with us and Salito's was nice enough to accommodate our furry friend as well. Thank you Salito's!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Fun place, i wish they were playing some music! The prime rib was really good; the crab was not bad but didn't feel very fresh.< /Review>

<Text>We had a great time at Salitos! We ordered a whole dungeness crab and it was great! Unfortunately, the hostess was terribly rude!

My wife forgot her handbag and the hostess was not helpful at all. She  did not do any effort to trying to help us and was very rude in general.

I know she does not represent the restaurant, but this really affected our experience< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>1st time visiting, probably wasnt the best idea to visit on a Saturday night, without reservations.

Bar service was slammed, which meant about 15 minutes wait for service.  Bartender was super pretentious as I gave him a recipe for a drink, yet asked how I wanted it (just read what I tried presenting) and wasnt garnished properly.

Dining room service was a warm body who literally just took our order.  Aside from finally bringing me items, that I had asked for previously during ordering, we only saw him for the check.  The enchiladas were middle of the road, at best.  Took about 10 minutes to get sour cream for them.

I wouldn't recommend this place to family nor friends.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Please bring back the surf and turf special from pre-covid!
The crab here is SO good. They season it really well. Green onions, garlic and butter, I think. I could eat loads more of it. The corn, sweet potatoes, smashed whole potatoes, olives, are very tasty too. Also seasoned well - they use some seaweed, sesame seed salt. Best crab I've had.
The prime rib is tasty and comes with the same sides.
House salad is a step above regular house salads and very pretty. Has avocado, radish. Needs some lemon.
The beignets were delicious. Needed a bit more powdered sugar.
Panna cotta, also tasty, was light and delicate.
Beautiful views on their balcony. And the heat lamps were more than toasty. Service can be a little slower, but gives you time to enjoy the view and tasty food.

Crab and sides better than The Old Clam House on Bayshore Blvd in SF. Also safer area, better parking, views and food in general.

Highly recommend. Definitely coming back.</Text>

Regular beef cut was large and tasty. Panna Cotta was great. We were served quickly and politely. The view is pretty nice, even though not as cool as on the pictures.
Maybe because of the day, there weren't too many people here. Most of them sat outside.<//Review>

< Review>
Sausalito is a major tourist destination, and many restaurants (including this one) cater to them. The cuisine doesn't have to be great because most tourists are never going to be repeat customers.
The food here is very mediocre, the service is OK, but not stellar, and the interior decor is awful. It's somewhat expensive, but not at all sophisticated.
All that being said, the views are great, and there is some open air dining.< /Review>

Good food however terrible service for our meal. Saturday night at 6pm the restaurant was not very busy but was seriously understaffed.
For our party of 8, portions of our food and drink orders were totally forgotten by staff. Upon bringing this to their attention they were promptly forgotten again and finally were removed from the bill.
Upon requestung the check it took a trip to the wait statiin to retreive the check ourselves so that we could finally pay and leave.
I would not return.<//Text>

I wish I could give Salito's half a star or less...

If you are looking for a great dinning experience in this area, there are many other options. I would highly recommend Sushi Ran!!!! Scoma's, The Trident, or The Spinnaker would too make for better options. Please heed this warning!

My girlfriend and I made dinner reservations three weeks prior to our trip and the reservations were ignored. When we walked into the restaurant, the hostess haphazardly handed us menus and said it was open seating. We awkwardly waited five minutes for the booth we originally requested in our reservation. Our server, Neve, did not come to our table for another 15 minutes. When he finally showed up to our table, he asked us what we wanted to eat in an unwelcoming manner. He not only neglected to introduce himself, but he also didn't give us a run-through of the menu or the daily specials. We ordered some over-priced crab cakes and one drink. After an hour of sitting and waiting, we asked to leave. Managers and corporate representatives were contacted many times, but nobody cared to take responsibility. We not only drove 1,201+ miles for this vacation, but also live and work in Colorado and the best this company claims they can do is to offer us a dining voucher for the value we spent on August the 14th. My girlfriend works in the dining industry and we are both dumbfounded. Notice also that this post is going up on September 7th; this is how long we have been dealing with this headache. Simply put: seek out other dining options!!!!< /text>

Just doesn't provide the quantity or quality worthy of the price. Also did not informed the no feeding birds, so the sea gulls were too comfortable near the meal area.< /Review>

My husband LOVED his spicy pasta. My fish - meh. It was really very bland and tasteless. The location is AMAZING, and the ginger martini was lovely. There were open tables right on the water when we got there, and when asked if we could sit there, we were told, "No, we save those for larger parties". Ok, fine, like I mentioned, the views were still amazing - except that two other couples were seated on the water about 15 minutes later. Maybe it was because it was a Wednesday night, but other than the views and the martini, this place was very blah.< /review>

I had the Crabwich; $16 for a lowly white brioche bun, mayo drenched cabbage, and a few strands of the "prized" Dungeness crab.

Very nice setting, food seemed of good quality and the staff were very attentive. A little more expensive then some of the other places but you do get what you pay for< /Review>

Awful rip off, had a surf and turf and it was the worst meal I've ever had while eating out in my life and I'm nearly 40, the steak was abysmal and full of gristle, they used wafer thin poor quality meat, how they class it as steak is beyond me, $50 for the terrible main alone minus drinks..... You have been warned! I had a crab sandwich for $5 in SF for lunch the following day the had more meat and tasted better than the pathetic offering I was given. I don't give reviews but was so annoyed and angry I want to let others know. The owners should be thoroughly embarrased of the food served. A well deserved 1 star review.<//review>

< Review>
I rarely write reviews, but my visit here was so disappointing, I thought it necessary to let others learn from my mistake. The food was extremely over priced and average tasting at best. I paid $50 for surf and turf and still had two pay $4 for a coke and another $4 for a refill. Who charges for refills these days?!? Overall, a bill of over $100 for two people at a restaurant not much better than your typical chain garbage.</Review>

{'time': 1410197191169, 'text': "I never want to hear that you thought your meal wasn't worth the price, Scott, so I'm disappointed you didn't love what you ordered. We always source the freshest ingredients possible, and our kitchen staff is highly trained. These things factor into our prices, so we think prime rib and 1/2 order of crab is worth what we charge. Still, if you're looking to save a bit, I'd love for you to check out some of the other items on our menu. Our fish is delicious, for example, and there are lots of different kinds to try. As always, I appreciate the feedback.\n\nSincerely,\nPeter Demarest"}<//response>

This place is a bit overrated; not because it seems like a tourist trap, but because they skimp you on the ingredients. I had the Crabwich; $16 for a lowly white brioche bun, mayo drenched cabbage, and a few strands of the "prized" Dungeness crab. This place gets two stars rather than one only because it has a decent view of the bay. In conclusion, I will not go here again!< /Review>

Beautiful place with excellent water view. We had breakfast, my wife ordered toasts with vegies, and I had an omelet with vegies too. Everything was very good, the toasts had caramelized pineapple and were so tasty. The omelet was really good, but the vegies were something else, they were different than usual (I guess they grill them) and they were excellent! Unfortunatelly I am not local, otherwise I´d like to have lunch or dinner at this place. For sure I recommend it!< /text>

< Review>
Great service. Really great food. The chorizo cheese bread is outstanding. The crab chowder is really good. Crab enchiladas are amazing. And their fish and chips!? Those are the best fish and chips I have ever had. Basically a whole lightly fried fillet but absolutely perfectly cooked and flakey every time. Overall a great spot. Nice that it isn't as packed nor is it as expensive as some places in sausalito. Also really good views.</Review>

A great place for dates, especially if you're into getting messy as you both tear through a giant pile of whole dungeness crabs! Its got a fun atmosphere, outdoor seating on the harbor with a fresh bay-scented breeze, and the cioppino is excellent. On the pricey side, but you get what you pay for!<//Text>

Terrible food and service.  The spinach cheese dip was lukewarm and gooey/solid.  The prime rib was unremarkable as was the 1/2 dungeness crab that I ordered with it.  I asked for drawn butter for the crab and was given a partially melted tub of butter.  The only thing I got that was any good was the beet salad.  The fish fry was ok.  I brought my sister and brother in law here and was embarrassed at the food quality.  It does have a nice setting on the water.</Review>

Came in after fishing in the AM looking to have a nice cold beer at an outdoor bar in Sausalito.  We happened upon Salito's, went to the back porch bar, and the bar tender refused to serve us, accusing us of being on drugs, and being drunk (admittedly we had just finished fishing so we looked scrubby). We then approached the manager, Jorge, informed him of what happened, and he refused to acknowledge the experience. My conclusion is as follows: Restaurant NPS score = 0. NEVER recommending to anyone. ANYONE. We then went to Bar Bocce & Joinery, and had a fantastic time, dining experience and customer experience. Would highly recommend Bar Bocce or Joinery to anyone!!!< /Review>

The yellowtail carpaccio was amazing as was the whole crab.< /Review>< Pics>

Unfortunately the place was virtually empty when we are there... not what I expected on a wednesday evening. It seems we were labelled as tourists and placed as far from anyone as possible which wasn't really comfortable. No atmosphere except a woman drinking herself stupid on cocktails at the bar.

The crab was nice but you pay for the full crab, but don't get the full crab. The main body shell was empty. Where was all the nice rich dark meat ???
Maybe this is a US thing not to serve the whole crab, but for us europeans it is a travesty as it is the nicest part.<//text><GmapID>0x808584516e36f9b9:0xd062e5c18afb1242</GmapID>< pics>

Not good value, too pricey for mediocre quality

Good
- setting, decor, view
- menu

Bad
- service was atrocious (a story below)
- fountain soda watered down and not very bubbly
- food was meh

Bad service stories

Story 1
They have crab chowder available in a cup and in a bread bowl for 4 or 5 dollars more than the cup.

I wanted more chowder but not the bread so I asked for a bowl of soup, no bread. They brought out a slightly larger cup of soup.   I looked around at others at my table (party of 10) who had ordered the cup of soup and I noticed I had about the same amount as they did.

I asked the waiter, "This looks like the same amount of soup... do you think this is $4 or $5 more soup than the cup?"

Waiter says he'll look into it.  Now there is only one right answer, which is so simple: tell me you'll charge me for a cup, not a bowl.

Nope.

Waiter comes out with a normal cup filled with water and pours it into the larger cup (my non-bread "bowl"), and I think he's here to show me the great news, that I was right and he was going to charge me for the cup.

Nope.  It becomes almost clear that the bowl volume is ever so slightly larger than the cup volume, and the waiter does a proverbial mic drop "see, sir, there is more soup in the bowl."  Yes, there was at least 2 or 3 tablespoons full.

Even better (story 2), my sister and her family were here... my sister has a gluten allergy, makes that known. After she starts eating waiter comes flying out like he's seen a ghost to inform my sister that the dish she has contains gluten.

She's fine, but this is so bush league...<//Review>

Arrived here lateish on a Friday night with some friends. Place looked like it was going to be a little stodgy from the outside, but when we went in, we were pleasantly surprised. It's open and spacious, and we sat at an outside table right on the water. Lovely.

Had a beef sandwich with dipping jus - really good, and served on their home-made bread. Also recommend their hot beignets for dessert.< /Review>

<text>Food was decent but it's overpriced. I ordered the steak sandwich and the waiter asked if I wanted soup or salad. I asked if its included and he said it is but then charged me for it. $40 for a sandwich, two small salads and a crab soup with hardly any crab? No thanks< /text>< gmap_id>

<review>(Translated by Google) I ordered cram chowder and tomato seafood pasta and ate it. The liver was okay, and the pasta had plenty of seafood. The price was also good. I think it was in the 60-dollar range. The view is the best. I recommend it!

<text>(Translated by Google) Sausalito's representative restaurant. When the weather is clear, you can enjoy seafood dishes in your mouth with cool seas.
Relatively inexpensive, friendly service of the staff is more delicious. I visited Sausalito on a rainy day and was depressed, but I was able to eat and eat it again. I visited Christmas Eve and there were many family members, but I was able to get a window seat early. I have a lot of tips for servers that worked hard. ^^

(Original)
소살리토 대표 맛집. 날씨가 맑은 날 오면 시원한 바다와 함께 해산물요리를 입안에 가득 품을 수 있다.
비교적 저렴한 가격, 친절한 직원들의 서빙은 맛을 더 돋군다. 비오는 날 소살리토를 방문해 우울했지만 이곳 음식을 먹고 다시 힘을 낼 수 있었다. 크리스마스 이브에 방문해 가족 손님들이 많았지만 일찍 입장해 창가자리를 구할 수 있었다. 열심히 일한 서버들에게 팁은 두둑히 주길..^^< /text></record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) In keeping with Sausalito's riches, this is a very nice and delicious restaurant. The whole crab is definitely worth trying. Big in size and full in weight Shrimp and mussels. And the calamus must eat. The view is fantastic. The sea view is so art.

(Original)
소살리토의 부촌에 맞게 이 가게는 참 멋지고 훌륭한 맛을 제공하는 레스토랑이다. 홀크랩은 꼭 먹어보기를 추천한다. 크기가 크고 살이 꽉 찼다. 쉬림프와 홍합이 들어간 요리. 그리고 깔라마리 는 꼭 먹어야 한다. 뷰가 환상이다. 바다뷰가 너무 예술이다.<//Text><Time>1580078887886<//Time><gmapID>0x808584516e36f9b9:0xd062e5c18afb1242<//gmapID>< username>

<Name>Кумкват Багоев</Name><time>1579634042654< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>(Translated by Google) Great place for a positive gastronomic tourism. At the entrance we were greeted by a rusty anchor and a small queue (in the afternoon!). Our companion exchanged a few words with the hostesses and after a minute we were already very comfortable sitting and enjoying an extremely pleasant atmosphere. It was felt that the guests are carefree and enjoy.
The service is accurate / timely and simple, as if visiting a friend. You realize the importance of the profession of a waiter as an assistant, an intermediary between the kitchen and the guests. The kitchen has left the warmest memories in the hearts of our company.
The restaurant offered us four types of oysters and three sauces for them. I was very surprised at the opportunity to season oysters with special horseradish sauce, however, it was so unobtrusive and unexpectedly elegant for its breed that it did not cause any rejection. Shellfish were excellent! Sea, ocean, freshness and delight! The airy seafood salad (with crab, of course) and the delicate crabcakes that I tried for the first time were very skillfully performed, although they looked quite ordinary. Striploin and filet mignon in combination with baked vegetables (potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn) caused absolute satisfaction with the day, trip and life. To spoil this happiness could only non-starchy cold vegetables in the same plate, which, oh joy, was not in it. And of course, we could not but aggravate all this with the crab, and followed him. Dungeoness is much smaller than Kamchatka, there is not much meat in it, but you have to tinker. It’s better not to go to him without an apron. He visited our table in a pan, doused with spicy oil, seasoned with "secret garlic sauce." This was hard. We could not. But ate ... two.
For those who think that there is nothing special in the preparation of crab, I recommend to bite freshly cooked crab in a good specialized institution, and then purchase it on the market (for example, in Vladivostok), cooked ashore in the morning. It can be overcooked, overcooked and, oh horror (!!!), overcooked. Crab is easy to make, and spoiling is even easier. At Salito's he was introduced in the best possible way and taste. This unbelievably festive dinner was so inspired that after everything we had eaten, we didn’t want to give up donuts (fresh hot beignets). So, being overseas, dipping crumpet in cream, I mentally transferred to the small kitchen of my childhood, where my mother fried brushwood in boiling oil.
If you find yourself in the cold San Francisco, you can hardly avoid visiting the famous Golden Gate. Take a ride on the bridge to the other side, visit the warm town of Sausalito. You will have a wonderful view of the bay and the coast with live examples of good cuisine.

Прекрасное место для позитивного гастрономического туризма. При входе нас встретили ржавый якорь и небольшая очередь (днем!). Наш спутник перекинулся парой слов с хостес и через минуту мы уже очень удобно сидели и наслаждались на редкость приятной атмосферой. Чувствовалось, что гости беззаботны и получают удовольствие.
Обслуживание точно/своевременно и просто, будто зашел в гости к приятелю. Осознаешь всю важность профессии официанта, как помощника, посредника между кухней и гостями. Кухня же оставила в сердцах нашей компании самые теплые воспоминания.
Ресторан предложил нам четыре вида устриц и три соуса к ним. Меня очень удивила возможность заправить устрицу специальным соусом с хреном, однако, он был так ненавязчив и неожиданно элегантен для своей породы, что не вызвал никакого отторжения. Моллюски оказались превосходными! Море, океан, свежесть и восторг! Воздушный салат с морепродуктами (с крабом, конечно же) и нежные крабкейки, которые я пробовал впервые - были исполнены очень умело, хотя и выглядели совсем обычно. Стриплойн и филе миньон в сочетании с запечеными овощами (картофель, батат, кукуруза) вызвали абсолютное удовлетворение днем, поездкой и жизнью. Испортить это счастье могли только некрахмальные холодные овощи в той же тарелке, которых, о радость, в ней не оказалось. И конечно же мы не могли не усугубить все это крабом, за ним и шли. Дандженесс значительно мельче камчатского, мяса в нем немного, а повозиться приходится. Без фартучка к нему лучше не ходить. Он посетил наш стол на сковороде, облитый пряным маслом, приправленный "секретным чесночным соусом". Это было тяжело. Мы не могли. Но съели... два.
Тем, кто считает, что ничего особенного в приготовлении краба нет, я рекомендую откушать свежесваренного краба в хорошем профильном заведении, а потом приобрести его же на рынке (например во Владивостоке), сваренного на берегу утром. Он может быть пересолен, пересахарен и, о ужас(!!!), переварен. Краба легко приготовить, а испортить еще легче. В Salito's его представили в лучшем виде и вкусе. Этот невообразимо праздничный обед так вдохновил, что после всего съеденного, мы не захотели отказаться от пышек (fresh hot beignets). Так, находясь за океаном, макая пышку в крем, я мысленно перенесся на маленькую кухню моего детства, где мама в кипящем масле обжаривала хворост.
Если вы окажетесь в холодном Сан-Франциско, едва ли сможете избежать посещение знаменитого Golden Gate. Прокатитесь по мосту на другую сторону, посетите теплый городок Саусалито. Вам откроется чудесный вид на бухту и побережье с живыми примерами хорошей кухни</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWS12-BMHrhLjKis6vHb3oQPYYDC3TeywGR6zK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMyoW_k-QdRyUo1c66I_dOocFmgsQcy14EaeSg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaYI0a1Qp8JoJ7L6JJXRIiqa0cq7ZkHRM49S2f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAa3zt2MrreNcxgrsMbMgLx4EPEQvZUw4g62zJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNz8uEDhdqZ_ufLsnf1YvVoVkXEOmzuax328ZvN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcoxDjKCETj3Q1b1kUpfY4Zn61i-nD056NvEiD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9-LljcQA5uvsYsY7Lt7KukQkR_4ORkuFc_HyP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1579723982059, 'text': '(Translated by Google) Thanks for the great review, Kumquat Bagoev!\n\nIt’s great that you had such an amazing experience with us!

(Translated by Google) It's a restaurant with the best views and dishes of Sausalito. It was a pity that I couldn't taste many dishes since I was full, but the plump and fresh crab cocktail and the beef steak ordered with great expectation were really delicious. It's a bit pricey compared to the relatively inexpensive hophouses and restaurants around, but I think it's worth paying for it because you can have a delicious meal in a good atmosphere.

소살리토 최고의 뷰와 요리를 맛볼 수 있는 레스토랑이라고 할 수 있을거같네요. 배가 부른 상태에서 방문한지라 많은 요리를 맛볼수 없어 아쉬웠지만, 통통하고 푸레쉬한 크랩칵테일과 큰 기대 안하고 주문한 쇠고기 스테이크가 정말 맛있었습니다. 주변에 상대적으로 저렴한 호프하우스나 식당에 비해 조금 가격대가 있지만 좋은분위기에서 맛있는 식사를 할 수 있기에 그만큼의 비용을 지불할 가치는 충분하다고 생각합니다.</review>

(Translated by Google) After almost 10 days of food. American rapid or fastfood This has seemed wonderful. It is the closest thing to Mediterranean food, which we know.
The enclave is also very interesting because you are almost in the center stuck to the sea in a marina or pier. From sausalito the staff Very attentive, the restaurant very well decorated ample price right quality

(Translated by Google) Excellent service and regular food. We were very good and the waiter 'Josua' has managed to put 4 stars instead of 2. He was very nice, friendly and funny. The food: oysters and fettuccine of terrific seafood, meat and regular soup, and craby and oily crab.

Servicio excelente y comida regular. Estuvimos muy bien y el camarero 'Josua' ha conseguido que ponga 4 estrellas en vez de 2. Fue muy muy simpático, amable y gracioso. La comida: ostras y fetuchini de marisco buenísimo, carne y sopa normal, y cangrejo malísimo y aceitoso.</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Atmosphere.Taste all the best
No need for words ~ !!!
If you sit on the terrace and slice the steak and look at the pier ~
The view was great so I felt a little successful in life.
I heard that Prime Lip Medium Rare is a great taste.
The taste is soft and cut and chewed like any potato soup ㅋㅋ crab chowder
Oh and entrance automatic door is quiet ☆

(Original)
분위기.맛 모두 최고
말이 필요없음~!!!
테라스쪽에 앉아서 스테이크를 썰며 부두를 바라보면~
뷰가 멋있어서 약간 인생 성공한 느낌 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ을 받았다.
프라임립 미디움레어가 대존맛이라는 이야기를 듣고 시켰는데 진짜 ㅋㅋ너무 레어라 미디움으로 다시 부탁드렸는데
존맛 ㅠㅠ 부드럽고 무슨 감자탕고기마냥 부드럽게 잘리고 씹힌다 ㅋㅋ 크랩챠우더는 좀 짰다

뷰만 좋음. 직원이 무척 불친절함. 금발 여자 서버가 옷에 스테이크 소스를 흘렸지만 미안하다 한마디함.. 음식도 맛없음 립아이는 질기고 기름만 많음. 절대 추천하지 않음. 소살리토서 기분 버리고 싶다면 추천. 별 하나도 아까움</Text>

(Translated by Google) We went to this restaurant for the good comments, but for us it was a real disappointment. We ordered the crab and the ribs. The filet had no flavor and the crab (ox) was much worse, it tasted like nothing and was literally fried in an oil of dubious origin. Refreshment without refill (4 dollars each drink).

Waiters very nice and helpful. Good views of the port. It has parking.

If you expect to eat something similar to seafood or good meat ... this place is not what you imagine.

(Original)
Fuimos a este restaurante por los buenos comentarios, pero para nosotros fue una auténtica decepción. Pedimos el cangrejo y las costillas. El filete no tenía sabor y el cangrejo (buey de mar) era mucho peor, no sabía a nada y estaba literalmente frito en un aceite de dudosa procedencia. Refrescos sin refill (4 dolares cada consumición).

Camareros muy agradables y serviciales. Buenas vistas al puerto. Tiene aparcamiento.

Si esperas comer algo parecido al marisco o buena carne... este lugar no es lo que imaginas.< /Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) We stopped to eat here by chance, and the truth was a pleasant surprise. It is not cheap, but neither scandalous. We ate on the terrace, very nice, overlooking the bay. I recommend wearing a jacket because although it was noon, in October, it was cool. We take the sausage opener that has half a loaf of bread, with a delicious sauce, and secondly some "winchs", I think of chicken and philly cheese steak, we both delicious. The fries are surprising, they are tiny and whole, crushed to make them well. The prostrate was also rich.

(Original)
Paramos a comer aqui de casualidad, y la verdad fué una grata sorpresa. No es barato, pero tampoco escandaloso. Comimos en la terraza, muy agradable, con vistas a la bahía. Recomiendo llevar una chaqueta porque aunque era medio día, en Octubre, hacia fresquito. Nos tomamos el apertivo de chorizo que lleva media hogaza de pan, con una salsa riquisima, y de segundo unos " winchs", creo que de pollo y philly cheese steak, riquisimos los dos. Sorprenden las patatas fritas, que son pequeñitas y enteras, machacadas para que se hagan bien. El postré tambien estaba rico.<//Review>
