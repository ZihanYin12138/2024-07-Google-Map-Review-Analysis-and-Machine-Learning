I’ve always had a great experience in reaching out to my HOA office. Responses have always been quick and detailed enough to satisfy my inquiry. Most recently Victoria has been extremely helpful in helping coordinate and resolve an issue at my home. I was very unsure of how to resolve at first but she’s been able to see through all the steps with me. Thank you Victoria!</Text>

<Review>Victoria Harris is very professional and prompt in responding and following up on all matters of concern pertaining to each and every one of my major/minor items of interest and concern in the Winding Walk Community. See doesn't give you a lot of lip service with no results. She ensures all of your concerns are being or have been addressed. Thank you Mrs. Harris you do not go un-noticed and your dedication and taking ownership in addressing all residents matters of interest and concerns is very much valued and appreciated and makes residents feel like they are a valued key-shareholder and part of the Winding Walk Masters Association TEAM!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOJhGtVP0Y92fTTnEv-XXbfit1eZp2yZtvSZLn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWzzICvePuSgjseH2jVnAxlP1szjBdeMhgRu_1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSas4d_fzrF3hxiA3UEhjcJ83zhvQDp0xNmezl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80d954ac2a2b51af:0x98442b97e02ffc7b< /GmapID></record>

I had an unfortunate mishap in the village and Ashley worked with me diligently to correct the problem and make things right. She was professional, understanding, and very well versed in the policies and procedures of the HOA, making it easy for her to solve our problem. I really have the feeling that this company is here to enforce rules and make this community flourish, but at the same time keep the members, who pay the dues, happy with fair treatment and understanding. It is much appreciated. Thank you for the great work Ashley.< /review>< Pics>

Ashley Bernadino is the manager of the Friars Village HOA in San Diego. She recently helped me sign up for the TownSq app. I had problems connecting via my own computer. She took the time to give me a tutorial. Ashley also helped me with another matter. She responded to my email at 11pm, on her personal time. Even though it was an especially busy time for her (upcoming Board meeting and preparation of Board packet), I found Ashley to be very kind, thorough and professional.</review>

She was able to thoroughly review and explain my account, in a manner I could understand, and also emailed me a detailed copy for my records. I appreciated the time she spent to help me resolve my issue. Ms. Villa demonstrated exemplary customer service!</review>

The HOA scheduled work to be done which was going to require access to numerous homeowners garages.  I couldn’t take a full day off of work and needed a specific time frame.  Karen was able to arrange for the work in my garage to be done first thing so that my time away from work and lost wages were minimal.  She was very responsive and helpful in getting the scheduling resolved and I am grateful for all of her help!</text>

After years of just getting along in Friars Village I have recently had two occasions  to contact the office.  Both times I talked with Jessica Roach.  She was pleasant to talk with, had great answers to my questions and was very responsive to my calls.  In short Jessica was professional yet friendly, and totally responsive to my questions, even emailing to me the details to answer one of my concerns.  It was a pleasure to do business with her.</review>

<Review>I called our local Community Guidelines Coordinator (Angelica) to inquire about the current fence paint/stain colors which I couldn't readily find in our HOA Architectural Guidelines. Angelica was very kind and helpful, she clearly answered my questions and quickly emailed me the information I needed and stayed on the phone until I received her email. Had I been more thorough in searching through the HOA Architectural Guidelines, I would have found the information I was seeking, yet, Angelica was very patient and understanding with me.
Kudos to Angelica<//Review>< gmapID>

Victoria was always pleasant and helpful while doing her job. We recently brought to her attention an issue regarding our front yard landscape.  Victoria helped resolving the problem to our satisfaction without delay.

In a modern world of business, it is very impressive to deal with such a professional and responsive person like Victoria.

Please keep our review in Victoria ’s personal file, since she deserves recognition for her hard work.

<text>I received a Resolution Remittance notice from my HOA for two findings that were both honest and accurate.
I was able to resolve both issue and submit responses vis email. I received reply back within hours to confirm the issue has been resolved by actions we took and that I would be receiving electronic response back.
I wasn’t sure what to expect, however I am pleased to have received response from a human being thanking me for providing response.
Overall I’m impressed by the timeliness and promptness of the response. Excellent!< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Whoever from Prescott manages the Units at 235 Market doesn’t seem to do...well...much of anything really.
-Pretty much everyone is vaccinated against COVID now and the gym is STILL closed as of 07 JUN.
-Graffiti on windows is still there after more than a month.
-Multiple thefts with no action taken to increase security.
-Fees and fines for every little thing, but really get no benefit from the HOA dues every month.

My Name Is Jim Taylor and I am a production manager for Integrity Restoration. We have a client that lives in a development that is managed by Jessica. I needed information on how to proceed to do the work at our clients property. Jessica was very helpful and explained what we need to do for the HOA. Within an hour I had all the paperwork so I could proceed with the project. Thank you Jessica for your help.</Review>

<review>Ashley Bernardino and Prescott companies recently took over the management of our community.  I’ve lived here almost two years and it is only in the last 6 weeks that we have been under the new management that I have seen professional service to a high standard and proactive communications.  Then the gardeners came today and the level of service was really impressive.  I was told it was the same gardeners but they must be far better managed or have clearer expectations provided to them...they definitely did the best job today that I’ve seen in the two years I’ve lived here.  Happy to see this change!< /review>< Pics>

Working with Katy Venegas has been great!  She has addressed my concerns as best she could since decisions made by ARC are out of her control. She is quick to reply and very patient. Awesome job Katy, keep up the good work!

So 5 stars to her and carrying my survey results at 4. If not for Katy, my survey stars would be at 2 or 3 max.

That said, I’ve been somewhat disappointed with the ARC process and how they deny things without showing reason or face to have constructive conversation, just send Katy to fend with us homeowners.  Suggest when denials are done, reasons and conversation follow quickly after. Just makes better sense to talk things over instead of having to wait for appeal process.  It’s a bit frustrating to see neighbors in community getting approvals while others aren’t given the same request.<//Review>

I have worked with other HOA companies without issue and have no problem following the guidelines but they will fine you for absolutely no reason.  They "claim" to have sent prior warnings but when you ask them to resend them the time stamps are all the same day you requested them.   I do work in IT and the documents they sent are clearly modified.  Goodluck.<//Text>< rate>

This HOA requested $50 for the community card which I agreed to. I asked them to hold my card as I am in Arizona much of the time. They told me today that they threw my card away with no regard for its value. These people are highly unprofessional and there is no value in their service.</Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< Date>

<review>Had an emergency situation at our unit and it took us 5 hours to get a hold of anybody that could help us. Once we established communication they were effective, and helpful. However, for the HOA fees we pay every month (close to 400) it was aggravating to have to play phone tag for such a long time while the problem was not being tended to (major bathroom leak).< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1616618728798, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback.

Katy has handled an awkward situation for her involving my neighbor who is trying to weaponize the association against us by making random complaints targeted at us. I understand Katy has to address each complaint but the way she has gone about it has been as good as I could ask for. It is too bad someone can take rules that are supposed to enhance our home ownership and turn them into a tool to try to make someone else miserable. The problem neighbor is an ex-San Diego PD Detective and was on the association board at her last residence. Now she is living alone with no authority over anyone and it is killing her. We just want to be left alone. One of her complaints is I put my trash out before 6PM. The last time she complained I put the cans out between 4:30-5 PM. I looked up and down our street and just from my house I counted 9 other neighbors who already had their cans out. Surprisingly, We were the only ones she complained about.  I have thanked Katy for the way she has listened to our concerns, I have supplied her with photos of some of the things my neighbor at 790 Stone Canyon Rd has done and she has been as supportive as she can be. Thank you.< /Text>

<review>After months of neglect by previous property management of a serious water intrusion problem, Ashley, our current manager is actively seeking a solution.

I am grateful to have a company and a manager who care about our property.  M Owens

This company is new to our HOA.  There is much to do to handle maintenance and landscaping that has suffered from neglect.  The new Manager, Ashley and her assistant, Jessica are handling a great backlog.  They have been extremely responsive to my issues for which I’m grateful.

Once again these two ladies responded to my requests.  They have been extremely helpful in an ACR process and now getting some attention to landscaping next to my unit which has been neglected for the last four years.

Thank you for caring about our property!  M Owens< /review>< Pictures>

Being new to our townhouse community, we contacted Ashley Bernardino, our HOA manager. She quickly set up an appointment with us to go over our questions and give us information about the community. After our meeting, she followed up with an email to let us know she was working on providing us with some additional information. It was a pleasure working with Ashley and we are so glad she is here! Thank you Ashley!</review>

Contacted Prescott Companies at Camelot HOA at Eastlake Shores in Chula Vista, CA to report a water leak in between a wall in our Condo. I was only able to contact Cristina Aviles through email or post on  Town SQ. Even if you leave a message, no one will call you back. Granted, their services are limited due to COVID19. After my contact with Cristina Aviles, she dispatched a Technician....then dispatched a plumber to temporarily stop the leak. From this point, I requested feedback on a scheduled date for repairs. Did not get that feedback until 6 days later.....not to mention I still have to wait another 6 days for the repairs to be made.

To be fair,  Cristina Aviles is the General Manager for the entire condominium complex for over 500 units. She is only one person where the demands are thousands from the homeowners. Prescott Companies should consider additional support to alleviate the load.</Text>

While I’m not a fan of 75% of what your communicating to us at Friars Village that’s 99% NOT your fault. I only gave you 99% because I have no idea who exactly to blame for these new ridiculous rules!

I did not click responsive as a great characteristic yet because I have yet to need you but my husband just put in a maintenance request this morning so we will see lol.

Now that being said and all jokes aside...I want you to know that you are an ABSOLUTE breath of fresh air Ashley and you deserve a raise 😉 Compared to the last management company that we dealt with I love Prescott! Thanks for being very good at your job! I really appreciate it as I’m sure everyone else does too. Communication seemed to be a problem for the last company but not for you. I hope you guys are around for a long time.

Katy Venegas was very helpful and responsive to our calls and emails. I was super impressed with the quick turn around on a package we submitted to the HOA. Regardless of the outcome of our request to the HOA, Katy made the process simple and provided excellent feedback and outstanding customer service. Thanks Katy!!</text>

<Review>"The Prescott Companies controls homes, condominium & townhouse
communities in Mexico, Canada & the USA." Those living in this type of community only own the inside area of their home - most are worth about $650,000 to
900K+, depending upon where the community is located.
EVERYTHING outside of their unit's boundaries are considered a part of the "common area" and ALL maintenance outside of one's property line, including roofing, painting, road paving,is taken care of by the association.
A few homeowners utilize the greenbelt between Luisito and Salado as a short cut to the northeast exit/entrance gate.
This makes it great for Californians
because, it's the nature of some Californians; many who are self-centered, to walk down this or any greenbelt however, many of the townhouses have downstairs bedrooms; thus, it is imperative to have closed blinds and thick curtains, so a few walker's eyes don't "accidentally wander into one's bedroom?"
Some homeowners, vote every few years to elect the association's "Board of Directors;"each Director must be a homeowner and it's the Board and association that make all the rules that all homeowners must adhere to or possibly face a warning or violation; the fines are either $50 to $100.
The HOA Board of Directors are usually the most seasoned homeowners however, they serve as volunteers, a job where they use their past work experiences/skills in order to serve their community.
Any homeowner may attend their open association meetings however, l've just never felt like I fit in and have only attended one since I've lived here thus, I know very little about what takes place during a meeting.
The HOA also holds "closed meetings" that homeowners may not attend, which I view as sketchy.
NOW, a computerized medium/system called TownSquare, which is how every homeowner communicates with Prescott, the association or eachother, in order to pay bill's, talk about Village matters, etc.,etc.,etc. Through TownSq.,one can use their computers to "talk" about EVERYTHING/ANYTHING that they'd like to see done.
This is the type of living style where some residents don't care to be bothered and very few of them even know their neighbors; I am one of those residents who values my privacy!
In our country, where guns are ablaze everywhere & mass killings have increased in frequency over the last few years, especially within a number of our schools: COVID-19 has only exasperated things yet, too many people - all over the world - are still becoming infected and dying, especially in the poorer countries.
It would be nice to have a Security Station at the entrance or at least a couple of securityguards who both patrol - using a truck - and performing walk throughs?
Then there is the doggie sign that faces my bedroom window & our upstairs balcony where many villagers often brought their dogs to defecate & urinate; by summer & as it gets hot,the high levels of nitrogen in their doggie's urine causes the grass to yellow and then die yet, as long as it's not in front of their unit, I didn't think that most of them cared yet, it seems to have come to a virtual stop over the last few weeks?
It was also very unappealing to watch this senario, while trying to eat on our balcony or through my bedroom window.
Eventually the grass roots die too, leaving a bare circular space of dirt.
A little water might help, during the early morning and late night hours in order to prevent quick evaporation.
The only gate, located at the high northeast end of Luisito and Salado, serves as the only exit/entry for many villagers & before they installed a spring loaded system, it would slam shut loudly & wake me up constantly!
The Friars Village Clubhouse is closed
I prefer to keep to myself & my only friends are two humans and my cats.🐈✌<//Review>< date>

< review>
I just purchased my condo back in September and with all the problems I have had. I not recommend people buying a property at Camelot. The office manager makes appointments she can’t keep and because of that my car got towed for no permit.  Then she never told me that if I drop my check in the drop box that would take too long to process and I would get a late fee of 31 which she still hasn’t reversed. Still waiting on my fees from towing to be reversed and half the time she’s not working and has reduce hour’s and does make it to appointments on time.

The property manager called me and address all my concerns and was able to fix everything. Wanted to thank Cristina for reaching and helping me with everything< /review>

Hands down on Ms. Ashley Bernardino! I would not normally give 5 stars to customer service rating but Ashley is so kind, professional, timely and very accommodating. She definitely deserves all the accolades as she is truly an asset to Prescott Companies.< /text>

I normally don't provide feedback but this time I don't want the service provided by Ashley, unnoticed. I was planning to do some work within my property but wasn't sure what information I needed to provide or what was the process to follow. Ashley was very responsive providing all the information I needed and also responding all the questions that came up. Thanks to her help, I was able to collect the information required and submit it for validation and approval. I know that next time I have questions related to my property, Ashley is the person to go. Thank you Very much!</Review>

Haley Murphy, the Manager of Rolling Hills Ranch Homeowners Association, has been very responsive in her handling of a significant issue behind my house. The common area hillside appears to be slipping downhill and is taking some of my backyard with it.
Very quickly, Haley has initiated action to determine what is causing the hillside slippage.
Haley Murphy has always responded in the fast, professional manner in resolving problems with homeowner’s issues.
I very much appreciate her help.

< Review>
Ashley Bernardino is an asset to the Prescott Companies and has served the Rolling Hills Ranch HOA with courtesy and professionalism. As residents of East Chula Vista we are proud of our community and take pride in home ownership. Therefore, when it comes time to improve the appearance of our home we appreciate the can-do attitude of Ashley and her flexibility to work with us and the HOA board members.
The synergy between homeowners and the Prescott Companies has been a positive experience for our family. Thank you for making us feel important and for actually listening to our questions and concerns.
Sincerely,
Mr. & Mrs S.<//Review>

Worst service I've ever experienced. I moved in two weeks ago, work from home and can't get internet installed from any provider because they need access to a room on the property that is locked to activate my lines. I have sent an email every day to multiple resources at the company, and not one person has responded. I couldn't have worse things to say about a business.< /text>

EXPECT TO WAIT OVER AN HOUR!!!!!!!!

I have an appointment at 3:00 and it's already 4:15 I happen to come early to the appointment and they received me before 3:00.
Yet I am still waiting here for the doc. Crazy thing is that I am the only person here! I have never in my life had to wait oh so long for them just to have a check up done it's RIDICULOUS.

Don't wast your time on seeing the doctor here. They honestly need to work on reaciving people faster.< /text>

My aunt was coming to this place and sometimes she forgets to bring her money. However, one day there was a noncompassionate front desk worker. My aunt only had 20 bucks on her that day. She asked if she could pay the rest when she came back. The front desk worker would not have it. She was rude to her and told her that if she didn't pay the 25 dollars that she was going to put her down as that she missed her appointment so that they would charge my aunt the late appointment fee. My aunt proceeded to tell the woman that the male had let her pay like that before. Then the front desk worker began to ignore my aunt, she was typing on her computer and writing things down. My aunt thought this was absolutely childish behavior. Very non professional to help work out solutions with loyal costumers. Like i get it's low income but it is not an excuse to treat the customers like trash. Anyway my aunt got tired of being ignored so she pretty much said fine do whatever you want and walked out. When my aunt tried to schedule another appointment they had written a note in her file that she refused to pay. After that they did not allow my aunt to make any more appointments. We need compassionate healthcare workers at this site. Like isn't that why they went into the field? To help their community? Hopefully they change behavior around and hire professional personnel. TL;DR: front desk worker was rude to my aunt.<//Review>

<text>Absolutely terrible! Would give zero stars if I could. The people are not welcoming at all no experience I have tried getting my prescription filled for over a month now and they keep giving me the wrong information on the prescription. Wait time I’m waiting room is over an hour and wait time in the room is typically over an hour as well. Would highly recommend going anywhere else. I’m now out of my medicine and have no idea when it’ll be filled because of these people. I have never in my life experienced such uneducated “doctors” before. I should not have to reschedule my appointment to get my prescription four times! Absolutely disgusting.</text></record></dataset><record>

Who ever is at the front desk should be fired. I've been forced to come here and appear to have ZERO options about it if I want mental help.

My 'psychologist' just quit on me because I asked him to be professional. Anyone gonna follow up? Hell no.< /text>

< review>
Covid vaccines are ONLY to be administered to individuals that are in their respective phases. Some of the staff in this clinic administered them to their own family members, therefore limiting the already limited amount of vaccines to the individuals in phase 1. Personally, I would not want my health in the hands of a healthcare worker who prioritizes their own selfishness over the health of their community as a whole. Having an average rating of less than 2 stars is not surprising.</review>

I had a great experience with the opthamologist, Dr. Sharma.  She listened to my concerns, told me how to get the testing I needed, and then did a great follow-up with me.  I'm thankful for the time Dr. Sharma gives to this clinic.  She treated me with the same respect and dignity that she would have if I came in though her personal office.< /Review>

Every one at the Foundation is professional and courteous.  Sometimes there is a wait because multiple services are being provided to the patients.  It saves the patient several trips so to combine Medical, dental and EyeCare on the same day is actually of benefit to the patients.
The place is cleaner than any other Clinic you will visit - private or Community Clinics. This is strictly enforced throughout the departments
Case Management and Nutritional education is excellent, which has helped the physicians and specialists to better control chronic conditions like Diabetes and Hypertension.
Patients are given an option of evening and weekend appointments and many come from as far away as Green Field  and King City, Los Banos and Turlock.
Don’t take my word for it- make an appointment and experience for yourself the services provided at the Health Foundation.
All are welcome!<//Text>

I went to this place a year ago to become a new patient and I haven't heard from them...my health provider sent what they needed and I'm still waiting for the call... they are unprofessional, they don't know how to welcome new patients... at that time I was not feeling good and I needed a doctor but they didn't take me because they wanted my medical record.... They need to focus more on costumer attentiveness and welcoming.<//review>

She's just there to make a buck, doesn't care to explain anything. Literally just came and started drilling in my mouth. I wasn't giving any sort of numbing cream or "laughing gas", so I was pretty shocked she just went in there and starting drilling into my tooth. I literally pulled away believing they had missed a step in my cavity removal process. I'm no punk but the pain caught me by surprise, she could have at least told me something. I would have given more stars but that lady pissed me off. I hear Dr. Phan is better mannered and overall a better dentist to be around, will request him on my next visit.</text><rate>2< /rate>< pictures>

Highly unorganized, unprefessional, discourteous, and inconsiderate staff. Appointments are invaild. Clinic has you waiting for hours with or without appointment. Staff seems lost, unaware of their own procedures. Staff also seems disgruntled with one another, are uncooperative and unwilling to help with any question you may have. New staff needs to be hired immediately and trained properly. Consider other clinics before coming to this one. I know San Jose is a drive from Hollister but if you can spare the drive, Clinics in San Jose are better.</Review>

The place takes long to attend some people and once they attend you, you have to wait some more like my mom and I went to a check up and we waited about and hour and then they called us up and they took us to a room and we waited another two hours for a nurse to come, we would've waited longer but my mom kept asking so that was good</review>

<text>Unprofessional place!!

📍NO doctors
📍schedule  is always full
📍They wont give you a Rx refill, even though their appointment  schedule is full.
📍They'll  charge you $20, if you choose  to leave, because you've been waiting for 2 hours and haft to go to work.
📍staff will yell at you, and give you attitude, gaby is the worst.
📍they will schedule you  appointments, without your knowledge, then charge you $20
📍you'll always see new faces, new doc, MA's nobody last.
📍CEO is rude, doesn't care about the pt, just the $.

📍They are always hiring people with no expiriance, one day I saw a MA help me in the MA side. Then for my a dental appointment, she was assisting my doctor. in the dental side, then when I had my vision appointment the same girl, was taking my measurements in the vision side and assisting the vision doctor,
📍but the reason I left, was because, one girl DREW MY BLOOD and couldn't find my VEIN! they stiked me 5 times, then anorher girl came to help and she couldn't  find it eather. They ended up drawing blood on my hand, it left me with a HUGE BRUISE, both in my arms, and my hand! I was in so much  pain, and felt a numness sensation.
📍when I requested my medical records it took them 4 months, to give them to me, and they still had the nerve to charge me $25.</text>< UserId.>

They call you at least four times a month to try to get you to come in for something you don't need. They will bill you and penalize you when you don't even NEED the insurance. Then when you go and actually USE THE INSURANCE, You go to a hole in the wall that tells you to go to another hole in the wall ALL THE WAY in San Francisco, yet you have had that illness for over 13 years, and YOU LIVE IN HOLLISTER. I too had the Indian lady seen in that pic. Lord have mercy on her sole.</review>< GmapID>

Stay away from this place.  There is criminal activity going on.  When you call they never inform you of anything concerning cancelations or standard procedures--there are financial crimes happening and it seems like no one is doing anything about it---please call any watchdog group to begin an investigation---I urge you to investigate since most people who go there that are being preyed upon are poor and sick who need the help---most probably have no way of defending themselves.< /text>

This is very important - if you can avoid this place please due. It is unsanitary, unfriendly, the wait is super long, and get this if you call to talk to billing there is no one to tal to you have to make an appointment to come in in person. It is really the absolute worst ive ever been to.

I took my two kids to the dentist and was told they had several cavities. I decided to get a second opinion and was told my daughter only had one which didn't even need to be filled since the tooth was falling out soon and my son had none. NOT A ONE. This place is a scam.</review>

Very uneducated "doctors". I have seen 3 different doctors and each one misdiagnosed me and each visit was for a separate issue. Its unbelievable.<//text>

I have been here several times and it is horrible. I have had to wait over an hour to be seen three times. I had fillings done and at the site of one my gum got infected and I might need to have my tooth extracted because of it. I was there today for a cleaning and waited almost an hour while two people who came in after me were helped before me. I asked to speak to the manager and he was useless. He never introduced himself and was on the defensive the whole time. Four times I have called to find out about obtaining my dental records and never got a call back. They say I owe them $20 for a cancelled appointment even though I was there but left when it was 20 minutes past my appointment time because I could not wait any longer and there was two year old in the lobby having a tantrum. Not one staff member had the sense or the caring to ask one of the child's parents to take her outside while the other one dealt with reception.</Text>

The absolute worst place you can go to. No real medical professional ever on staff and the accounting department is incompetent unprofessional and ignorant.  My child was turned away with a high fever  when we showed up for an urgent appointment due to an alleged outstanding balance and though we argued that it had to be a mistake because we've had coverage through my husband's employer they were completely inept and simply said we needed to take our child somewhere else.  A few weeks after that horrible experience I contacted their accounting department requesting an account statement which was at that point corrected and adjusted proving it was a processing error. But after many attempts to reach someone in management regarding the incident I got nowhere and it is very clear that nobody else cared.
If you are thinking about going here for any reason my recommendation is you keep looking for some place else.  This place is a nightmare to deal with!< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I could not believe what poor customer service I received from most of the health clerks. I needed a referral and the staff were completely incapable. They referred me to a Doctor who didn't accept my insurance and when I brought it to their attention they referred me to another Doctor who also didn't take my insurance.They avoided my calls and when I went in to ask for the clerk who was helping me they all lied and said she wasn't in day after day. I finally had to call my Blue Cross provider myself to be referred. They never apologized. Also, my children and I have arrived for appts and we've been told,"Sorry the Dr./Dentist won't be in today", and the few times I missed an appt. we were charged $20. I've asked to speak to someone in charge repeatedly and some clerk, 'Irma' tells me she's in charge and is completely rude and GHETTO!!!! I just found a new health care provider and dentist for my children and I.< /text><name>Anna Ordonez</name>< Date>

At 1st everything looked very nice and the price seemed fair...but then Itbecame apperent that there is no real professionalism. The dentist seeing me said 'it was his last day, and they would have someone new in a a week or so..." I need an extraction NOW. They said they had a perscription for me and NOTHING, I AM ON THE PHONE NOW FOR 22 MINUTES AND i NOT ABLE TO TALK TO ANYONE WITH A BRAIN....<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Horrible service, they quote you one hour and attend you two hours later or if they do not say that the system was gone and they do not have adequate control of the arrival of people. There are almost no people to take so long it is really desperate.

(Translated by Google) Terrible service!!!! They believe they have the right to dispose of my time when they call you at 2 in the afternoon and spend 40 minutes without even appointing any person or doctor or dental ... I just go and they will charge me because I "cancel the appointment" when One shows up but they are the ones who do not feel like not attending to you ... I wonder why I quote many people if they are going to be in a lunch or doing I don't know what ... lousy attention ... hopefully the 20 Dollars that they charge serve them for more training or something

Pesimo servicio!!!! Se creen con el derecho de disponer de mi tiempo cuando te citan a las 2 de la tarde y pasan 40 min sin siquiera nombrar a ninguna persona ni medico ni dental.. simplemente me voy y me van a cobrar porque "cancele la cita" cuando uno se presenta pero ellos son a los que no les da la gana de no atenderte... me pregunto yo porque citar a muchas personas si van a estar en lonche o haciendo no se que... pésima atencion... ojala los 20 dolares que cobran les sirvan para mas entrenamiento o algo asi<//Review>

Great mechanic that I really feel I can trust. He helped me with an oil change, inspection, and some fluid work. In comparison to other mechanics, I felt this inspection was, one free with the groupon I had, but also very helpful and thorough. I feel confident in knowing what the actual problems are with my car.

As I worked on these, I ultimately felt trustworthy of their advice, their prices were generally competitive or better, they were very smart, and Javier is extremely understanding. I had to stop because of expenses and he made this to not be a tense moment. He's an extremely personable and kind guy, from my experience.

Another plus, I never had to wait forever for help!

I recommend them if you need some car help.<//review>

<Review>They've been my auto repair place for years and years for every car we have. Javier and Bud and their team are super! Excellent service! They stand behind their word, and where my previous auto shop did not repair a long term problem, they did! I could go on and on about how great they are, but I don't have all day. I'm 56, and they're the best I've had my whole life!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>I can't say enough about the great service we received. We were treated more like family than customers. Javier was excellent and our car was checked completely before our long road trip. Great prices too! I'd highly recommend this place for your auto needs!! Thank you, Javier!!!</text>< Name>

Only reason I came here was for the Groupon oil change they told me that I needed to replace my brakes so they did the service and car was still making noise so I went back waiting another 2-3 hours & they still didn’t fix it all they claim that one of there guys didn’t tighten something up. Ended up coming here 5 times. Don’t recommend coming here unless you want your time wasted, Poor customers service & service done wrong.< /Text>< Pics>

I would give them zero star if there is the option. They are liars and treat their customers like trash.
I bought a Groupon for oil change and tire rotation at this store. I called them in the morning before I left home, asking them if they are OK with me bringing my own oil and filter. They told me OK. But when I got there, the guy at the front desk kept whining that they won't make money if I use my oil and filter. And they wanted to charge an additional $7.99 which I never got charged before in my last two visits. After waiting for more than 2 hours, they called me saying that they can't get the canister off for the filter change, and they want to charge me $90 if it breaks. I told them the canister costs less than $30 online. Then the guy at the service desk just refused to serve me and asked me to leave. They did not even finish the work on my car. This is so ridiculous!
If you want to make money, do it in an honest way. Don't bait your customers and scam them.
Save your time and go somewhere else.

update: Their district manager Dan called me after 2 days to apologize and offered free oil change to make it up. At least someone from precision auto tune cares about their reputation and customers.<//text>

Horrible service and a bunch of scammers. Dont fall for their friendly behavior. I should of read the reviews before. They start by charging you for services that dont even do anything. Then they have you come back again and again until they finally do what is needed. But at the end of the day you end of paying 2 x the money for the service your really needed... they know how to get money out of people. That is why this is a no go. Mechanics already have a bad rep. This behavior is unacceptable and we must all find that mechanic we can trust. DONT GO THERE!! Keep looking for a different mechanic. I know I am.</review>

1 day after an oil change, I had leaks and hoses that were deliberately cut.   If they take 3 hours for an oil change, they are messing with your car.  I should have known better than to use a mechanic shop on groupon</text>

I've been a customer here for months now. I appreciate the mechanics here. Because I've become a regular customer, waiting isn't a problem. They offer free WiFi and the waiting room is pretty cozy.
Javier is one of the mechanics there and he's pretty freaking amazing. So far I've brought 2 cars to him and he takes great care of it. He's always giving me tips on what to look out for and always giving me second opinion. He compares his prices to others right in front of me and sends me to other great mechanics that can take care of what he can't.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.< /review>

Amazing experience. Their group-on deal is awesome. $17 for oil change, tire rotation and brake inspection. Not sure how the rest of their prices compare. Treat Javier with respect and he will help you out. Thanks Javier!</Text>

<Review>The price was Okay and the service was okay as well. There reason I made the review 5 starts is that, when they were changing the oil, something broke. They didn't have the original part, so they changed it with something after market. I didn't object to it, but themselves told me they have ordered the original part too, and they changed it out of charge later. (I know you may think it should be the normal procedure, but unfortunately this is not what I have see in auto tuning practice, they try to charge maximum and do minimum lots of time)<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Javier is wonderful and has proven to show his professionalism multiple times. I recently went in to get an oil change (which by the way is the cheapest in the area) and he has warned me of other issues multiple times. He even gave me a list of other needed requirements in which I said I would do on my own. Being very busy, I never got to it. I had several issues with my car and the total cost was too expensive.

He had no intention to sweep my bank account and helped me out with a financial plan to help pay if off. He is a very old fashioned professional (like myself) and we agreed on a payment plan by a handshake of trust. That style shows true care for his customers and doesn't just care about the money in their wallets.

I seriously suggest everyone go to Precision Auto Care for any car related requirements.<//Text>< Rating>

Fast, friendly, top notch service. Even purchased the wrong (conventional) oil change service on Groupon but was still afforded the appropriate discount and service was upgraded to full synthetic for difference in cost, completed in about 40 minutes... easy breezy. Definitely rolling back through for my next service.

Note: don't bother with Groupon, they've already got the same in-house discount for the services offered by Groupon. Save yourself the extra headache.</review>

They fool around with your car if you don't book additional business!

I am now the third person, whom I know it happened to.
After an oil change they wanted to offer a brake pad removal for the front for 175$ and spark plugs exchange (1.3hours) for 225$, with way longer working time than any factory dealer would propose.

So they adjust your tire pressure without asking. Mine was perfect at 32psi all around and after it was 28 left rear and 36 front right and the tire pressure monitor system went on.
Potential additional business for them, but everyone could fix this them self.

Will never go there again, and strongly advise not to use.< /text>< pics>

I have been going there for about 5 years now.
At first cause I lived right down the street. Now I live in downtown San Jose and still go there.
I always receive the best service.
Javier shows me what's going on with the car. What's urgent and what may need to be done in the future. No surprises...</Review>

I normally don't go to shops except in emergencies - I generally like to do most of my auto repair work myself, but sometimes I don't have the time. I've taken my car here twice as the shop is near my house, and both times I've received severely un-satisfactory service. First time was a brake job - needed them to replace front brake lines. Pretty simple but I didn't want to bleed them at home, so I bought in my lines and fluid and asked them to install the lines using the supplied fluid. They did my lines, but didn't use my fluid and charged me for their (probably lower rated) fluid... Also whoever does their brake bleeding should practice BEFORE doing customer cars as the brake feel got worse after upgrading to steel lines from rubber. Second time was just them being lazy - didn't want to align my car "because it is too low" and "it's too much work to get it on the lift" even though I've had it done at multiple shops where my car was also too low, but they put some wood blocks under it for a whopping 15 seconds added to the loading and unloading of the lift. Seem to be more interested in making a quick buck than having return customers. Never taking my business here again. Fooled me once, shame on you; Fooled me twice, shame on me; I'm not getting fooled again.< /review>< user_name>

Not only did the brakes feel worse after servicing, they added on multiple "services" that were extremely random and unnessesary such as a 2 hour spark plug replacement (why the hell?) Oil changes (seriously?) Power steering fluid fees (again why??) Motor oil (dude she just needed brake replacement) fuel injection cleaning (SHE JUST NEEDED BRAKES) air filter replacement (she just got a new one not too long ago the hell??)

Scammers. Overcharge to hell for simple oil change that was advertised to be < $20. Was in for oil change, they charged a lot extra for oil, filter, etc that becomes even more expensive than dealership. Will never visit again.< /text>

<Text>THIS IS A NO ENTRY ZONE. Based on the reviews, i am aware that these guys always oversell but was not aware that these guys will force you to buy their oversell. In short - Take it or Leave it. Though i went through the reviews i had no other option as i had to utilize the groupon coupon that i had already bought. Buying a groupon coupon is a trap. I was ok with the standard oil change for my car as i had done earlier but these guys didn't agree to replace standard oil. They said, they don't do standard oil for my car. It will only be Synthetic oil. Now that i have a groupon coupon and these are the only guys in the city who accept that coupon, i found myself in a trap.</Text>< Response>

<Review>Very very bad service. There is no proper order of taking the service. They just keep us waiting. When we ask why it's taking so long, they have some reason which is not at all acceptable. Very bad service and customer experience. Not at all recommend.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Not only does this facility offer many different kinds of units catered to your specific needs, it is extremely clean and well kept.  Eric the manager who is very friendly, informative, and kind was able to help get me a unit at an affordable cost, and I feel very confident and safe leaving my belongings at this location. I am very happy to be utilizing a unit from this storage facility.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

After her calling around several different places and having to leave messages orangecrest called me back and had one unit left. They are extremely helpful and are so kind and any supplies you need anything you need they have it there and it is not overpriced and make sure you understand everything, no hidden fees. And the best of all o no contracts it's a month to month arrangement
I highly recommend orangecrest self storage<//Review>

Highly recommended! Front the first day I used their facility to the last, I have found the staff to be professional and courteous. The property is very well kept and never saw anything that made me concerned that my belongings would be at risk. Upon my move out, Eric was extremely helpful. He made the experience easy and convenient I would recommend highly to anyone seeking a storage facility to Orangecrest Storage.<//review>

<Review>I had a storage unit here for a few months (temporary move) and this place was great. It was an easy process to get the unit, I actually reserved it online and was able to walk in on move-in day to purchase a lock & was shown the unit within minutes. Every one of the staff I dealt w/ while coming into the office was great and pleasant to work with. They seem to monitor the grounds frequently. I moved out in a rush before the office had opened so I couldn't close my account right then but when I called to close it, they advised they had already seen it was empty and closed out my account, which I appreciate so much. If you need a storage unit, long term or short, this is definitely the place to go. It's also super convenient w/ Dunkin next door! Pre-move fuel lol Thank you Orangecrest Self Storage! I will definitely consider you guys again if I ever need to move out this way again.< /Review><username>Morgan Preston< /username>< Pics>

<review>I don’t really like self storage places, but my positive experience with Orangecrest Self Storage and Eric the manager has changed my mind. Eric has been super helpful in my 2200 mile move across country.

If you’re looking for a storage place, look no further. This is it!<//review></record>

Eric gave me a detailed tour of the place and broke down the pricing and quotes very well. He was polite, professional, and was prioritizing me.. the customer. I got a storage in minutes. Clean and safe environment as well. Very helpful & cheap!< /Review>

Eric is very good at what he does! Customer services is EXCELLENT!!!! I had just made my 2nd stop at a storage place a mile down the road (across from Farmer Boys to be exact😉), and the demeanor I encountered upon walking in was bland, not welcoming at all. When I asked for prices he just handed me a list, and I almost fell over backwards looking at those rates.  But when I walked into Orangecrest, Eric was very friendly and welcoming. He delightfully went over their prices, process, and policies. The rates are unbeatable, and the large facility is very well maintained and clean. He even showed me the storage unit before doing any of the paperwork. I was glad I didn't have to walk out of yet one more storage location, as I had already been to 2 prior to Orangecrest. It was truly a pleasant experience👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟< /text>

I was on the fence about which unit to get and fortunately was told that if the unit i chose was too small, that i can move up to another unit. Which did end up happening! So simple and easy! I can’t express how amazing their customer service is! Id say #1 place in Riverside!</text>< Pics>

My experience with Orangecrest storage was great. Cindy was very helpful and explained everything regarding my new storage unit. It was very clean and had easy access. She took me to the site and made sure it was clean. She was very helpful and had a very pleasant personality. I would definitely recommend this storage. The location was great and it was very easy to get the U Haul in and out. Thank you again Cindy for your help<//Review>

I highly recommend Orangecrest Self Storage! I recently had a storage unit there for about 10 years. Eric runs the facility very well! Everything is well maintained and kept up nicely. The area is always clean, monitored, gated and safe. You can definitely tell that Eric takes great pride in the company! I am thankful that I was able to store my belongings at such a great storage facility!< /review>

<review>I recently got a storage unit from Orangecrest Self Storage and who knew getting a storage unit would be so entertaining.. The manager of the facility Eric was so friendly charming and very funny.. He made what I thought was going to be a bad experience better than I could have ever expected... I had to wait a few minutes while he helped another couple and he was very apologetic.. He helped me with my moving supplies and help me pick out the perfect unit for what I needed.. I brought my son along and he even engaged with him... it was very sweet... I would recommend Orangecrest Self Storage to anyone looking for a storage unit..  They even have a moving truck available.. Thank you for a great experience...</review>< pics>

I moved back to Riverside for a few months, and needed somewhere to store my furniture. I drove by Orangecrest Self Storage nearly every day, as it is located conveniently near where I was living. I found the staff to be very helpful, courteous, and friendly from the moment I stepped in to rent, to the moment I left. Additionally, the property is very clean and secure. I felt safe leaving my belongings, and felt confident they would be well taken care of. I will definitely return if services are needed in the future, and I highly recommend to anyone looking for an easy, safe storage facility!<//review>

I just became a  renter at this facility. The two people I met were above my expectations. This  Facility, I really wish and hope they know how much of an asset Eric and Angelica are. I called Angelica quite a few times in one day and she was very patient and very courteous, especially for me who called like four times.  I  Felt so bad but she put me at ease that it was OK. Although I only met her on the phone she was such a delightful (lack of a better word right now) person to talk to you. When I met Eric the following day I was flabbergasted that I got to work with these two wonderful employees employees, 1 which was the manager over the place,  and acted like he wasn't over anyone.  Number two who is just a normal employee was very now knowledgeable and friendly just like Eric. Eric treats his people very fairly and very good and treats them with dignity. I would consider this place one of the best storage facilities I've ever done business with. With me being a vice President at my last company,  I would hire them In a heartbeat. Thank you so much and you are truly blessed to have these two people work  with your team.  Kudos to your company and this facility.   Being new to the state of California, I really hope I find a job that has this type of people working for them.  I would love to get up in the morning and go to work knowing the people who I work with are pleasurable to work with.

Thanks again,
Sharon D Hennessey<//review>

<Review>I've had Orangecrest Storage for almost eight years now.  I've always gotten good customer service, especially from Eric.    They're always willing to work with you, no matter the circumstances.  That is the big reason why I've remained a customer for so long.  The facility is always clean and accessible.  I would recommend this storage place to anyone, anytime.  Keep up the good work.  Thank you Eric!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Very impressed. Eric definitely knows the meaning of customer service. The facility was clean and secure. Especially like the high ceilings which allows you to store almost twice as much into a small storage.< /Review>

<text>This is a review regarding Orangecrest Self Storage located on Van Buren in Riverside. I always enjoy going to the Storage place because every time I go to pay my monthly bill or to talk payment options the staff is always so nice and so helpful in all my storage needs. No matter what time I go the facility is always clean and always stocked with moving and storage supplies.
I like the convience of having access to my storage unit and the reasonable hours that the Storage is open.
I really appreciate Eric the manager's help with assisting me with payments over the phone or working with me if my monthly payment is going to be late. Eric is truly a peoples person willing to help and assist me with all of our needs and concerns we may have at that time. The best part of this there are no hidden fees the staff always gives us accurate billing amounts. So if you're looking for a good storage facility I recommend going to Orangecrest Self Storage for all your storage and moving needs. We have a history with Orangecrest for over 8 years plus and I highly recommend them. You've tried the rest now try the best Orangecrest Self Storage.
Thank you,

I have been with Orangecrest Self Storage for three years.  There has not been one time that I have even considered changing storage places.  The facility is clean, and the staff is friendly and well trained.  I have had to add and/or change the size of my storage units on a couple of occasions and the manager, Eric, goes out of his way to help me assess the correct size for the items I need to store.  Eric is extremely knowledgeable about the business overall, and I can tell that he truly enjoys the work he does as evidenced in how he treats each customer that comes through the door.  No matter how busy they may be, they make sure that each customer knows that they are just as valued as anybody else.  I am extremely happy that I found Orangecrest Self Storage!<//Text>

<Review>My grandma went back with her husband and they were being rude towards them the whole time. They were being rushed to get everything out. He stood over them and watched them take everything out of their storage. And repeated over and over to “hurry up” and that he “wants to close already.” He was being rude and impatient we do not plan on coming back or recommending this place to anyone. Poor customer service< /Review>< Pictures>

I am writing on behalf of the Woodcrest Christian High School Cross-country team.  Our team engages in an annual fundraiser to fund uniforms, track fees and awards.  Our giant obstacle this year was where to store the ultimate 3000 pair of used shoes we gathered.  The storage manager, Eric, was incredibly helpful and supportive of our efforts.  Though we needed a unit for a short period, he was instrumental in making this year's fundraiser a huge success.  We are very grateful for all his assistance.  Thanks from the entire team members and coaching staff.< /review>

< Review>
Orangecrest Self Storage has been nothing short of perfect for my family's storage needs. My wife called from the U-Haul truck somewhere on I20, as we moved across country from Texas back home to Riverside. We needed a climate controlled storage for our items, and although at the time Orangecrest Self Storage only had a couple of smaller units available, the price was right, and the property manager, Eric Standing, was very pleasant as we spoke. It wasn't enough for all of our stuff, but it helped with the items that had to be climate controlled, while the rest would have to go to another place. Just in passing I told Eric if a larger unit ever came up to "remember us," because it would be more convenient to have the stuff together. Just a few weeks later the phone rang and it was Eric, saying he'd remembered the comment and he had a larger unit coming up if we still wanted it. The larger unit allowed us to move most all of our stuff into a single unit that didn't accumulate dust, and made it easy to come and go as was needed. Between the price and the excellent service, Orangecrest is the only home for our "stuff," when our stuff can't be at home. Thank you, Eric!<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I've rented at multiple storage locations. The managers tend to be very rude and careless. They always had complaints about my speed or the type of trucks i take in there. I happen to have a friend living nearby Orangecrest self storage, i passed by since the stuff i store i use often for work and home. I walk in...... I felt right at home as soon the as the most sincere person i've ever met named (Eric i think) talked to in storage business helped me out. provided me with a cheaper price for my driving inconvenience and gave me exactly what i wanted for less than what i thought. I really do thank him since i feel like my stuff is safe and i feel comfortable not being bothered.

<text>This is the first time I had to use a storage facility and I really didn't know what to expect. I needed to store furniture and other items from a four bedroom home. Stress was hanging around and after spending an hour 1/2 in the 91 EB traffic I finally made it to Orange crest storage. At the office I was greeted by Manager Eric Standings. I gave him my situation. He immediately jumped on the keyboard and worked his magic. It just so happen that a tenant was vacating his large storage room that day and Eric was able to hook me up. He also had a smaller storage rm across from the larger one that was vacant so again I got hooked up. I am able to store all the funiture, clothings, in the rooms.The facility is immaculate. You would think it just recently opened but it's been around. Security with one way in  and one way out thru a keypad passcode is Awesome...Everytime I come to the office it's like hanging out with good friends. Great place Great People.  Thanks Eric for making this transition a verry smooth ride...You Da Man!!!</text>< Rate>

<Text>I don't remember if I bought my mattress from the san jose or the san francisco store. But I can say they are VERY expensive. I bought mines through the mail so I have to pay for the shipping which comes to over $100. The first mattress I bought consisted of natural rubber latex and sheep wool. But when I used it, it was to soft and I sank when I slept on it and I would sometimes wake up with back aches. So months later I called them to complain about this and they gave me the option of getting another mattress that was more firm. But I had to pay the cost difference of the mattress and the shipping. So I had to cough out more money and got the new mattress which is way better than the first one. They told me to keep the first mattress not to return it because of covid 19. So make sure you choose the right firmness of the bed before purchasing and expect to pay a lot for these mattresses. But overall the quality is not bad. 😁</Text><name>T AA<//name></record>

We told Burt, the Sales Manger of the store that we did not know much about futon. He took his time to explain to us and recommended several options for us the choose from. We ended up purchasing a full-size futon sofa/bed. It was delivered to our house today and we loved the style and quality of the sofa. We would recommend everyone who wants to buy  a futon to stop by the San Jose store to chat with Burt. He's one cool and knowledgeable guy.<//text></record>

<review>Came here on Sunday to look at futons - called ahead and the hours on the phone indicated they were open. When we arrived, the store was closed. Found out after chatting on their website that they are appointment only, even though no signage was posted indicating so.
Came here on Monday, after calling the shop verifying someone would be there for the next hour. The person who I talked to on the phone seemed very put out that I wanted to come to their store instead of going to their San Mateo location, and also made sure I knew they were only open for another 52 minutes.
When my husband and I walked in the store 30 minutes before closing, the only employee of the store couldn’t be bothered to look up from his computer or even welcome us. After asking a few questions that were barely answered - and being told again that we should just go to their San Mateo location - we left the store without purchasing anything.
Overall: the customer service was terrible, and I couldn’t even tell you what this store sells other than “futons” - I have no idea what mattress sizes, mattress types, or frames they sell, or any idea about what their pricing model is. Save yourself some time and skip this one.<//review></record>

< Review>
Absolutely the worst customer service I have received. I went to pick up my mattress, the guy probably had a bad day and was excessively rude. In the end ended up giving me wrong items for both product I have purchased. Their web chat customer support was not able to help me after few sessions. Eventually after few calls I had to go back to replace item with correct one. When I rolled the mattress out I realized that the cover they provided for the mattress was the wrong size as well, it's been almost two years and I am still yet to hear from their support on how I can get the correct cover.< /Review>

We are happy with the purchase of our futon and mattress.  We are very happy with the quality and Burt was very helpful in helping us choose the right futon for us. He also went above and beyond in making sure that we get the correct cover we ordered.</text>

What luck to get Burt all to ourselves today! We’re getting a sofa bed and he answered all of our questions about fabric and materials and gave us a demo of how to set it up. Burt is super knowledgeable about other futon shop products, and helped us decide on a bean bag, as well. Burt’s customer service is top notch, as he was able to advise us about stock on hand, delivery dates, and what to expect for the set up day, all with charm and a smile. If you’re in the market for some eco-friendly/organic (or otherwise) furniture, stop by this Futon shop!<//text>

<text>Every time my wife and I shop here, we find the perfect futon mattress.  We drive all the way from Santa Cruz, just to purchase here.  Burt is very knowledgeable about the products and the variety of types and features...he is also gregarious and avuncular.  Fantastic experience.<//text>< name>

<Review>Burt is the expert in the Bay Area. He's been doing this for 20yrs. We needed some parts and he gave us advice on where to look and even hooked us up with some spare parts he had on hand.

He's not just someone selling you something to make money, he really cares about customer satisfaction. I highly recommend coming here if you're working with anything futon related.</Review><user_name>Hunter Casbeer</user_name>< Pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We just had a great experience when we went shopping for a futon. My husband and I knew exactly what we wanted but need some clarification for the mattress selection as well as the frame. We were very kindly greeted and we were given very concise honest feedback regarding prices and quality. It was late afternoon, and we were very glad we made our choice very quickly and left with a futon ordered. I highly recommend this location to anyone who does not know anything about futons/frame and mattresses.<//Text><Date>1380328522562</Date>< response>

< review>
The shopping process was absolutely great!  She spent a lot of time answering our questions and was very helpful in picking out a frame and mattress.  She even steered us to a cheaper mattress model because it was a better fit with what we were looking for.

The ordering process was a bit confusing however.  Their system is quite antiquated and hard to understand.  We ended up double checking the descriptions of what she entered, but eventually we had to just trust it was all correct.

Delivery and setup of the frame and futon was great, but the pillows didn't arrive with the futon.  We were assured they'd be shipped separately.  But a few weeks and phone calls later, the pillows eventually were shipped.  Unfortunately when they arrived, we realized they were incorrect.  A mistake was made when she typed in our order, even though the descriptions were correct.  Once we made them aware of the problem, it took a few more phone calls and they agreed to fix the issue.  However, since the option we thought we ordered was a bit more expensive, they weren't willing to absorb all the cost to fix the mistake.

Overall the shopping experience and setup was great.  However, ordering, follow up, and trying to get mistakes corrected was frustrating.</review>

<Review>We had a great experience at this location. We went in there with a clear idea of what we wanted (specifications, color, etc.) and Robert showed us exactly what we wanted to buy. He explained the pros and cons of each of our choices and didn't just try to sell us the priciest option. We got out of there in less than 45 minutes with the perfect sofa bed on order and to be delivered in less than a week. Thank you Robert for making it such an easy, stress-free experience!</Review>< Rate>

My wife and I went to The Futon Shop looking for a futon on St Patty's Day. We only needed the mattress as we have a good frame. We had a great experience learning about the different quality mattresses and the considerations to keep in mind when making our decision. There was no pressure, just great help. We found the one that best fit our needs and received a call five days later that it had arrived.

This was an easy buying experience for us. We recommend it.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>We visited the Futon Store in San Jose today and the experience was excellent. The person in the store was very patient with us and explained us everything there was to know about Futons. We were new to this, but we left feeling we knew a lot about Futons. He explained us about wall huger frames and we finally decided to buy one since it gives so much flexibility in terms converting to a bed when required without having to move the Futon at all. This was pretty cool !!! Also, he explained us about the various mattress options we had and helped us choose one that would fit us the best based on our exact requirements. He was not pushing to sell the most expensive of mattresses,but the one that suited us the best and this kind of attitude is not something that we see at a typical store, . In short, this was one amazing experience and I would highly recommend everyone to visit these folks if you are looking into buying a Futon. They are good !!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>Knowing the harmful toxic effects of normal mattresses I did not want to go in for another run of the mill off-gassing mattress & thus the search for a cotton futon mattress started that drove me literally crazy!!Finally-The Futon Shop came across as that one stop shop for mostly all that I was looking for - Egyptian cotton & soy foam based natural futon mattresses at affordable prices with no petroleum or synthetic stuff in it & natural fire retardant so you can rest assured you are sleeping on something healthy!!
Their selection is pretty good & they have mattresses to fit every budget.The showroom manager & service was pretty friendly & open to all queries.I am very happy I chose them for such an important purchase & would recommend them to all friends for the great combination of all you would want in a healthy mattress for your family!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808e33c2e01400d7:0x88fee5ff06868af2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Terrible store!  We paid more that $1000 for a wool-wrapped organic cotton futon mattress from The Futon Shop less than a year ago (Mar, 2018, invoice 1353873), and it is horribly dished (depressions of ~4-6 inches).  Supposedly , this futon was a high-end product with an original price of $2000 and it was marked down to "just" $1000.  The San Jose Store, where we purchased it, is ignoring our complaint.  We suppose they think we got a discount and can expect terrible performance.  By comparison, we have owned futon mattresses that were good for up to 8 years.  This is disappointing and expensive!  Avoid this store!</review>

We visited the shop three times in between shopping around other furniture stores in the area. We loved the comfort of the natural sofa beds they have as well as the lineup of the unique sleeper sofas only available at this store/brand. The quality support seems superior and Sheng is very kind in assisting us with various questions. He extended the discount a little longer for us because we needed to come back with the exact measurement of the apartment we are moving into. We're looking forward to the delivery! Thank you Sheng!!</Text>

We were given tons of personal attention and expert information. Robert worked with us to find exactly what we needed and at the best price. Definitely would recommend the Futon Shop in San Jose.<//text>

<review>This review is not about the Futon shop itself. It's a review of one of it's employees. I would rate her a zero star if I had the option. I received the worst customer service ever from Desiree tonight!!!!!! She needs to get some intense customer service training or get fired!!!!! She was very rude and patronizing!!! I am taking my business somewhere else. What happened to all the good employees who people praised about in the previous reviews, please bring them back!!!!<//review><Date>1453864120200< /Date></record></dataset><record>

He was nice and polite and answered all the questions we had. Made us feel at home. Not to mention the pricing is fair and affordable. We are planning to return next week for a Japanese style mattress. I would certainly recommend this place and sheng Luu to family and friends.<//review>< user_id>

<username>William Teeple< /username><review>We had a really great experience at the Futon Shop in South San Jose (Almaden Expressway).  I had done some research early on about the different types of Futon's and how they operate, but it was much clearer and easier to see in the store the operation of the units as well as the different styles and feel for the mattresses.

The staff was very friendly and helped us decide on the best mattress and frame for our specific needs.  We ordered on a Sunday and by Thursday we had the unit, matress and pillows we ordered delivered and they were so fast in setup, that it only took 20 minutes from begginning to end.  Very enthused and happy.

Highly recommend!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Amazed at the great customer service provided by Sheng! I needed a new bed since mine just went in the dumpster due to mold from my drafty room. I had no idea what I was doing or what I was looking for. I just knew I had to get one that I could sleep in and also use to sit and play hours upon hours of video games. Sheng was very patient with me- showing me all the different options, giving suggestions, etc. I asked a lot of questions and he knew all the answers. He was very professional and very personable. He gave me an estimate for 3 weeks in order to get my new futon and it arrived in less than a week! Definitely would recommend going to see Sheng!< /Text><response>None<//response>< pictures>

< Review>
We have been thinking about getting a futon couch for accommodating guest from out of town. I was not sure what the cost would be as I have never gotten one. When we went to the store Sheng was with another customer but greeted us and asked us what we were looking for. When I saw the price tag I was  surprised to see the prices as I they were more expensive than I thought they would be. However, it was Memorial Day weekend and they had very good sales. The organic mattresses looked attractive but they were quite expensive so we went with the standard one.

There are less expensive futon beds out there but the frames are flimsy and the mattresses are not as comfortable. The whole idea of us getting a futon bed is that when guests come over they don't have to sleep on a blow up bed and be comfortable. You get what you pay for.

The wooden frame looks very sturdy and easy to pull out. We had three different choices on color for the frame and we got the black walnut. All of their mattresses and covers are made to order (in SF) so keep in mind there could be 2 to 3 week lead time. It is quite impressive the different fabrics and color you get to choose from for the cover.

We got the standard mattress type and the medium level collection. Sheng helped us pick the right mattress based on the usage. Since they make their own mattresses if your mattress goes bad you can replace it. They do have a 7-year limited warranty though. Or if you want to change the color of the cover you can always purchase a new one.
We had picked a very light cream color but Sheng was kind enough to suggest a darker tint and we got the khaki.

He also mentioned that we should get the rubber pad as you will need it to stop the mattress from slipping. He was very honest with us and said that we can get it for cheaper at Walmart next door as all you have to do is cut it to size. We appreciated the fact that he was straightforward with us but for the price difference, time and effort, it just made sense to get it from them.

The delivery is $70 and only $40 for assembly. We got a queen size futon bed for $1158 including delivery and assembly. Since they have the bed frame in stock, we are getting the futon bed in less than a week. I highly recommend shopping at the Futon Shop if you are looking for quality futon beds.<//Review>

We got our futon here after looking around at other places.
Desiree was very helpful, and made it easy for us to make up our minds
after she explained different products and prices.< /Review>

I am moving into a new apartment, and Miguel, the sales person, helped me with any inquiries I had. He was also very friendly and professional. In addition, he showed me pictures of some furnitures that were not in the store, so I ended up buying the sofa bed sleepers, and the matrix convertible chair that matches the sofa with a very good deal.<//text>

<Text>The last Baja Fresh in the region that I know of.  Has not changed much, of course in a good way!
But let the record show its in Orangevale, not Folsom.  No idea why it says Folsom.< /Text><user_id>113908398834176702132< /user_id><Date>1611095880889</Date><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

This one is clearly mismanaged and dragging down the brand. They seem to get decent reviews during lunch hour. Maybe just operate the store between 11 and 2?</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I came in to order a wahoo taco and a chicken burrito mexicano. There was only one guy running the place and he told me that they were out of the wahoo tacos and so then instead of that, I decided to get the chicken taco. The chicken was absolutely dry and flavorless and the taco didn't even have any onions on it. And then the burrito mexicano had no cilantro or salsa in it and they didn't even ask if I wanted hot or mild salsa on my burrito. Every Baja I have been to before this puts salsa and cilantro in the burrito and they put onions on the tacos as well. The chicken is also usually more flavorful. The chips were also kind of stale. This Baja is not like any of the other Baja fresh restaurants that I've been to. They also had a small selection of salsas in the salsa bar. They did not have any of those yellow peppers or any jalapeños.</Review>< pics>

<Review>I placed an order for pickup over the phone, then was told that I could “come in and order if I wanted” but had to explain that I didn’t have the time and was calling so my food was ready when I got there, no biggie. I then arrived 15 minutes later at the gas station/waiting room/ ice cream/ Baja Fresh store.. the weirdest layout of a restaurant/gas station I’ve ever seen. The Baja Fresh looks shut down. There was 1 Baja Fresh employee working but the restaurant half of the store was completely vacant. I had to pay at the gas station counter and got the wrong order given to me. I was the only customer in the restaurant so I was a little confused how they could have messed that up. I would avoid this place at all costs. Honestly looked like it needed to be shut down.<//Review>< gmap_id>

When I call to order my food they frequently do not answer the phone. The few times they do the girl has a rude tone of voice. She doesn’t even let me finish my order and she hangs up without even saying , “Is there anything else? or thank you.” If I did not like the food so much I would have stopped coming here a long time ago. I always dread having to deal with the poor service every time I come. I wish the owner would hire friendly, respectful people to work there. Gloria is awesome, but she is rarely there because she is usually working in the Elk Grove restaurant.<//Review>

Dirty. The whole place was filthy. Worker was on his phone while taking my order. The food was over cooked, rice and beans were dry as hell. I would expect this from a location in South sac. Or Del Paso Heights.<//review>

I gave it to because I love the food. But honestly it deserves a 1.
On multiple occasions I have gone to this establishment only to find that it is closed. On another occasion I called to place an order on the phone, only to be placed on hold for over 30 minutes.I took that time to just drive down while still on hold, only to walk in and have the lady say that she never answered the phone and has no idea what I'm talking about. On top of that she claimed they didn't have any food to make my food.
This happens almost every time I go there.one in five times that I've ever gone have they been open when they say they're supposed to.
Don't waste your time driving there, call first!! They might not even be open.
Tonight was the final straw.I called to place my order an hour ahead of time before they were going to close. No one picked up until the 4th call. (I'm seriously not driving there until I know they're open, it's far.) When he answered asking how he can help, I asked to place an order. when he didn't answer, I asked if they were even open. He went on to say that they weren't. And I asked why, to which he replied for maintenance. I said what kind of maintenance? To get back "general". I hung up.
I'm so done with this place I swear. I'll drive to Elk Grove for Baja if I have to.

**Update: I've gone back once and no problems. Went today at 4:30.... closed for "maintenance"...again. This place sure has a lot of store closing maintenance. ALWAYS CALL AHEAD!< /Text>

Folsom/ Auburn location is very disappointing! This is my 3rd visit within the last 3 weeks, first visit they served a customer then told me they were closed for cleaning, 2nd visit no lettuce for a salad, 3rd visit only serving chicken tacos nothing else!!! Customer services is the worst, not friendly and very short in communicating with customers! DO NOT RECOMMEND!< /text>

<Text>I was simply going to ignore this experience and chalk it up to learning, but two days later the gas station service was even worse. SO, I strongly encourage you to take your business elsewhere and don’t put a single dollar in the owners pocket!

I went for a quick burrito. Baja Fresh is usually pretty good so I thought I was safe. My first clue should have been that, even though 30-mins from closing, all the chairs were upside down on the tables... I finally found the clerk hiding behind the counter on her phone and asked if they were open. Her response “unfortunately”, that was clue #2... being hungry, I ordered anyway. It was the WORST burrito I’ve EVER had. Lots of lettuce, a few very old grilled onions & peppers, a sprinkling of chicken and probably 10 black beans... THATS IT! No sauce, no salsa, nothing. To top it off, the lettuce was old and the whole thing tasted sour. I was afraid of getting sick so I had to throw it away. ABSOLUTE WASTE OF $10! AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!<//Text>< pics>

Could have saved ourselves a trip if we'd just looked at the reviews beforehand. From the outside, looks promising even though it is attached to a gas station. Ample area to eat, nice umbrellas and shade. Inside, the "salsa" bar looked filled, clean and presentable. We are a family of 6 and came in Sunday evening around 6pm. Place is empty except for 1 customer completing payment for a dine in ahead of us. The cashier, sighed when she saw us and that's when we noticed she was completely alone and from the looks we received from her, we clearly got the message that we were going to cause her a lot of work and the food would not be up to par so we left.< /text>

The impression I got was, " if this is a restaurant
Chain, if feels like they're  waiting to be bought my a larger company.  That's not necessarily a bad thing. But if just feels unfinished.
But the food was decent.
I would probably never actually seek out this place for food, but if it was convenient I would eat here again.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x809ae3d89f709e03:0x6291f88f3d614178< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Jameisha forgot to put beans on my tostada. My favorite part, and I didn’t notice til I got home. On top of that she was pretty rude when taking my order and when I asked for chips</text>

This is a good Baja Fresh. It's a smaller one, and connected to a gas station, but the food is better here than the typical Baja Fresh (I am already a fan of Baja Fresh food). Seems like two brothers or friends run the place and they put a bit of extra quality and imagination into the already good Baja Fresh food.</review>

Rude disrespectful employees, half of the things you order cant be fulfilled due to lack of products i guess. Kids meal corn was ice cold while other kids meal was warmed. Very disappointed. I love baja fresh just not this one.<//review>

We ordered food for over 100 people for an event. Baja Fresh Folsom showed up over 3 hours late. When I called and emailed with follow up we received no response. Since my event was ruined by the absence of food and my organization was very unimpressed with the follow up we do not recommend working with Baja Fresh Folsom for events.</text>

Did not expect this place to be connected to a gas station. No ice at fountain and the one employee suggested we go into the gas station for ice in our drink. 1 hour before cosing and all chairs were already put up on tables.< /text>

<review>Stood in line the other day for 10-15 minutes not because it was busy, but because lack of staff only to be told taco Tuesday is no more.. also seriously the worst bland burritos, much better at other fast food Mexican, also and very expensive.. and also worst Baja Fresh for their salsa bar, it's always empty!!< /review>< pics>

Decent food. A touch above Taco bell. If you have a coupon it's worth the trip. The food is hit and miss though from a cooking perspective though. Sometimes it's a bit overcooked, just depends on Who's on the grill</review>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>This is the worst Baja fresh ever, I was traveling from UTAH and I absolutely LOVE Baja fresh this was the first location we found on the way, BIG MISTAKE.  The place looked unsanitary we ordered any way because we wanted the food so bad SECOND BIG MISTAKE, I was given expired food and the employees looked angry since we entered the place.  I almost wanted to call the health department, they should change there name or be shut down. I ordered a Baja burrito enchilada style as soon as I took a bite I knew something was expired when I gave it back to the cashier she said to me "I think it might be the salsa on top" she knew it was expired and still served it to me.  My mother ordered a Mexican burrito and the cashier said I already tried making it 3 times and it keep breaking and told my mom if she wanted it any ways I then told her we just wanted our money back and she said I should ony be giving you the money back for 2 orders, I worked for Baja fresh for many years I would have given the customer back all of there money back regardless...DON'T COME TO THIS PLACE IT'S DISCUSTING AND UNSANITARY.  I was very disappointed..... if there was an option of giving this place a 0 I would.</Review>< user_id>

First time here probably last time came in for a gel manicure in holographic color the manicurist I had seemed like she never done this color type before because she kept asking her coworkers something about it but proceeded to do it either way, I also came during my lunch time so had no other choice but to stay for the price I would go elsewhere for $45. the black polish that was placed underneath first was showing right away very disappointed with all then good reviews I seen beforehand.

Update: So the owner Tammy reached out and resolved my issue she went ahead and redid my gel manicure she did an amazing job I will definitely be coming back to her only 😊< /review>

I went to luxury nails yesterday for the first time. I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the salon. My technician was Tami who had worked in that business for 18 years. She was very professional and did a great job on my full set. They have several services including approx 5 selections of pedicures. I was very impressed. They r now my new nail salon. Can’t wait to get an impressive pedicure.</review>

<date>1609804444995< /date><Review>I really don't like using gel or any chemicals on my nails for that matter but my regular n personal nail tech is out of the country currently.  I actually get a new kind of nail process on my 💅called gelX nails 💅... it's absolutely beautiful gorgeous n they last guaranteed 4 to 6 weeks. No fill ins. New set every visit...however, I went to this place n already 2 days later they are popping off. Nails were 80.00 n feet were 40 altogether 120.00 n then a 10.00 tip. 5.00 for each service.  I'm hotttttttt as a firecrackers 🧨🤪 right ✅ now so I'm being nice with 3 darn stars...STRAIGHT FROM TINA MISS 42 N STEADY MOVING...F.A.M.E CHECK ME OUT</Review></record>

Great experience, worth the brief wait. Great attention to detail. I love a salon that listens to what you want. Great variety of gel and dipping powders.< /Review>

Mina did my natural nail powder dip. I didn’t like the actual design but I didn’t communicate my vision well. She did an excellent job with the work. The thickness is perfect, she kept my nail length and shape exactly how I wanted. I highly recommend her!!

Luna (not sure if that’s her name) did my sister’s natural nail gel manicure. The outcome was excellent. Highly recommend!!

We called and made an appointment. I was seen within 10 minutes. My sister had to wait 1 hour to be seen. That was the worse part. The prices were fair. We will definitely be back.</Text>

I came here because there were good reviews however when I entered I was turned away because they had too many people. I was not offered to come at a later time or asked to wait a little instead they simply refused to take me in. Pretty interesting considering there’s a sign at the front of their store stating “Walk-in’s welcome” but obviously they’re not.</Text>

Hated this place. They literally scrubbed my skin off of my feet. I paid for the top notch pedicure too. (50.00 dollars)
My feet were bleeding in my shoes.
NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!
Got a full set of nails done and they are so bubbly looking. (40.00) I won't ever go back.</Review>

<Review>Terrible. I was rushed through and they spent a total of 15 minutes on my pedicure, even after asking for a longer massage (I wish I made a dollar a minute). The ironic thing was the shop was empty with no other customers waiting. The actual paint job was also terrible. I was very disappointed and will never return.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I had a VERY positive experience at Hayashida - got what I hoped for and more. The physical therapy and exercises Christopher gave me are helping already. He was thorough, knowledgable, professional and very committed to helping me. Bravo!<//Text>

Very friendly staff from the front desk to the therapists.
The downtown facility is very clean and safe feeling with serious covid protocols being enforced. The open space of the studio is very comfortable.
Chris has been an amazing help in my rehab and very communicative.
I appreciate how he listens and adapts my treatment to my current condition rather than following some pre determined treatment.
I'm very impressed with everyones professionalism and highly recommend Hayashida & Associates< /review>

To be fair, This could have been a lack of protocols given to the therapists, but the therapist I have been working with at Hyashida, post total shoulder replacement is a game changer. 2 stage goals; mobility then strengthening are well underway.

The staff roles from check-in to therapy to physician communication are seamless and show exceptional thought and planning.  I have never had to say anything twice.  How rare is that?  I had a difficult program (rotator cuff) and was completely perfectly and sympathetically supported by a fine therapist with specific and exacting goals.  And no marketing at all.  What a relief.

Best PT experience I've had. Dr Fong is the bomb, zeros in on pain source and in my case it was alleviated in just a few sessions. Highly recommend the professionality of this therapy team, covid protocols and cleanliness of the facility. Also the video demos of the exercises prescribed was extremely helpful.</Text>

THIS IS CURRENTLY MY SECOND EXPERIENCE WITH HAYASHIDA & ASSOCIATES IN 2 YEARS! IT IS THE BEST PHYSICAL REHAB EXPERIENCE ONE COULD HAVE. CARING DOCTORS, WHO ARE BOTH PROFESSIONAL AND PLAN EACH SESSION WITH WHERE A PATIENT IS IN HIS OR HER PHYSICAL HEALING. FRIENDLY DESK STAFF AS WELL. IT GIVES ONE CONFIDENCE THAT THE PAIN WILL BE HEALED IN THE BEST WAY. THE DOCTOR(DR. KIM IN THIS CASE) HONORS THE PATIENT'S PAINS DUE TO HIS OR HER BROKEN BONES AND IS ALWAYS ENCOURAGING.< /Text>

Amazing and extremely knowledgeable personnel helping me through my tough times with this surgery I had! Wow! After my first session of physical therapy  I left with my arm out of the sling; feeling very comfortable and slightly moving it around with minimal pain.  I am able to notice the difference every single time After my therapy sessions. Always leaving with more knowledge on how to speed up my recovery And of course my movements extremely improving! I will own this knowledge for the rest of my life! I am Very happy to be a patient here. Thank you all for your help! Highly recommended by me!< /Text>

<Review>After a recent injury,  I was referred to a different PT facility,  well long story short that facility was not williling to accommodate the hours I was available.  Fast forward enter Hayashida & Associates.  The staff there is very welcoming, knowledgeable and friendly.  I have dealt with Dr Chris and I absolutely love him. He is funny, listens to what I am telling him and my pain level etc. Also have had a few interactions with Brandon and Daniel. The facility is clean and wide open. The ONLY downside is parking.</Review>< rating>

I had hip replacement surgery and have received outpatient physical therapy at Hayashida & Associates. My physical therapist, Annick Lamb, has been exceptional in giving me excercises that are healing and strengthening. I see the progress every session. Annick explains the specific area each excercise addresses and always checks with me regarding pain. All of the staff I have come in contact with are efficient and pleasant. The facility is neat and clean. I am very pleased with my experience here.</Review>

The therapists here are knowledgeable and personable. My PT, Jon, figured out what was causing chronic pain in my leg and numbness in my leg. Parking can be a little crazy during certain times of the year because they share their lot with a number of businesses but look for the three reserved spaces in front of the office before driving around. There is a reason everyone gets referred here.</text>

< Review>
I went to Hayashida for pain relief from a congenital disease in the neck.  My physical therapist Ted, is AMAZE BALLS. He is super professional and considerate. He knows exactly what he's doing and helped me  relieve my pain and strengthened my neck and shoulders. I really appreciated his kindness and patience (especially on my "I don't feel like doing this today" days) Over all, Ted and Hayashida are great and I recommend them to anyone who needs this kind of treatment.< /Review>

<text>I had a herniated disc that was causing pain the stiffness in my back. After consulting my neurologist he suggested Hayashida. It did help and gave me great exercises to do at home complete with a phone app to follow , awesome. Excellent therapists, attentive,  professional, on time, I would reccomend.  I did ultimately go for surgery because of the nature of my condition , I will return for further therapy after I heal. Thank you Annick.< /text>< user_name>

Hayashida Physical Therapy has been outstanding in all ways. They are personable,  efficient, do work thoroughly and are excellent listeners for any extra issues that might need to be addressed . They get my highest rating and recommended them without reservation.</review>

I have visited Hayashida and Associates for various aches, pains and  injuries over the years. I'm 71, a physician and opinionated!
I have always found the practice to be accurate in diagnosis, successful in therapy and organized. I have the highest regard for all that they do.
Thanks for keeping me moving.<//review>

Excellent in all regards: Specific analysis of musculoskeletal problems;  careful range-of-motion stretching; muscle therapy for affected area/s;  prescribing and illustrating specific muscle and joint exercises; thorough follow-up and follow-through with additional or reduced therapy as needed.  Wow!< /review>

< Review>
I live in the Midwest and have been spending one month in Santa Barbara.  I have recently been diagnosed with an arthritic hip and did not want to delay physical therapy until I returned home in March.  Hayashida & Associates worked quickly and efficiently with my health care provider and with my health insurance company to arrange physical therapy in a timely manner.  I was very impressed with how they accommodated me as an out-of-town client.  My treatment by Jon Sakota was exceptional.  Complications arose immediately because of acute pain I was experiencing.  Jon listened carefully to my concerns and observed me carefully and saw that I needed to see a specialist before proceeding with therapy.  Jon referred me to a local orthopedist, who saw me the next day to address the issue of my pain.  I cannot say enough positive things about the help I received from Jon Sakota.  I was so fortunate to be able to work with him.  I highly recommend Jon as a skilled and empathetic physical therapist.<//Review>

I have endured five running injuries in recent years including knee, hamstring, and hip which I thought might end my 49 years of regular runs.  Each time I was treated by Hayashida therapists and could return to consistent running.  Hayashida prescribed exercises have prevented the same problem to recur.  I highly recommend Hayashida & Associates Physical Therapy for any sports injury.</Text>

I couldn't be more pleased with my experience at Hayashida PT, and with my "hero" there, Jason.  I was referred there through my doctor and insurance to treat intense tingling and some pain in my left arm.  About 10 years ago, before moving to Santa Barbara,  I experienced pain in my right shoulder and pectoral muscle,  which was ascribed [via MRI/X-ray examination] to cervical stenosis [i.e. deterioration of the spine at the neck].  While PT solved that immediate problem,  the doctor warned that the long term prognosis was for more serious problems.  So I was pessimistic that the tingling could be due to a pinched nerve at the neck and would require surgery,  something I dreaded,  given my understanding that surgery on the spine can go awry.  Jason reassured me that there was a good probability that stretching and loosening the neck joints [via his manipulation of the neck and assigned exercises] could solve the problem,  and it did!
Further,  the facility on Anacapa St. is pleasant,  quieter and more organized than  some other PT operations I've used over the years.<//review>

The restaurant has a very nice and quiet ambiance, the food is great, and the food is cheap! It will fit your budget eating healthy and having that right amount of protein and meat in your body. If you're looking for a great place this winter season, I am highly recommending this place. If you are also looking for very nice customer service, don't look away anymore.

Boba? Snacks — popcorn chicken, calamari, fried tofu, chicken wings, etc — Beer? Group place? Go here and you won't regret it!< /review><user_id>105688409241923898965< /user_id><Time>1546657588865</Time></record></dataset><record>

I'm a big fan of Blazin Hotpot & Boba Tea ! I like it way better than Boiling point. The pricing and quality of meat is much better. The broth is more flavorful and I won't get super thirsty afterwards.</text>

<Text>This was a late night find, and it was a good one! Several broth selections and they will top up your broth for free as you eat. Oh and the caramel sweet milk boba tea is mofooo bomb! Found out they have a location in Richmond, BC Canada, so I will be going next time I'm in Van. Staff was friendly, and service was very good.

I had the Taiwanese satay broth with rib eye meet, a trio of fried tofu, fries and zucchini. I also got to try the taiwanese sausage and peach tea with boba. Everything was spectacular. The broth was perfect and veggies were fresh. I ordered my tea less sweet and loved it. Great service and atmosphere.</review>

<Review>I have to admit after the few recent times I've come here I have become disappointed with this place. The price hike was understandable but when it includes lower portions is when I have to stop coming here. The rice became half a bowl of rice, the soup barely even reached a quarter of the bowl and the staff.....these new staff that have been working here are just moody teens. They've been so rude and they don't know customer service. It's like every extra order is such a hassle for them to tap on a tablet. Today was sadly my last time coming here as for the first time ever, I left this place still hungry because of the smaller portions.</Review>< pics>

Could have used more plates, sauces and service needs major improvement. I saw the person touching the food before serving, (not a big deal since it is hotpot but) shouldn't do it in front of customer. Drinks did not come out until finished eating. Other customers who came after us received their drinks before their food. No check up on table if things were going okay or not. Had to call out for every single aspect (checks, drink order check, etc.) Food tasted good so hope they improve<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

They offer 6 different broths.  I tried the Viet sweet and sour with chicken. It was soo good.  The fried tofu appetizer was terrific. The hot pots are individual pots. The hot pot price depends on your meat selection. $13 -$20. It would have received five stars, but the restaurant needs a good cleaning.</review>

Has the hotspot warmers built into the table so each person at the table gets their own, very cool. We had a number of different things here and the worst one was pretty much fabulous so if I was close by I would probably be eating here at least once a day. Why have something like in and out burger when you can have a place like this?<//review>

Wonderful hot pot place with very reasonable prices. We went several times as a group. Everyone gets their own soup flavor and then we mix and match the meat/fish. We also tried several of the Boba teas, and they were all delicious. Green milk tea with Boba is definitely my favorite.<//Review>

Just went back and the new owner really changed this place for the better! Her family recipes are great. The handmade dumplings, kimchi and eggrolls were fantastic! Will definitely be returning!!!!!</review>

I cannot recommend another Anaheim restaurant more strongly for anyone who wants to try something new and isn't a rube.<//Review>< Pictures>

Could be a little understand of the slight neglect due to it being on a very busy Saturday. Food made up for it.  Keep up the good job and excellent food. Will recommend to all you foodies out there. Give it a try if you haven't. You won't regret it.<//Review><Date>1479955213304</Date></record>

They've been under new ownership recently and are moving towards a more healthy route which I could appreciate. But the problem is that I did not care for the food. I was excited to try the Taiwanese satay broth, but it was spicy so had to pass on that. Tried the tonkatsu broth, it was okay - nothing amazing. The vegetables that came out looked old and wilty.  Several sauces were listed on the menu but they only had two. The brown one was NOT sesame - I did not like. The other sauce was okay, but overall pretty forgettable.

My biggest gripe about this place is the ventilation. The smoke/oil or whatever from the kitchen and the hotpots made our eyes kind of sting. And when I got home I realized that my hair, my bag, and my clothes smelled! Now I'm used to some smokey smell in my clothes from kbbq, but let me tell you..this was by far much worse. I ended up washing my clothes several times and waiting days for the smell to finally dissipate. It was awful.

Thankfully the experience was not all bad. I did like the meat. Also had no problem with the service; the owner lady even gave us some complimentary taro fries (seasoned with salt and pepper) which were pretty good. I have to say it was a nice way to end the meal. But unfortunately, I will not be back.<//text>< pics>

<review>I usually get the tom yum hotpot. With so many ayce hotpot places popping up, this place is kind of lacking. The portion size is small so you have to order more toppings to get full. For the price I rather go to ayce hotpot place like shabuya or broth 🤷‍♀️</review><user_id>118096642723384203675< /user_id>< pictures>

<Response>None< /Response><text>We ordered popcorn chicken for appetizer.
It was dry.The chicken pieces are cut too small.
It also lack the proper seasoning of Taiwanese popcorn chicken.
They gave you a sweet dipping sauce for the popcorn chicken.
Not authentic at all.

For the shabu, you pick a soup base, then the protein you like.
We both picked Taiwanese Satay soup base with ribeye steak.
The soup base tastes a bit like Boiling Point’s beef pot soup.
The meat was decent quality, and they gave you a lot of veggies.
The hot pot wasn’t too bad, but it wasn’t all that great either.
It’s the type of food that you can get full on, but nothing too special about it.

There were 2 waitress working that night.
The restaurant wasn’t busy at all.
The waitress were both really nice and friendly.
But service was extremely slow.
We had to wait for a very long time for the food.
Then had to wait for a very long time for the check.

This restaurant was just ok.
We probably won’t be back again.
Boiling Point is much better.< /text></record>

<Response>None<//Response><review>Have been here multiple times in the past month. Tried to get a new phone for me and the wife since it 18month lease deal expired. Long story short - manager went out of his way to get us the phones we wanted but our data plans got changed even though they ensured us it wouldn't and we've been fighting with Sprint customer service ever since to try and fix it. Associates at the store are nice and helpful, Sprint still sucks as a provider.< /review>< Rating>

<Text>DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE! I took a phone to have it fixed and the store manager Alden was extremely rude while we were there. We were told the phone worked and we could leave. The phone is still not working so I called and spoke to Alden to see if they needed to do something else. He said no, it wasn't his problem. He is very rude. Still have a broken phone after being there for an hour.< /Text>< pictures>

I don't remember the person's name but he was very helpful. He printed out my bill which I requested. Very helpful and the store is very clean and organized. Since this store is close to my work and home, my next phone purchase will be at this store.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I'm not one to leave a review on things or let alone people but i feel like this deserves one. Walked in and they were busy as there were only 2 people working plus they were already dealing with a difficult customer who was not making things easy on them. Not a problem. I am happy to wait. Then i met Joshua. Josh was so patient with me as I was very unconcerned of what i wanted to do and could not make up my mind. I came in wondering if he could help fix my current phone and ended up getting a brand new one. If it wasn't for the kindness and knowledge of Josh I would have continued on with my day. He was so helpful and determined to help me. He took the time to check my account to see if i was eligible for an upgrade and found out I even had an extra credit available towards my new phone. He took his time and did things right. He never pushed selling me anything until i was ready. He was so personable and so easy to talk to. Made the whole experience feel like i was just hanging with some old friends. I have left many sprint stores because of the customer service but Josh changes the ball game. He was very sweet with other customers who walked in but still took the time to continue to help me. Thank you so much Josh! You are the best!< /Review>< pictures>

I went to this store yesterday and it was the best cuatcust service I have received in a long time. Everyone seemed eager to help and were patient and kind. The store manager William came up to me before I left and asked me if all my needs were taken care of and I could truly say they were.</Review>

Davion and Carson we're very helpful helping me pick a phone and very patient with me transferring my data, which was a lot, to the new phone. Let their satisfied however I needed some extra help with some functions of the phone so I went back a couple of days later and they were both there ,fortunately, and they helped me out with my issues again being very patient and nice as it took 20 minutes to deal with.  I'm sure that's not the last they will see of me ,lol, but I feel I can go in any time and get great service even for small technical things.<//Review>< pics>

Service here was excellent. They were all very polite and professional. My camera had stopped working on my phone, but I didn't know they didn't have phone techs here so it turned out to be a wasted trip. It would be helpful if they prefaced things that could be a hardware issue with, "I can look at it but we don't have technicians here if it turns out to be a hardware issue.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dd27246fb98d25:0x2d2e57c6ab89be73</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I have been a Sprint customer for nearly twenty years, and I have never had the customer service I did at this Sprint store. Daveon the sales rep was excellent. He was informative and efficient, and did more than any other sales associate ever has. After I received my new phones with everything transferred, this never happens at the F.V. store, I had to take my phone back within the hour due to a forgotten pass code. Will, the manager, was able to immediately rectify the problem. Jesus was also friendly and helpful.  I have always been on the fence in regards to staying with Sprint, but this store and its employees will keep me as a Sprint customer:) Thanks guys for everything!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dd27246fb98d25:0x2d2e57c6ab89be73< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This Sprint location needs to be recognized for there OUTSTANDING customer service. I walked in on a Saturday evening, it was completely empty inside so I had amazing customer service from all three representatives.  A big shout of to Darion, Eli, and the manager Will for helping me upgrade my phone!!! I mean they really went above and beyond keeping me occupied I was there for probably 2 hours waiting for my old phone to transfer the millions of pictures I had to the new upgraded phone. In that time frame I had amazing conversation with all three sales reps who are all very kind and down to earth!!! They recommended some good spots to eat locally, any questions I had about my billing they answered on the spot, they kept me aware of my free Hulu I get being a customer with sprint! Wow!! And they helped me add on a iPad for an additional $30 a month with a promotion that was going on.. unfortunately for the person I bought the iPad for was very ungrateful so here I am returning it 1 hour later. As embarrassed as I was to come back an hour later and return it after having such great customer service from them, they returned it with no judgement!! This location is definitely my home sprint location from now on! If you value customer service go to this location and talk to these experts! This location is very clean and tidy, the AC feels amazing and they play good background music as well! :) THANK YOU DARION, WILL, and ELI!!! Your customer service and kindness is very appreciated!!!<//review>

Horrible customer service. Clearly you need more than one person working this location. When asked about how much longer to wait to be helped, the guy didn't even answer us. Just gave us a look.< /review>

After a long 8 hour drive from Reno to LA, we stopped by this Nepali restaurant to grab lunch. It had been a while since I ate momos so I was really excited. They had nice outdoor seating area. We ordered Chicken momo, chicken chowmein, chili chicken and thukpa. The gentleman working there recommended us to try their famous ‘Yak Chili’. At first I wasn’t sure how Yak meat tasted like but I really wanted to try it.

Everything we tried was absolutely tasty but honestly the Yak Chili was the BESTTTT! The taste of the meat and spices were a perfect blend sautéed with crispy onions, bell pepper and you get a really nice taste of the garlic and ginger as well. We stopped by this place again before we headed back to Reno. 100% recommend trying it.<//text>

I can’t tell you guys how much I love this place.
Our server was super nice and friendly.
We visited last night coz we were craving some momos.
We ordered chicken and veg thukpa, chicken and veg momos, chicken thaali and coz my friend she eats no spices and no barely any salt, so they made for her a special veggie item, which  she did like.
It looks like a family owned restaurant and the people were super nice.
We ended up ordering 2 more plates of chicken momos and I ordered 2 more to go, their  momos were so good..
I’m certainly going there again soon.</review>

<Text>Extremely overpriced food. Ordered 2 rice platter and received a portion only enough for one serving. Definitely not worth $50. Asked for extra chicken gravy and was charged $5 but didn’t receive any. Kwati soup was so tasteless and disgusting every Nepali will be ashamed for its misrepresentation.
In fact if you are looking for authentic Nepali this ain’t it. Never again.<//Text><response>None<//response>< Rating>

<review>The food at this restaurant is great, and if we had stayed for a longer time, we would have returned again and again. The service was exceptional! The wine was also to die for, and the staff were welcoming, courteous, and attentive to our needs at the restaurant. Whenever I am in this part of town, I will go there!</review>< pics>

<Review>Great service. The sauces of the masala and the korma seemed similar. Tasty. The yak chili meat was tough and chewy. Hmmm. We'll still go back again because I like the owners!</Review>< Name>

Inexplicably small quaint quiet coffee shop that punches above its weight class with exceptionally great dishes.  While the exterior seems to portray a cute trendy coffee shop the food is what delivers.  The coffee was okay, but the omelette and quesadilla were truly something you've got to try.  From the way they present the food with a multitude of colors, the layering of the quesadilla on top of a bed of spinach, the crust of the tortilla to crispy perfection they nailed it.  Loved the presentation of the omelette with the sliced avocados ( I don't even like avocados)to the pairing of fruit.  They did a remarkable job with the flavor, temp and all around presentation of the dishes.  You can tell that they really put the care into preparing the dish.  Now, the prices are steep, the coffee was okay, and the location is a little tough to find parking, but once you take that first bite you will know what the ratings represent.  This place is the real deal and as much as I wanted to get a really good cup of coffee I came away thoroughly by the food.. kudos to Tickly Tree!< /review>

After reading the previous reviews, my husband and I decided to come here and we were so happy we did so. All seemed to have a place and everyone noticed the attention to detail. In terms of meat cutting, presentation, taste, and quality of meat, this position ranks high. They have a wide variety of wines, cigars, and drinks on show to choose from. All of the explanations for food, view, and service are<//review>

I am shocked this restaurant has 4.3 rating.
Me and my friends literally waited for 1 and half hour to get our order. Honestly it was frustrating to just look at the portion of a food. I would love a refund for my time.<//review>

Outstanding restaurant assistance and food! This was the first time I visited this place with my family. We were totally grateful that we turned to this restaurant for this holiday. They have an impressive interior from the outside until the inside part! A five-stars satisfaction rating all the way for this place. Kudos!</Review>

I’m blessed right now. This amazing restaurant near my house was lit. They made my day a lot of special and momentous. Also, they’ve got a nice place that brought so much happiness deep within my heart. The waiters were kind and decent at doing their jobs. As they served all the foods and beverages that I ordered from their organized menu, I felt the excitement to eat. All of it tastes good. I’ll never forget how much they served me well.<//review>

If you are looking for a Nepali, Indian and Tibetan dishes you should probably come here. Staff are amazing, always welcomes you with open heart. The food portion are perfect and reasonable price as well. They are open for dine in at the patio which gives a different vibe. One of my favorite restaurant in the town. Even during this difficult time they are open just to serve us scrumptious Nepali, Indian cuisine. Thank you for your service.<//text>

Authentic Tibetan  chicken momo’s, including yummylicious sauce. They got best momo’s, traditional thukpa, traditional thali( good for 1 person). Must try this place, you got lot’s of veg options but veg momo’s are not that great. Mention your spice level, its nice hot. Staff is great and we were lucky to see owner who cooked few authentic dishes for us, nice family operated joint. Try it out !< /Review>

On my weekly rotation.  Their jjajangmyun, jampong, the peking chicken, the sweet and sour shrimp, the jumbo dumplings. All so good. One of the best Chinese Korean places! Can't go wrong!< /Text>

1. Khasi Ko Masu - flavors were good but it was mostly bones, some cartilage, and very little meat
2. Aloo Bodi - ordered 5/10 spiciness and it was almost inedibly spicy and overpowered with garlic so could only eat a couple spoonfuls
3. When they say it'll be ready in 40 minutes, they mean 60-70 minutes.  Just so you know.<//text>< gmap_id>

Great food. The Yak Chili has multiple "hotness" levels so, be wise. I enjoyed the garbanzo bean salad. Service staff is overwhelmed, so don't be in a hurry.<//text>

<Text>Haven’t come to Tara’s in over five years. Loved the food then, and still love it now. This time, I ordered the chicken momos (dumplings), Sherpa stew, and a mixed bbq platter to share with my sister. Needless to say, it was too much for the both of us so we had leftovers. Definitely recommend this restaurant for the food and ambience :)</Text><user_id>113832967925680565827</user_id><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba374ca8b39b:0x339df28ba971a512< /Gmap_id>< username>

Absolutely love this place. Right down the street from me and always exceeds my expectations. I've had four different burgers, each one absolutely bomb. Large, juicey and the perfect amount of sauce (for someone who lathers their food in sauces). Two different type of the noodles, both super great and massive portions. I get an extra side of sauce for the noodles.
This is one of my family's staples now when no one wants to cook hahaha.
Love this place, food is always great and employees are very sweet.< /Text>

I love this place SO MUCH. Prior to eating here I had only had Himalayan food once but it was so extraordinary and I knew I wanted to eat more of it. Tara's is across the street from my dentist and is always a must stop after. I have only eaten here in Covid times, and I feel super comfortable doing so. I would love to know what it is like in non pandemic times. I have eaten on the patio which is nice but today it was too cold so I took my food to go. The chana masala and aloo gobi are fantastic but I live for the daal. After eating their daal, I attempted to make them at home and could never replicate the deliciousness of Tara's.

The staff has always been very kind, open, and informative. I have watched them interact with all types of people and there seems to be a really natural accord. As someone who isn't very familiar with the food they serve, they always answer all my questions and help me decide to get that day. I would recommend eating here to anyone.< /Text>

<Text>The menu has so many options that you want to get more than you should... but hey that's what sharing is for?

My favorite here so far is the open faced Zaatar bread with cheese.  This leaves you with a warm, delicious flatbread with the delicious spices such as sumac, oregano, thyme, savory, and sesame seeds.  The cheese adds some saltiness to it, but just enough.<//Text>< user>

They also have different menus here. The dish that we ordered was chicken marsala, chili chicken and piccata. It was all served fresh and tasty. I really like how it cooked. I would be coming back here again.<//Review>< time>

The food and service here were both exceptional.  The Yak Chili was excellent.  I ordered it 10/10 spicy, and it was just right for me, but I enjoy my food pretty spicy.  Their scale seems to be overstated a bit (more mild than you would expect).  The hot, fresh garlic naan was also excellent.< /text>

My dad brought my boyfriend and I here for breakfast and I honestly don't think it's meant for a breakfast place. I got the pressed garlic chicken panini, my boyfriend got the breakfast scramble, and my dad got the ajarski. My sandwich was great,  even at 10:30am lol. The skillet was a bit heavy for breakfast but my boyfriend liked it, and the arjaski was yum but the egg was too watery for my taste. The owner is super friendly but a little bit money hungry and cheap. We told him to leave our tab open because we were going to keep ordering stuff and his eye was wide open to make sure he didn't miss a single item, and when we asked for more ketchup packets he got a little weird and gave maybe 3 more (kind of ridiculous for 3 dishes and 3 people). Otherwise, it was great and I'd come back.<//text>

<Text>Arguably the best Arab food in SoCal. I used to live in the Middle East and super picky. I've tried Sunnin, the Persian restaurants, Israeli ones, Ans Armenian Arab owned ones (which this is one) and no one does it like Byblos. First off they have their own brick oven that pushes out some of the best lavash I've ever had (it's so hard and always has the potential to taste like cardboard - not here).  All the Mezzes are some of the best in LA especially the hummus and the baba. And their shawarma is some do the best I've ever had - no joke. And don't forget about the cheese and za'ater laces baked goodies. OMG, am salivating as we speak.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Delicious. Try the jack fruit dish. It's great. Also, the garlic na'an is tasty. Service could be better. Our waiter, after dropping off our order disappeared, never to show up again.I had to go inside to look for him. Still, worth a trip it you're on the Westside</review>

We had ordered vegtarian momos, thukpa sherpa stew, Aloo bodi Tama, roti and gulab jamun. The stew had distinct taste, momos were bland, aloo bodi Tama was decent. gulab jamun was good. I might go there for the stew again but may not be for lunch/dinner.<//Text>

<text>We were craving for Nepalese food and found this amazing casual Nepalese and Tibetian restaurant in Santa Monica.

5 star for the service and we really enjoyed the hospitality from Biren. Thanks for accommodating our service pet so we could dine in while we were traveling.

Although MoMos and the goat curry was decent, they had delicious Thukpa we had after a long time.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2ba374ca8b39b:0x339df28ba971a512<//gmap_id><time>1576702910507< /time>< userid>

We drove 45 minutes just for this authentic Himalayan Cuisine. With so many flavors and spices and options to choose from it was an experience I will be repeating often. So happy to find a place I can eat with my vegan friends.  This is a must try! The soups are hardy and super flavorful.  It was worth the drive, traffic and parking. Will be back.< /Review>

Great little Nepali restaurant! Three people shared the platter for two! Must come! If you're looking for an intimate spot in the mission away from a big crowd then this is it. The chef even came out to all the tables to see if we were enjoying our meals.</text>

Yummmm where do I start?
They have an extensive wine list for those who love wine. Their main course consists of pastas, salads, pizzas and paninis. They also have a special menu which they rotate and change form time to time. Place is pretty cozy so come early or remember to make a reservation.<//Review>

<review>This funky food restaurant is your one-stop spot for authentic Puerto Rican and Caribbean food dishes, including mofongo, fried pork, shrimp, octopus, lobster, fried fish, and many more. You can dine to the vibrant sounds of live music. The ambiance is amazing, but the food itself is even better. Their service is fast, plating are big, and their chicken is out of this world!

It took them a lot of time to take our order and an even longer time to get it. I believe that was because I went on a Friday night<//Text>< pics>

Best samosas ever...and very reasonably priced. I love the food here. There are plenty of vegetarian options, but I'm pretty sure this place is known for it's yak stew, which I've not tried. Parking isn't easy; limited street parking.< /Review>

The *yak chili* here is so delicious, it’s an experience. I was on a cloud for several minutes, completely in heaven and did not even realize that we had all stopped talking in a daze. SO good, worth coming back for. The saag paneer was delicious and creamy too.</Text>

One of the best restaurants I've ever been to! The spices are beyond words. The flavors transport us to another world. Whether we order the lentil soup, chana masala, aloo gobi, jackfruit curry, coconut korma, or bhindi masala, we are never disappointed. The staff is kind and the owner is an incredible woman. They're also extremely accommodating for vegans! I wish I could give them ten stars ☆<//Review>

Food was mindblowingly good, however we arrived at 6pm on a Friday night (it was empty but quickly filled up) and still waited more than 35/40 minutes for our food. Clean and lovely dining room and bathrooms, great decor. The servers could definitely be friendlier and more attentive.<//text>

<Review>I was there today with my friends and we did order for dumpling, kachumber, aloo achar and chow chow. On aloo achar the first they gave it to me was nothing just the potato marinated and in photo I’ve got is second they give it to us after telling it was tasteless. In momo I expect fresh tomato achar but got staled one. I hope it was just for me today not for others.</Review>< rating>

<Text>This place is sometimes mistaken as Indian restaurant, but it is an Nepali/tibetian restaurant.
Food is quite ok, you won’t get much options in vegetarian cousin. Beer and wine is also served here!</Text>< pictures>

This place is awesome!

I am starting to discover Himalayan food so I'm no authority, but I am a very diverse eater and try lots of cuisines.  This cuisine has obvious influences and some dishes from India and South East Asia but with its own unique style.

My favorite is the Thukpa Sherpa stew which I think is specifically Himalayan food and is red and spicy.  The large bowl is brimming with flavor, vegetables, noodles, and a meat of your choice if you want meat.  I get the yak!

Spiciness scale is 1-10.  I can eat Thai hot and the 7 is perfect for me.  I could possibly go 10 but I prefer 7 and I think most Americans should stay below 5.  The combination of temperature hot and spicy hot will make you leak a bit of water.

But damn this place is amazing!!!  I've had other dishes here too that are excellent so go for anything.

I come here at least twice a month.<//review>

It's like a slightly tougher stewed beef texture, and the spices are absolutely delicious. The cherry on top is that not only are all their spices sourced directly and sustainable from the Himalayan mountains, they donate a portion of their revenue to education of young girls in that area. Everything is unique and super tasty.< /review>< user_id>

Food has been amazing every time we go. Great spot if you like spicy and full flavored foods.  Try the salted yogurt drink for a real unique drink (not for everyone). The service is always kind but can be a little slow at times. This is one of my favorites on the west side.<//review>

Tara's continues to be a solid choice for some authentic Himalayan cuisine (aside from the chicken tikka masala and some of the other entrees). The goat curry with bone (Khasi Ko Masu) was delicious. The thick curry with very little oil and likely no dairy reminded me of a home cooked meal. If you're getting it medium spicy, you'll feel the heat, so get the plain sweet lassi on the side, which I found to be delicious and unlike most other lassi you'll see elsewhere. You'll definitely want the naan to go with the Khasi Ko Masu. The service can be a little slow for a Friday night, but you'll leave a happy camper. Parking is impossible in the area, but after your delicious meal, you'll forget the rage you walked in with.</Text>

Good food; good service.

If you've never tried Tara's, it's basically Indian fare but the spices used are a little different. There are also things like Yak meat on the menu, which is quite good.

They have an extensive vegetarian menu as well. We have been going to Tara's for years and have always been met with great service.</Review>

<review>This food is SO delicious! Ask for the flavor you prefer (Mild - Medium - Spicy). Be patient with parking because it is SO worth it!!!! A must if you are looking for Himalayan food. I compare this to Indian food but this is definitely the better of the two. Nice spot for friends or a date :)< /review>< username>

I’ve lived in Culver City my whole life and I’m so mad that I have not come here before. That all changed today. I ordered the chicken tandoori lunch special and my god, my tastebuds have never been more satisfied. I also had the Nepali-style hot milk tea. So tasty!!! The portions are great for the price, and the flavors were fantastic. Don’t question your next meal any longer, this place will leave you happy and satisfied. I’m definitely coming back!< /review>

This restaurant is best suited to larger groups, as you'll want to try as many dishes as possible, so family style is the way to go.< /text>< pictures>

Our favorite place for a quiet romantic dinner. Food is constantly good, service reminded me when I helped out my family restaurant. It is a quite cute family running that place. Very sad we moved away, because we loved coming here.</Review>

The place isn't really impressive. The Tandoori Chicken didn't taste like Tandoori Chicken. Though one may question the wisdom of ordering Tandoori chicken in a Nepali place. But even the Chow Chow tasted more like noodles in some Indian gravy. Vegetarian momos were a huge disappointment, with them being completely bland. My friends ordered an eggplant curry, and it was more on the side of Baingan Bharta. 3 stars because the staff was friendly, and the service was good.<//text>

I got there after 30 minutes, as soon as I reached; the lady brought the check and got the payment. After I signed the receipt she said it will take 2 minutes, I was riding in the cab but didn't mind waiting for two minutes. After 5 minutes when I still didn't see any movement I asked about my order and they said it will take another 5 minutes. I told them I am riding in a cab and paying for this wait time but they didn’t care about it. After another 10 minutes, they handed me an undercooked chicken and ice cold potatoes right out from the refrigerator. I am staying in a hotel with no microwave in room, I cannot re-cook chicken or warm frozen potatoes. Above all, they didn’t bother to say anything about it. I could have been their regular visitor and would have spread the word, but not anymore.

Hated it!!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Best Himalayan/Nepalese restaurant EVER! The head Chef and owner is amazing, kind and so warm and friendly. When he found out from one of the waitresses that we had asked if there was any hotter hot sauce she had said no he came over and cooked up an extra dish as spicy as you could order-on the house! He also left the bottle of wine for us to enjoy.So hospitable, the food was delicious.A gem of an establishment with a mom and pop feel to it .My wife and I will be back- we are hi king of making this a weekly or biweekly spot.< /review>

She was looking for momos. Initially I was not interested in this place but when I step in to the restaurant. I realized this place is authentic and their ambience is like Tibetan / Nepali.
We have ordered for Momos and Indian set for our lunch. It took 15 min to receive to our table. Momos were Outstanding with the chutney they provided.
Chicken gravy is damn good with the Nan.
They are checking with us offend how about the food. Service is outstanding.
If you come to LA at least once you should try this.
Will definitely recommend this place.</Review>< Pics>

Loved the food and the people.< /text>

The food is amazing and the service here makes you feel like you are really back in Nepal. Anyone who has been there knows how amazing that is. I have been coming here for years and bring relatives from abroad to this place as a treat. They always want to come back here upon their next visits. The owner Tara is like the most loving mother...words cant describe how much I love the food, the service, and the love that is put into the place. Btw I am vegan and her vegan dishes are bomb!< /Review>

<text>Wow this place is good! I normally don't like Indian food, but this place is more of an Indian fusion place haha. I never thought I could get Yak in West LA, especially in curry form. Yak curry runs out, so order early!

This time I got the Sherpa Stew. Amazing. Great hangover soup/ winter-is-coming soup/ i-got-a-flu soup if ya know what I mean. It is spicy!! But this is coming from a girl who needs milk when eating buffalo wings haha... But it is so good. I got the vegetable option and there's so many fresh veggies in there. It comes with spaghetti noodles inside.. Not that much.. So just head over to Ralph's to buy more :) For $6.99, you will be full and might even have some left over for lunch the next day ;)< /text><Time>1417559537155< /Time>< userid>

The food here is delicious. And, I know it sounds weird, but I have never had a better mojito. I have had a mojito at almost every restaurant that I have been to that has them. This one was the best by far. I do not know what they did to make it so good, but if you are old enough and you drink, get a mojito here. The food is delicious too. I love the platters.<//Text>

<review>The garlic tofu and sherpa stew didn't look like anything special so I was surprised how flavorful they were! Idk what Himalayan herbs/spices consist of exactly, but I love them. Parking lot in the back is very limited; recommend parking along the street instead.<//review>< Pictures>

Been here probably 30 times in the 5 years I've been in LA. Never less than stellar food and while the service could be faster sometimes it couldn't be more helpful.</Review>

There are not many Nepalese restaurants in LA. Despite the lack of competition, Tara's food is really good. The momos are just as good as anything in Kathmandu and the yak chili is fantastic!<//Text>

While in LA I was looking for a place to try Nepali food since I'm a Nepali myself. Though the environment was lively and decor homely, the food was trash. We got yak chilli which didn't taste like yak in first place and was tasteless. Their dumplings were tasteless so was the goat curry. Never going back!!</review>

they have some items for vegans but they are known for their lamb dishes. It doesn't look much on the outside but that is beside the point. They also have potato naan which i never seen in other places, may want to try that too.</Review>

Visited this place with my son for afternoon meal and had vegetable momos. The taste of momos were bit flat as per Nepali standard, it may be because their target customers are primarily locals not Nepalese. The ambience was great and the walls were decorated with traditional Nepali wooden windows and masks.< /review>

Looooooove Tara's. My place of employment, friends, and family frequent this place. We have great customer service when calling in, picking up, getting delivery, and dining in. Their Tikka Masala, cheese naan, and lamb saag are some of my favorites. If you are a spice fanatic ask for "Level 10", it's a great slow burn!<//Review>

<Review>Tara's always does a fabulous job.  The food is great. But if you have the time and a little extra for a good tip - STAY. It's like stepping into a new realm. The paintings are beautiful and take you away. The people are so nice and some will chat you up if you'd like. I always feel like time slows down and my worries fall by the wayside. Plus I believe 10% of their profits go towards educating Nepali children (& women?). My favorite meal is Hot Himalayan Tea {I will come by just for tea}, lamb korma, saag paneer, rice, and garlic naan. I enjoy the chicken momos, too. And samosas with chutney. And the yak chilli if you want to try something different. Chicken Tikka, sizzle skillets, eggplant appetizer is different & served chilled but still tasty. Mustard greens. I don't know if you can go wrong here. But be careful about spice. Sometimes mild can border on medium so if spice isn't what you're after, make sure they know to dial down the heat.< /Review>< rate>

<review>The food was authentic and delicious; the momos' skins stayed soft for hours after they were brought home. If you eat momos regularly, you'll know what I mean! It's a great, cozy place with a wonderful owner who is attentive without being intrusive. If only it wasn't so far from home!</review>< pics>

<text>I was born in India. This is the only Indian restaurant I go to in LA. Most people try their yak, but I would recommend any of their meat curry dishes, like makhani or korma. Also their cheese naan. Other places do cheese naan, but no one does it quite like this.<//text>< Pictures>

<resp>None<//resp><rate>4< /rate><Text>Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. First time and it's literally down the street from me!

FOOD:
We brought our own bottle of wine, I think corkage is $5?
- garlic naan - good, but not as garlicky as I thought it would be
- yak chili (medium) - really good but it tasted like sweet and sour pork haha
- lamb makhani (medium) - kinda curry-like since we ate it with rice, flavorful and good heat
- samosas - SO GOOD!

SERVICE:
SO FRIENDLY I love them!! We were greeted and checked on by several people. Food came out quickly and they even chatted with us a little bit :)

VENUE/PARKING:
Venue is pretty large and has a homey vibe. Can accommodate large parties as well. There's a small parking lot in the back.

Really interesting food!< /Text><gmapID>0x80c2ba374ca8b39b:0x339df28ba971a512</gmapID><date>1413310577732</date><user>111755180656428645742< /user>< Name>

<text>Tara needs to hire new management or start cracking the whip on her careless employees. On October 27th, the restaurant received a score of 74 (C rating) with the County of Los Angeles Public Health Department. Violations included "Hands clean and properly washed; gloves used properly", "Food contact surfaces: clean and sanitized", "Personal cleanliness and hair restraints" and "Proper hot and cold holding temperatures" as well as a host of maintenance issues like "Floors, walls and ceilings: properly built, maintained in good repair and clean", "Adequate ventilation and lighting; designated areas, use" and "Plumbing: Plumbing in good repair, proper backflow devices". BEWARE: THIS PLACE IS A MESS AND VERY UNSANITARY!</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_i8PKkLNoy25G9_8qxIwOs6uo7JF4Es9LFv0s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2ba374ca8b39b:0x339df28ba971a512<//gmapID></record>

You know you are in for a treat when the waiter is so cognizant of your needs that he goes beyond to cater for you. We had a kid that doesnot eat spicy at all, and they catered to that! We are amazed the owner would come by and ask if we were doing okay every now and then, we sat outside in the patio and loved the atmosphere! the decor inside with all the paintings is amazing!

A little suggestion though: maybe the rice portions on the thalis should be increased, it seems too low. However, they did bring us extra rice when we asked for it at no cost, not sure if everyone knows that!

Overall, a great dining experience! Ya'll should go!< /Review>

The food was good. It had a nice twist spice-wise on Indian food, such as their Saag Paneer and Chicken Tikka Masala. The front dining area is outside and, while on a busy street, was fairly quiet and secluded since it is mostly enclosed by plants. Service was good. Will definitely return to this place.<//Review>

Couple that with the fact that its one of the only , if not the only himalayan restaurants in all of LA. You can see why people love it. Don't really need to talk about the food much as its been reviewed by Jonathan gold and other famous food critics so you can check out their professional reviews for a good idea of the food. Pretty much if you like indian food or any thai/chinese you'll more then kiley love this place. Food tip get the lamb korma and the yak chili (its not that type of texas chili).<//review></record></dataset><record>

Really liked the sauce used with the papadum crackers served before the meal, better than the sauces you get at Indian restaurants for the same.

The steamed chicken momo dumplings were delicious, with really good wrapping.

The pokhareli chicken was fantastic, I just loved the flavor of the sauce.

The chicken khorma was tasty, like a chicken curry.

The saag paneer was much like what you'd find at an Indian restaurant, as were the naan.< /Text>
