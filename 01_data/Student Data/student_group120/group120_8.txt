<review>Very inexpensive and high quality.  I always use a coupon and pick up rather than pay delivery fees.  My favorite coupon is the $7.99 each item (3 topping pizza and chicken included).<//review><response>None<//response>< name>

We ordered a small extra red sauce pepperoni pizza and an order of garlic twists. Not only was there nearly NO red sauce on the pizza. It was also not cut properly so we had to tear it. There was an odd taste to the dough. The twists were also very lack luster as well. Our experience was not great at all. Defiently suggest going to a different dominos. Very unhappy with our pizza. Will not be returning.</text>

I ordered through the app. It shows this as my closest location. I used points and paid the rest. My ordered was cancelled due to unavailable delivery ability when they are the store closest to my delivery address. The associate lied to me directly saying my points would come back once cancelled and then I could reorder at another location. Not only did my money not come back neither did the points. I just spent 30 minutes of my tine to be told there is nothing Domino's can do expect give me a $10 gift card for future use. I am appalled by the store associate and customer service. Not only am I ordering for myself but I am pregnant. The stress I have endured was unnecessary and unwanted.< /text>

As far as Domino's goes. This is the best one I've ever been to.
I really don't have much more to say.
It's Domino's. This isn't gourmet dining.

That being said, this Pizza exceeds the quality expected for the price point.
If you're trying to smash some zaa and don't have all the shekels for a kings level pizza, get on down to this Domino's.
That's why I give it a five. For what it is, it's a 5/5</text>

The order was half an hour late for a carry out and I was waiting in the store the whole half hour. I was offered the wrong order 3 times after my name was asked 8 times. The tracker said my order was ready the whole time and they never explained why it took so long</review>

Always a great stop for lunch! I can use a coupon online and then end up with lunch and dinner! The location is great and I have yet to go in and receive poor customer service. Everyone at this location seems to be pretty happy with how thing are going. It's good to see people happy at their jobs.</Review>

Apparently they changed the distance of delivery to only a couple of miles. I live 4.6 miles from the store and have had many deliveries which were a joke at best but that's there new policy. That's okay, I'll just keep cooking good real food for my children.<//Review>

<Review>The pizza was undercooked, like most of the crust was translucent dough goop. After the app said it was made, it just sat for 45 mins. Also ordered extra sauce and there just wasn’t any sauce. And apparently the app said it was made by the manager. It’s just gross, this isn’t food, and it wasn’t a cheap order, and it kinda ruined a special occasion leaving everyone hungry.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I ordered two pizza the other day. I asked for extra cheese and pepperoni on one of the pizza but it just look like a normal pizza to me. Also on the other pizza, I ordered a supreme and my pizza didn't have pepperoni. It just felt like who ever that made my pizza did a lazy job. I won't be coming back anytime soon.</text>

<text>I know Dominos get bagged on a lot.  I like their Brooklyn style, it’s very good. BUT the last three times we’ve ordered from this location it has taken over an hour to get our pizza.  The last two times I called and got excuses about how busy they are.  That’s really not my problem.  If it has happened twice to me, it is happening a lot.  Change your business model and get enough help.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Gmap_id>0x809b1fd0d6fc261d:0x5cc6012a7886a0c6</Gmap_id>< userid>

< Review>
I rarely eat pizza; but my husband is one of those every-other-day types. He loves this pizza. Ordering online is simple, especially since he always likes the same 2 kinds. Order tracking is almost fun to keep up with (I'm old; I don't get out much!) and accurate on delivery time. We usually have the same young man deliver - consistency is nice! - and he is polite in a way rarely seen any more these days. All around a great experience. And on the rare occasions I do order for myself, a wonderful "Hawaiian" style is easy to build AND delicious! Highly recommend the Sierra College Blvd store, on the edge between Roseville and Granite Bay.< /Review>

<Text>Just lazy service and terrible in person service. Called in my pizzas 45min later I pick it up and they only made one. I ask we’re is the other there isn’t one they say I am getting frustrated saying there is and they tell me it will be another 30 min wait. No we are sorry no excuses just order it if you want.

<Review>We LOVE ordering from Dominos. We do "pizza Friday's" and we always are happy with the food, speed of delivery and price! So happy they are around!! Also, the one time they forgot my extra ranch, the girl who delivered the pizza was so apologetic and insisted she go back to the store and bring us the ranch. I really thought that was great customer service and didn't expect it, but it shows how dedicated they are!</Review><user>115681057745964691337<//user><username>Joette Len</username><date>1500077561019</date></record></dataset><record>

It's been a long time since I've had Domino's and it completely surpassed my expectations! My delivery driver got to me in 18 min in Granite Bay! The Stuffed cheesy bread is killer, the pizza with the garlic crust is amazing, and everyone that works there are wonderful people! Ask for specials for great deals!!<//review>

<Review>The pizza took well over an hour to arrive. By the time it arrived, It was cold. The pizza cost too much. When I called to ask where the delivery was after an hour passed, the employee was nonchalant about the slow delivery and nonapologetic. Nothing was offered to compensate for the cold pizza which had to be reheated in the microwave.</Review>< resp>

Lunch would have been better if they made it the way you ordered it, light sauce and I also paid for extra ranch that I DID Not receive. I guess since the struggle is real they keep the ranch and charge the customer for it, it can all add up. Thanks Domino's!!</Text>

When we order pizza, we choose Dominos. The website is super user friendly. The store is awesome and so are the employees. It’s close to our home so it’s convenient. The pizza is always hot & delicious wether it’s take out or delivery. We love ❤️ Dominos!< /review>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service from the counter person, although the pizza is delicious it does not make you want to stay and eat it.

If you're looking for a spot with quality custom work, this is the spot to go. They won't disappoint. VJ is the man to see. You won't regret it.
I will most definitely be coming back. Thank you!</Text>

Great experience and service. I wanted to gift a custom printed pair of tshirt for my best buddy's birthday and this place is where to be. They printed my custom design within 30 minutes with full satisfaction. I can't think of any better place than this< /review>

Very fast and polite I do think they should lower down their price a bit to pricey just for something to be printed on in less then 3 to 4 minutes my shirt cost 35</Text>

<text>I got a t-shirt printed today at the Stixntees kiosk at brea mall today. A friend recommended me this over the shop i used to go to and man the prices are so less i could have saved a lot if i had come here earlier. The print was excellent and the best part is that it's all done so quick in minutes!

<Review>This is my 3rd year of  making a custom t shirt for my wifey.
I still remember that day when i came across this kiosk beside footlocker while going to the food court .That  tall guy, i dont  remember his name i told him about the surprise i want to give   Written as " Will You Marry me" he made it so perfect , wearing that t shirt i proposed her .  Good quality of printing , reasonable price . Always reminds me the proposal day.Still i have those two T shirt  from past two years , which looks like as if   i bought today. Thanks for the quality you guys maintai</Review>< rate>

<text>This place saved me so much money. I’m glad I took a chance and decided to stop by...Jesus Santillan helped me out big time . He was very professional and went into detail about my coverages. I explained to him about my budget he said not to worry that I was going to leave his office happy and I sure did . The price ! The coverage ! And the customer service I received was impecable . I’ve now referred 3 of my family members to him because he’s that good . Customer service like that goes a long way. Thank you Jesus !<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1602121602152, 'text': 'Hello Jazmin, we thank you for sharing your experience with us.

I went into freeway insurance because I seen the commercials speaking how cheap it was, i had insurance with anchor thru another place but it would never go down. This renewal they wanted to charge over 600 monthly. I finally decided to go into freeway insurance and was greeted by America Melendez, she was very helpful and she was able to save me over 200 dollars monthly. I would recommend this place to everyone looking to save money. Thank you America for your great service and being able to help me.<//text>

Read the fine print before signing anything for the $400-$450 they ask for at sign up.

They say it's for your documents, first, and last month of insurance but it is a bogus start up fee that is non-refundable.</text>

I don't recommend this insurance company. Terrible. $500 for starting service fee plus one month insurance fee. They are just abusing customers<//review>

I found a hair in my food recently. Management just quietly took the food away. There was no apology or action taken to fix the situation. My appetite was lost to say the least. Probably won't return sadly</review><user_name>Carlos Flores</user_name>< Pics>

<Text>Called to order dinner.. Had the lady repeat it twice to make sure it was correct being I was driving over 30 minutes from Fresno yet somehow she still managed to get it WRONG. The food wasnt ready when we got there even though we were told 15-20 minutes.. Drove back home to find out that they gave me some nasty, burnt, falling apart corn tortillas when I ordered flour. So, I didnt get the FAJITAS I ordered but a little bit of beef with a whole bunch of uncooked bell peppers and flavorless rice. I've been eating here for 4 years and this is absolutely unacceptable when I paid $40 for our dinner. Times are hard and taking peoples money and giving them food that isn't edible is shameful. I won't be back and neither will my friends and family.<//Text><Response>None< /Response>< userid>

<Review>I have eaten here 4 times. I like to support local businesses. Each time there was something wrong with my order. I ordered a shrimp tostada not to long ago. Got home to find it was mostly lettuce.  The few shrimp that was on it was good but not worth the price. Yesterday I gave them 1 more shot. Because the menu selection was limited breakfast I ordered a breakfast burrito with no meat. What I got was a bean and potato burrito. No eggs rice or cheese. When I brought it up to the waitress she nicely apologized and asked if I'd like a side of eggs. I declined as it was already time to leave. What bothers me is that I was still charged the full price. I do not like taking pleasure in writing negative review.<//Review>< Response>

{'time': 1595192891659, 'text': "Hi Devan,\nI'm sorry you felt that the staff was disrespectful but they were a bit thrown off when you arrived at 11:10-11:15 for your food pick up when our ticket said 11:36.  You placed your order at 11:06 am through our website which we use a third party and it is automated for a 30 minute window to pick up the food. I will need to investigate if their is a glitch in the system as we did not receive the message they sent you.\nAs a small business we are trying to facilitate every avenue to generate sales during this pandemic and sometimes things are out of our control and for one to give us a 2 star due to a misunderstanding is a bit unfair when all one needs to do is communicate, i hope you are able to find another restaurant that meets all your expectations"}<//response>

Service was so bad and the staff is very disrespectful. They have no respect for anybody except “Daily customers” if you show up 5 min early they will tell you too leave and come when the food is done on their time and it was not worth waiting for.<//review>

We love the food here. It's always very flavorful. This experience was especially good because we were on a time crunch. I asked our server if there was any way we could put a rush on our food because we found out we had to be somewhere 30 minutes earlier than when we thought at the time that I made the reservation. She was so nice about it, and she worked her tail off and we were able to make it to our destination on time. So kudos to her. I wish I could remember her name.< /Review>

Great restaurant! delicious Mexican food and very good service. The dining room is very small so you might have to wait or get there earlier than lunch/dinner rush. They also have an outdoor seating area. good lunch specials too, like 10 to choose from daily.</Text>

A converted gas station, turned into a Mexican restaurant. A considerable amount of money has been spent on the conversion and it's actually pretty darn nice. The food was very, very good with a nice friendly staff. We ate outdoors and there were lots of potted plants and greenery all about. I truly enjoyed the place and would definitely go back again, if I ever make it back to town!<//Review>< pics>

<review>Too many restaurants are stuffing their guacamole with tons of tomatoes and onions to save on the cost of avocados. Being that I can't eat tomatoes, I would pay more to eat real guacamole.  I let the waitress know that I couldn't eat too much cheese and that I didn't want anything on top of my Chimicanga plus no mole. They put the mole inside and topped it with CHEESE! THERE WAS CHEESE UNDER IT TOO!< /review></record>

< Review>
Rosa Linda's is a very good local restaurant. They have another location in Fresno, but I've not eaten there yet. The dining room is modest in size. The food quality is exceptional. Their take on the traditional Mexican food is very good with sauces that have their own touch of flavor that sets them apart from other Mexican restaurants in the area. My wife loves the soups. I like their "Selma Tacos" (and every other menu item!) The one drawback to the atmosphere in the restaurant is that when they are busy it is quite noisy with conversations reverberating across the room and it can be difficult to hear conversation at your own table.</Review>

<Review>Rosalinda's was my favorite restaurant until now. We visited a couple weeks ago and I ordered my favorite, Fajita Caesar Salad  which was prepared with Ranch. We gave them another chance this Sunday. Again I ordered my favorite, and again it was disappointing.  My husband ordered a crispy taco and it was soggy as soon as it was served. The restaurant was full of flies and when we brought it to the servers attention,  she laughed.  I was so disappointed and disgusted. After many faithful years of eating at Rosalinda's, Sunday was our final day.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The original Rosa Linda’s
I’ve been going to this place since the early 80s when it was formerly called Senor Neros.  Food was great then & still the great today.  I always get the Selma Special, 2 steak 🌮 🌮 tacos with rice & beans.  Delicious 😋<//review>

My first time there and my last. Food was very greasy and had no flavor. The restaurant was hot.  We paid $5.95 for a taco and $5.50 for a beer.. That is a little to much.  Over all very disappointing 😢</Review>

I had the Steak Ranchero plate without rice. The beans were good. The steak ranchero had a bitter/sour flavor to it. When we were asked how everything was I told the waitress about the flavor. I asked if they cooked cilantro into it or if the tomato was canned. She said no. I showed her the burnt pieces of cilantro. I told her that if I had known there was cooked cilantro in it I wouldn’t have ordered it. She told me it says that it is an ingredient in the menu. I wasn’t bothered by the food not being good. The servers attitude and lack of knowing what’s written in the Menu where she works does. The customer isn’t always right I know that but don’t defend bad food if you didn’t cook it. Don’t say something is written or printed in the menu if it’s not. If she reads it she’ll realize that she was wrong. I could have put her on the spot while we were paying and showed her what’s on the menu but she’s a big girl maybe she’ll read it someday.</Text>

Only issues of concern is the server"s drink openly in front of guests without washing their hands . Our server actually sneeze into her hands and trimmed her fingernails  In front of us without bothering to wash her hands while still scooping chips and pouring drinks . I would recommend their staff revisit a food safety course . It's a shame  because that place is one of the better Mexican places to eat at . Hopefully management puts a stop to it . Besides the food safety concerns which is a easy fix. The food is always good, the service is good  and the tacos are GREAT! I will continue visiting this place.<//review>< Pics>

Absolutely recommend this place! We stopped here not sure the food. Once we order and got our food we were amazed by the quality and taste of the food!  We order menudo and this was the best I have tried n years! Too bae W don't live close by. We were travel back home from Bakersfield to Sacramento and found this place after googling for Mexican food. The best!!<//review>

Our Rosa Linda's is the Selma location. Wonderful people who pride themselves on the food and service they provide. ABSOLUTELY THE BEST MENUDO!! Everything is delicious but if you haven't tried their green salsa, you are missing out!<//review>

Not authenthic at all. Mostly for non-hispanic people, those who dont cook or know what good Mexican food tastes like.It is Taco Bell quality, except it is way overpriced. Each taco is $4.95,  one flauta, tamale, or flauta. That's without rice and beans. If you want good Mexican food, go to Fresno: Tacis Tuana, Don Pepes, Cucas, etc.<//Review>< pics>

<review>My experience was not good. There food is not good enough for what they charge for it. You want good Mexican food. Go to Ortega's or Juantio's. Sorry but when I looked at my burrito for 10.00 dollars I was like what is this. It was just thrown there.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><name>Stephanie Lara< /name>< user_id>

I call in my order could order enchilada or quesadillas because they were to busy, finally the cook said he would make the quesadillas but not the enchiladas. When I got there 15 min later to pick up my order the Restaurant was almost  very clean & empty they only had 3 couples in the restaurant. When I placed  my order  I estimated  33 and change plus about 3 in tax  when i went to pay it was 42 and change   Their prices are way off in this web page compared to their menu prices. plus their menudo was water down or something was missing had no flavor. Never going in there again.<//Text>

Please go to Taco Bell instead. They are super stingy with the meat. In a beef burrito it was mostly beans.</Review>

<text>Food is good but portions are very small. The prices r up there and personally i think its not worth it.The owner is nice but her crew and portions definitely in need of help.So if ur not hungry and want to spend money have at it.and on some of the reviews people say the owner is rude i thnk they were talking about her sister cuz the owner is very nice,her sister on the other hand is very rude.May b thats why her own sister told her to kick rocks.lol.</text>< Pictures>

I can't believe how rude the lady that owns it is! She is very mean to even her cooks and workers.  The food was mediocre</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) We come today to try the Chile Verde Burrito. Very rich! The Sopa de Albóndigas was also good with handmade corn tortillas. Our waitress was very friendly. We will go back to Selma again.

This was my third time visiting this restaurant and definitely the best,their food is fantastic and they will cook it to order all you have to do is ask, the customer service was great everything looked to be clean and sanitary if you like Indian food you should definitely go and check this place out, it is very small and quaint and definitely worth the visit👍. I worry about taking food home sometimes because it doesn’t seem to taste the same as if you were to eat it inside but it was fantastic.</Text>

Don’t recommend this place. Was starving, stopped for lunch to go. Got home when I tried the first taste of Goat Curry it was insanely lime and it made it worst when I found hair(dark and white colored) half way I had it.I was mad but had no choice since I was home.
I don’t know why this place received that many 5 stars. It was really a bad experience.<//review>

<text>I visited and ate at this nice wonderful restaurant on April 6th and 8th and Mr. Bae Bae was very polite and greetable to me and helped me understand the different entrees and sides he served that I couldn't all pronounced very well! Food was hot & fresh and nutritious/healthy! I have had Indian food in the past some years back, though after eating here, wow I felt like I was in heaven! The atmosphere or shall I say location of this place was safe and pleasant! The inside and outside of the restaurant was clean and of course the spices, smell of the food and freshness is what brought me but the second time, before heading back home! Mr. Bae Bae, I don't know if you'll ever remember me but I did tell you before that I will be visiting your restaurant again, whenever I do visit Riverside once again! Thank you for your wonderful service and hospitality!< /text><time>1619014977705</time><Gmap_id>0x80dcb1ba34c47eff:0xa4f4e945e611f586< /Gmap_id>< user>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>Decent and inexpensive. The owner (I'm assuming) is very nice and helpful. The place is clean and small.

The food is a bit bland. We should've spiced it up some, but decent Indian food. Will be back, I'm sure.</Review>< Pictures>

Love this place! But I can't review the service or location because I've never actually been there - This is my go to favorite Namaste Indian Kitchen! Always grab the lamb masala, and garlic naan.. Make sure to order rice or make a pot of you're at home as their Namaste Indian Kitchen doesn't include it</Review>

I come here often for lunch Masters Indian Kitchen . The selection of food is good. I love samosas and usually they're awesome but today it seems like they might have used a different recipe. I hope it's a one off because today's samosas weren't as good as usual. That said they still get 4 stars. CA has some terrible Indian food; thank god for India's Restaurant. The service is great. Ask for Asia. He's the best.< /text>

The staff is always kind and friendly. Anything you order will be edible and the taste is always palatable.  My wife loves this Indian place more than any of the others we have tried. All their breads are fresh and made to order.  If there is anything negative to say , I would say the portions are too small because we always fight over the remnants at the end.<//review>

Visited Namaste Indian Kitchen today for dinner and I was very impressed. Everyone was very welcoming and I felt this sense of being in a home more so than a restaurant, and it felt authentic. I ordered the lamb tikka, with garlic naan, and a vegetable samosa. The complexity of spices from star anise to peppercorn and corriander seeds that they used in the lamb tikka dish came so beautifully together to make such a flavorful dish. I will definitely be coming back! Thank you guys for the amazing food!< /text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>I am going to keep it real I love this place but I'm going to be honest. You have to acquire a taste for Indian food because everyone does in life. It is different especially their Spanish and some of their other items. But if you keep it simple you would be okay. They have a very nice staff always friendly and I love that homemade Indian bread. Remember they are a different culture don't expect their food to taste like American food. I go there all the time and the reason why I did this reveal. Because no one else really explain and I would hate for someone to go there and not like the food. So if you've never tasted Indian food before. Pick something on the menu that you have had before. I hope this helps</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb1ba34c47eff:0xa4f4e945e611f586</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is a great little Indian food restaurant, I think they cater mostly to take away. But there is sit down eating available. We each had the vegan dishes and they were quite generous and affordable. However I do think they could serve it on better Crockery, instead of the polyurethane plates. But if it keeps the prices down then I guess that's the way to go. Our server was extremely helpful and made the great suggestions for us. If you're in the area and you want to try something different this is certainly a place worth considering.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Stopped by in the evening to pick up some dinner. Had a rice and chicken meal with some nan. My order was to go. When I arrived home 10 minutes later my meal was still warm. Everything tasted good and plan to go back. Especially since the service was so good.< /Text>

Friendliest counter service you'll ever find! The food is waaaay too good for the price that they offer, I honestly think their lunch specials are a steal, and they're happy to modify the spiciness of their curry however you like. Plenty of vegan friendly options as well. I've had their chicken and lamb options too, both of which are excellent, not dried out like other quick service Indian places tend to be.<//Text>

<review>Food is simply amazing. The chicken tikka masala is the best, and the samosas are delicious. I've tried a bunch of different food here, and everything has been great.

The owner is incredibly nice, friendly, and welcoming. This is my favorite restaurant in Riverside.<//review></record>

Severely disappointed. I called ahead and I asked for Butter Chicken and the man on the phone repeated, "Chicken Tiki Masala". I told him I didn't want that, I wanted Butter Chicken. And he told me it WAS Chicken Tiki Masala. When I asked if he was sure, he laughed at me with someone on the other side of the phone. Thinking I maybe had it wrong, I said fine and when I got it, I didn't like the flavor, the texture was dry, but the garlic naan was good. I'm never coming back to an establishment that thinks they can just trick me into eating something I know I don't like. Gross.< /review>

<Review>This place is very good. The people who work here are very nice and the food is wonderful. The place is kind of hidden and you have to look for it if it's your first time. It's well worth your visit. We eat out quite a bit and try to make it here as much as possible.< /Review>< user_name>

The first time I visited, I didn't leave a review because I thought it was an isolated incident. This review is because I waited over 20 mins for my order because they seemed to forget to tell the order to the cook.  The first time, it was a full dining room, so I let it go. This time, no one but me was waiting. Could be better, the redecorating is nice but the service is not.</Review><user>117963333452477022065<//user>< Response>

<text>Such lovely people work here. Delicious freshly made naan bread. Nice array of vegan and vegetarian options. Beautiful handmade mandalas from Nepal displayed on bright orange walls - nice cantina environment. Great service, great prices. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner - big portions. Ask for hot sauce if you prefer a spicy dish.< /text>< UserId.>

Ok, so if you want the taste of India you need to try Namaste Indian Kitchen. Yummy!! We order from here often from Door Dash. Everything is good but, we really enjoy the saag paneer and any of the chicken dishes. Also, if you can't take hot, please only order mild. Even mildly or medium hot might be way too hot for you. We love spicy so we are good with hot but, even for us we never order more than medium. 😃</review>

We love Namaste Kitchen... delicious reasonably priced food. They have an incentive card for a free meal after so many purchases.  The buffet items are excellent or you can order for individual orders from the kitchen.  Big tasty samosas, amazing cauliflower, curry chicken, lentils,  and of course chana masala.  We always choose garlic naan because it's GREAT!  ENJOY!!< /review>

I stopped here on my way on thru riverside. There are lunch combo specials that are 5.99 6.99 7.99. The food was very good for a quick Indian diner on par or better than most bigger Indian restaurants.<//review>

I typically drive to redlands to get my indian food fix, but decided to try Namaste one evening and was pleasantly surprised.
There is a great mix of ready-made options available as well as a great offering of menu items that can be made on request.  There is also a nice variety of vegetarian dishes.  I particularly loved the daal, aloo gobi, and chana masala.
Garlic Naan was amazing, portion sizes are generous, and the prices will keep you going back.
I typically eat indian food once every month or two, and came back here twice in a week, it was that good!
They are also very kid friendly, so much that our three year old has asked to go back.  I highly recommend them!</review>

I'm addicted to this place! I come just about once every week! Great tasting food! I always get their 2-item combo; always chicken tikka masala, lentils, garbanzo beans, eggplant with potatoes or cauliflower with potatoes and garlic naan. Never disappoints!<//review>

Their aloo mattar was ok. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very good either. The samosas had decent insides, but they were so hard you could pound nails with them. The garlic nan was also unremarkable. The tamarind chutney, however, was the very worst I've ever had.</review>

<Text>Massive portions served here! Tried this place on a whim tonight after seeing the line at Flamebroiler and was very pleasantly surprised. Chicken Tikka Masala with rice, a vegetable assortment and garlic naan. Everything was served quickly and the restaurant appeared to be very clean. Dining in might be a bit crowded if you happen by at a busy time, but at around 8:30PM it was only myself and a couple. Food delicious and  freshly made, but a fair warning; the portions are huge...if you're with someone else you may want to split a chicken platter. If like me, you're eating alone then you will certainly have some delicious leftovers for later on.</Text>< pics>

<review>Firstly, the naan bread was lacking.. Ew, secondly, have more people work there or something.. I should be able to order whatever I like. Not only select item because you're to lazy to prepare it! Thirdly your plate game is weak. Styrofoam ??? Really fam? Over all the chicken masala was ok. They're are better Indian places though..

While I love to support local business, I was really dissapointed with the quality of food here, the wait time, the service, the temperature & the crowded room. Just some honest feedback. The people who own the place are lovely & they've done a really nice job fixing up the building.< /Review>

We love going out. Yesterday we  visited this delicious restaurant which friends recommended to us. We had a beautiful evening there with very good dishes and an efficient crew and  a professional  cuisine. We put this restaurant in our list  and we will definitely return very soon. We deeply recommend.</text>

I was really excited to have a place so close to our house and I truly hope they succeed, but we have given it three chances thus far. The service is great, the atmosphere is good. However, this last time was a deal breaker because we received a salad with wilted/browning greens with a dressing that tasted as if it had gone off.  This is simple and there really is not excuse for this...This place has so much potential, but each time there is just something a little off with the food (warm crust on pie & lukewarm interior from reheating, tough and greasy fried chicken, and over mayo-ed sandwich). These are simple fixes, but the food really, really, really needs some quality control. I don't think we will go back for at least another six months even though we less than a mile away. I hope  to see if things improve.< /Text>

Connie's has AMAZING quality food, friendly staff and is one of my new favorite places for breakfast. Their omelettes are huge and filling and cooked to perfection everytime. Come visit and see what the fuss is about at Connie's, it's worth it.</review>

<Text>Really good food. Great service. Bottomless mimosas. Chicken fried steak is really good. Corned Beef Hash is made from scratch. They cook the eggs as ordered so over easy is over easy not over medium like most other places. And it's the only place that serves breakfast between Coloma and Auburn... and only a couple in Coloma one of which is a dive and the other a fancier farm to fork type...So it just really nice to have a legit breakfast joint between Placerville and Auburn. It's a must go to place.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Great service from Chris and the other big juero from the other store to activate the Social Living Discount.  That was a bit of an inconvenience,  if its the same owner, why not just take Social Living/Groupon at any Powder House. I completed my order for my two kids to come to find out everything had to get voided and I had to drive to other location for coupon. Lost so much time, but the guys are so nice!!< /Review>

<Text>Dropped off our boards for wax and tune overnight. Staff was friendly but when we picked up the next morning, we didn’t notice until we got to the lifts that they weren’t waxed or tuned at all! Called the shop and no one answered. Very frustrating and spent $30 wasting time driving back and forth to the shop...<//Text>< pics>

Very nice people, but not the most competent. Make sure you double-check if your boots fit and if they fit on your skis. The girl that was helping me didn’t realize she brought me two different ski boots, came back with the correct pair, then assured me that they would fit the skis (they did not). She was very nice, but didn’t seem like she knew what she was doing exactly. Good thing I checked, otherwise I would’ve had to bring it to the rental shop at the resort and lose an hour or two of skiing.  Plus, they were going to charge us $18 for a helmet, even when their rates say $12. Check out the guys at The Ski Renter down the street, they were much more put together, charge $7 for helmets, and you feel safer with your equipment getting fitted by them.</Text>

<Text>Rented cross country skis from here. Staff was friendly but wasn’t very knowledgeable about the subject. One of the staff actually asked how they work when we returned them. One thing I don’t like was how they give you all the equipment downstairs but then make you walk all the way up to the top floor to ring you up, just so you can walk back down to your car. Make sure you order online ahead of time so you get the online discount which is a nice 25% off. Overall they are a pretty good rental place, I would just choose one if their other locations next time.</Text>< Pics>

Personable and knowledgeable staff.  The Powder house staff showed a genuine concern in gearing us up for fun and safety.  The process of renting and returning our equipment was super smooth.  The staff multi-tasked well with several patrons in the store.  We absolutely recommend this shop to everyone!  Thank you Powder House !<//review>

1) I reserved and paid online, but when I arrived, I had to re-type all the same information at the check in, then the guy who checked us out struggled for 30 minutes to figure out how to ring it up.
2) The guy who mounted my binding mounted the correct stance for goofy foot, but pointed the wrong direction. Thankfully, the bindings are hand removable and adjustable.<//review>< pics>

<Text>A good place to get cheaper prices on ski 🎿 equipment rentals. The equipment is in acceptable shape, the top two packages will usually be better (especially boots). The staff can be a hit and a miss, the good ones are pretty good. Upstairs you can usually find gloves and helmets on sale - for less than renting.<//Text>< pics>

My parents went there last winter. Although they already had a reservation, they spent more than an hour to pick up their equipment. The store was short of boots, poles and staff, and skies were in terrible shape.

You have better alternatives in South Lake Tahoe rather than Powder House/Rainbow Mtn.< /Review>

I rented ski equipment from this location for my family and was very disappointed.  The equipment is over 20 years old and should have been disposed of long ago.  My son's ski boots broke before he was able to ski.  Thankfully Heavenly Ski Resort provided him with a pair of new ski boots, skis and poles at no charge because they were concerned about his safety.  We were informed that the ski boots from Rainbow/Powder House were old and unsafe.  I didn't ski for 2 days due to pain from the old ski boots; the padding is completely worn out.  I do not recommend renting from this store.  It is not worth trying to save a few bucks to receive ski boots that are old and unsafe.  Zero Stars!<//text>

The equipment is in bad shape, their customer service is horrible, and they are not reasonable. We (family of 4) checked out the equipment for a certain amount of days, and confirmed with their staff when we could return the equipment.  They never informed us that we had to return the equipment by a specific time to avoid being charged an additional day. It was obvious the equipment wasn't used at all that day.  We returned everything early during the day. We spoke to the manager who didn't care about the confusion or lack of explanation.  They didn't even provide any documentation stating what would happen if the equipment wasn't returned by a specific time.  The manager stated that he was going to charge my credit card on file without my authorization. Don't rent any equipment from this company because they will rip you off!<//Review>< time>

We couldn't believe that they actually rent these snowboards or boots anymore. We left to rent from other stores nearby.

Huge thanks to Ted Moorhead for helping a computer challenged me make a rental reservation.
He single handedly saved and enhanced my upcoming snow trip. The best thing about powder mountain is the ability to pick up your rentals the day before your rental date, ensuring no lines on the day of your snow adventures!! Just pick it up the day before for No additional charge!!
I am very grateful for powder mountain and ted Moorhead today. Thank you very much.
If you ever have any problems, just email them. I promise they’re here to serve you on your snow days!!

For the same price, they offer older and lower-end ski packages compare to many other stores in south lake Tahoe. Their "basic" package is much worse than the real basic package I got from other stores; and the stuff there told me "I wouldn't feel the difference", which ruined my whole day in Sierra.</Review>

<Review>It used to be the locals shop..........NOT ANYMORE! there is no locals discount and the service SUCKS! I brought two pair of shorty skiis in for edges and wax before 10 AM on a Tuesday, 4 guys standing around in the tuning shop then and still there after 5 but they still haven't done their 5 minute $50 tune for me. They wanted me to wait 5 minutes while they did it adding insult to injury because it confirmed that a $50 tune up only took 5 minutes.........when they get around to actually doing it!    Don't waste your time and money with these turkeys.  Lawrence Foster< /Review>< pics>

<review>I actually rarely write reviews, but I was super disappointed in the manager of this store and his customer service. I could've gotten over getting rushed through the rental process at the beginning, but when we brought 1 of the 4 snowshoes we rented back because they didn't fit, the manager refused to refund us or do anything for us really. We literally didn't use them and were back in just a few hours. Not renting anything here and telling all of my friends Not to as well.<//review>< Pics>

Paul is a great mechanic, he is kind professional and always comes through when you need him. I use my car for business so I need my repairs done fast. Paul has always been such a help when my car breaks down. Paul tells you how it is, charges a fair price and is fast!</text>

<text>pretty quick and convenient spot to get your car maintenance done. Paul is great to work with and pretty good about explaining what is up and what needs to be done and what is recommended. wait times are usually not too bad, but they do get a bit busy on Saturday</text>< pictures>

<text>I love this place!! I only trust Paul with my car! I literally travel 23 miles just to go and have my car repaired here.
They are honest and they never are out to make a buck! their only goal is to make their customers happy and I am! It is almost impossible to find a mechanic that you trust and I trust them!!!</text>< pictures>

One of the last few honest mechanic shops out there. I live in Fontana but I still come out to get my oil change and other car issues addressed. They get you in and out rather quickly.
Paul is very knowledgeable and honest, I recommend him to all my friends and family as well as to you my google family.< /review>

<Text>My car suddenly started making loud noises, and then my check engine light came on, so I was concerned that it was something serious. Since it was right after Christmas I was also concerned about how much it would cost. I looked around online for someone locally and started reading the different reviews. They mentioned that this place was honest and did great work. When I got there, there were a few people ahead of me, and more kept showing up, it was also close to lunch time, so I was concerned that it would take long for my car to get checked and worked on. A few minutes later my car was lifted and looked at, and the manager Paul told me, that my issue was not serious, it was only the oxygen sensor that had come loose, and it would only cost $30 for them to have it fixed. It's true, the manager Paul is very honest! They could have made up a story and told me it was something more serious to charge me more, but he didn't. My car was quickly fixed, and sounds normal now. I can see why people take the time to write good reviews about this place. I'd highly recommend them!< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< review>
Took my car in after I heard some weird metal scraping noise in my engine and saw my engine light go on. I was honestly expecting to pay up a couple hundred for some big replacement job. Paul (owner) asked some questions, said he'll look into it and ten minutes later called me to tell me he found a stick under my car by my axle and that the light was on just for an oil change. One of the few places where they won't upsell or say some BS. He was honest, straight to the point and did the work quickly.< /review>

The guys at this shop always take care of us.  I trust them to be honest and to give fair prices.  Most times, low prices. Paul (Owner) is friendly, knowledgeable, and fast.  He gives us options for the work being done, and that really helps ease the stress of even having to deal with maintenance and repairs.  Express General Auto Repair will continue to be our stop for our vehicle care and repair.</Text>

<text>Paul is the best.. He and the boys do a good job. He's super cool dude straight to the point and honest. He let's you know what you'll need soon and doesn't pressure you to get it done with him. Place is always busy so come with enough time to spare don't expect to show up and get treated right away. Hell ask what you need but then usually they're working on cars already. The boys do move fast tho and I sense no laziness at all good shop have been going here for years. Burger spot right next door too if you're hungry haha.</text>< gmap_id>

I don’t think they know what they are doing. I’ve done oil change and a bit of coolant. My coolant color changed. So now I have to go to dealership and completely replace the coolant which cost 180 bucks. And I don’t know what oil do they use. It’s kinda annoying.</Text>

Paul has been with us through several cars, all different makes and models.  He is always open, honest and frank about what is wrong with the car.  His recommendations are fair and I appreciate his reliability.  It helps that your car is always ready when they say it's going to be ready.  My husband and I trust him tremendously.</review>

<review>I have been there several times to pawn my property for short term cash loans. I’m no stranger to pawning property for quick loans and know they are the best around. The best in Orange County per my experience. They are always fair and professional. Pawning is the oldest form of credit and they do it best. I have brought the same things (guitar and equipment) and they keep excellent records such that I’m loaned the same amount regardless of who at the counter helps me. Each employee is knowledgeable and incredibly helpful. Easy in and easy out. Also worth noting is they are not pawn snobs. In other words, they don’t devalue you property before they check it out. I have even bought some of the merchandise they sell too. Give them a try.</review></record>

<Text>Lincoln Pawn, is one of the best pawn shops I have come across.  The staff is friendly & always welcoming. They do good business & are one of the most honest & trust worthy pawn shops in the orange county area. Which is very important when working with a pawn shop. There selection of merchandise & prices are awesome. I recommend Lincoln Pawn, above all.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Really like going there to pawn stuff when I need to. The staff is always friendly and helpful, get acknowledged right when I walk in, and they are pretty much always helping when they are able to. Never had a bad experience or felt ashamed going there. Pawn here you won’t regret it.< /Review>

This pawn shop I've been going to for years they are the best that I've ever been to. They treat you with respect have fair prices and will work with you. I recommend them highly if you need a loan and if you're just out the shop they have quite a variety of items to choose from and have fair prices! Stop by and check them out!<//Text>

<review>I have used Lincoln Pawn as my exclusive pawn shop for years. The guys that work there are always friendly, fair and honest.  Jessie especially always takes care of me and gives me the best deals so efficiently and in a timely manner.  Whether you are buying, pawning or selling all of the guys at Lincoln Pawn will take care of you better than any other shop in So Cal and give you the best prices.<//review>< pics>

It’s open when I need it. The people working were courteous and attentive. They listened to my needs and were so accommodating, they helped me find exactly what I wanted, and for a better price than I thought possible.< /text>

Literally the only pawn shop I found that seems to be able to read people. And have compassion..  I'm gonna leave the most honest review I probably ever could. It felt like they understand sometimes people need to not so much pawn but use the value of the items we purchase.  And in return let us barrow what we need and I would hope you all return to get your products back. But in any sense I got the value and trust from the workers. I needed at the time I needed it most!!! 🥰< /review>

<Review>I almost feel like i am a family member. The store is always clean and every person treats me like i matter. They call me by my name and are very profesional. I have never felt as they were trying to beat me out of every dollar like some loan shops. The only loan shop i will ever use.
Thank you Lincoln Pawn.

The place was very clean but he sure wasn’t doing me a favor but then again he did give me something which is better than nothing. Overall it’s what you would expect from a decent pawn shop.< /review>

Everyone is helpful and extraordinary happy.  They make all efforts to satisfy their customers.   Make sure you visits this one in Oeange County.   You get more bucks for your chicks.  In my Ice Cube voice.

These guys are professional and friendly. If you have something of value, they will work to try and get you the most for your items. I have been dealing with them for a couple years now when I'm in a financial pinch and they always come through.<//Text>

I have never run across a crew of better Suited well mannered courteous and helpful OC Bros in my life. These guys take the time to help you with things that you can't find in a pawn shop you may be able to sell it may be able to buy these guys give gifts man in a form of their time they're understanding their patience and their know how!

<rate>5</rate><Review>The gentlemen at Lincoln Pawn are awesome professionals who have obviously taken steps to make doing business with them easier, convenient and hassle free. Although that sounds “salesy” it’s absolutely true. Just by allowing payments to be made electronically, it takes the hassle and worry out of staying on top of time sensitive dates where interest and payoff dates can be worrisome. And they are reassuring and they work with you to satisfy your business objectives and that makes me happy to do business with them anytime - and I recommend them to friends because of their ability and desire to work with me whenever I am in need. Great shop, great service and no bs.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Our experience has been excellent since day one. They are a terrific group of people. Friendly, professional & they worked with us during a very difficult time.
Also, they have done an excellent job of transitioning to doing business in line with the stay at home/no contact requirements. They've done their share & more.
We could all take a page from their book.<//review>

I trusted them with my ring. I had to pay rent so I got a Loan from them. I contacted them to inquire my balance and they gave it to me. I didn’t have it all quite yet so I called again today and they sold it. They sold it with no warning. Not only was that my memories, but the only thing valuable that I had. These people are horrible! I do not recommend them!!!<//text>

Al, the owner, is one of the fairest and best to work with. I’ve utilized his services on and off for over 6yrs, even driving to Lincoln Pawn after I moved out of the county,  based on how him and his whole staff have treated me. Also love shopping there. If you must pawn, highly recommend!</Text>

<review>I’ve been here a few times when in a bind. Always super friendly, professional and a quick transaction . My property is never tampered with and the loan amount was higher than any other place I went in the area when initially looking around for quotes. I trust them and know when I’m in a pinch I can count on this place.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1583439252395, 'text': 'Thank you very much for the review!

<name>Sunnyside Up<//name><Time>1561840538034</Time><Rate>3</Rate><Review>I thought customer service was good. I wanted to sell a ring that was made for me by a jeweler and I was given a ridiculous price for it to sell. It was mine and genuine. It was a combination of an engagement ring 1/4 KT diamond and small opals from another ring I owned that was set in 14kt and platinum setting. Jeweler made the mold himself. Originally Engagement ring was in platinum setting opals were set in 14 KT gold. Customer service Rep only offered me $25.00. It was not a cheap ring. I paid $350 to have it made. The diamond alone is worth at least 250.00 to $300. The rep made me feel I wanted to sell him junk. Diamond ring was purchased 1952. It was as a family heirloom. I did not sell it I decided to keep the ring. Its like an omen shown to me not to sell it. Its best to know what is valuable and don't sell out for less money.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>I have been going to Lincoln pawn shop for quite some time now , and during this covid crazy time, I have had to visit but yet once again! Some times finances aren’t so great and I take the only one item that is of some value and borrow some cash untill payday! course you have to pay back a little extra, but to me it’s so much better than having my lights turned off or running out of gas or being hungry! I only have a few things of any value and my earnings are one of them and my mom always said that as long as you own a diamond you will never go hungry and that is so the truth! When I went to the pawn shop I already felt like a failure and sort of an embarrassment to myself to be at my age and have to borrow money from a pawn shop with my jewelery but these guys never once made me feel anything less than a reglar customer doing business like everyone else! And I go in there quite often and they have such great customer service skills all the time! In fact I was just there today and they told me that I didn’t even need to show my identification cards because they already know me that well!!!!! I will always return to Lincoln Pawn Shop. Even with a phone call they let you come in a little late but they always work with you! So thank you to the staff at Lincoln pawn you guys are so great at what you do and as always I am a happy customer! You</Review>< pictures>

I have been going to lincoln pawn shop from when they first open. I have gotten many things from changers drill batterys coins and a few other items. Every time i go there i have been treated like family they may look young but they all know there the value of the merchandise they are fair and the wont try to get over on you. You got to go there and see it for yourself. Lincoln pawn is the only pawn i will go to. Thanks guys for taking care of me when i needed a few buck. You guys are 6 stars but they only have five. Big mike.😉</review>

The place is great! Something special for everyone, like treasure hunting you never know what you find out, and the price is negotiable and reasonable. Must see!< /Text>

(Update: 04/09/2021)
Years later, they are still the best around. Great staff, very knowledgeable on what they have in the store, and they're willing to work with you and your needs. Great selection of electronics for my needs.  If I'm looking for a great deal on a laptop, this is the 1st place I go to.

Very friendly, very fair on loans, great prices on lots of stuff... especially electronics (laptops, phones, etc...). It's one place I love to check into every few weeks to see what they've gotten in.

My advice; whatever your reason to visit a pawn shop go there first, you won't be disappointed. If you're going there to shop and you see something you like, put it on layaway because chances are if you go back a few days later, it would have already been sold.< /text>

Not your typical pawn shop where they ask how much money you need, then offer you 10% of that. These guys are cool, fair and they treat you with respect. All other pawn shops could and should learn how to treat customers like they do here. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to borrow some cash for your stuff, this is the place to go. Trust me!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I went in today when I saw the sign holder as I was on my way to another pawn shop that I use in Anaheim.  I am really glad I stopped here cause the service was really friendly and they offered me more money than a place that I have been using for years.  Also, this doesn't feel like the other pawn shops in Anaheim, it is really clean and nice.< /text>

The manager and the staff are pretty good at what they do. Only thing that bothers me is their way to reason with a customer. My wife and I have jewelry at this place. Their policy is that only the person on the ticket can retrieve bthier property. Well my wife is at the hospital and they won't comply.< /text>

I've tried all the pawn shops in the area these guys are the best. All the other's, dusty junk filled joints are ran by unscrupulous bums lowballing people when their in a pinch. the worst is the place on Euclid, a block down from the 91 freeway the owner.... save gas and just go to Lincoln Pawn Shop for a loan.</Review>

Unpleasant. Greedy. I pawned my tools one year ago at Rocky's Pawn for two hundred and fifty. This pawn shop only wanted to pick and choose and only offered $75.00. I explained to the manager about my new job and all the hell my went through to get back on my feet. Uncaring, un compasionate. Dont do business we these people.</review>

(Translated by Google) It is the best pawn shop, they are very friendly, attentive in dealing with customers.
I feel calm ... because my jewelry is safe.
Quite accessible the interest.
I highly recommend it

(Original)
Es el mejor lugar de empeno, son muy amables, atentos en el trato a los clientes.
Me siento tranquila...pues mis joyas estan seguras.
Bastante accesible el interes.
Lo recomiendo ampliamente</Text>

Vik's Chaat was the only place I knew of to get my dosa/south indian fix without having to drive 45mins to an hour to Milpitas/Sunnyvale. Really glad to have found Udupi palace for all my favorites — dosas, idli, vada, uthapams etc<//review>

Best Indian restaurant I’ve ever been to. Wonderful dosa with vegetable curry and stir-fried paratha special. Service was excellent. I cannot wait to come back to try other items on the menu.</text>

What does a person have to do to get some rice with our orders? We've ordered twice now from this restaurant and the first time we didn't get any rice with our food and we thought that perhaps we needed to explicitly ask for it but when we did that on our second order, a few weeks later, and NO rice was given we decided we'll never order from this place again. Honestly, the food is just ok. My wife, the vegetarian, liked it better than I did but even she said she's had better. Hard pass.<//Review>

<name>pavan kumar n c< /name><Time>1620610324337< /Time><Rate>2<//Rate><text>I used to frequent here a couple of years ago and liked the authenticity in the South Indian taste. However on my visit today, ordered South Indian thali, pongal,  bele bath, gajar halwa : thali was not even close to any South Indian taste, pongal didn’t have either cumin or pepper corns (and tasted creamy like Kheer), bisi bele bath was a sambar powder mix with some rice, and gajar halwa tasted exactly like frozen store bought stuff. Something is clearly wrong with the chef or the style of cooking. One extra star for giving the order on time.</text>< Pictures>

Large portions, big enough to share. Chai was okay, it was weak. Idli is good. spinach masala dosa was good, wish it was less oily. In all, this udupi seems slightly better than the one in SF.<//Text>

<review>Tasty, casual Indian specializing in dosas. The entirely vegetarian menu makes this spot great for vegetarians and vegans who want to try a new Indian dish. They also aren't afraid of spice, so if you order something spicy it should satisfy all but the most extreme hot-heads.</review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Traditional South Indian Food for Vegetarians.  3.5 stars for the food;  2.5 stars for the service and atmosphere.  My favorite dish is #49 Saag Paneer ordered with "medium" spiciness when I have a craving for spinach.   The service can be very uneven when they are crowded; the environment is noisy, cramped, and very "cheap" feeling.< /review>< userid>

Even though the dosa itself was good, the chutneys and sambar served with it were really bad. Sambar was very watery and  tasteless. Very disappointed. Medhu vada was very oily as well.< /review>

This is easily my favorite poke place in the south bay. They have a great selection of fish and I especially appreciate that they have a spicy crab option. They also have a good variety of sauces and toppings to choose from. The staff is great too and is always welcoming when I go.</Text>

< Review>
Gluten free poke! That's astoundingly hard to find in this area, since a lot of poke fish comes pre-dressed in sauce. The "build your own" option here is incredible because every ingredient is specifically listed for allergens! There are also tons of topping options and sauces. In light of the pandemic, we've gotten takeout and delivery from Poke Poke pretty frequently, and it's always well packaged and fresh. The value is great for the quantity of fish you get - I've never gotten the chipotle feeling of "damn, those portion spoons were small today ". Love Poke Poke and can't wait to come back soon!< /Review>

Better than other poke places we’ve tried in the area. The fish is fresher and the price is lower?!? The have great toppings and while many are similar, some are different like the tempura flakes which add a nice crunch! I do wish they had avocado but it’s easy enough to add our own avocado at home!< /Text>

Lots of options to customize your fish bowl, from a wide variety of sauces to all manner of crunchy toppings. Of course you pay a premium for avocado, but that's pretty normal and totally worth it. Portions are generous for the price, and the staff is nice and efficient. Overall a great spot for a quick and tasty lunch. Will be back to try more!< /Text>

The best Poke restaurant in the south bay. I almost exclusively just come here for poke now. Consistently fresh, great clean mix of ingredients and sauce. They are also very fast. Ordering from GrubHub or Doordash, the order is typically ready in a flash.</review>

I have been to this place so many times, it's ridiculous. Why? Because it's freaking awesome!

These bowls are made with fresh ingredients and the portion sizes are perfect for either lunch or dinner. They offer several varieties of fish, including plain poke, salmon, octopus and out favorite, the deliciously marinated house poke. Also, there are toppings for everyone, whether you like sweet, salty, crunchy or tangy... They have it all!

I can't seem to get enough of this place, and with their rewards program, I've already earned a bowl or two.</review>

<review>Where do I start?  Since this is a poke place, let’s start with the fish. It was very tasty. The Hawaiian blend was flavorful and the tuna with the house sauce was also very great good. Then, you are on your way to customize with all kinds of delicious toppings. Oh, I forgot the base. I had the yam noodles and it had a very nice texture. The blindness of the noodle was actually perfect to go with the very strong flavors of the poke and the toppings. Would be back!!</review>< Pictures>

If you love sushi, you are going to love poke.  It's like a Chipotle, but for sushi.  You start with a Bowl of sushi rice (brown rice and veggie option also available) and then add the various types of sushi, sauces and toppings like seaweed. The fish is fresh and overall quality is really good.  I've been a dozen times in the last two months.  What's most surprising is this is the only one in the greater KC area that I know of.  These poke bars are all over California, Chicago, Dallas and other major metros.<//Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Good poke spot. I've been to most of the ones around the bay area, and this is pretty standard - no avo or seaweed if you're averse to paying extra. Fish is fresh. It's nice and clean, though tables might be hard to snag during peak hours. They have a loyalty program: It's digital, so you don't need to carry another stamp card, though their tablet was snail-like last time I went.</review>< Pictures>

Poke poke has fast service and the traditional offerings you'd expect at a poke build your own bowl shop. The sauces offer a different variety than other places I've been in the area including gochujang which has some kick. The green tea ($1.95) is great with their three fish bowl option ($11.95). I always opt for the yam noodles but follow your heart. Overall consistent and good value but not overly memorable.< /review>

I have two favorite poke places: Pokehouse and Go Fish. PokePoke is definitely a very close runner up.

SERVICE
It was my first time here and after I started asking what the fish were the person who helped me noticed that I was unfamiliar and was very through with me until the end when I got my toppings. I want to say the service here is excellent, compared to Pokehouse where they get so many orders that they just don't care and wait for you to figure it out yourself. At PokePoke, my server started listing all that they had toppings wise because there weren't signage nor were they easily identifiable. I think that small notion of trying to be helpful got to me. I usually don't tip the first time I go places and usually tip my 2nd time around but this was one of the few places I tipped on the first visit and a bit extra too.

FOOD QUALITY
I am in LOVE with the yam noodles here. It is incomparable to GoFish. PokePoke has the best yam noodles hands down. Pokehouse doesn't even have that option.
My fish weren't warm and the toppings were plentiful in variety; HOWEVER I wish it were the same with the protein. I love octopus and tofu options and sadly they didn't have it. I did notice that they had both regular and spicy crab salad, and yellowtail which is very nice. Unagi would've been a great addition too but that's more difficult as opposed to the traditional ahi and salmon. I adored their little sauce list too, although I wish they added sauce to the yam noodles as they were quite bland for me. Honestly, if their were more variety with protein, (for toppings they had cheetos and carrot/daikon which are unique and I love it) this would be my #1 go to.

Everytime my portion fell out the small scoop my server would always go back and scoop up what fell with a bit more. And it's such a small gesture but the fact it happened at all makes me grateful. I DEFINITELY will come back sometime soon.</text>

Giving it 4 stars cox their $1 avocado add on for the poke is all precut and have turned brown and they don't have staff members to clean the tables after people leave. And I wish they mix their poke bowl instead of just scooping the stuff on. It was super popular. The whole time I was there the line hadn't stopped.</review>< pictures>

<Text>I got salmon and tofu with edamame. It tastes very fresh. This place is like Japanese chipotle. You choose any meat and toppings for one price. What's funny is when I was choosing some of the ingredients, there are two different sliced cucumbers that you can choose from. Also, I recommend getting all the toppings. There's also extra wonton strips near the sauce area if you want more after eating half way. Would come here again.< /Text>< pictures>

What's funny is when I was choosing some of the ingredients, there are two different sliced cucumbers that you can choose from. Also, I recommend getting all the toppings. There's also extra wonton strips near the sauce area if you want more after eating half way. Would come here again.<//review>

<Text>Came for the first time the other day.  Tried to order online through Yelp, but I was having difficulties so I called to see if they were open.  They were open, but apparently there have been issues with online ordering from certain browsers.  She recommended ordering through the Doordash or Uber eats apps, but the cutoff for online orders was at 7pm, an hour before they were closing.  I decided to just do a walk in order and I was in and out in less than 10 minutes.  It took me a little longer because I had to think about what I wanted in the bowls and the options that were available.  Great service and the food was also delicious. Will definitely be coming back!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This place is so good. The OMG sauce is great, and the various crispy toppings one can add make the three fish bowls seriously addictive.< /review>

This place is my number one restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I favor it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to that place. Whenever  I feel like having a decent dinner, this is the place that comes right away to my head. extremely good and   food and a large list of dishes.helpful team, and great ambience. In addition to that, the bill is affordable. I suggest this restaurant with no doubt.</Text>

<Review>Had the spicy salmon poke bowl with sushi rice.  Ingredients tasted fresh.  Had the order to go; food came very quickly.  The preparation speed however did not compromise the quality: the ingredients did not appear to be thrown in a ball of mess, it looked very appetizing.  Prices are par with this type of restaurant.  A nice poke place if you're in the mood for it.  I would recommend this place and return if ever in the area again.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><Time>1568953858217< /Time><UserId.>112385964224864664931</UserId.></record>

Delicious, FRESH, large portion, well priced, really quick even if there's a line and lots of toppings. Poke Poke is a really easy review to write, since it's the perfect "healthier" lunch option for lots of people. It's hard to beat the amount of food you get here for the money and it's very tasty.

Highly recommended!</Text>

<review>Fresh ingredients, great selections. Ordered their special, hamachi kama, it was moist and not over seasoned. Giving it 4 stars cox their $1 avocado add on for the poke is all precut and have turned brown and they don't have staff members to clean the tables after people leave. And I wish they mix their poke bowl instead of just scooping the stuff on. It was super popular. The whole time I was there the line hadn't stopped.< /review>< Pictures>

Fish is always fresh, service is always quick, and menu is simple.  Definitely one of my favorite poke spots.  Note that the parking here during the lunch rush is very limited.</text>

< Review>
Food was good but not worth the price (cheaper poke elsewhere in the area that's just as great). Pricing on their menu was completely off so I was surprised with the total when I got my bill. They had a special that clearly stated that you could order a 4 piece California or spicy tuna roll for $2 so I asked to add one to my order. When the cashier rang up my total, it was $28! For one bowl and a 4 piece California roll. When I asked the cashier about it, she was completely confused and then said "oh you can get two of the 4 pieces for that price". Why she didn't say that to begin with, who knows?! Parking is also nearly impossible in the area that it's located at. Good luck getting a spot during lunch.</Review>

<text>This place has really good food it's just really really frustrating that they change the hours randomly. sometimes at night I drive there from work to get food and then I get to the door and it's closed even though online it says it's open. I feel like they should somehow state online that they change their hours temporarily, because it definitely made me reconsider coming here as often as I do.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Love this poke place! I live nearby and frequently visit this restaurant. It's always super quick and they give generous portions. Their Hawaiian style fish is delicious and I like that they offer mango as a topping and lots of sauce options. I've been to a couple poke places in the area and I think this spot has the most generous portions sizes for the price.</Text>< pics>

If you love fresh poke, this is the place to be. As an Ahi lover this to me is one of the top places in Santa Clara to get a great bowl.<//Text>

Having raw fish in this way is dangerous

• It's annoying making customer to appoint all the food ingredients in the bowl.

•What I need is making it simple or just show me the order number.

• I bought two boxes to-go, then my family was suffering diarrhea after eating them.<//review>

< Review>
This was my first experience with a poke poke bar. I found the experience at this location to be a bit confusing and hard to get unconfused because it’s so noisy inside. Eventually I just nodded to whatever they asked me because there were so many people talking at once I couldn’t hear. The food was tasty but ended up costing more than I expected and less food. It’s probably due to the things they were asking that I couldn’t hear.</Review>

Super nice place. The food was delicious, very fresh and the service was incredible. They had overhead that it was our first time so they threw in a free appetizer. They have very good food options and they even have free hot Cheetos in the sauce bar. Totally coming back.</Review>

Loved a small authentic Poke place.
Reasonably priced, clean,  and very tasty.

The area is kinda depressing as most of the bay area once you get out of San Francisco. It all feels like a huge parking lot< /Review>

On the evening of July 7 I walked in and asked the young woman behind the counter if it was safe for me to eat there, as I have a shellfish allergy. The employee told me that they don't serve shellfish. I then pointed to the crab (and other shellfish), and a second employee said, "well that's complimentary."

Needless to say, I left.

Please train your staff! It's OK to have a restaurant that isn't safe for people with allergies - some places are more prone to cross-contamination than others.

It's dangerous and negligent to have employees this untrained.<//Review>

<Review>I absolutely love this place. Since discovering this location I've been coming here every Friday.

Yes they have raised their prices but it was because minimum wage went up and they didn't want to sacrifice the quality of service or food. And it's still worth it. $14 for a very large bowl of poke and they often give you huge scoops of meat

The best part is they have 4 different kinds of "crunchies" which are fried tempura cracker bits. Yum< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Although there may be many poke places now around the bay area, this place serves a great variety of fishes and has many different options for toppings!

For a poke bowl, price can range from $11-15 for a regular bowl (depending if you want additional items). They also have house specials and allow you to sample the fishes or flavors if you would like. If you get a poke bowl, you can choose between brown rice, mixed greens, or half brown rice and half mixed green, 3 fishes/shrimp, and unlimited toppings.
I would suggest to sample he house special for one of the options of fishes. I loved it! They also have variety of sauces and add more toppings after you finish your bowl. Toppings may include furikake, tofu crunches, garlic crunches and more (sorry, I'm not sure what those "crouton-like" toppings are called)! Great seating area with lots of tables compared to other poke bowl places and amazing customer service! My friends and I came around 1 P.M. on a weekday and you can definitely tell the place gets packed during lunch hours and dinner time.< /review>

<review>This place offers fresh, good poke for a decent price, even with the recent raise in the price. They also now offer sushi rolls on some days, so be sure to follow them on Instagram to get updates (that's how I know when to go).

They offer crab (spicy or regular) with every bowl, which is nice, and they have a large selection of sauces.

They also offer chilled yam noodles and salad in place of rice for a low carb option.<//review>< userid>

They cut their fish into slightly smaller bites so you get more bites with fish, but the same amount overall. They also have cucumber twice in the toppings line, which I love. They're sauces are better than most places, with several delicious options. The bowls are good sizes, and not "boxes" like some places have.

<time>1489576335604< /time><review>After having my eye out for this place a long time, I finally made a visit.

For approx $11, you get a customized bowl of your three protein option with toppings of your hearts desire. For my choice, I ended up getting hamachi, salmon, and tuna with their house sauce (I also asked for the garlic onion sauce on the side to try it out). For toppings, you have a wide variety similar to other poke places. My bowl came out exceptionally delicious! The house sauce was spectacular, pair it with the onion garlic and it goes above and beyond expectations. The proteins and toppings were fresh, even the greens were crisp. The bowl was filling and definitely worth the money.  I also liked the condiments bar to the side as I topped it off with more stuff at the end.<//review><rating>4< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>It was my first poke of 2018 and my expectations were high. Luckily poke poke didn’t disappoint and we had a delicious meal. An ingredient of not has to be their “house poke”, it was delicious!! One recommendation would be to relax on the EDM music in the place. The food is so good you want to focus in on it, hard to do with rave music blasting in the background.</review><Gmap_id>0x808fca4054e7532f:0x26ccd720bf39daa4<//Gmap_id>< rate>

Decent food. Fast service. Not the best of ingredient choices. Not the best for a vegetarian who doesn't eat soy products.< /Review>

Just like many others have said, it's a good portion for what you pay. It's $13 for a bowl, but you get 3 scoops of any fish. I added all the toppings (minus the avocado and seaweed salad, which cost extra), and it lasted me two meals. When I went, the tables were a little dirty, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. However, it seems most people choose to get it to go.<//Text>

This is my absolute favorite poke place ever, to the extent that it has ruined other poke restaurants for me. : P Still worth it! Fairly priced poke bowls with fresh fish and an excellent assortment of toppings including kimchi, seaweed salad, and crispy onions. The House sauce and the garlic emulsion are also wonderful. Folks who work there are kind and friendly.<//Text>

Lovely poke offerings; this is the first I've seen offering yam noodles (clear noodles, low-carb, chilled for a perfect hot weather bowl)! Yum. Shared parking lot had room when I was there one early evening; more seating room than some places. Love it!< /review>

They had a price increase, but the owner was transparent to say that they did not want to lower the quality of food.

Quality has always been consistent. Portion size is great for just 15$.

I've been to a lot of poke places, but this one has got their act together! The service is really fast because the staff asks questions such as "would you like any cucumber, green peppers and furikake?  Would you like salmon and tuna?  Avocado and seaweed salad?"  Etc. Etc.  The questions are helpful and efficient because customers don't have to stare at the toppings and try to figure out what the toppings are.

As for the food itself, it has gotta be one of the best poke places I've tried in the Bay Area.  Everything is EXTREMELY fresh and not mushy in any way.  The vegetables are sweet and crunchy, and the fish doesn't smell fishy at all.  The sauces go well together and they have a side bar where you are free to add as many extra crunchy toppings as you'd like.  The side bar contains extra spicy mayo sauce, furikake, and other sauces that you can add yourself if you feel like their servers didn't add enough - Also great because you don't need to go back to the servers to ask them to add more!

I think this is by far the most efficiently set up poke joint I've visited.  The delicious, fresh food is one of the reasons why I'll be sure to visit this place again!< /review>

It wasn't too bad. I no longer live in the area and my wife misses the poke! I opted for sushi rolls and they were average. Not bad, but definitely not the best.<//Text>

The fish was fresh and had a good selection of add ons. Pricing is typical of most poke places. However, parking can get tricky since it's right off of San Thomas and shares a plaza with a bunch of other popular restaurants.<//review>

Fast and friendly service, great portions, and deliciously fresh fish/toppings. Also, they get bonus points for serving yam noodles, because every poke place should have that stuff but many do not unfortunately.</Review>

<Review>This was my go-to poke place for the last 3 months... that is, until last night. The last two visits were atrocious, thus I'm downgrading my rating. Poke Poke Fish Bar started out strong. Portion size was large; their sauces are really good. Toppings weren't anything to write home about, but you can't win everything. But recently, they have been very inconsistent. Maybe it's because they've been training a few new people. But the portion I got last night was at least 25% less than usual. That's not okay. There were like maybe 5-6 pieces of fish per scoop. There was less fish than rice. The previous time before that was even more alarming. The lady behind me got so much more fish (I saw the guy give her an extra half scoop) just because she was very familiar with some of the staff. Now, I don't deny that you get special treatment if you're a regular or a friend. But 1) the establishment shouldn't be so freaking blatant about it, and 2) I'm also a regular (case in point, I was cashing in my 12-point FiveStars perk that night). So what gives? Go somewhere else for your poke.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

My son introduced me to this place. I am embarrassed to admit that I had no idea what poke was (I've seen it on menues in Maui, but never cared to ask). But I love sashimi and mixing that with a green salad , some crab meat and pickled carrots kind of sounded like a great idea. Let's get real here... you will absolutely love this place. I seriously want to have this for lunch every day for the rest of my life. You pay about $12 for a bowl which includes 3 types of sashimi and the crab. You have a ton of free options and the base can be rice, noodle or salad plu a couple of other options.< /Text>

Pretty standard poke place with good portion sizes, fresh fish and toppings. Priced exactly where you'd expect. Parking lot is a bit small and could be a challenge.< /Review>

Love the 3 fish options and lots of green toppings including edamame Guacamole Masago etc $11, as good as Hawaiian poke bowl but with more twists.<//text>

Start with your base; there's rice, yam noodles, salad (maybe more, but I don't venture beyond this).  You can get dressing on your salad, and you have a choice between regular and spicy krab (yes, with a "K") meat.  Pick your poke and sauce; scoops are reasonably large, though maybe it's because the fish cubes look bigger than from some other places.  There are a multitude of toppings you can add, including  cucumber, onions, mango and kimchi, just to name a few.  Finish it off with crunchy toppings, such as fried won ton skins, tempura flakes/ and furikake.  What seems to set this place apart is that they really try to fill your bowl to the top, which is a refreshing change from the sometimes half full bowls that other places sometimes serve.  And there are actually a fair number of tables you can sit and enjoy your poke.

To top it all off, since this used to be a pinkberry, you can also get FroYo here.

The quality of the ingredients (i.e., fish) is pretty good; not necessarily the best around, but a strong contender.  Definitely worth a try if you are in the area and want some poke.<//review><pics>None< /pics></record>

(Translated by Google) I think the volume, taste and cost performance are the best Poke in this area. Be careful as parking lots may not be crowded.

この辺ではボリューム、味、コスパともに一番のPokeだと思う。駐車場が混雑して入れない時があるので要注意。< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The advantage is that there are many kinds of ingredients, the disadvantage is that no Poke Paradise is fresh, avacado wants to add money.

(Translated by Google) Poke is a Hawaiian dish with an arrangement of Japanese food.
The ordering method is divided into 5 sections, and you can order what you like for each section and make your favorite bowl.

1. Which carbohydrate should you use?
2, which main ingredient to use
3, what to source
4, what to garnish
(Do you take it home after telling the garnish?
Tell me if you want to eat here)
5, do you want a submenu?
(Desserts, drinks, etc.)

At lunchtime, there are long lanes so you can slowly look at the menu table on the wall while lining up.
What makes me happy at this restaurant is that some of the menu tables are written in Roman letters as they are (Hamachi, Octopus, etc.). Even though I haven't come to my mind about English yet, I could understand it. When you actually order, you may see the ingredients in front of you and change what you want to eat, so you can point to it and say "This one".

I enjoyed eating it as Hawaiian food. If you order it well, you can make something that is reasonably close to Japanese seafood bowls. I want to try it next time.

(Original)
Pokeは日本食をアレンジしたハワイ料理です。
オーダー方法は5つのセクションに別れていて セクションごとに好きなものをオーダーしてお好みの丼を作っていきます。

1、どの炭水化物にするか。
2、どのメインの具にするか
3、ソースは何にするか
4、付け合わせは何にするか
(付け合わせを伝えた後に持ち帰りか
ここで食べるかを伝える)
5、サブメニューはほしいか
(デザートや飲物など)

ランチタイムだと長いレーンができているので列に並んでいる間に壁に書かれているメニュー表をゆっくり見ることができます。
このお店で嬉しいのはメニュー表をよーく見ると一部ですが日本語がそのままローマ字表記にになっているものもありました(ハマチ、タコなど)。まだ英語がスラスラとまでは頭に入ってこない私でもそれなりに理解できました。実際に注文となると食材を目の前で見て食べたい物が変わったりもするので、指差して「This one」と言えばOK。

ハワイ料理として食べて楽しみました。上手くオーダーすればそこそこ日本の海鮮丼に近いのが作れると思います。次回試してみたいです。</text>

(Translated by Google) If you think that you want to eat Poke at home, I usually buy it here and go home. Basically it is the same as other Poke shops, it's a feeling of choosing the type of rice, the type of fish, sauce and toppings.

Period seems to be limited, but there are also Lobster. So this lobster is delicious, but we have to add a few dollars. It is good to decide while talking with your wallet as it is delicious.

Poke made is always delicious and there are volumes so if you buy two you will be over all four family members so I am thankful for that. (I think that it is slightly expensive.

(Original)
家で Poke が食べたいなと思ったらだいたいここで買って帰ります。基本的には他の Poke のお店と変わらない仕組みで、ご飯の種類と魚の種類とソースとトッピングを選ぶ感じです。

期間は限定のようですが Lobster もあったりします。で、このロブスターが美味しいんですが、数ドル追加しなければなりません。美味しいのでお財布と相談しながら決めるのが良いでしょう。

出来上がる Poke はいつも美味しいしボリュームがあるので２つ買うと 家族 4 人全員分以上になるのでそういう意味でもありがたい。（ちょっと高いとは思うけど。。<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Regular ball $ 10.95. It's really delicious with a full volume. Please note that the spicy tuna of the topping is as spicy as a demon.
