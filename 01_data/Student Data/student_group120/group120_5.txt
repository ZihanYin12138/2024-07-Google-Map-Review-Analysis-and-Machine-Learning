Wow! Could not be happier with their Pick Up and Delivery Service! I used Tiffany's Laundry to wash a king sized mattress cover that wouldn't fit into my washing machine at home. I scheduled my preferred pick up day/time through their website, a friendly driver came at the scheduled time to pick it up and the clean mattress cover was delivered back to me the next day! Seamless service! I will definitely be using them in the future, even though I have washer/dryer at home :) Thank you!</review>

<Review>The top load machines are a rip off. They have those weak Speed Queen washers that only have options for normal/hot, normal/warm, and delicates/cold. Each setting lowers the wash time. So color clothes get 2 min less time (20 min), or you ruin your colors using hot (22 min) or warm (21 min). And here is the kicker. As soon as i stared the washer, it went from 20 to 18 min, and it's only 1/3 full of water.</Review></record>

<text>I have used Tiffany's Laundry sporadically to take care of our laundry when we have events for my job. We normally have bags of towels in all shapes and sizes that require a good professional washing.  I can honestly say that their service is just wonderful every single time.  They are Excellent communicators, Friendly, dependable and fast. If we had the need to use them more often, I would certainly do so without a doubt. Ben is really nice and always helpful.  You can also schedule a pickup directly from their website, which I find super convenient. Whenever needed we will always use Tiffany's Laundry<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Clean laundry mat with lots of machines. $2 per load for top loading washers and $3.50 for large side load washers. $0.25 / 10 minutes of dry time and about 30 minutes will dry a load of whites completely but you'll have some damp towels if you are doing a large load with towels and sheets. There is free wifi and decent parking. There is a coin machine for snacks and laundry items like detergent and there is a convenience store one store down.<//text>

<review>Generally most machines work but they are not clean and the outsides are full of old mold and other materials. Some dryers work some do not. Random people just walk through the place the entire time you are there . If you go on a Saturday you’ll be lucky to get more than one machine. The place overall needs a good clean. Even the ceiling fans are full of dust.</review>< rating>

<Text>Clean, well priced, nice staff, good crowd, and a cheap corner store next door.  All in all pretty great.  I've had a few shirts ripped in fluff n fold and sometimes some machines are out of order hence the 4/5, but I still go there all the time.  Way better that the one that's half a block down.<//Text><user_name>Christian Woodward</user_name><user>104892337648297328713</user>< date>

<Review>I have yet to actually go into their laundromat. I needed some clothes washed before an upcoming photoshoot, so I explored google and yelp and came across Tiffany's! Owner was super responsive and came to pick up my laundry later in the day. Laundry was delivered back to us in less than 24 hours! AMAZING! My team and I will be back :)<//Review>< resp>

If I'm a paying customer and I'm there for hours doing laundry, why am I not allowed to use the restroom? I've been here before and have been allowed to. Today the laundress said customers were not allowed to use the restroom. She called the "owner" to ask and then said they said no. She gave me Ben's # and he called me back and said the bathroom was not operational and hasn't been for five years. LIES. I used it recently. Furthermore the laundress didn't say it was out of order, she said it wasn't for customers, and wouldn't have called the owner to ask if it was not operational. Looks like it's time to find a new laundromat.<//Review>

I love Tiffany's Laundry! Their fluff and fold service is a GAME CHANGER. Been using them for a couple months now and they've changed my life haha! No more stressing about laundry! Their pickup/delivery process is easy, they have good prices, my clothes always come back PERFECT and you can tell they actually care about the customer!< /Text>

This is a clean, safe, well located laundromat with good prices.  What more do you want?  If you're using their self-service laundry, you can walk to downtown Culver City and hang out while your clothes dry.  If you're like me and don't want to do your own laundry, have them do it.  I've used them for 10 years and they've ALWAYS been the cheapest.  AND, they've had the same employees for at least 10 years, which is a rarity these days.<//Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><date>1562494726452<//date><Review>Very dirty place. Plus they allow homeless folks to just hang out. Two attendants here and they do nothing. One guy smelling of alcohol and BO keeps wandering in and out and staring at the machines. Two more in the back of the place having a picnic. Not very safe feeling. Not coming back.  FYI, Ben I appreciate your willingness to help the homeless. I've volunteered on skid row with the Inner City Law Center.  I carry sleeping bags in my car and food for dogs and humans for that very reason. What I can't appreciate is, in allowing these folks in, you are allowing them to make a mess. Many homeless have mental illness and, since you yourself are not there, you are putting your clients in close proximity to chaos. This is not very respectful to the people paying money to clean their clothes. Yesterday the woman had food and all kinds of stuff on the table including a bottle of cheap, chemically based perfume - which she kept spraying liberally. I'm asthmatic and have been sick with a norovirus since Dec 23rd. I was trying to wash and dry my clothes not far from where they were (your place is very small). Meanwhile the attendants did nothing. There are other ways to help people then letting them camp out in your business. I don't know if allowing this helps you feel that you are a benevolent soul et or just negates your personal responsibility to your customers.  Your business, beyond that, needs a very good clean. There is dust and dirt everywhere. Seeing these folks spread out on the tables only made me think how unhygienic the place is considering it's just filthy in general.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba2bd693ede7:0x96db1f47a3700ff6<//Gmap_id>< name>

<review>The location, if you can find it, is set back in a little mini strip mall off of the main Boulevard. In addition it is not even called Tiffany's anymore, it is now fresh laundry. If this place was any harder to get to they would have no customers whatsoever also from the looks of the outside of the premises, it did not appear to have any machines inside at all. Way to invite business!!!<//review>< Pics>

There is very limited parking. The washers and dryers are kept clean, but are old. The big washers leave the clothes very damp upon end of wash so it takes more time and money to dry in the already  dryers that dont dry very well. It needs a lot of updates, pain floring lighting etc...It was okay as a one time emergency</Text>

< review>
I left an expensive wallet in my pants pocket and the little chubby guy who washes clothes stole it.  He also singed my blankets.  Owner is useless in resolving situations like these.  Don’t go here.< /review>

Tiffany's Laundry is the best fluff-n-fold I've found. Between their prices, their hours, and their friendly staff, I can't see myself going anywhere else.<//Text>

I went around 3pm on a Tuesday and there were plenty of open machines. My only complaint is that it was more expensive than I was expecting. The cheapest washing machines were $2.25 and they were tiny.</Review>< pics>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>We are VERY happy with the deal we got.  From the phone call letting us know about the sale, to the end agreement.  We dealt with several of the sales team and felt good about every interaction.  They got us the car, color, package we wanted for the price we wanted and took our 2021 for a good price.   Armand was awesome and walked us through the whole experience as quickly and efficiently as possible as we had our toddler with us.<//review>< gmapID>

Came in for a car I knew I wanted, and they got me a great deal, especially on the warranty. I was in there for maybe 2 hours before driving off with the car of my dreams. Talk to Max! Thanks guys.< /text>

How this place gets good reviews is beyond me.  Terrible customer service.  I rather have a root canal without anesthesia( which would be less painful than dealing with these people).  Run away!</Text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>I went to this place about 4 months ago looking for an automobile, Open till I got here I was turned down by several places until I met Theresa and she was awesome.  When I talk to Teresa I explained to her how much problems I had trying to get finance before and based on the information I gave her she assured me she would be able to finance which she did and now I have a really nice Chrysler 200.  Not only did she get me the vehicle that I wanted a they say what they mean and they mean what they say only reason I gave this place of 4 star was because there were some parts missing from my vehicle which were due to people walking on the lat. Taking stuff off of cars but again they replaced everything other than that if you look at for vehicle you're having a hard time getting finance I would highly recommend it house auto they are very good.</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

One of the best used car dealership I have visited. Didn't end up buying a car from them because they did't have the car I was looking for but the service I received from them was great specially the sales person Sam, I know he was an old man but very nice 🙂. I will definitely come back again .</review>

In house auto finance is awesome. I got one car in November from them and I crashed it in March. They was able to get me another car financed within that same week. I don't know many places that can get you a car financed that fast. I love In House Auto Finance and there customer service is amazing. I would recommend this dealership to everyone!!!!!

<text>I recently purchased a car at in house finance.  The sales people were nice and informative.  In the end Steve the manager was great he helped to find financing for me and allowed me to give my down in a 3 month window.   I want to thank all of them for their help... I'll be referring my friends to you :-)<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><date>1487822727691<//date><Rate>5</Rate>< resp>

<Text>I've purchased 2 cars from the Owner. Both run exceptionally well for many years. They were used so they had minor wear common with most used cars from previous owners. Beside that I've always been satisfied with the quality that I've received.

If you take the time to do your own research on vehicles, and choose the best vehicle for your use then you can get the most out of your cars. If you rely completely on the dealership to hand-hold you through every single step of car ownership, then I'm sorry to inform you life does not work this way. You must take responsibility and care of everything you purchase as a buyer.

If I ever had a problem or question about my vehicle, they've always been responsive or helpful which I find rare in a community of car dealerships.

Thank you,

Originally thought this place was great they wouldn't approve my fiancé and couldn't put us in a car because we were told they need a valid California license but when I go on their website it says they approve with out license I'm very disappointed and confused now? Missed out on a lot of money because of my transportation situation WOW!< /Text>

I would give these scam artist NO stars if it was possibly, these people are crooks they took advantage of me sold me a 2008 Hyundai lemon, the engine went out after 4months of me having it. They did nothing to accommodate me, the owner actually tried to tell me i owned them 600 dollars more after i called them and told them the engine went out but i had to remind him i paid full price cash money for the vehicle, then he told me to bring the car in and when i got there he told me the mechanic wasn't there to come back next week...moral of this story these people robbed me for my money and sold me a lemon, so im warning people to NEVER buy a vehicle from these crooks this place really need to be shut down immediately.<//text>

They don't tell you the truth and always find excuse. They don't care about the customer & it doesn't matter with them if you are happy or not.

After I posted my notes someone called me and he was very rude, and he mentioned that he is the owner and the vehicle which I am interesting in is at the dealer  for the maintenance while someone else told me that the car at the dealer to fix it. They are untruthful, don't go there or even contact them.<//Review>

He charged $270.00 to install a wal-Mart dvd radio worth $100. The employees at wal-mart said his labor was to expensive. He didn't install the emergency brake dvd player so that when the car is in park and the wife is in the grocery store and the kids are in the car with you, you can watch a movie while the car is in park. He told me it was California law, so he disabled that feature ,but tried to sale me a movie tv for $1000.00, plus he didn't want to use the bracket I got from Walmart for $15 and then charged me $35 for the ones he sold me. I gave him 4 stars because he was knowledgeable he may not of given me all the features I paid for. but GOD is good and California law does state not to have any obstruction while driving or operating a vehicle it doesn't say anything about it being in park. Walmart employees said it should be about $50 an hour especially since my car is older and doesn't have all that fancy stuff it should only take an hour to get stereo installed. He installed it good and I think he did a good job minus that one thing, so and I don't know about the cost averages but you can google that before making a purchase, so I give him 4 stars over all.</review>

Told them the stereo setup I wanted to run, even brought in the deck I'd already bought and they still helped me get everything else wiring-wise that I needed. GREAT customer service!< /Review>

Attention to detail not up to par with the price. Had to get two rental cars because they couldn't finish the job in one day. Some items weren't placed perfect to maximize space and fit with floor mats. Then had to go back for another half day because my center console vents weren't aligned. Still not the same. Only good thing about the experience was owner is very knowledgeable and honest. He stuck to a quote for a deck that was not in stock yet by giving me the old model price!</Review>

<Review>I had great service for an amazing price. Just sitting there to get my windows tinted they guys showed off their knowledge too. Other customers would walk in and point at their car and say I want speakers in that, the workers didn't second guess anything they would say the size of the speakers right away. They really know their stuff. I got both front windows on the truck tinted for $100, that's a great price for a lifetime warranty.< /Review><user_name>John< /user_name><user_id>117438313639178132268< /user_id>< Pictures>

Bought speakers and a stereo at Walmart they did an excellent and timely install of them. Went to 3 other places before I googled them. They are the first to not try to bully me into returning my equipment. They also were the only shop in town that had my stereo harness in stock and didn't have to order it. They were very nice, I did not have to wait at all. out of all 4 places I went to or called for a quote they were definitely priced better than 2 of the other places. out of all places I went to this places is my most recommended.<//review>

I don't know why they call themselves a business and opens their door. The attending lady needs emotional support for whatever issues she's going through...she doesn't seem to know any Indian product even though she's very Indian and never has the item(s) you're looking for. Most recultant place to make sell.<//text>

I celebrated my PhD yesterday in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that we enjoyed a fabulous evening and the venue was clearly the reason for the strong gathering. The crew  cooperated in a graceful style, the meals were yummy and my buddies were so  delighted. We shall surely return for more celebrations. thanks very much.</Review>

There are a different variety of items for purchase at this store. They also have fresh groceries in bulk like eggplants and onions. Take out food is also prepared for purchase which includes daal makhani and rothis. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking to get great customer service though.< /text>

< Review>
1st time we bought from this shop the jalebi was bad, there were little balls inside the jalebi and u could feel them when u eat them, but that wasn't a big deal because I know that people mess up. But I went there again to give them another change at their food quality. So then I bought samosas, but one again they messed up. The samosas were really over cocked also  the food inside the samosas was really bad. Like I have ate somasas before in my life but I have never seen that type of food inside a somasa. I have tried many different types of food from them ,to give them a change to prove me that the food is good, but they always mess up. So yeah my overall experience with the food quality was really bad.< /Review>

<Review>Love the doctors and assistants at Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital! They've cared for my two cats since their birth 4 years ago and also took care of their mom and dad cats! So calm and professional when dealing with my cats. I highly recommend anyone taking your beloved pet to Laguna Creek Vet!< /Review>< user_name>

Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital has been the vet for our dog for over 7years. We have continued to use their services as they are top notch! They treat our pet with love and respect and I always know that she is getting the best care.  They are very responsive to my questions and need to have my pet seen (worked into the schedule quickly). I would highly recommend them as a veterinary hospital.<//text>

The doctor was extremely helpful in explaining not only the process of recovery but the possible reasons why my dogs were experiencing their ear infections. She was very informative and was able to help us understand how to take better precautions in the future. I highly recommend this place.</Text>

<review>I was so relieved when I heard this place took small animals. My guinea pig was very sick, and I felt like Dr. Van Doren was really able to tell me a lot about her and helped get me the medicine I needed. I often feel like guinea pigs are looked over in some vet offices, but here I felt that my needs and my guinea pig’s needs were met here!<//review><GmapID>0x809ac89defe1054d:0xd80d163b42e6224f<//GmapID>< Pics>

Dr. Purwal and Dr. Vandoren are the absolute best. I started going here after bad experiences with some of our local VCA hospitals and I am happy I did. I feel they communicate my pets needs to me very well, and offer helpful suggestions to guide me down the path for my healthy pets, even if they are losing money! (by not performing unnecessary procedures) I have taken rabbits dogs and cats all into this vet hospital, and I will continue as long as they are in business. Thank you!!<//review>

I love Laguna Creek Vet Hospital.  I have been taking my fur babies to Laguna Creek for over 10 years, and I absolutely adore Dr. Van Doren and the staff.  Not only are they extremely professional, but they have always been considerate, thorough, compassionate, and understanding.  They have been supportive through the best and saddest of times, and I greatly value their dedication.  I still have the handwritten note that Lodi sent me when one of my fur babies crossed the rainbow bridge (thank you again, Lodi!).

I always highly recommend Laguna Creek to people looking for a vet.</Text>

Absolutely recommend bringing your furbabies here.  Recently, we brought our new family addition for a wellness check-up.  All was well.  COVID safety measures in full force (love that).  The vet was wonderful, informative and I can tell she truly loves what she does.  Same goes with other staff.  Other clients were also doing their part in staying safe.  This place has been here for quite a while and it really is your neighborhood pet clinic. ❤️.</Review>

<text>I have mixed experiences there. I call concerned about my dog and the conversations are pushy and abrupt, even rude at times. In my opinion a veterinarian office should have staff that is caring and kind. I care about my pet and I want to feel like they care too. The doctors I have met with were wonderful, it’s too bad the rest of the staff isn’t.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

A little weird having to wait outside but, that's the new normal. My kitty came home happy and didn't seem scared or stressed at all which tells me she was well cared for at the clinic. Especially having it be her first visit to the vet and having to get shots.<//review>

We (along with our cats and dogs) have been clients of Dr Purewal and LGV staff since he first opened his clinic in the 1990’s. Since then, his practice and staff have grown significantly.I know Laguna Creek Veterinary to be professional, compassionate and extremely competent. I give them my highest recommendation!< /Review>

I have been to other locations due to emergency check ups, but nothing compares to Laguna Creek Veterinary. Very attentive to our needs. As of recently, my dogs have been seen by Dr. Layton. She is very kind and caring. My dogs are very timid, but she knows how to keep them at ease. I definitely recommend this vet for your pet’s care and needs.<//Review>< Pictures>

Laguna Creek Vet Hospital has been wonderful to deal with. My cat had to have surgery to remove a cyst from her mouth, and LCVH has done everything they can during this scary time to keep my informed. They take special care to make sure my cat is comfortable and cared for. Even during a pandemic, I felt LCVH trying to make sure me and my cat received the best care while taking all the precautions necessary to keep their staff and our community safe.<//text>

All the staff and doctors at Laguna Creek Vet Hospital are amazing. I’ve had my yorkie since he was 8 weeks old and he’s 11 months now. I was referred to them by my sister who also takes her two dogs; a husky and German Shepard/husky mix there.

You can tell all of the staff and doctors there have a really genuine care for the animals they treat.<//Review>

<Text>I absolutely love Laguna Creek Veterinary Office. During these unprecedented times, I couldn’t be with my puppy for his first visit. The office staff were very friendly and explained the entire procedure and process for my puppy’s visit. I knew he would be in good hands when I gave him to the technician. Even though I haven’t had a chance to meet Dr. Purewal, he spent the time on the phone with me to explain my puppy’s check up and test results. I appreciated the time the doctor gave me. I would highly recommend Laguna Creek Veterinary’s Office.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I just want to say how much I love this place! My family moved out of Elk Grove to Citrus Heights but we continue and will in the future, continue to make the drive to this vet office. What they have done for my family I will never forget. Their Dr's are so competent they noticed a new heart condition on a dental check on my 12 year old Pit. Because she was concerned, we saw a cardiologist before they would do dental surgery, rather than just take my money and put my dogs life at risk. We got the appropriate consult and started her on a new medication, new food and overall healthier regimen. We rescheduled for dental surgery and they blocked out a large portion of their day on a friday to ensure they had all hands on deck in case something happened to her while she was under. Words can not describe how much this meant to me and our family. She and her adopted brother are safe, surgery was beautifully successful and the cost was astonishingly lower than any other vet I have ever visited. They have made a life long patient from our family. Thank you so much to all of their staff, you are truly the best.< /Review>< gmap_id>

The best $80 I've ever spent. I went in there thinking my baby leopard tortoise hatching was sick. I haven't had her long and it seemed what I thought were symptoms of a respiratory infection was normal behavior. The doctor said she was healthy and just needed a slight diet change. She also said I was doing a great job and was more knowledgeable than most first time owners. I was so worried my little baby was going to die, and with $80 I was told she's healthy and I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. Best money I ever spent.</text>

I have had great experiences with Laguna Creek Vet Hospital. We had a hard time finding an affordable vet who could do some dental surgery for one of our kitties. Unfortunately our kitty had to have surgery twice this year. The staff there is very friendly and they helped me get the best services I need at the most reasonable prices. This is our kitty Hanalei one day after surgery. I recommend them!<//review>

<text>They are NOT working dog friendly. As a professional handler we do not allow our dogs to be separated from us unless they are having surgery so shots and all are done with the handler. Never suggest sedating a working dog becuase when the handler is there the dog will be under control.
This place is not accommodating and rude. I will not recommend this vet to any of our units and other agencies<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

During this time we are not allowing pet owners to enter the building during appointments. This is a tough decision to make, as we understand that it can be stressful to be parted from one's furry companion, but it is necessary in order to ensure the health of our team, as well as our clients, like yourself. You will find that most, if not all, pet care facilities have adopted the same policies. It is disappointing to know we did not meet your care expectations and we wish you all the best in your search for care that best suits your needs. Thank you."}< /response>

<Text>My yorkie gets his routine check ups yearly with Dr. Van Doren. She is great!  She listens to my concerns and helped me solve his itchy skin.

I recently had an emergency with my senior dog. He was having a hard time breathing and had a bloated belly. They sent me to Vista animal hospital for the emergency, which I understood due to the situation.  After preliminary testing and no exact diagnosis from l Vista, the doctors at Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital reviewed my dog’s notes and got me in early to treat my dog immediately. I was scheduled with Dr. Purewall and he was so caring and understanding. He and Dr. Van Doren had discussed a treatment plan and were ready to treat my dog and get him more comfortable.  Dr. Purewall showed the upmost empathy for my dog and stayed during his lunch to perform a procedure on him. I am so so grateful for all the doctors and staff at Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital. They saved my dog and I know he’s getting the best care.

Everyone at Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital truly care about your animals. They are smart and work as a team to do what’s best for you and your animal. Thank you Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital!<//Text></record>

<Time>1546905923074< /Time><Pics>None< /Pics><user_name>Nicole Eagan< /user_name><Rating>4</Rating><Text>We recently adopted a puppy, so we needed to schedule her for an initial exam. We took her to another vet, and were very disappointed with the doctor. I decided to take her to another vet to get an actual exam, and after calling around I made an appointment with Laguna Creek. The front office staff was very friendly when I called, and again friendly the day of our appointment.

We saw Dr. Purewal for the exam, and he was fantastic! He did a thorough exam of our pup, and because we're first time dog owners, he took time to share all sorts of helpful information and answer all of our questions. What was even more impressive, my 10 year old daughter came to the appointment with me, and he explained everything to her, as well.

All of this was worth 5 stars, but I had to deduct one star. I called a few days later to schedule an appointment because my pup had injured her leg and was limping. I called on a Thursday morning, and the soonest they could see her was Monday. Obviously we couldn't wait that long, so I had to take her to another vet. It would be nice if they were able to schedule same day or next day appointments for something that requires immediate attention.< /Text><userid>105880143103339908974<//userid></record>

Mia warmed up to the staff quickly and was letting them touch her all over without any complaints, or reactions. The overall experience was very positive from the minute we arrived, until the time I was checked out.

My Pom Joey had his first visit to Laguna Creek Vet yesterday.  The folks there are animal lovers and will fuss over your pet.  They gave him treats so they’re his new bffs!  The vet was very kind and gentle, Joey liked her a lot.  I would highly recommend Laguna Creek Vet!<//Review>

<Review>Love the vets and all of the staff. Always helpful and they never make me feel bad about my dog being 'loud'. I call in the morning and can pick up my dog's bravecto that afternoon. And my appointment reminder cards have a picture of a schnauzer on them. That is the level of service. Your appointment cards have pictures of your dog breed on them.

The staff and doctors at Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital are amazing. Our dog had surgery yesterday. They called and updated us during the day and called today to check on our dog. They explained everything. They did a fabulous job! Thank you for taking such good care of our Delilah!</review>

<text>Brought my pup into Laguna Creek Vet Hospital with no appt as she was bleeding pretty badly. They welcomed us in and immediately took care of her. They were very compassionate and thorough and gave us clear instructions.  I feel like the costs are very  moderate for a vet. If you need to make payments, they tell you how can do that.<//text>< Rating>

This is our first visit to this office. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, and the waiting area is clean and neat.  Dr. Van Doren was very pleasant and professional as she examined our pet  and explained treatment options.

Even when they are busy, Laguna Creek Vet Hospital staff acknowledges me and helps me as soon as they can. I came 5 minutes to closing time to get more heartworm medicine, and they were kind, prompt, but didn't make me feel rushed. And when the vet is treating my dog, she looks my dog in the eye and gives her 100 percent of her attention, which is so rare these days. They are awesome and I have NO complaints.< /Text>

<Text>Honest, afffordable, caring environment. I had to say goodbye to my best friend Harley. There was no 'up care' since it was clear his prognosis was terminal and I'd never want to prolong his suffering. I wasn't pressured to go to extremes that were futile. I was given all of the information I needed to make a very, very difficult but informed decision. The vet tech Lottie even kissed my baby goodbye.< /Text><date>1503015935347< /date><name>L Smith</name></record>

We have been bringing several generations of our cats here for many years, and the practice has helped us keep them with us well and happy well into their teens.  I once called Dr. Purewal the "Cat Whisperer."  You should see him butt heads with a cat and get it purring!  And Doctors Van Doren and Layton are living up to his fine example.  Lottie and all the other staff are wonderful too.  We have faith in Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital that we are getting the best possible care for our little family members.< /review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><review>While the staff was friendly and involved, and the facility itself was clean and well kept, I had a bad experience overall.  (Note: this was my first experience with this veterinarian.)

I scheduled my cat for a check-up when I noticed he started spinning in one direction instead of standing still or walking straight.  After talking with the doctor she took him in the back to do some tests in order to determine what the issue was.  Outward, there was nothing wrong with my cat. So they gave him some anti-nausea medicine and told me to keep an eye on him.

That same day I had to rush him to an emergency vet when he started having seizures.  Less than 4 days later I had to put him down.

While this vet wasn't equipped to handle brain/emergency cases, it wasn't until later I realized that the first minor focal seizure actually happened AT THIS VET while she was talking to me about what they found, or rather, didn't find and she didn't recognize it as such.  I know in my head that even if they were to have caught it right then and we wouldn't have delayed those 5-6 hours it wouldn't have made a difference.

Unfortunately, this left a bad impression on me and I'm finding it hard to go back to them.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< userid>

I was blessed when I was lead by God to follow through with the appointment with Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital, for even when I realized I would be late then called to cancel they said to still come.  Toby my cat had bites with an abscess he was no mood to have anyone mess with him, but the veterinarian and assistants did their job well for he is now recovering with no side affects.<//text>

<date>1493345790871< /date><rate>5</rate><review>I absolutely love Laguna Creek Veterinary Hospital.
They don't lie and tell you that you need to do numerous amounts of things to help your pets. They are truthful and honest and that is the best quality to have, as so many vet hospitals will charge you crazy amounts for different services and push endless amounts of services, therapies, medications and/or surgeries. I just took my pup in to get looked at for excessive licking of his paws with flesh increased amounts of redness, irritation, and rash. I had the doc visit, got him tested for heart worm, got two medications and heart guard for 6 months and only paid $150. I was stunned!! At my previous vet near my old house that would have been a $300-$350 visit. I would recommend them to anyone and everyone!!
Thank you for loving and taking care of my loved ones!!<//review>< pics>

< review>
My husband and I started bringing our pets to Dr. Purewal in 2004 after a neighbor recommended him, and are beyond satisfied with the caring service that he and his staff provide. Our dogs are now 10+ years old and in excellent health, thanks to the routine checkups and vaccinations, emergency and dental care, understanding and advice of this excellent vet. I unreservedly recommend Dr. Jug Purewal, Dr. Van Doren, Lottie, and the rest of the top-quality staff and Laguna Creek Vet.< /review>

<user_name>Internal Screams< /user_name><time>1473538218981< /time><rating>1<//rating><Review>I have been taking my Maxx to Laguna Creek vet for two years now and the customer service and help from the staff is still superb! I've had a few emergencies (allergic reactions) and I was able to get in quickly and with a quick shot Maxx was back to normal. It is also really nice that the staff remembers you and your furbaby.

9/10/16 update - it seems after I posted my positive review Laguna Creek Vet decided to change their good service. On a recent occasion I had to prove to the office that I actually paid for a service because someone in their office did not update my account properly. I had to take time out of my day to try to find a receipt and my credit card charge from almost two months previous.  And not two weeks later, the same thing has happened from my most recent visit. I've decided to find another vet for Maxx.<//Review>< Pics>

The staff is wonderful, the Dr. on the other hand is a douche. If you enjoy being talked down too as if you were STUPID, then I would recommend you going here. He has down this on both occasions. Now you all might think I asked something stupid or had it coming, well your wrong. I work at a place that sells pet products and I know a thing or two about what kind of medicine is good or bad, what kind of flea medication is the best and so on. Oh yes and I also know what a SENSIBLE HARNESS is...because my dog has one and the clip goes on the front of the dogs chest. My dog is generally happy, she rarely growls at people, she's a huge people lover, but she didnt like this Dr. She must not like DOUCHE BAGS that much. During the visit, the Dr. asks if my dog is on any medications, I of course pull the bag of her meds. out and he's going through them, he starts asking " do you know what this is for?" so on and so fourth, I say "yes" then he gets to her heart-worm medicine, he says "do you know what this is for?" again my response is "yes" then I explain its for heart-worm, he then asks if I know what heart-worm is...I say yes, I know the just of it, then he asks me "is this your dog?" WTF kind of question is that, I am sure I would have made it abundantly clear if it wasn't my dog. he asked that from just me answering "i know the just of it" oh yea cause everyone goes around cutting dogs open and looking at their heart for heart-worms. Are you serious? then he points to my dogs flea medicine and asks if i know what that is for....REALLY? come on...I Obviously bought it, I know what the eff it is and what it is used for. Then he takes my dog, looks at her "sensible harness" and says "you have this on wrong" I replied "no I dont, its on right. its a sensible harness, it clips in the front of the chest not on the back so if the dog...." then he cuts me off and says "I have never seen one of these" but he said it in a tone that made it seem like I was lying about it, which to me is funny since, I again bought this and know how it works.
I was reading some of the other reviews on here, and I find it funny that one says "vets are extremely friendly and real animal lovers" cause in this case that is false. This (India) Indian guy seems like he doesn't like or cant handle medium sized dogs very well, and he also doesn't know how to approach them either. His def. need to learn a thing or two about talking to people and how to approach animals. I will be looking for a new Vet ASAP!!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response></record>

My husband just bought me a bottle ofCarolans Irish Cream tonight and brought it home to me as a surprise. He went to pour me  a shot and it came out like sludge. He then took it back 20 minutes later and they refused to refund him.<//Review>

I've been an everyday customer for almost two years now. Very disappointed in closing staff. I pulled up on sat. It says on the doorthey close at midnight it was 1145 and they saw me drive up and still locked the door and turned off the lights. I'm going back tohillcrest even though it's all the way across town.im not going back to Dave's liquor!!!<//review>

< Review>
I have a new haircut place to go to from here on out. I will say that the staff are very friendly but in a genuine way not the fake/forced way. It's great because you sit in the chair to get your haircut while you are able to talk to your barber.

The service is outstanding. On my first visit I was given a shampoo treatment and a back massage, with a machine no hands on, which I was a bit apprehensive of at first. When I finally relaxed it was nice to get a great level of treatment that I had never gotten for myself. Plus the cut I got was really well done, my barber asked questions and did exactly what I wanted which is great.

I highly recommend coming here for a haircut.< /Review>

Great place. Cool atmosphere. Awesome people. I really love the work they do here. They got a great team and never let me down. I constantly get my hair colored here and always love the outcome. If you're looking for a great colorist, ask for Ricky. He's really amazing and knows how to get the color you want right.  Overall, wonderful place, would highly recommend. :)< /Review>

Funny enough, I am a girl who came in wanting a short haircut. Crystal helped me, and she was so amazing and helpful. I've had a bunch of previous hair stylists try to talk me out of short hair, but Crystal was so helpful and kind. She took so much time and care with my hair and I love how it turned out.<//Text>

<text>Check in/check out easy. Services offered are very good. Haircut did not match the rest of the experience as it wasn't very good. Rushed through it, lots of stray clumps that weren't cut, sides (which were #2) had thicker patches in it because it was rushed, she asked how I liked my corners in the back and I said rounded, she cut them square, didn't trim my neck down to my shirt line. It's a shame because the rest of the experience was pretty neat. I may give it another try but will definitely avoid the first person who cut my hair.< /text><gmapID>0x80e82ff24c6434fd:0x79ee0d7629add28a<//gmapID><user_name>Kris Karsten< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I walked in with no appointment on a Saturday morning expecting a 20 minute wait. There were several workers and each worked very efficiently and courteously with their clients.  I only had to wait perhaps 4 minutes before it was my turn for a cut.  Friendly conversation during the process made the time pass quickly.  Great service and great results.< /Review>

Probably some of the rudest “stylists” I’ve ever met. They didn’t listen to me when I said my son wanted a Mohawk. And I over heard a “stylist”say that “people” need to hurry up. Never coming back here again.< /Review>

<text>Your stylist always do a good job. We were greeted promptly and enthusiastically. It was a little off putting that 2 of your stylists choose to have what should have been that private conversation in the lobby area 7 feet from me and my 2 grandsons.

Overall it want a bad conversation, but definitely one that should have taken place in the back room or at the adjacent Starbucks. They were loud and animated about someone that had suggested different merchandising ideas which they thought were not to their liking and then proceeded to disrespect other persons associated with the business. Going in to discuss tipping and favors for their clients.

Again overall it wasn’t a bad conversation, it was simply one that should have taken place outside the earshot of customers and especially children.

Hope this helps.</text></record>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>Took my son to this location for the first time to receive a new hair cut. Asked for the sides of his hair to be faded.  Finished cut was uneven and not faded at all. It was basically the same 0 bus cut all the way to the top where I didn’t have her cut. I asked for one correction to blend one side with the other, but the cut was so bad and disappointing that I left with the intention of going somewhere else to fix it. Even haircuts if other people I saw leaving were not very good.  I will never go back to the TO location again. Agoura location is much much better in my opinion.  Gave 2 stars because the staff was nice and shop was charming, but just not very good.</Text>< Resp>

Brazil is my all time favorite hair stylist. She is my go-to whenever I need a haircut, I will only go on days that she works, and will happily wait the hour long wait for her. It is always worth it and I always get an excellent experience every step of the process. I always with a great haircut and looking forward to coming back in.</review>

Went there for a fade the lady didn’t seem that confident but she said ok so I figured she knew how (half my fault I guess). literally the worst fade I ever got, had to go spend another 30$ at a different barbershop. When I walked in they asked me if I had tried to give myself a haircut because of quarantine...<//review>

<Review>Brazil made my sons hair look amazing!! After taking him somewhere else where they completely butchered it I had to look quickly for someone to fix it! Brazil was that someone. I will definitely be coming back. Because if she can fix my sons hair after it was horribly done, I can’t imagine what she could do with a clean slate. Thank you!!<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
First time going to this Sport Clips on Arboles in T.O. Maybe I was unlucky but I got home and combed my hair down in front of my forehead to find sections are 1.5 inches uneven in a few places! She said she was still new but dang...It looks like a chain saw hit my bangs and if I cut more to fix it I wont have the length to be able to slick back my hair. I am not that picky about haircuts but I felt compelled to post this review. Service was also very slow.<//Review>

< Review>
Had a haircut done by Kris it is seriously the best haircut I have ever had.  I've never had someone actually cut my hair and make it have volume.  My hair is so fine people usually leave lines in iti cut it shorter then i asked.  I pretty much have up over the years and just told the barber to cut it however.  I said that to Kris and she just looked at my hair and was so nice and professional.  It is always nice to see someone love what they do and do a great job at it.  The entire experience left me with so much gratitude.  The whole staff was great and I definitely recommend going here.< /Review>

Cortney is amazing. She is extremely talented, courteous and hard working. I can’t imagine going to any other location unless she is moved to another location as a manager!

Old review:
Brazil was amazing. So very kind. All the staff were great. No I’m not a secret shopper. Just a guy trying to help others around the nation for the character by integrity act. I highly recommend this sports clips location. Great cut and the MVP was needed and felt great. Thank you Brazil !!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I do like that they store your hair cut style you like, I never have to explain it. All the stylists I've had have been good, so that's a bonus as well but I'm also not super picky.

Only down side is that it is a little pricey for a regular haircut.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Carleen was excellent. She really took her time to make sure my haircut was sharp. She and Brazil were both very patient with my 4 year old who decided to be difficult and not get his hair cut after all. The VIP treatment was really nice after a long day at work. I’ve definitely found the place I’ll be going back to for the foreseeable future<//Review>< user>

<review>$28 down the drain.

Shabi is the one who cut my hair so I can't vouch for the others.

I asked for a simple 2 on the sides, 2 on the back, and half inch off the top.

What I got was an inch and a half off the top and an uneven, rough buzz for the sides and back. Doesn't bode well when a simple undercut is something you can mess up. Might as well take the $28 and drive elsewhere.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80e82ff24c6434fd:0x79ee0d7629add28a</GmapID></record>

Located in the same plaza as the DMV and Round Table Pizza. It's pretty nice to watch sports while your hair gets taken care of. I got the MVP package that includes a head massage, shampoo and conditioner, and a chair that gives a decent body massage. Prices are great for the amount of pampering you receive. I'm now a regular! FYI, Courtney was my stylist. Thanks Courtney!</text>

It's always a great experience here. I come here every 6-8 weeks to have my hair cut and they always know what to do. I even get new suggestions occasionally and they remember who I am and actually seem to care. The MVP is sometimes rushed but it's still worth it.< /text>

Carleen was our stylist amd she did am amazing job with my son. My son is autistic and was starting to have a hard time with getting his haircut. She made him feel very comfortable .

Went in to get a free MVP haircut and it was the best experience I've had while getting my haircut. From plasma TVs with all the sports to watch.  to massage chairs with hot towels to relax. This place has it all. Courtney did an exceptional job on my haircut, as I only showed her a picture of the style, and bam I have the same exact style now. 10/10 will be coming back!
Check it out if you haven't yet!! Sportsclips is the only place I will be going from now on.</review>

it was not what I was expecting it to be. for 28 bucks you get the cut, (which they work meticulously on) then the wash, (in a massage chair by the way) with a hot towel on your face while they wash and massage your scalp, and then at the end you get another quick shoulder massage to finish things off. I normally pay much more for a cut and wash and I have to say this was possibly the best cut I've had in a long time, both with the result and the experience.< /review>

Cortney is the one who cut mine, and my sons hair. She did So amazing! Not just with my Sons & my hair, but also in the way she interacted with him. He's so shy, but she made him feel so comfortable❤ I'll definitely always come back to her!< /text>

Just got a haircut (not to mention a nice wash, head massage, hot towel complimentary for coming there my first time), and I can say... Very, very impressed. Yoselin did an amazing job, was friendly, and treated me well. I told her about my travels to Canada to see my girlfriend for Valentine's day, and she did a great job! Best haircut experience I've had to date! Would do 6 stars if I could!</Review>

Kris is the best.  I've tried 3 different people to cut my hair, and had left a poor review before due to what turned out to be a misunderstanding on my part.

No one at this location, young or old, does as thorough of a job as Kris.  She moves fast, which worried me that we were sacrificing quality for quantity—but that simply wasn't the case!

Thank you!< /Review>

The friendliness of the staff and how thoughtful they are of each individual.  My son has a disability and his stylist always remembers his name and is so ggod with him.  He loves going to get his hair cut.  Any small child would love going there especially if they love sports as my son does.</text>

A great place that has a lot of talent in the staff. Yoselin has been cutting my hair for a year now and I wouldn’t use another person. Their isn’t a long wait and a nice tv to watch if there is a wait..good atmosphere. Great products on the shelves<//Review>

I absolutely love Sports Clips. And my stylist Yoseline is the best I have ever had.

I love that they have sports on TV, the hot towel treatment and just the whole experience makes it so worth while. I look forward to getting my haircut now every month. I walk away feeling like a new man.

If you're a man and haven't tried Sports Clips yet you're missing out. I have recommended to everyone I know.< /Text>

<Review>I used to go to the Westlake Sport Clips and had a stylist I liked. She left and I tried the Thousand Oaks location. I had to repeatedly tell the stylist to modify what she was doing. During the MVP portion of the cut, the towel was scalding hot and the stylist literally grabbed my cheeks so hard the are still sore this morning. I may have a bruise on my face from the “massage.”  I guess I need to find a barber.<//Review>< pics>

Shabi gave me the best haircut I’ve had in a long long time. Very sweet lady that is working her tail off to give her daughter a better life here in the US. I recommend her to ANYONE!</text>

Our daughter participates and performs in Winter Guard. She's always excited about going to Subway and getting a couple footlongs, which she calls a jam packed salad in a sandwich. ...always makes a difference in her day< /Text>

<review>If I could give this place no stars I will. This staff needs customer service training really really bad. I went during the lunch rush, as a customer the staff made me really feel like a burden on them for coming there and ordering food in a specified way. They made it a point to let me feel their frustration. One employee asked me what I wanted on my sub, as I was talking she walked away without a word and started doing other tasks. It was rude and unacceptable. I won't be returning to this store. They need to improve on their professionalism drastically. My advice if you go here, go when it's slow. You may actually get treated with basic human decency.< /review>< pictures>

Terrible customer service.  They started my order and when it comes time to pay they say it's cash only?  Nowhere else did it state this, nor was I told beforehand.
They left everyone in the store waiting for 15 minutes while one worker is on the phone, and two not doing anything.
The cashier, Cher or something, her name tag was smudged, was not even willing to rectify the situation at all.  Will definitely be calling corporate Subway about this.<//text>

That was dinner for me and my kids everything was good until I say please go easy on the ranch and the girl just put all bunch of ranch on the salad. This is a job that they need to hear what the customer is asking you know.<//Review>

No greeting whatsoever when we arrived or waited to be served at the counter (we were the only ones standing in line); the woman with the blue polo simply looked at us. Since when is OJ considered a carbonated drink (see receipt pictures)? SMH.</text>

with my gift card!

My experience with this Subway has brought a smile to my face.  The lines did not exist until after my order.  So no wait time for my meal!

It does get busy so I recommend a bit of patience.

Thanks be to God for you and your family!

Our Lady of Guadalupe, help!

I love this subway it's right by my house. It's family friendly. The food always look fresh. But I recommend going during the day a not so close to closing hours where there is only one to two workers and they don't move very fast having to make the sandwich and check it out they repeat but you can't complain cause after making the sandwich and checking out the wash their hands the go through the process again.< /text>

I worked here for about 5 to 6 months. As an EX employee, this place is a failure... The management was not well maintained, all they do here is accuse you of stealing and giving away food. I worked here full time 6 days a week. July was a month where subway was breaking a law , they were selling people food that sat at room temperature for at least 5 days. I have pictures to prove it. Our refrigerator walk in AC (where we store all of the food from vegetables, chicken and beef and pork ) was broken and wasn't keeping the food at a safe temperature. Our manager PATTY let us continue with serving people rotten food. Chicken noodle soup that had bubbles around the rim of the bowl was still being served to elders, children and everyone. I advise you all stay away from this greedy company. Or at least this location. They also have roaches, I've killed a few big ones and spotted a few baby ones in the lobby. I quit today because I worked too hard for this store for them to accuse me of stealing and threatened to call the cops on me for "stealing". We were short staffed for the whole time I worked there. My boyfriend and I worked there together for those months and he is also a witness during the time that the refrigerator was busted. He and I were basically forced to serve people bacteria grown chicken, pork and beef. I hope they learn to appreciate their GOOD workers if they ever get any again.</text>

I'm a big fan of subway, BUT... I dont recommend coming to this location at night because there is only one or two employee  working and you end up waiting like 20+ minutes for a sandwich just to get attitude..the  heavyset girl "MANUELA" was very rude. Dont work at subway if you hate your job. They also usually run out of the jalapeno cheddar bread, management needs to step it up to make sure they always have the breads they advertise.< /text>

Making a hungry customer wait because you want to make yourself and another employee sandwhiches is not good customer serivice. Hire people who care not two 20 year old stoners with piercings, pathetic not worth going to this store front.< /Review>

Eat here if you want to be ripped off on meat portions. Subway Corp has them use a scoop to measure and this location doesn’t fill the scoop. Even when asked why they don’t fill it appropriately they just said, that’s all that we give. Such a bad example for the franchise.< /text>

Love subway!!!  The experience here was horrible . Been here more than three times but these two times I experienced horrible experience from the same girl ..  I like certain things on my sandwhich like the two diff kinds of cheese in a pattern or pepper on my chicken!?! And this girl whos attended me Maunela to be specific has both times alway puts a pouty b***** face and acts rude after I tell her To put or do certain things on my sandwhich?!? I pay for my sandwhich and for your service. Its not a choice to be upset, your job is making sandwhiches for people the way they like them ... Not to mention they try and talk smack infront of your face and in spanish as if you cant hear or understand what they're saying? Also she kept starring me down during check out time? If i had a choice to put no stars I would . And Manuela I hope your manager reads this .<//Text>

I wish we (still) had lesbian bars like this, in Portland! 💋👩‍❤️‍👩🍸
Good drink specials,  delicious made to order food, a little on the spendy side for bar grub, but that might just be my lack of comfort with San Francisco pricing 🤣.  I loved the wall of pictures in the back room dance floor (wink) and the wallpaper is really delightful... you'll just have to visit to know what I'm talking about!
Relaxed, fun atmosphere.. even on an early Friday night it was still busy enough to feel anonymous if that's your thing, but enough room to move and dance. I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in town.</text>

<Review>This was my first time being able to celebrate Pride (and in San Francisco no less!). Jolene’s was full of wonderful LGBT folks from all over the Bay Area the night after the parade- but we know the real Pride starts when we can all share the same intimate space. The music and atmosphere was static.

Jolene’s is a place where you can revel in the joy, the resilience, the protest, and the camaraderie that the San Francisco lgbt+ community has to offer.< /Review>< Pics>

Shereen and Shannan were absolutely amazing! Hands down best service thus far. Promptness with a smile is all you can ask for when you are getting bottomless mimosas! Will be back most definitely.<//Review>

10$ dollar entrance fee regardless of what event is going on. Takes forever to get served at the bar. The drinks are expensive and come in really small plastic cups that are filled with ice. The dance floor has no ventilation and feels like you are in a sweat steam room. The music always leaves something to be desired. In addition, the vibe is always very strange and hostile. I have been several times and I regret ever spending any time or money there.< /text>

Relaxed and welcoming atmosphere for any and all. Usually get some Mac and cheese balls and fries to go along with rotating, inventive cocktails. Awesome dance floor which is usually empty when I go on weekday evenings. Good for you and a partner, a solo work session, or a medium-sized group (plenty of season).<//text>

<Review>Not a safe place. Not inclusive. Was hoping for a good lgbt community and female power but was disappointed when I felt out of place, ignored when being served, and rude management. Would not go here again.<//Review>< Name>

The vibe on a Friday night is fun.  Food is surprisingly yummy, but prices for food & drink tend on the higher end.  Go-go dancers, good DJ jams, good lighting, pool table, and a safe & fun atmosphere lead to good times.  I have not experienced brunch, but I have yet to have a negative experience here.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>This new bar is so well thought out! They have water pitchers (so You don’t have to ask at the bar and can stay hydrated), plenty of seating in the spacious main room, gogo dancers, great bar food, pool tables, coat check and an intimate room for dancing within eyeshot of the DJ. Such a good club! Honestly, think it’s the best new gay bar in the city!</review>< Pics>

<review>Not really my scene but the music was fun, definitely not mainstream. The dancefloors are pretty small, so it gets very hot. The food was definitely a plus!< /review>< pictures>

The space needs lots of ventilation although they were no crowd at all but it was really really hot in there and we couldn't handle it so we had to leave.
The music is good though.<//Review>

Jolene Linsangan is a notorious TERF and this bar by extension is a haven for TERF's! Do not patron! There are FAR better alternatives for the lesbian community.

Transgender women, especially ones of color, are NOT welcome, at best they are tolerated. Should they "step out line" by having the temerity to approach a CIS woman they are instantly expelled!<//text>

< Review>
Sunday was my friends Birthday. She had called and messaged ahead of time to see how to reserve tables for all in her party. There was a planned 30 ppl from south bay suppose to show up to celebrate. She was told its 1st come 1st serve basis. So we showed up right when doors opened walked in and saw 3 tables with "reserved" signs on  them. We asked the bartender how we could get tables or even reserve them. We told her what we were told. Her reply is "I literally have no idea. That comes from the owner".  We thought that was weird but settled for bar sitting even though we knew it wasn't going to be enough space for us all. As time went on now 3hrs into the show  I wanted to try some of my friends mimosa. So I poured 2 oz in my 4 oz water cup. With quickness the male bartender jumped down my throat. Going off on me about how I didn't pay for the mimosa. And I told him no my friend did I just wanted to try it. He continued to tell me I couldn't bc I didn't pay for it. I said so is "sharing is not caring here" he said "No sharing is not caring here" he told me that I might as well drink it now being that I poured it. I told him nm he turned me off to it and I didn't want it anymore. From that point on I didn't order anything anymore.

Look ppl I get if it's their policy you can't share bottomless mimosas but don't talk ppl so rudely. Especially if you do not have that posted anywhere not even on your website! Seriously there are different ways to tell a customer what the bar policy is. In all none of us in the party were impressed or really happy about the service here. We will not be back. That's 22 ppl from SJ who will only be speaking about how bad their experience was here.</Review>

<text>I can’t even begin to start. From the moment I set foot in the office I felt like royalty every staff member was amazing. They were so focused on making me comfortable and safe while in their care. The attention and kindness Dr Kim provided me was immaculate. He is fun, gentle, generous and efficient. He is the most trauma informed dental professional I have been to. I seriously thought I was at a spa, being wrapped in a warm blanket while the tech lathered my lips with organic lip balm after my procedure. There’s a part of me that wants another tooth extraction solely to be cared for as I was at his office. Thank you again for all you’ve done this far, I’m excited for my return visit.

<gmapID>0x808fb6dc310c18c3:0x27fba1700dda540d</gmapID><Text>Dr. Kim is quite gentle and professional. I had my four wisdom teeth extracted in Dr. Kim’s office. Because I would like to take a Uber home, I did local anesthesia but I did not feel any pain during the surgery. Dr. Kim explained to me each procedure, calmed me down and told me to relax my shoulders and take deep breath. I would also thank Carlos, who walked me through the whole consultation before the surgery and assisted Dr. Kim during my surgery. And of course , Emily, who played my favorite musician Charlie Puth’s  songs during my surgery and elaborated post-operative instructions to me. Thank you all for your patience and wonderful job! I will refer my friends to see Dr. Kim when someone needs an oral surgery.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Was wowed by the excellent service provided.
Super friendly and polite staff and very clean and tidy office.

Extraction of teeth is not the most pleasant operation but the staff was very attentive and caring. Everything happened quickly and painlessly. I am very glad that my experience in tooth extraction took place in this dentistry.
Thank you to the amazing staff!
I highly recommend Dr. Joseph Kim to all!</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808fb6dc310c18c3:0x27fba1700dda540d</Gmap_id></record>

The entire staff of Dr. Joseph Kim is extremely kind, always smiling and wanting to ensure that the patient is comfortable.

I had gone to get my 4 wisdom teeth / molars extracted and the entire process was so smooth. Kate was my nurse and she ensured that I was not nervous, felt comfortable and she was their with me from the beginning to the end. She even got me a nice warm blanket to keep me cozy before the procedure started and at the end when I was sort of sedated she put me on a wheel chair and dropped me to my car.
The entire experience was exceptional and exceeded all my expectations.

Dr. Joesph Kim was so calm and helped me relax too. He is a great oral surgeon, before I knew the procedure was complete and I was given proper instructions for the upcoming week to maintain oral hygiene or take any pain killers.
Dr. Joseph even gave us his personal cell number to reach him incase we had any discomfort and wanted to get a hold of him during off hours.

I would rate this place an 11/10. They are so so good.

Thank you to everyone from Caroline and the other girl (forgot your name, I am so sorry) at front desk to Kate, Carlos and Dr. Joseph,  you all are the best I have seen in 32 years. I appreciate all your kindness towards me.<//review>

<text>As a dental hygienist I am very selective about where my family and I receive our dental care. Dr. Kim and staff have high standards and have exceeded my expectations every time. Both my sons have had smooth third molar extractions by Dr Kim with minimal recovery time. I also have  had an implant placed with no complications. When a patient needs to be referred out to an oral surgeon his office is the first one I recommend. His precision and focus on detail are attributes that make me feel confident in his abilities. His vast knowledge of general health and skills make him one of the top oral surgeons in Northern California.</text>< Pics>

<review>Dr. Kim was quick and efficient in removing 3 of my wisdom teeth. He talked me through the process as I was under only local anesthesia by choice. Reminding me to breathe and relax my shoulders was very helpful and I would recommend everyone to use local if they don’t mind just pressure no pain and you get to experience the procedure!!</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Dr. Kim offers an exceptionally professional and caring experience. For nearly a decade, we have trusted him for our whole family’s care - from wisdom teeth removal to implants. We have always been extremely pleased. Love his wholistic approach to health too. It’s not just about teeth for him, it’s about total health. Great, friendly staff. Welcoming, state-of-the art office. Thank you!</text></record></dataset><record>

I have known Dr. Kim for past 20 years and I must admit that I am honored to use his facility for several wisdom tooth extractions in our family. He is clearly extremely skillful in his dentistry work. More importantly, he is always welcoming, Cheerful and treats patients with respect. His team & Staff are best. No doubt this is the best place in whole of Bay area to take care of all your Maxillofacial Surgery needs. Kudos! to Dr. Kim and his Staff. Five Stars!<//Review>

Dr. Kim and his staff are great! My son had his wisdom teeth extracted on NYE and had some concerns that night so I called the after hours number. Dr. Kim himself answered and appeased our concerns (thank you!). His staff also called to check how he was doing. A very caring team!</text>

I had three wisdom teeth removed and honestly it was the most enjoyable visit to the dentist :P They gave me thorough post-operative instructions and reminded me that I can reach the doctor even outside of business hours if I have any problem, so I feel confident that I will heal without any issues. Thanks again, Dr. Kim!<//Review></record>

Dr. Kim and his staff are very knowledgable and so caring. Getting wisdom teeth removed is nothing fun, but they made me feel really comfortable about the procedure. They explained everything to me clearly and made sure I understood the risks. I'm so happy I chose this office because Dr. Kim and everyone in the office truly care about their patients.< /review>

Doctor Kim and the staff have a great attention to details and I had a very positive experience from the first interaction till I walked out the clinic. Simply put, I felt the service was worth the price (which says way more than you'd think considering the bay area price craziness). Informative, helpful, service-oriented and prompt without being pushy.<//text></record></dataset><record>

WOULD RECOMMEND DR. KIM TO EVERYONE!!!
My daughter had the best experience with having 4 wisdom teeth pulled! She was nervous about the procedure as people were telling her prior to the appt., how horrible that experience can be. She is also afraid of needles, so that added to the anxiousness.

The office is such a welcoming, tranquil, and comfortable environment that it sets the tone of calmness when you first arrive. Then the assistance are friendly and informative with prepping you for the procedure. One of the assistance massaged my daughter’s head to calm and deflect her concentration as they gave her the shot of anesthetic. Afterward, she commented on how appreciative she was that they took her anxiety away from the needle as she fell asleep.

My husband said the office was so comfortable for waiting; what seemed like three YouTube videos later, she was already done! They sent her home with a (silly looking but so necessary) chin band that held ice packets to her cheeks. She listened to their exact direction for keeping the ice band on, rinsing the areas with a plastic syringe they supplied, rested the first day, and took the prescribed medication as needed.

The first day she limited herself to jello and porridge, by the second day her cheeks were no longer swollen (off with the ice band) and she started back on soft foods.  Today is the third day and she looks and feels totally normal. But she will be cautious with eating softer food so she doesn’t trigger any set backs with her improvements.

Thank you Dr. Kim and your team! You have made this procedure one we will share with everyone (and a surprisingly positive one) that will contradict most other people’s past experiences.<//text>

<Text>Compared to other dentist places this one had was very little wait time, and the ambiance goes above and beyond. Instead of doing the regular check-ups they get to know you and offer drinks( water, coffee, juice) in fancy glass cups. They also like to make sure your know the risk and responsibilities of each procedure, taking the time to clarify each step. Also everyone here is so down to earth, and really care about there clients. Would definitely recommend!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><date>1544116031418</date><Rating>5</Rating>< GmapID>

Dr. Kim and his team are the best! I would highly highly recommend Dr. Kim, and I don't see myself wanting to go to any other oral surgeon. I got my wisdom removed and my entire experience was spectacular-- from the consultation, to the procedure, to post operative recommendations. Their practice got me feeling They even called me the following day to check up on me. His team was polite, helpful, friendly, and understanding. Dr. Kim is such a cool guy and he was able to make me feel so comfortable I wasn't nervous at all. I partially wish I had more wisdom teeth to remove so I could come back!</review>

Best medical experience of my life, no question about it.

I’ll preface this by saying I avoided getting my wisdoms out for years. I was terrified by the idea of anesthesia and losing control of my body, worried I would be in severe pain, and overall anxious to the point of nightmares over this procedure. If you’re highly sensitive and you need your teeth removed, keep reading: this review is for you.
With zero exaggeration I can say that every member of Dr. Kim’s team is incredible at helping patients feel at ease and taken care of. Dr. Kim himself is stellar. He has a sense of humor, he’s got interpersonal skills at a level that I find rare, and he’s got a steady hand.
The process on surgery day was easy and even the process of receiving anesthesia was virtually painless. Dr. Kim told me to “go to a nice beach in my mind” and that he’d be giving me “three glasses of wine.” I don’t even remember falling asleep, but next minute I had my eyes open to Julie saying “you’re all done! You did great!” I was shocked. The worst part after that was just the taste of the topical medication, which I masked with coffee ice cream :) I didn’t even take my prescribed medicine, I just took a lot of ibuprofen to control the minimal pain.
8 days after my surgery day, I’m able to eat normally again. I had my checkup appointment and everything is healing wonderfully. I put my full trust into Dr. Joseph Kim and his superb team. If you’ve got a referral for this practice, I urge you to go through with it. I feel so much gratitude for having met these medical professionals who totally reframed my idea and expectation of a procedure. I think I will be much less fearful in the future because of how positive this experience was. It even costed less than I expected (I have delta dental PPO). Lavina, Diana, Marcella, Dr. Kim, and everyone else who contributed to my experience: thank you thank you thank you.</text>

Just survived a surgery I was scared to death. Dr. Kim is amazing. He and his team have been cheering me up the whole process. Like all previous procedures contacted by Dr. Kim, this one went smoothly. I'm so grateful for being his patient and for all outstanding work he's done for me for all these years. Highly recommend Dr. Kim to anyone who is looking for oral surgeon that can be trusted without any tiny little doubt.< /Text>

I had all four wisdom teeth removed very recently and my sister suggested we’d go to Dr. Kim saying he’s the best in the Bay Area. In all honesty, I say he’s the best in the whole wide world! I’m not gonna elaborate on it further, I highly recommend you go find out yourself!
Have a good one.</review>

< Review>
My son got all his wisdom teeth extracted right before the new year. I was so scared before the surgery since it was his first time going through a general anesthesia. Both the surgery and recovery were extremely smooth with little bleeding. Both Dr. Kim and the staffs were friendly and helpful before and after the surgery. I was really grateful that Dr. Kim got referred to us by the general dentists at Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry. I would highly recommend Dr. Kim to anyone.< /Review>

Wisdom teeth removal with Dr. Kim was fast, uncomplicated, and very little bleeding after surgery. After lots of drinking water, ice on cheeks, and rest, barely any swelling and recovered quickly.  Staff was very nice and would recommend to anyone in need of removing their wisdom teeth. :)</review>

Had my upper wisdom teeth removed here. Dr Kim was great. Super fast and didn't feel anything but the sedation shots at the start. I was very positively surprised with the experience, especially because I had had a bad experience with my lower wisdom teeth a couple of years earlier (with a different doctor). Staff are very friendly and helpful as well.< /text>

<text>At first he seemed like he would be great.  However, when we went to show up for our daughters surgery appointment and the "copay" was almost more than half of what they told us would be our cost. Original patient estimate was $568.  When we came in (at 6am!) they said we owed almost $900.  When I said that I had an issue with that the doctor came out in a very loud tone saying he didn't appreciate me coming in and not keeping my end of the "bargain".  I told him that it was their responsibility to contact me before the surgery to let me know of the increase in cost.  He told me it was my responsibility to contact the insurance.  Never have I had to do that nor have I ever experienced given a patient estimate that goes up more than 70%! Then he proceeded to tell us that the reason he charges more is so that "if" the insurance doesn't charge as much he can give us a refund so "everyone is happy".  This was all being communicated through yelling at us.  Wouldn't even let my husband speak.  He kept repeating to me how he didn't appreciate what I did and how he had to pay his staff an extra hour because of me. As a service provider my expectation is not to be scolded for a mistake that his staff made and not communicating but rather to care for the patient, our daughter. Then he said lets just do the surgery at the original copay amount and that he wouldn't be responsible if the insurance contacted me later with a bill. There was no way in the WORLD I would have let him touch my daughter after all of that.  An all the while our daughter is sitting there listening to him yell at her parents which really upset her. He honestly showed himself as shady and not trust worthy.  I am going to report him to my insurance company.  I felt really bad for the front desk lady whom seemed to be very concerned for us and worried about the after math.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Dr Kim is a very positive and energetic doctor with good sense of humor.  We had a tight schedule, his team managed to squeeze Sandy's surgery appointment to a very early appointment within two days.  He helped to remove 4 wisdom teeth for my daughter. The whole process is very smooth and fast. Everything was explained very clearly to us about the surgery, and what need to be done before and after.< /Review>< pictures>

Dr. Kim is a fantastic dentist I was having a tooth extracted on one side of my mouth when he looked at the x-ray he saw something on the other side of my mouth  that he want to take a closer look at it turned out to be a large tumor  growing around my back molar  and up into my sinuses .if it were not for Dr. Kim’s knowledge and compassion for his patients I don’t know  if and when I would have discovered it  Dr Kim also work with my health insurance carrier to make sure I would get proper treatment. He went above and beyond I could not ask for better care< /Text>

Dr. Kim and all of the staff at his practice were exceptional. The care that they took throughout the process, with a follow-up call and even flowers delivered to my home the next day! I highly recommend Doctor Kim<//Text>

<text>I was referred to Dr.Kim by my general dentist for tooth (fractured molar) extraction. I got same day appointment for consultation and after discussing with Dr. Kim, I decided to go with his recommendation of extraction and placing the implant at the same time. I got the extraction and implant done on the following day.  Dr. Kim and his staff are excellent. I am concerned about implants in general.  Dr. Kim and his staff are very patient and explained every question I had with respect to the procedure options and associated costs and why some of the procedures are needed. The front office staff and clinical staff are very professional and courteous. The procedure went well.  Dr. Kim explained the procedure and during the procedure (local anesthesia), he was explaining every step of the way.  Today is second day after the procedure. On the day of the procedure after the anesthesia wore out, I had slight pain, but that got subsided by late evening. Today no pain or soreness. Overall it is very positive experience. I will do another posting once the implant heals and a crown is placed as that is the actual result I am interested.< /text>< rating>

Dr. Joseph Kim and his staff were very knowledgeable and helpful.  The procedure went smoothly and my recovery process went exactly as explained by Dr. Kim and staff.
In addition, insurance paid more than what was estimated so his office sent me a check for the difference.< /review>

<Text>Horrible experience at this place. I arrived before the scheduled time but called in only after half an hour has passed the scheduled time. Someone who has no idea of how insurance works being sent to me to talk, and she later called someone else in to correct everything she has just said. In the end I was blamed for asking “too much” questions to clarify the inconsistencies due to their inefficient explanation. I’m sure the surgeon is decent, but no thanks to the staff.<//Text><Rate>1</Rate>< date>

<Text>Dr. Kim is fantastic. The Office Staff is all very professional as well. Their main concern along with your treatment is your comfort during the procedure.

He started talking to me in a condescending manner, he talked in slow motion and asked me about if I know what 'nerve' is...
He asked me if I know what 'nerve' is!

Pretty much in and out for DMV paperwork in spite of Covid protocols.  Reps were friendly and helpful.  I waited outside while my husband got paperwork completed and Rep brought paperwork to me to sign.</text>

<review>Cannot and won't do without AAA!  I've needed them for a slashed tire and a battery jump in the past year!  They have always responded promptly and given me the best service.  On my move across country, they helped in mapping out my stops and final destination.  Even though I have a cell phone, just in case there is no signal....AAA is a wonderful backup plan for directions.....and its included in Member Services! ALL females should have AAA!< /review>< Pics>

I have only gone here to do most of my DMV stuff like renewal. The best place to go instead of actually going to DMV and waist most of my day.</text>

Went to renew my registration. Today is the deadline. Sign outside says u can pay with cash, check or credit card. Personally, no longer use checks, but i know if you go online to most places, you can use ur routing # and account #.  Not possible with AAA. Oh well, had to leave, get cash and return. Came back and had to fill out paperwork that i did not have 2 on the prior visit not twenty minutes prior. Again, oh well. But would love 2 hear the same rules and implementations from any worker. Playing field should always be the same. Not 2 much to ask 4.< /text>

I had received a fix it ticket two months ago for not having a front license plate.  I sent a request into the dmv for plates right after receiving the ticket, but never heard/received a thing from them.  I walked into AAA, told them what I needed, and they helped me right away.  I walked out with new license plates withing 10 minutes or less.  Great, quick service with 0 complaints from me. Needless to say, my visit was a pleasure.<//text>

<text>I am a member of AAA Auto Club mainly to avoid going to the DMV, that being said today Saturday 8.22.20 was my first time in the AAA office off Clark and Spring in Long Beach and the service I was given was nothing short of spectacular! I recently purchased an old Sears Game Fisher 12' fiber glass boat and American Trailer I began with only one bill of sale and was told by seller there was no other paperwork ie: title for boat because it has no vin, no title for trailer because its registered for life. Sounded weird to me but what the heck paid 450.00 for both together. Turns out trailer and boat both had vins and now both have titles being mailed to my house and until then I have temporary copies to cover me. This all made possible in what had to be record time by a wonderful woman named Patty (I am 99% sure of her name, please AAA let me know if thats incorrect or I will return to check because she deserves to be recognized!) I arrived at 149pm 11 minutes before closing and rather than turn me away Patty volunteered to take care of my predicament, I was in and out by 215pm with boat registration and quagga mussel sticker in hand and that included a trip to quite possibly the slowest ATM in all the land! I brought what I thought was enough cash for everything however I was misinformed my first time trying to get this taken care of at a different location and needed 11.00 extra, so close. The whole time I was guided through the process, no joke line by line so nothing was missed. I was given the correct vin, manufactured date and everything else necessary; all with more professionalism, courtesy and smiles than and entire state of DMV employees it would seem! Truly grateful, thanks for being so knowledgeable, so great, and going so far above and beyond all of my expectations! I only hope when I return if you aren't the person I meet with they are half as good!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Name>Coco Ding</Name><review>AAA has implemented some COVID safety procedures,such as temperature checks & check-in customers outside, sanitizer dispensers, and sneeze guards installed.
AAA recommend to wait in the car, and when your appointment is ready, you will receive a text.
Overall, I feel AAA has done everything to protect its customers, & employees.
I just wish they could pick up the phone.  I wanted to make sure that I am brining the right documents to avoid going back again.  Sadly, no one at the branch answered the phone. (I do understand, with COVID, everyone is shorthanded though)< /review>< Time>

Quick and easy!! During this pandemic, this branch made it so easy to renew my registration in person. I didnt even step foot in the building. An employee by the name of Jeff took care of me right outside the building where its nice and open. Bring cash or check! No cc.<//review>

Overall the service is great however today there legendary service fell down I realize that every business has rules and procedures.
Yesterday my son was stuck with a dead battery and I was unable to get to him for a jump.
I called AAA and was told because he wasn't on my account they couldn't help unless I was there with my card, they wouldn't take the information on the phone.
I've been a member for 50 years and was told the only way they could help was for me to pay for a membership for my son.
That kind of service is unacceptable to me I'm in a service business and there are exceptions to the rules... 50 years of membership me t nothing to the clerk on the phone or his supervisor.

The legendary service that John Boyle boasts of wasn't there today.
Maybe he needs to re think his training plans.

Most times it's a great service. Considerably faster than going to DMV. I only had one  troublesome instance.
I paid and filed for an address change and tags on my vehicle twice (by the same employee) and both times they never submitted the paperwork to DMV correctly. Could have been DMV not correcting my address twice...for 2 yrs...but doubtful. For some reason DMV (on the 5th and 6th yr of owning my car)my registration/tags kept getting sent to an arbitrary address. I got fed up and had to line myself at the actual DMV for the whole day to get it done right...I had to pay for that as well🙄
Other than that one mess, this Auto club gives excellent timely services.< /Text>

<text>I started driving lessons with AAA in December so I would be able to take behind the wheel driving test to get my license. Even before the pandemic they would schedule my lessons months apart and provide terrible service. It should have been able to get my listens in January. It is now July and I still have two lessons to go. Now I won't have a listens for summer and am still receiving terrible service.</text>< user>

<review>Businesses have opened up again,  we called the operator to ensure notary services were happening and we got a positive. When we arrived to the AAA office, we were denied stating due to covid notaries weren't happening. No effort into practicing proper guideline for a signature service is asinine. Not one referral to a different notary location nor any info on reimbursement since we are now having to outsource a notary office.< /review><user_name>Le Foo</user_name>< resp>

I just went in to see my agent to make sure I had all paperwork complete for my new policy.  I expected a fairly long wait since I did not have an appointment. I have to say I was completely floored at how friendly, professional and efficient everyone was. Pleasantly surprised!< /Review>

My husband and I had Farmers Insurance (car & rentals). We decided to compare pricing with other insurance companies. We chose AAA after reading reviews on J.D. Power.  We got a much better deal with AAA and we want to personally thank Ana Peraza (Insurance Sales Agent)  for being  professional,  Informative and having the best office. Her office decor was  Calming and Peaceful no stress transition. Thank you again AAA.<//Text>

Ashley (from Leeds) is THE BEST! She got me all set up with an international driver’s permit for my upcoming trip to Australia/SE Asia, and found me an awesome selection of maps for my camping trips in the next few days. She helped me with aspects of my travels where I didn’t even know I needed help. Thanks Ashley, and thanks to all the other AAA employees at Long Beach who have made my life so much simpler over the years!< /Text>

I always come here, but today around 4:15
I went inside, I needed valuable information to register a car, young white lady was in a mood.
She didn’t even say hello, rude, and think she knows everything about Registration, information that should be provided by a competent person, but she didn’t let me pass the reception.
She should not be working there.<//Text>

<Text>They kept me cover and protected for the last 10 years.  Coverages payment are reasonable.  Great Insurance company to be with.  Corporate Office location very nice.  Plenty of parking.  Also has plenty of employment opportunities for someone whom might  be interesting in that field of work.<//Text>< rating>

<Review>I like AAA but in the last few years its prices have more than doubled (auto insurance) and the quality of its services decreased.
Last time I requested a tow,  it took AAA well over an hour to arrive.... really?
I think a bit too long,  or is it just me?< /Review>< user_id>

< Review>
I've been a AAA Premier member for 21 years. However this was the worst service I've ever endured. The driving instructor assigned to my  daughter was terrible. The only number given was a number to leave a message. between myself, my Daughter and my wife we left over 10 messages over 4 weeks before we got a call back. Finally we got to schedule a class. The instructor Virginia was rude! made my daughter feel terrible. She hated the experience. It was the absolute worst person you can imagine. I think the driving instructors are super disgruntled and overworked. please don't put your child through it. I hired another company soon after and the experience has been great.
SAVE YOUR CHILD. DO NOT USE THIS SCHOOL.< /Review>

<review>I've used this AAA now for I think 24 years. I turned 40 July 27rh and if I'm not mistaken I think it might have been there when I got my license at 16 maybe it was built a little later. But I've had a AAA Membership since 16. Although due to youthful indiscretions I wasn't always able to afford them as my auto insurance company I'm so stoked at 40 that my yearly auto breaks down to $37  a month for full coverage uninsured/underinsured motorists, comprehensive and collision with quite low deductibles. As a currently non-practing insurance agent I if course opted for a renters policy since I'm aware the multi policy discount is so impact on ur auto premium the renter insurance ends up being free and it actually lowers your yearly auto premium more when compared annually.
I use them for all dmv registration services i am able to as well THEY are so friendly and quite accommodating</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

We love AAA we love all those services and we liked everything about AAA the three stars is not because of their service is because of the fact that there  for long beach location they don't take debit cards they only take check or cash which we feel is not very good since we are now in the technological era we're really nobody writes checks anymore everything's done by debit card.< /review>

Outstanding! If you have to visit one of their offices it is so much better than ever having to go to DMV. You whizz right through everywhere you need to go no. I've never waited longer than 10 minutes before my name was called. I have yet to use any of their on the road services but from what I hear they are spectacular also. I bought my Towing insurance from AAA just to avoid DMV and boy wasn't worth it plus the bonus Ave getting help if I run out of gas get a flat tire or need tow Taylor closest repair shop. I even purchased the coverage for my motorcycle which will also cover my RV when I decide to get one or should I say afford one. Basically can't go wrong.< /review>

I love the company after 25+ years, the new arrangements is CRAZY.
NO LOUD SPEAKERS ANYMORE the employees has to leave there area to come into the lobby to call your name and then walk back to their desk with you trailing behind them.
DMV desk is the only one, when you walk inside you can continue and get in line and wait for them. The best part is being able to walk in the door and check in and to know that you will be assistant and they always give a complimentary Waters.
I forgot to mention the customer service there they are always on top! And you know I didn't forget my maps because I am definitely going to be tearing up the country this summer.😁< /text>

This is a very efficient setup there.  Tell the front desk what you need and they send you off to the specialty you need.  Beats the DMV, but getting a proctolgy exam would be better than the DMV</Text>

It may be better then sitting at the DMV but that ismt saying much . Called monday to find out late registration fees on my nephews car asked they told me the rate and said i could come in and pay it . So i wasted my time today going in and was told he had to be a member inorder to pay his registration.  That would be fine had i not paid my girls reg at the same branch a few months ago with no issue . Why was it fine then and not now .
This allong with having to argue with two drivers .when they try and tell me my personal truck cant be towed because they are claiming it is a work truck!  There is no rack, no box ,and no tools in the back that would qualify this as a work truck ! The driver is just trying to get extra cash !
Dont get me started anout their rip off insurance . If you have drop it they will fight you to pay out and up your rate regardless of full coverage . I had to do the work my self because all the shops they work with said they cant do a flat black paint job ?🤔🤦‍♂️🖕👎<//Text>

This is an all around great place. You can get roadside assistance as well as home and auto insurance, and renters insurance here as well as avoid the hassle of spending hours at the DMV. By being able to take car of your business there. And it's not a long lines or a long wait. You get a complimentary bottle of water and they sell other little things such as maps, puzzle,and games for the family while on the road. The only bad thing is if you're renewing your registration for you vehicle you can only pay cash...< /text>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>AAA is the best place to take care of your DMV  needs with out the lines that are usual at DMV.  You can get plates for your car, renew  registration,  transfer titles everything except drivers licence renewal.  But that's not all they also offer insurance for car, home,apartment and life.. They they can help you plan a trip  foreign or domestic and have a vast array of maps to keep you from getting lost.
They're always friendly and professional

<Text>I have been here on three separate occasions, and all three visits have been unsatisfactory. The first time, they were closed because it was lunchtime. This time I was sent away because I wanted to pay my vehicle's registration and could not because the car is in my daughter's name.  I will opt to use the DMV; It's just as disappointing and no annual fee.  So long AAA. Three strikes and you are out!!!< /Text>< Rate>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Can't say enough about how wonderful AAA is. From the roadside assistance. To the DMV services and car registration. Do your driver's license and movie tickets it's amazing. Not only that but the wonderful Westways magazines you can never go wrong. My friend changed from Progressive to AAA while standing in the DMV line I highly recommend anyone that wants to get any service is done through the DMV. Must go to AAA. Thanks AAA for all the help you've done for me and my family through all these years.< /review></record>

<text>Incredibly rude staff. I got called up and the two employees were trash talking a previous customer, making remarks on how he was stupid for not bringing a title or something. I understand frustration from working in retail but trash talking a customer in front of a customer is shameful. Go to another branch if you can.</text><gmapID>0x80dd3221a2c6976f:0x8722eac64a11bf48<//gmapID><user>104075401563931490025<//user>< resp>

<text>(Translated by Google) They do not give good advice I asked someone who spoke Spanish and I was attended by a girl who supposedly did not understand much wanted to register a car that she buys but if someone is interested the first thing she has to do is the smog and the other in the purchase register You should not place that I bought it more than a month ago because they are fined and the payment increases ... I hope it will be useful if you want to do the same procedure
