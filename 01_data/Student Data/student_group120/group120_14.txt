While I was 2nd in front of the line one of the workers came by asking us what we here for . I told I'm here renewal registration and was told to wait. Down the line I heard someone talk in Spanish saying the same thing to the worker and they went ahead me with 5 other people. Not cool.< /review>

<review>Worst agency to deal with.
There becomes a point where audits should be mandatory.
This place is slow and very rude the people dont help you and if you ask a question they act like you are asking them for something imposible for them.
You know when they say sometimes employers clean out house. This is the place that actually needs it.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>That was my first time in Madera dmv. All the employees were very professional and passionate towards their job. Not even a single employee disappoints you. I have been to fresno dmv but i never got this kind of service before. At the end I would like to say to government please appoint all the professional employees in just one dmv. We need these kind of service everywhere.< /Text>< time>

Went today at 5:00 a.m., the man in front us was treating very rudely by the tall, white employee(woman) because he couldn't speak very well in English.  Also another spanish speaking couple was also treated just as bad. I think there's a trend with this lady, and I use the term loosely.  I thought the dmv  employeed were retrained  to be friendlier, this woman must have missed that class.<//review>

During these difficult times of the COVID 19 I would like to thank the Madera’s DMV (Employee’s) for being open and coming to work knowing a deadly virus is around. But armed with clean and sanitation sectors through out the building, makes this a safe and friendly environment for those concerned of contracting an infection/virus. My experience was exceeded of how friendly and fast these folks work, remember there working none stop all day lines after lines of folks coming in. Treat with respect and revive respect. patience is the number one key to success. Stay safe folks. Care for one another. Until next time. Over and out.<//review>

Went for a scheduled driving test appointment at 1pm, came at 12:15. The front desk clerk told us to stand on the red carpet. After standing there for 15 minutes with no clerk working at the window, we sat down at the chairs in front of the red carpet. Twice we went back to ask if we are at the right lane and if we need a ticket with a number. Then the same clerk went by and saw we were sitting there waiting. At 1:15 someone finally came to the window, asked a name of a person who came 40 minutes after us. We then stood and went to that red line. When we finally got to the window, the clerk told us we were late and marked us as no show.
The reason they used was we were not standing on the red carpet, so she did not see us. The manager supported it and said we could wait as a stand-by. We did not and left without being served.</Text>

Went to DMV Madera for my Road test last week. Right away they accommodate us. (I have an appointment in the morning). It’s my third time taking the test for 3 different DMVs but this one was really great. My driving tester her name is Linda. She looked real strict but she’s actually real good at her job. Her instructions on which directions to go were clear and involves pointing with her hand so you have enough time to maneuver correctly. I passed it.< /Text>

<Review>DMV RAVE!
I put this off until the very last second and right up to the 23rd hour and 59th second to the deadline of getting my tags. Before the penalty phase started.
The parking lot was full but there were a couple open spaces~The chairs were all filled and the line was long for no appt. but moving right along at a quick clip.
I got in line for this hidden gem in the corner. Only 6 people in front of me.
I love <3 this little Blue & Yellow machine! Even though it takes your money faster then a slot machine and it doesn't care if it is bent, folded or ripped! IT TAKES IT ALL AS IS!! It wants your MONEY!!
BAM! I was in and out within 10 minutes and that includes getting parked, into the DMV office and getting out of the parking lot!!
LOVE <3 THAT Blue & Yellow machine, I even left with my tags in hand!!< /Review>< gmapID>

Anything to make you come back to this hell hold of a DMV. What more information do you need when ive had my license for over 20 years.

<Review>This is a Typical DMV, You just have to pick you times and schedule an appointment if you want to be in and out with the least amount of hassle.
Also it helps if you come with all the paperwork you can think you might need. People are friendly and helpful in guiding you. I've been in and out of this DMV in as little as 30 minutes and at other times it's take 2 hours.</Review>< name>

Wait time here is horrible the staff just keeps on talking and giggling with each other or just starting conversations with customers theres no need for that, the guy standing by the door seems to have no knowledge of any questions that's been asked everyone here just gives the runaround to people sending them back in forth for the same forms. Management needs to step it up or get fired.<//review>

<text>SEE UPDATE AT END OF FIRST PART.

Hey, it's the DMV. You know what it is like, Why are you reading a review? They are all the same.  Long lines, confusion, screaming kids, getting sent to the wrong window, fining out they suddenly want another document that you do not have on you so you have to come back again etc etc.  It is the DMV, we all know the game.
UPDATE.  The government has come down hard on the DMV for accepting millions in gov funding to update and streamline then spending all the funds and not updating or improving service. As a result the DMV is running scared and has recently updated their computer system and have greatly improved customer service and speed.  They are much better now. Updated review from 2 to 4 stars.<//text>< GmapID>

< Review>
When I went to get my permit it wasn't bad I did have to wait quite a while but I did what I needed to go and got out of there it is rather small & soon I'm going to take my behind the wheel test so can anyone help me on what route they go on?  Please and thank you<//Review>

<review>Very slow service. More than half the windows have no one manning it even when the place is packed to the rafters with clients all the while seeing some employees just walking around and chatting with each other with no sense of urgency. This office needs to undergo a major overhaul.  VEry poor and inefficient service. Worst place to get your license and I've been around different places in the US this truly takes the cake as the worst.</review>< pictures>

Poor customer service. They don't help and they pass everyone else first before they help out even if you have an appointment you won't be helped. They have no clue what there doing here they clearly hired the wrong people to work here!</Text>

<Date>1528946603128</Date><rate>1</rate><review>Worst service ever I went a couple of weeks ago around 4 without a appointment line was out the door and I needed to renew my license I took all the needed paperwork for the renewal and I paid the fees due but apparently it was to late to take a 18 question test so I was told to just come another day to take the test and I didn’t need a appointment when I returned for the test I just had to go to the Drivers license renewal line as long as I was there before 4:30. So today I went around 4pm after work, went to the line that I was instructed to go in the beginning then I was told otherwise I had to the walk-in line then and by the time I got to the front it was 4:30 and was told it was to late to take a 18 question test I explain what I was instructed to do by this point I was really fusterated it seemed these employees were not on the same page and are telling people different things and they talk to you with no respect. I was treated like if I was ruining there day, I mean we come from working all day and then having to go into a DMV Office that is always full and I mean You wait hours in this place and only half of the stations are working what is wrong with this picture!! Customer service is very shity, wait time is horrible, I mean I would’ve made an appointment to take the test but I was told not to because everything was done I just need to take a 18 question test, I went back to my car empty handed after an hour and half I was just so irritatred and upset that I couldn’t do anything. Please provide better training and please  educate them that their there to help us and that most of us work all day and unfortunately sometimes we have to make these DMV trips and then put up with horrible customer service when you get here, come on now!!!  I think they forget who’s serving who!! And if you don’t have people skills why r u working at DMV please look for another job!! DMV Fresno I’ll be seeing you soon!</review>< pics>

<review>The people are slow and rude, they spent a lot of time just talking with each other even though there were like 40 people in line. I had an appointment at 2 waited in line for 30 min. For them just to tell my to go to another window. By the time I got to it, it was 2:09 and had marked me down as a no-show. Overall it was a horrible experience.</review><rating>1< /rating>< Time>

Waste of time my little brothers appointment was at 3 had to wait in line finally got to the counter workers says sorry we can't give you the test we start to kick every one out at 4:30and it was 3:50 when there's only 2 people taking the test and like 8 other computers available  that's why there's a closing time you don't stop taking people in until that time always something with those emplyes always people storming off when I visit the dmv there always in a bad mood should not be working if in a bad mood it just provides a bad image for them selves<//Text>

What a nightmare!!!!!
They screwed up on my appointment. After waiting an hour I noticed my # said non-appt. Got back in line and was given a appt. # with an " I'm so sorry". Waited again! Got called and teller tells me she cannot clear up vehicle suspension, but its easy to do online, by mail or call the automated voice system. I told her noooooo, easier would be if she was able to take care of it now.
On the notice of change of address form it states. " Your mailing address may be given to requesters providing a valid reason for requesting the information. She could not tell me who " authorized requesters " are, so I didn't want to sign it. Seems like they want to upset you into walking out so they can go back to there dazed state of mind. Privatize DMV.<//text>

If I could rate them a zero I would. They don’t provide instructions clearly which means more trips to the DMV. They literally had me going back and fourth when I was just trying to register a car in my name. Worst place to go. The staff is rude also.< /text>

(Translated by Google) I went at 2 in the afternoon and with the heat we were trained and they did not attend us and the worst thing is that they did not tell us anything, I recommend them in fresno

<Text>(Translated by Google) They have a very efficient management, the staff (not all) speak Spanish, we must help them by paying attention to the progressive numbers.

I have been coming here for years so not sure why I haven’t written a review yet.  I have been going to Curtis for my haircut, hair color and keratin treatments.  I don’t just love the outcome, but love that he takes his time with the process.  Everyone in the salon is very professional and friendly.  During covid they have had a safety first approach.< /review>

I have been coming to Veesun for 16 years. He loves his work and it shows. He is a master colorist and cuts your hair with love.</review>

Words cannot describe how incredible this salon is. I have gone to my stylist Veesun many times over the course of several years now. I have temporarily moved to Palm Springs & will still make the drive to go see him. Veesun is an actual magician when it comes to my heavy head of hair & I refuse to go to anyone else. There is no exaggeration when I say that the end result is always perfection. Before he starts, Veesun will have a consultation with you to make sure you get exactly what you're asking for. You can tell he is beyond in love with his profession & treats your hair like a masterpiece. He is without a doubt the definition of a true artist & I couldn't be more grateful to have found him.</Text>

<Review>I am stuck  like a glue lol to Veesun from Hair Concept 2000 in Woodland Hills. So many salons nearby my house but can’t risk the outcome of a new look. With Veesun it’s guaranteed a 100%  satisfaction so why waste time and money somewhere else? What an amazing talent or gift he has making you feel and look  great coming out of the salon. My daughter who’s 12 started going to him for haircut and hairstyle last year and she won’t  dare go somewhere else anymore. One time, I took her  to a salon that’s a mile away from my house (just for my convenience so I don’t have to drive far) and she didn’t like how she looks. Of course back to Veesun!!! lol.  For 2 years now that I had been going I tried to observe how everyone else work on this salon and I have never seen anyone look bad. Every hairdressers  that works here are GIFTED! Clients always look great leaving this place. Highly, highly recommended!!!<//Review>< user>

<Text>I've been going to Hair Concept 2000 for a while now but my first time writing a review. The many times I've been I've never been disappointed once. I can always trust them with my hair no matter what I do (perms, cut, etc). I've had my hair cut by multiple stylists and I can assure you, they were all amazing but Yun is hands down the best! Would highly highly recommend :)</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

My go to hairstylist is named Julie. She's awesome. She's been doing my hair for over 8 - 9 years now, and I couldn't be more grateful for her. I have only ever gotten compliments on my haircut since I started going to her.
Thanks for making me look good, Julie!< /Review>

She has a great eye and is very precise with her measurements. She took her time and got the shape drawn out just right and then she has a little room in the back that is private and very clean. I like the way she did my brows much better than the last time I had them done elsewhere and would highly recommend her to anyone looking to get their brows worked on!!!

<text>I’ve been going to hair concept for quite some time but due to COVID 19, my hair stylist was unable to cut my hair so they referred me to one of their hair stylist’s named Ava who cut my hair.  It was the WORST HAIR CUT I’ve had in my life.. it was all chopped up.. I couldn’t believe it because I paid 83 dls for a professional to do it but it’s obvious this hair stylist had NO idea how to cut hair.

Because the hair cut was so bad, I asked the receptionist if I could to talk to the owner of the salon about how unsatisfied I was with the end result. She told me the owner was busy and that he would give me a call back but he never did.. I called again, and the receptionist told me she was with a client and that he couldn’t take my call but she said he will call me back once he’s done with a client.. long story short, he never cared to call so I decided to call 30 min before the salon closes and the  manner in which the owner spoke to me was rude and the way this was handled was unprofessional.

The tone of his voice was angry, he even raised his voice at me. I couldn’t believe he felt like he could raise his voice at me when I was both polite and patient to hear back from him..

Also, the receptionist apologized to me when he realized no one got back to me after 6 hours. At least she had manners and a sense of customer service.

The only good thing I got from this was that I got a refund in the end.. other than that, it was a nightmare getting your hair chopped up and then getting yelled at for something that wasn’t my fault! Terrible customer service!!<//text>< Name>

I’ve known Veesun’s work for many many years. I’m finally able to go to him and wow! He has a great hand, great eye and amazing scissors. He is doing what he was born to do. I’m so glad I found him again. PS I drive 45 mins to see him.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Had my first hair cut here and I'm very impressed. And that is coming from a man who's grandfather and mother and mother in law were barbers/hair stylists. Neda did up a nice style for me that made me feel hip and younger (I'm turning 50 this year). Definitely worth a try. Already recommended a friend and she loved her hair style as well.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I called the salon and the girl that answered placed me on hold for a few minutes, after I asked her if they do paraffin with manicure, while I was on hold listened to their rap music, trying to figure out why there was profanity in the hold music, she came back on the phone but didn’t answer...instead she hung up on me. 😳 Like wth?! 😧 Hello? 😟 so if that’s how their customer service is on the phone, I can only imagine how the experience would be in person. No THANK YOU! I will take my money somewhere else that values their customers.<//Review>

As a guy who had only gone to walk-in barber shops in the past, I was fairly intimidated by trying out a hair salon.  I had only really had one simple hair style for most of my adult life and for the longest time I hadn't thought much of it.  But once I decided to change things up and grow out my hair a little bit, my barber didn't seem to have a clue what to do.  And honestly, I was a bit lost myself on what styles would fit me - I was new at this too!

After several failed attempts at finding a new hair cut (at many different barber shops, mind you) I finally gave in.  I came to Hair Concept (it was actually Hair Sanctuary the first time I came) and I'll admit I was a bit uncomfortable at first.  I was out of my comfort zone.  I think they were able to notice this because several of the stylists made sure to greet me even though they were focused on their clients.  It could have been because they had never seen me before and knew I was a new client, but everyone seemed extremely polite and welcoming.

I waited for a couple minutes before Samantha was ready for me.  I told her my history and what I was hoping to accomplish and that I could definitely use her input.  We actually discussed this for several minutes.  She would give me suggestions and I would voice my concerns.  I loved how she didn't try to push anything on me, she seemed invested to find a style that I would actually enjoy (and stick with!).  Eventually we both had a good understanding of what cut I would go with.  Samantha was very friendly.  She isn't one of those stylists that needs to fill every second with small talk, which I'm glad for.  But she is nice to talk to, which is good because I think it's important to build a relationship with your hair stylist.  As for the cut itself, I loved it!  I realized that there was no way I could have stayed at my previous barber and asked them for this cut.  I've returned to Samantha three times now and I haven't been disappointed.  Every cut I've had is consistent.  I also have her show me different ways I can apply product which is very helpful.  Overall, I'm extremely happy I found this place!!< /Text>

Although a relatively new patron to Hair Concept 2000 Salon I have been a regular customer of Olivia's for some time now. I followed her from a previous salon because she is THAT GOOD!! I regularly ask for different, odd, weird, unique,  haircuts and colors and she has been up to the challenge and fulfills my every request (old Punks never ever die but they do DYE!) Last year my mother came to visit me from Texas and when I picked her up at the airport I said something to her about her hair. My mother lamented about being unable to find anyone in Texas with the ability to manage and cut her naturally curly hair and multiple "cowlicks". Olivia was able to fit my mother in on short notice and did a fantastic job cutting it to my mother's liking. My mother now looks forward to her visits for more than just checking in with me but to see Olivia in order to get her hair done correctly.<//text>

Both are fabulous at whatever you could possibly want them to do. The shop is brand new, beautifully remodeled into a clean, crisp salon that still feels warm and friendly, low key but high class surroundings you can relax in.  It's always a nice experience to be there! The salon always feels more like family where everyone knows your name even when you call, the coffee is always ready, and you know you will leave with the look you were hoping for or better.

I've referred many friends here and they are equally as happy - one used to fly out from Chicago just for color and cut! He's an amazing stylist - but his hours rival his styling prowess!! He's available all hours and times. Family business too, which is always a plus. His son, Curtis is awesome too!!<//Review><user_name>Kristina Ferrin< /user_name>< user>

<review>Samantha Loh is by far one if the best hair stylist I've ever encountered. Her kind and sweet demeanor is equally matched by her phenomenal hair skills. I get both hair extensions and a Brazilian blow out. Samantha always is so diligent and makes you look amazing. And my hair extension look so real! I always get compliments and people asking me who does my hair. The Brazilian blow out is done to perfection. Go to her and you won't be disappointed!!<//review>< Rating>

<text>So I saw that this place had amazing reviews and therefore wanted to give it a try. I was very very apprehensive about the whole process as it was very unconventional and was not making me feel comfortable at all. During the entire process of hair wash - hair color - hair cut - blow dry, I thought I had made a horrible decision and had my fingers crossed. BUT, the end result was beautiful ! Its been a while since I got this done and the compliments on the color and cut have not stopped. Absolutely revisiting !!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I have been going to another hair stylist for a long time but she only works on Saturdays. I get a manicure from Terri and I decided to try getting a cut and color from Curtis (owners son).  Great job!  I am VERY picky about my hair.  He has a good personality and is an artist with the hair at affordable prices.  I highly recommend that you go see Curtis.  He is the man!

I am a regular with Susan who takes great care of my nails. She helped me to recover from many years of nail neglect and abuse. Her massages are divine. It is a pleasure to come see her regularly and be greeted professionally, with a big smile, great energy and an excellent service.
Salon has been renamed recently, but it is easy to find right across Trader Joe's on Ventura Blvd in Woodland Hills. Parking is behind the salon and is convenient.
The place is bright and clean, friendly and has a good vibe. If you would like extensions - ask for Sam, she has done a great job for me.</text>

<Text>This salon is a gem! I am so happy I stumbled upon it. Curtis has been styling my hair for months and I'm addicted to his blow outs.  He is also an expert in color and today Curtis is giving me a Brazilian Blowout. They recently revamped the salon and they offer nail services, skin care, make-up, the works!

The person who cut my hair didn’t seem to care about my hair. I asked for a trim but with some movement (wispy layers) and he just basically gave me a basic trim and finished me off with a quick blow dry within 10-15 minutes or so. My hair looked bland, boring, and lifeless and as if he didn’t even do anything. Definitely not worth $55.< /review>

<text>Curtis has been my go-to for 4 years and I followed him here to Hair Concept 2000 in Woodland Hills. He's the only one that can do my short hair! Everyday (and I'm not exaggerating), I get stopped and complimented on my hair - yoga, walking on the streets, grocery stores, meetings - you name it. He's extremely talented and I've referred many of my friends and complete strangers to go visit him. Needless to say they love his work and have become regulars as well.

I've been coming to this hair salon for over 10 years now and I have never had a bad hair cut or color.  Veesun does the best haircuts of any stylist I've ever been to. The salon has been recently remodeled and it's beautiful.  I would highly recommend Veesun.  He works more than any other human I know and he will find a time to fit your schedule.  Even if it's a Sunday or 7am in the morning.  Definitely call and make an appointment.< /Review>

Been going to this place for six years now and wouldn't change it for anything in the world!

I have been having my waxing done with Danielle in so long, that we've become family. Her attention to detail and care are out of this world. I come from Europe and I am very picky about who touched my hair and face, and Danielle gets that. She gets me and gets what I want.

I always schedule my appointments ahead of time and then we just confirm the day before by text. She's super easy to communicate with over text and never had a cancellation or move or anything like that.

Don't ever try the neighbourhoody Indian places please!!! Respect yourself and go to Danielle!!<//text>

<Review>Just went to Samantha Loh for color and highlights, and the whole experience were wonderful again! I am so grateful to have finally found someone I can trust with my color. I have tried countless salons and been so disappointed. With Samantha, she really has the skill to make it look exactly how I want it. I brought in pictures, which she checked out, then gave me a few thoughts to make the look work even better. We agreed on a direction, then she went to work and I totally LOVED it after! My hair is still in good condition even with lots of highlighting (I like an ombre / beach look with lots of blond at ends). It makes it a total win-win every time I come in.

Can't recommend her highly enough! Samantha the best!</Review>< Pictures>

I recently had my hair cut prior before coming here and the women completely butchered my hair , I walked in nervous about getting it done but it had to be fixed . Curtis is by far the best hair dresser I have had, he fixed the deep cuts that she did evened it out and did exactly what I wanted . I will forever go to him and I recommend him to anyone , hes awesome and does an amazing job, The prices aren't expensive and definitely worth every penny.</review>

<review>Yosi redid a keratin treatment even though he fixed the issue he was semi bulling me. He was not to happy to fix his error. He even suggested to relocate my old hair dresser. Will never go back. My friend who also did her keratin with him didn't even go back for a redo for the way he was with me. He plays nice but also puts you down. Like saying... at your age you should know better. The salon is very nice btw and the owner even cared tp open the windows for air. For the salon I give it a 5 but for the hairdresser a 0</review>< gmap_id>

I have been going to Terri Tran for pedicures for over 15 years and wouldn't go anywhere else! I am paranoid about cleanliness and I totally trust her. She always does a great job and is super sweet and timely, not to mention that she gives the best foot and leg massage! Also, I have been going to Danielle for eyelash color and eyebrow waxing for the same amount of time. I hate wearing make-up when I'm not at work because I have very sensitive eyes and with the color I can get away with it. Being blond, it's nice to be able to see my eyelashes and eyebrows! She also gave me a facial before I got married and it was fantastic. I coordinate with Danielle and Terri to get both my eyes and a pedicure done during the same visit and go there every 2-3 weeks. Henni does my hair and is amazing with color! I am SUPER picky about my hair color. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Even though I moved to Simi-Valley I still make the drive. Highly recommended!</Text>

I've been coming here for over 5 years.  I think it is very difficult to find a hair stylist that you are both comfortable with and will listen to what you really want out of your hair.  I have been to very many places and worked with a number of hair stylist but no one gets my wants and needs like Samantha does.  She's patient and will give you her honest opinion on what will work for your hair.  The time goes by super fast also because she's very easy to talk to.

Also a huge issue with me is that my hair is really long and everytime I go somewhere else to get it trimmed, they usually do what they want and cut of more inches than I requested!  Sammi really tells me her honest opinion when I go in for a trim, but if I really want my hair to be 2-3 inches less..she will really listen to my request and cut only that.

Really though, finding a hair stylist that is easy to talk to and does great work is very rare.  I suggest you find out her next available appointment asap!  The salon is easy to find and there's a roomy lot in the back.</text>

I've been coming here for nearly 15 years and Henni has always taken excellent care of me. She’s very warm and friendly, professional and consistently does great work. Henni stays current on hair trends and keeps up with the latest techniques to share with her loyal clientele.  She remembers, in surprising detail, all the things you've shared with her whether it’s a hair style you've been nervous about trying or something about your personal life. I've recommended many a friend and they always come out loving their new look. I get compliments on my hair all the time and it’s all thanks to the amazing work of Henni. If you want a quality cut this is definitely the place to go, the rest of the staff is also very friendly and professional.< /Review>

<text>I have been a client of this salon for over ten years(if not longer). I wouldn't trust anyone with my hair except Veesun. He knows how to cut hair and color my hair beautifully. My hair always comes out perfectly. The place is very classy and professional. The professionalism has just increased over the years.
Lately, I've enjoyed the skills of Veesun's son, Curtis, I never thought I would ever give up his dad. Curtis  does a better job than his dad! Just kidding Veesun. I get  a beautiful cut and luscious color every time.< /text>< Pics>

What can I say this salon is amazing. I've been going to Veesun for the last 5 years and can not say enough amazing things he has done for my hair, taking me from a blonde to brunette back to blonde again and well you get the point. I most recently came in with, what I allowed my friend to do, the worst orange brassy hair, him and his son Curtis transformed my hair with the worlds best color correction. I would travel the world to have him do my hair and will never allow anyone else to ever touch my hair! They are both AMAZING!!!!!!! What are u waiting for?< /text>

<text>I've been a client of Veesun's for about 17 years.  I am very picky about my haircuts and Veesun consistently gives great cuts that suit my hair, face and lifestyle--and I always receive compliments.  I moved away from CA about 7 years ago, and still have Veesun cut my hair every 11 weeks.  He is one of the major reasons I still travel to CA.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c29eb9ae8ea189:0xcc7dae569ba27b3<//GmapID></record>

<Text>I've been coming here for over 15 years. I go to Danielle who is the only esthetician in the Salon. She is amazing! She has been in the business for over 30 years and gives the most incredible facials. She is very skilled at eyebrow shapes and individual eyelash extensions and her makeup is the best! The product she sell, Dermalogica, is the best for any skin type. It keeps my skin clear, smooth and bright. Definitely would recommend Danielle any day!

The customer service is wonderful. I also go to Sami who does my hair. She is so sweet and really understands what i want. She gets my color right every time! I have very fine hair and she is so knowledgable about treatments i should try and shampoos i should use. She always makes my hair full of body even though it is so thin.

Love Hair Concept!</Text>< Pics>

I've been coming to Veesun at Hair Concept 2000 for many years and I always leave with a big smile on my face! Veesun, Curtis, and Sami are masters at hair, beauty, and everything in between! They took care of me for my first set of highlights, the first time I went from brunette to blonde, prom, and this time next year for my wedding! I can't recommend them enough for their great work, vision for beauty, and making me feel like family! Here is to a lifetime of good people with great hearts and stunning hair!</Text>

<Review>I've been going to  Veesun for over 30 years now (wow that makes me feel old!) and I wouldn't  want to go anywhere else!  I've been to other salons but Hair Concept  2000  is by far the BEST!!!  My whole family comes here and we have all been loyal to Veesun for years!  Veesun gives me perfect natural looking highlights and fabulous cuts and styles.  I recently purchased extensions through Veesun's niece, Samantha and everyone has commented on how perfectly she matched the color and how natural they look.  She has been styling my extensions and making me look and feel like I've always had thick, long, gorgeous hair!  Thank you Veesun, Sam and all of the amazing staff at Hair Concept 2000 in Woodland Hills!  I love you!!< /Review>< Pics>

I have been coming to HC since 1996 Veesun is only person I trust with my naturally curly natural blonde hair, there is true talent in this salon every single client leaves here looking their absolute best, if you need color you can trust their expert application and amazing consistent results, curly to straight best method best results especially for curly hair.  Veesun is the Grand Master of hair and his genuine spirit and humor are refreshing.  Chrissyspecial recommends for color, highlights, cut,style and don't forget your specialized products!< /Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>I have been going to hair concept for over 10 years and my "go to" hair stylist is Samantha aka Sami.
I go to her for ALL my regular hair cut /color and for all my special events for up do's and styling.

Let me just say that Sami is a amazing stylist. Every time I go to her, I know that I will always walk away with great hair. I am  picky with my hair and every time I go to Sami with a new hair cut idea or new color I want to try, she is always able to do exactly what I wanted. Even when I do not know what I want to do with my hair, I trust Sami 100% on being creative and I trust her judgement/ recommendations. ( this says alot because as I said before, I am picky)

Not only is Sami very talented but she is warm and friendly too.  I really feel like I am treated special when I go to her.  I recommend Sami to all my family and friends because you can never go wrong when you sit in her chair.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Review>This is outstanding service for a coffee shop! Alex, one of their workers, was the one who replied to my inquiries. Because of his polite and professional attitude, I was able to relax. The best of everything! It has been a huge relief for me to arrive at this beautiful location. Your low-cost, high-quality service comes highly recommended! Thank you once more for everything.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80e9ace3f6f5beb1:0xdca756f941f077d3</gmapID></record>

Cafe Zack's was a very pleasant discovery. It's a fresh and tasty gem tucked in that cute little house. I will return for sure, and soon! My salmon was so tasty, perfectly grilled and seasoned. My salad was lightly dressed and very fresh. Quite a good meal!<//review>

I went to get take out of the halibut fish tacos special today. These are the best local fish tacos around, so fresh. They have a new socially distanced outdoor seating patio in the back that they have been working on for months, so I ended up sitting in the sun under an umbrella and enjoying the palm trees and the food.</review>

A special treat. Ordered dinner for the first time in many years (and first time in pandemic) and the food is still amazing. This restaurant is a prime example of how simple ingredients cooked with expertise can become divine. Eating here was a treat and we can't wait to come back here next time</text>

Five star review for a five star meal! I was hosting a large group so I got to try many of their specialties and everything was positively fabulous!!!! My teenager even tried the apple pork medallions which he loved and that is quite a testament coming from a very picky teen. We are going to attempt to duplicate them soon but I don't think we'll be able to come close to Cafe Zack. Great experience, outstanding food and exemplary service. Thank you for an awesome experience Cafe Zack!!!!<//text>

How many times have you dined out for dinner and while eating said to those around you, "This food is really amazing, It's just incredible." If you are like me, not too many. Cafe Zack is one of those rare restaurants where that can happen and it happened to us this past Tuesday evening. What's most interesting is that Cafe Zack has been in business in Ventura for more than 25 years and it's one of those rare restaurants that started out very good and has even gotten better over the years.<//text>

<Text>Stopping there for lunch on a rainy week day, my husband had the Executive Burger and still states that it's the best one he's ever had. The meat had a wonderful flavor, was cooked to perfection with a crusty exterior and juicy center, and the bread was crusty and soft at the same time. He still dreams of going back and having it again. I had a delicious salad with a light dressing and a perfectly cooked salmon. Coffee was good too as was the friendly service< /Text>< response>

Food was incredible. I loved every bite.
This is a very small romantic place that would be great for a date night (I say this even though I was eating alone hah).
Most of the people there had reservations, I was lucky enough to get the last table without one.
They we're out of the wild boar so I got the peppercorn encrusted filet mignon which was served with potatoes and fresh veggies. The filet was buttery the potatoes were rich the veggies we're crunchy and sweet. Yeah the meal was fantastic.
The restaurant itself felt a little bit weird since it's basically in a converted house.
Plates are priced high, but if your looking for this type of food experience it is worth it.< /review>

I had reservations for dinner with my wife for Valentine's day. I thought everything would be fine since we had a table reserved but when we arrived it was so packed there was a line out the door and no one was even checking for reservations. We waited a while but decided to just leave instead and go somewhere else because of the wait. I still want to try the spot... the food smelled great and the atmosphere was intimate. I just hope whoever is in charge of reservations next time takes them more seriously and doesn't overbook or over seat the restaurant.</Text>

<Text>A very unique menu. Both food and service were top notch. No wait for the table. The wait staff were knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing. And the food was remarkable. The lamb is amazing. The lobster appetizer is phenomenal.

I had dinner here last night with four dear friends. Three of us were treating a lovely couple (Evan and Fran) to a thank-you dinner for hosting us refugees from fire evacuations in Oak Park and Thousand Oaks. What a treat to share a delectable meal with good friends! The restaurant's atmosphere is charming, the service divine, and the food sumptuous. I had the special lobster ravioli, and at $22, it was worth every bite. Best lobster ravioli I've had in my life. The five of us shared three desserts: two Zack's Pies and the bread budding. Not a bite left on anyone plate: salad, entrees, dessert . . . devoured. Will return!< /Review>

Someone else paid for the burger which always makes food taste better. But even if I had to pay for it myself, it was really good! Kobe Beef I believe. I'd go back for another one.< /text>

Had our Anniversary lunch here and I had a burger that was beyond excellent with a Ceasar salad that was crisp and refreshing.  This little spot on Thompson has delicious menu items, for lunch or dinner.  I'll be back for both.</Text>

<review>A hidden little gem in Ventura. It's my favorite "date night" restaurant. If we go early enough they always get us in without a reservation. Seasoning is always perfect and the sauces are fantastic. Its cliche, but I always order the peppercorn filet which in my opinion is the best in Ventura. My wife gets the pork tenderloin and she just loves it. If there was one downside I'd say it's a little pricey but you get what you pay for.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Service food and ambiance good. Only detractors were small size of chicken in the piccatta and tiny size of creme brulee. Food and presentation top notch. Corn, lobster appetizer was truly amazing. Gonna have to try and recreate that at home.  Adjust portions as mentioned and five stars.<//review>

Went there on a Saturday night and tried the duck + fig sausage, it was very yummy.  The guy working there was friendly and recommended the chutney, grilled onions and dijon to go with it, it was great!  Perfect with a beer next door at Toranados.</review>

There were four of us that were desperately hungry late (9:00) on a Saturday evening.  We had called several restaurants and no one would serve us - in fact we were rather rudely spoken to by two places.  One restaurant actually pulled down their open sign as we were walking up to their door. Cafe Zack not only seated us when we arrived at 9:15 but served us a delicious meal and treated us very well.  We are not from Ventura, but would definitely eat here again if we returned.  Thank you Cafe Zack!<//Text>

Absolutely wonderful place to go for a lunch or a dinner or just coffee a cup of tea and dessert or glass of wine.
The menu it's extra ordinary!
They serve food like nobody around in town. And the service it's very efficient yet non-invasive which it's perfect if you want private time with you friends family or a loved one.
I am so looking forward to go back.< /Review>

<review>Do arrange: Thai tea Milli Crepe, Pandan Milli crepe, Mango Sticky Rice Bingsoo

I would state after one attempt this has turned out to be one of my most loved pastry puts in the Bay Area. It was swarmed on a Saturday night yet we fortunately had a booking so getting situated wasn't generally an issue. In case you're preparing, reserve the spot in the event that you can!

Our gathering requested 3 things and I truly appreciated every one of the 3. It was difficult to pick a most loved however on the off chance that I needed to propose one for an amateur, I think it'd be the Thai tea Milli crepe. The nourishment was great, the introduction was exceptionally decent, and had no issues with administration. Try to fill them in as to whether anybody in your gathering has a birthday as the staff will give them a little treat with an upbeat birthday tune! I can hardly wait to return to attempt alternate things on their menu.< /review>< rate>

Yet another great trip to Beach House Tacos! I think the $4 salmon tacos have even grown in size! These tacos with a generous portion of grilled salmon, jicama, zucchini and sauce are scrumptious. The service is really friendly, and the food tastes fresh and delicious.< /review>

This place is the best. We have gone to Cafe Zack for two special occasions. We had great service both times. It gets busy in there but it never negatively affected our service.

The first time, I had the Halibut special, it was AMAZING. Our server told us that he thinks that they have 'the best filet mignon in the county,' so my boyfriend tried that. HE WAS NOT KIDDING, it was so good. The next time we came, we both ordered that. I was the best filet mignon I've ever had. Order it with the peppercorn sauce. You will not be disappointed!</Text>

Unfortunately my last visit there was very disappointing.Not only were we seated an hour late after our reservation but the meal was substandard. My girlfriend had the seafood dish. Half the shellfish were bad. I ordered steak that was hard to cut with the flimsy little knife that they gave me. And the side dish was some little potatoes and zucchini with no seasoning. I don't know I guess everybody's entitled to a bad night. But I would think some kind of a discount or at least an apology would be offered after a night like that in a restaurant that used to be great.<//Review>< Pictures>

It is what I called an "Internet Adventure" week end. I wanted to spend the night in Ventura to be close to our Sunday's event in Camarillo. We stayed at the Inn On The Beach, I already wrote a review on it. Cafe Zack is the second part of the adventure. According to my online research, it was one of the closest restaurant that didn't look like a steak house, a chain restaurant or a sushi place. The menu sounded nice, the ambiance romantic.
I was very disappointed. The place looks like it is in somebody's garage, which, actually, it is... I even wondered (and asked) if I came in by the right door. That was it for the romantic aspect of it... The food is OK. I cannot really complain about it. I ate everything I ordered, it was good but not great. The wine was OK too. The reason I didn't leave the place at first glance is because the staff was very nice, our waiter Alphonso was super friendly and did his very best to please us.
The Late Harvest Viognier dessert wine we got at the end of the dinner saved it all, it is a delicacy. This is the only thing I will recommend. I would not go back, certainly not but I cannot say it was a bad experience either. My partner and I made the best of it and we laughed a lot. Glad we have such great sense of humor!
I give it a 3 stars for the same reason than the hotel, it's right in the middle!<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I love the fact that they can shred smaller quantities, minimum a shopping bag full. You can watch them shred your papers but because of the pandemic, you are not allowed to get close to the machine but at least can watch from a short distance. The staff is really nice. I have been there once and have referred my friend. She also had a great experience. Prices are super reasonable.<//text>< pictures>

LOVE this place... so convenient and economical.  Got a quote in SF for $195... same job I was able to shred here for $36.  The $159 difference was worth the 20min drive over the bridge.  Highly recommended!!  (just be aware that they close early at 3PM!)</Text>

It costed me only $4.00, the guy shredded the documents right away and I can see the process. This gives me a piece of mind as I know for sure that the documents got shredded. Very inexpensive and excellent service!!<//Review>< pics>

I called them up and they let me know my mother had a credit and I also told them I had 3 additional trash bags and a basket we were using. They were sorry to hear about my loss that they said they would take it all at no additional charge. Now THAT'S service! I went back a few days later and took an additional bag of shred for my aunt and myself; $8.00 for a huge trash bag is much better than going to Office Depot.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Brought old hard drives, floppy disks and paper to shred. Fast friendly service at this store.

The nice thing is they shred the items while you watch. So you get to see the hard drives get crushed into little tiny pieces before your eyes. Prices are reasonable for the great service. 👍👍👍👍👍</Text>

My office usually does an annual shredding (for the past 30 years), and I have had tried many different shredding companies. This one is simply the best. They are Fast Friendly and at a super decent price. Ever since i discovered this place a few years ago, I have never gone to another place.< /Text>

<Text>We have been using Automated Response for well over 14 years. They are easy to work with. We just drop off our shredding at their place and they do the rest. If it's a smaller amount we can actually watch them do the shredding. Friendly customer service. Prices are reasonable.

I shredd about 4-5 times per year.  I disagreed with the rate increase because I felt it was unfair to go up on a customer more than 100% and advised her it would've been right to increase me overtime rather than charge me like that without notice.   Two times after that I went and paid my previous rate of $6 and once $7; with moving my business I visited more frequently.  The last two times that I went to have items shredded I encountered the same unfriendly lady who advised me that my rates are higher and it wasn't until another customer came into the area where she was speaking to me that she changed her tone to talk more nicely.  I terminated my services with this establishment.  Customers know that you can visit here and start here with friendly service and one price and at any given point they can increase your fees and then challenge you when you're upset about it .< /Review>< Rate>

Doctor is very nice and is very to the point and explained everything great. The one lady at the actual sleep study was rude to me and my ride/helper at the door. The place was clean, very nice and comfortable. I would recommend this place.</Text>

Dr. Kass is the best doctor he explains everything thoroughly and makes sure everything that we talked I understand clearly and makes sense to me. Thank you so much and I would recommend him to anyone with a sleeping disorder.</Text>

<text>This place handles all your sleep needs for a good night of rest, so if you feeling restless and no energy for the day, than come on down and get checked. Because there is nothing better than having a good nights of rest to take on your daily tasks.< /text>< user_id>

Takes them forever to get back to your results. Just today I had an appointment But I’ve been waiting forever for and the doctor ended up not being in today and there was no other doctors that I could talk to. All the workers are nice I’ve never really had any issues but the doctors are awful. They hardly ever answer the phone. Takes forever to get in contact with someone. For the zoom calls they don’t call you or remind you before hand. They didn’t call me and let me know that my appointment was canceled. I had to call them. Would not recommend this place,</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

While I don't like that I have apnea the process was painless and I could do it in my sleep 😁. My tech was very friendly for the test and Dr is very helpful and informative.<//Text>

This place has the WORST receptionists. All the ladies are unhelpful, rude and none of them are on the same page. Also, to be left standing outside due to covid and then asked in for payment is the rudest service ever. If I can be temp tested to come in for payment, I could be temp tested to come in to have my questions answered instead of waiting for caterpillar eyelashes to run back and forth inside to have my questions answered. 😡<//Text>

<Review>My experience with the staff and the Dr. have always been exceptional! I really thought use of this unit was going to be something I'd never get accustomed to, now I would never want to do without it. If you have someone in your life that has dealt with a bear in bed, she'll love it, not to mention, it is a life saver!<//Review>< pics>

I have been a patient for over 10 years. Dr. Kalra is outstanding, however the office staff is subpar. A few days ago I tried calling the office to change my appointment scheduled for June due to the fact that I will be out of town. The office did not return my call. I feel that I am being courteous, so I expect the same in return. None of my other medical offices provide such poor service. As a long time client, I think I should expect better treatment by the office staff.<//Review>

<Text>First of all , I noticed on my first conversation with the staff in regards to my appointment, the person who took my appointment was very rude and when I found out that they have a another location in Stockton , I ask her if i can change it to Stockton office since I worked in downtown Stockton so it would be more convenient for since it is my consultation. She just told me that I already had an appointment with them in Tracy.  Yesterday , I found out that I have another appointment that day and I tried calling them since 8:30am until now its 9:52 am and still getting a voice message .... I would not recommend this place for Veterans at all. I am very disappointed and I will let TRI -WEST that this place is not good referral for veterans. Still not able to talk to a live person in regards to my appointment . My C& P exam is more important for me as I am a Disabled Veteran.

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>I just went into Pacific sleep disorder for my sleep study tonight. I was not able to sleep at all for the following reasons:

1. The memory foam mattress was too stiff.
2. The pillows were too stiff.
3. They had the air conditioner on and the cold air would continuously hit my face. My sinuses got dry and irritated and I could not breathe well. It was 40 degrees outside, I still use the heater in my house because the weather is still cold. I asked the staff to turn the air conditioner off if they could and they said they could not turn it off. They gave me a surgical face mask to help but it didn't. It felt like it was around 60 to 65 degrees in my room.  It was very uncomfortable.

The lady that helped me was very friendly though but I am still giving the establishment a 1 star because it is almost if not impossible to sleep on one of their beds unless you have not slept in days. I was not able to get diagnosed with sleep apnea meaning I am still screwed and don't get good sleep when I do sleep at home because I won't get approved for any medical treatment yet. This is so frustrating. Oh, and to make an appointment it is such a pain in the neck. The staff is not very helpful. I had to call them three times and my doctor twice just to get them to schedule me in for a sleep study. Most horrible experience.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>
{'time': 1518463811300, 'text': 'Sergio, we are sorry that you had problems with your sleep testing.  We understand that when people sleep in an unfamiliar place and bed, it can be difficult to fall asleep. Our beds are memory foam and are relatively new.  We have not had any complaints about their comfort previously.  As for the temperature in your room, I am addressing this issue with our technicians and administrative staff to find out why this happened.  We will be in touch soon.  We do offer in-home testing.  Ask your doctor if he would order an in-home test, it might make you feel more comfortable and able to sleep better in order for us to get optimal results.  Anything we can do for you, please let us know.  Thank you for your comments and honesty.  We strive to be the best we can be and take these comments very seriously.'}< /Response>

Worst establishment ever. Not only someone forgot to order a cpap machine on my last appt...they sent me to Tracy office on email to go to instead of Stockton where I live. My appt next week supposed to report of my usage but since no one ordered the machine....another waste of my time. Not sure why the VA uses them. Poor service. Glad they don’t treat cancer I would be dead by now !</review>

<review>The employee, Vanessa, that works there is the absolute WORST employee that lives on earth! It takes her FOREVER to fax documents, even after repeated inquiries! I had an appointment. on July 2, and ONLY yesterday (8/23/18) did she fax over a required document to my insurance carrier! She said that it was only 2 weeks late! Wow, even still, why does it take you 2 weeks to fax a document? And if that was the first occurrence, I'd probably just overlook it (as I did the first time), but this seems to be the norm for her! Just pure lazy inefficiency! If Dr. Kass wasn't as good a doctor as he is, I'd give this place only 1 star!<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80900ce0cadd3c23:0x1c6c4f2fc845aaa</GmapID></record>

We have been living in Nantucket Apartments for 2 years. Every time that something breaks or something needs to be fixed, the staff comes quickly or within 24 hours of notifying.  Jose, the Nantucket handyman is a very nice and professional man. He fixes everything in no time!
We read a lot of reviews before signing our contracts here and by far we have been so happy with the service that we have been receiving.<//Text>

<review>Horrible customer service. I'm not sure if they screen phone calls or not, but I've been trying to get a hold of someone in the office since Monday August, 24, 2020. With a property with so many units, you would think someone would be available to answer the phone. Does the property manager even work? Is there an assistant to cover when there is no manager on duty? Do they even have a leasing agent? The office hours show they close at 6 pm, and I've called during office hours. How would their Regional Manager or Vice President of the company feel about how Nantucket is screening phone calls. I hope this review is read by Brenda Barrett, Mike Stamper and Dana Murrah. Yes, I did my research on the property and its ownership. They need proper training to manage a property.</review><user_id>116386597686002582490< /user_id><GmapID>0x808fc9a561449e39:0xc0377e1f3ff54e1d<//GmapID>< rate>

Pros:
Pretty landscaping and pool area. Quiet and safe. 10 min walk to Safeway and Guadalupe Trail is right across the road with a nature reserve and park next door.
The maintenance crew are always responsive and pleasant.
Cons:
Since the new management took over last year we have had numerous requests of contractors to enter on the wrong dates or the letter comes after they’ve already entered without our knowledge. Our bikes have gone missing and no one responds to our emails, each time we go to the office on the weekend, as it is only open on the weekdays from 9-5, it is always unattended with their return always over an hour later. Their automated rental payment system doesn’t allow for the varying invoice amount to include the monthly water bill so we have to pay it manually. If you are 3 days late, you get an eviction threat posted on your door, an email would suffice considering we’d never missed a payment in over 18 months.
The icing on the cake was the rude letter stating they had taken a photo of our balcony because we have lights up. See photo of offensive balcony.
Quite ridiculous, wouldn’t you want people to make it feel more like home so that we stay longer.< /Text>< user_name>

I remember first looking for a place to rent in Santa Clara, and we felt overwhelmed by how all of the nearby apartments seemed crammed and busy. Nantucket was a pleasant relief and was an easy choice. We really enjoyed our time here. If we could pick up the apartment and move it to our new location we would love to. The apartments are well designed. The grounds well maintained. We felt very safe. Highly recommend this place. The management is also great.

Lived here for the past 3 years and nothing to say but good things about this complex! Annual renewal rates were very attractable! The maintenance team at Nantucket has been the best - they stand by their commitment to fix issues within a 48 hour time frame. As for parking - not an issue! There's always parking available at any time of the day. The pool section is nice and upgraded with the new gas grills + tables/chairs. I would recommend this community to anyone that wants to live in Santa Clara near Levi's Stadium!<//Text>

Move-in process was super easy, was able to do everything online. Leasing agent Dakota was super helpful and responsive. Great location, close to all necessities, some apartments have fantastic views of the park and mountains like mine does. Central heat, in-unit washer dryer and reasonably priced!<//Review>

<Review>My parents truly love this community because the environment here is beautiful, well kept and peaceful, as well as greenery view of the park in neighbor. What I really like is the room layout and complete/updated in-room facilities. Dakota from management team always greets my family with a smile and is very helpful to our needs, I have loved my time here and will always recommend it to others.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>We have been living here for nearly 2 years.
Pros:
Pretty landscaping and pool area. Quiet and safe. 10 min walk to Safeway and Guadalupe Trail is right across the road with a nature reserve and park next door.
The maintenance crew are always responsive and pleasant.
Cons:
Since the new management took over last year we have had numerous requests of contractors to enter on the wrong dates or the letter comes after they’ve already entered without our knowledge. Our bikes have gone missing and no one responds to our emails, each time we go to the office on the weekend, as it is only open on the weekdays from 9-5, it is always unattended with their return always over an hour later. Their automated rental payment system doesn’t allow for the varying invoice amount to include the monthly water bill so we have to pay it manually. If you are 3 days late, you get an eviction threat posted on your door, an email would suffice considering we’d never missed a payment in over 18 months.
The icing on the cake was the rude letter stating they had taken a photo of our balcony because we have lights up. See photo of offensive balcony.
Quite ridiculous, wouldn’t you want people to make it feel more like home so that we stay longer.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnSRoIFiMrBu80HJd9ZMmJOhw4JejX4lMgyoCS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOhoz-XoiLTfp7ijEh_MS7aaqmyvxdBavn3Cep=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

First of all i want to explain that in order for me to write a review, the service/product needs to be exceptional or below average. In this case the service was exceptional. Above and beyond. Was in the process of moving to a new location with only a few days left in my schedule to decide and Jenly Lam, exceeded my expectations. This was my 18th property i viewed in 5 days so you can imagine the stress/anxiety. Need to move in now but don't want to settle. None of the previous 17 Leasing Consultants knew about the units as well as Jenly Lam did. When you're moving, the process is very stressful. I explained what I needed in the unit including a view since i was scheduled to work from home all day ever day. Jenly Lam was the only consultant that was excited about the unit as i was because she understood what i was looking for. She saw my vision. The previous 17 lease consultants had very little energy, just going through the motions. This position is a sales position. Therefore should be treated as such. Understand what the client is looking for and find either the right unit or something close to it. Tell them why it would fit their needs. Why would a potential tenant move into your complex opposed to 1000s of other units with similar amenities and? It's their attention to detail. When i left the viewing, I had 5 other properties to view but after driving out the driveway, i realized Nantucket was the ideal complex with the perfect unit i needed.  I immediately drove right back and started the process. Jenly helped me every step of the approval process, communicated effectively and got me approved in less than 24 hours!!!!!   I do have to mention that if it wasn't for Jenly, I would not have moved here. The other consultants are ok but they're a dime a dozen including the other consultants at Nantucket. Wasn't sure if i was calling the leasing office or the doctor's office. I had to do a double take. In the sales world, you have to stand out and care or at least pretend to care or this isn't for you. I was recently informed that Jenly may no longer be part of the Nantucket team. It's unfortunate but hope she finds bigger and better opportunities as I'm sure she will. She will definitely be a valuable asset to any team she joins. Thank you Jenly Lam for helping me realize this was the perfect unit!!!!</text>

<Text>This among the few community that we have truly loved staying at. The management and maintenance folks are great - very helpful. No complaints whatsoever.

We had a water issue once in the night at 10:00pm. The maintenance folks were over almost immediately to help us.

The houses are great. Lick Mill park nearby is a wonderful. The Ulistac Natural Area have some events showing wild flowers and forest restoration.

I would highly recommend this place if looking in the area.</Text>< response>

My granddaughter lives here and is in love with the complex. She’s never had a single complaint! On numerous occasions Jose has helped me (a visitor) with carrying my vacation bags up the stairs. Leasing Office and Maintenance staff are amazing, I’d say they definitely have a solid team! My granddaughter says it’s a great place to live & close to everything.

Best apartments in Santa Clara, hands down! The way it is built is awesome, open landscaping, many residents walk around the property inside the gates, 250+ apartments, 350+ trees! Gorgeous, situated right next to the park and across from Ulistac, it's tucked away and feels like you're far from the city.</Text>

Lived here during 2019. Overall a pleasant experience--moved for need of elevators. Would have strongly considered staying otherwise.

- Location: 5/5. Situated right next to Lick Mill Park, which is a nice place to go on walks. Close enough to the VTA station for commuting. Close to Safeway and Target.
- Building Features: 4/5. Good overall. Does not have elevators for those living above first floor. Most units are all-carpet.
- Maintenance: 4/5. Building is kept clean-looking. Leaves on sidewalk are regularly cleared. Trash collection area is regularly emptied, but there were a couple of instances when they looked overfilled.
- Amenties: 4/5. Pool with Spa, Two grills in pool area side by side, Gym, Game Room with Pool Table. Couldn't figure out how to get access to the Game Room after locks were replaced with app-based access. Package Locker feature is available as an option.
- Management: 5/5. Every communication with management was pleasant. Maintenance staff is one of the friendliest I've ever experienced.<//text>

<review>Management is rude and inconsiderate.

We were "REQUIRED" to move everything out of our storage closet multiple times within a span of 3 months to minor maintenance.

Maintenance accidentally let our dog out did not inform us.  We were contacted by a neighbor.

One of the contractors that the property routinely uses entered our property without consent or notice. Management did not do anything to make sure this would never happen again.

Property manager was annoyed that the phone rang to many times when I called in to ask a question.

Pool was closed in October 2017 and was told that it would reopen in November 2017.  It is now April 2018. Spoke directly to leasing office, as suggested, for an update and no info was offered.

Property management is incredibly slow to fix things that they are not legally obligated to take care of, this include all amenities. Leasing office was me that amenities are not included in my rent so they aren’t financially inclined to fix them.

Remote access to main entry gates has be broken for since late April and repairs are still pending as of 6/20.  Reached out the leasing office and was told that no repair action has been approved.

A non working fireplace was added to the pool area.

Contacting the leasing office will do nothing to help your experience a positive one!

Could not deal with management anymore and decided to move out.  Thoroughly clean the apartment and was still charged excessive cleaning fees.

Management has not yet returned my security deposit as required CA civil code.</review><user_name>Holt Bui< /user_name>< date>

I had a plan to move into a flat in this community around April 2017, I had paid the Security deposit, holding deposit etc what ever was necessary to hold that apartment for my Move-in , according to the leasing office staff member. Suddenly, 5days before my date of Move-in, I Email them inquiring about the move-in process and they tell me that This apartment is not available for move-in as the current tenants are not vacating the place." I mean, seriously? Would you not even care to inform me about this until I call you back for something? That is really not my problem if the tenant is not vacating!! "
Also, I have asked them to look for another apartment in the same community for the coming months or for a backup for this, they could not help. In fact  , they did not even mind to respond to me properly. They wouldn't even apologize for what they did and ignore my calls.
Very disappointed with the staff working here.
I hope they realize this is not the way they should deal with people interested in renting a home in their community and I wish this never really happens to anyone else.
I would still recommend this community to anyone who would want to stay in a neat, peaceful neighborhood, but, Please check with them about everything before moving-in and constantly keep in touch with them until your move-in. You wouldn't like their surprises!< /review><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>It's a pretty quiet and comfortable neighborhood. Since it's a gated community filled with tech folks, everybody is pretty quiet at night during the weekdays.

When moving in, I had to rush my stuff here since I took a new job. The community adjusted to my schedule and sped my onboarding process so I could have an apartment. That meant a lot. This complex took the extra mile and that sold me on moving in here. They were prompt and fair with the process and it showed me that they cared and would work with me. That flexibility is key.

The staff - from the leasing manager to maintenance workers - are all friendly and super delightful. The community is diverse. The kids getting a little loud on the weekends but who didn't get excited for Saturday morning cartoons??<//review><Response>{'time': 1550688312587, 'text': "Malik, thank you for taking the time to rate us five stars!

We have lived here for three months now and have nothing but good experiences with the office staff, maintenance and repair people.  We are very happy to be living in such a pretty complex. We enjoy taking our little dog for walks in the nearby parks. It is a quiet complex for the size. The owners have made great efforts in improving the common areas, including pool and gym. Being able to arrange non urgent repairs online is a great convenience.< /Review>

I have been living here for the past couple of years and all set to live for the next year as well. I have been to other apartments in the neighborhood but Nantucket stands out among all of them. Its very open, airy, well maintained and totally homely. Special shout out to two people. Breanna has been great, she is friendly and very prompt. Anthony is always ready to help for any maintenance issue. I am totally impressed by these two folks.

This property is very beautiful, the price was a little above my budget the agent who took me on a tour was very detailed and quick in response with all my questions. I mentioned to her of an incident that occurred at my previous apartment complex regarding my maintenance request, she assured me that this will not be an issue as they are very prompt in all repairs if needed. I am sad that the property was above mine and my roommates price point but I will be recommending this property to all my other fellow friends,family and coworkers solely on the outstanding agent who happens to also be the Assistant Manager Breanna.< /review>

Please know, we always follow ethical business practices and all terms as outlined in the lease agreement.

<rating>1< /rating><review>I've never had an apartment complex work so hard at making me feel less at home. The management is clearly more concerned with gaining new residents than maintaining their current ones. The leasing office was so nice and responsive when I was looking at the apartment, but all that changed once I moved in. The women who work at the front desk are some of the rudest and most unpleasant people with whom I've ever had the misfortune of dealing. Every time I walked into the office, one of them would just look at me and say "what do you need?" No smile, no "how are you?," no pleasantries at all. They were even rude to my guests who came to visit. Often, there wouldn't even be anybody in the office, and one time, my boyfriend, who had just driven 5 hours from LA, had to wait for almost two hours for someone to get him the key I had left at the desk. When the lady finally came back from "lunch," she ended up calling me at work to yell at me because I had sent a message about the key to the main office email address instead of her address even though I had spoken to her about the key in person earlier that morning and had left it in an envelope with all the information written on it.

On top of that, there was an "annual inspection" or some other excuse for them to enter everyone's apartments at least once a month. During these "inspections," they would make you clean out the storage closet on your balcony and remove your pets from your unit. Several times after I had already made these arrangements for the day, I would come home to a notice that they had to reschedule for some reason. I also came home one day to find my living room furniture completely rearranged because they had to move something onto the balcony without giving me prior warning and didn't even have the decency to leave my apartment the way they had found it.

The apartments themselves are nice enough, but the equipment in the gym is old and constantly breaking and the pool is never clean. There were also several incidents of people's cars being broken into while I was there. The gate to enter the complex also blew down on a windy day, so I'm not sure what that says about the security system.

When my tenancy in hell was finally coming to an end because I was moving to a new city, I tried to work with the front office in scheduling my move out date, but they were completely unreasonable. They said they would charge me a $500 fee plus the prorated amount if I stayed even one day past the date my lease ended. I've lived in many apartments over the years, and they all were very willing to work with me on my move out date and charge a reasonable amount for any time spent past the lease end-date. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised given the way I had been treated over the year at Nantucket.

Overall, if you're going to spend the amount of money these apartments cost, you're better off finding a place where the management treats residents with common decency and respect, and somewhere you can actually come to call "home."< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>This is ABSOLUTELY NOT A SECURE PLACE TO LIVE!

My friend's car got broken into DURING THE DAY in the parking lots of the apartment! Please see the picture in the gallery.

Three issues with security:

1. The two gates closes so slowly that any car can tailgate a authorized car and sneak into the community.

2. I have talked to several guys who lived here for more than 3 years and they said the gates won't close now and then. I just moved into the apartment for one month and I have already seen this happened and the gate didn't get repaired for 3 days, now it's still open:-( That means any burglar can enter into the community easily.

3. There's no security camera inside the community, even the two gates don't have security cameras right in front of them, which means if any burglary happens no useful info will be provided to the police, and the burglars will probably come back again.

To the ones who plan to move in:

You will pay a crazy amount of money for the monthly payment, and you don't even get enough security for your home and your car? What the hell is that? Before you sign the lease, please make sure you check if security camera are installed inside the community and if the tailgating problem is fixed BY YOURSELF.< /Review>< date>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><userid>101067659539596102677</userid><text>Do not rent here! This place is way OVERPRICED! For $$$ you pay, you get old apartments with old appliances. They advertised their apartments as newly renovated, but apart from repainting kitchen cabinets and walls everything else is old, including basic appliances like washer and dryer and dishwasher. This is the 4th day since our dishwasher doesn't work. I have submitted request for repair  and electrician came same day, spend 10 minutes on repair and told me it works again. When I wanted to restart dishwasher it was broken again. I have notified them right away, submitted new repair request but 3 days later we still don't have functioning dishwasher. Me and my husband talk to management representatives couple of times, and they told us that their repair policy is 48 hours and even that is just for emergency repairs, that their technicians have other repairs to do on the property ( that probably means that a lot of things are rotten around here) and when the time comes they will take care of it. Since we last spoke with them 2 days ago, nobody follow up by phone or email to let us know when the dishwasher will be either fixed or replaced . If you don't want to feel like you are eating at Taco Bell and paying like you are in Michelin star restaurant, save yourself a head ache and find some other place to live. This place maybe used to be cheaper than the other apartments in the area, but not anymore, so  find yourself some newer apartment with (hopefully) newer appliances that work.<//text><date>1476386950429<//date>< rating>

I love this place. My family and I have settled in here, and were going on 5 months now.  The complex is peaceful and clean!!  The neighborhood is amazing too (beautiful).  I was concerned about the elementry school that is zoned for this complex, but i have even enjoyed that.  I love the teachers and the after school program.  The down side is that this place is pricy, but so is everything else in the neighborhood.  I'm definintley going to be sad when it is time for us to leave.<//review>

Hidden charges:
They have hidden charges besides the rent. I was told that my rent would be 2500. But, what I actually pay is way more than that. They say that since the management change, I have to pay an extra 50$ every month. The worst part is only a few of the new tenants pay this fees. The weird logic that the give is .. all tenants that have moved in or after Feb have to pay this fees. Moreover, the rent doesnot include anything.... no sewer .. no garbage ... nothing. So, be sure that your utilities would be $150 atleast. Plus PGNE : $75  Plus SVE : $75 ... Which would total to $300 every month.</Text>

Cris's dedication to exemplary customer service and taking ownership of a challenge from start to finish, keep me coming back.  The prices are more than reasonable for repairs, the location is super convenient, and the big o brand tires are on par or better than big brand products.  Their tires have saved me several times from my own stupidity.  I've worked with other mechanics that royally destroyed my truck but big o is reliable and trustworthy.  They will always have my business and I don't think twice about referring friends and clients to them.< /Review><userid>104858511441710704760< /userid><Time>1604676205073< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Be aware off there inspection report .I came hear for the alignment after the work got done they did a free inspection, they recomended that I change my back brakes and resurface or replace the rotors and the xtra work will cost over 600$ I told them that my car was not to old to require new rotors they insisted so I said I will get back to them so , I took my car the next day to the Honda dealer for a inspection, I told the manager what big o tires had recommended, after Honda did the inspection Honda advise that my rodors were in good condition my car only need brake pads , and after comparing  reports find out that others work that big o tires recommended was not needed.< /text>

They say you measure service with how you perform when no one is looking.  I will take that further and say, you measure service when you are not at the register buying..  I have been buying tires exclusively for all of my cars over the years at Big O San Ramon based on their great service, integrity and pricing.  This past week I got a flat on the Grapevine headed to LA.   Not ideal but even less than ideal with a sports suv and a 22” wheel.  As we were stuck trying to find a new tire with no luck, it came to mind to call Chris in San Ramon.  Not only did he pick up, but he gave us advice on a temporary solution to get us to LA and then advice on getting new tires while in LA.  Our trip was salvaged and were are back home safely.  Needless to say, I will continue buying tires and using Big O San Ramon exclusively(as possible) :).  Thank you Chris and Big O San Ramon!</Review>

<Review>My main concern when taking my car in for service has always been Trust. I've had my cars serviced by many different mechanics in the past and I have been ripped off so many times. Big O Tires San Ramon is the only place I will take my car. I've been going to them for over 10 years and never ever have they tried to rip me off. my boss and his family now use them exclusively. Plus they are very fair on pricing and they will actually tell you that you don't need service. In other words they will turn away service if it's not needed which is absolutely amazing. I wish I could take them with me when I leave the state next year.<//Review>< Pictures>

There are several reasons that this store has my business and loyalty. The straight forward honest approach of every person I have ever spoken with, the fast service results (typically ahead of the estimated time), and the information on what should be considered, and what is not really needed to be done at that time. Although I have only needed to visit another store location away from the area for alignment check, it was at no charge. So the number of locations is also a benefit. However, as I mentioned previously, I always come to this San Ramon location for all services they offer on all our cars (5 at the moment).< /review>

<text>Chris from this store just came and picked up my dad's car, drove it to the shop, repaired his flat tire, and dropped it back at their house. My parents are holed up at home because they are both elderly and high risk for Corona, and my dad is terminally ill. Chris, you're an angel. Thank you so so much for helping my parents at this time. I so desperately wish I could visit and help them but I've had too much potential exposure and I am so grateful that people like you exist in the world to look out for them when I can't. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart ❤< /text><user_name>Elizabeth Riley Chiechi< /user_name>< pictures>

I had 4 new tires installed about 6 months ago. I noticed one tire was low and put more air in it at the gas station. It went low again the next day. I called to see about timing to have it looked at and was told it could be done in 45 minutes. I went down to the store immediately and it was repaired within 35 minutes at no charge. Now that is great service!!!!</Text>

• wire-brush your wheels thoroughly to avoid leak
• consider new sets of non-chrome wheels
• tire installation is just as important as tire quality.<//review><gmapID>0x808ff2e9e0b65ccd:0xe04cfcac99b8496a< /gmapID><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>I called to make an appointment for oil change 5 days before. It wasn’t clear it was first come first serve basis. Anyway a rep explained it was and eta was 2 hours. I waited and called in 2 hrs to  check the status. He said another 45 mins. I had to cancel due to other arrangement.
The thing is the rep was very rude on my cancellation and gave me a look. I know it’s busy day but this is not how they should treat customers. I have been using this store several times in the past. Not sure what happened but it was not the same experience I had before.<//text>< GmapID>

<Text>I had two tires replaced and all four wheels aligned. During this three out of four of my cars alloy wheels were damaged. I know this happened at the store as i was the car 48 hours before and hadn't driven it since due to the lock down. The shop took responsibility for two of the damaged wheels but not the third.

Getting my car serviced at Big O was one of the best experiences I've had with my car. I had my car at Costco across the street getting a tire fixed (since it was under warranty there) and they had an issue getting the lug nuts off. Costco said Big O could fix the lug nut issue, and then I could bring my car back to to replace the tire. I had meetings all day long and could not leave work (down the road at Bishop Ranch) - so I prayed and called Big O asking if they wouldn't mind getting my car from Costco, fixing the lug nuts, and then returning it to Costco. I was not an existing customer, and they ended up doing this for me all over the phone. Best service ever and they saved the day for me. I had a razor in my tire and HAD to get it fixed before I drove home - but was unable to leave work early. The guys here were the nicest and were super honest. I ended up getting my next oil change with them as a thank you for the extra mile they went for my tires, and that went just as smooth. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for that local, honest car mechanic. :) They seriously saved my butt!< /Text>

I went here because I had a nail in my tire. Not only did they not try to sell me a new tire, I knew mine could be fixed. They repaired my tire at no cost. Just to be nice! Also helped point me in the right direction for a few things I need done on my car. Best experience I have ever had at a mechanic shop! Always going here. Lifetime customer.< /text>

<Text>TOUpon returning to my car, I found almost evry item that was in my middle console strewn across my front passenger and driver seat floor. They were looking for my wheel key, but never thought about calling me or asking for it before I left for lunch. The techs responsible, Bernardo Zepeda & Alejandro Nino treated me terribly, NEVER apologising. I was OFFENDED!! Owner said he would speak with them. I requested to speak with Owner, only to find out I was speaking with him. He apologized, but made no accommodations to "fix" the damage done to me. TERRIBLE service!!!</Text>< pics>

I originally thought Big O were for offroad trucks n such... good thing I finally made the plunge and went in.

First I brought in my wife's vehicle for full brake rotors and pad swap with new brake fluid. Significantly cheaper than the dealership while utilizing the same OEM parts.

Next, I brought in my vehicle for a nail in the tire.Done professionally, done right.

Thx Big O!👌<//Review>

They don't charge for tire rotation and brake inspection.
Prices OK. Staff seems to be honest.
Have been a regular customer.
They would generally try to sell Big O brand tires vs other brands. Which is understandable.< /Text>

<Text>Went in due to flat tire. They took my car in to repair it and I was shuttled to work. I kept getting calls from them asking for more money because "this" is wrong and "that" needs to be fixed, calling me every so often. They wanted $400, in the end. All this because I had a flat tire.

<pics>None</pics><review>Very rude customer service. Had to deal with a guy called 'Chris' who checked me in and told me it would take an hour and a half for an oil change. He then told me it was okay to bring the car back in an hour since they would not even start with my vehicle till then. The deal was that I bring the car back in an hour and they do the oil change in 30 minutes. Guess what?? When I bring in the car in 50 minutes, he tells me it will take 2 hours more since they skipped my position in the queue. RIDICULOUS!!!
Very rude and sarcastic when I tried reasoning with the employees. Will never be going back and strongly recommend that folks who value their time never go to Big O tires San Ramon!!</review>< Time>

So I went in here today for a flat repair, the clerk says that would take 2-3 hrs for something that takes 10 mins to do. I was considering buying new tires as well but oh well guess I will take my money elsewhere. By the way thanks Big O for letting me drive off with an unsafe tire :-/< /text>

Great little Shop and dealt with the Owner Lawrence. He and his staff are very customer focused and very welcoming. Everyone is important that I observed. Best most of all. Honesty. If you have vintage video games and systems go see them. I will be back to continue business with VGG.</text>

I love this place. They have everything you would want or need. The inventory changes so you never know what you're going to find. By far my favorite retro video game store. The owner is super helpful and having a dog there a few times when I went in was just an added bonus!< /review>

I haven't made it down the the store yet, but I did call in with some questions. They worker (assuming the owner) was super helpful and isn't a scam artist like a lot of the other hole in the wall video game places are. Go down there and check it out!

EDIT: Went down there and they were super cool and helpful! Not on the pricey side and was able to get a classic system with no hassle.< /Review>

I loved this place, it’s now my favorite video game store. Now, As for the people that think that this place is overpriced and that GameStop is cheaper, it’s actually not. This store sells an N64 for example, at 70.00$ while it is a little pricey, it’s actually a way better deal than GameStop which retails it at 90.00 dollars meaning you’d save 20 dollars!</Review>

Definitely a spot to check out. All of the games are well organized, and they have a really good selection. The staff is always great, they help me to pick out games I never heard of that I now love, and when I bought my N64 a few years ago the guy hooked it up with 2 free games and not the cheap kind either. Please support this awesome shop!</Text>

<text>They have lots of games from old to new . New games are most of the time cheaper then big stores and even game stop. The people who own the shop also run it and they have been gamers since childhood themselves. the can order and pre-order just like other places but at lower prices. They also clean and repair (as best they can ) game discs. They also buy your stuff if wanna sell.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>These guys are awesome. Incredibly knowledgeable, and one of the best retro game selections I've seen in SoCal. Very clean and bright store, and everything is clearly labeled. Definitely worth the drive all the way from Santa Monica. I will certainly be returning here soon!< /review>< pics>

The guy who was there on my first visit was super chill and a huge Zelda fan, which is awesome since that's my favorite game series of all time.  Had a decent selection from various consoles.  Will definitely be back soon.</text>

They have a large selection of games for game consoles at fair prices. No PC games.
My main gripe was when we entered the man said hello, but after 15 to 20 minutes, he had not made an effort to ask us if we needed help. My friend picked a game and he didn't even bother to ask us if we were ready to go. I made eye contact with the man, and he lowered his eyes. I had to initiate conversation with this man to get my questions answered, instead of him using his customer service to help a paying customer.

Also there was no music which was mildly umcomfortable.

Updating my review because they gave my friend the wrong disk for the game he purchased, when he went back they gave him another game to go with it as an apology. That was awesome of them.</Text>

I hate buying used games online, because I always end up getting something I wasn't expecting (rental stickers, permanent marker on the cartridge). This place has a great selection with a knowledgable staff. Prices are a little more than online, but you will know what you're  getting and you get to work with a great staff.<//Text>

<text>Having been to other used game stores and big bog stores for my gaming needs, I continued my search... Then I ran into Video Game Geeks..
A small, independent gaming store in the heart of Anaheim. I'm glad I found these guys because the place is clean, the staff is knowledgeable (and doesn't consist of neck beard nerds that will only argue or scoff at your purchases).

New games tend to be cheaper than chain stores and used/retro games come at a fair margin less than other stores around the neighborhood. My fave store...
Highly Recommended!</text><time>1367613245072<//time><UserId.>107574576659000352293< /UserId.>< username>

It gave me issues within a couple of weeks. It was scratching my games. I took it to them so they can fix it. Well i went to get it back 2 weeks later. Telling me i have to send it to Sony and refuse to do anything with it. When i got home the console was not put back together correctly, with broken tabs and a bunch of missing screws. What kind of crap is that. To top it off i called Sony about getting it repaired and they want $150 to fix it.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

The prices are too high. I have went to gamestop and have NEVER seen n64s at $70! I even checked their pokemon games and I checked gamestop online their Pokemon firered was 20-30 bucks but at VIDEO GAME GEEKS their 50 bucks. Anyone to who is reading this I reccomend ebay, gamestop, or Amazon just not this overpriced place...</review>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>Chinese Chicken salad. One half breast grilled, and seasoned well. Fresh spinach and other greens. Canned mandarin oranges and canned Chinese noodles.  Dressing not freshly made, but store bought. Overall, very mediocre. I love this spot in Clovis. Just wish the food was much better. Servers are very personable and helpful.< /Text>< gmapID>

Great place to work, great place to eat, great place to hangout.

Saturdays and Sundays are very busy, but if you're willing to venture out on the same day as everyone else and enjoy the company of whoever you're with... well let me tell you this is the place to be! Friendly service, friendly waitstaff, outstanding work ethic. Given these rough times and the younger generation not wanting to work, you will not find another local business with employees working harder than this restaurant.

Family owned, family oriented, family friendly place!</text>

Always prefer to give our business to Clovis and wanted to try Old town Cafe.  Pretty disappointing. Very slow service and very high prices. We had 2 lunches for $37. Part of that was $3.95 ice tea! Good part was a waiter named Justin, who was friendly, helpful and accommodating.<//Text>

<review>Old Town Cafe is even better than Sandy's! I come here all the time for lunch and breakfast. The outdoor is seating is very good, you can't beat sitting on Pollasky Ave in the morning. Their menu is simple, but perfect. Not an overwhelming menu. There are a couple items I would change (the breakfast burrito). Lunch is very good too. I always get either a Burger or the Philly Cheese Steak. The waitstaff is pretty good. There have been a few times I have gone and the waitress was rude, the rest of the waitstaff is very good and professional.  Overall, very good.</review></record></dataset><record>
< review>
Worst Mother’s Day breakfast ever, like ever. $25 for bacon, sub par hash browns and French toast(no champagne). Last time I went I was told the food that I had previously ordered wasn’t vegan, after being told by previous employees that it was, not sure what is true. I went back for my mom, but after she had to ask for a second piece of bacon from the buffet (again $25) we couldn’t help but laugh at how crazy our bill was for what we got, they only had scrambled eggs, no omelet station, no eggs Benedict, no beans, no salsa, no tortillas, one kind of fruit. Honestly Denny’s would have been better.</review>

<Review>I'm glad that Old Town Cafe was open.
Good food.  Friendly service. Disappointed in how long it took to get our food. 45 minutes.  The owner came to talk with us after our meal and explained that they were training 2 new cooks.<//Review><Rate>3< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

Seated, had drink order taken, drinks brought. Waited over 20 minutes for a server to come take our order, never happened. So we paid for the drinks and left. Really wanted to like this place, and support a local business, but I'll never go here again, nor will I recommend it. Edit to add, I'm appalled at the owners behavior and words replying to reviews. Extremely unprofessional.<//text>

I’m here for a quick visit to Clovis. Husband and I stopped in for some food. Not good today. Husband’s omelette was burnt on the ends and hash browns were too greasy to eat. Both of us got biscuits and gravy. Gravy was good, biscuits were solid rock. Service was good, waitress nice and friendly. Wouldn’t recommend to travelers.< /text>

Excellent service and food. The Philly cheese steak and the clam chowder soup were amazing. So great to see this open up in Old Town Clovis. Make sure to grab breakfast or lunch here when you do your shopping!< /Text>

Owned and operated by local Favorite Salsas Cantina around the corner, Old Town Cafe is a small place with good Old Town charm, and the food is excellent! I recommend the chicken fried steak very highly! The gravy is slightly sweet, just for reference, which I personally like but that's preference of course.<//Review>

There’s no kid’s menu and the pancakes are over-priced and disappointing. 6 bucks for two pancakes! And they were thin and sad. I got an eggs Benedict with artichoke and avocado which I was hopeful would be kinda exciting. But it was severely underwhelming. Very little hollandaise sauce meant the whole thing was dry. I just expected more and when I left, my kids were still hungry. Would not recommend.<//text>< Pictures>

<Time>1574270882354</Time><Review>Had a wonderfully delicious dinner with my wife. We both had the Pork Scallopini dinner (nightly special), which was absolutely fantastic. The food had lots of flavor and the service was outstanding. Overall, very good job!!

We will definately be back. We also had a nice conversation with Jacob Z. (Manager), who told us that they have only been open for about a month and a half for breakfast/lunch. Dinner has been served for about a week and a half. The Old Town Cafe has the same owner as Salsa's Restaurant (another great restaurant) here in Old Town Clovis. Give them a try!</Review>< Pictures>

<user_name>Susan Pegg< /user_name><text>I always enjoy my visit to this dentist.  Me and my family have been Dr Vic’s patients for over 10 years and we have not experienced anything we can complain about.  The staff are all so friendly,  They give everyone undivided attention.  Dr Vick’s practice has expanded over the years and there are 3-4 hygienists that work there as well.  No matter what type of work you have done Dr Vick makes sure he has also Reviews all work done by others.  So if you see someone else you still see him as well.  This is a family oriented practice and his wife works with him as well.  The office is very clean and he even serves coffee in the lobby.  He is an honest dentist and does not over charge.  So if you are looking around for a dentist I highly recommend this office.  He will even make arrangements to work extra if you have an emergency that can not wait and if he is on vacation he has another dentist that takes his patients so you never have to been in pain<//text><user_id>114186786415807721485<//user_id>< Resp>

Dr Vicken Marganian D.D.S. is one of the very best in all of Southern California! I live in Henderson NV., he was my dentist when I lived in Southern California. I travel from Nevada just because he's outstanding and the very best! His staff is amazing and wonderful!
I recommend him to all my friends and family, coworkers...< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Our family loves this dental office! Dr. Vick has been our dentist for over a decade. Dr. Vick made sure I had a beautiful, white smile for my wedding day, my husband became his patient, he cared for me during my pregnancies, he's seen all my babies for their 1st tooth, and continues to care for us all still. The level of care from the front desk to the exam rooms is top notch.

All the staff are very personable and caring. They feel like friends. I've recommended family to the office and will continue to do so.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Our whole family has been going to Dr. Marganian for more than 15 years.  We have, without fail, found him to be talented and thorough, and every member of his team to be friendly, caring, and professional.  Additionally, Dr. Marganian has completed all of our families oral surgical needs, including crowns and root canals with precision and excellence. I had the option of referral to an oral surgeon for my root canal but preferred to have someone we had immense confidence in do it, instead. He took very good care of me.
I am so thankful to call “Dr. Vick” our dentist</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Dr. Marganian is a skilled and talented dentist. In addition, everyone, and I mean everyone, who works there is helpful and cheerful. It makes you almost want to go to the dentist just to be with all those lovely people. Kidding aside, he is outstanding and is recognized as one of the best dentists in the area.<//Review>

The friendliness and customer service was outstanding. They made me feel comfortable before the procedure. The dental staff was professional and gave great care before and during the tooth extraction. Their kindness to me is greatly appreciated and I'm happy to say after living in LA for years, I have finally found a dentist Vicken Marganian DDS I feel comfortable with and will return to  for the continuation of my treatment.

A friend of mine recommended me to Dr. Marganian. She said he was the best! Not only the doctor was kind but also all the staff were very nice and friendly people.
I was having severe pain from my tooth and they were able to schedule me an appointment that same day!
Dr. Marganian provided me with a painless procedure and was explaining what he would do through out the process.
Was a great experience!</Text>

New to The area found a dentist that takes tricare, works with you on payment plans and I love that it's very family oriented doctor vicken had a good aim for injections before fillings didn't feel a thing. Not to mention the warm lavender towels at the end makes me feel like I'm at the spa.<//text>

Omg !! So many great things to say about them. I have been to four different dentist and had not found one I liked. Until I found Dr. Marganian!. Him and Savannah were amazing. Had a root canal and left with a smile I could not believe it. He injected my mouth to numb it and I didn't even feel it. On top of all that I found out they have been there for 20+years and that they are PHS alumni as well.  I finally found my dentist!! :)< /text>

Last month I was experiencing some tooth pain. I needed to see someone right away and because I recently moved to Southern California I did not have a dentist. I called a few recommendations but was unable to get someone to see me right away. I decided to google dentist near me and I found Dr. Marganian. I immediately called his office and a sweet lady answered. I asked to be seen that evening and to my surprise I was given an appointment for 5:30 on that evening. When I arrived I was immediately acknowledged by the front desk staff with a smile and a warm welcome. First impressions are always lasting impressions. I was given the paperwork to complete and without having to wait a long time Sevanna the dental assistant greeted me with warmth and invited me into the exam room. A few minutes later Dr. Marganian came in with his cheerful disposition and totally put me at ease. I was nervous because back in New York I went to the same dentist for many years and didn’t know what to expect. Both Sevanna and Dr. Marganian took such good care of me that I looked forward to my follow up appointments. Joe the dental hygienist is also amazing. The office is clean, inviting and best of all has an amazing staff. If you’re stuck in a rut like I was just give this office a call and you will be sure to have found a lifelong dentist. Thank you Dr. Marganian and staff.< /Text>

< review>
I’ve been going to Dr. Marganian for over 10 years and I have always left feeling happy with the quality of work and service I received. I recently had crowns put in for my front teeth and I am thoroughly pleased with my results. Dr. Marganian talked me through the process and types/colors of crowns, and I ended up with exactly what I wanted. It is always a painless process when working with Dr. Marganian!< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I like being reminded of my appointments and knowing the Dr. and staff are gentle and also efficient.  I moved away for a bit and and tried other dental offices but couldn't get the same friendly and professional treatment elsewhere. They weren't concerned of my well being and only reminded when the next payment was due...that other office sucked!  I'm never going back!  I'd  rather commute to see Dr. Marganian because I know I'll be in good hands as well as my family. We like that they have a flexible schedule to suit our busy lifestyle. It's hard to trust people nowadays so we're sticking with Dr. Marganian and staff.  I strongly recommend Dr. Vicken Marganian for your dental needs.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Joel is a technician who works for Tricon Residential. He is a consummate professional. Whenever I need work done on my home I request Joel. Joel is on time, prepared, knowledgeable and meticulous in his work. He is always in uniform with company apparel. During the pandemic he has ALWAYS had and worn his mask while working inside and outside of the home. He is an engaging conversationalist who is quite informed about current events. I have never had an issue with Joel's work or his professionalism. I would highly recommend Joel as a technician and have no reservations about doing so.</text>

Renting through Tricon Homes has been an absolutely positive experience.  The website is easy to navigate, the staff are professional, courteous  and eager to resolve any questions or answer any questions in a timely manner.   Any things that need to be fixed are fixed by professionals and again, in a timely manner.  Mr. Suarez was instrumental in finding and reaching out to me in regards to vital documentation I left at the rental home.  Ms Ramirez reached out right away to connect me with those documents as well.  If I need to rent again, I will be renting from Tricon Homes.  Their advertising is true to word and the homes on their website are exactly as shown.  Thank you for making my rental experience so positive.< /Review>

Renting our home with Tricon Residential has been an amazing experience. They have always responded quickly and promptly to any issues we have. Bobby has been one of Tricons technicians that we have experienced since moving in to Tricon Residential. He always arrives promptly and has always been very knowledgeable about the job needed to be done. We have experienced a level of professionalism that I can say I am truly grateful for. If we don’t purchase a home in the near future, I can see our family living with  residential at our service as long as we can. I would definitely recommend Tricon Residential to anyone.< /Text>

I had a wonderful experience renting during more than 5 years with Tricon American Homes. The Staff at the Southeast Florida Office of leasing and maintenance has been very professional and has responded timely to all our request. I would reccommend this team to any looking for rental in Southeast Florida.</Review>

I will be renting for the first time in my life and I am super unsure of what that entails. Although I have only just applied, Ashley Dickerson has been a pillar for information and assistance. After dealing with rental companies that never get back or never answer to begin with, she has given us much needed relief. Having a primary point of contact during such a stressful/exciting time in our lives is priceless. Ashley is a phenomenal agent and I feel confident we will find our perfect home with her help! Thanks Ashley!😁💎💕<//Review>

<text>Submitted several Maintenance requests on May 11th and on May 17th, ALL requests were COMPLETED in a timely manner by Service Technician Antonio Clark. After arriving on time, Antonio was ready to tackle all issues on hand. Antonio had a natural, friendly rapport and was very knowledgeable about the job(s) that needed to be performed which I found very reassuring. I also inquired about other maintenance issues that may need further attention. He was kind enough to advise me on the proper form of action to take. I will definitely request Antonio's services in the future. Overall, Antonio is a true professional with a cheerful demeanor and a positive attitude that was extremely pleasant.  It is evident that he truly enjoys his job and Tricon Residential is very fortunate to have a man of his caliber on their team. THANK YOU ANTONIO CLARK FOR A JOB WELL DONE!!! 😊<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1621543095766, 'text': 'Karen Whitley, reviews like this give us motivation and help us ensure we provide high-quality care.'}<//resp><GmapID>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have had the pleasure in working with Shadee Livingston and her professionalism is unmatched! She has been very responsive for anything that I needed her to be and is very pleasant and graceful in doing so!  Any issues I may have, she works hard to come up with the best solution to suit my family and my needs! You can tell she’s definitely one of those professionals that is there for the people and lives by that and doesn’t just say it!<//Text>

Ashley was always on top of things and answered any questions we had. Kevin came out and eased my mind and made the whole final walk through process enjoyable. They all have gone above and beyond with the whole process. Very personable and make you feel welcome  and part of the Tricon family.</review><user_id>106459677717179524909<//user_id>< pics>

This company is by far the best company I have ever had the pleasure of working with/renting from. The application process was quick and easy, I got the approval back within 24 hours of applying. The rental prices are very reasonable and fair. The staff at Tricon is very friendly and helpful. If you rent from this company you won’t be disappointed. I worked with Brian to rent the house and he was the absolute best, answered all of my questions ! ☺️< /review>

I submitted my application about a week ago. I got notification that my application has been approved pending ID. I have provided all needed documentation but the application specialist Miriam Garcia reviewing my documents has been extremely rude to me. She keeps asking me for duplicated documents that i have already provided and gets loud with me when i ask questions. Not sure what is going on but it seems this company does not follow the equal housing law and is intentionally giving me the run around so that i can’t rent a place in a specific geographic location which is an act of discrimination.  The worst part is that when i call the HQ there is no one that can assist me. I will definitely be filing a complaint with FHEO.</Text>

<text>My move was full of issues. First Ms. Bridget worked extra hard to move my move-in date, due a scheduling issue with PODS. She rushed the 21 point inspection, and made sure that everything was ready a day later to accommodate our needs Although! More to the story... During my walk through, I choose a home that wasn't happy with, and was very upset since I agreed to lease the Home. Bridget  and Tiffany came to the rescue to work with me to find the perfect house for me and my family.  Although I was very upset and irritated, they worked hard, stayed professional and was very compassionate to find me the perfect home. I am 6 minutes from Daughter and 1st NEW GrandBaby, and 9 minutes from my best friend! Thanks to you both for working overtime to making sure my family had the perfect home! Thank you Ladies for your dedication! And working late in the afternoon to take care of me!!!  We are truly Grateful!!🙏💕💯🥳<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1621353612278, 'text': "Taniesha Slater, we're so glad that we were able to go above and beyond your expectations!"}<//resp><gmapID>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133</gmapID></record>

The Houston Freeze left us all feeling a bit jaded and rush to get back to normal but the Tricon Maintenance experience definitely helped to ease the stress. They are professional and truly well rounded guys, extremely personable and knowledgeable in their field. They made the repair experience as pleasurable as they could. Huge Thanks to Mark (North Carolina), Carlos (Tampa) and Carlos (Houston) for getting us back home and most of all comfortable, it meant the world to us after being displaced for 34 days. We appreciate all of your efforts and I must mention the management team, Tara for sending out their best!</Review>

<Text>This is my first time doing business with Tricon. So far everything has gone smoothly. The application/approval process was fast and the website is pretty user friendly. My point of contact,  Brian Holzwarth, was great! He always responded in a timely fashion, and answered my questions before and after my big move. My move in date was pushed out due to unforeseen circumstances, but I ended up with a brand new kitchen :-) Brian kept me updated throughout the process. The house was painted, inside and out, clean, and everything in working order. My only complaint is the “Smart Home” feature. The interface lacks everything offered by smart devices. I would have declined this option if I knew how bad it was. I’m reaching out to find out if I can get out of paying the extra $17/month for this useless “feature”

Most obvious issue with “Smart Home”  (Thermostat and Lock) is you have to go to the Tricon website, log in, and wait for the page to load, then select which device you’d like to control, and wait for that to load before anything can be done.

Thermostat -
Pros:
1. The interface allows u to raise and lower the temperature.

Cons:
1. It can’t be voice controlled by Google home or Alexa
2. It isn’t programmable
3. There is no option for alerts of temp changes
4. There is no app to quickly make changes

Door lock -
Pros:
1. You can lock and unlock the door

Cons:
1. It can’t be voice controlled by Google home or Alexa
2. I don’t get alerts on who unlocks the door
3. No tamper alarm
4. No option to auto lock
5. There is no app to quickly make changes<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1620180241858, 'text': 'Hello Janel Drayton, thank you; we appreciate your feedback!'}< /response><GmapID>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133<//GmapID></record>

<Review>Wesley Young is always great! and very helpful. He is very experienced, knows his job very very well. He always arrives before time and is most proficient in his profession. I’m always so thankful when it’s him that arrives to complete the task. I know the job will be done correctly and well.
Overall, my experience with Tricon has been very good. Throughout my residency here they have been very efficient in making sure the house continues to be well kept. Whenever I have had a maintenance need they have come out within a couple off days! Awesome! I would definitely recommend them to others! And Wesley Young is definitely a keeper and I highly recommend him for any job!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>My move in experience with Tricon so far exceeds my expectations.  Our maintenance superintendent Chris was attentive, informative and kind.  The personal handwritten welcome home note he left surely made us feel at home.  Angel, our project managers responsiveness, knowledge and willingness to guide us through the move in process personally again above and beyond.  Ashely, Candace and Senita successfully worked out any system related issues with ease and thoroughness.  Overall, if you are looking for a management company offering stellar customer service; quality homes and superior maintenance ...your home :).<//review>< Pictures>

I notified Tricon about an issue with my furnace. We scheduled an appointment for the next day. He fixed our furnace issue quickly and was very polite and professional! I will ask for him by name should I run into any additional issues.< /text>

< review>
We have rented from Tricon just shy of 5 years and truly believe that it is the best rental company. I believe that this is because of maintenance men like Wesley Young. He's the best maintenance man ever. We never worry about re-work when Wesley comes. He does it right the 1st time. My wife and I love to see the Tricon van in front of the house with Wesley in it. We highly recommend this company.</review>

Wesley Young came out to work on several maintenance requests after we just moved in and I am beyond impressed with his level of skill and customer service. Working with him was a pleasure. He was very professional, kind, patient, and understanding. He went above and beyond to ensure all our concerns were addressed and all identified issues were resolved. If we ever have maintenance needs in the future we hope he will be able to come assist us again.</Text>

Welsey Young did an amazing job! He took the time to fix everything that needed to be fixed. He made sure everything was good to go and explained to me what was all done and what happened to reason things were off. I appreciate the time he took and to get it all fixed and cleared. He even said Happy Mother’s Day because I am a mother! Thank you Wesley! He is the number one maintenance man on your team!!< /Text>

Tricon Residential has some peculiar business practices. They denied my application to a unit on the basis that our income was slightly lower than the standard income they require for the unit. As I was speaking with the application specialist, I asked him/her if I would qualify if I offered to pay the entire lease up front from my savings. He/She said that I still wouldn't qualify!! It is completely absurd that a landlord would not accept the entire lease up front and I couldn't believe it. They did not give me a good reason for income requirement, I just assume that it is to make sure I can keep up with the payments but if I pay the lease up front then who cares! They still get their money. I am upset that I lost $100 in application fee costs for being denied based on this preposterous reason. If I could put a 0/5 stars I would but I will settle for 1/5 stars review for pure ridiculousness. I was not treated unkindly nor unprofessionally. They were actually fairly nice to me. I would like to do business with them if they give up some of their silly business principles.< /review>

<Review>This was my first time working with Tricon Residential and this whole experience has been absolutely AMAZING! I want to first start with the application process. During this particular process my roommate and I worked with a very sweet lady named Taelor Edwards. She was so patient with all the questions we had as well as very on top of communication. As soon documents were submitted she would review and email with any additional info. Michelle Cox helped with the leasing portion of things. She has just been an absolute pleasure to work with and was very communicative with my roommate and I to make sure we get everything we needed done. She would call as well email to make sure we have all the information we need and has been very responsive with any and all questions we had during this process. Although the process wasn’t done specifically by her, I also want to recognize an amazing lady whom answered questions at ANYTIME and ANYWHERE, Candace (I’m sorry I don’t believe I got your last name) but girl! You were so awesome and sweet as well answering seemingly obvious questions to advising us on how to proceed. Thank you ladies for making this feel like home and getting excited for us as well! This year her and I both have been through a lot of losses this past year and so happy to finally have support and finally a win to start this new year fresh!</Review>< date>

<review>I placed a maintenance request with Tricon and they were at my home within a few hours. It was not an emergency issue. The man who arrived was, Tony. He was very professional, friendly and a true gentleman. He explained what he was doing and why it was important. I was very impressed and learned a few things. Thank you so much Tony.< /review>< username>

I’ve been renting a home from tricon for over a year now. I found another house they own that I wanted to move to but spent 5 days calling and calling trying to speak to a person but after countless days of 3 and 4 hour holds and no return calls I finally got to speak to a person....and they told me that someone just signed for it that morning. Things happened and I understand stand that but after spending a minimum of 14 hours on hold over a 5 day window you think that they would at lest be someone what willing to work with you and find a solution but no. They want your monthly payment and that’s it’s after that they don’t care.</text>

The physical location in my state is listed as "Permanently Closed" but the website still exists. It only has a single contact number, which I've tried calling. (Same name, messaging system, and website look as this location.) The first time I waited on hold for a person and got hung up on. The second time I left a number to call me back at. They actually did call me back, and I asked to speak with the person who had emailed me asking for a move-in date so they could send the lease because that person has not responded back after a full day and two emails. I was put on hold, waited two or three minutes and then I got hung up on again.

EDIT: I got a call back from someone in my area and they explained that the location thing is to get all the reviews in one place. The messaging system is the same because every call is going through the one place right now, while they make system changes. Said system work is making calls drop or something. They got me the majority of my lease information before they called me and the rest right after. Super happy with the agent I spoke to.

I think it would help if Tricon could at least put a note on the site about maintenance on the phone system to reassure others that they're aware of possible difficulties with contact and it's being addressed. Also please find something besides the incredibly disconcerting closing of locations to do that still gets all the reviews where they need to be to get a single score. My suggestion if there isn't another option with Google would be to re-open the local places and instead have the numbers get reported up to the home office to be averaged or something similar.

I cannot figure out how to delete the review and I don't want to leave a bad one. I'm really hoping that my problems were just a bad first impression, and I'll update again after more data points. (Original 1 averaged with the 5 star response gets a 3.)<//review>

Wesley Young using PHX25 van is the best maintenance worker we’ve ever interacted with at any rental property/apartment. He is always cheerful, responsive and efficient in solving issues. He remembers our family and gives personalized, caring service. He alone has made our experience with Tricon American Homes a great experience. The service industry needs more men like him!<//Review>

I have resided in the home I rent through Tricon American Homes since 2013. Two other companies have managed the home but I must say Tricon has been the best! I have never had any major issues in the many years I’ve resided in the home but the minor issues (to be expected) have been handled promptly and professionally. I’ve had the pleasure of working with many staff members and they’ve all been more than helpful! Special thanks to Grady J and Anthony G, you guys are awesome!<//review>

<text>Tricon in Charlotte, NC area ....beware. I asked for months to have maintenance items taken care of that still have not been done and I've already moved out.  My last request made in November 2020 was a nightmare, so I started looking elsewhere. The initial individual who came out for the fridge was great even though I called Tricon 3  times to tell them the wrong fridge was installed. After that downhill. I  have photos and documentation to show the poor repairs on the items that were done and Tricon is trying to say they were completed. Beware of renting from them. For what you pay in rent, they are not worth the months of waiting or you just giving up and taking care of yourself.

Fortunately, I've found an amazing new place with a very professional and responsive maintenance team. I get email responses, phone calls back as well as amazing customer service. Try Firstkeyhomes. Night and day difference so far!!</text><Date>1614637546427< /Date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Lately I have needed a few fixtures around my house including my storage and Tricon has been great to work with. The service our local office, in Fort Lauderdale, has provide has been top notch. Great communication (Jose is amazing) and they make sure to come out and get the job done right away. Very impressed by the quality of service and the responsiveness from Tricon and its 3rd party vendors.

Thank you Tricon!!< /Text>< Name>

Wesley Young, came all the way down from Arizona to Houston, TX and was great all the way around. He was friendly and knowledgeable and very professional. He even dumped our garbage cans after he finished. I just had shoulder surgery and he went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. 5 stars!</Review>

We have called a few times to get maintenance requests done and every time we get a quick response. They always are able to schedule someone to come take a look and fix what is needed. Luckily we get Wesley Young EVERY TIME and I have zero complaints. He is friendly, polite, hardworking and great at communicating. I always feel comfortable knowing they are sending Wesley to take care of things around the house! Phx25 van. 10/10 stars if I could!</review>

I just want to give a shout out to the Tricon Maintenance team. My house flooded on 2/17/21. I called them late that night and they had someone out to fix my piping and water heater the very next day. Truly bless and really appreciate the work they did.<//review>

We’ve been renting from Tricon for 2 years now. We met Wesley Young last year when we had a problem with our refrigerator and stove. Wesley is very professional, knows his stuff and super friendly. He took the time to explain the problem and when he is done fixing it, he shows us the best way to keep it from breaking down. He is very informative and helps educate us on how to keep our home looking nice and keep things from breaking. He does great work and always show up in time when he says. We like him because he is a Christian honest man and he is vegan😊.<//review>

Needed a place to live with 3 friends pretty last minute.  Within one short week we were guided and encouraged through the complicated leasing process and ended up with a banger house.  Staff has been extremely helpful and quite frankly is the only reason we even made it in time.  The support staff here, (Michelle and Sarah, you're awesome) was there at every turn to help us out.  One week panic turned into relief, thanks Tricon!</review>

I have had no issues since moving into a Tricon home. They have a great online portal for rent payments and maintenance requests and promptly get back to you to handle whatever issue you may be experiencing at your home. They also have smart home options which are amazing! I basically can manage my home from my phone and am so grateful for this company being great property managers.</text>

I would suggest Tricon for anyone looking to rent a house.   I was in a tough spot, stationed overseas and needing to secure a home before coming back.  Although I didn’t have a phone number- the team was able (and willing) to assist me over email to secure the house I was interested in.

It was a strenuous process.  And I’m forever grateful.

Since moving in, I have been contacted several times to ensure that everything was up to my standard.

The only issue I’ve faced.  And is rather minor.  Is the website portal seems to have constant issues.   But with a phone call or text, my needs are remedied.</Review>

<review>Kevin, Ashley and Andrew were very through and concise with communicating to me and my other room mates about move in requirements and upcoming deadlines. The whole process went very smoothly and whenever we had a question someone was always just a phone call away. Kevin made me feel right at home and reassured me that if any problems come up that Tricon will be able to help in a timely manner. Everyone involved with our move in to the Charlotte area was great and should be used as a training model for the rest of the company! We are excited to be here with Tricon, even through the pandemic the move in was stressless and the home in the same condition as the pictures depicted. I highly recommend Tricon Homes for anyone looking for a rental home in a new area!<//review>< Pics>

I’ve been living in my home a little under two years and every time I have a maitenance request I request Westley Young , he’s the only one I’ve had come out to actually get the job done and left with it finished. My household loves Westley and wouldn’t recommend anyone else. Tricon Residential is lucky to have someone working behind the company.</review>

My family's experience at Tricon was exceptional. They respond to any maintenance requests quickly, they are easy to contact, and the leasing process was easy. The property was fantastic and we loved starting our family there. We ended up having to move due to COVID related issues. I don't think I have ever had a company treat me better! They were easy to contact and made everything smooth with moving out of the property. Can't speak highly enough about Tricon!</review>

I currently rent from Tricon and had the most  delightful maintenance experience today 02/24 with a Tech named Keith. I had issues with the toilet not flushing properly.  He explained the issue to me and replaced what was needed in addition to another issue that slipped my mind to put in a request for in the bathroom.  He also explained the issue with that problem to me as well. He did an analysis of the appliances and items in the home ( Tricon recently took over from a previous owner). He explained a few things that the previous owners never cared to explain or address to me and I have been here for 4 years.   Keith’s professionalism was a breath of fresh air to me coming from and being in the customer service line of business not everyone has it anymore nor do most care but he does and so does Tricon. I had  a different  issue resolved by Tricon In 72 hours that I was begging the previous owners to fix for the past 4 years.  THAT !! IS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TAKING CARE OF YOUR TENANTS.  😊😊 I can definitely appreciate the promptness of Keith and the company he works for Tricon Residential.<//text>

I moved into my home from October of 2014, I started out on a ruff patch, but I want to truly thank Kristine and Wendy to let my home feel like a home 🏡. I could not be more grateful to get all the help I got from them to make my family feel at home. Kristine and Wendy are a great asset to Tricon American Homes. This past October make it 6 years I moved in this home and its the longest I have ever lived in a home since I moved to America 1995. I am a single father and with the help from Wendy and Kristine I feel like they are apart of my family. I thank God for the day when I become a resident of Tricon American Homes, the service I got is tremendous, when call for maintenance there is no doubt that the problem will not take care of. I would recommend this company to anyone as long has Wendy and Kristine is apart of Tricon. Jose is new to me and so far I have no problem with him because he is with the team of Kristine and Wendy. Oh I could not ask for a better team. I just want to say thanks to you guys for all that you have done for me and my family and we truly appreciate you. I lost my job due to this pandemic and i never felt for one moment that i would be homeless,  because they work with me to have a save haven for me and my family. As we look forward for another year I know that it will even get better.

Lynn Kanaly and Kendall Taaffe are simply amazing! They have gone above and beyond for my family anytime we have reached out to them! We are truly grateful for them and we know that if we ever need anything that we can reach out to them and it will be taken care of!< /Review>

Pedro Rodriguez is the greatest! We have been with Tricon for some years now and Pedro always comes with a smile and a friendly attitude. We have lived in other communities, but  the staff and workers aren’t always nice. This is not the case with Pedro. He is a great asset to the Tricon family.<//Review>

I recently moved to South Florida for work. While searching for a rental place I stumbled upon Tricon. I was extremely lucky as they had a very nice home available within my price range and a short commute from work. Brian Holzwarth and his team were incredibly helpful, professional, and responsive. They made my transition incredibly smooth. Amazing job and Thank You so much!!!</review>

My entire move-in experience was great. Anytime I have had anything come up, the management team here has been very professional and responsive, a joy to work with! Also when I did have a maintenance issue, on the weekend, they responded quickly and it was fixed much sooner than I even expected and they were very professional from start to finish.<//Review>

Our experience started really positive with Tricon Residential until it was time for us to move out. We were fortunate enough to close on our own home and needed to break the lease. After consulting with their representative as to the amount owed and an agreed upon date for the end of our lease we moved forward with breaking the lease. We slowly moved our things into our new home, due to me being pregnant and my husband working odd hours, that is what worked best for us. Without a phone call/email/etc., on the last day we had set to move our things, we arrive to a home that has been rummaged through (by Tricon staff - and we know this because they also changed the locks). They STOLE our valuables (a brand new adult bicycle, my toddler’s ride on suv, our mini fridge - left to me by my now deceased mother, as well as my personal suitcase and all that was inside of it and my husband’s weights). He (my husband)was there to collect those final things and they’ve been stolen by Tricon Residential. I can go on about how the house fell apart once we moved inside, or how they send very poorly skilled contractors to put bandaids on larger problems in their residences, a resident in which we paid $1600 monthly; however I think the fact that they stole from their residents’ is more than enough for you to avoid this company. The branch we dealt with is located in Atlanta, Ga.</text>

Our service guy Bobby came out to fix our microwave and do an asset check. He was very personable and professional. Even fixed a couple issues with the dishwasher that weren't on the list.< /Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I have just recently moved out of a Tricon American Home rental.  I was at my location just at 2 years.  From the day I called to set up a self tour to the day and days after move out, I was pleasantly surprised with this rental company.  Move in was made simple and my move in inspector was kind, thorough, and helpful.  The few times I had maintenance issues, they were handled courteously and swiftly.  The maintenance crew was extremely helpful, polite, prompt, and made us feel comfortable in our home.  Although I was not thrilled with the rent amount for the square footage, I was very pleased with the accounting department and their responsiveness.  This company does a great job with tenants.  I would rent from this company again.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

Terrible experience. Seemingly unlawful practices. Lack of customer service or professionalism. I was even told they could not send me a pdf or other printable copy of the lease for review (on a place I had already been approved for and paid holding fee for) unless it was signed and executed by them. Mind you, they will only allow 48hrs to sign the lease but will not provide a copy to review. Further, youre only allowed 2 weeks to begin your lease, but they will also claim you are required to pay the rent 3 days PRIOR to the due date before receiving any keys. I’m under the impression they allow ppl to apply to simply steal the $250 holding fee they charge at the time of the application. If you’re looking for a stress-free easy move in process, search elsewhere.</text>

<text>I have been in my home for 8 years and in that time it has been sold to different property companies. Most recently I have been with Tricon American Homes and when I say they have been a true God-send, I mean it. One of THE most professional, courteous, caring, companies I have had the pleasure to work with. Most notably would be their accounting department (APM) and Ms. Cynthia Castillo. When you look for someone to assist you at a property company you are hoping for someone who is polished in customer service and Cynthia is TOP NOTCH. Every time I work with her she is prepared, knowledgeable, kind, and efficient - those are the kinds of things that make you want to continue a relationship with a company. I just signed my new lease and I couldnt be happier to stay in my beautiful home and continue my relationship with this fantastic company and their stellar employees like Cynthia :-) If you want an amazing home managed by an elite team, PICK TRICON!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1619131970006, 'text': "Jennifer Hernandez, our team strives to deliver an excellent experience, and are glad you found this to be the case during your visit.

I've dealt with several Realty companies in my life as a renter, and I must say Tricon Residential is by far the best I've come across!  From the day I started calling them as a potential renter, they've always answered the phone, answered questions, been extremely professional and always of their word. Anytime maintenance was needed, they were on it. Even as I'm departing from the premises, the staff continues to be courteous and helpful. And if you come across Ahavi on the phone, you've struck gold!  I would definitely rent from Tricon Residential Homes again!< /Text>

Such a pleasant experience would definitely recommend. We were desperately trying to find a place in west palm after a receiving a new job opportunity. Our realtor Brian Holzwarth with tricon made the process simple and extremely fast. He was very punctual through every step of the way and very kind and responsive. Can't say enough good things about Brian and tricon residential!!!</Review>

< Review>
I had an amazing experience applying for, and going through the approval process for my new home with Tricon. The website is easy to use and intuitive, the approval process was painless, and requirements were very reasonable. The biggest factor to my positive experience had to be Brian Holzwarth, the realtor with Tricon. He walked me through everything, explained it all, was right there immediately whenever I had a question, he was responsive and I felt he listed to me and valued my input. Brian is the reason this has been the best experience I ever had renting a home.<//Review>

<text>We rented with Tricon from July 2018 through November 2020 when we purchased a house.  We enjoyed our stay in our rental home and neighborhood.  Tricon was very responsive and understanding when our home took in water during Hurricane Irma a few months after we moved in in 2018.  The overall experience was great and I would use them again if I need to.  I have also recommended them to others, and will continue to do so.<//text>< Pics>

When people deserve a positive review a positive review is due. I rented from this comoany in Florida Todd and Wendy at the office were always great and responsive, Pedro from maintenance the best guy always looking to keep us comfortable and happy. The only reason we moved is because we were able to purchase our new home. At the end everything went great and received my full security deposit with no deductions. Thanks for everything and if I ever decide to rent again I would definetely go to you guys first. I will make sure to recommend any people seeking rent that I know</Text>

< Review>
This management company has gone downhill since it was taken over by Tricon. I have been a resident for almost 6 years and I can’t even get anyone on the phone when I have a problem. I request call backs and never get them. I put in maintenance requests and it takes weeks for approval. I don’t know if they’ve grown bigger then their staff can handle, but Tricon’s service is terrible. I would give them zero star if I could.< /Review>

Renting with Tricon was hands down my best leasing experience. From the beginning to just viewing the homes with the self-tour option all the way to move-out the entire process was simple and stress free. Any time I had a maintenance issue, it was handled very quickly and every staff member I ever spoke with or encountered was very pleasant. 10/10 would highly recommend.<//text>

Brian Holzwarth was an absolute pleasure during the entire application and move-in process. He responded to all of my questions and concerns and made my husband and I comfortable enough to trust the Tricon corporation. Thanks for everything. Highly recommended</Text>

<text>I really enjoyed working with Tricon to find my client a home on a very short timeline. Julie and Michelle were awesome and made the move in process seemless. Michelle went above and beyond to ensure the home was in perfect, move-in condition. I will definitely work with them again!</text>< time>

< review>
I have had the pleasure of renting with Tricon American Homes since they took over the portfolio on my home in 2017. Early in 2018 we had a devastating house fire, which led me to meet Dawn Jones, who managed my portfolio.

Dawn was nothing short of amazing and thanks to Dawn and the team at Tricon, what was an exceptionally hectic occurrence was met with genuine care and concern for my boys and I. Dawn stayed in close contact with me as they rebuilt my home, letting me know what to expect along the way and checking in to make sure we were ok. I was fortunate enough to move back into my home in October of 2018, with the surprise of Dawn and the team furnishing, decorating and making the house completely move in ready for us. I cannot fully express the gratitude I have have for Dawn, going above and beyond for us and our home. I hope to be a Tricon resident for years to come!

Also, special thank you to Dwayne Volkema (Maintenance Manager), for always being informative, responsive and caring. If you ever get the chance to work with either of these people, consider yourself blessed, they’re amazing!< /review>

I rented from them for a little over a year. At the end of the lease they decided to keep ALL of my deposit and not send me anything thru email or otherwise why they kept my whole deposit. I have sent SEVERAL emails and have never heard from them. I think it’s time to get lawyers involved. Places like this is why people are terrified to rent these days. I personally would avoid this company. Their homes are not even handicap available for a disabled veteran such as myself and I got several promises to fix the issues but they never did. Nothing got solved and eventually I had at move as I could no longer access my home due to my injuries from Iraq and their inability to give me proper access to the home for a wheelchair bound individual.</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Stay away - this company is dishonest to say the least! About 2 months ago, I contacted Tricon about a home I found on their website. I let them know my move-in date and they were very friendly in helping me apply for the home I was interested in. Well, the kindness ended there! 3 weeks before my move-in date, the property manager called me regarding a couple of questions I asked over email, as we were talking my move-in date came up. She said it was not guaranteed that I could move in by that date and that I should look for another home - mind I had paid them $350 to hold the home and she did not every try to apologize for what happened.

Fast forward to 1 week before my move-in date - I have to call the property manager several times to get an answer and when I finally get ahold of her she "can't give me an update," even though the move-out inspection was suppose to be done 3 days prior. I call the general customer service line to try to speak to a supervisor and it takes her 2 days to get back to me, ridiculous! Turns out, the prior resident did not move out and I won't be able to move in. Not only that, but they allow residents to give absolutely no notice on not moving out - which in turn completely screws over people that have been 'promised' and have paid for holding the home. Mind this gives me 1 week to find a new home, again, absolutely no apologies from the property manager OR the supervisor and it felt like they were both robots that had no human side and just talked policy.

Update 12/18: To make it even better, they completely lied about what they told me in their response to this review. This company just keeps getting worse and worse, happy to have found a new place to live WITHOUT Tricon Residential.</Review><user_id>112350529060084070500<//user_id>< resp>

Tricon has overall been a great company to rent from. The Atlanta office has been great when working with me as a resident with any issues I may have, especially during this pandemic.

Also, whenever there are any maintenance issues, Tricon is very responsive with sending out technicians to complete the repairs.<//Text>

I don't have anything negative to say about them.  They were always quick and responsive to any issues the house needed.  The repair team was always cool.  The exit examination guy very cool & human like.  I would rent from them again or I would recommend them to any of my family.  I lived in their property for 8 years.</review>

< Review>
Prior to My move in our assistant portfolio manager Belincia Weatherby was outstanding! She was the first to reach out after approval and was very sweet and made sure we knew everything we needed to do and continued through email until move in. She always was quick to respond with any questions we had. After move in we made a emergency maintenance appointment for the heating and A.c. Our appointment time frame came and went, when I called customer service he said the technician came and rang the doorbell and no one was home. And I would be charged a missed appointment fee. I in fact was home the entire morning until mid afternoon around 2pm as I’m a stay at home mom to a 2 year old and no one rang my doorbell. It’s definitely not a good first impression on their maintenance department. We’ve been here a week and we freeze downstairs and it’s 80 degrees upstairs and they want to charge us for a missed appointment I clearly didn’t miss.</Review>

I'm sure it depends on each individual property and city, but we have been in our home for over a year and have just signed another extended lease. I find their prices to be fair and their people to be so wonderful. During this pandemic they have not only offered us help themselves but they have also allowed tenets to ask for outside help and they have accepted those funds and timeline as well. Our home is beautiful and the maintenance requests have always been filled in a timely manner. (Even if they don't have people available, they hire out a third-party if it's necessary) I have even been able to get my fence redone without any fight!! Communication is good. They do get very busy sometimes over the phone but they have a "call back" option and it works wonderfully. I also have my property managers direct email address so we are able to communication on payment issues or updates about the house.

I've been through some terrible rental companies and property managers and I am very very pleased with this staff and company. I was nervous at first since they are so big of a company, but I haven't felt like they have too much on their plate or they are too busy for us.<//review>

When it was time to move in, they are responsive. When you need to break your lease to move, they will avoid your calls and continue charging rent to your account until your balance is finally in the thousands of dollars whether you are still living there or not. I was not able to reach a property manager for over 40 days... only getting a response when I started writing negative messages on social media. They will nickel and dime you on your way out to try to take advantage of you, even if you were a perfect resident. Run for your life , DO NOT RENT FROM TRICON unless you want to be involved in a legal battle upon move out. Even their own employees at the lower level told me it’s what they do. My own maintenance person assigned to our home was not even sure how to reach a property manager. Just so this review isn’t taken lightly, I’d like to state that I am a renter of 15+ years with zero issues of any kind with any other leasing agencies or landlords. My wife and I are financially competent individuals with combined college educations that would rival anyone who considers themselves a scholar. I’m not saying everyone who rents from Tricon shared our experience, but if there’s even a chance that you might, do you really want to roll those dice? There are lots of other options out there, don’t gamble with these people.<//Text>

This place is a joke. Never could get a hold of the property manager. The fence was falling down and they just patched portions of it leaving it in disrepair. The windows leaked and we had to put towels in them  and move furniture from the walls because it was getting damaged by the moisture coming in from the windows and somehow from the walls? 5 or 6 times our water was almost cut off because Tricon would not pay the water bill (Though they usually charged us for it - This arrangement was necessary because the water company wouldn't put water in the tenents name, but had to leave it in landlords which is common from what I can tell). On the upside they did replace the AC unit that wasn't working... After 1.5 years of complaining.... and it still didn't fix it because they didn't replace the thermostat which is what I told them was the problem. Then I purchased a house with my second lease almost up and they wouldn't even work with me on getting out of it just a little early. Haven't been late on the rent once and in this market it will be rented back out within the month. This place really needs to work on it's management.< /Text>

<Name>Shaquanna McKinney< /Name><Text>Absolute worst rental experience. The house had roaches and no one offered to put my family in a new home or hotel while it was taken care of. Then squirrels in the attic. Poor job done on whoever renovated the house as it never stayed warm and my bill was always high but no one looked into it properly or ever reimbursed me when they came in and said the doors had wind gaps. And came and saw that there was a hole in the kitchen where cold air was blowing in from the outside. Really considering suing this company for being slum lords.

I was at first thrown off at the cost to view, but then I respected the $1.99 fee as the process was definitely smooth and fast.  I like that no one lived in the home and all maintenance was made prior to the viewing.  Properties were very well presented.  My only down fall was that the floor plan showing the dimensions was overstated when it came to the closets.  I waited for a particular house to be ready to view because one of the bedrooms had an "overside" closet, almost as big as the masters. When I got there to view the place I walked in and said this is it. Loved the   bottom floor and knew I would love the rest until I seen that it was a LIE.  This happened at another one of there properties. I went just to check.  The closet wasnt even normal but a coat closet labeled as oversided and never in the pictures.  I love to see floor plans because you get a better feel of the roomsize and can confirm square footage as many ads add on sqft or just make up what they feel the sqft is.  I was totaly disappointed and set back to find a place sizable for my family. Other than that I had loved the home and just wish ads advertised as it is as I still would have viewed the home maybe not stop looking and would not have been disappointed!</review>

Tricon’s Dynamic Duo (Candace Stiffel & TJ) have been nothing short of amazing. Just when I thought I wasn’t going to be able to move out of my former home on time, they swooped in and saved the day. Due to a minor hiccup, the property that I was scheduled to move into was not available as planned but the Dynamic Duo quickly found another, even better, option for my family. It was actually closer to the area we needed to be in by about 30 minutes and closer to our local family.

Candace was very responsive and helpful. Every time I needed her whether during or after hours, she quickly responded.

TJ is also extremely responsive even during the Easter holiday when the office was closed.

I’m so excited about this new partnership with Tricon. The ability to have keyless entry to my home is amazing. As a busy parent trying to manage several children, keys are something I struggle keep up with.  The smart home technology offered by Tricon makes life much easier on me.< /Text>

We recently moved in to one of their property in Orlando. The house is great, the professionalism of the staff is awesome. They really make you feel welcome. We had an issue with our air conditioning unit and MR cliff came out and helped us, he was very professional and courteous. I will definitely recommend them to all my friends and family.</Review>

This co. is unbelievable. I have been trying to contact them for months regarding charges on my account. MONTHS!! I left voicemails with Bryan V. I tried even threatening not to pay the rent without a call back. Still nothing! When I call I am left on automated hold for over 3 hours at a time. I have phone records and I left them voicemails. If I don't hear from them I will be consulting my lawyer closer to my lease ending because I am pretty sure they are going to try some funny business. The last time I left a negative review I got a call back within 30 minutes. If they try again it better not be Bryan V.

4/6- again on hold cant get in touch with anyone. They did not make anything right? While I did speak to Bryan the last time my account was never corrected.</review>

I’ve been renting with Tricon since 2018. I moved into my second home still renting through them December 2020. The reason I decided to stay renting with them instead of going somewhere else was one because they are first come first serves bias. Which is what drove me to them in 2018 to begin with. They don’t take your money and everyone else’s looking at the same home like a lot of these renting agencies and then choose which person they want to go with. Instead, if you and another family is looking at the same home, they only allow one person to pay. If the family doesn’t meet the requirements then they will alert you to finish the application process (which will be the payment of the application fees).

The next thing I appreciate about Tricon is working with Latoshia Bates. My husband was involved in a gunshot accident in August 2020 and it left him paralyzed from the waist down. I was already out of a job due to COVID-19 and now he was too. Instead of not letting us transfer to another one of their properties (due to having to have a more wheelchair accessible home) they did with no problem and didn’t penalize us for not working. Latoshia Bates helped with  the entire transfer process as much and best as she could and I want to thank them for her and the company as a whole. I gave a 4 because when it came to speaking to others in the company the timing on getting back to me was not as prompt. However, Ms. Bates was very good at getting back to me and helping solve or deescalate any problems that came my way🤗‼️ They also will work with the family during COVID-19 issues as well.

Overall, I definitely would recommend this company to anyone who is looking to rent. I’ve actually recommended my uncle, and my brother in law and his wife.  The only down side is that they do not give out rewards for recommendations.<//Text>

I've been a renter now going on two years with Tricon Homes, this is the best rental company experience I've had so far. During this pandemic I fell upon difficult times, Tricon Homes was very patient,understanding,and supportive! I want to give the biggest thank you to my property manager Wendy Fable for going the extra mile to help me and my family, I'm forever grateful 🙏 ❤</Review>

I am going no be straight out front with this review,   As a company I gave 3 stars.  I did have a issue with one of there properties and it went on longer than it should have although they did answer every call with a follow up to try and solve it however it could not be solved  while occupied.  As far as the  customer service.... Latoshia  Bates,  out of the Atlanta Office is AWESOME!!!!  After the first call to her things begin to move. She was so polite and really seem to care about what was going on. If it was not for her, our situation could have took a turn that would not have been pleasant for either parties.  Thank you so much !!! Latoshia for your kindness. IF THE STARS WERE FOR HER CUSTOMER SERVICE IT WOULD IT BE A 5. Oh yeah I relocated to another Tricon home and I love it so far.<//text>

We have been renting with Tricon for over a year now and I would not recommend them to anyone. There were things that we were told would be fixed after we moved in and they still haven't been. Two weeks after we moved in our cars were broken into. We went month to month because we do not want to sign another lease and our rent went up to a ridiculous price. There are several tenant fees, I tried to call them and stayed on hold for over 30 min. trying to speak to someone. Once I was finally about to get her on the phone she couldn't tell me what the fees were for and one of her responses to me was "well I don't know what to tell you" Thats just not a response you want to get when you are concerned about fees that they are just expecting you to pay without question.<//Text>

This company is VERY unprofessional to say the least. I saw a home I was interested in on the site. Followed all the procedures which included paying a fee of $1.99 to few unlimited properties for 3 days. I set up an evening appointment online to few a property. Upon arriving at the property and checking into their site, it said I had to be within 100 feet to get the code to the property. The system is operated by GPS which determines if you're at the location that you requested the tour. Upon doing so, it kept saying system unable to locate. I checked my my phone and to make sure my location was on and it was. I tried several more times to no avail. I made a phone call to Tricon and the contact number I was given with the instruction on what to do and got no answer!! I left a message as well and no one contacted me. I started to give up but decided to give it ONE more shot. I requested another tour in the next time slot available after the one I scheduled and when that time came I attempted to get the code and still, the GPS wouldn't locate. I feel that if this company is strapped for cash it could've asked me for $1.99 and I would've given it to them!! Nevertheless, the only person that benefited from this whole ordeal was them.< /Review>

Tricon did an excellent job of fixing my floors when I had a water leak. Ray with the front office did an outstanding job of helping me find a hotel to stay in while my home was being repaired. I am a teacher and I needed to teach virtually from home and could not due to the work that was being done. He found me a room in a hotel and constantly kept me updated on the work that was being done. He was truly awesome!</Text>

Jan Ayers is honestly the best! She brings joy and positive energy daily while putting smiles on residents' faces. Jan is super responsive via phone call and email. If you need something, she's there. That's what I love about the Tricon Tampa team, they all put their resident cares and concerns first. It has been a privilege working with Jan these past few months. She is definitely a value added to this company.

<text>This is to give Kudos to one of the Tricon maintenance people. His name is Wesley. We had a problem with one of our toilets and he was assigned to come out. I had asked that whoever came out wore a mask when they came to the door and the whole time they were in my home. Wesley kindly called me to let me know when he arrived and that he was wearing a mask. He's been here before and we always enjoy when he comes. He's friendly, works fast, and today was especially careful. He wore his mask the whole time and wiped down what he touched. I really appreciated his thoughtfulness and told him I'd let somebody know how much we enjoy it when he's assigned to handle any maintenance for us.<//text>< pictures>

That mind set seems to put some representatives on the defense before they ever hear what the situation is, and to me it comes across the phone during the conversation. After multiple calls, numerous transfers, and "no" call backs - I finally got the opportunity to speak with someone that truly has a "heart and a spirit" of HELP !!
She (Dawn Jones) restored my ability to cope with my situation, revitalized my patience, and help me to re-establish a true connection (confidence) to TAH that was quickly being drained away. Not that she made any promises, but there was a sense of her truly listening and not just hearing me.

<UserId.>102145811234887698198<//UserId.><review>I’m really impressed with the quick response from tricon in regards to an issue with our smart home system. There was some kind of error that resulted in the temperature being set to 85, and the upstairs was even hotter. My pet rabbit lives upstairs and this was extremely dangerous to him. I brought this to tricons attention and they immediately put me in contact with someone to replace our thermostat with a dumb one instead of smart so that this issue won’t occur again.

I’m thankful for the speedy response and that they’re willing to put in a dumb thermostat. My pet really is the most important thing in my life and I’m grateful they’re making this change to our house for his benefit.</review>< Time>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>We are new to the community and are preparing to move into our Tricon Rental Property. I called the Project Coordinator, Melanie Gardner. She was very professional and polite. Prior to our move in (omitting the self inspection), I noticed the mailbox needed to be painted to make it look fresh. When I brought this to Melanie attention she advised that she would immediately contact the Superintendent to get this minor issue resolved and she would give an update. The attentiveness that was provided was superb.
I'm looking forward to have many more pleasantries with this company. Thanks again Melanie.

UPDATE 5/29/2020
All moved in. The move in process was convenient, organized and stress free. The mailbox was beautifully painted as requested and we received a courtesy call from Melanie and the Superintendent (Steve) to ensure that everything was satisfactory. To TOP IT ALL off, I called this morning about an outside broken light fixture and the lights were REPLACED in less than 8 hours. I am very happy with this company.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>I was extremely nervous about renting my first house, but Tricon made it easier! Ashley from North Carolina made sure we were completely set before move-in which gave my mind some ease. Kevin has been extremely helpful to anything we needed to get checked or fixed! I was skeptical because of some of the reviews, but you can tell Tricon actually cares about their customers. Hands down the best company in Charlotte!<//review><Rating>5< /Rating>< pics>

RENTERS BEWARE! I only wish that I had read the reviews before even considering renting from Tricon American Homes.  I have been here two weeks and this has been two weeks from hell.  First, I had to pay fees to hold the house and for a background check before I could view the home.  If I didn’t like the home after viewing  it, I would lose the money I paid in fees.  If I saw another house of interest, I would have to pay another holding fee and for another background check.  You pay these fees for every home you’re interested in.  I’ve lost close to a $1,000 before moving into the house I’m now.  Anyway, the third house that I paid a holding fee and background fee check on I had to move into because I couldn’t afford to lose any more money.  I also had to pay the deposit and first month’s rent before even being able to view this home.  Did I mention all the money paid was non refundable?  I am paying $1,595 per month, plus a mandatory Smart Home fee.  I am paying more than $700 than  this house is worth.  First, the house was filthy when I moved in.  The fireplace was dirty.  The cabinets were dirty and had food remnants in them.  The floors were dirty.  The basement had huge dead bugs and rodent droppings. I mean huge! I don’t even want to go down there.  It appeared that the previous tenants did wood work in the basement and there is saw dust everywhere.  No one bothered to clean it.  The walls (water stains?) and floors are filthy and there is a huge hole in the wall of the basement.  The basement door doesn’t close properly.  Someone can push the door and live in the basement without my daughter and I even knowing.  The house was not move-in ready like I promised it would be.  The house is a dump, uninhabitable, and unsafe.  The roof and flooring  have significant damage.  There are some places that leaks.  They covered holes in the floor with carpeting.  My daughter and I have injured ourselves by stepping in those holes and/or tripping on uneven flooring.  Electrical outlets are not secured to the wall.  The light fixture in the second bathroom is not secure and looks as if it’s about to fall any minute.  The wall in my daughter’s bedroom was not properly painted.  The vents are not secured to the wall.  Blinds are broken.  Some windows can’t open, which is terrible because the house had a horrible odor when we moved in.  Ventilation is poor.  The windows are drafty.  We hear, what we believe, are rodents in the ceiling.  According to the Smart Home App, the kitchen sink was leaking prior to me moving in and it’s still leaking.  Did they even bother to try to fix it?  They yard was not cleaned.   Screens were removed from the windows and thrown  in the ground where they remain to this day.  Not all windows have screens and the ones that do are not in good condition.  The exterior of the house is filthy.  The driveway is in horrible condition.  I fell in the driveway because I tripped over a crack. My right shoulder, arm, and hip are still hurting and the fall was two weeks ago.  I can post pictures if you don’t believe me about the condition of the house.  I don’t know what the next steps should be because Tricon should not be allowed to get away with this.  I would leave, but I don’t know where I would go.  My daughter and I left a horrible living situation and because of the instability we had for the last four years, I wanted to find a home where she would  not have to change schools.  I wanted her to have as much consistency as possible.  However, we are now in an environment that is unsafe for a different reason.< /Text>

{'time': 1607448194708, 'text': 'Pamela, we are sorry to hear about your disappointing experience with Tricon American Homes. We provide perspective residents with the option to view a home should they wish prior to applying if the home is move-in ready. In some cases, properties are undergoing the maintenance process and touring is unfortunately not available at that point in time. We provide perspective residents with the option to apply for the home if they wish to reserve the property or to wait until the home is ready for viewing before beginning the application process. We are transparent with our fees, which are $49.99 per applicant over the age of 18 and $250 for the holding fee. As listed in our Terms of Agreement if you are approved and moved in, the $250 will be applied to your first month’s rent. If you are approved and do not move in, you will forfeit the $250. If you are denied, you will be refunded the $250. If you are approved and decide to transfer your application to another home, you will forfeit the $250. We initially approved you for a home and were advised 3 weeks later that you wanted to transfer your application to another home, at this time we transferred your application and all fees, including the $250 holding fee that should have been forfeited to the new home. Once this transfer was complete, we were once again advised that you wished to transfer the application to another home. Unfortunately, as this was the second transfer your holding fee was forfeited and we required a new holding fee be paid, which we credited towards the first months rent once you executed your lease. We have confirmed that a member of our maintenance team has reached out to you directly to address all maintenance issues. Our sincerest apologies that your home was not up to Tricon’s standards at the time of your move-in. We will continue to work together on this issue to ensure all is resolved. We appreciate your residency and allowing us an opportunity to work together offline.'}< /Response>

<text>I literally had the worst experience here. There is no communication and the lack of service is really appalling. Nobody ever contacts you back even after paying for the application and holding fee they force on you just to apply (+$450). To make it worse the equal lending does not exist with this company. THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY AND NOT CONTACT YOU BACK! Avoid this place and save your time and money. I highly recommend you go elsewhere because the customer service and no professionalism is deprived. If you’re any minority, there are actual companies that want to help and this is not one of them!!! DO NOT FALL FOR THIS COMPANY.< /text><user_id>114752094752482461066</user_id>< date>

We just wanted to say how much we love our Tricon home, and being part of the Tricon family. We've had an amazing experience so far. The house is so well maintained it's hard to remember this is just a rental sometimes! The few minor service calls we had to place were quickly responded to and resolved. We recently worked with Denise Bledsoe on a lease extension and she was amazing to work with! Whenever we see local posts about people looking for homes to rent, we always recommend Tricon.< /review>

Tricon is a typical money greedy property management corporation, my home was bought up in a portfolio that used to be called "silver bay".

The plus side is that they do respond pretty quickly to maintenance requests, the problem is that they are absolutely tone deaf. I have dealt with them numerous times over the past 3 years, most easy tasks are completed without hassle, but don't expect them to go above or beyond.
The bad outweighs the good here.

I would highly recommend going with a different property management company.<//text>

<Date>1604418073415<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><review>In January, we will hit our 3 year anniversary of working as a maintenance vendor for Tricon American Homes here in DFW. The team in DFW is one of the best. Specifically, Jesse, Gary, Rob, and Rafa. I get the opportunity to work with these individuals and it's so nice to see how much they care about their residents and the experience they have. Their guidance over the years has helped us improve our processes and increase resident satisfaction.

We are very grateful for the partnership we have built over the years and I would recommend checking out Tricon if you are in the market to rent a home for you and your family.

Thank you for everything<//review>< pics>

Any rate I would have given I took back. I'm in disbelief of the rental rate increases during covid. With an unblemished pay history I am really disappointed in these practices. Yeah they gave more time to pay(10 days) .. But what good is that if you're gonna increase rent by more than 200. Even a request for my rent to remain the same was denied. Well, no referrals from me.  Also not renewing my lease. Tricon, you should be ashamed.. I pray you do right by your clients or go bankrupt!< /review>

<Review>We had a couple of issues in our home that needed professional attention and they sent out their technician Larenz Suggs to see what he could do. He was very quick, professional, respectful and took the time to make sure everything was in great condition before he left. Excellent technician, great guy. 10/10 will be requesting him again if need be.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>The team at Tricon American were responsive. Quick to approve so we could end our search. The online process made it simple. Melanie Gardner, Janet, Cathy and Andreah were all very responsive to any questions we had. We found all new lighting fixtures, bathroom tile, appliances and ceiling fans. Our favorite part was going to access the property and seeing fresh landscaping and a brand new American Flag out front. Great experience.</Text>< user_id>

I have been renting from Tricon Homes for five years. For maintenance issues, I work with Janet in Indiana and she is very professional and responsive to my requests for assistance. She has respect for me and understands the quality of the condo that I am renting and the standards required of the neighborhood. Dana and Jessica in the office are also understanding and great to work with!<//Text>

I’ve been currently renting from them for about two years now and I would say it’s not best but it’s also not the worst. When it comes to maintenance issues I have to say that is their upside because every time I have had an issue they have always gone above and beyond to fix the problem. However, I spend over $1500 a month in rent alone and I don’t have a dishwasher, and I also have no storage space what so ever not even a linen closet. I have to keep my vacuum in my closet with my clothing along with the mop and my towels which is not very sanitary. Same with the washer and dryer space there is not even a shelving unit to put soap or anything I just leave it on top of my dryer. The bathroom vanity is small and can only fit soap and toothbrush holder. Every year they have increased my rent which is expected but this past year was a leap year and they charged me an extra day for the leap year and prorated an extra day which is fine but extremely petty if you ask me after always paying on time. I also was paying over $300 a month for my power bill for a long time until called about my ac unit and they came out realized half the house needed to be re-insulated and the coil to be cleaned. Which after they have done has decreased dramatically since however I wish I called before. All in all it’s not terrible but not amazing. If the rent was cheaper I probably wouldn’t complain but for over $1500 and every increase, some storage space would be nice. I would adjust my review to five stars if they even came out to just add some shelves just for the laundry room or somewhere to put my towels even.<//Text>

<review>Hello, I have been with Tricon for about 4 1/2 years now and have never ran into any problems. However when it's time for renewal of my lease this is where I have the most concerns. I am a resident who pays my rent on time, make sure the property is kept up good and try to keep maintenance down to a minimal. I've went from a 12mo, 24 mo,  18mo and now only given an option of 13mo for renewal. When I called to speak with the leasing agent to get clarity she was so unprofessional,  snappy and had a attitude as if she did not want to be there. The rep did not even attempt to pull up my account she just provided me with short and snappy answers to where I had to apologies and tell the agent I will call back later. I am so disappointed in the lack of customer service Tricon has working for them to service there tents.  This is the only main issues I have ever had with Tricon and don't understand why.

Update******* I am so impressed with my outcome with Tricon. Alicia and Kamerion return my calls and answer my concerns and provide me with great feed back on how things is handled at Tricon..Alicia went the extra mile and made me feel comfortable with the answers she has given, and also provided me with what I requested..Thanks again to both of you lady"s! TRICON AMERICAN HOMES IS AMAZING!!!</review>< Pics>

< review>
I recently moved out of one of their homes and had a delayed package being delivered there today. I contacted tricon and after speaking with 3 people about the issue, they assured me that I could just show up to the house when it was delivered and get the package as the house was vacant. The package is delivered and before I am able to make it over there one of the vendors they had working at the house decided to open the package and tamper with what was inside of it. Christina from tricon refused to do anything about this and told me to contact UPS. She would not let me finish explaining what happened before rudely interrupting me and telling me that UPS was responsible even though I had contacted her this morning and she assured me everything would be fine. I guess these people don’t realize it’s illegal to open someone else’s mail. Avoid this company at all costs, their properties are in horrible conditions and the only thing they seem to do is raise the rent.

To add some perspective a similar situation happened when I was moving in to my new house and the new leasing company went above and beyond to remedy the situation. All these people care about is money and that should be obvious to anyone that reads the bs responses that Tricon sends to all negative reviews. Invitation Homes is just one of many rental companies that are way better than this unethical company. DO NOT RENT THROUGH THESE PEOPLE

Update: Still haven’t received my security deposit back after moving out over a month ago. They sent it to the wrong address and now Josephine has refused to answer any of my calls. Kind of funny the only number that does seem to answer is Christine from collections.</review>

I am writing this review because I have lived in a rental with Tricon for the last 7 years. I was one of their first tenants, and I have loved living in my home because it is a great good quality home that was renovated and maintained well.  I always work with Jan Ayers. She is absolutely the best!!! She always helps out and takes care of everything I need, or is able to connect me with the right people that can help out! Jan is a super star here . I plan to signup and stay as long as I can.< /Review>

Recently we also had a problem with our AC, on hottest days and pool water circulation system was compromised due to bad timer and water leak! I discussed possibilities with Wendy and Jose to find they went out of their way to solve my problems helping me to feel they were right there anytime problems occur in the future! Thanks Wendy and Jose!

I talked to Wendy this morning, she is taking care of my issue. Very impressive conversation, diplomatic response, very satisfied!< /review>

I stay in Indianapolis, In area and I must say Tricon is a great company to lease from. They are always willing to help. If you have something that needs to be repaired they are right on top of it I have been a tenant with them for three years and I have no complaints. Janet is awesome I just love her she always go above and beyond to help you. Dana is also awesome whatever questions you have about your rent, deposit, etc she doesn’t mind giving you feedback on what you need to do. Their homes are amazing as well!!!< /Review>

Renting from Tricon American Homes has been by far my best rental experience! From the minute I saw the ad stating rental available soon, I’ve had nothing but positive interactions, from Joann helping us to get approved for the home quickly, to the maintenance team assisting with putting the towel bar where it would work best for us, rather than where they planned to put it, to Dawn Jones calling to see how we’ve been impacted by the Covid pandemic and offering to try to help with a grant. It is a warming feeling to know that Tricon American Homes cares about us, as much as we care about our home! Tricon American Homes doesn’t treat their renters like strangers, they care, and it’s refreshing to know that such a big company cares about the little people that have helped them grow into the company they are today! I’d like to extend a Big Thank You to all of you working for Tricon American Homes that has made renting a pleasant experience!< /Text>

Absolutely impressed by the quality of service with this place. Their response time is fast, their rates are reasonable, and their maintenance team (namely Melanie Gardener, the housing project coordinator, who helped us out the most) is amazing and extremely helpful. The house was clean and well put together the second we moved in and we had no worries at all thanks to the team. Much appreciated and highly recommended.< /text>

<Text>The absolute worst experience I have had with a property management company.  My family and I moved into our home on November 1st, 2018.  Five days later, after a day of rain, our entire garage and lower bedroom flooded.  It started as an unfortunate event to bad maintenance coordination and outright negligence.  We have had contractors in and out of the house for months.  My wife and I have taken plenty of days off of work for maintenance people to access the home.  We have had thousands of dollars in damages, and were advised by our renter’s insurance company that because the flooding was due to the property managements neglect to fix the homes foundation issues prior to us moving in, we don’t have a legitimate claim.   Sometimes it would take a week before contractors would come to extract water from the caret.  We complained about a rotten mold smell emanating from the downstairs into the rest of the house.  Advised them that we have children and everyone has had breathing issues since the 3rd flooding.  Tricon eventually sent out their mold tester who advised us, because he was contracted from Tricon, he can’t tell us anything.  We have not been able to use the bedroom since moving in but still are expected to pay for the home in its entirety.  When I requested some form of proration on the rent, the property manager made a one-time concession of $600 as long as we sign their paperwork…we refused.  We have not heard back from them since.  I have called and left messages for weeks and no one has reached out to us.  We are now in the middle of May, we continue to get flooding after heavy rain and do not see an end to this matter.< /Text>< Pictures>

I just wanted to share an experience that I have encountered with Bridget Jones! I've been renting with Tricon for many years. Phone calls have always been short and to the point. This phone call wasn't though! This year like most families it really hit me hard. I lost my job due to Covid-19, i went through a tough divorce, my 3 children and I all tested positive for COVID so we had to quarantine and deal with all having different symptoms some worse than others and top it off the most hurtful thing in the world I lost my father (a sudden death due to COVID-19) all while we were supposed to be happy and celebrating because my oldest daughter was graduating high school and leaving to the Marines!!! I've never wanted to give up on life so much like I did when This all happened!!! I didn't know how I was going to support my kids or even continue living life without my father!!! One day I reached out to Tricon and Bridget Jones answered my phone call to ask her what my options were and to let her know that I'm trying everything I could to pay my rent! I just didn't want to lose our home!!! She not only answered my questions but she actually showed that she cared and was literally the ears that I needed to listen before I was about to go crazy!!! I'm not sure if she was busy that day or what but she made me feel like all her attention was on me. I've never met this women or talked to her a day in my life but she really really really saved me that day! She was able to help me and she went even above and beyond to check on my children and I after that phone call to see if we were ok and even sent a card to just let us know she was thinking of us Through this difficult time!!!! Even though we still aren't back on our feet she gave me hope to keep my head up and keep
Pushing through this rough year!  I will never be able To repay for her for her kind heart ❤️ Thank you so much Bridget Jones!!!!</Review>

Going thru this "new way" of renting a home due to Covid 19 is a bit scary.  I'm old school, we would meet the landlord, go in the house with them etc.  Covid has changed it all.  From the moment we started communication with Latasha Bates during our application process SHE HAS BEEN A DREAM!  She has explained everything to us, sent emails also outlining what steps will happen next & explaining the process again that we had discussed!  Tasha is very personable & makes you feel very comfortable in her ability & in Tricon during these unstable times. Tasha is a "hands on" person, she makes you feel as if she has known you forever & is going to take care of you. Tasha is very professional, responsible & has been a breath of fresh air in these scary times.  Tasha deserves a RAISE - I dont know what you are paying her, dont want to know, I just know that when you have good TeamMates like Tasha you want to keep them happy & around before competition finds out how good they are!  Give her a raise, a big bonus, more time off!  She is a fabulous resource for Tricon!  I am extremly happy to have her in my corner!    Tina McCullough<//review>

Does no follow Georgia renting laws legally. Impossible to get maintenance out there unless you call out of work because its only from 8am-noon. No one actually fixes anything they just talk about doing it. Just don’t rent from tricon unless you enjoy a headache.<//review>< Pics>

She has been extremely helpful and professional. She did all and above to make us feel comfortable in our new home. Also, she provided me with the Flag and pole so I do not have to buy it as well as the hose to water. She is amazing, she returned all my calls or text very soon.

Lisa Hatfield is the ONLY agent who has ever responded immediately to requests with the gazillion houses from so many different companies listing rentals.  She answers every question.  She responds immediately every time I reach out to her.  She is phenomenal in her role.  She's offered to show me several homes after understanding my needs.  (I'm very specific).  Her attentiveness is what drove me to stay committed to the process with her and apply for the perfect home for my family.  I'm hoping this will be an ongoing relationship as I don't see myself wanting to own a home.  I like the idea and flexibility of relocating to different areas whenever I want.

I believe all these companys are theifs i think and this is  just my opion is they take peoples money they pick and choose who has better credit and. Thats how they choose. You can have the absolute best rental history but if your credit isnt good then you cant rent. They should make that very clear before you apply. I have great rental history< /Review>

Just recently moved in a home on December 6, 2019 and I have to say my experience was very good. I applied for a home while it was still occupied and got approved. While I was waiting for the home to come available Matt the Portfolio Manager reaches out to me to touch base which was really nice. Everything went smooth from paying the deposit, setting up utilities, and move-in. I had a few concerns after move-in but they are being addressed accordingly. Overall I’m impressed as previously I was renting from a private landlord. Thanks again Matt the Portfolio Manager out of Georgia</Review>

I’ve been on leave from my job due to myself/children having COVID-19, and my children school is closed. I applied for rental assistance and was approved but Tricon refuses to take the payment. I was told that they have other payment options. The options they are providing requires the tenants to make a payment arrangement. If a person has been off work with no pay how can they commit to such? But what I can’t seem to understand is if there is program from the government that is going to pay up to 3 months of rent for families affected by COVID why won’t they take it? The object is to help and they are refusing it.< /review>

This is my first time renting from this management company.My experience with Claudia Moya. Was phenomenal she’s very knowledgeable patient and respectable..she follows through when she says that she’s going to do something she sends  emails to you if you don’t understand the process and walks you through it. I’m old-school and not very familiar with computers if I had to go and take a computer class. I would definitely have Claudia,be the instructor.  Thank You Rock!!!!!! Claudia

I spoke with Sherry, although I didn’t or haven’t rented any of the properties, she was very helpful. I’m giving her a 5 star because she knew I wasn’t going to be a client of hers upfront and yet she still went out of her way and gave the all the knowledge I needed about another issue I may or may not be having. Some people would have just let me figure it out on my own. I can only imagine if I was her client, her customer service skills, knowledge, and willingness to help is amazing. Thank you so much.<//Text>

<Review>I was a tenant at tricone homes for 5 years it wasn't till this year were I had the worst experience of my life .I am a truck driver so I'm in and out of town alot.I paid my rent every month for five years straight ,even during the pandemic I still manage to pay my rent. The problem that I had with tricon homes was that I had my friend go to my house and move some things that I was giving him furniture wise .He also threw some old furniture away for me as well .Me going back and forth out of town I go to my home and I notice that I couldn't get Into my home .And it was because tricon came and changed the locks and threw all my things away my personal items and everything away like clothes, shoes ,my mothers deceased ashes as well .I called to try and see what was going on because may I remind you guys I never not paid the rent .So I wanted to know what was going on I was placed on hold for 30 min .But no one never came back to phone and it magically hung up .Now at this point I'm angry and to make matters worse they sent me and email stating that I owe Tricon Homes $3,200 dollars for an early termination fee and other expensives for the property .May i remind you guys i did not one time tell tricon I was moving out .so now I have no home ,locks changed and personal belongings thrown out and my deceased mothers ashes thrown away .I'm a at lost for words now< /Review>< user>

(Stuff happens) They communicate with me. When something breaks I report it and I make sure before the contractor leave its working. I know Tricon have a lot of property around the world but PHOENIX, AZ Rocks! Huge shout out to Michelle &Theresa & phoenix location. Hope they offer a rent to own program soon!

<Text>I was considering 3 different properties when I found my home with Triton, and their application process was the fastest. I actually applied with them last and got my approval before two other properties. Michelle and Jose were the best and made the transition painless. When I did my walk through Michelle listened and notated my concerns while Jose walked me through the workings of the home. Thanks to Julie for answered all of my questions quickly during the process. With this company, you’ll speak to a variety of people along the way, but everyone does their part to make the process an easy one.<//Text>< Rate>

Tricon American Homes hands down was one of the best  property management company’s I ever did business with. I had to chance to have my family in a very nice home /beautiful neighborhood. There homes are well taken care of and Tricon makes it easy to get things done for your home just one call or email away. The staff are very pleasant and helpful when needed most. If Tricon homes was in the area I moved to I would have definitely rented with them again. Thanks again for an enjoyable home renting experience.<//text>

Thank you Tricon for making sure we are satisfied and happy.< /Review><GmapID>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133<//GmapID>< name>

<review>Only giving a star bc it’s required in order to submit a review.

We moved in at the end of June. Within 60 days, I had to submit 6 different work orders for the following:
1) Faulty AC unit causing INSANE electric bill
2) Infested with bugs
3) SMELLED LIKE AN ASHTRAY (& I have a 5 month old)
4) The door handles would fall off
5) The real kicker.. Whoever did the remodel botched it SO terribly that a slab leak was found after our first rainstorm. I alerted Tricon of the issue on Monday the 17th. NO ONE started the repairs until the 24th.. a WEEK later. Again, we have a 5 mon old and couldn’t bathe our daughter without flooding the home due to the leak. THEN the contractors cut the internet cable while digging underneath the home to repair. So, we had to go without internet at the house for THREE days. Finally the water was officially cut off for two full days. In the midst of the all of this, I asked for a call back from a manager NINE times. Never received a call back.
6) Bc of the slab leak, the cabinet floors in the kitchen started to ROT. We had bugs all over the kitchen bc of the rotting wood. They had also sunken in substantially.

Tricon has the worst customer service and their homes make it feel like work to live here.<//review><Date>1599232598613</Date><gmap_id>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133</gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< UserId.>

We recently had a couple of issues with interior doors at our Tricon American Home.  Jennifer Henderson not only came to our house to check out the problems, but did an outstanding job of fixing everything in a very short amount of time.  She is very professional and personable.  It was a pleasure dealing with her and Tricon Homes and made my wife and I feel very comfortable knowing that if anything happens to our lease house, Tricon will send a qualified worker over to fix it immediately.<//Text>

Delores (North Carolina) is absolutely amazing! She personally turned what could have been a horrible experience into a great first impression for Tricon. She has made this my best leasing experience thus far. Her work ethic goes well above and beyond the call of duty. I've never met anyone like her. She's very committed to both her company and their renters. Because of her, I'll recommend this company to others. Thanks, Delores!</text>

Once you have found the Tricon American Home that fits your family needs you are in very good hands. This company has hand picked the best of the best employees to represent their name. I recently got the opportunity to speak to and was assisted by three of the most outstanding human beings that I have ever encountered. Latoshia Bates, Lilo Lawrence and Diana Franco. These three individuals are so professional. They will not leave you hanging. They moved promptly to assist and resolve my issues. They were very sensitive to the needs of my family. They always call whenever promised to call or emailed to let me know that they are still working on my behalf to resolve my issues. I just can not say thank you enough to Latoshia, Lilo and Diana. You represent your positions well, you treated me like you cared with kindness and compassion. Because of you I recommend Tricon American Homes and hopefully we will speak again in the near future.

I was referred by Brandi from Phoenix,  truly a great experience. Candace, and Michelle made this an easy process. Team Phoenix are true professionals dedicated to great customer service. Very knowledgeable and able to answer a multitude of questions. I will definitely refer Tricon to others for future home renting. It was a fast and easy streamlined process. Kudos to team Phoenix.

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>We love almost everything about our home and experience. While we have only lived here a month, we have constantly struggled with a strong urine smell upstairs since moving in. My son’s bedroom seems to be where the worst of the smell is, but we have smelled it in every room upstairs. No wonder his allergy medicine isn’t working. Tricon cleaned our carpets twice pre-move in due to this smell. They probably should have replaced the carpet and padding at that point, but didn’t. It’s still extremely strong and aggravating our allergies. The previous tenants were obviously pigs who let their dog(s) pee literally through the carpet in every room. We are looking for a solution to get rid of this smell once and for all before having to replace the carpet and padding ourselves and just bill it to Tricon.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Latoshia Bates at Atlanta, she is an amazing woman and has helped me out so much with everything I have needed and wanted to know. Mrs. Bates is a very professional woman and the team that she works with is awesome as well. If there is any maintenance work that I need done she is on top of it and they get it done very quickly. When I call or email her about anything I always get a response or reply back in a timely manner. Mrs. Bates explained everything to me that I needed to know or didn't understand. I highly recommend Mrs. Latoshia Bates and her team if you're looking for a home because they're professional and amazing and they're honest and upfront about everything. Thank you Mrs. Bates for our amazing and loving home.<//Review>

I absolutely despise this place. Every time to you call to put in a work order or just ask a question there's a long wait time where you ultimately have to ask for a call back (I've only called 4 times). Then it takes hours for a response. The repairs are minimal and no one inspects the work after it's completed. Leaving the work looking like garbage or not even done at all.

We had a work order put in because there was water leaking from the ceiling due to the AC unit. A technician came out, looked at the problem, said he needed to order a part, and marked the job complete instead of ordering the part and installing it. The ceiling had to be repaired after the water kept continuously coming out of it. I had pots and pans catching the water for over a week before it was finally resolved.<//text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Overall my experience with Tricon was a great one, the house i rented was nice and in a wonderful area. The one time i had an issue was with the water heater going out and after i called and spoke to a customer service rep he informed he would reach out to someone and i would hear something back soon and within 30 minutes i received a call from the company who was coming to fix it. The next day, i had hot water again. The only reason i did not give them the full five star rating is because during my time with them i tried to reach out to the property manager numerous times with questions and unfortunately, she never got back to me.  So i was left to call the customer service number which was not a terrible thing but awfully inconvenient because they are on pacific time zone. I would still recommend them to anyone looking though.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>Maintenance and management have went above and beyond for our family. They don't do shortcuts on repairs. They fix it right. I rented with other places and Tricon is by far the best. I will be renting from them until I'm ready to purchase my home. If you want to live in a home that is nice and the company is top notch, go with Tricon. I'd put more stars if I could 😉< /review></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
I’d like to express how great full I am to be renting from Tricon Homes!
I want to give a shout out to Yolanda for being an amazing communicator and supporter.  Yolanda is a very kind, sweet, patient person. She’s soft spoken and genuinely cares about her customers. My family and I are grateful for a person like her, because it is hard to find good people like that. Thank you Tricon Homes for allowing me and my children to live in this beautiful home. We pray to live here many more  years.  For any customers reading this review, renting from Tricon Homes is definitely well worth it.

Sincerely, Angela<//Review>

I applied to Tricon because honestly the property was beautiful. I spoke to John when I received the denial, he explained to me overall it was the credit score. I explained to him that when I initially applied my agent spoke to one of his team members who explained that as long as there was not broken leases, evictions, and bankruptcies credit was really not a problem. Upon hearing this, my hopes were up and I applied. Well now I am out about $100 for reason I was very much aware of but still took the leap. Apparently they have refunded they $250 holding fee today. We will see if this is true as I have called my bank already and no refunds are pending. Honestly DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOUR CREDIT IS FAR FROM PERFECT. They will lie and tell you they can work with it "conditional deposit", it is a lie. On top of everything, when I expressed my concerns to John, he stopped talking all together and hung up me,< /Text>

Re: Gina Nelson:
Gina has ALWAYS been a great help to us. She is a great manager for us.
Years ago, in Wisconsin, when Elaine and I were first married, we rented a downstairs apartment for 3 years before we bought our first home. The owner/landlord was not, anywhere as nice, good, and knowledgeable as Gina is. She needs to have this job, and deserves a raise in pay. Thank You Gina for all that you do.

I am currently in the process of moving in, but wanted to give a good review to these guys. I have worked with Rorie Jones, Fred Martinez, and Zach Strand personally. Each have been patient with my questions and answered everything in a timely manner.  The home is a rental, but in better shape than any others I have looked at.  They have been attentive so far, and I couldn’t be happier with the move in process. Hoping things continue to go well, and I look forward to renting a home from them!</review>

<Text>My family and I absolutely love our home.  I was a little leary about the $200 hold fee but I have to say our fears were put to rest..we moved in our home 9/1/19 and the process was so easy and smooth.  We have had some maintenance issues and they have always been professional and nice and super quick to respond and fix the issues. We look forward to to a long relationship with Tricon homes.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>As a neighbor to a Tricon property in metro Atlanta, it is refreshing to know that they care enough to consider their neighbors! This is incredible because most rental companies are self centered and focused on their profits while ignoring the obvious.

A breathe of fresh air indeed!

Lord bless!

<Text>I must say that in the 13 years I have been a renter I have never had such a seamless, stress-free experience as I have with Tricon American Homes. From the initial application process that Bonnie stepped me through (step by step), to the application acceptance process that Susana patiently guided me through, and last but not least to the rental process Michelle made nearly effortless (not easy to do!) These ladies contacted me back in a timely and professional manner and treated me with nothing but respect and kindness. Thank you to the Tricon team for your grade A service. It’s an absolute pleasure to work with you!<//Text>< pictures>

< review>
I lived at one of Tricon Homes for over 4 years. I was never late.  I went 2 weeks with no working air condition in 115° heat and did not complain.  I moved out and owed damages to paint and carpet.   Asked to have my due date for my payment arrangements to be around my pay date which is tge 20th of the month. Enrique stated "noted".  When I received my arrangement form..it stated the 15th. He would not work with me at all.  So sad this company works this way. I used to recommend this company. but I will no longer do so.<//review>

Tricon American Homes was wonderful to work with from the application process to the checkout process.  Everyone in the local office was responsive and very professional.  Nate who handles all walk throughs and maintenance requests was awesome to work with and was always there when we had questions or needed help.  He is an excellent representative of the company and should be commended for the job he does.<//text>

By far the best rental company anyone can ask for.  I am a single mom to 3, my youngest is special needs and we face a lot of challenges as is so when something needs fixed they are on top of it immediately, I’ve never had to wait long. They’re the most caring individuals from small things to big they are there for you. Recently I lost my job (major stressor) and I’m having a tough time finding work again. I have no other help and no money saved, so I was in fear of being evicted. I called my account manager Christina and she listened to me explain my situation and suggested I apply for their emergency fund (something Tricon does for their families in need) I was approved and they took care of my rental payment. I was so happy and relieved to know my children and I still have a home and I have extra time to look for work. We are not just tenants to them, we are family. I am forever grateful for their generous hearts, I wish more companies would be as compassionate and understanding as Tricon is. It would make this crazy world we live in a little bit easier for the daily challenges we all face. Thank you again Tricon!< /Text>

If I could give less than one star, I would.  This company went into contract with me to buy my home and then tried to nickel and dime me for pennies on the dollar.  They were a nightmare for my agent to work with, never responding...she had to call multiple times to ever get answers.  They backed out of the contract after the option period.  Just extremely unprofessional.</review>

< review>
I too have had a great 5 year experience with Tricon American Homes.

The only thing I can ask to be improved is the rent payment portal.
If I own $16.00. (above the rent amount) and have my rent paid automatically through my bank. I am unable to make a partial payment at any given time throughout the month.

The portal currently requires me to pay my rent total as well as the $16.00. (But then on the first of the month my rent would be automatically paid by my bank, causing a double rent payment and if I stop the payment through my bank, I am subject to be penalized by an additional fee. or not being allowed for a full year to pay automatically.)

There is a very small window in which I can make the $16.00 payment with out having to also pay the amount of my rent.

This has happened to me. It was frustrating, but Lydia Cole was a great help assisting me to navigate this bump in the process, but it did take a full year.

Happy Holidays Tricon American homes.<//review>

My family has been with Tricon for 3 years now, we recently wanted a change and needed more space, we found a house that Tricon managed and we were able to transfer properties. They made the process simple and easy! When we got to the new house it was amazing, Tricon took pride in the property as it was very clean and almost like new!  If we ever made a maintenance request they were very fast to respond to our needs. I plan to stay with Tricon as long as i am still renting, i have already recomended them to my friends.< /Text>

Finding a new home is always stressful but working with Tricon American Homes was a easy transition. Today I experienced my first move in inspection with Jesus Alvarado.

My boyfriend and were in the market for a new rental with about 3 weeks max to find one, and Monica G, the leasing agent in the Atlanta area, helped us set up self tours of multiple homes with as little as 12 hours notice in some cases. She was so responsive even being incredibly busy, and when I couldn’t reach her the Tricon customer service team was just as helpful. We worked with a great group - Matt, Monica, Daniel, Marcia and Carlos as well as the customer service reps we spoke to. We genuinely feel they all have a strong sense of integrity in what they do, and they made our move in process seamless. We plan to stick around with them for a bit for sure. It also helps that our new home is gorgeous and everything is completely new. Granite countertops, double vanity, two car garage - all on a waitress and bartender budget. 10/10 would recommend to others (and already have)</review>

However, I was particularly pleased that after we worked very hard to clean the house for move-out, they did not nit-pick and look for ways to charge us. I also enjoyed the service of Latoshia Bates. When there was a mistake in sending our deposit refund, she worked to correct the issue and get us our check. She also was happy to recommend me to a new property management group after my move out!<//Text>< gmap_id>

I just left a rental from Tricon homes property management.  If I could have stayed with them I would have.  The neighborhood I was in turned out to be terrible.  However,  that was not Tricon home's issue.  The entire team that I dealt with throughout my 2 year rental with them was excellent.  Anything that needed to be fixed was quickly taken care of.  The few representatives that I was dealing with during move out were extremely helpful and efficient.  They are a good management company.<//Review>

The entire process from finding a home to moving was a breeze. I was a little skeptical because the company is not local and all communication was via email but after speaking to Amira, I felt completely safe to move forward with the move in process. Sunday afternoon I drove around and looked at homes (self tour), found the perfect home....went back home and applied that same night. The next morning (before noon), I had an approval email from Tricon! From there it took no more than 72hrs to get everything finalized.
Fast forward to moving in....On the first day, I met with Michael, who did a walk-in inspection with me (first time experiencing this) and he ensured EVERYTHING worked probably and wrote down any issues that I saw (which was only a smell when the water was ran...that was fixed the follow calendar day)! The move in process took about an hour because he was very informative and made sure I understood how to submit maintenance requests in the future. The entire Tricon Team was awesome to work with. The only “Con” is that I’m currently having an issue with them withdrawing my first month payment and I’m being charged for something I believe I shouldn’t be charged for. Other than that, everything else is going amazingly! I couldn’t have asked for a better company to rent from! Oh, did I mentioned they rent out NEWLY BUILT Homes...such an amazing feeling to be the first one to live in a home and not worry too much about maintenance!!! Nice job on everything Tricon, I’ve been recommending you’ll and will continue to recommend you’ll to any and everyone.</review>

Tricon has been great! I’ve been renting from them for 4yrs. I have no issues with them repairing things. They take proud into their properties. Teresa and Michelle in the Phoenix office are wonderful ladies. So understanding, and respectful. Thank you Tricon!</text>

I just recently applied for a Tricon American Homes property (46217 Tricon Homes). I was really skeptical of the virtual process at first but I’m at the end and I can say that they have a great process. Dana Keyes was assigned to me as my point of contact for moving in. She has been great and has always gotten back to be in a timely manner. On my move in date I met Luke at the home and he was really awesome. He answered questions I had and really represented Tricon as if he was the CEO of the company. I work deals with quality and process improvement and I know from experience that it is hard to find dedicated employees who will represent you as if it was their own company. Kudos to Luke, Dana and Tricon American Homes and I hope my entire experience continue to be great.< /Text>

Tricon Homes has been fantastic to work with. They bought our home, then let us rent it b/c we did not know where we wanted to move yet. Michelle Harne, Assistant Property Manager is absolutely outstanding, working with her is an absolute pleasure. They have made the transition from owning to renting to now owning again a very smooth transition for my family & me. I highly recommend them.</Text>

Each time I have called Yolanda Jones assistant Portfolio manager for Trican American Homes she has responded to me in a quick manor. Always very polite and professional on the phone. She seems to have that spirit of wanting to make your experience with Tricon very memorable and relaxing.  This is our first time renting a home and she's made it easy to do.<//Review>

I had an amazing experience with Tricon! Ashley reached out and made it possible for me to get a home for me and my 3 kids. Others turned me down and didn’t call for extra information or anything. But she did. And that one phone call changed mine and my family’s situation! Kevin and Josh at time of move in answered all questions or concerns I had. If I brought something up, they fixed it right then! Gave me there personal number just in case anything. Which is hard to find now a days, they usually give you a 1-800 number. So I really appreciated that! Thank you Tricon!< /Review>

<Text>After a year as a tenant with Tricon, I only have the highest praise for their professionalism and responsiveness. They give me the feeling that they genuinely care about me as an individual - something I didn't expect from a nationwide corporation. Monalisa D in Phoenix has been particularly helpful to me. She responds quickly and has been particularly helpful during these "covid" times! Thank you Tricon and Monalisa for making my rental experience comfortable, easy and downright pleasant. Keep up the good work! Needless to say, I highly recommend renting from Tricon.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

*****UPDATE: We have been able to resolve our transfer issues & we appreciate the quick response of those who helped us. Moving out of state is stressful enough & it has helped knowing that the quality of a Tricon home would be waiting on us. I now recommend this Company & the assistance of Melanie, Addison, Ashley, Dawn, Lisa Marie & Janet in the Southern Market. Thanks & God Speed!******
If their purpose statement is "To go above and beyond, with our time, care and service, so that lives and communities are enriched", I suggest they start answering their phones & emails & voicemails!!  We have rented our GA home for 3 years & recently my Husbands Company is transferring us to FL. We figured it would be easier to stay w/Tricon to have deposits & such transferred over to the new rental. Boy were we wrong - we were told when we gave 30 day notice that someone would be contacting us. No calls or emails & voicemail box is full when we call — now we have 2 weeks & these people STILL haven’t contacted us at all. From the reviews I’ve read & people I’ve spoken to - these people are not professional & do not care about their tenants. Period. Multiple calls & emails & requests for showing the new properties have gone ignored. We will be seeking legal counsel to rectify what I know is coming with this Company, if not resolved in a timely manner.  Do yourself & your Family a favor - rent is high enough - rent from people who care about providing a good service that we pay for!! BEWARE & God Bless!< /text>

I’m honestly shocked that this company actually has bad reviews - our experience with tricon has been so good that we keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. We needed a place super quick and they helped us get into a wonderful home within 2 days. While there have been a TON Of issues with the home (faulty oven, pipes bursting, heater not working) they’ve sent out maintenance crews within 1 day of us reporting each problem, all of who have been so insanely nice and professional. We’re coming from living in NY where our apartment had a black mold infestation and a management team who did everything possible to get out of removing it, so needless to say, we’re relieved and overwhelmingly grateful to be working with Tricon.<//Review>

Prior to Tricon American Homes, I have had a couple different property management companies through my current residence. I’ve never dealt with such a welcoming and polite company that truly makes their tenants feel at home. I would definitely recommend Tricon to anyone looking to rent a home.</Review>

<text>Once again what can I say Tricon American homes that stepped up to the plate as they've always have for the past year plus. I am a Disabled American vet and after a major 2 day surgery I needed lighting for the driveway of my home. Having Home health aides coming in at all hours of the night and day during what's now is now the Winter months and it becoming dark much earlier in the day, not alone my own safety.  A quick fix was employed by using a solar LED light until permanent light fixtures could be attached to the sides of the garage. Using a professional electrician to hard wire the lights on to the sides of the garage, this included moving and replacing of items in the garage. Even clean up was spotless.</text>< pictures>

Then we speak to someone named Jessica who laughs at my spouse who is informing her of our situation due to Covid-19. The representatives provides you answers to questions that they do not have knowledge on and then someone else informs us that is not correct and we as tenants are left in a bind based on misinformation from the company. We have been over charged more than the $1200 rent multiple times since April when we moved in a has had the same toilet issue since we moved it. Maintenance has been out 3 times for the same problem and its still not fixed. They send out people who cannot fix a simple issue. Tri-Con is no better that First Keys Homes and they are extremely horrible. We thought we going to have a better experience leaving First Key but I'm starting to think they are all the same. If you want a beautiful property with a horrible property management company that overcharges you and their employees laugh at your situation via phone this Tri-Con is the property management company for you! We will not renew our lease nor do business with this company in the future!< /Review>< gmap_id>

JP the maintenance representative from Tricon was absolutely amazing! I had a broken sink, dishwasher and toilet that were all addressed withing two days of me requesting maintenance, and fixed withing 2 days after that. I love this company more and more each year and feel so relieved that I found them. They have a great staff and are very punctual, professional and transparent. I look forward to being a client of theirs for a long time.<//Text>

Rentals in the Phoenix area are in short supply and it makes it very hard to help tenants find a property to lease. In addition to the MLS, I have been providing a list of property management sites to tenants so they can cover all the bases. This is my first experience with Tricon American Homes and I'm happy to say they've earned my respect and trust. Candace Velazco, in particular, went out of her way to help us. She answers her phone and responds to her email, even when her work day is technically over. She's both friendly and professional. Tricon's website is easy to maneuver, and their homes are very clean and well-cared for.< /Review>< name>

<Review>Great customer care. But should be more open minded about accepting HUD HOUSING. IF COMPANIES TRULY THINK ABOUT IT AND STOP DISCRIMINATING de to stereotypes see as black or brown low class rowdy misbehaving ingrates. Or lazy not wanting to work individuals. That's not always the case. HUD guarantees 90% of their monthly rent portions so it's more then likely the tenant will stay long and pay their small portion. With a regular tenant it's more worry of a eviction , running out on rent , having to sue and court fees. Don't screen HUD participants by their race or your personal views. Go on their History of not having a criminal background , no destruction of property,no police reports, on time rent payments , or if they have many kids . Doesn't mean their bad they could be straight A non problematic children. Assumptions are WRONG. Give people a fighting chance you never know what's really going on. These people are coming off the streets. Your life too can be changed in a matter of moments or based of one bad decision , a unlawful loss of a job , no family support etc. Not everything is black and white</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133<//Gmap_id><rate>5<//rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Taking the time to express what a terrible company Tricon American Homes is. Ive been in this property for 11 months and have had nothing but problems. The renovations were cheaply made and when reporting an issue, it takes them months to complete the work order. I've had mold issue, termite issue and sealing problems. The back lanai screens were blow off by hurricane Irma last year, I reported the damages right after  and today 4-26-2018 (one month before my contract ends) they came to repair the lanai.
Moving forward, I requested to be transfer to another property since they declined my other request to not increase my rent as the property is not worth it and due to all the listed problems I've had. Ill be following up with a new review as soon as I have more information on the transfer.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPO_Ygfht_wN3jrvcET1BdTyHkVzFYv2z_Bym0t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHZIzXcqJmbvAH3ar3CYcGHAVREIvwRM9fDBvQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7m87v0hXWLpIlTDViED2no-fXZzKzOM2u-Zh7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNl35y31b7_gRkPEamUgDX_YIVIGJdc3rh_UJlh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOj4rZeXXxTfdycdZSx28zlmUm79-Jdgyfcx-B1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3bvxFDoTMHdKuC0e8kbLyOkgU4u5nNZp4kDeX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOF48cO1L28kBy1Yl8eOhSQQlMrvzAlOTxtfCdQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPozsoPf-NMj1Ku2YHPLe0FJzoJcQXJXlPExGPp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiyXB6gwSl4LWj6sJdrdL1wDl9DtPpWJ2vL7Xh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwnSzNSAELlszktlpCQ3tIKI51i5EB-5wAxP7F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV58lqRtp5no59j711-pgmIggsc1L1czIGzr0d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have been renting This house for 6 years. Before Tricon took it over, we had another mgmt company that wasn't as good. Tricon has managed it for the last 5 years and always makes us feel valued as a resident. They get things fixed when I put in a service request.   I'm especially pleased with the recent situation I had. I really like the way they have it set up now. In the past, they used contractors for maintenance requests. Now they have a maintenance manager, Alex, and a maintenance man that is their own employees, JP.  2 days ago, on a Sunday, our A.C froze up. We were very hot and miserable. Both professional A.C companies that they contract with were booked up until Monday. I didn't want to wait that long. Alex called me and wanted me to know he was trying to get me taken care of right away. Since both companies are booked he called Jp, the maintenance man. Jp doesn't work on the weekends, but he came over here to my house any way. Jp is very nice and he's very knowledgeable. He was sweating under the face mask so much yet he was not irritable and he still went beyond what he had to do. Alex had him bring 2 portable ac units incase he couldn't get mine fixed. So that were at least have some cool air. But they were not needed. JP cleaned the inside of my unit and gave the unit freon and made sure the vents were blowing cold before he left. He was very friendly and bent over backwards so to speak, to make sure we were takin care of. And so did Alex. Alex stayed in touch with me and wanted to make sure we were happy and comfortable. And apologized several times for the inconvenience. He was so kind and thoughtful and helped to easy my frustration over the ac not working. He's also let me know that it's important to them to get all our repair needs met. JP told me that Tricon treats the employees very well too and is always telling them that the residents come first. That they want the residents happy. That's awesome! We didn't get that same treatment from the other mgmt company.
If we ever move, I hope Tricon will be our rental mgmt company. I've also dealt with the office staff for leases and other things and the entire staff is wonderful. I'm so thankful for all the staff at Tricon.
And I'm especially thankful to Alex and Jp for fixing my A.C problem. It's so nice and cold now. I'm so very thankful and feel so cared for.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1596562565242, 'text': 'Hi S R! Wow, thank you for taking the time to share about your positive experiences.

<Review>Tricon has beautiful and we'll maintained homes here in Tampa. The communication lags are maddening.  I have been in the home since March and unable to use the pool and hot tub. Each month I pay a pool maintenance fee of $95 and the pool tech does little more than skim over the pool with a net, never removing debris from the pool bottom. Also the hot tub  does not get hot! No one has responded to my request about the one feature which was a deciding factor in our decision to rent. Please expect long delays when you call and hope to get someone on the line who handles your particular concern, otherwise you will just be transferred to agent after agent.< /Review><UserId.>107022499505649742416<//UserId.>< Rate>

Typical renting relationship. There are things that could go better, but there are so many things that could be worse! They are quick to respond when I need it and they have allowed us to paint and make the house our own. They fixed the mailbox when it broke and they had it fixed right away. Overall, happy with my experience.</text>

This process was amazing! Everything was done electronically which made everything so fast. We viewed a house on  Wednesday, we loved it and applied the next day on Thursday, then got the approval on Friday! We're moving in today and we're so EXCITED! Kevin K. assisted us with the walk through/inspection and he was so thorough! He provided us with his number and told us that we could call him anytime if we had any questions or concerns about the house and he was so sincere! He was nothing short of amazing!🤗</Text>

First and foremost I would have to say thanks to the company for sending someone out to caulk the windows and look at the furnace. I really don't think they did a good job, but they did it ok. Either way I was told that once all this was done I would be compensated on my bill. Now I'm told that this can't be done. Who in they right mind. Living on a fix income can pay one month $1,000.heating bill and the next month $500.00 with and I might not say how much my rental property is costing me.
Not trying to be a Debbie downer, but can a girl catch a break. I'm sitting in my living room with heaters. And heating blankets, why... Let's make this make since. Do I need to call the heating and cooling people my self to get some real answers to why this downstairs will not heat up. Don't know if I'll renew my leases.
Mrs. Mayberry. That's my daughters screen name up.</review>

<Text>We leased a 3 bedroom house from Tricon in the Brandon, Florida area. We stayed in the same house for 5 years and took excellent care of it. When we vacated, our complete deposit was returned to us.

There are a few major players when it comes to home rentals in the Tampa Bay area. Some of those companies have such awful online reviews it's a wonder they're still in business. I'd be mortified. Tricon, on the other hand is NOT part of those awful rental companies.

We did not have a lot of maintenance issues in our 5 years of leasing, but when we did, they were taken care of very quickly. We would rent from Tricon again.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>I am not renting from them and unlikely that I will in the future as I have had so many issues just trying to look at their homes. I call every number given leave messages and never received a call back. The one time I talked to someone she dismissed my issue and did not give me relevant information that could have possibly helped resolve my problem. She just said if you have more issues call back without trying to resolve anything.</text>< Rating>

The maintenance staff is second to none!  Philip Picard came to my rental for a leaky faucet repair.  He went above and beyond, even so far as checking my pressure restrictor valve in my garage!  Because of the service techs, I would consider renting from Tricon in the future, and would even refer friends and family.</Text>

My Father and I have been residents with Tricon American Homes since August of 2017. Any issues we may have had have been quickly and efficiently taken care of. Our favorite person to talk to is Mabel Rosario! We trust her and she cares! She explains everything clearly and matter of fact fully. I know that if anything should need to be done she will take care of it for us!

I did not know where to express my feelings on the company so I figured I would reach out here. Tricon American Homes has been a breathe of fresh air. Me and my wife love our home and our property manager Dustin has been great and responsive! My only complaint is the way they do their maintenance. If a problem occurs with the home they deal with outside companies with strict time schedules. Also a person must be home for the work to be done. So you will need to take off work, or have flexible scheduling. This I can live with, however, the maintenance supervisor Janet Oliver is very rude. I have requested a call with her before and she refused to take my call. I had an incident with my garage ceiling leaking, falling, and gushing water due to the shower running. After sending pictures to my property manager, I was told to contact the emergency line. An independent contractor came out and looked at the damage and scheduled a follow up. Great! I now have peace of mind with all things considered. I then receive a call 5 minutes later from Jan reprimanding and trying to talk down to me as if she is superior in every way telling me to use another shower and it wasn’t an emergency So!... With that being said Tricon understand that customer satisfaction especially those who pay is of the utmost importance. We also would not like to be talked to like children by your company representatives. Thank you I will keep everyone posted on our experience going further.</Review>

<review>Editing my review... Alain from Tricon reached out to me. We came to an outstanding agreement that works with my budget.  I am very grateful for Alain reaching out to me, to not only discuss my below concern, but he was very committed to finding a resolution while ensuring the happiness of my residency.  I am very pleased with my resolution and decision to rent from Tricon. Thank you Alain for turning my frown upside down.  You deserve 5 stars!

My lease begun May of last year and I have enjoyed my home and the service I have received thus far.  I gave Tricon 3 stars because I received a request to renew my lease and was shocked to see my rent would go up by $100. I am really disappointed as I expected to be a long term resident. A$1200 increase per year seems pretty ridiculous to me, but I guess this is the difference when you go with a national company vs the local guy. To increase rent by almost 6% is crazy, employers don't even give 6% percent raises or cost of living raises. I am so disappointed after being so pleased with Tricon.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>This is about 1082 Hasty CT. SW. Lilburn, GA 30047 - DO NOT RENT UNLESS YOU HAVE PROOF THEY FIXED THE MOLD ISSUES

V.2 EDIT - STILL ONE STAR!! I just received a call from Tricon to fix the mold after moving out for about a month... This company has no communication or organization. I feel so sorry for who ever rented out last house and I hope TRICON fixes it before they have any health issues like I did.

V.1 EDIT - I did receive the promised concession along with my security deposit AFTER posting the review...  Sad how this company only helps after you expose them! AND, a few weeks later I saw they posted the house for rent again. No changes. I believe renting a house you know has mold in it is ILLEGAL! If you're looking at 1082 Hasty CT. SW. Lilburn, GA 30047 DON'T RENT! There's hidden mold that will come back a few weeks after you move in.

WORST PLACE TO LIVE! We rented two homes with Tricon in Loganville and Lilburn and BOTH had issues they didn't resolve. The first house in Loganville had septic issues, FECES FLOODING IN THE GARAGE! Lived there a year and a half with no resolution! They offered to move us but not without a TRANSFER FEE OF $500! Second home we moved into had MOLD growing all through the house. They covered it up with spray paint and after multiple attempts to get them to fix it I couldn't live there any longer with asthma issues. They're taking back promises of moving expenses because we won't transfer to another house... DON'T RENT FROM THEM!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I have had a great experience with them. I went to look at the house last Friday, filled out the application that afternoon and by the next day I was approved. Briyana was so helpful with all the paperwork and approval process. Ashley was there to help with the lease and answered all of my questions. Kevin was super awesome and did my move in inspection with me. He was very knowledgeable and super nice. I am super pleased with all the staff so far and look forward to living in my home! Everything was clean and in great condition. Thanks Tricon for being amazing through this whole process as moving is already stressful enough and you guys made everything so easy!!< /Review>< pictures>

My 5 years renting with Tricon has been amazing. The customer service is top notch. I work in property management so for a company to go above and beyond as Tricon does is hard to find. The online portal is awesome I was able to put in online service requests, and they always were taken care of immediately.  My stay there has been nothing but great the only reason why I moved is because I purchased a new home. I highly recommend Tricon American homes.< /Review>

We moved in 2 weeks ago. We had/have a few problems with the plumbing in general but they have the repairs guys the next day.  Everyone is extremely helpful and friendly.   So far i love the new home and the service by tricon.    !$$  //// ...A little update after 6 months of living here.   This is by far the best property management. They are always helpful and go above and beyond to take care of things.  We are very happy we moved here.</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Do the minimal possible. Take a long time to return calls (days or weeks in some cases) unless they want something, especially if it involves money. Terrible IT department - took over 6 months for them to finally correct our auto pay issue and stop cancelling the auto pay we has set up. But then would send nasty emails about us being late after they went in and cancelled our auto pay. The house we were in had a hole in the floor under the carpet that was never fixed. House infested with termites. Offer no incentive for 2 year leases and continue to raise rent yearly. Make you pay for pool cleaning but never address any of the real issues with the old dirty and broken pool. Couldn't use it half the time because of how dirty it was because it stopped filtering. Horrible company that i hope i never have to cross paths with again.< /text>< pictures>

Tricon is a heartless mega corporation. They 100% put profit over people. They took possession of the house we were renting the morning we were getting it cleaned. We still had the whole day and they turned away our cleaning crew and barely let my husband get his lawn mower from the garage. We tried contacting them several times about it, but they never responded until they sent a $2500 bill. They also refused to do the pre-walk out which was promised in the form we signed.
If you expect anyone from tricon to care about you in the slightest, look elsewhere.< /Review>

Their Sacramento office has some of the friendliest staff and managers, Jackie, Shonda and Chris they go out of their way to get us moving with fast approvals, I highly recommend Tricon, if I was to rent a house to live in,  they would be my top choice.

<review>I live in Charlotte, NC. Their renting prices are very reasonable and pets are allowed. BUT, insect control is the residents responsibility, so is lawn care and maintenance. When our AC went out (in the summer) it look them 2 weeks to fix it. Now I have black mold in my bathroom, called to get it fixed, they said they would be there the next day between 8-12. Took time off of work for this, by 12:15 no one had arrived OR called. Had to call THEM for them to tell me the technician was too busy and would have to come another day. It is BLACK MOLD, not a leaky sink. They would NOT move anything around for me and told me I would have to wait another day, take another half day off of work, spend another 4 hours of my life hoping they will be here on time. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Their maintenance system is so messed up. And if you do rent from them, pray nothing goes wrong, because good luck getting it resolved.<//review>< Name>

<Review>I cannot stress enough.. do yourself a favor, and steer clear from any Tricon American homes properties. Ever since we’ve had to be under Tricon American homes we’ve had hurdle after hurdle of all of the things they CANT help with and WONT do. It’s the most impersonal property management I’ve ever dealt with. We did have some help and great customer service once or twice after having to complain heavily but that was obviously short lived... We’ve been loyal tenants for 6 years to this home and have had no issues until switching to Tricon a couple years ago. Been trying our hardest to get out of this residency ever since, which they don't make very easy. You never speak to the same person, inconsistent answers, very cold responses. They literally HOUND (I’m talking daily) you months and MONTHS in advance for expiring leases.. it’s especially stressful when you’re in the position of trying to buy a home. Their unwillingness to work with you on literally anything makes everything that much more difficult. The added stress we've been under since being forced under Tricon is beyond anything we can explain. Again, go with literally ANY other property management company!<//Review>< rate>

Laetitia was amazing. Always available and easy to access for my questions and concerns. Sooo helpful. If the application process had gone as smoothly as dealing with her had been, then I would have given 5 stars. Just make sure when you apply you call the leasing center to make sure they use the proper information, even if you triple checked it firsr.< /text>

Today I went to pick up my keys for my rental from Deven Jeffries. He was outstanding! He already had someone there fixing a window and the person already fixed the fan in the bathroom before I even got there!  He went through the entire house thoroughly and graciously answered my questions. He was very kind and the house was beautiful and spotless!<//text>

<review>This is a review regarding my experience with Janet and Jonathan from Tricon (maintenance) on 12/16/19.

Recently, we had an appliance go out and once I submitted my work order, I received a call from Janet that she would have a technician out asap. Within an hour, Jonathan contacted me to let me know that he was on his way and wanted to make sure I was home. Once he arrived, he alerted me that I have cash laying out on the counter. I personally didn't think anything of it, but he wanted me to know that he saw it and would have taken a picture of it had I not been home. Jonathan communicated every step, respected my home by wearing booties, fixed our appliance, and cleaned up his work area. It was almost like he never came. :)

Once the work order was completed, he provided me with detailed instructions and let me know that if I needed anything else, to contact him. Janet made sure to follow up with me to make sure everything was handled professionally and correctly. I personally want to thank them both for handling this (dish washer) especially during a winter storm warning. It wasn't an emergency, but anyone who has ever had a dish washer malfunction and had to hand wash....it feels like an emergency. LOL.

Thanks again Tricon Team!

Joke of a company. They only reply to people looking for a house. Once you sign your lease you better hope you can go a year without needing anyone who works for this company.
I've had hot water issues
Dripping faucet
Broken pipes
Dead garbage disposal
All these issues I've had to fix myself.

Also have had fees and charges tacked on to my rent.  My so called property manager refuses to respond to calls or emails. I get charged with an additional late fee because I emailed my manager 3 weeks before rent was due about the billing errors which she waits until after the rent deadline to get back to me. Coincidence? I dont think so.

Now I get an email stating this is my "FINAL WARNING" .. more like my only warning and now I'm gonna be charged for not having renters insurance. I bought a year policy when I first moved in. Now again she wont respond to me and according to her email I'll be charged an additional 25 dollars a month for insurance that only covers the home and nothing inside.

Again this company is a joke. Run! Find another property company especially if you are in Arizona. The Tricon group out here is a JOKE.< /Text>

Edward Clear came to do maintenance with our home and it was a great experience. He was very kind, he showed up when he said he would and he fixed everything quickly.

I have had such a good experience with Tricon homes since living here, they really care about there tenants and they move quick whenever there is an issue.<//text>

I had the worse experience ever with certain people in the maintenance department here recently but thanks to Grady Jackson he turn that frown upside down. He works in a totally different department but was the only person I spoke with on a consistent basis in order to brings a solution to a 2 month on going issue so to him I say thank you. This experience has really taught me that documentation is everything.< /Review>

I would like to acknowledge a very special ‘germ’ with in there company, Taryn Stewart. She was extremely helpful in to me during my transition from tx to ga. She was always Available to answer any questions I have prior to my move in and moving forward. I had several questions prior to  moving from state to state and I just didn’t know what to expect. But Taryn was there to walk me through the process made me feel at ease . I really really am great Gil for her help.
As for the property in general, it was exactly what I viewed on there site, Outside of some minor repairs. Overall great experience thus far.< /review>

I have been renting from Tricon since 2013.  They are the best. The office personnel are always do helpful and every month this.old lady has to call them to help me pay my rent.  They have so much pa thence with me and walk me thru it every month.  Maybe someday I will do it on my own.  The Maintenance Dept is fantastic.  Every time I have a need they are in within the day and do the job right the firs t time.  I would recommend Tricon America to anyone looking to rent.  They are friendly, useful to renters and always very polite.  It's my pleasure to be renting from them.< /review>

Kevin and Josh were great. They were both very efficient and nice throughout our move in process. Kevin made follow up calls to ensure any issues I had in the house had been corrected. Everything was done in a timely fashion and he was very courteous. I appreciate all of his hard work and effort.< /Text>

Tricon Homes did an excellent job of getting me
Into the prefect home for my family and I. Rodney the move inspector went above and beyond to help get me moved on as well as Susan Lopez and Denise Bledsoe. They all worked together so well and so quickly. I highly recommend!! Thanks so much Tricon!!

After accepting a job in a different part of the state - selling my home of 20+ years and trying to navigate finding a rental home quickly that allowed multiple pets it was clear to me that Tricon American Homes was by far the easiest company to deal with when trying to find a decent multi pet friendly rental property. The home I have been in now for several years is by far the nicest of the pet friendly rentals that I looked at during my search. While I do believe for the price in rent they should provide more services, such as yard maintenance, annual inspections etc., I do realize that may be expecting too much!  This is a nationwide company and being as it is a large corporate, I do wish they would consider offering some sort of rent reductions for signing up for automatic rent payments and/or for multi-year tenants, instead of raising the rent every year on the people that do want to be in their homes, but again I do realize that this is not how things work, just throwing it out there!</text>

Recently moved into our place and love it. Had a few things in the house that needed adjusted, but all was taken care of quickly and professionally. From receiving a response quickly after raising concern, to the maintenance guy Jonathan coming first thing the next morning and fixing everything on the spot.</review>

They are scammers and will lie to you and tell you anything to get you to put a $350.00 application and holding fee. Most other rental agencies charge only $45.00 for this. Then when you try to view or ask questions about the house, they will tell you "you should just sign." Tiffany Salyer is the portfolio manager over Texas and will not return any calls even though she is the sole decision maker on any lease extensions, etc. When I finally got a hold of her, she was dropping F bombs at what sounded like children while I was trying to tell her about my situation/problem.

Tricon has been the absolute best leasing company I have ever leased from.  I’ve currently been with Tricon for almost two years. The home is perfectly suited for me and the Tricon Leasing Team addresses every issue or concern I may have ever had within hours..... literally.  Philip Picard is my maintenance tech and comes and has assisted in all work request which have been minor things that can go wrong.  Their process is seamless.  Maria and Kelly Ackerman is my leasing  agent and has always been kind and compassionate.  Answering all my questions and concerns especially during COVID19 situation. I endorse Tricon and encourage anyone to entertain the the thought of leasing with this company.  I have nothing but positive things to say.  No bad experience at all in the entire time of being in my leased property. I plan to renew again.

Thank you Tricon for all you do!!!!!</text>

Make sure you want the place for sure before you even consider applying to one of their homes. They have a clause that states there is a $250 holding fee IN ADDITION to your application fees. They say if you are denied, you get refunded the fee. But if you are approved and choose not to move in, you are not refunded.

In our situation (4 roommates total), it was $50 for each app and then that holding fee. It wasn't even an hour (if that) after we applied that we seemed to have been auto accepted. BUT we had been applying to other places as well, and of course we decided to go with a better house that accepted us shortly after.

The thing I have a problem with is that they seemed to have AUTO accepted us. They didn't even have any proof of income from us or anything else of that nature. Guess why they did that? So they wouldn't have to give back that extra $250 if we decided to decline their approval. $250 goes a long way when you're as young as we are. Every penny counts, and that was a really shady way to do business. I don't mind losing application fees. Those are a given. But don't auto-approve people like that with NO proof of income or credit just to get your greedy paws on an extra $250. Bad business.</text>

Thank you for your residency with us and we look forward to the next opportunity to serve you in excellence.'}<//Resp><text>*Update: A Tricon corporate representative called a hour within this review and virtually fixed my account immediately. The representative Janet was extremely apologetic and very pleasant she communicated via email through each step.. She left me with contact if I ever have future issues... That's was definitely a A+ experience. I am thankful.

Customer service is very bad.. I've been in my home 7 yrs.. I've never had service issues prior to Tricon taking over.... Friday I was suppose to get a call back and did not, Saturday I was suppose to get a call Monday and have not. Meanwhile They've added $75 for insurance when my renters policy is 7 years old and they were sent the update with them as 3rd party 3 times. Today I emailed the "account manager" and called and was on hold 30 minutes, then answering machine came on to leave a message. So I'm forced to pay for something that is not needed because you cannot change their payment amount when making a payment..< /text><Rate>5</Rate>< gmap_id>

<text>I rented from tricon for almost five years with no issues. I gave my notice to vacate right before the covid 19 drama started. With the pandemic going on I asked for a 30 day extension, they were nice enough to agree and I paid the full 30 days rent. I was ready and able to move out at month end but was asked to stay an extra 8 days since a technician was unavailable until then. I agreed, but upon logging on to the resident portal I found that I had a balance for the extra 8 days. I emailed Denise Bledsoe and she responded that I was responsible for the charges. I didn't ask for the extra 8 days so I called and emailed to no response. I received my security deposit balance in the mail and they charged me the almost $500 for the 8 days I didn't ask for!! In the middle of a pandemic!! Unprofessional and unsympathetic. Do not rent from them.

UPDATE 6/17/2020:
I was contacted by Claudia. She listened to my concerns and explained how their system worked. Although I am disappointed it took a google review to rectify the situation, it was resolved and I was refunded the balance.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Horrible is all I can say.  I applied for a house and gave them $340.00 upfront.  They called and said I was approved.  It was not a true approval.  It was a conditional approval with the terms of.  IF I would pay a larger deposit than the normal one months rent then they would let me move in.  Then said they needed $3600.00 which was the deposit and the first months rent to move forward and I had 48 hrs to pay or lose my $340.00.  They said they would give me 5 days to pay it all or I would forfeit the $340.00 I was never given the option to pay just the deposit then the first months rent 14 days later.  They said they don't do move ins on the weekend.  The agent made NO effort to offer any good customer service.  I understand the market is good for the Tricon because more people are looking for houses in the area than are available.  They canceled my contract after 48hrs and kept my $340.00. I have already been approved with another company and am glad I didn't move into one of Tricon's properties.   I will never deal with them again.</Review>

I just got my keys to my house today, but everything thus far has been so great with Tricon! My portfolio manager, Matt McDonnell, has been extremely quick at answering a million questions I’ve had.

Incredible service provided by Kim Manell! She's very knowledgeable about what the property needs when it needs to be turned over and I'd recommend anyone to use this company for their next home.

I don't know where these reviews are coming from, I think their being made up because this company is far from what is being said in these reviews, their quick to evict but repairs are patched work, sometime months to have things done. And the homes on the website are all photo shop because they never look that good when you get there. So don't believe what's in these reviews!</Text>

The whole process was awesome, the turn around time was ever better. The good things I can say about Tricon, If you have any issues they will take care of any situation right away. I only had the opportunity to meet two employees at Tricon in person, because mostly everyone one else was by phone ,The Two people I meet was Mrs. Ruby Baker, And Wendy Fabel , Who are extremely awesome. Anytime you call or whenever you need anything. These two ladies will go above and beyond to help. I never had any issues with returning phone calls, no matter how many times they will always give you a call back. I recently moved . But I can honestly say, they were the best company I ever rented from. Ruby Baker is so awesome I love her patience, she’s  always willing to point me to the right point of contact and never seem like she is bothered in no way. If u are looking for a place Tricon is we’re u want to start your search. You will not be disappointed.< /review>

<Review>This has been a stressful couple of days trying to rent a home from this company. They charge 50 dollars per applicant plus a 250 fee for "holding the place to review" your app. I never spoke with the same person when I called. I only spoke with the agent once. Her responses were short and she never got back with me about a  "required quiz" I was supposed to take (that would not open at all). They request info that I uploaded multiple times. Such a headache. It seem like they are scamming people out of nonrefundable 50 dollar application fees and nonrefundable 250 dollar holding fees....Beware when Applying with this company<//Review></record>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>My family and I have lived in a home rented from Tricon since November 2017. Since then we've made 10 requests to have someone come and "fix" the plumbing. Several times raw sewage has flowed up from under our toilets and flooded our bathroom, come up out of our sinks, and in our bathtubs. Every time someone comes out to look at the issue, they tell us that the plumbing looks like it was put in incorrectly to begin with. Out of the multiple times they've had someone come look at it, only once has someone tried to correct the plumbing underneath the house. November 2018 a plumber came out to dig up our yard and bathroom in an attempt to repair long term damage. Last night it stormed and my entire bathroom was flooded with raw sewage yet again. Tricon had someone come out to look at it today, he told me that the last person who came out did not fix what was initially wrong with the pipes. There are broken pipes under our home, which is causing massive amounts of water leakage and will cause the foundation to ruin. We signed another lease in 2018 - big mistake. The person who came to look at our home today said they would have to contact the last vendor that Tricon sent and that there was nothing he could do. That we wouldn't be able to flush solids in our toilets. He also notified me that because of the pipes being broken and never fixed that all of our sewage was flowing into the front of our home. Meaning everything we flush goes in our front yard. This is not just a small repair. This is a health issue that was not remedied before having a family move in. This isn't only affecting us, but will eventually affect our neighbors who own the homes next to us. The people who represent Tricon have been unprofessional and rude. We've had people hang up on us, tell us that it's past 5pm and try to get us off the phone, refuse to give us their name in order to complain to HR, refuse to give us a corporate number, and have had managers decline our request to speak with them about this public health problem. We are looking for reimbursement for the supplies and ruined towels we've had to use over the months in order to clean up all of this sewage. We're also seeking to be compensated in order to find another home to live in - as this is violating our rights as tenants (under Texas state law).< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1557152110955, 'text': 'Thank you for your review.

<Review>Charlotte, NC. Tricon has been helpful, responds quickly to any questions or issues, and is perfectly professional! The move in process was smooth and comfortable. I have been with many rental companies in the past due to moving for work and Tricon is by far my favorite. 100% recommend.< /Review><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133</gmap_id><username>Leah Whitt</username><date>1563624482652<//date><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

So far our experience has been wonderful. Kevin was incredibly helpful with answering all of our questions and did an excellent job showing us how everything worked around the house. The leasing process was easy and quick. We are very pleased with our home and look forward to spending our time here.< /Text>

Our power went out , and though the technician from Duke arrived and troubleshooted our issue and got the power back on, it was found that the power panel had some issues. We reported it to Tricon Maintenance and they sent someone within 24 hours.  When the issue was verified, they ordered a new panel and a few days later on a Saturday, the tech arrived to put in a new power panel on a Saturday, so as to not affect our lives too much (he had to turn off the power for a couple of hours). He performed the service rapidly, explained what he was doing and cleaned up the job, completing it ahead of the estimation.  Since it was a hot day, we were very grateful to have the power and a/c back on.  We ARE VERY PLEASED THAT TRICON HAS BEEN SO RESPONSIVE AND QUICK TO MAKE NECESSARY REPAIRS! And we love our house!<//Text>

If you are looking for home then you have found the place. This company was patient , kind, and very helpful. My leasing agent Kalisha Holt, was so helpful and kind. I really just knew I got on her nerves, but no she made me feel welcomed, and was always helpful no matter what. She is very caring and really cares about her customers. Shanna was kind to. Jessica Mark's ,my manager is a lovely lady to work with. Her personality is so peachy , and you can tell she is eager to help you, and she is also available when you need her. My move in process was so efficient and not rushed. Mr. Bill Sutton took his time, and answered all of my questions... even to the end. He also made me feel comfortable if I had more questions and offered that. I would give more stars if I could. I could not have asked for a better experience. All of the people who helped me over the phone were also always pleasant.  I am happy I am apart of Tricon American Homes were all of their staff I came across genuinely cares , and are great at their jobs.

Thank you< /text>

<text>02/01/21 BEWARE NUMBER 2 THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR EXPENSES ALONG WITH YOUR RENT WITHOUT EVEN CONTACT YOU TO ADVISE EXAMPLE I HAVE HAD RENTERS INSURANCE SINCE I MOVED INTO THE RESIDENCE AND MY HOMEOWNERS SHOWS THIER NAME ON MY POLICY BUT THEY ARE CHOOSING TO CHARGE ME ADDITIONAL TO PAY FOR THIER COMPANY HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE.  I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANY RENTAL PROPERTY REQUIRING TO PURCHASE 2 HOMEOWNERS POLICY

Another Note Renters BEWARE
This company is the worst company to rent from for the following reasons:
Rental increases with no notification of amounts up to 70 to even more.
They lose information from move in so make sure you take video of move and representative that moves you in.  They change staff like no other.
The maintenance on the homes is mostly caulking and the least expensive materials and the worst repairs,  They amend your rental contracts at their convenience.  BEWARE</text>< time>

Yolanda and her team were extremely helpful with my move-in process.  They went above and beyond to ensure my application was approved quickly and move-in was done in record time.  I applied on a Friday at noon and by Monday morning at 11 a.m, I was approved. A move-in process that normally takes 4 days they were able to get done for me in less than 24 hours.  I also want to thank Sarah for accommodating me to meet early in the morning to get the move-in completed and waiting for me through the rain storm.  All I can judge I can is my move in and that was awesome.  I will keep you updated on my relationship with Tricon!</text>

Latoshia Bates is heaven sent! From the application to move-in date, she made the process easy. If I had any questions she always called or emailed me back in less than 5 minutes. I am very impressed by her customer service skills!  She really made my moving experience awesome.

While waiting to move in Mr. Henry Gamble pulled up in the Tricon Van and I wanted to cry. I was moving into my first rental home. He also was very informative and  went over everything I needed to know about the house. I was able to get my keys after obtaining a wealth of knowledge about the property and it's interior amenities.

Overall Tricon American Homes is a great leasing company.  Their state-of the art 21st century technological set up was the main reason why I chose to  lease our first home with this company. I appreciated being able to tour the home on my own schedule with their self-tour option and the website is phenomenal. It has great pictures, floor-plans and 360 viewing.  I was able to view the homes online as if I was there in person.  Keep up the great work Tricon American Homes !< /Review>

<review>Victor definitely gets five stars. He was absolutely wonderful, helped us with a faulty dishwasher and even installed a faucet that we had bought and planned on installing ourselves. He was there the day of our move in too, working incredibly hard to make sure our home was ready, and for that we appreciate him. I still can't recommend Tricon, as the leasing experience was absolutely terrible, the property manager is unreachable, and one of the agents hung up on me, but Victor and the rest of the maintenance team have been the best part of this whole experience, and this review is mainly for them. Victor does great work!<//review>< Gmap_id>

This is review is submitted to recognize not only the management company Tricon American Homes but the people who “truly make the company tick.” I’ve been a resident with Tricon for over 2 years now and I can truly say I appreciate one particular staff member in Texas named Ms. L. Moore.  She is always professional  and very responsive to my needs as a valued resident. She truly makes a difference in the Tricon brand and makes me feel like a priority as a resident.  She a great asset and a phenomenal account manager. So far, I’ve had wonderful experience and I am recommending Tricon for everyone who wants to rent a home! She clearly wants the tenants to be happy. I personally recommend this company due to the staffing alone and the awesome Ms. L Moore.<//review>

<review>I’ve been renting with Tricon for almost 6 years, and I will be renting with them for a Long time.
They always answers my maintenance request fast. And help me with all the issues we normally have at home. But especially in this time is when I have more respect for them, my Family is passing through a super difficult time and them, specially Tiffany Farnham did everything and more to help us. I will be forever grateful for that. Also their costumer service is top notch. Living in Las Vegas and with all the people moving from another states, Tricon still manages to have the best rent prices for their homes.
So, if you are thinking in renting, please consider Tricon.
Happy tenant Here!♥️< /review>< Rate>

<Text>My experience will Tricon Homes has been nothing less but the best! Dawn, Leasing Specialist, went beyond and above to ensure a smooth process to renew my lease. She helped me to make an informed decision to renew my lease with Tricon. I was so impressed with her professionalism and concern for me and family that I renewed a two-year lease. I have truly enjoyed living in Tricon Homes and until I decide to purchase a home, Tricon Homes will be my residency. Thank you Tricon Homes for really caring for your residents and employing absolutely great staff.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Always had a pleasant experience when dealing with the company.  Everyone is so professional and willing to help, especially when it comes to work orders. I get a call back the same day placed and an appointment the very next day.  Today Jeff Picard came out and completed a work order.  He did an awesome job!</Text>< pictures>

Smooth and simple process. Once we found the prefect home it took 48 hours for paperwork to be completed and we received the keys. Everyone we dealt with was very friendly.<//Review>

<Review>Really great company to rely on! I found the perfect home for our family and needed to move in right of way and they made the process quick and simple, the Leasing Agent Laetita was very helpful and kind. Then the Superintendent Sam went out of his way to ensure we had everything we needed on point for us to be able to move same day, and gave us his personal phone number to contact him any time! Very impressed with the service and very happy in our new home! Thank you!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_name>Eliana Ritchie<//user_name><user_id>117711617076495726387< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

If your air conditioner goes out on a Saturday don’t expected to get a call to get it fixed until the office opens up. I have a 3 year old who had to suffer threw the heat because no one would answer the phone or maintenance request. This is horrible it is 89 degrees in our home and no one contacted me after putting in 3 requested. Tricon America homes needs a better system on maintenance request and emergency maintenance request.<//Text>

Shawn Patton, is the representative that we met today when we moved into our new home with Tricon American Homes. All we can say was not only was he on time, but he was early and was able to start our moving process efficiently. He fixed all the appliances and concerns we addressed. Coming from our home where we were before, we are elated by this first experience to start our new journey here in our new home. He represents his profession with high standards!!! Thanks Mr. Patton.

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Me and my boyfriend rented a house in a OK neighborhood. They were very helpful in the beginning making sure all paperwork was complete. When we did the walk thru we noticed there was a closet for a stackable washer. I had asked them about that gas or electric they said both work they just need to be stackable. I sold my other washer and dryer to get a stackable to find out it doesn't fit. After I call they send someone to check the closet that's when they say it has to a specific size. Never once did they say anything about the size. Now my washer and dryer are hanging out in the hallway which is a small hallway mind you and they have not done anything to address my concerns.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1589999496220, 'text': 'Priscilla, thank you for taking the time to provide your honest feedback.

Daphne Hall is the best portfolio manager I have ever worked with. We are a military family and have had many rental homes with many sub par managers and she exceeds expectations tenfold. She was very helpful and kind with all our questions. She is also very quick to respond to emails and give you a phone call if needed. We have never had a portfolio manager that was actually proactive. We are very excited to start our new journey in San Antonio living in a Tricon American Home.<//Text>

I would like to express my impression of the service that was provided to me in my search for a new rental home. Tricon ( with the help of  Latoshia Bates in particular) was very courteous,  efficient and professional in finding me a home with my specifications in mind. I would recommend the company to all that may read this.

Thank you

Shanna has been great.  From when we first made contact about the property to the move in process to now being in our second month living here she has always been responsive, friendly, and thorough.  Not to mention she left us a homemade move in gift in our fridge.  Suffice to say that she is a phenomenal baker!</text>

Talk about southern charm, Kevin and TJ are the perfect examples. They made the best impression on my mom and I being we were just relocating from GA to NC. Everything was explained and shown to us in great detail and we didn't feel as if there was no question we couldn't ask. We are loving our new Tricon home and our new state.< /review>

Tricon American Homes has been an exceptional agency to rent from. Customer service is first rate. All maintenance requests are dealt with in a expeditious manner. The website is user friendly and they respond personally to any issues that come up with your account or home. 10/10 would rent with this company again in the future.<//Review>

Had a septic issue with the home I am renting. Tricon was quick to get in touch with me after submitting a maitanince request. Danny Munoz has been helping the whole time keeping well informed letting me know the next step all along the way. But unfortunately replacing the septic system is a lengthy process pulling permits with the city but Danny has done every to expedite the process and take care of my family. Great company to rent from very helpful and understanding.<//review>

It has almost been a year since myself and my family have signed on with Tricon. Although it has been a little rocky throughout,
Ms. Shadee Livingston has completely turned that around for us. With her caring and professional way of handling things, we finally don’t feel like we’re just “another tenant”.
She has been more then helpful during our time with Tricon.<//Text>

Today was the first day in 2 years that I was extremely irritated with Tricon. I absolutely loved the staff, all of my issues got corrected immediately. I had no issues with Tricon. My friend was a renter and she was called and informed that she owed a balance, that she did not owe. Today that happened to me! I have never been late nor do I owe anything to them. I was told that they would have to research and would call me back. I am upset. The research should be done before these balances are added. I don't want to wait, I want answers now. The woman that I spoke to seemed more irritated with me than I was with her and this whole system.

Update..... I was called and told that my account had been corrected. Well I went online to pay my rent and it is not correct! Things are definitely not the same with these new people. :(< /Text>

<text>I am a new tenant with Tricon and I must say my experience from approval to move-in was seamless. Michelle Harris the Assistant Property Manager was awesome. I had a ton of questions and she never once got ill with me which I greatly appreciate.

Move-in day was also great. David K was AWESOME!!!! He gave me a lot perspective which I greatly appreciate. He took a ton a pictures to make sure everything was documented on move-in condition. There were things that he saw that I didn't even catch but he made sure to let me know and to document them. I had some maintenance requests during move-in and those were handled very promptly.

Since I have been in the home I have had a couple more maintenance requests and I have been contacted about them very promptly.

If I had to rent through Tricon again tomorrow I would based on the excellent service I have received thus far.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1528133750188, 'text': 'Ms. Jones, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

<Text>DON'T RENT FROM THEM.
Our neighbor is living in one of their properties. A few years ago, the neighbors called the company to have our mutual fence replaced. It's a 40 year old fence, that was being held together by a nail and a prayer. It took the company weeks to return a call, and finally send someone out. They propped up their sides with 1 board, and called it "fine".
Fast forward to a month ago. We decided to remove some ivy from the tree in our backyard, and some of it was attached to the fence. Needless to say, the whole fence started coming apart. Boards dropping, poles falling out of holes, etc.  We got ahold of the neighbor who gave us Tricon's information. So we and the neighbor who rents from them called them to let them know we needed to put up a new fence. Over a week went by, we tried emailing, and....nothing. The neighbor has a dog, and so we HAD to replace the fence asap. We found someone to do it, for a very reasonable price.
We have since contacted Tricon MULTIPLE times, and they are refusing to pay their half stating that its because they didn't use "their contractor"
We would have be fine using "their" person, but the company never got back to us to set up a time, and it had to be done.
I can't believe the lack of professionalism from this company.
If you are local, you are waaaaay better off renting from Solano Property Management.<//Text>< Pictures>

I was originally told when I showed interest in one of their properties that they only process applications one at a time, so if I was interested in a property that someone already applied and paid the holding fee for, I would just be added to a waitlist, and if they were denied, the home would go back on the market and I would be able to apply and pay the holding fee. They said that if someone else has applied/paid the holding fee, IT WILL REMOVE THE HOME OFF THE MARKET AND THAT'S WHY I WOULD BE ADDED TO A WAITLIST. Keep that in mind....Well, I went to their website and looked up the home--still showed available, so I went through the entire application process. At the end it required me pay the $250 holding fee on top of the $50 app fees for both my husband and I, so I figured "Oh ok, no one has applied or paid the holding fee and been approved yet...it's still available, yay!". Literally within a matter of 20-30 minutes of them taking $350 from me, I received this email: Dear Kylie, We are pleased to announce that your application for (house I applied for) has been approved pending ID and income verification. Once our team successfully confirms your uploaded proof of identification and income, you will receive an official approval email with instructions on how to proceed through lease signing. We look forward to serving you as our resident. Sincerely, Tricon American Homes--All the email says that's "pending" is ID AND INCOME VERIFICATION. Other than that, they said we were APPROVED, and that they LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING US AS THEIR RESIDENT. That means we got the house don't you think??? Keep that in mind now. So fast forward to the next day, I can't remember at this point if they called me to inform me about the other applicant, or if I originally called them first to check the status of the pending ID and income verification, but regardless of who called who first, that's when I was informed of another applicant for the same home. I was told that they only had until the next day (you have only 48 hours after being approved to pay the security deposit and sign the lease, etc) to send in documentation and sign their lease, and if they didn't, the home was ours. This is where I started to get confused. If there was another applicant that was about to sign a freaking lease, WHY WAS I CHARGED ANYTHING, ESPECIALLY A HOLDING FEE?! If someone else applied and was that close to approval, that means THEY would've paid the holding fee, which should then have made the home UNAVAILABLE TO OTHER APPLICANTS! Am I right, or am I just crazy?? And on top of all that, WHY WOULD YOU SAY I'M APPROVED FOR A HOME WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE ANOTHER APPLICANT AHEAD OF ME WAITING TO SIGN A LEASE?????? NONE of it makes sense to me. Well fast forward a couple of hours, and sure enough that other applicant came through and was approved and somehow my approval email was a lie? I was told THAT DAY (4/8/2020) that my holding fee was refunded. I have all of that in a text still. I was told that as far as when the refund would hit my bank account depended on the bank, so I figured maybe a day or two and I would have my refund back. Nope. Fast forward to Tuesday 4/14/2020, still no refund. I call my bank and ask how long refunds usually take. They said usually 3 business days. Well at this point it had been 4 business days. So I texted the rep at Tricon to find out if and when my refund was really sent. That's when I was told, "It wasn't until Thursday (4/9/2020) that they submitted according to the notes.) So instead of getting mad, I just said ok thank you and expected it to hit my bank the next day. Wrong again. It is now 4/16/2020, 6 business days (8 calendar days) since I was originally charged and told I was being refunded my money that I should've NEVER been charged to begin with, so I texted yet again to find out where it's at. I was told, "The refund has been requested in the full amount of $349.98 for your application number * just got all this emailed back this am."  REQUESTED?? WHERE'S MY DAMN MONEY?!?!</Text></record>

This company is an utter scam. They put you through verification with their Vendor and if you don't remember a phone number you had five yrs ago, they'll fail you and keep your money. And, the only 'viable' option they say they can offer you is for you to re-apply pay the money all over again, so they can take more money from you. This is an unbelievably sub-standard business practice. I'm so distraught - SAVE YOUR TIME & MONEY!</review>

I absolutely love being a part of the Tricon family. Everything from the viewing process to being a current resident has always been such a breeze.

I had been a home owner for many years but decided to rent in Florida. Having not rented any property since college I was quite concerned that it would be difficult for me and my family, but Tricon has been great to work with. They always respond when I need them and the staff and contractors that they send out have been amazing!!</Text>

< review>
I would really only like to give 1 star but I giving 2 stars because the house itself was fine. However, the experience of dealing with their portfolio managers and customer service is excruciating and negative. My first issue occurred when I renewed my lease and I had to add a new auto draft for the new amount. I cancelled my old auto draft, but when the 1st rolled around, both amounts were debited and when I contacted them, they stated there was nothing they could do and I had to do a stop pay. So I did this. Then I was informed that I had the 6 day grace period to repay. Once my money was returned to my account, I paid on day 5 of the grace. That didn't stop Tricon from charging me a NSF and a late fee. I had to fight and call constantly (portfolio managers and call center) to get a resolution of the charges being reversed. I have recently not renewed and moved out. Now I have submitted a dispute for the move out statement but *surprise, surprise* I have received no response to my dispute. Once again, I'm having to call repeatedly in the hopes that someone will reply. AVOID TRICON AT ALL COSTS!<//review>

Unfortunately were almost not able to view the property until we started to leave and noticed work van that represents the property and the gentleman was so laid back and cool he got in contact with his company and asked if we could wait about 15 minutes and he'll help us get in to view this home...Long story short thanks to everyone who was involved in going above and beyond for me and my husband Today..Thank you</Text>< user>

<Review>I have been in a Tricon home for a week and 2 days now. My experience with Tricon so far has been nothing short of amazing. I am glad I made the decision to rent from Tricon. The process was very simple and any snags along the way someone was there to help. I would refer this company to anyone looking to rent.<//Review></record>

If I could leave a 0 star review, I would. Dana Keys was our property manager while residing at the property. I signed a 18 month lease and after 14 months, I had to move. I had nothing but problems and trying to get a hold of Dana was a nightmare. She would never return calls or emails. After getting rude because nothing was being done, Dana would finally reach out to you but by email only. It’s like she never wanted to talk to a customer over the phone. So, when we broke our lease and moved out, we were told that we would get a full refund back for our deposit within no more than 45 days of move out. After the 45 days were up, I still didn’t get my deposit mailed to me. I did give Dana Keys our forwarding address multiple times by the way. I call to see where our money is and they say it’s been mailed out already and we should get it anytime. A week goes by and still no check. I call and Tricon says 30 business days to get the check. Ok guys, now it’s been 37 business days since I broke my lease. Tricon today says up to 45 business days. I have an email by the grace of god from Dana stating on February 27th. Our check was mailed. Here we Are on the 9th of March and still no check even though we were told via email from Dana the property manager, it was mailed on the 27th of February. I am still waiting to get a callback from our old property manager which I know will never happen to figure out why all this line is going on and where my deposit check is. People, I would never ever ever recommend Tricon American homes. They lie about everything and are terrible with their renters and never get anything done or return phone calls.<//Text>

I'm currently renting a home from Tricon in the Atlanta area and I love it. From the start till now after being in the home for over a month they still make sure we are doing well. Brandi C. helped us find the perfect home. She really heard all of our requests and did not stop until she found the house that we could make our home. Cordierro R. made sure we had all the information needed to make doing the paperwork seamless and easy. Candice B. and Brian T. made sure all issues were resolved before we moved into the home. Thanks to all their hard work we have settled into our new home and are loving it!!!</Text>

<review>Ive recently returned to LasVegas and needed a home to move into right away, some friends had mentioned what a great company Tricon American Homes was and the great experience they had. I wasnt particularly looking for this company immediately I just wanted a good rental at a decent price, I visited quite a few other homes and wasnt having any luck until I found the home and area I knew I had to be in.  I came to the open house and was told by the agent Monica that this was a Tricon American Home, I left immediately after a quick walk through and put in my application,  everything was so easy and any questions I had I called the phone number provided and had help every step of the way, I probably called 10x before I was completely done, every single call was pleasant and incredibly professional.  I have had the best experience with this company and am forever grateful of their services. Theyve helped make my transition a better easier and comforting experience.  Thank you to every single person that I spoke with and have met thus far.  Roberta< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>After 8 years, we had to move. Our landlord decided he wanted to move to Vegas and live in his house instead of renting it out. We found a house which was a Tricon home. I was pleased that every touch point with Tricon went perfectly. Their website is way above average. I had a little trouble and called their support line. They picked up on the SECOND ring and resolved my issue within two minutes. Now THAT’S service!  I was assigned a new resident representative who handled all my questions and really held my hand. I have been in my current house for 8 years, 12 years in the house before that and 12 years in the house before that. Based on all the above, I’m looking forward to many years in my new Tricon home.</Review><Time>1554139572465</Time><Gmap_id>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133<//Gmap_id><user>101805991820324035856</user></record>

<Review>This company will swindle you out of any dime they can and break the law while they are doing it. Watch them closely. Don't let the 5 star reviews fool you. They are employees and friends giving those reviews. They hung up on me when they knew they were caught. Get a attorney before leaving residence.<//Review>< user>

<Text>We began our rental lease with Tricon a week ago and our experience so far has been nothing short of amazing. The application, approval, and move in processes were all quick and seamless. Our leasing agent, Brian, has been great, remaining available for all of our questions and concerns and he has been helpful during our first week as residents. On move-in day we met with the maintenance manager Michael who took note of any maintenance concerns and had a mechanic out to make repairs the very next day. We had a problem with our garage door openers and the maintenance coordinators reached out within 24 hours and were flexible with scheduling. We also LOVE that everything is done online using an easy-to-navigate online resident portal. We can pay rent and make maintenance requests quickly, all from our mobile devices. We would highly recommend Tricon to anyone looking to rent.</Text>< Rate>

We were a little worried with the initial response time prior to signing a release with people involved, but once we found Tiffany the experience immediately took a amazing turn. She was very helpful in all questions and quick to respond on everything needed. Zach, our maintenance tech was amazing, very informative, quick to make repairs upon move in and extremely easy to get ahold of. The only reason for the deduct in star was due to it taking so long to get a response prior to lease approval and signing.<//review>

<Review>I recently moved into a Tricon American Home and as of now I have zero complaints. The move in process with Tricon was lightning fast and not too complicated. The agents I worked (Michelle and Candace) with have been excellent and they are very knowledgeable. The house itself is older, so I did not expect it to be in perfect condition. Everything works as promised and some of the recent renovations seem quite nice.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1547482598664, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to write us a review.

Going through this process with Brian Holzwarth at Tricon has been incredibly insightful. Brian patiently walked me through every step of the leasing process wonderfully and helped me as much as he could to ensure that I was put into my new place as swiftly as possible. I really appreciate all his help and would recommend him to anyone interested in homes with Tricon!! 👌🏼< /review>

John Encarnacion is extremely helpful and professional. This is the second time he has come out to our property to assist us with maintenance requests. We needed our outside lights replaced on our property and even though residents are responsible for those type of things around the home, he still assisted me with replacing them.

I would definitely recommend John to anyone in the area.</Review>

< Review>
This review is not to the company, but to whoever hired the driver in Mini White van July 8 at 8:17 A.M. with license plate KJC 7845 ( I think those were the four numbers, I was driving ). Bottom right of the van says A12. Employee was driving off his lane to different lanes going 80mph+ on speed limit 70 ( on I-20 west bound Fort Worth & I-35 ) because of phone use the entire way. Driver would steer back to own lane only to merge unwillingly and almost hit my car without paying attention. Cars like myself were passing him to avoid a wreck.  A person should not text and drive. Especially when on duty.</Review>

I have lived in my home for over 3 years .  Tricon has really step it up with the quality of customer service The Overall team are providing . Wendy , Jose, the techs. Having  people who care and make sure  myself the resident understand the processes really helps . The follow up and attention to detail  has been great.  I really think that if this level of customer service continue Tricon will really see the benefit.  Thank you Tricon for caring in these hard times . Truly impacting my family in a positive way.</text>

<Review>My experience with Tricon has been nothing but positive so far. They bought our house in November from another national landlord, who was okay, and Tricon made every effort to make the transition as smooth as possible.  We've had trouble with our air conditioner for 3 years and the old landlord just kept servicing it every summer when it was 100 degrees outside. When it went out again a few days ago, an actual customer service representative called me within 30 minutes of me placing my online maintenance request. They had someone out the next day to look at it, and upon his recommendation it was replaced within a few days (and Tricon uses good maintenance people as well).  Very happy.<//Review>< pictures>

Worst customer care. No management (at least none that you can reach out to). Worst renting experience ever. If u pay your rent and are a good tenant you deserve better than this company and almost any company will treat you better. The call center is the best thing about Tricon but they can do absolutely nothing if there is an issue. Only email the people you've already tried to get in touch with.</text>

We have sat outside 2 homes for over an hour and a half to do a self tour through their company. Nobody can help us get in. They just keep sending us to different numbers and different people. If it is this difficult just to view a home I am concerned how difficult they would be to rent from. People from central say they can’t help and give us a different number that sends us right back to someone IN CENTRAL! one number they gave us didn’t even ring and just said “no route.” We scheduled a showing online then it said our face was invalid. I am beyond frustrated.<//text>

My story is so long, I wouldn't know where to start.
I'm giving 2 stars, because approval till move in was ok. However from the day of move in on June 12th, until today I'm dealing with unprofessional and unreliable contractors. It took them 1 month to fix most of my issues,  from sheetrock, to paint, to leaking ceiling, leaking toilets, leaking faucets etc. My house was definitely not "ready move in". Having to miss work, income to wait around on contractors who do not show up on at least 4 occasions.
Depending how this ends, I might consider 3 stars. We'll see.

Update 9/17/18

Looks like I need to edit my stars to 1.
Everyone is blaming each other, no one takes accountability. RUN!</Text>

<Date>1576191909433</Date><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Since moving into my new home with my family, we've had a few minor to moderate maintenance issues. Nothing critical, just little things that slipped under the radar during the final inspection. As an example, the furnace seemed to be working fine, but over long term use, it vacant apparent that it was shutting down earlier than it should. In repairing these issues, I have dealt with the superintendent, Tucker Webb, and maintenance tech, Larenz Suggs. Both gentlemen have been prompt, courteous and professional. Each had explained what they found was wrong, how they planned to correct the issue, thoroughly cleaned up after themselves and made sure I was satisfied before leaving. They have both helped to reinforce that moving into a Tricon American Home was an excellent decision.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133<//GmapID></record>

<Text>Honestly, this is by far the best rental company I have ever used. Putting in an application was a little stressful (but isn't it everywhere) but it was online which made it easier! I have been in my house for 2 months and paying rent is easy, we have had to out in maintenance twice (both for minor things) & each one was taken care of effectively and in a timely manner. We moved to Irmo and when we first moved in a Tricon representative showed us around, made sure we were comfortable before handing over the keys and kept on contact with us for the first month making sure we ran into no issues. Thank you Tricon and Mr.Randy for taking such care of us. We love our new home!<//Text>< pictures>

I applied for a home and also put down a deposit. My application was not accepted. I called the office and customer service told me it would take 3-5 business days for the return of your deposit. Five days past and my deposit had not been returned. I called again and now the customer service said it would take 5-7 business days. Also they would send the lady over in corporate an email to call me. Eight days, still no deposit or phone call. I called again and was told corporate would check into it and call me back. Nine days has now past and I have yet to hear from anyone from corporate. Now I am angry!! You had no problem taking my money and now I continue to get no answers or return phone calls regarding my deposit. So please before you give your money to this company in good FAITH be careful, they are hesitant for whatever reason to return your money. I still have not received my deposit or a return phone call from corporate.</Text>

“Patrick - Charlotte NC” is the BEST EVER! His attention to detail and follow through is second to none. Patrick is a professionals, professional! He is  courteous,  responsive, and gets it done!

I tend not to look for perfection, I look for follow up and follow through. When I arrived at the home there were minor things which needed to to be taken care of; prior to my arrival Patrick had already walked through the property and made provisions for the corrections.

Before, I left the home, workers were walking in to take care of things.

Most impressive: Patrick said, I have a wife and family I take care of homes to meet the approval and standards I have for my family!

Thank you, Patrick!

First impressions are important, and the house was not properly cleaned there was a leak and also a issue with the stoppers in both bathrooms. I was advised it will be fixed returned the next day and only the stoppers were repaired & new thermostat kitchen leak still present. l would like to move into a home that’s ready and repairs completed upon my move in date. I hope this is an oversight and not a common issue. I should’ve read the reviews before moving forward.......

Updated review
My repairs have been completed and hopefully no more to come now I can enjoy living here. The Dallas maintenance manager Jesse reached out to me personally and made sure to get the repairs completed in a timely manner. And I definitely appreciate it. Thank you.

Update December 30,2019
I have been trying to get a leak fixed for three weeks now! Two different companies came out and SAID the repairs were done, when the leak is still present. I had a appointment today and no one ever showed up or called to cancel. I’m sure my closet has mold due to the water leak and smell, Tricon call center is a joke they brush it off as no big deal! At this point I have exhausted all my options with the repairs and will contact my attorney I’ve never paid rent late and just like I pay on time URGENT repairs should be done in a timely manner three weeks is absolutely ridiculous...< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I toured and fell in love with a Tricon home, but didn't apply on time and was waitlisted. I was thrilled when the lease fell through and I was able to secure my dream home! The entire process - from application to keys in hand - happened in one afternoon. The team I worked with were so responsive, cheerful, knowledgeable, and helpful through the process - Maritza Llanos and Juan Flores met me at the home after 5pm, Denise Bledsoe made sure all of my paperwork was in order and approved, and Shelly Clark made sure that the house was ready to go after hours. In a very stressful time, they made things incredibly easy and fun! Thank you!<//Review>< Pics>

We had to move out and live in a hotel for a few weeks. The whole time we were in the hotel we were working with Tricon on a new home and needed our keys to the house quite fast. We have just moved in to our home and i have to say, so far so good and the house is in great condition. I liked how with Tricon, if you fill out your application and put the holding fee down, they DO NOT go around your back and rent it to someone with higher credit or no dogs. They hold the house for you as they give you updates on the application and move in process.< /Review>< Pics>

We love Tricon American Homes. They respond quickly to maintenance requests. Everything we’ve asked to upgrade or repair has been taken care of professionaly and timely. Paying rent is very simple with their Resident portal app. Everyone has been very friendly and helpful.

We highly recommend Tricon American Homes.

<review>James Crawford of the Charlotte, NC location was prompt, called ahead, left for Lowe’s to get special parts and appropriately handled my pest problem on the porch. This is the second time he’s assisted me at my property and has been very helpful both times! I’d highly recommend him and Tricon Homes as a management company.

I want to take this opportunity to tell you, that your company is the fourth management company I have had since moving in to this house and by far you are the best!!  I have always felt completely alone and on my own with this house, but since you guys have taken over I no longer feel that way.  Everyone I have talked to from the customer service people, the pool guy and the maintenance guys and the tree people have just been wonderful.  Everyone is so nice and seems to really care about the well being of myself and my children.   This includes you!!

I also want to let you know that the pool company has been great.  They serviced the pool on the scheduled day after the hurricane and I was amazed how great the pool looked afterward.  The hurricane dumped a lot of dirt in the pool and they got it all out.  They do such a wonderful job every week and the guy is so nice.

Being a single, working Mom with so many stress factors going on in my life right now, I can't begin to tell you how much of a weight I feel has been lifted from my shoulders feeling like I have someone in my corner now.  I can't express to you and your company how grateful I am that all of you have come into our lives.

YOU are GREATLY appreciated!!< /Text>

I have been with tricon American homes for 7 years 1 year when it was called Silver Bay i recommend tricon American homes 2 everyone that I know that is looking for a place to call home the staff members are so so excellent I cannot even put it in words the supervisor Mona Lisa she is the best I had to go and have surgery she actually rest out to me to see how I was doing and how my surgery had went most supervisors that runs a very big company normally do not reach out to the tenants to see how their health is doing but miss Mona Lisa she did that she would always be a part of my family.
And I would like to also say thank you tricon American homes for allowing myself and my family to be part of tricon Americans home family as well<//review>

<Text>From the moment we called about the Tricon American Home that we now call home, the staff was attentive, quick to respond and diligent taking care of every aspect of the rental process. Richard Ventura was very helpful and professional, Matthew Dell always responded in a timely manner to my many questions and as a previous renter this was by far the most painless and enjoyable rental process!< /Text>< Pictures>

This company is the worst. Not only do they have horrible customer service they also don’t care about the tenants. Just want to drain your money out your pockets . They don’t give you parking spaces<//text>

I just ended my lease with tricon last month. They were amazing to work with. We rented site unseen. The house was clean when we arrived. We lived there for about 6 months and broke the lease to move to the house we purchased. They were so nice and accommodating. We did no move in inspection which worried us at first, but on move out they did not charge us for anything. They were always easy to reach. Would definitely use them again if I needed to rent again.< /Text>

Deven Jeffries was awesome! He did our move in and move out! Great personality! We would definitely recommend Tricon to anyone! Thank you so much.

UPDATE:  Deven Jeffries was awesome that wont change! However everything else will! Good luck getting your deposit sent to you. I was told 45 days after move out and it is almost 60 and still no sign. Said they fixed the problem and it needed signatures on Monday. I email for tracking number of check and they said ACCOUNTING hasn't sent it yet, but would provide it when tracking number is generated. Today is Thursday and we are still waiting on Accounting management to sign. This is ridiculous. Of course they want your deposit within 2 days of Applying and getting accepted but I can not even get my check in 45 Days like promised. Quick to take it but sure drag their feet giving it back.<//review>

I'm a plumber and I deal with plenty of property management companies. When I get a call for tricon  I know I'm okay. When I need authorization for something I call Jackie Salas and she is always available, and i can tell she loves her job. Thanks for making the process easy and not a headache like most property management companies. Jackie is definitely a keeper.

I have been a resident of Tricon for almost 3 yrs now. Therefore I have experienced several maintenance technicians coming through my home. Out of all of them only one technician is Exceptional!! Terrence is the Man!! I get a professional, communicable, well experienced, versatile, hard working, & kind technician every time. I've never been disappointed with the repairs or replacement Terrence has done. You can tell that he cares about the residents, and does every job to the best of his ability. I just want to Thank You Terrence for all that you have done for my family. You are appreciated!!</Review>

I’m editing my initial review! I’ve been on hold for over 30 min, sent email & left messages with no response. Rent payment due, they added $250 month to month charge even though we renewed for 12 months. No way to make partial payments. Customer service absolutely sucks today.

Excellent customer service & response time to maintenance request. I just renewed our lease going on year five, there have been two other property managers in the past, TriCon has been by far the best. Our rep Alicia Smith is amazing. Thanks for making our leasing process easy.< /Review>

RUN!!! DON'T RENT FROM THEM. They fail to help their tenants.  They take work orders and take long to get back to you or give you the wrong information. They hire poor quality contractors to fix things around the house and have them do minimal work. We rent in California and they have been the absolute worst landlord! They don't even deserve a star, they don't care for their homes or tenants.< /Text>

FRAUD!!!! I have reached out for months providing documentation that someone stole my identity and rented a home.  This company would not respond and ignored calls from the police department.  They are now sending me to collections after I sent Federal Trade Commissioner letters of fraud.  BEWARE!  They are all corrupt and will steal your identity and come after you!< /Text>

The house looked great online. It looked okay during the walk through, a dead bug here and there but not that bad. After we move in, roaches start coming out of the woodwork, which, after complaining they fix. The front and back doors had no weatherstripping weatherstripping and a/c was flying right out the door, no pun intended. For about 3 months, we keep finding wasps, some dead and some alive, between the windows and the blinds. We think they must be coming through the windows somehow. After the first 3 months, however, I go into the attic for something and hear a lot of buzzing. I find a MASSIVE wasps nest, spreading between the rafters. The nest has obviously been around for much longer than 3 months. I call the corporate office to get it fixed and they tell me I'm already beyond the first month where I can have them fix any pest problems and that I'll have to pay for it. After A LOT of arguing they reluctantly agree to pay for the pest control. Even the pest control guy said that nest had been up there for a very long time. Fast forward to the end of our lease, after numerous little fixes that took forever to get fixed.. I give notice to vacate at 30 days, unaware I had to give 60 days notice. They're making me pay another month because they automatically assumed that, after not hearing from me at the 60 mark, that I wanted to go month to month.. This was in my contract, which I did not notice, my fault. I was hoping for a little understanding, every single place I've lived required 30 days. Everyone I've talked to has never heard of such a thing, 60 days?? I was hoping for a little compassion, seeing as how this is the end of a lease and you can get seriously screwed if you have to pay for 2 leases, even if for just a month. I received neither. The manager just kept hiding behind the equal housing act and kept saying she couldn't cut me a break if she didn't cut others a break, we all have to be treated equally.. She was also very rude in the way she kept throwing "It was in your contract, it's not my fault you forgot" in my face. I had a 18 month lease, excuse me for not remembering..
If you're reading this wondering, should I rent a house from these people. The answer is simply "HELL NO". They don't care about you, only your money. I've worked customer service/sales my whole life. You can definitely tell they're giving you the kind of service you get when you're stuck somewhere, not the kind to win your business.<//text>

< Review>
Dave Dozier is an absolute pleasure to work with. He is compassionate and dedicated and it shows in every step of the rental process from the first showing through after move in. His honesty and follow-up is what pushed our decision to this rental over another we were considering. An amazing man and so grateful our inquiry was sent to Dave as I couldn’t imagine an outcome as positive and stress free working with another rep. Thank you Dave!!

I also want to that Marjorie for her dedication and helpfulness with the application and paperwork process. Florida to California is a long way, yet she realizes that and works with you from step one with all the actual mailings that take place over electronic transactions. Thank you so much!!< /Review>

<Time>1579630565064< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>My husband and I discovered TriCon American Homes by accident when we were searching for a home, as we had never heard of TriCon American Homes before. This was the best accident we ever had. We were 100% satisfied with the rental process, being able to view the home at our leisure with no pressure from sales teams. Once we found a home, it was impeccable! The home was clean, well kept and new appliances. Any maintenance issues we had were handled and resolved in a timely manner. The maintenance staff is the best!

When we out grew the first TriCon home, we found it was amazingly easy to transfer to another home of our choosing, whether it would have been locally or in another state. The transition process was unbelievably smooth and effortless.

I have never seen a company so concerned about making your leased home feel like as if you were the homeowner of maintenance free property. You can never go wrong leasing with TriCon American Homes. Other home leasing agents need to not just take a page from TriCon's book, they need to read the manual!!!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<name>Laura Thomason</name>< review>
I have had rather unresponsive landlords in the past, so Tricon was an absolute dream! Our home was spotless and freshly painted when I moved in. When I discovered issues with the irrigation system, they sent professional landscapers out to fix it. Any time something broke, they sent someone to fix it right away. When a pipe burst, they sent out an emergency plumber at midnight! Their handyman for Phoenix, Mr. Wes, is such a helpful person! He is so kind and took his time fixing all kinds of things for us. I would rent again from Tricon in a heartbeat.< /review>

<Text>It was a tough year for my family. We flooded during Hurricane Harvey. Had to basically gut and remodel existing house. We sold that house and began construction on a new house. We needed to find a temporary housing within our current school district. Tricon was that solution. They made it very simple for us. They were extremely professional, courteous and knowledgeable. The website made everything very simple. Project managers and maintenance folks always took care of any issues quickly. The CSRs in California were awesome. Tricon really helped us out a pretty serious situation. Keep up the great work. If we ever need rental services again, y’all will be out 1st pick.

Hope y’all have a great New Year

Thanks Team Tricon!!!!

< Review>
all things considered, this should be a five star review, as far as nation-wide management companies are concerned, tricon is the best i have dealt with. and i have probably been through four different "regimes".their system is awesome, quite simple, the home i leased was in fabulous shape, though it may be a unique situation...scott, our "man on the ground" was the best part of it all so far. so, why four stars? the process feels rushed to me. you need to come to the table correct. if you decide you want to lease from them, you better have deposit(which is a wonderful method they employ), rent, reservation fee, etc. ready to go before you pull the trigger. the whole process takes less than a week from start to finish with no excuses. makes me feel unimportant should i have issues, as i personally did.<//Review>

<Text>The process of viewing the house very easy.  Application process very easy and straight forward  but ....

When I received the house it was filthy; even me pointing this out before moving the maintenance team did not do what was needed. A new construction home so cleaning was needed for construction dust plus the toilets were used by someone and left there business all over the toilet. Now I have another issue. I was offered a first month free due to a promotion. I have called twice to get this correct and now they have me as delincuent on the company account. Added $175.00 as late fee when I was not supposed to pay. No one picks up the phone when you call and there 1800 number people keep telling me all is ok we will update your account but it does not happen.

I have never rented this is my first time due to a fast sale of my home to relocate but this is not professional nor legal to offer a promo and not honor it.

Let's see if someone see this and at least call me back.< /Text>< pictures>

51 Hollyberry Court
Nicely renovated home.

Customer service is extremely lacking. Response time when contacting property manager is practically nonexistent. Basically just keep trying until you finally get a answer.

Maintenance has not addressed issues for over a month. Water damage from a water main leak has not been fixed and is continuing to spread. Multiple maintenance requests have apparently been submitted bye property manager to no avail.

Gradually becoming more and more disappointed.
After you sign lease and hand over your money, it’s basically “good luck” with receiving help with issues, questions, or concerns.< /Text>

Renting from Tricon has been an amazing experience. This was actually the first house I looked at and I fell in love immediately. The staff at Tricon was able to get me into my dream house within 2 days. Everyone that I have dealt with has been fabulous, understanding and supportive. Due to the recent hurricane, I had some specific needs and they were awesome. We've lived there for over a year and I just signed a new 2 year lease. If they had a 20 year lease, I would sign it. I could go on all day about Tricon. I always hesitated to rent a house because I thought I would be micromanaged and it would not feel like mine. This is definitely not the case with Tricon. I feel like my house is MY home and if I need anything, I get an immediate response. It's the feeling of having your own home but knowing if anything breaks they will move mountains even on holiday weekends to fix anything. Thank you so much for an incredible experience.<//Text>

< review>
Tricon American is by far the worst property management company that I have ever rented from. They charged my wife and I a month to month fee of $250 for no reason. We renewed our lease for a year a month ago. They also keep charging us $25 dollars for renter's insurance, but here again we made sure we added them to the insurance that we have on our own. A Tricon American rep. hung up on my wife when we were trying to resolve the renter's insurance thing the first time. If you see them as the renting property management company I would not rent from them AT ALL! GO ELSE WHERE!</review>

<Review>UPDATE::!!!!! 3/31/2017
Since my first complaint my needs have been met and all repairs were made.  I have also been contacted by several managers making sure I was comfortable in my new home and expressing their apologies. I'm comfortable now and loving my home hopefully I will continue to get better service. All the stress was worth it because it is truly my dream home.

3/23/17
I am so upset with myself for not listening to the comments on SEVERAL sites about this company. I saw the home I loved and immediately filled out an application. It came back approved with conditions because we are still working on our credit. So instead of the $1300 deposit I had to pay $1,950. Wasn't a problem. During that time the rep I was working with was horrible. I could hardly reach her. I thought about backing out especially since the reviews sucked I had a weird feeling. Then another rep contacted me and said she would be the one I would actually meet at the property. She was very lovely and I felt better. Shortly after she stopped responding. Sometimes she would call the next day or sometimes 2 days later. Or when I called the office and complained. Nonetheless I know she's busy so I just want to get my keys. I receive the keys yesterday. As we're going through the house we make a checklist of issues with the house. Some basic, some careless and questionable but I received confirmation that maintenance would be out this week. So all was good. Yesterday my sister and niece spent the night while I'm still in my apartment and with child. I plan to move  this Sunday. My sister calls me screaming just now saying my niece has BED BUGS all over and they killed 5. The office is closed right now I am so livid. I really hope this turns out for the better and not to be a disaster. I'm speechless.</Review>< GmapID>

We searched for months and made several appointments with a few companies but Tricon has the best homes. Kathryn Saniuk showed us the diamond in the rough!!!  She saw the home once so we pulled it up online but no pictures. She said, I really think you would love this house, it is perfect!!  Kathryn is a phenomenal realtor and I am sending everyone I know to her.

David was Amazing!!   He was patient and knowledgeable about the home and all of its amenities. David answered all of our questions and gave great advice about the home while explaining in detail the lease and expectations for the conditions of the home. This was a wonderful experience and I am recommending Tricon for everyone who wants to rent a home!!< /Review>

If I ever have to move again, I'm asking Tricon for a property in the new area first.  Seriously great service!  Administrative Team = Jennifer Huasman is awesome.  Gary Pena is the guy I call to fix anything,  He ROCKS. Always takes care of me.  The whole company is like this.
OUTSTANDING service!<//Review>

<text>I recently moved from Georgia because of a new job and let me just say that Christopher Smith has made the transition and move to South Carolina better than imagined. Not only was he in contact throughout the process to make sure that everything was taken care of, but he frequently checks in to make sure that I'm still doing well and not having any issues. He has by far exceeded my expectations as a realtor and I hope that everyone can have a realtor as awesome as Chris.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

The best part of renting from Tricon was  Pedro and Teto! Not only did they take the time to fix things the right way they were also a joy to have around! Also once issues were brought to Wendy and Todd's attention they were true to their word and went above and beyond in handle the situation.</review>

Tricon sent a gentleman named James Crawford to repair the minor issues we had at the property, he was courteous and very efficient. Mr. Crawford repaired the issues in a timely manner and  ensured that I was satisfied with the work done before he left.  I would recommend him for any future repairs.<//Text>

Does not follow through with any concerns that we address, nor do they do a good job of keeping up with correct personal records. My sister and I have been renting together for the past year and we’ve been emailed multiple times with incorrect pricing, lease agreements, etc. The whole lease end has been nothing but a pain and they are doing everything wrong to try and set things straight. Would not recommend renting with them.</Review>

My roommates and I were on a serious time crunch to find a house. We applied and got approved the next day. Michelle was very prompt with answering all my questions (which was a lot). Our move in day went very well. I was VERY pleased with the guy we worked with, David K. He was very honest and up front with us. He took plenty of pictures for us to use as a reference if anything was wrong. He answered all of our questions. Went above and beyond going through the house very thoroughly and took his time showing us every detail. He made sure we knew how to get in contact with maintenance and made me feel at ease. His customer service skills were awesome, he knows how to treat customers right!</text>

I was looking for a home for 5 months through the MLS with a realtor and couldn't find the location or space that I needed for my family.  Losing hundreds of dollars applying for homes that I wasn't sure I would get approved for since there were other applicants applying as well.  Then I found Tricon, thank God!!! I scheduled a viewing, applied for the home and got my keys all within less than a month.  I love our new home, everything that I was looking for it had.  My agent Monica was outstanding, answered all my questions and was so polite and professional.  Tricon is exceptional!!!<//Review>

<review>I’ve been with Tricon for 3 years now.  Silverbay sold to Tricon, I was really concern with the sell, I was with Silverbay for 3 years. But to my very pleasing surprise, it has been GREAT!! Repairs are done in a timely manner. Even quicker now that Tricon has their own maintenance crew! The staff is very professional and courteous. I would recommend this management company.

<text>I just rented a home from Tricon over the weekend. I've been pleasantly surprised with the process. Gabe showed me my home and Cindy put in work orders and followed up on them. Jason came to my home with maintenance work and expected to be there 4 hours, but was there 5 and a half hours. He never got frustrated. He had to make two Home Depot trips. Was so courteous and friendly. Kept me updated and gave me ideas for other things. He followed up on some things and made sure to take pictures of everything. He didn't try to do things half way, but finished each job fully! I was so happy with his work and will always request him.<//text><Date>1534445669903<//Date></record>

<review>I'm coming up on my first year anniversary of my residency.  Looking  forward to  renewing my lease. I'm a big advocate of customer service . When I saw my house the workers was inside  working diligently. To shortened my story I went on line and started the process. Cindy and  the WHOLE staff  was so helpful . I had a couple of minor maintenance issues that was handled promptly. I  enjoy my home and recommend TRICON  properties if you're looking for a great home with a great customer service  attentive.</review>< Rating>

I’ve look at several homes in Concord, NC and they are reasonably priced , however the Customer services communication is not in alignment. Everyone has a different answer. I request to speak with an agent after we made a decision because of all the inconsistencies with customer service. This was done on the 15th of Nov and as of today November 20 after speaking with a manager and calling several times the agent Ashley Dickerson has not called me or responded to the emails from Corporate. It’s seems to me that a different procedure would be put in place if an agent doesn’t respond. I was really interested in the home, but I will not force anyone to be professional. Warning signs recognized. Tricon Homes process is for you to submit an application ($45) and a $250 and upon approval it will be subtracted from the rent that month. My concern was them following through or addressing my concerns prior to move in. We all know that properties don’t always address concerns the way we think they should, I wanted to know, be well informed prior too the application because if you change your mind, you lose the $250 fee. The process is very impersonal. Please read the Disclaimer and policy. I know you’ll need to move, but to often we miss the little things and they will cost you long term. Keep track of your receipts and call log. Get the details in writing. Hugo the manager was very helpful, but Ashley didn’t even respond to the management team, nor did the Charlotte office.<//Review>

James Crawford of Charlotte, NC came to view my carpet due to a pet odor and fleas upon move in. I’m only reviewing the service provided by this maintenance man and not the company as a whole. He did good fixing my light bulb and garage door opener, although I expected him in the morning (because that’s what they told me on the phone). He told me that he was scheduled to come in the evening.  All in all he was cool, professional and effective as a company representative should be.< /review>

<text>This review is strictly for Terrance Griffith that works as a maintenance person for Tricon American Homes in the Atlanta area office.

Terrance is absolutely wonderful!  He is extremely professional, efficient, thorough, on-time, and does outstanding work.  My husband and I have had the pleasure of having him take care of several maintenance items on the home we currently rent with Tricon.  Terrance not only fixed multiple items around the home for us, but "re-fixed" a few things that other maintenance guys from the company had supposedly fixed.  Either way, Terrance did an amazing job.

Although our overall experience with Tricon as a company so far hasn't been the best, Terrance is definitely a gem within.  I hope Tricon knows what a great asset he is to their company and treats him well.< /text><Resp>{'time': 1530056204869, 'text': 'Ms. Phillips, We will be sure that Mr. Griffith receives this review, and truly appreciate you taking the time to write it.

just a nightmare . they do nothing to ease your move in process. ive been transferred multiple regarding questions about my lease because the amounts were calculated wrong also they would not tell  me who services the address i was moving into. this is the worse company i had to work with and im doubting even signing a lease with them. if it such a headache even before the move in how will it be when i actually move in. !</Review>

Tricon had a quick process to get my family into a home but when it comes to maintenance they are SLOW and sloppy. I’ve had leak after leak in this home   They schedule maintenance and several times  the contractors are no shows or make the issues worse. The problem still isn’t fixed   If I had to do it again I’d have taken the $1540 I pay for this raggedy house & rented a newer apartment instead.</Review>

We rented from Tricon for almost 3 years.   They never fixed the leak in the bath tub that soaked the downstairs ceiling whenever someone decided to sit in the tub and bathe.  Also, after we moved out they charged us to repaint the home.  Mind you...we had no holes in the walls, no issues at all.  Just normal wear and tear from them deciding to paint an entire house with flat paint.  They charged us to paint the entire house.  I would recommend that you stay away from this company.  They're robbers.

The rent goes up every year as well so be aware.  If you start off paying $1,200 they'll increase it the next year to $1325 and it will continue to increase each year.  I thank God we purchased a home.  Stay away from them.  The rep for Columbia never returns calls or emails.   It was a disaster with communication after the last area manager left.  I want to inform anyone before going into a contract with Tricon.   They do quick patchwork to make the home look good and things fall apart while you're renting.  Stay away!  I have disputed the paint charge 2 weeks afgo and have yet to hear back from the area manager regarding my issues.<//text>

<Date>1571763674222<//Date><review>Very bad experience. I found a nice home to rent and was given so many different excuses as to why I could not be approved. I was told my income wasn't enough but the rep actually was not calculating the numbers correct. I provided a 1099 from my contract employer and was told I needed a letter from them or copies of bank statements as if the 1099 wasn't enough! I even sent my tax records and was told no they couldn't use that. I am relocating from SC to NC and its hard trying to find a place over the internet but I drove to view this home and it was perfect for my family! The application specialist would not take my voluntary child support agreement which was notarized!! It was like they just refused to accept my application! Without the part time income and child support I was 130.00 off from the income mark and they would not budge! Needless to say I would NOT recommend using them and I am not happy with the way I was treated!< /review>< gmap_id>

I am a new resident with Tricon, as well as to the state of SC and Kayla Johnson is my Super Star!!! She made my move seamless.  I found a beautiful home on the Tricon website.  I put in my application and I was approved the next day!!! I work 50-60 hours a week so I am dead tired by the time I get off work.  Kayla kept me on my toes!!!  She made sure I had all my paperwork, answered all my questions, gave me info on things I needed to do to make my move as easy as possible and she eased my stress because moving from one state to another is a HUGE STRESS!!  She managed to ease all my stress and I am so grateful to have had her assisting me.  What a fine example of Great Customer Service!!  I will recommend Tricon American Homes to ALL my family and friends!!<//Text>

The people in this company that I have got to work with Tiffany Saylor in Dallas Texas  that is the head portfolio manager the head maintenece manager in the Houston Texas area  Anthony, and Tim the local lead maintenance in our area were some of the most exceptional, caring,  compassionate and  efficient. They truly truly care about their residence. They treat you like family and make sure you are taken care. We are so blessed we have rented from Tricon American Homes. And even though it’s a corporation they treat you like family on a personal level.  Can’t say enough amazing things about these people!< /text>

<review>This review is for the employees that work for Tricon American Homes in Phoenix, AZ. Speaking as a homeowner myself, I was hesitant on dealing with a property management company since for the last five years I have lived in houses that I own. Well, I needed to rent since I moved to Arizona with no knowledge on the area. Candace at Tricon American Homes here in Phoenix made moving in enjoyable and exciting. It is nice to see people like her professionally caring for someones home but also being understanding of the renters side as well. When I buy a rental property in Arizona I will definitely use Tricon American Homes as my property management company. Very pleased with their business.< /review>< Pics>

Hello,
I just wanted to share my experiences
I have been  dealing with Silver Bay for over a year until the change to Tricon. I have never had any issues with either company. They offer really nice, clean move in ready homes. Their prices are well within the market prices. From the beginning , I have almost exclusively dealt with Dawn Jones. I almost feel like she was and still is my personal contact with the company.  I can contact her for any reason, or question. She is very responsive to any request whether it be though e-mail, or phone contact.
When the company changed over to Tricon, there was no difference in anything at all. Everything remained the same with the exception of a new website. The payment options on the site are wonderful, and fast. Log in, pay your bill, log out. They have an online maintenance request feature as well which we have not had to use, but I''m confident that will be great as well. We may be looking to buy a home very soon, and I'm confident the company will help us. Thank you Dawn Jones, Silver Bay, and Tricon for giving my family a nice home to live in.<//Review>

<review>Good experience overall.  I was worried about security deposit credit due to other reviews, but I detailed clean the house and spoke with maintenance on any issues before moving out.  I got full refund with 13 days of moving out, which is quicker than any place I have lived.  If you keep up on maintenance, dont trash the place, and clean up well you won't have any problems.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I recently moved into an apartment  managed by Tricon American Homes. Not only was Tricon very accommodating to my schedule, during the application process, and moving timeline. Also, thank you to Heaven to everyone at Tricon for answering all my concerns in a timely manner. This company is very responsive and clearly wants their tenants to be happy. Lastly- very easy online system that allows tenants to make rent payments and make maintenance requests . I would recommend this company 10/10.<//text>

we moved into a Tricon home about a month ago. Brandon, Tiffany, and Victor have all been great to work with. I manage apartments for the last 11 years and know how taxing this job can be. They are always prompt, efficient, and thorough on any requests I have on top of being happy and positive. HUGE SHOUT OUT TO Victor!!!! He even texts me completion photos of the work he does when I am not there with him. He is so fast and efficient at his job and a pleasure to be around.<//review>

He was nice, professional, and cleaned up after himself. He fixed the problems quickly and explained everything he had done.

We went around to different homes that had self view, which we loved the ease of looking at the home without someone hounding you. After viewing a few homes and searching the website we fell in love with one home that unfortunately wasn't self view. Setting up a viewing was easy as well. The call center and Chris were more than willing to help. We set up an appointment, viewed the home and decided to do the application. Application process wasn't bad: set up an account, apply and wait for the response. It took them about 24 hours to approve us. Chris called us with all the details and we were in the home in less than a week! Would recommend to anyone moving!</text>< username>

I give Jason Taves (Maintenance) a  5 Star rating.  This was his second stop to our home and as always had superior service.  He called me 15 minutes before he arrived on 8/10, announced himself at the door  along who he worked for and throughout the entire time he was here, kept me informed as to what he was doing.  He provided tips & tricks on how to keep operational in the home and was just overall nice.  Jason was quick, efficient and once all was done walked me through everything he had done in the house.  That is optimal service.  If I need service again I will request you only send Jason as he provided a great customer experience.< /text>

I have rented from Tricon for the past year & 1/2. When ever there is a issue or something I need, I can count one someone to help!  Everyone I have ever spoken to has always helped me, Wendy, Steven & Brian all get it done! And Eddie is the best  maintenance guy when it comes to getting whatever need to be fixed.< /text>

We recently moved from out of state into our home only seeing small pictures online. The house was as pictured! No enhancements were made to the photos so we we very pleasantly surprised. Yolanda and Candace were super helpful both on the phone and through email to make this a smooth transition for us. Thank you!
***UPDATE***We just moved out and into our forever home. The staff at TAH have been great. From giving notice to the final walk through, it was a seamless experience with everyone being professional and friendly. We have recommended them and will continue to do so!<//Review>

Terrence Griffith, Maintenance Technician with Tricon Homes came out to my house to complete my maintenance requests. Terrence was very respectful and professional and he did a great job in completing all of my maintenance requests. I was very impressed by him. He talked with me and my mom about what had to be done and given us information that could help in the future with some of the requests. I appreciate Tricon Homes having someone like Terrence working for them.<//Text>

Not happy with them!  My husband and I were approved for one of their homes. But were being rushed to pay their security deposit and move in by their deadline.  Today is 10/23 and they way wanted a $2473.50 security deposit  by Friday 10/25!!! Then, we had to move in between 10/28-11/5!!  And pay 1st month rent.  We tried to explain that we were currently in a lease that wouldn't end until 11/30 but we were willing to move in a little earlier than that because we will have already paid our current rent.  They were un willing to work with us a little so we ended up having to forfeiti $250.00 because we had to cancel!! FYI: BE READY TO MOVE IN IMMEDIATELY SHOULD YOU BE INTERESTED.< /Text>

Initially the property management company that I rented the home from was called Sliver Bay.  They changed management in the middle of my lease to Tricon American Homes. Since I've been living in the home, I've had to file nine maintenance request concerning the property. The maintenance request ranged from pest control to Septic tank. The fact that the house hasn't been maintained is the main problem. There's rodents running around in the attic, after setting traps I stumbled across a snake that had molted. The water line has broken twice, because it wasn't repaired correctly the first time. Know that the water line has been repaired, the water pressure in the house is now low. This meaning that the water in the toilets are below the water level. When the plumbers repaired the water line, they mention that they wanted to re-do the plumbing in the entire house. I had to reject because it meant another crew would have to come behind the plumbers to re-plaster the walls.  As of right now I'm owed a reimbursement for the overage charges due to the water bill increase because of the water line breaking. I was told that I had to wait 30 days after the repair. I've waited more than 30 days and I haven't heard from the property manager yet. There are several issues with the roof concerning leaks, where mold detected in one room and water damage in another. I was without AC for two and half days, when I filed a maintenance request to have the AC investigated, it was categorized as an emergency. I was told that the vendor would be available 24 hrs, for scheduling. The vendor was not available. I had to wait a day after scheduling the vendor. I just don't think this property management company is willing to do what's right to make their tenants, comfortable or happy.
A day after the AC has been repaired, now I don't have any hot water, smdh ...</text>

< Review>
Been with Tricon for about 3 years here in Laveen (Phoenix Arizona ) 1st year was with SilverBay which Tricon bought out. So I had Tricon for 2 years technically. I can honestly say they are a good Management/REIT Company. They have never let me down in terms of communication, Maintainance and Repairs. Their properties are top notch as well. The inspection process is easy and smooth. They are always on TOP of their properties. Just to give you an idea, they have a superintendent do your move out. Everything is documented digitally and one of the benefits for new tenants moving in, is that they are actually making notes on the repairs etc needed to get the property back out to rent ASAP.  When my move out was completed, they were already in high gear to repair, paint, replace etc within minutes of completing my move out with them!

You can’t beat a company that’s on top of it like that! Literally within minutes of move out workers and contractors etc  begin working.

If you are planning to lease a tricon property trust me, they are the best when it comes to residential rental property.< /Review>

I currently  reside at one of Tricon properties. I called into the office because I’m interested in transferring to another property. My assistant portfolio manager is Latoshia Bates, all I can say is that she’s quite an asset to this company she was able to answer every question and follow through with every request that I had. Honestly I’ve never had service like this before it was absolutely outstanding.< /Review>

I moved into my home at the beginning of July and it is now mid October. My experience with Tricon has been great so far. Maintenance staff is very polite and responsive when I need anything, and I feel that the home I live in is quite reasonably priced for it's size and location. I haven't noticed any major issues with the house and I really love the neighborhood

I actually found Tricon through a craigslist scam-a guy was trying to get a wire transfer out of me by pretending he represented Tricon homes. MAKE SURE YOU ARE CONTACTING TRICON DIRECTLY IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO BUSINESS WITH THEM as there are scammers out there. Use the number on their website only</review>

Most recent a matter of palm tree frond removal was done professionally, speedly and complete including the removal of the cutting debris. Mark was the technician assigned.

We’ve been with Tricon for about 6 months. I have had great communication with them regarding minor issues needing fixed. Maintenance requests are handled within 24 hours and Janet who handles out local needs is always in contact, she is wonderful. Move in was easy and quick and I look forward to the rest of our tenancy with Tricon.<//Review>

<review>Beautiful home in California however, they tell me it’s completely okay to live in a home that is 82 degrees or hotter in the summer. They claim that if it’s 110 outside my house will not be cooler than 90 degrees. My air conditioner can not keep up and never turns off. Electric bill is 450 dollars or more and my home will not get cooler than 82 in the summer. They refuse to do anything about this since the air conditioner is in working condition. Beware, they do not care about you only your money. I have a 18 month old daughter and her bedroom is 90 degrees or hotter even with a fan. They claim this is okay. I would have given a lower review if i could have. I highly doubt they would live in conditions like this and it is sad they are forcing me to. I will be leaving as soon as my lease is up and I am reviewing them on every site possible so no one has to live this way.

Update:
The rental company sent out a technician who could have figured out the issue and they installed ceiling fans. Hopefully this summer the house will actually be liveable.<//review><response>{'time': 1527624042687, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

<Text>My daughter and our friend applied for a house rental lease in Las Vegas and the process was quick and seamless. Being a realtor, I was amazed at the system in place and how efficiently all the pieces came together. I was very pleased that my daughter had such a great experience with Tricon and her realtor,  Monica Osborn.</Text>< Resp>

Application process with them was the most unfortunate. By far WORST experience. Starting with Tanya Villanueva who I had all contact since the beginning when I had the self tour . She was great up until
Our application fee plus deposit was made . She will call my cellphone email me constant communication back and forth trying to help with process . I even got complementary calls where she’s just call to check in asking if theirs anything She could do to ease process .But really what it was is that she was trying to get me to pay the application fee. Plus deposit .  I told her I was stuck at work short staff she went so far to encourage me to asked someone else for their credit/debit card information  and then I payed them back cash . I was very excited about this home . So in that moment
It sounded ok . But it wasn’t something it sounded legitimate . I told her I’d called her after work . She then said I just someone apply for the same home . I responded oh Ok well I guess i no longer need to worry about making an attempt to pay anything if someone else already did so . She again said no mam they started the application but they have not made a payment . You can still make payment to hold home . The end of my day arrived I drove myself straight to my bank Before I made payment I called her while standing outside my bank to get reassurance from her that if I’d payed application fee plus deposit amount the home would be held meaning nobody else be able to apply or process an application. She reassured me by stating the following “yes mam no worries that’s basically buying you time “ To get all of Your documents together the application wouldn’t not be submitted until you manually doit . Which gave me a peace of mind and I felt a little more eased to gather everything. . I finally process the payment made it to my current home emailed her letting her know payment had been made along with an attachment of the receipt of my payment . Next day came never received a reply . No calls . No NOTHING! Wait it only gets worst I receive an email with a denial at this point I was confused . Everything she’d
told me was not adding up . I called to talk to someone after trying to reach Tanya multiple times by phone and email . Finally someone answers me said oh man I can see your refund is in the process like what ? I was confused nothing she’s said was adding up . I demanded to speak with a manager at this point Brent comes in the picture and for a manager Poor ethics skills this man sat there and told me he didn’t believe Tanya would do any of the things I’d mentioned I told him “you are not gonna sit there tell me what she did and didn’t say bc last time I checked the conversation took place between me and her “ he then ask to put me on hold to “listen” to the calls .. finally came to the line after a matter of minutes . Saying she was gone when I email her . And then when I called she was in her lunch brake . 1st of all as i stood in my office at work looked at the time it was the SAME time we’d been talking trying to get me to get payment submitted. He said ok mam I’ll have a talk with her . And your refund should come in as soon as your bank releases it . Which by the time I clocked out  I see $100 dollars missing when application fee is $50 I called them back Melissa answered saying she couldn’t put Brent on the phone bc he didn’t handle application department. Ok put whoever the manager for that  department is . They said she was on a call . But her name was Renee. She puts me on hold and Brent comes on the phone I said I don’t want to speak with you bc Melissa said Renee is the manager for application department. How come all of sudden  you want  to address me . Please just Renee on the phone I will wait for her . He kept asking why I did not want to speak to him . My fuse at this point was short and it blew up . To where I cussed him out right and left up and down  . My frustration at this point was SKY HIGH . He had the audacity to hang up on me
. Last thing I heard from him was mam we gonna refund you every dollar you paid .<//Text>

{'time': 1576522155004, 'text': 'Anakaren Gomez, thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.  At Tricon American Homes, we consistently apply the same responsible applicant screening criteria to all applicants in full compliance with all applicable state and federal fair housing requirements. To ensure a fair, consistent and appropriately rigorous review in all cases, we retain a third party to review each applicant by consistently applying the same criteria. These reviews are comprehensive and include verification of employment, recorded evictions, and criminal convictions. Should your background check come back and is cleared, your application is approved pending verification of income you listed on your application. Upon submission of the rental application, you agreed to the Company’s Terms of Agreement as well as paid a non-refundable application fee per applicant and a $250 non-refundable holding deposit.  Our non-refundable holding deposit is in place as a formal expression of intent to acknowledge the prospective resident’s hold on a home while the application is processed. In accordance with our Terms of Agreement, and in observance of Fair Housing, we universally apply the same standards to all our prospective residents, therefore the holding fee has not been returned.  Thank you.'}< /Response>

Tricon has been an okay management company overall, and I would probably only give this review 3 stars, like said it's been okay.
However there has been one agent that has been extremely helpful for me over the last month. Shadee Livingston gave me her direct line and was so wonderful during a massive repair in a downstairs bathroom. Thank you so much for being understanding and easy to get ahold of, you made the whole process much easier.</Text>

<review>I looked a cute condo in Blackfalds thought it was a good price $1100 a month plus utilities. It said pet friendly when I brought up that I would have a dog she didn’t say anything then a couple minutes later she threw out that it would be a $200 dollar non refundable pet fee. I haven’t had to rent for a while as we owned our own home but I just thought that was a lot to ask for a 5 pound dog. When there isn’t even carpets. It made me feel like it was a price thrown out last minute. I also felt like they were all about money not even concerned about if you would stay long and be good tenant bet your rent would go up after your Lease came up and by the other reviews sounds like I was right.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Can't wait to be done with this company once and for all. They can't keep their promises about anything... will not give my security deposit back and give me the run around about where my checks at. Charged me $200 because I didn't pressure wash my house after 5 years when they didn't tell me to before move out... I hate this place.</review>< Rate>

<text>Tricon had someone out the next day after putting in two work orders. The Tricon worker knew what he was doing with the irrigation system, but didn't do so good with the electrical but they sent out an electrician to fix the problem in a timely manner. He took down the fixtures & found the problem. He even gave me his number if the problem happens again anytime in the next week. He was going to keep the work order open just in case. Told me that if it did happen again they would need to replace the fixtures. I'm very happy with the timely manner that everything was taken care of.</text><Gmap_id>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133</Gmap_id>< userid>

Very professional company.  We recently had some unforseen medical issues come up and couldn't make our rent on time.  Rachel was very understanding and did what she could do to help us.

<Text>Entrepreneurs! Listen. IF you plan to start a home based business, Tricon won't be a good fit to lease from! According to one of the portfolio managers in GA, Tricon's legal team does not allow ANY type of home based business in ANY of their homes. In a time where small businesses are growing rapidly, I was surprised to find this out. I was told that they have no way of verifying the type of business operating, well duh ask for proof of a bisiness license. If there is non-compliance fine them.</Text><Resp>{'time': 1560895052677, 'text': 'Courtni, we appreciate you reaching out to our regional team to inquire about having a home-based business ran out of your home.

I am from out of state and am renting with Tricon East Atlanta. I worked with Ms.Latoisha and Ms. Sherry, from the East Atlanta office and she’s honestly THE BEST. I never worked with two agents were always  so consistent and helpful in every matter. You can tell they both have a passion  for helping people and real estate! They have been truly wonderful in every aspect. They made my renting experience extremely easy. I recommend everyone to rent with Ms.Latoisha and Ms.Sherry!!!!!</review>

<date>1570302677470</date><rating>1<//rating><text>I ended up breaking my lease early because I was tired of dealing with these slumlords. They never fixed anything and they charge $100 a month for a pool contractor which told me he only gets $20 a month. Sounds kind of shady to me and the pool guy admitted this is why he doesn't do much. Place had termite infestation, horrible carpet, and after 2 weeks being in one of the homes the bathtub started peeling? Yea, I guess they only paint them instead of replace them. They said my family would have to leave the house for 8 hours to have it repainted because of the chemicals. All around this is a bad deal, I recommend working with home owners directly to rent or find a better company. They still charged me for breaking my lease and I'm just not going to pay it, I don't care... it's about the principle of the matter here.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1570654759972, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear about your frustrating experience.

I was a resident of Tricon American. I recently moved out and received an invoice that included a $250 fee for cleaning carpet.  That would be fine if the home was wall to wall carpet.  However the home ONLY HAS 3 ROOMS WITH CARPET and that's the same price for a whole house cost $250 not 3 rooms.  Outrageous!  They wouldn't even work with me.  I was a good resident and this is how I'm treated.  They took the entire $1600 deposit + asking for more.  Really?< /review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>My girlfriend and I are a little over two months into leasing a home in Georgia with Tricon. Since we moved in at the end of August our water heater, garage, and HVAC system have all gone down. The garage was fixed within a week. The water heater was finally fixed after a little over two weeks, but the HVAC system has been down for almost 3 weeks now and no one from Tricon has contacted us ONCE. Despite our almost daily calls to get this handled. According to the call center (which is located in California) they can’t do anything other than request a call from the local property manager. We have not heard from him/her yet. The vendor that installed the unit has been out two times so far, not to mention a Tricon tech coming out initially to inspect the unit. The Tricon tech got to our house, looked at the system and said he “can’t work on it because it’s under warranty”. WHY would he not know that? And why did we wait 4 days and have to take off work so he could come out just to tell us that he couldn’t help? The vendor’s tech is even worse. At first he only answered the phone or called back on days that it rained to say he WOULD come out to look if it wasn’t raining. When he finally came out (two hours late, and exactly 14 days after the original request) he said the unit was frozen so he couldn’t get a reading, but it appeared low on refrigerant. He came back two days later (again two hours late) and finally replaced the damaged water heater but DIDNT BRING ENOUGH REFRIGERANT. He said he would come the next day and never showed. When I contacted Tricon AGAIN I was told, & I quote “you’re renting the house, so it’s your house. Why we would reach out to the vendor for you. You need to speak with them.” Now he won’t answer his phone at all. We’ve had two more calls with Tricon since his disappearing act and they’re back to their old standby that “the local property manager will reach out tomorrow”. I usually don’t leave reviews because I know things happen, but this shows either complete ineptitude at property management from Tricon or a callous disregard for paying customers. We’ve had to take off of work early multiple times, just to be stood up and never called back. We agreed to pay a certain amount with the expectation that we would at least have working heat, so to spend 3 weeks in late October/ early November without it is a lot to ask. Also, the water heater that he installed Monday (2 days ago) is already leaking.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Janet Oliver, the Indianapolis Maintenance Coordinator, is always very responsive and courteous. I think my rent has been pretty reasonable and has not been excessively increased each year. I do wish that more services/maintenance coverage were included in the rent - I feel like most of that work falls on me/my wallet, even though I'm just renting. The company that owned the house prior to Tricon had a full-time handy man, who would take care of all sorts of issues for me. Alternatively, I wish Tricon would sell me the house, but they refuse to do so.< /Review></record>

Tricon Atlanta team did an exceptional job! The entire team was professional throughout the entire process! My family had a piece of mind during our relocation to the area as we received consistent updates and statuses regarding the area and any questions we had. Tracey, Dennis and Addison are great! Keep creating a great customer experience! Love the Browns!< /text>

<Review>We have been in our new home for about two weeks now and we absolutely love it! Christopher Smith in Columbia South Carolina made the process of renting this home so easy! We talk to him about all the details we wanted and he was able to find the perfect home for us without us having to search through many homes! He was very professional. I even called him on his day off and he helped me without hesitation. Also during our move in inspection (2 days prior to moving in due to threats of hurricane Florence) we noticed the ice machine didn’t work. On move in day it was fixed! We were very impressed. I definitely recommend renting with Tricon and also having Christopher as your leasing agent!!< /Review><userid>103303590763737144590< /userid><rate>5</rate><Resp>{'time': 1539112087965, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to write this great review and detailing your move-in experience with us.

I loved my house,  my neighbors and my experience with Tricon. I never had an issue when I needed anything. I made some great memories in my leased home and Tricon made that experience even more enjoyable. The staff was very helpful and I would definitely recommend this leasing company to anyone in the market. Thank you, Tricon !< /Review>

This was the most hassle free and efficient way that I have lease a property. Brain made sure he was always in communication with me on everything. He made the process very easy, he was always just one call away with any questions. The move in was so simple, and everyone handle everything so Professional. If your in South Florida area, Brian is the go to guy.<//text>

I have had a tough go here in changing to living in San Antonio, but anything I need Marlena makes happen. She has a great attitude and compassion, which is hard to find in people.

Hello Everyone, My name is Roy and I have been a resident with Tricon for 3 years now. The properties are very well maintained, however I believe my number #1 reason for staying with Tricon is because of Gina Nelson. Because of her professionalism, quick response in getting issues resolved, and compassion she has with dealing with residents speaks volume. I've been around people long enough to know if they're genuine, and that she is. That Gina for making me feel like I own the property even though I'm just a renter.< /Review>

After living here officially for at least 1 month, there were a few repairs needed in the home from leaking sink, broken air turbine vent, broken garage-door spring. She was quick in getting these issues addressed.

We're still having a few issues in the house and she's very helpful in guiding us in what to do when we ask for it. Go Jennifer!

<text>Horrible customer service. This review is for Tricon Homes rentals at Vistancia. Even after calling for repairs they take a week to get back to you. Then after you finally schedule something they don’t turn up claiming they didn’t have you on the schedule but they only called (on the day of supposed service) to ‘follow up’. If this place did not offer the Vistancia resident benefits nobody would bother to rent here for the pathetic way they treat their tenants - plus the rent isn’t exactly cheap. It doesn’t matter if they don’t keep up to their end of providing at least basic care and they don’t even have the least bit of courtesy for the people living here.  Biggest mistake of my life moving into this horrible place. Wish I could give them negative stars.

Again,  thank you and we look forward to serving you in the future.'}<//Response><review>UPDATE: RentCafe has cleared and I was able to speak with someone here locally and get her contact information. Updating the rating to reflect the prompt and courteous service I received today!

This company recently bought out Silver Bay Homes, in May 2017. I was in the process of moving in and wasn't told. I actually found out on my walk through! Had I known, I never would have signed. I agreed to have Silver Bay as my PM, not Tricon. Silver Bay had an office here in Atlanta and I was comfortable with having a local office and home team. I know nothing of these people but the bad reviews and my rent for May and deposit still hasn't been transferred over so I see an outstanding balance in the portal. I've called and emailed and of course no answer and no way to head up to the office to talk to anyone about my concerns. I'm hoping this isn't a sign of things to come in terms of loosing rent or not being able to actually receive maintenance when needed. I love the home so the rating is purely for that, I've been here a little less than a week so I'll update as things develop. I'm just hoping that the issues with Rent Cafe are addressed soon so that I feel comfortable paying June's rent.< /review><Name>Jessica Jackson</Name>< Date>

Love our house. This is our third year staying with Tricon. Everyone in the Atlanta office is amazing.  I'd like to personally thank Shadee Livingston for her help with getting all maintenance requests we have submitted assigned and taken care of immediately.  She's wonderful in her position and no one could do it
better. Also, Anthony Gilmore is an excellent employee there. These guys go above and beyond!</Text>

Tricon American Homes has made out cross country move a seamless transition.  They found the perfect size home for our family in a great neighborhood.  The few minor maintenance issues have been taken care of in a friendly and timely manner.  I would definitely recommend them for anyone looking for a home to rent - this company takes care of their residents.<//Review>

<text>Tiffany has been the best! Patient, accommodating, knowledgeable and above all else, welcoming!  It's been a real pleasure working with the folks at TAH. Fred, Robert and the rest of the crew were all  very professional... There's a certain level of comfort that you get working with people who sincerely seem to care about your needs and concerns. If we were looking for another home, I would start with TAH.< /text><UserId.>101651225033059621109<//UserId.>< Response>

So far Tricon gets 5 stars. We have 2 therapy dogs. All they asked for was the doctors orders. When we sent them over they were very accommodating. No issues at all.Bonnie,Gina,Yolanda and all the others were awesome.there is a $225 admin fee but I didn't mind so much because they actually treated me like I was the customer. That is really hard to find these days. I had delt with 2 other agencies b4 Tricon and they both acted like they were doing me a favor. Quite frankly they were A-holes! The house had a couple of small issues and Bonnie quickly took pics for the move in walk through to cover my butt. She even pulled the weeds in the front yard herself. Give that woman a raise. I have NEVER seen an agent do that. Thanks to all of you at Tricon for going above and beyond to make me and my wife feel like more than just another number.
Oh and to all you haters out there I have not received a single thing as compensation for this review.<//text>

We moved into our new Tricon American Home in Lake Worth, FL just yesterday. Today we got to meet Pedro who came over to do some repairs on the house. He was extremely patient with me and listened to my concerns. He made all the repairs I wanted and helped to make a few suggestions of other smaller ideas that I had while he was there. Thank you Pedro!</text>

Throughout my 3.5 years of being here, I have had minimal complaints. My leasing agent Rodney was amazing and patient showing around the Tricon properties until we found one to my liking! His personality and professionalism throughout the application process has been superb. My portfolio manager, Alicia Carroll has undoublty made my renting experience smooth sailing with her effective communication and fast responses to any requests I had. I highly recommend this property management to anyone looking for a new place to live. Thank you for a job well done and showing what customer service is all about !! You guys rock !!</text>

On May 3rd Mr. J. Krawford came out to my home on a maintenance call for my home. He was very professional, worked in a timely manner, and asked if I had any questions or concerns regarding the work he did at my home. I was satisfied with his work and should I have any upcoming maintenance requests in the future I would recommend him coming back out to handle to job.< /review>

I’ve been a tenant for 5 years, always made on time payments and have taken great care of my home,  they have made it impossible for me to transfer into a bigger/better property for my growing family. Ive been trying to get into a different property for at least 2 years now and they have never tended to the request in a timely manner. Now they are saying I can’t move because MAINTENANCE said so! Never heard of such thing, and the few maintenance requests I have had, an outside contractor has come to my home so I know these are lies. They wouldn’t even send anyone out to view my home after repeated emails and me telling them nothing is wrong with the condition of my property. Asked them to give me a call and no one ever did yet my rent continues to increase. I would go with a company that takes care of their long term tenants</Text>

This is my second year renting from Tricon American Homes. I recently put in several maintenance requests and they were all honored in a timely manner. Hurther Baker was the maintenance technician that came out to complete my requests. He was very polite, professional and answered any questions I had. He made sure I was pleased with the quality of his work before he left. Tricon American Homes is the best and Mr. Baker definitely represents them well.</Text>

We moved to Phoenix when our company transferred us from El Paso a year ago. The Phoenix area team has gone above and beyond when we need assistance or have any questions. We are moving closer to work and finding a home that met our needs literally took hours with thier help. Sarah (Buckeye home), MonaLisa, Candace (Tolleson home), and Michelle are amazing! I'm sorry if I forgot anyone as we have had amazing assistance with the whole team<//Review>

They raised our rent. They have handymann3rd party so you have to file complaint. Get a call. Don't miss it. Have someone come. Then get approved then come back to fix. No one evwr answers phone or knows whats going on. Handyman destroyed ceiling in bedroom and we won't be held liable when we move so have pics and attorney on line already. Window upstairs is not to code and almost cut off my daughters hand when it fell.... I will be ready for war with this company when we go to move out. House is cleaner after we moved in than when we moved in. When the washer and dryer got stolen after we looked at the home. They have people.who do.fake i.d.s and go inside and steal. So I am ready to find a new leasing company as we travel this country for work amd will not buy anywhere in the states.</Text>

Latoshia Bates was awesome. She worked with me every step of the way and she guided me through the entire process. Unforeseen circumstances happened that caused me to be unable to move but she made sure my refund was processed and sent out within a day of notifying me that I could no longer move in. Although I was bummed about not moving, I have to give her credit for being so honest and empathetic towards me.< /review>

I had the pleasure to work with David Dozier here in the Tampa Bay area.

***UPDATE: Nick with the regional team in the Charlotte area reached out to us and was more than helpful. Unfortunately he was away on business when the issues with the a/c happened. If he had been in office, I feel we would have not had as much of a problem. He was more than helpful and apologized for the many issues. I thank Nick for his help and his exceptional customer service.

_______

Horrible customer service to go along with a horrible rental company. Host of issues since before moving in. Should have never rented with Tricon. We’ve been in this Tricon home (in the Charlotte area) for a little over a month and it’s been issue after issue.

Currently have been without a/c for six days. Tricon had a contractor come out last Wednesday to look at it. Contractor determined it needed parts ordered and said they’d contact us in 24-48 hours. After they didn’t, we contacted the contractor and asked them what the issue was — they informed us that Tricon wouldn’t let them order the parts needed to fix the unit, leaving us without a/c for going on a week now.

We were finally able to reach Tricon this morning and they are finally sending a new contractor today. They also said they’d have the contractor send temporary units but when I spoke to the contractor, they said the work order from Tricon said nothing about that. Just to add to it when I called the maintenance line to report the issue, the Tricon employee talked down to me like I knew nothing and that the a/c issue was basically my fault. It’s been absolutely ridiculous how they’ve handled this.

Other issues:
-Were by one Tricon employee that we could move in on a Saturday and then contacted by the Tricon move in inspection employee to set up our move on Monday or Friday and to be told that we couldn’t do Saturday, even though we had email documentation that we could. After unnecessary back and forth we were able to move in on Saturday.

-Upon moving in, we found the house dirty — garage filthy with dirt, cobwebs, leftover construction debris, etc.; downstairs with muddy footprints throughout; upstairs master bathroom and been used and not cleaned (disgusting); front porch covered in dirt; etc. Even after receiving the move in email that the house had been painted cleaned, etc. before our move, it most certainly was not cleaned and some areas not painted. Tricon offered us a $125 deduction off of next month’s rent but, to no surprise, we’ve yet to see that on our account.

-We had a couple of issues we needed addressed (back fence falling over in a couple of places, the interior garage door that hadn’t been painted and the front door that was broken and dented around the handle. They told us that they’d address the issues on the Monday after we moved in — they never called and after two weeks, we called the maintenance line to ask about getting the issues fixed, still they weren’t resolved and we then had to call again to get the issues fixed.

These are summaries of our issues. I emailed the Tricon executive email to address the issues. Of course they never responded, even after a follow up email about the a/c. Can’t wait to get away from this home and away from Tricon. Take my advice and DO NOT rent with them.< /text>

Tricon has been a wonderful company to rent from for the past 2.5 years. The Houston maintenance department is very responsive whenever we have maintenance issues. The tech Jesus Alvarado is always so nice and professional. He gets things done quickly and efficiently! Two thumbs up the the maintenance team and Jesus!<//text>

<Text>just rented a home from them and it was a wonderful and easy experience.  everything was quick and efficient and everyone was very nice.  they accommodated me and my work schedule by allowing my family to do most of the requirements and all I needed to do was sign and move in.  Yolanda, Michelle,  Gina, and Candace answered all my questions sometimes at midnight.  it was a pleasure working with each one of these ladies,  I would rent again from them in a heartbeat.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Date>

<review>I haven't rented for over 40 years and the experience was quick and painless.  The home was exactly what we needed and served our purpose well.   We only have minor troubles and they were addressed and fixed within 1-2 days.  The house was well built, updated and we enjoyed the neighborhood as well.   I highly recommend Tricon American Homes for my friends and family to check out.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><time>1512431709178< /time>< user_name>

< Review>
I have had the WORST experience working with this company. DO NOT rent through them! We moved into a very nice home and on the very first day the plumbing was completely not working. All plumbing will not drain and things are leaking, etc. We had someone come look at it and they just explained how bad the plumbing is in this home and how these problems were existing. They said they would be back to help us, no one came. We have now placed 4 different work orders and called every hour for 3 days. Each time we contact, they explain to us that someone will call us back within an hour. NO ONE calls, for 3 days!! Absolutely ridiculous! This company is without doubt the worst I have worked with and am very unimpressed. We are looking to break this lease and get out of this house as soon as possible! I am hoping that this saves someone else the hassle that we are experiencing now.<//Review>

<name>T S</name>< Review>
Renting in Indiana has been very interesting compared to other states and Tricon Americans homes has made it a bit easier once we got ahold of a property manager.

We’ve lived in our home for three years and each year, they reviewed our lease to renew and each year our rent has gone up about $25-100 which is I guess reasonable comparatively.  We did have maintenance issues like normal homes do and Tricon has been pretty responsive once they receive your maintenance request.

Move out was very simple and I believe that’s because Deven Jeffries has made the process as painless as possible (outstanding service).  Our home was clean, there was normal wear and tare to the home and we got our full deposit back.  If this whole process is the same in the future, we would most likely rent with Tricon American Homes again.< /Review>

<rate>4</rate><text>Tricon bought out SilverBay and actually purchased the home I was leasing. I found them to do a pretty good job reacting to my maintenance requests and they always promptly returned my emails when I had questions. I found it easy to manage my account and make my payments through their portal. I purchased a home and had to terminate my lease early which did present a problem when I went to make my last rent payment. The Early Termination fee was included in that charge which made it impossible for me to pay in all in one lump sum. After receiving an eviction notice for non-payment I was able to talk to them and send them a check just for the Rent and Pet rent. That gave me time to complete the cleanup of the property. I did get my deposit applied to my early termination fee and did notice Tricon doing a lot of work on the home after the lease terminated. They seem to care about their properties and their tenants. My experience was good and I would recommend them.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1534437707162, 'text': 'Thank you for your recommendation and great review.

<Text>*Calling all College Students, Roommates, High rent areas, and Families** From start to finish Tricon has been great to work with. Their representatives make it easy to tour all their rentals to find what you need for your budget. The maintenance requests are effortless and completed timely. Their rental prices are decent for high rent areas and they surpass apartments. We have truly enjoyed being a resident and I recommend anyone to reach out to them to tour any of their open rentals. They are one major choice in the rental community that I wish I had found many years ago to save me from moving around in my college years.

<review>Delvin and Jerry have each been to my residence twice on different issues.   I have had various other techs working on other issues and none have been as friendly, neat and thorough as these 2.  Delvin took the time to explain what the issue was and let me know Jerry was coming to help fix it.   He then explained everything they did to fix the issue, prevent mildew/ mold from growing and clean up.   Great job and thank you guys!</review>< Rating>

<Text>I rented 311 May Oak Rd.Columbia SC. This company is a bad joke. They are so helpful when you 1st apply but once you sign those papers it all goes down hill from there. Our issues started day 1, The signing agent was late letting us in the home. The neighbors ran into my truck and left the scene of the accident. When we finally got in the home, the basement was exposed and leaking water.  It took 6 months for them to send a repair guy who couldn't fix the issue and another 3 months for the repair which to this day is still not fixed. There is an awful smell coming from the basement which made it embarrassing for me to have visitors over. There was a roach infestation that my fiance and I had to remedy at our own expense. Because of the basement issues lizards and birds would enter the home and the electric bill is grossly expensive because the home is not conserving energy property. I eventually was evicted because I couldn't afford light bills as high as the rent and if I paid 1 the other would have to be late. Oh and keep in mind if you are 10 days late the Sheriff will be knocking at you door to evict you. I would recommend trying to exhaust every other option before signing with this company. It's unfortunate that they are buying up all the properties in the city because they are slum lords posing as a reputable company.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1520973490541, 'text': 'We appreciate you taking the time to express your concerns.

{'time': 1565304402083, 'text': 'Michael Warren, we are sorry to hear you are disappointed with Tricon American Homes. Upon submission of the rental application, you agreed to the Company’s Terms of Agreement as well as paid a $45 non-refundable application fee per applicant and a $250 non-refundable holding deposit.  Our non-refundable holding deposit is in place as a formal expression of intent to acknowledge the prospective resident’s hold on a home while the application is processed. Due to the home being pulled off the market, and no longer being available to other prospective residents, the holding fee is a gesture of good will between the interested prospective resident and Tricon American Homes.  We have reviewed our call records, and found that our application team did speak with you about the return of your holding fee and informed you that because of a quick denial, the $250 was never withdrawn. Additionally, our Applications Specialist supervisor has also reached out to clarify this with you. We thank you for considering Tricon American Homes in your rental search and wish you the best in finding a new home.'}< /Resp>
< review>
My name is Michael Warren I applied for a home in Indianapolis IN 4015 steelwater Dr, and I didn't get approved, which is fine. When I asked how long it would take to receive my $250 holding fee back I was told 3-5 business days. It has now been 7 business days and I haven't received anything back. I'ved called several times and they keep telling me the same thing "it says it was sent back to you, but I can have my supervisor call you when she gets in" I have yet to receive a call.

I really don't even understand why there is a holding fee if you don't even know if I'm going to get approved or not, makes no sense to me. Day by day I'm feeling more and more like this company truly scammed me. I would never recommend this place.<//review>

Just love my guy, Dracie, who came out today to handle multiple maintenance requests for Tricon. Very professional, calm, polite, checked that everything was done correctly, cleaned up afterwards. I REALLY appreciate him!
Also behind-the-scenes, Mabel was very quick to get me on the schedule before the 4th of July holiday craziness. Thank you!< /Review>

Recently moved to a house managed by Tricon Homes here in California. I am so happy and thankful with Maritza of Tricon Homes for helping me all through out the process of applying and moving in to my new home. She knows how difficult and stressful it is to look out and find a place to stay here in the Bay Area/East Bay. Took only two days to get the approval for the rental application then after 2 weeks I already moved in to my new home. Thank you so much Tricon Homes specially to you Maritza!<//Review>

Great experience from the ease of the move in to quick response of the very few maintenance issues I have had in my home. The customer service from the manager on down to anyone I have talked to about anything has been nothing less than A-1. Tri-Con made my transition back home to Columbia, SC from Texas very easy. I would definitely recommend to all my family and friends. Great company ! Keep up the great work!< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I have nothing but good things to say about tricon American homes. Any issues I've had were quickly resolved. Maintenance was done in a timely fashion. All I had to do is ask. I want to personally thank Alicia Carroll, as she has been our personal contact from day one. Very courteous and willing to go out of her way for her clients. I would advise you to speak to her her specifically if you are going to use this company. It is pretty much guaranteed your service will be excellent and more than what you expect.<//review>< pictures>

I submitted a maintenance request and received a new kitchen faucet.  Jason called me to advise of his anticipated arrival time.  Not only did he arrive promptly...but he finished early as well.  The only evidence of the exchange was a shinny new kitchen faucet!  He removed all trash and unwanted materials upon completion of the install.  Remember fellow residents dealing with Tricon American Homes Dallas Texas....Jason is your man for repairs!  And Tricon American Homes is the place to go for your next new home!</review>

<text>This review is long over due!  After two months being in my home, I can finally say I am very close to settled. However I needed to take the time to say THANK YOU to Sam who was my guide on the day I came to pick up my keys! He answered every question I had (even the annoying ones). There were a few things that needed to be replaced/fixed and he made sure that Chas would come the very next day to handle it. Both Sam and Chas were extremely professional and patient. Thanks to the entire team for helping me with my moving process from NJ to NC.</text>< pictures>

I had the greatest experience with Tiffany! I have never rented a home this way (online), so I was pretty sceptical. Tiffany eased my concerns and reassured me. She held my hand through the process and never left me with unanswered questions. She even answered the phone for me SICK!!! If that isn't dedication, I don't know what is. Oh, and the home is BEAUTIFUL!!!! I'm so happy!!!! Thanks Tiffany, I doubt anybody could have done it better!!! I would give you 10 stars if I could!!!!<//review>

David assisted me with the entire walkthrough process and it was really great. Many companies focus on the basics. He didn’t!! He actually took it to the next level making sure I understood All of the proper functions such as water shut off location, water heater functions, and etc. It was a pleasure working with someone who enjoys their job and a great representation of what a rental company should stand for!!! Thank you!

I recently moved in and has an issue with my dish washer. Maintenance request really shows how committed a company is. My request was handled the next day! Mr James Crawford cake in and handled my request in no time!  Very professional!!! Thank you!!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I have been a resident with you guys for nearly 6 years. Dawn has been absolutely fabulous and handling my business over the time. When it came time for us to think about moving, I was in the middle of my mothers passing and She could not have been more helpful or professional!
I just wanted to say that I highly regard your professionalism and your persona. You were very easy to work with and made this very difficult time in our life very easy to handle. A relationship with Silver Bay, now Tricon homes, has been great.
Thank you so much for accommodating us during this time of loss with our family.

I called Tricon yesterday afternoon to have someone to come put and check on an ant problem for me and to also have some blinds installed in my 2nd bedroom. The appointment was scheduled for today from 1pm to 5pm. Around 1130, I received a call from John Encarnacion (had to get the gentleman's name to commend him of his professionalism) stating that he was 5 minutes away and that he would be here shortly. Upon arrival, we did a quick walk through and from there, he was able to address my concerns and offered an immediate solution.

Thanks again John for your professionalism and expertise.< /Text>

<Name>Olivia< /Name><Date>1530563646862<//Date><Rate>5</Rate><Text>David Dozier was the first friendly face we dealt with while searching for a rental home in the Tampa Area for Tricon homes. He was very responsive from the moment I inquired about a listing. He agreed to take us to look at other homes that weekend, along with the rental I inquired about. Since most homes at Tricon are self show, we decided to get a head start and look at the home that Thursday instead (the main one we wanted to see), since we realize properties go fast this time of year. We let Dave know and he called immediately and let us know he would meet us there since he was on his way home from showing another house and lived near by. We thought that was very admirable of him since it was 7:30 when we went! Dave was funny, honest, and straightforward. He made sure we understood how Tricon's application process worked so there were no surprises! We bothered Dave a few more times after we discovered we were approved for house so my other roommate could look at the property and he agreed to come by again on a rainy Sunday afternoon! My point being Dave Dozier was a pleasure to work with...he was constantly accessible, very prompt, and made himself the most available out of any other real estate agent I worked with in the past. Also, Marjorie Menhoff the portfolio manager has also made the move in process easy. Very prompt with her responses and has answered any questions we have had with move-in thus far.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1530651254690, 'text': 'Thank you Olivia.

<name>Tim Reid<//name><time>1540365736077</time><rating>1</rating><review>Tricon does not value relationships. Check their properties on Zillow to find out how long their places stay on the market. They are losing money so to make up for that they are raising current tenants rents greatly.

Do not use them as a property manager for your home as you are sure to lose money while your house sits vacant. Don't take my word for it. Research them and you will get a better picture. They cannot be trusted.

As a tenant, you deserve to deal with a landlord that at least follows state laws. With Tricon you can be sure they will try to pull a fast one on you. If you notice anything that may be in violation of your rights Google - Tenant Rights Lawyer Free Consultation and your city name and talk to a lawyer.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1536338636583, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

I had MANY difficulties during the transition between Silverbay and Tricon.  However, I was fortunate enough to deal with Ruby Baker.  Ruby not only excels in her position, but is a very warm, kind and personable human being, who will walk the extra mile to please and offer excellent customer service.  In a world where people are just numbers, it's very refreshing to know that there are still individuals as Ruby who are immensely efficient, responsible, caring and truly love their job.  Thank you Ruby for turning a bad experience into a very hopeful one with Tricon.<//review>

I recently signed with this company and they are excellent with their customer service and making sure the client is happy. From start to finish they made it an easy process to move in. Mike Nazarian did an awesome job with the walk through and making sure everything was addressed and detailed! Mike also made the finalization a breeze. All the questions and concerns were not an issue for him to solve and help me with. I recommend this company 100%. Thank you!< /Review>

This has been the worst experience ever! I was approved with tricon for a home however once I signed the lease for the home I applied for I get a call stating one of their current residence has requested this home and basically I need to pick another one.

Despite the fact this is a huge inconvenience to my family and I now I have to look for another home through them. When I go back to the website the home is back available for someone else to apply for. They are losing my trust!< /text>

Tricon Homes have made me very happy since being here. Its primarily because of hard workers like Mr. DONALD BACCUS. Mr. Baccus helped me so much. He's fantastic with his customer service skills and I was very impressed. Tricon is very lucky to have such an outstanding person on their team. Thanks again so much Mr. Baccus.

<review>$720 to have a dog is really high.  ($35/mo + $300 fee).   You have to get renter's insurance and name Tricon as an additional insured.  You have 48 hours to sign a lease after approval, or you forfeit your $250 holding fee.  SO many terms, conditions, fees, requirements, etc.  I'm a single guy and make $75k+/year in South Carolina, never been late on rent ever.  I looked into a couple of Tricon homes here, and all these requirements are pretty costly and onerous.  FYI, if your home rental company has a 16-page terms document to read before renting, you might consider other options.  For the foregoing reasons, I'll pass on Tricon properties.

Also FYI, they give gift cards and/or other incentives for positive reviews.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

TRICON American Homes is truly amazing. I have lived in one of their beautiful homes for 3 years and have never had a problem. Any minor issues I’ve had have been taken care of right away with their maintenance team. Recently I found myself needing to down size and had trouble finding another place that would accept my 2 big dogs. Wendy My property manager along with Todd, Brian and Ruby have been so amazing through the years and Wendy went out of her way to work with me and help me with one of their smaller homes to move into because I didn’t want to leave them and go anywhere else. I strongly recommend TRICON and can say they really do care about the people and families that rent from TRICON.< /Review>

For 2 1/2 years, I rented one of the homes in Jacksonville, FL.  Throughout that time, I received prompt attention from the great staff at Tricon, and I could not have asked for better service from their property management and maintenance staff.  When the home was heavily damaged from Hurricane Irma, Dawn Jones was instrumental in helping me through the unexpected and difficult crisis.  Her professionalism and compassion are a great reflection for the values that Tricon has for their tenants.<//Text>

I wasn't "charged an early termination due to breaking my lease," I paid a fee, which is clearly allowed and defined in my lease agreement -- because I needed to move. Nice straw man. I was happy to move out because management is dreadful, we had mold/mildew taking over a leaking laundry room, and also plumbing issues for months. Thank you for letting me clarify.</Text>

< Review>
we finally purchased a house and we were moving out early, we followed the rules and put in a notice like it states and paid for the time we were not living there to match the paperwork, then we get a moving out early violation  for the total monthly bill since the contract was for 1 more month. After talking with them multiple times the amount changes  multiple times and stops at $400 since we got tired of going back and forth and arguing and we agree to pay on $50 a month. Now they want it paid in full in 2 days or they are sending me to collections,  so i am going to collections for $200 if not paid in full in 2 days.I would not encourage anyone to rent from this company they are crooked and only care about the $, also they do have cheap contractors do their work. never again will I rent from this company and i encourage you not to either there is many other rental companies</Review>

Thanks TAH for your easy and straight process to get a home. My family is happy with your process and protocol to rent a home with you.
The superintendent SAM during the Move-in inspection was very nice and made notes of all issues found that day. He explained in details everything about the house and how we should keep it as well as how to make an order for maintenance.
By now, we are enjoying living in a home of TAH.< /Review>

We have had nothing but great service from Tricon!  The house is beautiful and in a great neighborhood.  It was updated before we moved in.  Due to no fault of their own, the AC had to be replaced and they worked very fast to work us in and get us up and running in the heat of the summer, even compensating us for the time we were out of the house.

When glue started coming through the floor seams, they had it cleaned up a few times.  When it continued to happen, they sent their head of maintenance out and then the owner of the flooring company.  Tricon replaced the entire downstairs floor with an even better quality floor.

The service persons have been nothing but polite and helpful.  The office has been in constant contact to check on things.  They even accidentally checked on the lease that the company would be doing landscaping when it was supposed to be the renter...they are going to honor the lease and make sure the lawn get mowed!

I would recommend them to anyone...this Indianapolis crew knows what they are doing and how to keep their tenants happy:)  Thanks Jessica, Nick and everyone whose names I'm forgetting!< /review>

< Review>
My experience with Tricon American Homes ended terribly. My family and I rented multiple homes with them for 4 years before we finalized on our home purchase in March 2019. We only stayed with them for convenience because they were a big company with lots of properties throughout GA to choose from and we decided to try different areas initially each year in order to conclude on where we want to purchase our home. The last home we rented from them, we ended up staying for 2 years. The company was just okay when it came to customer and providing maintenance support, until our last year, when we experienced how terrible they actual were. There was a leak in the home that lead to harmful and very active mildew and mold growth in our kitchen. It took them months before they finally resolved the leak, then even longer before they even attempted to take of the mold. Ultimately they never resolved the mold completely, the vendor they hired Trison Management was useless. We called, complained, submitted photos and literally got no where. It was absolutely astonishing.  We couldnt wait to close on our home and move out, because of the unsafe mold environment for ourselves and children. They did not care, the several people I spoke to were rude, and impersonal. They left us with no kitchen for almost 2 months in a failed attempt to remove the mold. The rude Tricon rep we spoke to, I think her name was Dawn, only offered a $60 credit towards our rent for the inconvenience. It would take me pages to breakdown the whole story. Finally when we were getting ready to move out the rude and impersonal Shanae Wiggins saw the pictures of the terrible mold and water damage throughout the kitchen and confirmed that we would not be liable at move out, that it was expected wear and tear. She didn't even care that we had to stay in such conditions. When we moved out they ended up still trying to keep our desposit and charge us for more money relating to the mold and water damage, that they NEVER RESOLVED. Eventually a reasonable person Anthony helped us in that area and got us back only part of our deposit. From everyone we corresponded on issues with, Anthony was the only one who showed patience and customer service.  Unless you want to deal with people that see you as just another tenant, only care about profits and lacks customer service, then I absolutely do not recommend this company.< /Review>

As you are aware, once we were made aware of the leak underneath the sink, a technician was dispatched to assess the situation.

Though there were some unforeseen delays, the work was in fact completed. Regarding the charges at move out, unfortunately the condition of the home was left beyond normal wear and tear. Damages to the home were paid directly from the security deposit and the remainder was returned to you. We thank you for reaching out and allowing us an opportunity to clarify.

I must confess that I was a little leary of renting from Tricon after reading all the negative reviews. But my personal experience from initially renting a home from Tricon in the Atlanta area has gone quite well. Customer service was great and my total move in experience has gone quite well. My initial walk through issues are being addressed and corrected by various contractors within a reasonable amount of time.
I love my new home and I'm settling in quite well.< /review>

It has been a wonderful experience renting with Tricon American Homes! My house had a TON of maintenance issues whenever I moved in and they fixed everything at no cost. Every time that I had an issue and reached out to the Tricon team in my area they took care of my issue in a reasonable amount of time. I'm unfortunately moving to an area where they don't have homes available for rent but I'll definitely use them again if I'm in an area that does.<//Text>

<Text>Didn’t have A/C for a week because they blame for our filter was not swap. After swapping the filter, no air was blowing and have to open the windows for a week. Due to high temperature our ac died again on the hot weather. Call tricon maintenance to see if we can get someone early morning to fix it but say that they call back but dis not call. We got it fixed last Friday but today the ac have to stop out of no where because tricon have to approve for the maintenance to be approve. Kinda disappoint how they do not send anyone immediately when the weather is in the 90s.<//Text><rating>3< /rating>< pics>

I have been without A/C going on  3 days. Now it is Saturday June 24, 2017. This house is  is very, very HOT and uncomfortable. No one should have to live like this. In this unit right now it is over 100 degree's. I feel like i am going to die I am so hot. Tricon American  homes, they are working on my problem. In the meantime I am getting sick from the extensive heat. Please pray for me. I feel there will be no hope for me. I will have to call 911 for help, I am so very hot and sick with my many health problems.<//review>

I'll just mention how they've sent maintenance out 3x for the same thing in 2-3 months for a simple repair and it's still not been fixed yet. They're unorganized. New guy comes in and doesn't know why every time. It's frustrating.< /Text>

We began leasing from Silver Bay in 2015 and never had any problems until Tricon bought our house. Communication was horrible. We would call and be told someone would contact us but weeks would pass by with no response. We sent letters, emails, and finally facebook messages and still took a long time just to get a response to simple questions. We moved last month. Our lease ended on 4/8/2019 but Tricon said they couldn't come get the keys until 4/9/2019 and we would not be charged for the extra day. We paid for the 8 days and are waiting on our deposit to be returned. I checked our account and they have added a charge for another day even though they said they wouldn't because it was their fault! Of course no one bothered to tell us there was an extra charge and now we have to go through the whole communication fiasco once more to get this straightened out.

If you are considering Tricon, believe the negative reviews and go elsewhere!<//text>

I applied for a house and got approve on the 19th for that suppose to be ready by the 21st. I did not recieve a phone call or email about my next steps. So I thought made I needed to wait until the 21st and someone would call still nothing . I made a phone to ask what was I suppose to next as far as paying the security deposit and my move in date. They told me to wait for an email. Well here we are a week later and still nothing. This is ridiculous being that I have to move in a couple from my current location because my lease is up. Everything was going just fine when it came to taking my money for the holding fee but now I can't even get an email with a real answer. It is very unprofessional to keep a customer in the dark.<//Text>

<Review>I have been with Tricon for almost 3 years now and have found the Houston maintenance team excellent to deal with and gets everything dealt with quickly, promptly, and correctly the first time. Tara goes above and beyond to ensure any requests get dealt with most efficiently and always has the most amazing attitude. The service Tara Blazile gives the tenants is nothing short of amazing!

I just moved in into the home I found, so I can't comment on the timeliness of repairs /maintenance etc, but I wanted to say that the realtor that helped me move in, Brian holzwarth, was extremely professional, timely , informative and helpful throughout the entire process. If you have him as your realtor for the rental property, rest assured you are in good hands.<//Review>

Spoke to a leasing agent.  She assured me that we would be approved based on how high our income was, our rental credit is great and no issues with background.

Got an emailed and DENIED with no explination and they took the $340 out of my account with no explination.

We feel lied to by the leasing agent and now our funds are gone.

Not happy!!!  We just want a home!</text>

<text>I haven't really had to deal with them much since they purchased Silverbay, but the "Maintenance staff" had been utterly embarrassing. I've had the same person come twice because I have a toilet that has a slow leak causing it to run off and on all day and all night hence my water bill being sky high... The maintenance guy just left and guess what's still running. I also have a stand up shower that the water seal was faulty upon moving in causing large amounts of water to puddle in the floor. Would you believe the maintenance man GLUED AND TAPED a piece of plastic to the bottom of the shower and called that a fix??? My backyard, when moving in wasn't grown in. Now that the weather has blossoms all the lovely weeds my backyard (which was a determining factor of us moving here) is RIDDEN with poison ivy. It's all over the trees, growing from the ground as plants, it's TERRIBLE!! I breastfeed a baby and my boyfriend has a health issue that places us at risk for spraying (at our own expense) and a landscaper has quoted us HUNDREDS of dollars. So much for the fenced in backyard... This maintenance HAS to be a joke, I have to turn my toilet off because it can't seem to get fixed</text>< Pics>

<text>I have been a Tricon resident for 3 years and I have only wonderful things to say about Tricon and where I believe they are headed. The Vice President himself, Alan O'Brien, has even worked with me in the past regarding maintenance and leasing options. Mr. O'Brien sympathized with my family and I and showed us nothing but kindness and a true sense of customer appreciation. Despite his busy schedule, he never made me feel that my requests were bothersome and he always made sure to follow up. Since my first encounters with Mr. O'Brien, I noticed that all Tricon employees were being held to a higher standard. When I make maintenance requests, the Tricon team ensures that the work is being completed timely and to the customers satisfaction. It is admirable that a vice president is willing to do what other employees are doing and lead by example. My experiences with Tricon have taught me what a positive effect good leadership has on a company as a whole. I would also like to give recognition to Marc Munoz, the director of property management for his cheerful demeanor and expediency, as well as Cindy Smith for her attentiveness.<//text>< Pictures>

I have mixed reviews here. First I want to say that the maintenance department workers are wonderful. Specifically Hurther Baker from the Charlotte office was professional and quick to respond.

But I have reservations about the company office. They have not paid the HOA fees since the beginning of 2018. Now the home I rent is facing foreclosure. Getting information is proving to be difficult.< /Text>

We lived in a Tricon home, in Clearwater FL, for 4 years. They were very quick to get any major maintenance issues fixed. After Hurricane Irma they were pretty quick to have someone out to fix the fence (our only damage thankfully).  My only negative would be the rent hikes each year.  When we moved for work related reasons, we tried to find a Tricon home in our new area but none were available. Overall a good experience.< /review>

<Review>My fiancé and I recently applied to rent out a home through Tricon American Homes. She was initially told by Miriam, who is I'm assuming the person assigned to the house, that there would be an issue validating her proof of income as she is a bartender. This is understandable especially with bartenders not getting paystubs to prove their income. The problem arises from being told that we have 3 pets. Which keeps us from renting the home because they only allow 2 pets. I have a registered and fully documented service animal that they are considering to be a pet. This company is refusing to allow us to move in because that would put three 'pets' in our home. After speaking with Miriam, and getting quite upset myself over being told that she has a service animal and the ONLY thing that the the paperwork helps with is to avoid pet fees. Hearing this infuriated me, because I took this to imply that the only reason I have my service dog is to avoid pet fees. Her ignorance and attitude that she was doing us a favor and allowing an exception to allow my fiancé's bank statements for proof of income as opposed to check stubs, and that she or the company couldn't allow any other 'exceptions' is unbelievable. I highly suggest not renting through these people.</Review>< Name>

< review>
We began leasing from Silver Bay in 2015 and never had any problems until Tricon bought our house. Communication was horrible. We would call and be told someone would contact us but weeks would pass by with no response. We sent letters, emails, and finally facebook messages and still took a long time just to get a response to simple questions. We moved last month. Our lease ended on 4/8/2019 but Tricon said they couldn't come get the keys until 4/9/2019 and we would not be charged for the extra day. We paid for the 8 days and are waiting on our deposit to be returned. I checked our account and they have added a charge for another day even though they said they wouldn't because it was their fault! Of course no one bothered to tell us there was an extra charge and now we have to go through the whole communication fiasco once more to get this straightened out.

If you are considering Tricon, believe the negative reviews and go elsewhere!</review>

Hi,
I would like to thank your company personnel at the maintenance department for their excellent service provided; after hurricane Irma passed through Tampa and blow away the pool screen, tilt the fence and some issues with the pool at this property, your maintenance Manager Julian Ospina, provided timely and helpful service plus immense input in getting all the matters resolved. The ability to provide the resolution quickly exceeded my expectations. I would especially like to commend Julian for his professionalism and superlative skills.
Definitely I would recommend Tricon American Homes to anyone who is looking to rent a nice home from a great company.

Update
This month I had an HOA violation and as many of you know these can be huge headaches..Well Diana Fuentes helped me through entire process which was extremely aggravated by rude service at the HOA approved paint store. I really appreciate the staff at Tricon. I continue to be impressed by the commitment to get it done. FIRST MABEL NOW I have Diana!!!

2 months ago-I have been with this company for over 7 years and the staff is always awesome. Mabel Rosario always assists me with my maintenance requests and the repairs are always immediate. I appreciate all that she does. The fence looks great and the Tricon repair man did an excellent job.<//review>

We have been renting the house for 3 years now and have nothing but problems. A pipe breaking in the middle of winter last year. It took them  days to turn our water and heaters back on with 2 small kids it was hard. Now this year with our rent going even higher they can not do any of the repairs we request. We had a roof leak and our ceiling fell, Asbestos and mold, a huge power bill and close to impossible for them to get back to us. I have never had anyone from the company coming out to help us just the workers they send. So we have to leave our jobs to let them in. So unprofessional and I hope nobody else has a problem like this. Cant wait to get out of the house!<//text>< Rating>

<Review>Absolute great experience from start to finish! When we met John on move in day, he was kind very informative. Made it a very easy transition, we absolutely loved our home at 4717 lodestone dr, tampa. Was perfect for our needs. We had moved down from Maine in Aug 2018. Then we had some family things in Maine to take care of so July 2019 we had to leave our home in Tampa. Then again John was our pre move out contact  and he was awsome. I would absolutely rent fromTricon again. Thank you Tricon!!!</Review><date>1564142534419</date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>DO NOT BUY OR RENT A HOUSE FROM THIS PLACE!!! We are currently going through a nightmare with them. First the A/C broke then we started having symptoms of mold exposure. They sent out their maintenance team who was clueless about mold and even said we would have to fight with the property management because "they probably won't do anything since it's so expensive." They refused to do anything so we hired our own inspector. Black mold was found but now they're saying it's not malicious. IT'S BLACK MOLD!! Just don't waste your time. Go with someone else.< /Review><Time>1531444098007<//Time>< gmapID>

<user_id>106065955126165836202<//user_id><text>Absolute worst company ever. They send out all different kind of random maintenance people to do work, which they patch up and they end up having to send others out to re-fix what was patched up. They say if you have an emergency that they will send out someone from maintenance once again you wait for days to have things repaired like ac units that contiously need repairing. The ceiling in one of the bedrooms fell partially in do to water damage it took days for maintenance to come out and repair. There were no room blinds when I moved in and they charged me for them when I moved out. They charge you for painting the home when you move out. When you put cheap matte based paint on a wall in a home please don't expect to not repaint it after tenants have been there for a year. They charge you for the same thing multiple times like painting the home $364.00, Carpet $250.00, Cleaning 250.00 all this falls under the same section of the lease that says cleaning. They then told a complete lie that my front door was kicked in and charged me 160.00 for some maintenance people to come out and patch it up once again. This is the absolute worst company ever. don't ever rent from them. They never call you back when you contact them. They charged me 70.00 for 2 blinds that are $5.00 in stores. if i could give zero stars I would. Also I tried to transfer to another home because of the area and they wouldn't let me so I suffered the worst time ever of my life in just 1 year.They also charged me for a smoke detector that was knocked down by a ladder from a patch up maintenance worker once again. Charged me for a vertical blind that was patched up by a maintenance worker who they got rid of admitting that he patched up lots of maintenance jobs that they had him to do. This company took my entire $900.00 deposit and my balance ended up being 1256.00 this was not right at all. Take some responsibility for being a rental company and don't expect a brand new home when a tenant moves out. I stayed in my last home for 11 years and got my entire deposit back. So tell me who's at fault.< /text><username>Theresa Shepard<//username>< date>

<Text>I never EVER do this, and this is technically my gf’s lease but I live there and pay the bills. No idea what Tricon is like elsewhere, but in Charlotte they are the most unprofessional and racist people ever. They spend more time explain why they can’t fix something than doing work. Do work! This house is falling apart!!! People in California say they’ll fix it no problem, but the local boys say no. The fridge can’t keep ice cubes frozen, and won’t stay shut - the main shower is about to collapse and hurt someone the floor is so water damaged. The tech comes out, says I’m right, but their boss don’t let them help “people like you in areas like this”. Minorties get the shaft. Nick in Charlotte who IS a supervisor, they claim, is useless and rude, said we damaged both. How would, why would we do that. Patrick who they claim is his boss REFUSED to talk to me!

Poor Experience. The initial stages started well, inquired about a home we liked and met with a live leasing agent who showed us the home and answered questions we had. Set expectation about hold fees and pet fees during the initial visit.

After applying and being approved the leasing agent and other management persons shifted their sole purpose to money and money only and simply stopped caring about customer needs.

From the initial showing of the property to being approved, no more than a week had passed. The holding fees and pet fees we had expected from our initial visit were told to us differently after approval. After being informed it would cost more for our four legged family members to live with us (pet) and the hold associated with the pet was a lot more the company had no interest in honoring what their leasing agent was advertising. Additionally the leasing agent mentioned getting holds back but management said "oh no no no!" and did not provide us with our hold.

Overall- the leasing agent seems to provide to good to be true information to lure a customer in, then once approved they backfire and do not honor anything originally advertised. Please beware as this is a company false advertising as well as quick to nickel and dime their clients.<//review>

I am starting my third year in a Tricon home. They are very professional managers, and their Maintenance Crew is the best! James Crawford handles most of my maintenance. He is prompt, very pleasant, and the home repair whiz kid. I looked at other homes before renewing my lease, and was apalled at the condition they were in. Thanks Tricon & James!< /Review>

I recently became a resident with Tricon American Homes and have had a wonderful experience from answering questions about the process to move in to maintenance requests. When I did my walk through of my home, Josh Suitt was very helpful in answering all of my questions (even ones I didn't know to ask). He made sure that I was very aware of everything throughout the entire process. I reached out to him the day after I moved in about a maintenance issue and Josh came out personally to get it fixed within hours of receiving my call. I have been very pleased with working with Josh and Tricon throughout this whole moving process. They have definitely made, what would normally, be a stressful situation very seamless and streamlined. Thanks Josh!< /Text>

<text>Absolutely dissatisfied with the customer service and respect of this company in the Indianapolis Area. 9 months into a lease and its been hell getting them to treat repeated maintenance requests. My favorite part is, the recent mandated Renters Insurance they took it upon themselves to add into our rent payment, even after we have submitted a year paid in full policy of coverage from state farm at lease signing... At least we are now double covered, right?
We are still dealing with a ''rotten egg'' odor coming from our well water that was reported when we moved in, reported several times and it remains unfixed.

***update 3/11/19:  This original Google review resulted in expedited attention from Tricon. Janet reached out within 36 hours by phone and via text and immediately began working to resolve issues. She has been the first and only pleasant experience with Tricon AH. Unfortunately,  no fault of hers seemingly, issues remain with the water quality and condition however she is continuing to work with various contractors in attempt to provide quality water. We have requested to terminate our lease so they can repair the home and lease it to a new family.<//text>< Rating>

What a pleasant professional experience I was given; James was personable from the beginning of our interaction to the end & went right to work on things that needed repairing. I am pleased with the work administered & the time he took to make sure the job was done proficiently. James exemplified the expiedency in which all customer servers should aspire.< /Text>

I would give this company 1 star if it wasn't for Alainna going to bat for us. We applied for a home and a week goes by. The only contact we received was an email stating our application has been received and being review, someone should get back to us soon. We called Tricon and was told that no one picked up our application but looked at it now. We were approved, but the home we applied for was already taken. I asked if we could move our application to another house and I was told the $250  holding fee would be forfeit if we did that. I objected but proceeded with the application move anyway.

Two days go by, no contact. I called the office and was told by a very nice lady whose name escapes me that we were approved for the new home and they would not only refund the $250, but also the $90 in application fees. She asked me when we would like to move it and I told her Friday, July 12th, 2018.

I asked how to pay the rent and was advised to go to their Rent Cafe Portal, create the account and sign in. When I did, it showed an old address that I rented 2 years ago. I called Alainna and she advised me to send a money order to the office and where to send the proof of payment to while the money order is in transit. She stated not to pay on the portal since it shows the wrong address that way another company does not receive my payment. I didn't want to do it this way, but fair enough.

We then receive another call from Alainna the next day stating that everything is set and we can obtain the keys on Friday and someone would be in contact with us.

Friday comes, no call, no email, nothing. I called Tricon on my lunch and was told that he sees the request and a local rep would reach out to us. Again, no call. Here it is now 5 PM on Friday and we have no keys. I call Alainna who gets in touch with the property manager Fred, and he states our move in is scheduled for Monday, July 15th, not Friday.

However, we have emails and documents stating, "Move in date: Friday, July 12th, 2019." He stated he would get back with us. Approximately 2 hours go by, nothing. My wife calls him back and again says, "I was told your move in date was Monday, not Friday!" I then took over the phone call and advised Fred that we have movers coming tomorrow morning at 8 AM. I also stated I'm looking at an email stating "Move in date: FRIDAY, July 12th, 2019." I forwarded him the email and he apologized for the "lack of communication" and provided us the code to the box to get into the house.

We move in Saturday, life is great... or so we thought.

I then receive a call from Rachel (who goes by "Sofia") stating that they have not received payment from us and asked when they are going to receive it. I told her what Alainna advised us and she very rudely told me, "that's not the correct way, you needed to pay through the portal. You can't move in until we receive payment." I told her that I sent payment via certified mail, why I didn't pay on the portal and told her we already have the keys and moved in per Fred.

I logged into the portal to check how much is owed on Thursday, July 25th and it still showed the incorrect address. I did not have a chance to log in Friday to check. I log into the portal again on Sunday, July 28th and it showed the correct address and the incorrect amount. It stated we owed WAY more than we should.

I then checked the tracking on certified mail, still in transit. Tricon was supposed to receive the payment on July 15th. Sofia stated on the phone to me on July 15th, "as long as we receive payment today you're good." Okay, then why wasn't I contacted when payment wasn't received? Where was the communication with the tenant? Why did it take so long for my address to be corrected? If Sofia was so concerned about their payment, why wasn't I notified by her that payment was not received?

In short, Tricon has a complete LACK of internal communication. Alainna did everything in her power to keep us in our home. And with her professional assistance, we are staying!

There's more to this story but Google limits characters.</review>

DO NOT RENT FROM TRICON AMERICAN HOMES!!! THEY WILL TRAP YOU!!! I HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE ALL MORNING!!! WE HAVE LEASED A TRICON PROPERTY NOW FOR OVER 4 YEARS AND NOW WANT TO MOVE. AND INFORMED TRICON IN MAY. LITERALLY OUR LAST STEP IS A RENTAL REFERENCE THAT THE NEXT RENTAL COMPANY FAXED IN TO TRICON YESTERDAY FOR TRICON TO FILL OUT AND FAX BACK. TRICON FAXED IT BACK SAYING THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE RENTERS INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES. WTF??! I HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH TRICON CORPORATE OFFICE ALL MORNING AND AFTERNOON THEY WILL NOT BUDGE! EVEN AFTER I TOLD THEM WE ARE ALL PACKED AND NEED THIS FORM FILLED OUT SIGNED AND FAXED BACK TODAY!!! TODAY IS OUR DEADLINE!!! NO COMPLIANCE!!! I THEN BEGGED THEM WITH MY PERMISSION VERBAL AND WRITTEN CAN THEY FILL OUT THE RENTAL REFERENCE  AND GIVE IT TO ME. THEY REFUSED SAYING NO, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T COME FROM ME. I ASKED FOR SOMONE ELSE AND SUPPOSEDLY THE SUPERVISOR SAID THEY HAVE THEIR RULES AND ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RELEASE ANY RENTERS INFORMATION. I PLEADED FOR THEM TO TELL ME WHAT IS THE FORM ASKING!!! THE QUESTIONS ARE, DO WE USE A LOT OF WATER?   (IN WHICH WE PAY OUR OWN WATER BY THE WAY), ARE WE GOOD RENTERS?,  ARE WE RELATED TO THE COMPANY?,  DO WE PAY ON TIME?

VALID QUESTIONS!!! HOW CAN YOU NOT AGREE TO ANSWER A RENTERS REFERENCE FORM!!??? THEY ARE FLAT OUT REFUSING THEREFORE TRAPPING US HERE AT THEIR PROPERTY!!!! ESPECIALLY SINCE OUR LEASE IS UP WITH TRICON ON JUNE 30TH AND IF WE DO NOT RENEW WE HAVE TO GO MONTH TO MONTH FOR $200 MORE ON TOP OF A RENT INCREASE!!! HAVE GOTTEN MY ATTORNEYS INVOLVED AND I AM TAKING ACTION AGAINST TRICON AMERICA HOMES!!! WE WAN’T OUT!!!  AND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ENOUGH SPACE ON HERE TO GET INTO OUR PAST GRIEVANCES!!!<//text>

I have been with Tricon almost 2 years now, I absolutely love them. This is the best company to rent from. Everything is fixed on time when needed. I personally love Lenette Moore’s attitude when I email. She is prompt, polite and has the answer. This was supposed to be just about Ms. Moore because I truly appreciate her she explains everything, but since I start typing and I talk to much I will mention the others I have enjoyed working with Jennifer Hausman and Robert Morrison. Thank you Tricon for a great team and thank you soooooo much Ms. Moore for always answering.</review>

John Encarnacion was amazing with going over and completing everything that needed to be done around the home! He was quick, extremely polite and super informative! In the past I've dreaded dealing with any type of matience being done to a home I've rented in the past with different rental agencies but he made me feel secure that Tricon American homes does care to help you and wants you to be satisfied and comfortable with your duration living in the home!!

<review>Applying for a home has never been so easy.  I applied for a home with Tricon Homes and within 3 days I received my approval status. WOW!  I was contacted by the Portfolio Manager a FABULOUS person name Wendy Fabel.  She has made my process as smooth as can possibly be.  At one point I felt like I was calling her too much, and she assured me that my calls are always welcome.  I felt like she had became my friend. :) I am now enjoying my new home and its all thanks to her.  Thank you Tricon Homes and your fabulous employee Wendy.<//review>< user_name>

When my husband and I first started looking for a house to rent it became a grueling process fast. We were eventually lead to Tricon American Homes and are so grateful for this. The first contact we made was with Brandi Campbell and everything became so easy from here. She was so delightful and informative and lead us to the perfect house. The application process was a breeze and Lisa Junek helped us the rest of the way with getting everything set up and finalized. She was more than helpful and accommodating and made what can often be a painful process, pleasant! Thank you so much!</Review>

Horrible is an understatement. I never  write reviews for anything but I am so upset and disappointed in this company. I would never recommend them to anyone and I will never rent from them again. Zero customer service, accountability or professionalism. Thank god we have to cut the lease because of military orders.<//text>

< review>
We have had a horrible experience with Tricon. Everything in our house it’s breaking down. Had to get a new fridge and lost over 500 dollars worth of deer meat that we were never reemberised for, our dishwasher is still not working after they came out and “fixed” it. They back door doesn’t lock properly and we have had someone try to break in if they would have gone around back i could be dead cause they could have come right in. Our kitchen floor is have water come up from the tile likes puddles.. they have been out four times and it only happens when it rains so they just say it looks fine. The whole how it’s so cheap looking and the patch work in some places it’s horrible. They had to get into the attic to fix a roof leak.. well we don’t even have a attic access so they just cut a hole in the garage and used out gym equipment because the didn’t bring a ladder. They just left all the dust from the cutting. We have been trying to get ahold of someone high but we are always left on hold for hours and some guy gave us his personal number and we try to call and it goes to voicemail. So unprofessional and i can not wait to get out of this damn house. Worst experience ever. Do not use Tricon American homes to rent EVER!!! I am paying good money for this house and it’s complete not functional and I’m livid!!!<//review>

< Review>
My mother has been with Tricon Homes for 3 years now. While our experience has not always been great when it comes to maintenance work, I want to say that Glenn coming on board has been the best decision the company has made. He listened to what my mothers struggles were and how we have been treated and the lack of craftsmanship in our house. He found her a tech that was AMAZING. Then found extra help for us with the extra problems she was having. The new techs in the San Antonio area are amazing and it makes me encourage my mom to sign another lease for a few more years as we are finally getting treated like we should. Great job Glenn, no matter the previous negative the NEW Tricon is great!!!! Keep it up!< /Review>

TJ and Kevin were very proffesional and prompt during the move in process of my rental. They took care of all my concerns and made the move in one of the best I have ever experienced! I would recommoend Tricon to anyone that is looking to do a rental home. Even the staff up to move in were great.< /Text>

<Review>Tricon is one of the best Managment companies to rent from. Quick Maintanace (within a day or two), awesome renter service and they are so great to work with. After a hurricane blew through our AC went out and they came right out and fixed it. Would use them again if we could, supper nice people, willing to work with you.<//Review>< response>

< review>
I have updated my review after an email from Heather stating that some of my complaints were issues with Silver Bay Property Management, and took place before Tricon American Homes took over our lease.
Dealing with this company can be extremely frustrating.
When I called for maintenance because there was a bee hive inside our walls, I was told to spray it with a hose. Idiotic advice for sure. I had to push the issue, and kept stating over multiple phone calls the bees were INSIDE the wall. They finally sent out a technician to check, and he confirmed to them there were in fact bees inside our wall. He told them to send a professional. It should not take multiple phone calls, and two appointments to get something taken care of. I felt like they did not believe me when I made the request.
Dealing with the billing front office has been the most stressful experience. They have made our move out immensely trying. Alicia has caused the greatest amount of our frustration - and panic attacks. She was arguing with me about our move out date. It had already been set via email with Shelly. But, once again, I was not believed. Alicia interrupted me constantly, contradicted herself, and was just plain rude. I originally gave this company a 1-star review because of Alicia, but that is not fair to the people that are asctually really nice. Heather has been an immense help with getting everything taken care of. And, Juan (the technician helping with our move out inspection) has been so kind. They deserve 5-stars. So, that averages out to a 3-stars.< /review>

I have been given the run - around all week with the maintenance department.  All I need is a simple shower knob repair, and after sitting here all day waiting on someone to come to my home to repair the issue, I was told that the worker wasn't dispatched and they would have to schedule another appointment.  FOR WHAT!!!  THE FIRST PERSON WASN'T DISPATCHED RIGHT, SO HOW DO I KNOW THE NEXT APPOINTMENT WILL BE HONORED?!?!

I placed an online maintenance request on Saturday, July 15, 2017 requesting an appointment for Monday, July 17, 2017.  Supposedly, my request was never received, so I had to complete the request by phone.  I was promised that someone would call me with the appointment date and time, but I never heard from anyone.  I called again on Tuesday and was told the same thing.  I made another online request on Wednesday, July 19, 2017 and followed up with another phone call on Thursday, July 20, 2017.  I was told that a technician will be here today, July 21, 2017 between 8 and 11 AM.  By 11 AM, I had not heard from anyone, so I called the office...YET AGAIN...I was then told that the technician was not dispatched and that their earlier appointment would be....(I did not even listed to the available appointment because at this point, I am livid).

As I sat here to type this review, I hear a knock on the door.  Whose outside my door at 11:30 AM?  TRICON!!!  The technician said he was dispatched at 11 AM, which was about the time I was making the call to the company to determine when someone was coming, only to be LIED TO that the technician had not been dispatched.  I have never, in the three years of living in my home, had problems with the property management, maintenance, etc. until Tricon purchased my home.  I am so upset right now that I have tears in my eyes.  The maintenance department do not value people time or need.  I am a VERY unhappy tenant right now.

I pay my rent on time (before the due date) each month, and all I want is to make sure I get the service I deserve and need, the same service Tricon expect and deserve.  At the end of my lease, or whenever i decide that I am going to vacate the premises, I DO NOT WANT or NEED any discrepancies in the move - out inspection.  The manner in which I received the home is the manner in which I expect to return the home to the owner or property manager.  I don't know how anyone can bounce back from such poor customer service.

Amber, the maintenance coordinator, returned my call to offer another appointment, and I appreciate that, but the damage has been done.  I pray that I do not need any further maintenance needs before my lease ends because I feel like I will receive the same type of service as I have received this week, and this is absolutely unacceptable.< /Text>

<Text>me and my family moved into a 3/2.5 house not to long ago, asking rent was fair. when we filled out our application it was easy and we got approved the very next day. when the day came to move in we met the maint guy Luke. we did a very through inspection of the house and pointed out any discrepancies that we found. that same day maybe 8 hours later all issues had been corrected.
I feel very happy with the service that we have been given so far. I look forward to our future renting with Tricon and highly recommend and encourage other to rent from them as well.< /Text></record>

I found a property and Tricon was very transparent with their process. However, after paying a $250 holding fee on the home, they said it was taken. They offered me a refund or to transfer to another home bc the system was not supposed to take my money since it was already rented. I opted for a refund and a few days later they told me it was a system error and I was approved for the home and can move in two weeks. The home is completely renovated and very affordable, in a safe neighborhood. I would have given 5 stars but unfortunately when they told me I wasn’t approved I put in an application with another apartment complex and my $300 deposit was non-refundable. That is not chump change and the rep at Tricon said they couldn’t do anything to accommodate me for my loss. I am going to move into the Tricon home bc it is the best fit for my family. I worked with Laetitia, the leasing agent at Tricon in Huntersville and she was more than accommodating and apologetic for the mishap. She has followed up and been extremely helpful in making me feel more comfortable with making my choice to moving into a Tricon Home. So I would give her 5 stars for her customer service.</Review>

This review is for Patrick Benton and Candice Byndloss of the Atlanta, GA area offices. I have been renting from Tricon for a year and a half, and I cannot lie that the beginning was very difficult. We had multiple issues with maintenance requests not being fulfilled, no return calls & all. We were very ready to leave at the end of our lease as our experience had not been very great. Now, let me just say this. Patrick and Candice legitimately changed our whole entire view of this company. I had never had so much help, communication, follow up and kindness until they came along. I am extremely grateful for both of their help and making us feel more comfortable than ever with leasing with this company. If it had not been for the both of them, we actually would've left. Thank you again Patrick Benton and Candice Byndloss for being stellar people. It is greatly appreciated and thanks again for all your continuous help!<//text>

I have been very satisfied with this company thus far. Wendy answers all my questions everytime I call and she has made my move easy and as stress free as she can. I am a new resident of an amazing home that I love and I can not be more happy to have wendy as a property manager.< /review>

If you lease here - move out as soon as your lease is up. If you are thinking about leasing here DO NOT. If you see a Tricon American homes listing, close the page immediately! If you are thinking about emailing the help desk DON'T! Should you call them?  NO! ( I was on hold for half an hour so it must have been lot of people calling to complain). Spend your time looking for your new home. This company used to be good but the staff changes too much. Everytime I turned around the last worker I dealt with was no longer their anymore. This was a regular thing. The people make up the rules as they go. I kind of feel sorry for the owners because this company is ran so poorly, but then again I wonder if they are the ones calling the shots? Mismanaged and failed venture comes to mind. I do not recommend them.<//Review>

Any difficulties/hiccups that came about she handled with ease and professionalism.  So far my experience with the company and Candace have been great.< /review></record></dataset><record>

This is the worse company ever. I was a Loyal customer for 1 year never late on rent. I put in work orders that where never fully complete, got the run around for a year with work never being complete. I told company months ahead of time the I was leaving when lease was up. They paid it no mind are are charging me 15 extra days rent past my contract. When you need work done in your rental good luck. If you can find another company to deal with do yourself a favor by not dealing with these clowns< /Review>

I have been in my home for 3 years now and decided to renew my lease for another 2 years.  My renewal specialist Jennifer Hausman has been great!  She has taken care of all my requests and answered all questions.  Thank you so much for quick responses and making sure my family was taken care of.< /Review>

She immediately addressed all our issues and someone out the next day resolve them. These two should be commended for the hard work they do! I will definitely recommend Tricon to anyone who is the market to lease a home.

Rented a home for 4 years and never had an issue with ANY request that I submitted. The incentives (1st month free OR half off) are what INITIALLY interested me. Was a little leery after reading a few of the negative reviews, but I guess some tenants aren't created equally 😂😂😂.
In a market like Atlanta, I was allowed to pay rent BELOW market value... which alluded to me saving money and purchasing my own home sooner than my initial 5 year plan. Thanks for the experience, I would DEFINITELY recommend! Oh yeah, George (Atlanta area) the maintenance man is one of the coolest, most knowledgeable, and professional people you will ever meet! 💯< /review>

What a great company truly focused on resident satisfaction. After we moved in everything was great. Clean house everything worked as you would expect. I wanted to change a couple of things in the home. I got in touch with our superintendent Jennifer Henderson and she stopped by that afternoon. She was extremly knowledgable and explained why the company uses certain hardware and how it benefits the residents. Thank you Jennifer and your company for making us feel part of your family</Review>

Ms. Ruby Baker and Ms. Wendy Fabel have been absolutely wonderful to me with concerns of my rental home.  I was in the process of getting my September rent together when some unforeseen personal issues arose and then Hurricane Irma had her way.  When speaking with Ms. Wendy about the lateness of my rent she was very understanding and polite.  After pulling my funds together, I went to the office to pay my rent and was greeted by Ms. Ruby in the most professional and courteous manner.  She was so helpful to me.  They both have made me feel very at ease during this trying time in my life.   These ladies are absolute gems.  Thank you Ms. Ruby and Ms. Wendy for your great customer service, which is definitely a dying art in this day and age.<//review>

Brian Holzwarth and his team here in South Florida have been incredible to deal with every step of the way. Everything was upfront, clear and hassle free. Moving can be so stressful, but he went the extra mile to make everything as smooth as could be!  Thanks, Brian H!</review>

We are getting ready to sign our third lease with this company. We are very happy with our home, management, and maintenance. Maintenance and repairs are always quality work. Tricon is always quick to respond to any questions or concerns. It has been a pleasure to work with Jennifer Hausman and Lennett Moore with the Texas office. I would (and have)recommended this management company to family and friends.<//text>

****UPDATE**** This company has some great people working for them that really want to help its customers.  There is a major lack of communication between departments.  We had major electrical issues in our house.  Our stove was shocking us and when reported we were left with the stove in the house and inoperable.  This was before thanksgiving and when i asked how we were supposed to prepare thanksgiving or even meals i was told to buy a hotplate....  needless to say we are no longer renting from them.  I will say once the issues were brought up to the lead property manager we were allowed to move out with no penalties due to the mishandling of our maintenance and safety issues.

A breath of fresh for a renter who has had bad experiences with rental agencies in the past.  They have taken great care of my family!<//Review>

From my approval up to my move in process, my experience with Tricon in the ATL area has been a breeze thus far. Latoshia was my go to person for any questions while preparing for my move. She was very polite, professional, and communicated efficiently. I look forward to a positive stay with Tricon starting this Friday!</Text>

I am a tenant renting through Tricon and I have never experienced such neglectful customer service as I have with Tricon. We are trying to renew our lease and I have invested HOURS on hold, leaving voicemails, sending emails, calling ANY number I can find. This has been going on for WEEKS! I left a call back number EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. And still no return calls. I have no clue why a business is so interested in losing tenants who pay their rent. DO NOT RENT FROM TRICON!!!!! You will never get any help with anything.</Text>

Our previous company was bought out by this and company and we've had nothing but problems. The most major problem is time to renew the lease and they charged us the new rate BEFORE the standing lease was complete. We tried calling but we keep getting placed on extensive holds (30 mins+). HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU CHARGE SOMEONE A NEW RATE BEFORE THE CURRENT LEASE RATE IS OVER?? This company has something going on and it shouldn't be your money...<//Review><user_name>Shawn Johnson Jr< /user_name></record>

<Text>I have been a resident with Tricon for 3 years as of this April. The reason I am giving them 3 stars is due to my last interaction with Jennifer Hauseman and Gary Pina, because finally after the roller coaster of things not getting completed and many dropped balls, miscommunication, or no communication and follow up at all, as well as not repairing things to adequate living standard; finally things were resolved!! I hope that Tricon will honor and value these two employees and keep more like them ! They were courteous, professional, and did things in a timely fashion. I give these 2 individuals 5 stars and they are the ONLY reason I give the company 3 stars, because we have been very disappointed with the customer service over the time we have been with them.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Anytime I called she answered and responded back quickly. Sherry was attentive, informative, and very professional. I would highly recommend  Tricon American Homes.

<review>A pipe got damaged in my home by a contractor  during a pest control visit in Columbia, SC and my water will be off for a few days. Margaret has been extremely helpful and graceful with the process of getting the contractor to put me into a nice, clean hotel close to my job. I have always been pleased with the sense of urgency this company has towards issues with my home. Just wanted to say thanks and she deserves a pat on the back or lunch or something! Thanks!

What happened to Silver Bay? They were amazing! Tricon?...rude, attitude having representatives that do nothing but make excuses about maintenance requests. Resident for 2 1/2 years under Silver Bay. Will not be renewing at all. Adi and Jeanette; wow just wow. "Don't get mad at me, I didn't do it" was an excuse I got.</text>

We rented a home in lithonia, GA. When our lease was up, we did month to month were we were charged an excessive amount of fees just to do month to month. On top of that, when we vacated the home, they not only took our entire deposit, they added an additional $2,000 for new carpet, blinds and a garage door that never worked when we moved in. We replaced all of the blinds in the home, cleaned the floors, the bathrooms, and nothing was left in the home. This is the WORST company to deal with, stay FAR AWAY! If I could give negative 500 stars, I would.<//review>

<Text>Application got denied without even the option of a higher deposit for a two person application despite having all their required history and exceeding income requirements. Tricon could not tell me the reason why and just refers me to the screening company which just tells me to call Tricon as all they do is provide a report. Asked Tricon if they can at least match us with a home for which we qualify and was told that if you are denied for one then you are denied for all of them (doesn’t make sense). The whole process feels very impersonal. I feel like I am owed at least a reason after the $90 that just went down the drain. Apply with caution.</Text>< Pictures>

He was outstanding with his service called 10 mins prior to arrival and was prompt at 8am! I appreciated him listening to my concerns and giving his assurance/advice being that I'm a first time home renter! John got right to work and let me look at exactly what he had done which was phenomenal work. Great, down to earth guy that easily kept a conversation going from general maintenance tips to small talk about where we were from. This guy deserves the upmost praise and recognition for Grade A customer service! Makes me glad I chose Tricon for our next home!

<time>1533696220568<//time><Rate>4</Rate><Review>I have only recently moved into a property managed by Tricon American Homes and the entire process has been a wonderful, seamless experience. The staff has been very responsive and professional; and were attentive to my requests to help ease my transition from TN to TX. Two members of the team, Alan Todd and Alainna Oka, were especially helpful with my move-in and made sure I moved in successfully and understood the ins and outs of the property. Mr. Todd has also checked in to make sure everything was going well and reiterated contact information for persons to assist in resolving any issue should they arise.

I can't say enough about the team I have worked with (from application to move-in) and would like to thank each of them for making this move for my family one less stressful component of our move.

Update: Almost one year later and time to renew our lease. I really hope we don't regret it though. I'm only going to go down one star because we have enjoyed our experience here and past maintenance requests have previously been attended to fairly quick. Now we have a request for AC issues and in this heat it can get up between 85-90° inside the home. We are going on 2 weeks now and still nothing and this is the second time within 3 months of having the same issue. But overall, there are no other complaints.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1505748630865, 'text': 'Ms. King, thank you for taking the time to tell us about your leasing experience.

<Review>I can’t give a 5 simply because they didn’t earn it. Our home, was not cleaned well and wreaked of pot. I was told it was “ treated” but whatever was done didn’t work. Several days of open windows, 3 bottles of fabreeze, 2 containers of Lysol wipes and several Scentsies with peppermint and rosemary later, it’s finally smelling pretty good. The kitchen grout, under the cabinets is filthy and had to be hand scrubbed. Some poor quality workmanship on some pre move in work as well. I expected better for what I paid for as a deposit, I’d be embarrassed if I leave it, the way I found it.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><user_id>113114343621315804467< /user_id></record>

<Review>I just wanted to take a moment to let you know what an incredible job the tree service sent by Environmental Lawn Maintenance did.  I think the service actually performing the work was Crawford Landscaping.  The crew was extremely professional, efficient and did a beyond excellent job removing the downed tree branch from my back yard.  They took down a dangerously overhanging branch so it’s no longer in danger of piercing the roof; they took care of some dead and low hanging branches off the Dogwood tree in front so it doesn’t die; they cleaned up after themselves and left the property in far better condition than when they arrived.  I would recommend Crawford Landscaping to anyone needing work done.

Thanks for approving service to the property.  I care for this home like a homeowner – not a renter – so I was grateful to receive such quality work.</Review>< Pics>

The amount of time you have to stay on the phone waiting for someone to speak with you is ridiculous.  When we started looking, there were only (2) 4 bedroom houses, neither of which had pictures because they were currently being rented.  Each house had an estimated date available to view, but I was advised to go ahead and apply for one of the houses because they go fast, so that's exactly what I did.  I was approved for the house on a Wednesday and was told I had to have my money in CA within 48 hours.  I called into the company because I still have not been able to see the home.  If the money wasn't sent to the company within 48 hours then my application would be cancelled.  I tried for several days after I was approved and they kept saying "It will be ready tomorrow".  The people I did manage to speak with were rude and should be taught business etiquette.  Please, please, please if you would like to keep your sanity then do not conduct business with this company.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>UPDATE TO MY REVIEW

My initial problem was that even though I had sent my security deposit to Tricon about 6 weeks before my move-in date, I didn't receive my lease agreement until about 5 days before moving in. This was because there was a bit of work being done on the house and they couldn't send the lease agreement until the work was done. I got a call from the regional director not long afterwards and everything was made right. The move-in appointment went very smoothly and we love the new place and are very happy with it.

******************************************

ORIGINAL POST

I'm jealous of all of these 5-star reviews and stories of really responsive representatives. We're trying to move in to one of Tricon's homes. I sent my security deposit in over a month ago (which they demanded 48 hours after my application was accepted. I obliged and sent it FedEx and got it to them the next day). I am now a week away from moving in and I still don't have a lease agreement. Every time I try to get a hold of the lease agent, I need to call multiple times and send an e-mail. She can't give me a straight answer on when I'll have the lease agreement. It's unclear what's holding the process up. It seems like the place will be great, but I've never had this much trouble getting a lease agreement.</Review><UserId.>103607652116972487499< /UserId.>< Pictures>

I honestly feel like this company might be a complete SCAM. There was an empty home for rent in Columbus Ohio that I was desperate to see, I called their main office 3 times and each time it seemed legit, but they told me the local leasing agent would reach out within 24 hours. It's been SIX DAYS and NOTHING. Absolutely NOTHING. I'm taking that and saying if they don't even want my money for an empty house, they why in the world would they ever care about a maintenance request?<//Review>

Edited.

We have since had the maintenance supervisor for our area get the contractor to get out and get the issue fixed. They have taken steps to fix the confusion that seems to happen when there is an issue with a swimming pool.

Original: We have called multiple times for multiple issues (concerning our swimming pool) and we get the run around. They will schedule people to come out and then no one shows up. We had no one show up and then they called to see how our maintenance went and if we were happy. IT WAS NEVER DONE! This happened several times. Our latest issue we have been waiting 6 weeks to get fixed and even with us calling every day we still can't get the same answer from these people about what is going on one day to the next. They tell you someone will call you back, NO ONE will call back. A supervisor got involved. That accomplished nothing.

We have had maintenance issues within our home and have had no problems getting people to come out to fix those. Our experience in renting our home went smoothly. It just seemed to be pool related.

I am happy to see that they are trying to correct the process on their end and that maintenance supervisor has been very responsive and quick to ensure that the issues were fixed on my end.<//Review>

< Review>
Tricon has TERRIBLE customer service. Just moved in 3 months ago and it's been non-stop maintenance requests every month. The maintenance vendors that they contract do half work. So the problem never is fully resolved and you end up having issues again within the same month. The communication is horrible. The maintenance supervisor Shadee Is impossible to reach. The foreperson Josh never answers his phone so I'm not even sure if he's a real person. And the portfolios manager Janet Cho is useless. Issues never get resolved, they just get postponed. THE DAY THAT WE MOVED IN the A/C and heater wasn't working and it was freezing temperatures outside. It took them 5 days to "fix" it just for it to break down again. The A/C has stopped working for the 6th time in 3 months and I frankly don't know what I'm paying rent for. They mask their properties to look nice on the surface, but once you actually live there that's when you start finding plumbing, electrical, pest infestation, etc. Issues everywhere. Not worth the money or your frustrations. Rent somewhere where the landlords actually care about their tenants liveability. Renting with Tricon has been the biggest mistake I've made in 2019 and I will be sure to leave reviews everywhere so that other renters do not fall for the same trap that I did. Lesson learned!</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>When you are looking for a home, they are prompt, but once you become a resident, they are slow to respond, or they don’t respond at all. My A/c went out, right before Labor Day. Mind you, it’s 90+ degrees in Atlanta, during the summer. I called several times, and the request were “put” in, but they didn’t call to fix it, until 5 days later. They say things were slow because of the holidays, but if I click the prompt for potential residency, I got someone on the phone very quickly. I even Emailed the local office, they never responded.

Now I recieved an extra 50 on my rent, because they claim, I didnt Have renters insurance. When I recieving those emails, I called the office. I was told that it was just a general email, that goes to every resident. I have had renters insurance, since moving in. I am disappointed because I love my home, but the professionalism of this company, will force me to move.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>I moved in 9 weeks ago, I called Tricon to fix my heat called Tricon maintenance immediately as we were freezing and was assured it would be placed as an emergency and be fixed right away..I heard nothing and called then 4 days later..They said they got their signals mixed &  would send someone to fix it.
Approximately a week later, a repairman came and stated the air conditioner was wired to the heater and he repaired it.  Immediately, we realized it was not fixed and heat wasn't coming out of vents in the upstairs.  I called back in and  after another two weeks of me calling in, Tricon sent someone else out who stated the vents had return grates on them rather than heat grates so NO HEAT can come out.  He stated that he would get Tricon approval & order the correct ones and return to fix..that was 5 weeks ago, So after moving in 9 weeks ago, I have made 51 phone calls..I have spoken to JANET, LATOISHA , BRANDON, CHRISTIAN AND several others from residential and maintenance  departments trying to get this fixed to NO AVAIL... I called again today to be told the same thing.
that they were told there's furniture in front of wents??  really Tricon??           Apparently, I need not pay rent this month and maybe Tricon will listen and ACTUALLY SEND SOMEONE HERE TO REPAIR MY HEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9 WEEKS..MY CHILDREN CANNOT SLEEP UPSTAURS BECAUSE IT IS TOO COLD!!!!!!!!!!
Did you read the notes? did you take notes when I called? Do you guys follow up ever? Do you listen to your customers when they call?  Two technicians and in excess of 51 calls later..I'm spending my time EVERY day calling Tricon so that my children can sleep in their bedrooms and not freeze, I'm disabled and I am having to fight for you guys to fix the vents and the bathtub!  I will reach out to the housing department to assist the disabled in cases such as mine as Tricon doesn't care and while I appreciate your time LaTasha, there aren't enough emergency meetings, phone calls & conferences that you & the entire tricon team states they are on or in to excuse yourselves from doing what is right..

This review is for the Indianapolis area and Dana Keyes!  I have been nothing but pleased with our last 2 years at our residence.  Our yearly rent increase has been minimal and expected.  There are others in our neighborhood that have had horrible rental experiences and pay top dollar.  I can't say enough how lucky we are to have made the move to Tricon when me came to Indiana.  We are buying this year, but will continue to tell everyone with how pleased we are.  Thanks Dana and Tricon Indianapolis!!!!</Text>

<name>Sharette Driver<//name><Time>1500470493817<//Time><Rating>1< /Rating><review>This rating is based on the fact that it took over a month for Tricon to replace the AC unit in our home. Our unit stopped working on May 29, 2017 and after several phone calls to customer service, missed appointments or no shows by the HVAC tech, they finally replaced our old unit with a new one on July 5, 2017. I live in a home with small children, one who has Asthma & another just under a year old so the time that it took to get this Maintenance Emergency fixed during the peak of Summer was unacceptable. In fairness, they did respond quicker to other maintenance issues that we had such as the pest problem that occurred as the result of us having to leave our windows open in the house to keep cool, and they replaced our refrigerator when it went out in 1 day.</review>< pics>

I wish zero stars it was available to write but NEVER DO BUSINESS With This Joke of a company!!! I am in Columbia South Carolina and  I highly regret the lease I signed with them 2 weeks ago! Today is 15 days with no heat or air!!! I have called and complained every day with zero communication from our local property manager! Only contact I manage to have is with the answering service in California And they obviously could care less. This is ridiculous! After being here for 5 days I came home to 3 guys in my home who had been sent over to replace a window and entered my home by taking the window out! This should never be allowed  to happen! I was informed during the walkthrough inspection that I would receive a call to schedule replacement of a front window but never received any prior notifications and to top it all off they replaced the Wrong window!  I was offered $100 credit toward my rent but I have yet to receive anything and instead I have a $97 late fee on my account which is impossible considering that I had to pay the deposit and the first months rent to move in and it is only been two weeks. I have asked several times for this to be corrected and yet no one seems to care. We have had numerous issues since we have been here with the plumbing and the fireplace but they have corrected  these issues. The heating And air guy came one night and rigged the breaker up  and was unsure of himself. I can see why because the next day it quit working again and he has yet to show back up. Also I showed him in the attic where the ductwork was coming loose from the handler and he assured me he fixed it yet after he left I went back up there and it appears he did not touch it at all.After taking several days off of work to take care of these issues and also days where the air conditioning guy has not shown up or called I have had to miss time off of work and I am losing money and yet still have all of these problems! How can you rent someone a home without doing a thorough inspection and making sure that the simple things work? But more importantly how can you leave your tenant without heat and air for over 15 days?
I guess my next step is to contact my lawyer and try to get out of my lease because it appears tricon American homes could care less about their tenants and there are zero communications with the people that they have on hand locally! Please do yourself a favor and stay far far away from this company!<//Text>

This is my first year with Tricon American Homes. I had an annoying issue with the cleanliness of carpet that was due to a Husky dog that lived in the home prior to my move in. I tried hiring a carpet cleaning company to remove the smell twice, yet and still the dog smell persistently came back. It was a horrid smell that wouldn’t go away. I reached out to maintenance requesting that they’d look into it. In the end, they sent someone to my home to extract the smells so that I could be comfortable in my home. I haven’t smelled ANYTHING since. I am grateful that the maintenance manager in Charlotte went out of his way to make his resident happy. They truly care about their clients, and recommend this company to anyone interested in renting a home.<//text>

Tricon American Home’s is by far the worst. They have charged us for renters insurance saying that we dint have coverage. When we have insurance through USAA and have the confirmation email from tricin stating that we do have our own coverage.</Text>

< review>
Just like everyone here i gave them 360 for the application and pre deposit fee. They approved me and said the house would be ready. They made me get rentals insurance, water utitities, and light utitities. They said our viewing would be almost a month after they had me approved and the house never was ready. It was in "turn over" status. The property mamager never reached out to me. I emailed and call everyone involved and had no success with the house status. I trusted this company with making sure i had a house to live by the stated date and they did not. I'm stuck now looking for another house to rent with all this new utilities accounts. They said they will return my deposit and void my lease. I'm still waiting for my refund. If i dont get my refund i will make a claim to the BBB. This was in the ATL area.</review>

<Text>My leasing manager Brian Holzwarth was very professional and courteous while we were trying to get somewhere to move in. Brian followed through with the rental property we liked and got in there really quick.  Brian also definitely followed through with getting our water turned on as we were scared to move in to the home without water.  Very impressed that he remained professional throughout my frustration.

Now we are waiting for Tricon to address the A/C cooling/insulation roofing problem and hope this will be done asap!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1499473125005, 'text': 'Dear Nola Blake Reyes, We are very happy to hear that your leasing to move-in experience has been an enjoyable one.

This was the first and only time a dispute with the neighbors was documented on Ms. Campbell’s account. On April 4, 2018, a vendor completed repairs to the fence.  We would like to thank Ms. Campbell for following standard move-out recommendations and getting the carpet professionally cleaned. Overall the home was returned to us in very good shape however, after further inspection it was recommended by the Maintenance Supervisor that the carpets be replaced to ensure the next residents received a home of the same standards at move-in.

<review>I would not recommend this property management company to anyone because they do not care for their customers. We rented a home, of course had no issues getting moved into the home and everything set up. But, the experience throughout our one year stay was TERRIBLE!! We found out we moved next to terrible neighbors ( the reason the past two tenants moved out). I understand this is not their responsibility, but the fact that i tried to reach out to the company multiple times asking for help on certain situations and would never answer the phone or return my calls. I had two police reports submitted and reached out to a Tricon Rep for them to not show any concern or consideration to help. The neighbors caught our fence on fire and it was a disaster trying to get it fixed. It seems this company is only worried about getting the rent check on time each month, not the experience their clients have living in their homes. Also, when it came down to moving out after a year because we were NOT going to renew, we did not get refunded our full amount. Whenever we did the walk through before moving out, they recommended getting the carpets cleaned by a company and painting a few knicks on the wall. That is  exactly what we did to ensure we got our full money back for a terrible experience. We left the receipt from the cleaning company and patched up the spots, but we did not get our money back for it. I called everyday for a week and no one returned my calls. It is a shame because we really enjoyed the home, but because of the company we couldn't move out fast enough.< /review>< Pictures>

No problems have been serious enough to write a bad review and not everything is gonna be perfect, but every problem we've had she's has been right there to help and advise. It's not always easy to get in contact with people or get answers. That's when I turn to Ms. Brandy.

I really am very disappointed with Tricon American Homes. I have lived here for almost 2 years, with STILL another year  left on my lease.  Never been late.  Never had any issues with my house.  First work order I put in since living here was for my A/C not cooling.  Had 2 different vendors come out so many times during a 2 week period.  A/C completely went out when it was almost 120 degrees outside.  The inside temperature in the house was reading 105 degrees.  I left emails and voicemails and no one has tried to reach out to me.  The lack of communication from the Management/Maintenance team is a reason why I am counting the days until my lease is over and move.</text>

<Review>They stick to the policy that one should have a paycheck in order to rent a house. Moving from Michigan to Florida, we applied for a rental house through Tricon. My husband sold his business and I quit my job just for this move and to start a new venture in Florida . We provided them proof of sufficient funds and have excellent credit history... but they denied our application cos we don't have a paycheck - no other choice given. Inshort,they go by the books and no room for case by case analysis ... makes no sense.
Btw, we got approval for another house through another company who knew what they are doing<//Review>< pictures>

Before we signed the lease I spoke with our leasing agent about a strong mildew/mold smell in the lower level and the windows. She said she'd send someone out before the walkthrough. We didn't get to see the property again before the walkthrough, so when we had arrived--lease already signed, these things had not been attended to. We took tons of pictures and again talked to the walkthrough superintendent who agreed that some of these issues were not small. We had a tech come "fix" the windows. He literally looked at them all and said they needed to be replaced. At $1250 a month I feel like this is not acceptable. I have a 6yr old son with autism who could easily open the windows and escape because they don't lock and he is nonverbal and does escape. We have flies and bugs coming in through those nasty windows. We can't circulate fresh air because the windows have no screens. I combed through the lease before we signed and was confident that this company would be reputable. Just one incident with these windows and my son, and there will be calls to lawyers. We are willing to replace the windows ourselves with a decrease in rent. We just want our home to be safe.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Literally  the best tech I've ever dealt with throughout my years of renting .If you ever have an issue with things inside your home while renting ,ask for Terrence ..You won't regret it :)</review>< username>

Our lease expired on June 30th of 2018. I paid rent through the end of the lease, gave the proper 30 days written notice and they still charged me for an extra months rent, which they took out of my deposit.

This is not proper and they're trying to tell me that I required a 60 day written notice.

My advice, don't rent from crooks! We'll be contacting a lawyer!<//Text>< pics>

Great management company. Was quick to fix any issues we have. Very reasonable move-out requirements. They worked with us when we need an extra mlm month in order to close on our house. Spent a year with them and couldn't be happier. We were sad to leave but happy to finally enter the world of homeownership!<//Review>

This is our first time renting a house with Tricon American Homes. It's been a rough experience starting with the leasing agent showing the house. The house began having maintenance issues. We called the customer care line but nothing was happening. It wasn't until we called our property manager, Alexandra, that things started to get taken care of in the house. Alexandra has been in constant contact with us to make sure the repairs were happening and how our experience was with each contractor they sent to the house. She came out herself when the jobs were taking to long to see what was going on. She is a very tentative manager and cares about us as more than "tenants" and always sees that we are happy and comfortable. She is the best property manager that I have rented from.</text>

My heater broke on a Friday afternoon when its 30 to 40 degrees outside but tricon kept me updated and worked with us. And then Mel Lazo came with some space heaters while we waited for the ac repair guy to come by. It was not something I asked for but that ment a lot to me. So my living room is comfortable while we wait thanks to Mel.<//Text>

< review>
Absolute worst rental company I have ever rented from. We had some serious issues with our rental property and the basement periodically floods. Thankfully, we had a tech come out to suck up the water but they needed a foundation specialist to come in and have been waiting 4 months despite requesting multiple maintenance requests. Basement continues to flood. I have had 5 separate appointments for various other issues and they have failed to show up about 80% of the time with a no call no show. When you call for a request you get a call line and are not able to speak with the same person each time so nothing get relayed. Cannot get ahold of management about reoccurring issues and they fail to return phone calls/voicemails.</review>

If I could give this place no stars I would. I hate lazy companies that make you do applications online. I went to look at a house Monday, tried to start my application on Tuesday, the page it sent me to after said that someone would contact me soon, only no one ever called, and now it’s Friday and the house is gone. So now not only have they wasted my time, but I lost out on a house due to incompetence. If the house is not available don’t allow showings. It’s that simple.<//Text>

<text>After two and a half months of looking and applying for a rental in Reno, NV (this market is quite daunting), I came across a Tricon American Home and the leasing agent Shanna Casey. Not only was she early meeting me, but she had the front door open and inviting. The home didn't work for what I needed and I just took it as yet another disappointment and went back to Trulia. I received an email from Shanna about how glad she was to meet me and my daughter (she even remembered her name!) and that she looked forward to helping me with my house hunting experience (what??? help?!? I NEED HELP) She knew exactly what my children and I needed and contacted me on the first day a home in my area came up. Throughout the entire application experience, she was totally helpful and even answered my late night text questions! She guided me through the steps in order to ensure I would get the home. She went above and beyond anything I could have imagined! Once I was approved for the home, she met me there for the walk-through with three gift bags for my little children to keep them busy! SO SWEET! She was just so patient and kind from beginning to end! I even opened up the fridge to a homemade banana bread and card welcoming us to our new home! It doesn't get much better than that! In the midst of the chaos of moving, I was so lucky and am still thankful to have come across someone who actually gave a care that I found a home for my and my kiddos. As a single mother, I will forever be thankful for Shanna taking the stress off of looking, applying with 50 other people, getting beat out and repeating for two months! SHANNA WAS A GODSEND! So far, my experience with Tricon has been phenomenal! I scheduled a maintenance request which was so simple and easy online and even received a follow up call. I am beyond pleased with my entire experience! Now excuse me while I go light a fire in my new home and start hanging my pictures... <3< /text><gmap_id>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133< /gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< date>

I’ve been trying to contact and agent for 2 days now and no one is responding to my calls, emails, or to my message on their Facebook page! This isn’t the first time I’ve had this issue. I call and sit on hold for longer than i should have to and am even hung up on at times. This customer service is ridiculous. I tried to send an email to whom i thought was my leasing agent only to get a message back saying that my message was rejected, but no alternative contact information was given. I am beyond frustrated with this business as a whole. I’ve asked time & time again for a direct phone number or the address to an office nearby because i can’t seem to find the info online and every time i ask they act as if I’m asking for some FBI top secret stuff & suggest “just leaving a message at the office for them to contact you when they get in”. I’ve never dealt with something like this. If i had been late on a payment or something of that nature I’m sure they’d be doing all they could to reach out to me.</review>

As an outgoing tenant, I cannot speak highly enough of my Tricon experience.  Dana Keyes was instrumental in helping me to find a place of safety.  She knew precisely what I was going through without me having to say a word; her intuition was beyond anything I have ever seen and her passion for helping others is a true gift. Dana and Jessica Rediske are a team of people who put the needs of others above their own-something all too often forgotten.

Of course, there were a few issues here and there with a downed tree or a broken mailbox hinge, but these types of events are what I call "life".  The team at Tricon always took care of any issue immediately and with great care and a very high level of professionalism.

I truly appreciate the team at Tricon making my time with them very enjoyable.  It was a very fresh breath of air.  I only hope other tenants are able to work with Dana and her team.< /Text>

I've been renting with Tricon for 4 years now.  Service has never been very great for maintenance or calling for assistance with anything.  I've been calling them almost daily for the last month and always wait on hold for someone for 10 minutes, then leave a callback request with my number.  I've only received a call back once, where it rang 3-4 times and they hung up before I was able to answer it and they didn't even leave a voicemail.<//text>

We moved from Florida to Mesquite and we're specifically looking for a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom house. When we pulled in we quickly learned the listing was wrong; it was a 3 bedroom not 4. The house was not turn ready meaning it was not finished regarding fixing maintenance issues from previous owner or just the basic cleaning. It took 2-3 months of emailing the Superintendent here in Dallas to get what should have been done prior to us moving in to being resolved. We have gotten 2 non-complaint letters from the City of Mesquite since living here on things that Tricon should be knowledgeable about and it takes them FOREVER to respond and show up. I have put in work orders that I have to follow up on 3 or more times before I ever get any assistance. I sure don't have time to babysit a corporate company regarding the services they should be providing a paying tenant. The vendors they use are awful. They schedule appointments and then never show up or call. My suggestion, don't schedule off work for these people. And when you want to talk with someone higher in the Corporate chain you can't find a phone number other than the main line you call on a regular basis for things. You pretty much are stuck talking to the same people over and over. The only reason we are still here in this home is because we don't want to move again until it is into our new home we buy. Fingers crossed and a lot of prayers that will be soon. We will never rent from Tricon again if it is an option!< /Review><UserId.>103628068084111586381< /UserId.><gmap_id>0x80dcdeebf76d28e7:0xd40e54b6d26af133< /gmap_id></record>

I had the absolute pleasure of dealing with Alexandra Thompson, who I believe is a portfolio manager.  The level of her professionalism and attentiveness was only outweighed by her GENUINE desire to help myself and my nine month pregnant wife in renewing our lease.  We had earlier encountered some technical difficulties in the process but Ms. Thompson went completely above and beyond the call of duty in resolving the situation.  She took time out of her personal schedule (which I could tell by the date and hour of the e-mails) to rectify our somewhat complicated situation.  I went from somewhat skeptical, to devout and overjoyed with Tricon.  Keep up the amazing work and customer service.< /Text>

This is a terrible company and I suggest you stay away.  They have bad customer service and are non- responsive. I called them several times, sent emails, and it took about a month for them to contact me.  Also, when you move out be expected to pay.  My husband and I cleaned up the home, painted and everything and were still hit with charges. We paid on time and took care of the property but that's not enough.  It really is a shame how this company treats its tenants. I’m so glad we bought a home and moved out.

In response to the message below from the owner.
I was expecting to pay for early release for moving out prior to the end of the leasing  agreement. However, the windows and blinds were broken when we moved in and placed on the checklist. Also $70 for two small cheap blinds is excessive. The carpet was normal wear and tear. Most companies clean the carpets after every tenant moves out.

I suggest that all new tenants take pictures when you move in and before you move out.</text>

As we discussed with you on 3/15/17, upon move-out you were assessed for 1) an early lease termination fee 2) repair for the broken blinds and 3) carpet cleaning.   You were not charged for the broken window.  We apologize that the communication regarding these charges was unclear but we hope that the follow up verbal communication with our team helped to clarify the situation.

I called for information on their pet policy today. The lady was polite, pleasant and had the information at the ready, however the 1 star comes from the policy itself. They still charge the pet fee even if it is just a caged animal. So if you have a hamster that cost 10 bucks, prepare to shell out 300 dollars regardless. That is just absurd and most other "pet friendly" companies I have talked to will waive the fee or at least reduce the fee significantly. I was told that I would be charged 500 total for 2 small caged animals. That is why I will not be doing business with them as that is just ridiculous. At least I was given the information promptly so that I'm not wasting my time on their website.

Edit: In reply to the owner below.

I read the form on your website prior to calling. It didn't specify a specific rule on caged animals so I called for clarification. Often times, companies are iffy on exoctic animals. The pets we are talking about are 2 ferrets. They are primarily caged, but some places make a special rule about them. Hence my call.< /Review>

We would very much like to contact you to discuss your concerns, but we cannot find your Google username in our customer database.

Our complete pet policy can be found on our website: https://triconah-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/Terms-of-Agreement-and-Qualifications.pdf.  We do have a pet fee of $300 for the first dog and cat, $200 for any additional dog and cat, and a $35 per month pet rent.  We have reeducated our staff, as the use of “animal” may have been unclear to them, and we want to ensure clear communication with our customers in the future.'}< /response></record>

The Tricon team has been professional and very helpful. Before Tricon took over managing the house that we rent, we could never get a live person on the phone to talk to when we had a problem. Tricon answers the phones, so that's a huge plus.
The times that we've needed repairs, they're scheduled quickly. Recently we had an emergency on a weekend and had to evacuate. The only problems we encountered were with a 3rd party vendor that Tricon was using. Once I was able to contact Tricon the next week, they fixed the problems and also took notes of our problems with the rude staff from the 24 hour maintenance company.
Tricon follows through and resolves problems.< /text>

I've been with Tricon going on 2 years. The original owner of the home was sold to them shortly after I moved in. I've had the best customer service experience ever from a housing management company with Ms. Cindy Smith! I had issues with my HVAC before their company took over and every time I needed service done Cindy was right there to help. AWESOME JOB! She deserves a RAISE, for real! Oh and I was NOT PAID to post this review. This lady went above and beyond to help me get heat in my home for me and my 10 yr old son when it was 17 degrees outside! I truly appreciate her for everything she did.< /Text>

I'm giving 5 stars just based of my experience I have had with my leasing agent latoshia Bates. She has been awsome working with me on getting moved in to the home. I have had to adjust alot of things due to some family medical issues. Eveytime she has been more than willing to accomadate for my family. Also, responds to my calls/emails quickly. So far this has been very easy process & less stressful than I anticipated. I hope living in the home this year. I experience the same customer service & fast respone. Thank you Toshia!!!< /Text>

December 26, 2018. Both the leasing agent Alainna Oka and the Asst. Portfolio Manager Tiffany Salyer were so helpful and kind. Their expertise made our leasing experience with Tricon American Homes the greatest. In just a week we found the property best for us and completed all the paperwork. We had a lot of questions, and every time we called the Tricon American Homes representatives were patient and helpful. Thank you Alainna & Tiffany!</review>

Maintaining steady contact with any of the realtors was a nightmare, however, there is something to be said about the Portfolio Manager Brian Ramsey. If you want something done don't bother going through anyone else but him. He maintained day-to-day contact with us and made sure everything was in order before move-in. Especially when the rest of the team struggled with it. He basically took on the responsibility of all parties that were needed to get us moved in. And on top of that, his customer service abilities were fantastic. I'd give Tricon a 2 star and Brian a 5.<//Review>< user_name>

Very professional and easy to contact when prospecting a home and the whole move in process was nice an easy. Every time we needed help, they were very attentive until towards the end of our lease. I do not know if management changed, but responsive time on simple contact took weeks. It took 3 weeks for me to be able to contact someone to schedule a walk thru and this still was scheduled after the lease was over. Month to month fee was charged even though i moved out 2 weeks before lease was over. California team had to personally stay on the phone with me and  reach out to the team here in Georgia for a response as well as the scheduling of the walk thru. Amazed at this. But finally out, waiting on my month to month fee back, its been 2 weeks, i know company has 30 days after the lease to return deposit along with mischarged fees, so we will see. =)</Text>

<Review>This place is horrible when it comes to customer service and taking care of their tenants. I live in Texas and my air is out and I have been calling since yesterday. Each person I speak with has no empathy whatsoever and to say that they do not care would be an understatement. I am so hurt by the lack of concern for my family in this heat, but they want their rent payment on time or they will quickly send you a notice to vacate. I can't be mad at anyone, but myself. I don't know what me and my children are going to do, because I cannot afford to pay Tricon and live in a hotel until they decide to fix the air. Don't put your family through this people. I won't even mention the many other things that are wrong and hasn't been fixed. God bless us please.</Review><Resp>{'time': 1532372404315, 'text': 'Ms. Wyatt, Thank you for taking the time to express your concern, regarding your AC.

<review>I have lived in the same property for the past 3+ years.During this time the ownership of the property has changed to Tricon AH. Most recently, Tricon has made some significant changes that require action by residents and these changes are only communicated through email.
I have complied with what was required of me as a resident, but Tricon has not always processed my feedback most efficiently and has unfavorable outcome for me as a resident.
As a result, I had to recently work with both Patrick Benton and LaToshia Bates to get these matters resolved. Both were very professional and pleasant to speak with. They both took the time to explained Tricon processes and how it impacts me as a resident.
Patrick immediately return my call, when I didn't answer followed-up with an email explaining exactly what he did to rectify the situation, showed empathy and apologized on the behalf of Tricon.
Each time I called LaToshia she answered and took the time to walk through the process and confirm my documentation was received all during the call.
I'm not happy with how some things are being handled with Tricon, but I appreciate both of Patrick and LaToshia awesome attention to detail and great customer service. Invaluable employees.
Thank you.

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Update as of 03/20/19: They are making a good effort to rectify the issue.

Oh where to start! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU NEVER USE THIS COMPANY. If I could give you negative, I would. People viewing this can see i left positive reviews for other places.
I moved into a Tricon American Home on February 1st 2019. In Dallas Georgia. I have had issues since I moved in. I didn’t have a dishwasher for three weeks. There was rat feces coming from the Attic!
Now let’s get to the icing on the cake. I received a 330 dollar water bill. My husband I have never paid more than 45. We aren’t here for 12 hours a day. We have us and a dog. We were told we used 6, 730 gallons in February. That is wasteful. My friends who have pools use less than that.

Well at least I have done my research, the city reported that this house had a $700 plus water bill when it had no tenant. Zillow states this house was bought 11/7/18. I hope they can explain the high bill and the issues.  The plumber that came today, he was awesome. However it is intresting that a house you bought in November has so many issues.
Oh lets add another fun fact. They messed up on who the utilities were with before I moved in. I had to pay $150 dollar deposit to the city of dallas, to turn on water on January 30th as told to do by representatives at Tricon. Keep in mind my lease start date was 02/01/19. My neighborhood was changing to a private company to read the meter. So when the city of Dallas sent me a refunded check I received 117 dollars. I spoke to All in one the property management company that says they sent mailers to tricon telling them about the water changes. There is no reason they shouldn’t have known.  I got ripped off because no one could tell me how to switch the water to my name. It is not my fault that no one knows how the transition should take place.
Now the new company is charging another 150 dollar deposit that is actually to cover the HOA. Even though in the lease it mentions HOA being covered by tricon. Coverage should include deposits and fees.  I’m sure they will rob me of more money.
Oh and one more thing! I have talked to other tricon members in this subdivision. The water leaking issues is apparently super common. Also Tricon representatives have stated they know nothing about neighborhood HOA’s, so it leaves your clients screwed. However you should be held accountable for the big things they tell you that change.

I’m sure you are going to report this to my region. I’m sure they won’t respond.

Awful awful awful. They make you seem like you have the house and give it away to someone else. Very unprofessional! Don't do business with these people. I've had two different Realtors work with me and just disappear after they promise the house was mine and it wasn't . I hope y'all get shut down. I plan to go to a higher source on your fraud ass company. Pretty funny I was going to buy a 200,000 home but something on a my room mates record that was cleared and in paper stating that they denied us and gave the house away that next few hours.

Because of your company my house is packed and I have no where to live. I gave away all my furniture to get brand new in not one but two different houses promised to me. Now here I sit on my floor having to unpack things to sign another month on my apartments lease until I find something.</Review>

Up until now I have had a great experience with Tricon American Homes. I decided to do a transfer to make the process of moving easier. I picked a place in GA to move to and I was told it was put on hold and a month before I was suppose to move in they said they sold the property. I didn't get upset because I had found a place I liked better on the website and so that one was put on hold for me. 2 weeks before I'm supposed to move in I call and ask if they're going to have any move in specials and the lady I'm working with Janet , says she's sorry but it "slipped through the cracks" They had sold that property too. This makes me very unsure about the professionalism of the company. I never had any problems with rent and I was easily approved for the transfer. It's upsetting to get your hopes up about a property, and have all your things in boxes ready to move just to be told "I'm sorry". I found another property that was 100 above my price range online in the area where my new job is located  and asked if she would be able to lower the price on that one since there were no longer any places available in my price range in that area. I was told no because they would just find someone who could afford that place, but the point was I was suppose to be able to move in to a place in my price range that I actually wanted but you're company made a mistake and you can't offer me any type of discount?? They offer discounts on rent and now they're having a black friday win a free year of rent promotion, but they can't reduce the rent on one property by 100 dollars... No counter offer was made I was given a manager's number but he has yet to call me back. For now I'm stuck making an hour drive to work for who knows how long. I may even be stuck in a packed up house for the holidays.</Review>

Despite having an on-going cockroach infestation, the marietta manager Josh, has been very accommodating, responsive, and extremely quick in getting exterminators out to treat the house.

EDIT: Tricon will cancel your work order without consulting you. Our AC stopped working properly and Tricon canceled the work order without following up at all. This is during the hottest months of the year in the southeast. Our house has reached almost 90 degrees inside some days and the office has been extremely difficult to reach to try and resubmit our maintenance order.
After a negative review tricon was fast in reaching out and fixing our AC system.</text>

< review>
I paid for a $295 REFUNDABLE deposit/hold on a property. I was denied, but the bad news is Tricon literally lost my money that was used to hold the property. They cant pull it up using my name or the receipt number THEY ISSUED ME. It's been 2 weeks, and they still haven't returned my  money. I was told by a "Supervisor" some guy was going to call me back to explain where my money is that they can't find. The world needs to know this before you trust this company to hold money from you on a property that they failed to tell you had already been rented.

👎 I hated to give them a star. I'm In the process of reporting it to the BBB.< /review>

I have a 6 month old child who stays home during the day and we live in south Florida where it is almost 100 degrees outside. My electric bill doubled the last month because it isn’t working properly.

He came on July 11th at am.  He was on time, thorough, introduced himself when he came and was very nice.  He kept us involved every step of the way while he was here fixing our doors and the cracking in the walls and ceiling.  Not only did he fix our doors and advised about the cracks, but he also asked if there were other things he could do to fix.  I was pleasantly surprised by this action.  He showed us how to fix the air vents so the master bedroom could get some cool air.  Jason also showed me why the garage was making a horrifying noise during opening and closing. Jason was awesome.  I hope the next time we have an issue here at the house, I will be sure to ask for him to come.  Jason, your Customer Service as off the charts fantastic!

Could not be happier with my move in experience. When i went to look at the house Bryan was knowledgeable and made sure to answer any of my questions. My application process was great as well, they took the time to make sure I turned in everything possible to get approved for the home I wanted. They got me into the home quickly and was efficient when it came to helping me get things set up! When i got my keys bryan went through everything with me as well as there was a maintenance working onsite that taught me about things around the house.
This company has been nothing but helpful through this whole process and I can't wait to be fully moved in!</Review>

I've been a resident of Tricon since August of 2017. In the beginning they were very diligent when it came to repairs. For the past 2 months I've been trying to get them to fix a hole that formed on the outside of my home. They've sent someone twice to take pictures and one person put some kind of white foam into the hole making it look as if my home has a white growth coming out of it. Still no repair. I submitted an emergency request because my kitchen sink is leaking causing water to pool under the sink but I guess its not an emergency to them. I guess when I move out I can expect a bill for the water damage. I pay way too much rent for them to act like slumlords.(oh btw they raised the rent without warning) I am extremely disappointed in the piss poor service I've been receiving.</Text>

Tricon homes has been a wonderful property management company for us in arizona.  Gina Nelson is a great representative and very helpful with all our needs.  Our home was beautiful, in a great location and very well maintained.  In 3 years we only had 3 maintence issues and each was addressed and fixed within 2 days.  We loved living in Arizona.<//review>

I had the pleasure of working with a David Dozier. From the get go we’ve had a great experience. Within minutes I got a phone call back after requesting a viewing and got to see the house just a few hours later. He’s been going above and beyond for us. Even when we had a hiccup in our application they refunded our original fees and helped us sort out what mistake had happened, then got aprroved within the hour! From the get go we’ve had great customer service.<//Text>

My mother and I moved into a home managed by Tricon last February. Recently, due to some unforeseen financial circumstances, we had to work very closely with Lennett in the accounting office. She was beyond amazing in working with us to make sure everything was ok. I too am in the property management business and hope that my residents feel as comfortable and secure working with me as I did working with Lenette.</Review>

Is there a contact for the Charlotte region that I can reach out to directly ? I'm a current resident with a lease coming to an end and some dire questions I can't seem to get answered. Have tried the various phone numbers, left voicemails, and sent emails - all of which have not yielded a response....Any help would greatly be appreciated as this seems to be the only way people are getting response.< /Text>

<Text>Got a home from Silver Bay, the next we were made aware that Tricon now owns it. We have requested that initial walk through repairs would be made ie, a Garage door that slides down when open and a shower that spews boiling water, last but not least a stove that goes from simmer to boil while still set on simmer.

A maintenance man came out, made notes and found more problems with the home. We have called several times to follow up, and have heard ..... NOTHING. messages have been left and there has been zero response.

I will keep you posted.<//Text>< userid>

Really more of an experience with one of the maintenance engineers, John Encarnacion!!!  This guy was a pro.  He made things work almost by looking at them.  Lol.  In less than ten minutes he got two major appliances (fireplace and dryer) working.  He then took patience to find the right hinges to fix two cabinet doors the right way, so they were flush and self closing without magnets.   I know at this rate he will be a superintendant whenever he's ready.   Add that he was positive, professional, clean, considerate and sociable.  Nice job hiring John, Tricon!!!<//Review>

The first home we chose with Tricon was not ready on the initial date that was said. So we chose another home. Which we LOVE! Michelle Harris helped us tremendously through the process. Very sweet, kind, patient and accommodating with anything needed and answering all questions and addressing all concerns. Now here comes move in date.....We were naturally super excited! David Kubicek the Maintenance  Superintendent helped keep that excitement high! He was amazing at making us feel comfortable on our move in date. I am the type to ask A LOT of questions but he was sooooooo thorough that I barely had to ask one! Lol It's like he memorizes the renters manual. But I love it! He knows his stuff and gave you information on all the expectations the company has of how to keep up the home and makes you feel comfortable to reach out to him and the company with any of your needs. Everyone at Tricon have been so nice! Keep up the great work. Will be recommending Tricon to family and friends.< /review>

I absolutley love Tricon, they work around the clock non stop just to ensure that you have everything you need. My schedule is so hectic and I forgot to place a work order and Mrs. Janet went above and beyond to get it taken care of for me asap. I will admit I am hard to please, but Tricon has by far blown me away with their customer service. I will recommend any one looking for a home to Tricon, belive me, you won't be disappointed!!

<text>I had a great experience with my home through Tricon. My home was very beautiful. When we had a storm and there was damage to the rood, they came immediately to make the repairs to the home. I was very pleased with the service.  When I initially rented they were very helpful in the process. Unortunately a little over 2 months prior to the end of my lease I informed Tricon that I wanted to transfer, I needed to downsize. Once I received the information and moved forward to complete all the steps necessary for the transfer it was as if they had dropped the ball on me. I had even had issues concerning my final walk through. It was not until a few days prior to my move out that a gentleman finally contacted me to let me know that he would not be able to do the walk through on the date of my lease ending (mind you I had asked to receive a date 2 months prior as to not compromise my employer)....... and basically if I didn't accept on the day he had available that it would be moved out a week or more when it was convinent for them. :( He informed me that they were short employees and that's what he had available. When he completed my walk through I asked him what he wrote, logged, and took pictures of and he wouldn't show me. He just said he didn't find anything major wrong and everything he found was minimal ware and tare....but I had to sign that he did the walk through. This bothered me quite a bit. I hadn't heard back about my deposit. It has almost been two weeks. Although it was my plan to continue to rent through Tricon, the lack of communication via phone and email as the time for my lease to end came nearer I felt it best that I find housing elsewhere.

I would still rent with Tricon again, overall I was satisfied with my home. It was great for my grandchildren and myself. -CB<//text>< time>

Update:
I received a call from a senior manager that explained to me that they are sorry that I was in a home that had several issues. They are refunding me my security deposit with is awesome as  I have purchased a home and will use my deposit towards my new home.

I would stay far away from renting properties from Tricon American Homes. They have too many properties to deal with and will not make your issues seem like they are important, ever.

I first moved into a property in the Houston area and when I moved into the place it was barely cleaned but I had to take the keys as I was coming in from out of town and wasn’t going to spend more money on a hotel. It was obvious that Tricon didn’t do an actual pre-inspection of this property. I discovered broken cabinet drawer in kitchen, chewed up blinds, overgrown bushes that should have been removed (blocking view of driveway), the steel rod at end of the driveway curb was completely exposed,  and all three of the sinks had caved in cabinets under them. The stove was hard wired into the wall so the clock worked but the stove did not. It took them 8 days to get it fixed after I discovered it the day after I got my keys. The day after I got my keys, I also realized I had no hot water and that required major repairs to the hot water tank that took 5 days for them to get to. Two weeks after moving in I came home to water coming thru the ceiling in my kitchen. Took them 4 days to get someone out with the diagnosis being the new AC was installed without a drip pan to drain. That took 8 total days to get fixed. Fast forward a few months later and I go out of state to get married and move my new bride to Texas into the rental property. We walk into the house after me being gone for 5 days and I have major water leaking thru the celling in the dinning room. While I was gone the pipes in the bathroom broke. It took them 3 days to get someone out to look at it and a total of 9 days till the celling and toilets were fixed. The water leaking ruined about $600 worth of kitchen appliances that were sitting on a metal shelving. The leak also cost me another $300 in that months water bill.

With all of this my new bride and I decided to break our lease and look into buying a home before we had any other issues. Tricon did not give me any leeway with the two month lease breaking penalty indicating the issues I had in the rental home were mostly things that come up with normal rental homes. The exact wording from an Assistant Portfolio Manager was:

It appears that although you’ve had maintenance issues,  all were resolved. They’re going to be repairs needed, which is just the nature of renting a house. We’re sorry for any inconvenience and we are here to help when issues arise or for any questions you might have.

That is actually absurd as very few homes ever had two major water leaks in a 6 month time frame not to mention all the other issues I had with renting from them.

And before management contacts me saying we are so sorry that you had these issues and how can we resolve this someway, the only way at this point is to actually give me my deposit back as I had to use it to cover half of the early lease breaking penalty.< /text>

<text>I have been renting with this company for 12 months didn't have any issues until it was time for me to put in my 30 days notice. I started to receive email stating that I was not going to receive my security deposit back if I went over two days after my lease then the home manager stated that I did not put in a proper 30 day notice which I did. After I told her I was going to speak with a lawyer she told me that it was her fault. Now I have a couple of days to move out the home and I received a email stating that I need to pay a month to month fee because I went over two days after my lease this company is a complete rip-off. I would not recommend this company  to anyone because their money hungry and will do anything to get money from their tenants.

If I could give 0 stars I would.My wife and I was discriminated against when applied for a property with this company. I guess they dont want gay couples in their properties, however we met all qualifications listed on their site and yet were denied without a reason why. This is ridiculous!</Review>

If you are looking to rent run away from this people. I had a $1900 deposit only got back $500. The house was left in good shape clean. I even cover holes from cutains. Just for them to repaint. Like in most places.
They  even charge me for new carpet when there was a juice stain. The carpet guy said he could come back to fix it.
No one walk the property with me. I call I was expecting someone. They said to just leave the keys. I try to discuss the situation they said the discution time was expired.  It took my check to get to me almost 2 months.
If I would of known that I was going to lose my money I would of rented an apartment.  God knows how hard people work to have there stuff together.</Review>< Rating>

How do you get a hold of this company?! I was part of the Silver Bay switch at the beginning of May and have been trying to call for weeks now. My May rent was paid to Silver  Bay and is showing as an outstanding charge on my account with Tricon. I have not once gotten a live person on the phone and not one of my voicemails have been returned. I was happy with Silver Bay and now after reading several reviews and my own experience thus far, Tricon is making a HORRIBLE first impression. Obviously I am not the only one having issues but it seems to me that if you can't keep up with your residents then you may not need to expand. From the looks of it the only response anyone is getting is from leaving reviews so I guess I'll try this.</text>

< review>
We put in a maintenance request 4 months ago for our leaking roof (two spots). Someone came out and put a tarp on it and we have not heard any kind of FIX or solution - other than the roofers, while putting the tarp on, telling us they cant believe the roof is still attached because it is so old. Now, we have leaks in FOUR spots. I called before hurricane Irma hit us to ask for some kind of reinforcement and was told there was nothing they could do. Really???? A hurricane was coming and I was told to deal with it. Having me and my family endure a hurricane with a compromised roof DIRECTLY put our lives in danger. I tried to call the day after and was told I would be called back that day - did that happen? Of course it didn't! I have tried to call 3 times today and am currently on hold, once again. Not sure what it is going to take to get our roof fixed... Maybe call code enforcement? Fill out a hold of rent form with our lawyer? Its a shame that Tricon cares so little about residents that I have to go through all of this to get a hold of anyone to get answers, not to mention, literally endure hurricane force winds when we know our roof is so fragile (and leaking). This has been a nightmare for my whole family - especially my daughter.

I have tried every means of contact - maintenance requests, calling, email, FB message...

This is NOT the product we signed to rent. The product we signed up to rent is a safe home. Not one with a 30 year old roof and a tarp - not to mention, the decorative and attractive water stains we have on the inside of our home :/

I am not a complainer and can usually find positivity and understanding in almost every situation - but I think I have given Tricon more than enough time to rectify this and have grown exhausted with making up excuses for a company who makes it clear they do not care.<//review>

I am beyond disappointed in this company. We live in one of their homes and have had the most difficulty trying to get our heat fixed. We live in North Georgia where it does actually get cold.  Our home has been 42 Degrees since Friday (January 5) Today is now Tuesday January 9. We called Friday at noon. This should have been treated as an emergency. We have a 7 year old child.

As of yet we still don't have a timeline as to when the heat will be fixed. We are beyond over it.</review>

I have received the worst customer service experience from Tricon that I have ever received in my entire life. I have rented from them for a little over 2 years now and in that time span I have had my house flood a total of nine times.
Each time they send an incompetent vendor to my house to try and fix the problem and to this date there has been no solution.
My house flooded again on 9/3 it is now 9/5 and I have yet to hear from Tricon about how they will resolve this issue. There office never calls to give updates they only give your phone number out to their vendors so you can schedule your own work order.
I have sent numerous emails to this company and I only ever get vague responses. Not once in the nine times my house has flooded has Tricon apologized or compensated for the numerous times I’ve had to miss work to deal with this issue or for the fact that myself and my 6 year old have to live out of my living room due to the flooding in my bedrooms. My experience with this company has been absolutely horrible.</review>

<Text>Tricon is great once you go through the move in process. HOWEVER once u move in things change.  SOMEONE at Tricon cancelled all my utilities (GAS, WATER, ELECTRICITY) while I'm living in the home.  I found this out thru an email.   The problem is that I now have to reapply for all the utilities and pay additional fees that I paid already when I first moved in.  This also includes me having to take the time to redo applications again.
Tricon made this mistake and all I was offered was an apology and that they would only pay a reconnect fee. THIS WAS NOT MY FAULT BUT I AM THE ONE PAYING THE PRICE.</Text>< pictures>

It was a very good experience moving to my rental property with the help of Tricon staff, from A to Z paper work, maintenance wise and inspection at the time of taking over the house was absolutely amazing.  Specially thanks to Mr Julian Ospina and Mr Eddie Sobrinho to help me with some issues around the house and fix them ASAP for me. Guys you deserve a 5 star from me. Thanks again.< /Text>

I understand it is California-based, but they need to redirect the customer to an appropriate office- having to call California to get for them to get in touch with the Charlotte, NC office and then having to wait for the NC office to get in touch with me takes much too long and multiple showing and information requests have been lost along the way. Overall very slow and untimely service. The agents and customer service people themselves have been nice and helpful so far but the process to get to them is not justified.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

Tricon American Homes has been nothing short of the best property management company I have done business with. Everyone is so hands on from Carmen my property manager, Diana, Todd ,Leo , Brian everyone when there's a issue they do everything they can to make it right. Being a renter can be scary when you have things break in the home but with Tricon they keep there properties up and manage them well. I even had 2 Managers some to visit me and my family to see the issue and compensated me and resolved the issue now that's service.I recently had a safety emergency not related to my home they stepped in and accommodated me Kudos to Tricon of Southeast Florida! I'm a professional I expect nothing but the best and Tricon provides more than the best. I think I've spoken with the whole office and everyone has always followed up im very proud to be a resident on a scale of 1 to 10 I give them a 10!< /Review>

I have been renting with Tricom for one year and half. So far so good. They always fix the house on time when I needed it. The person that been helping me the most called Carmen Bengochea. She is very nice and professional . She responds my email fast and solve the problems fast. I would recommend to contact her if you need to rent a house. She is the best.<//review>

The lease renewal, A1 service. I recently did a very tedious (on my part) lease renewal with Dawn and she was very patient, prompt, knowledgeable and thorough and we were able to get everything done literally a day before my current lease expired. The customer service of Dawn was stellar. She is why I resigned my lease for another 2 years! Thank you very much.

How quickly customer service can go downhill. This is a horrible management company. The discrimination complaint will expose this company for their horrible discriminatory practices and insensitivity to a protected class.<//review>

this is a WARNING!!!! Do NOT, I release do NOT use Tricon to purchase or rent your home. If I could give a zero for a score I most certainly would. I won’t go into fulldetail details but I will share that my home was scheduled to be ready by Monday October 1, 2018 and it is now October 10th. I explained to my property manager Shanae Wiggins that I need to be moved in by last week and the lack of urgency and concern has troubled me. She offered my roommate and I to look at new homes but we constantly had to communicate that we were told that the house would be ready by the first and we have looked for a house for 2 months. We saw this house. Fell in love and needed to sign the lease abs be moved in before October 15th. We have tried several times to get in contact with the supervisor Mark in the Atlanta area and still have not heard and spoken with him. This has caused unnecessary stress and a tremendous frustration. So I repeat, DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH TRICON AMERICAN HOMES!<//Review>

<username>William Coppola</username><Time>1548040072284< /Time><rate>1</rate><Text>What an incredibly immoral company. My aunt just died of Stage 4 lung cancer, and amidst my family's emotional struggle trying to make arrangements for her funeral/burial, they now have to deal with the immoral snakes at Tricon. Despite her untimely death, they are seeking a 2-month penalty for "early lease termination." Have you ever heard of anything so icky and immoral in your life? The woman has died of cancer, and they want to charge a penalty fee because she didn't complete the terms of her lease? Disgusting.

If only for morality's sake, I'll be staying FAR away from Tricon and their unethical business practices. Absolutely horrifying.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Update: Tricon mailed the security deposit. The problem was resolved quickly.

If I could give no stars I would. I moved out of the rental property on 7/31. I called the office during the last week of August and was told that the check was on its way and that it was sent on 8/15. It is now 9/7 and I have still not received my deposit. The person who I spoke to in August said that she would look in to it and that she would get back to me. She said that she was going to provide me with her direct line-but she hung up! Needless to say that she never got back to me with further information. I am not the only person who has had this type of issue with the company (read the other negative reviews). This is unacceptable. Calling customer service is no help because you reach a call center that cannot provide any real information. It is impossible to get a direct line or to get a simple email. The state of Texas requires that former tenants receive their deposit back within 30 days.</Text>

Charlotte, NC location is horrible. Have neighbors that have bed bugs at one of your rental houses in Matthews, NC. - your office keeps sending out local exterminating company that only chemical treats, so fat 3 times, again this week. The only thing that will kill bedbug eggs and bedbugs is heat treatment. They are in the wall baseboards, the outlets, carpet,  now they are in all their furniture.  So even if they move out, your house still infested with bed bugs and the eggs. Who wants to rent from a company that treats their renters and their rental houses this way? Until this is resolved, we along with all our neighbors and friends and relatives will continue letting everyone know what kind of sad service you are providing,along with the scary thought of your rental houses having bedbugs.</review>

I’m renting a house from this company, and their customer service is awful. I was suppose to move in on the 16th and I was unable to move in until the 21st and the house still was not ready for move in. The floors were disgusting, the carpet had stains in them but I was told that they were already cleaned, but when I got there they were not. My hardwood floors are coming up and those have not been fixed. The paint was chipped off of my cabinets, I am missing shingles, some appliances were messed up, my sprinkler head is broken. Somethings did get fixed AFTER I had to continuously bring it to their attention. Currently, my shingles are not fixed, nor are my floors. I also had to make another  deposit for my lights because they told the lighting company to switch the lights to their name and out of mine. Since Tricon had the lights switched over to them, the lighting company closed my account so I had to open a new account and I had to pay a $400 deposit. I’ve been missing work so I could get caught up with the house since Tricon did not do wphat they were suppose to do, and I should not have to miss work to makeup for their mistakes. My last house I was at was also though Tricon. They did not do my move out and now I’m getting eviction notices on that house. I’m not able to get my security deposit for this house because they did not do the move out. I asked for a conssession and they are making excuses and not giving me one. All of this being said I DO NOT RECOMMEND TRICON AMERICAN HOMES TO ANYONE.

I lease a home from Tricon in Charlotte, NC.  I recently had an emergency at my home where the plumbing was leaking from the shower.  Water was going all over the floor.  I called the maintenance department and they were really great.  They sent a vendor out right away to fix the problem and the head of their maintenance department called me personally to make sure that my family and I were alright.  I wanted to thank Mike Nelson for genuinely caring if we were OK and making sure things were fixed to our satisfaction.  I never thought a large corporation would care that much.  I would definitely recommend Tricon to anyone of my friends.< /text>

<user_name>Travelbuff<//user_name><time>1524576997276< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Maintenance Tech Hurther Baker, from the Charlotte area office - possibly THE best tech we've ever had in our home??  Friendly, nice, easy to have a conversation with, all while being exceptionally professional and knowledgeable.  Wow.  I'm probably a bit more critical than most people when it comes to service and I don't easily write 5-star reviews, but there is nothing more I could possibly hope for in a home tech than the service Mr. Baker provided.  He knocked out 4 'minor' maintenance issues within 1-hr, and from my observation and knowledge of the issues, he fixed them all the RIGHT way - not the quick-let-me-outta-here way.  I don't believe we'll have these same issues bother us for as long as we stay in this house.

In general, we've found Tricon to be very responsive to maintenance issues (although I'm happy to report that we've rarely ever encountered maintenance issues).  However, it's great to know that even in the rare event that we do have an actual maintenance issue (even 'minor', non-emergency ones), Tricon has people like Mr. Baker on staff who knows how to fix things and is the absolute nicest, most professional person you'll have the fortune of having in your home.  Thank you Mr. Baker.< /review>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Pedro was very helpful and reported everything as it needed attention.  As for Tricon American homes beware! The experience I have had is horrible.  I have a bathroom that has mold(see pics). The bathtub's pitch is outward instead of inward and water is always everywhere. The wall to the shower has regular drywall and its now catching mold.I complained about my floor tile coming lose due to water underneath and poor installation,  what they did is find some tile that doesnt match the floor and installed a patch job leaving my house with three differnt types of tiles in the house. My wash and dryer are being ruined due to the car port having a leaking problem . During the hurricane a tree fell on the house and it had to be cut, well its still in the back yard, thats a year later. I can go on and on with all the problems in this house. When you call Tricon and they repair, they do the worst job as if the people doing the repairs don't know what they are doing. Oh did I mentioned that me and my boyfriend have been constantly sick due to the mold and moisture that Tricon has ignored. I assure you this is true the pics are there. And here is the best part, I am being charged more in rent for a smaller house than a home down the street thats bigger by 400sqft. I have called and asked to speak to the property manager and she has never even bothered to return my calls.  My next step is to call the county inspectors and have them inspect the house.<//text>< Pictures>

Upon having to move for work, I paid the lease termination fee along with the last months rent. After a while I’m sent a final bill including the termination fee again, after submitting a bank statement to Tricon showing that it was paid they never responded and then sent the “bill” over to collections. I don’t know if you caught that but that means they wanted me to pay the fee twice. I don’t think so.< /text>< Pics>

GARBAGE RENTAL COMPANY!!!! DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!!  I have never written a review about anything ever before! This company is so terrible that I need to write something to help out others!!
In Sept. 2017 Hurricane Irma hit FL,  Damage to the roof was not fixed for 3 MONTHS! I made maintenance requests over and over...nothing... called...nothing...posted on their Facebook page....nothing.... When they finally came out they did such a terrible job I would have rather paid for it myself to be fixed!
Jan. 2018 - FL gets 30-35 degree weather, I find out our heater doesn't work. I many an emergency request, 2 days later.. nothing! Call and they said oh call the vendor and ask them...seriously?!?! I have never had to go looking for vendors with any other property management company. I finally get a hold of the vendor and Tricon didn't even send them the request until I called!. 2 days with no heat, no communication, NOTHING!

Please do not rent from Tricon American Homes! TRUST ME! If anything goes wrong in the house, expect to have to either do it yourself or wait MONTHS to get it fixed.< /text>

<userid>112809702575060755802</userid><text>This company has been nothing short of a nightmare and even one star is too many to give to them! Upon move in the house was not move in ready like they said it would be. Cobwebs, dead bugs, trash throughout the backyard hidden under years worth of leaves, a toilet with gunk all in the bottom that they conveniently left closed upon inspection, and of course when I attempted to contact the leasing agent she completely ignored me since all the money was in place and I now no longer was important to them. I dealt earlier in this year with them taking FIVE weeks to get maintenance out to the house to fix both showers that were leaking inside the walls and down into the garage where there were electrical issues. Granted afterwards they tried to “make up” for the inconvenience of it by coming out and cleaning the air ducts (which they did) and were supposed to remove all the poison ivy from the backyard (which did not happen and when I tried to get info on the status of it received no response). Now I’m at the end of my lease and for six weeks I have been trying to confirm my renewal (only staying because I don’t want to move again at the moment), and no one seems to know how to return emails or phone calls, and now I’m being charged a “month to month” fee because of the fact I haven’t been able to confirm my renewal and my current lease isn’t even up yet!

Aside from that issue, I had several trees removed from the backyard around 6-7 weeks ago. The company came out and was using a bobcat to pull the fallen trees up through to the front yard where the chipper was in the driveway. I came home to tracks through my front yard that still have not fully grown back with grass to this day, and with divets and piles of dirt throughout the backyard, so bad to where if you walk back there you’ll either trip or sprain your ankle if you aren’t paying close enough attention. I called Tricon immediately, and they did nothing about it.

Because of the slope of the yard there is a washout problem already back there and water pooling up at the house when it rains, and there is now a new crack in the foundation because of it. At the same time I called about how the backyard was left post tree removal,  I told them about the issue with the yard and sent video. They told me they were going to look into it and after a month finally approved for French drains to be put in and “a company would be contacting me to set up an appointment,” and if you can guess, a company still has not contacted me about it weeks later. The washout is so bad that parts of the bottom of the driveway are completely exposed and there is a growing trench down the side of the yard from the water flow.

Earlier in the year a pipe in the garage broke and flooded the garage and I had to go out and buy a wet dry vac and everything necessary to fix it, which luckily my boyfriend is capable of doing, because I know on a Sunday even an “emergency” maintenance call to this company would most likely not be returned quickly. I was told someone would contact me in regards to a reimbursement for materials and that never happened. To add to it, I have rotting back doors that have not yet been approved to be replaced, a front porch that is also rotting step by step and I’ve had to replace boards on myself, and on top of all the mess they are upping my rent, which I would understand if this place wasnt in a condition of deterioration, but it’s the complete opposite.If moving were an option for me right now I would be running for the hills!<//text>< resp>

Our listing agent, David Dozier, was very responsive and professional. I've dealt with some agents that are pushy sales people but Dave seemed truly interested in making sure we had the right home. He was at the house early and always returns our calls and messages. I also want to mention Marjorie Menoff, our Assistant Portfolio Manager has been absolutely amazing during the onboarding process. She is very prompt, informative, and polite with my questions. Marjorie has made the leasing and pre-move-in process a breeze. We are looking forward to our walk through of the new rental in a couple of weeks.<//text>

<review>If I could give them a zero starts I would. I have 3 kids under three and a wife so life is busy for me however, Horrible customer service, horrible experience with this company. I have called over 5 times and sent multiple emails to inquire about my deposit, which I have not yet received, and no one has helped me or sent me to someone that will. It's been over a month since I moved out and still no idea what is going on with MY MONEY. I just got off the phone with them again this morning and explained the situation and still no help. All Rudy said was he could leave the property manager a message. Do not recommend this company at all.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This is by far the worst rental experience we have had. House was not and still is not rental ready  i have submitted so many work orders i have lost count  Now on a sunday we have to have a plumber come to clear sewer for the 3rd time. Backed up into the house for the third time  I call and get the run around from everyone. Needless to say my first experience with tricon is not a positive one.

I have a update on my sewer problem. Still plugged because they sent someone to pump the sewer tank we do not have. We have city sewer. They do not even know what is in their homes. No wonder they can not repair anything properly. I would be embarrassed to admit i own this company. Very poor service all around. Hard to repair when you have no clue what you have in the house.

One more update. Owner responded that my issue was repaired. Only thing is, the plumber is back because the new piping is plugged worse that the old piping.< /Text>

I see all these negative comments below, and i am baffled. I just want to thank the Team of people Tri Con has, that was able to help make my situation a whole lot easier for me.  Fast and quick to fix anything that goes wrong in the home. I have been in the house couple weeks now, and already this place has proven that they about their homes!
Thank you TriCon from bottom of my heart i will forever be grateful <3

<Review>I found a property in Georgia & it is beautiful & I have no complaints about it.  But I do have a complaint about the people handling maintenance issues. I moved into the property at the end of June & the first week in, I noticed that one of the toilets constantly ran after is was flushed...the same issue I brought up to the agent as he as showing me the property.  They got someone out to fix it in a timely manner, but the problem came trying to get reimbursed for an extremely high water bill.  I got the run around for so long about that, that I had to go thru someone else, other the property maintenance supervisor, to take care of my credit, which didn't happen until the following months bill generated.  By then, late charges have accrued, but I am having a hard time trying to get Tricon to take care of these fees as well. I call & leave message & send emails, but I never get any response..HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!< /Review><UserId.>113024855639583422188<//UserId.><date>1477330568972< /date>< rate>

I'm just going to say that I'm reading these reviews and notice that the 5 star ratings have a response from the owner but the customers with a complaint have nothing. That's extremely off putting. Tricon might want to consider that.<//review>

<Review>The entire new lease / rental procedure was a smooth process.  Yolanda Jones and Gina Nelson were very helpful with all of our questions throughout the entire process.  Our agent Bryan Lundien and Jerry (maintenance guy) were both on site for the early morning walk-thru.  It was helpful that Jerry was able to take care of most of our minor repairs / adjustments prior to receiving the keys.  And those items he was not about the complete, were handled in just a few days through the Work Order process.  The WO team is friendly and timely in their responses.

I have reach out Gina Nelson with questions and she is also very helpful.

So far Tricon American Homes seems to be a great company to have on our side!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user>109096630699768102901</user><rating>5<//rating>< Gmap_id>

< review>
I found a house on Zillow, put in a request to view, and there my journey began. I was able to promptly view the property using Tricon's lockbox system, whatever time I saw fit. I was contacted the next morning by Sarah, who greeted me with a warm text and took it from there. Application was quickly and questions were answered so fast it was almost unbelievable. Every single individual I dealt with in this company made this an easy process including Sarah, Gina, Michelle and Yolanda... They were an AMAZING team, I appreciate the opportunity to have worked with them. Thank you TRICON AMERICAN HOMES for such great experience and employees.< /review>

UPDATE: Received an email from Ms. Lisa Marie Grow (Administrative Assistant), she apologized and resolved my issue. If it was not for her I will still be waiting for a call back from Customer Service. I am glad she responded to my email.

I have been trying to reach Tricon Customer Service for about a week now regarding my rent. I have left several messages and no call backs. I have an email from Silver Bay Management staff stating that my rent will not be changed and everything will remain the same but yet I have an $150 month to month fee with this new company. This is not correct and it is very upsetting. Does anyone have a number or email that I can have so I can call directly. I have never paid my rent late and would like my situation handled before the deadline. Right now I have no choice but to give it a star because it would not let me post anything unless I chose a rating.</Text>

< Review>
If you have an appointment with Maritza Llanos, do not waste your time -she won't show up.
Set an appointment over the phone with a very nice man for a home for rent. Unfortunately the agent only accepted appointments from 11am to 3pm which seemed like a pretty small window to me considering it is a huge part of an agent's job. But my boyfriend and I took off work anyways to make the 3 pm appointment.
After waiting over an hour the agent,  Maritza Llanos, never showed up. I called and asked what was up and they told me they couldn't get ahold of her but that they would try and get me the lockbox code so I could view the property. Waited another half hour and still nothing. I called again and they said the house had been rented by the time I was sitting there waiting.
Are you serious? Is this even a legit business? My boyfriend and I took work off to see this house and the agent doesn't even have the courtesy to call and apologize for not being able to make it? Doesn't tell us the place has been rented just makes us lose money that we could be making at work to wait around for two hours.
Funny thing is, I thought the main business line was pretty friendly so I scheduled another appointment for another place. But again, the same agent,  Maritza Llanos. I called an hour before to make sure she'd be there this time and they tell me I shouldn't even go to the appointment because she hasn't been calling anyone back. How is Tricon even renting these places out if no one can see them and no one can get a hold of the only agent that can? I don't like telling people how to do their jobs but you would think there would be some effort to actually do them.
Honestly I wouldn't recommend Tricon to anyone that wants to keep their sanity. The call center was incredibly friendly but they really need to fire  Maritza Llanos if she's not going to do her job.<//Review>

My husband and I inquired about a home in Houston, TX through our personal realtor. I'd questions for him to ask the Tricon agent. I specifically asked was it flooded followed by a numerous other questions. The agent had a piss poor attitude, failed to connect with my agent, until I emailed her and told her to get with my agent PLEASE. Then she sugar coated the fact that the home was flooded by saying 'it had minor damage and some sheetrock was replaced' so it WAS flooded, right? Question was never directly answered by the way (Sugarcoating). The home had been on the market for QUITE SOME TIME.. even a 1st month's free rent (which was MAGICALLY taken off when we submitted an application..go figure). So to even it out, I gave TWO options (because 1st months free rent magically disappeared, the home was up for $1299)... I sign a 2 yr lease for $1200.. or a 1 yr lease for $1250. Then I brought up the fact it'd been on the market for so long, the flooding question being sugarcoated, and the fact that it was posted for 1st months free rent, I got a cancellation email saying my lease to be signed has been voided. My husband and I are well qualified but because this agent has NO MANNERS, I will never see myself doing business with Tricon home. Common courtesy is.. to reach out to either my agent that you'd been avoiding or myself to let us know our options aren't something she is willing to accept. Not immediately void the lease and no email with a 'thank you for applying, but no we aren't accepting your options or thank you for applying but we have specific needs' or trying to offer us any other home that may fit our needs, no suggestions on other homes, no nothing. Just an email that said your lease contract has been voided.......wow. I will let my friends and family know about your business and the shadyness in it. Glad we dodged a bullet.
Thank you, but REALLY... NO THANKS, I'd skip this agency guys! The house is STILL on the market and by June 15th it will have been 3 months sitting..............................
(TRICON REP/realtor: ERIN WARD)

Update: Since this review, she emailed back apologized and described the reason for sheetrock repair (leakage), explained they have 'specials' and that they change daily (reason for not honoring the 1st months free rent), and still are only offering my personal realtor less than half deposit which is still unfair because he basically did all the foot work and all they are doing is looking over what he already has. That's great and all, and thanks to whomever MADE her reach out to us.. but again, we will pass. 👎🏽</Text>

Was looking at a house to rent that was managed by this company. They wouldn't allow me to view the property before I had to make a non refundable deposit.

<text>So I wrote a WARNING review BEFORE...but deleted it to give the company the benefit of the doubt. If you want REAL INFORMATION...THIS IS LONG BUT NECESSARY TO SPARE YOU HEADACHES.

If I could do anything to help avoid what I am going through....this is it. DO NOT RENT FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!!!! The homes are nice so that will make lots of people consider but I GUARANTEE YOU; move out is a NIGHTMARE. You will give them sufficient notice avd they will act as if you NEVER did to either lock you into a higher month/month OR charge you for "insufficient notice". I gave them notice on AUGUST 15TH that I had to move out of the property because I was hospitalized but I STILL PAID MY RENT MONTHLY (I was waiting out the remainder of the lease). I paid Sept & Oct rent all while STILL trying to get someone to reply to my move out request. No one ever replied.....I had to pay a lawyer at this point to contact them. They finally reached out mid Oct and dated all of my move out forms for Oct 12...but HOW; WHY? I contacted you guys abs submitted the move out request in AUGUST. Now they're charging me for "insufficient move out time". Im not the one who was "insufficient", Tricon & their communication is what was insufficient but you want ME to pay $700 because YOU ignored my requests? I'm do glad I print every email & CC my legal council because NOT TODAY SATAN!!!!!

*updated on Thursday, Nov 8: if you reach out to them & they ignore you too... LEAVE A REVIEW OF YOUR EXPERIENCE! That'll get a nice swift response :)<//text><Date>1541697747781<//Date>< resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>We've rented our home in Whiteland, Indiana since 2016. We are the first renters in the home since Tricon American purchased the home. The previous owners didn't treat the home with the most respect... and so little by little we've uncovered some major problems as the years go by.

Tricon has repeatedly been on top of their game fixing everything as it comes; and they've been an EXCELLENT company to work with time and time again! We LOVE our house (despite its previous abuse) and plan to stay here until we decide to build or buy another home!

True credit goes to our rep, Janet Oliver, for always going above and beyond! GIVE THIS WOMAN A RAISE! Lord knows she's taken enough abuse from us to deserve it!! :D

before move in, we were told that we qualified for the 2 weeks off rent of February and March, since that was a good discount, husband paid February and march rent and gave the money orders to the company real estate agent.
Come March, we get an email saying that they have not received march rent, and to evacuate the property. After emailing back and forth to clarify the situation. they apologized. Come 1 week later we get a letter in the mail that they want to evict us. so angry right now.... left the 3 stars for maintenance. it has so far been the only good thing about this place. they come out right away...company is run by air heads.< /Text>

This is our first time renting with Tricon American Homes and I was beyond impressed by the lovely selection of houses they have. Brian Holzwarth and his team made our transition to moving into our new home very welcoming. Wendy Fabel and Todd Devine did an awesome job managing our home. Definitely will recommend to friends and relatives!</Text>

if i could give 0/10 stars i would. the home my boyfriend and i moved into, was a home full of damages and issues (which i have my own documentation as well) Monica stated that these issues would be fixed before receiving keys, i can assure you no-one even so much as visited the home. even as early as the application phase my boyfriend had THE hardest time reaching Felicia, shes very uninterested in her job and its apparent. ive lived in the home 3 months, and The agent monica KNEW this as she gave the keys to us BOTH and my boyfriend introduced us, i was there to view the home and accept keys. not once did she ever state that i also had to do an application. now we are 3 MONTHS INTO living at this property with INSANELY RUDE NEIGHBORS i  might add, and NOW we are just NOW being told i need to apply to live in the residence??? do not rent from them, your issues wont be fixed, youll get the run around, and even deal with attitude when you are the frustrated tenant trying to ask questions, and you will be treated like a problem!< /review>

I'm 6 months in to my first lease with Tricon.  Shortly after I moved in I identified a drain leak and drain fly infestation, the plumber Tricon sent out recommended moisture remediation and a lime treatment for the crawl space that still has not been completed.  A month or two later my HVAC system shut down due to a carbon monoxide safety feature, the contractor reported a rusted heat exchanger that required replacing the entire unit.  Noted an odor in the attic and reported it, contractors in hazmat suits went in and ventilated the attic over a weekend while I was in the house.  They indicated that repairs were needed to prevent recurrence, those have not been acted on.  Tricon doesn't answer phone calls or respond to voice mail.  Contractors have hauled two trailer loads of debris from the yard since I moved in, the photos show the debris piles that remain and the areas of the yard that have not been touched.  I don't know if this is a typical Tricon experience or if the property I am renting has slipped between the cracks.  So far I have been exposed to carbon monoxide and mold particles and can't get Tricon to detail my exposure for risk assessment.  If you are considering renting a home from Tricon please take my experience into account.  Good luck!

Update.  Tricon has been responsive since this post, an additional 8 trailer loads of debris have been removed from my backyard, I would estimate that we are about 80% of the way to acceptable.  The HVAC system has been replaced and they installed a carbon monoxide detector.  I am being called weekly to report status and appreciate the effort to make this right.  The folks I have dealt with seem to be genuinely interested in fixing this, I think they have added so many homes at such a rapid pace that staff is overwhelmed.< /Review>

I just recently rented a home from Tricon American Homes. Not only was the home very clean up to date and very well kept, but the real estate agent Amira Elchorbagy I worked with  ensured I was in my place as soon as possible and as smoothly as possible. If you are looking for well kept homes, in safe areas I recommend working with Tricon and if you can request Amira I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. Very excited and very satisfied with service.</review>

We just started renting with TAH and were a little scepticle at first. We had some minor issues with our AC so I called to have it looked at. I have been dealing with David K out of the Charlotte office and he has gone above and beyond to help fix the problem. I can’t say a whole lot about the company itself yet since we’ve only been here about a month, but I will say that they have atleast one very accommodating employee who does care about the customer!</Review>

So my experience with the San Antonio location was a disaster. I would not even give a one start for their review.  In the beginning of July I asked to view a home. I was advised the home would be available July 23, 2018. At that time I was 34 weeks pregnant. So the lady Gloria Perez  that worked with me asked me to view the home on July 11th. I get there and she does not have a key so we can view the home. She made promises for the upcoming weekend with me to view the home.  I called and text her about the weekend and on Saturday but she never responded. So I went online to look company up. I advised her I wanted to move in asap because she could see I was very pregnant. Come July 18th I still have not viewed the home but did go ahead and put in a application on the property because I did not want to miss out on the home. School is close to starting and I only want to focus on the baby coming. July 19th I got a welcome letter from Erin Butler with Tricon saying I can move in on July 23 2018. On July 20th the baby did not want to wait and I delivered my baby boy. I called Tricon a few times and finally a young lady emailed Erin to give them an update since I needed to send signatures on a few forms in two days. I asked for three days since I was at the hospital. After I spoke with her I got another email on July 20 from Erin Butler again asking me to sign forms. I signed the forms but upon reading the paperwork, it stated my move in date was 8/15/18 not 7/23/18. It took 5 days before my son got a response from Erin not me. I wanted a call but instead my son got an email saying yes move in not until 8/15/18. This was acceptable. I told Tricon I chose their home over the others I looked at soley on their home being available in July. I asked why would they change the contract and not call me. If I did not read the contract on my own I would have been left in the dark about the whole thing. Erin only said you can pick another home or we can give you your application fee back $90. I said please find me a home in the same area because I needed the children to be in same district and schools that I applied for. He finds a smaller home 30 minutes away in a different district.  This whole time I am calling Iam living in a hotel with my teenagers and my newborn. I agreed to move out my home on July 27, 2018 when I received my welcome letter on July 19th so thats why I was really upset. Tricon said they did not receive papers from my son 19yrs old signed. I asked them to please send forms to the same email you responded to when i asked for days for a call back on why the dates where changed but you emailed my son the response instead. I called my son and told him to email tricon and let them know he never received their emails. I made a change to his email address and it should have been on file.Then my son is informed that Tricon needed to reach out to their IT dept because for some reason they could not get the email to go through. By this time it is Aug 2, 2018.  Later that same day I get emails from Tricon admin dept stating they have cancelled our application for the home since my son did not sign forms. He is 19yrs old. He is only on paperwork because he is over 18 years old. I am the one paying the bill. So I am homeless and still at the hotel that i have already been at for 2 weeks and spent over $700 dollars on. I have never dealt with a company this disorganized and unprofessional. They did not care I was spending all this extra money because of them and their lack of communication. I have not had a chance to really enjoy motherhood with my newborn because of all of this and to just cancel my application again no call just emails is how I was being communcated with it is ridiculous. I hate I even reached out to them and I definitely will never refer anyone to them ever. I replied to admins emails saying I wanted my application fee back and of course I have not got a response which does not surprise me at all.

When Tricon American Homes received your application, a representative reached out to discuss the home not being available until August. The move-in date was mutually agreed upon and a lease agreement was emailed for signature. The lease was then voided, and the application cancelled, after 48 hours of no response. Once it was brought to our attention that you were unable to execute the lease agreement due to being hospitalized the application was reapplied and a new lease agreement emailed. Again, no response was received so the application was cancelled following standard company protocol. As of August 15, 2018, a full refund was issued to you. We wish you the best in the future with your rental needs and are here should you be interested in another Tricon American Homes property. Thank you.'}< /Response>

<Review>I am extremely happy with choosing Tricon American Homes!! I am fully aware and have personal experience's with landlords and the stressful hoops to jump through when you need maintenance. I rent a lovely 4BDR home in Indy, but it has had it's share of maintenance issues. However, I couldn't be more impressed with the Janet Oliver and her maintenance team!! Anytime that I have needed work done, it takes less than 48hrs for them to address the issue (depending on it's importance). Janet will take the time to call me personally if there is any problems or even to just inquire of my satisfaction of the work completed. I have never before had such a great experience when it comes to a maintenance department! Thank you so much for all you have done and all you continue to do Janet Oliver!!! She really does care about what she does and it shows in her quality of work and customer service!!! We do not plan on staying at our current location for a extended period of time, but when we look for a new place to rent... we will without a doubt rent from Tricon American Homes again!!
I also really appreciated all the assistance Amy Williams provided when we first came to TAH, she was awesome! TAH is a great rental company with a great team and I will recommend them to anyone!</Review>< Gmap_id>

Don't waste your time or money with this company. There is a reason they aren't accredited with the BBB. We moved across the country and were assured by the woman who met my husband at the property that she was going to be processing our application (which was a lie) despite my husband only being on his job for 3 weeks and us having substantial savings. Not only was the woman he met with not processing our application, but it wasn't even being processed out of her office, it was being processed in another state altogether. I received a call from the office in Charlotte saying they needed additional pay stubs so I called her back on a Wed saying we could have them on Friday. No response, 3 more calls went unanswered or returned and the 4th call I was hung up on and when I called back she sent me straight to voicemail. They pocketed our application fee and cancelled our application. Worst part is the house sat empty unrented for months, but from other complaints I've seen it looks like we dodged a bullet anyway. Despite not being accredited I filed a complaint with the BBB and Tricon took 7 months to respond. Steer clear, you've been warned!</Text>

I have been renting from Tricon for about 3 years now,  I must say that Ruby Baker has been so pleasant. She is very understanding and helpful, any question or concerns that I may have she  handles right away. Having her is definitely an asset to the company! Even though I'm renting I feel as if our house is our's. Wendy Fabel is also very nice and helpful. Kristen Blasko I thank you for all your hard work as well, you have exceeded my expectations on resolving an issue that  we had last month, and I thank you so much for that.  Keep up the great work to you all, it makes renters feel comfortable and appreciate the rental experience.

DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY YOU WILL REGRET IT!!! We had issues all the time, lived there 5 years raised our rent $400 in that time. They will find anyway to screw you, every way they can. We finally moved out and waited, called and waited to get someone to schedule a final walk thru, finally when we got our appt and the guy that was scheduled to do our walk through never showed up! Shady company and then we were told to just leave the keys in the house, Never got our $2000 deposit back.

Tricon is perpetually disappointing. Their maintenance is a joke. I called them about my dishwasher not working and and my dryer taking two hours to dry one load of clothes. The repair man was on a personal call in my kitchen for 20 minutes and then said he didn't know why the appliances weren't working and left. I never got any follow up. Then, I bought a house and was trying to contact my property manager about paying off my lease only to be ignored for 6 weeks! I finally called their main office and insisted they connect me someone immediately. I spoke with a woman who emailed me a notice to vacate form and has since ignored all of my communication. I would not recommend Tricon to anyone.< /Text>

<review>Rented a house with this company and had a horrible experience from day one and nobody cared. On move in day, AC was not working. Then had plumbing issues (leak in master bathroom on 2nd floor down into dining room on 1st floor TWICE) contacted emergency maintenance twice  and nobody came out until the next evening. Finally broke the lease (which they gave me a hard time about) and couldn’t pay online so By the time I was able to take off work and mail money orders for payment due, they mailed the payment back saying they had sent the account to collections. I lived at 18738 Parfield Lane in Houston and the House APPEARS beautiful but BEWARE.< /review><user>114925140543442696366<//user></record>

I have been living in a nice home of theirs for close to a year the home is nice but it had some issues at first , garbage left over not cleaned completely before moving in things we were told were gonna be done before  the move in wasn't so they were done while we were trying to live in the home. They kept billing us all kinds of stupid stuff, late fees when were weren't late and we had to get it cleared up, they made us set up our sewer account in our name, but the monies we gave them first for sewer they were to pay the utility company and never did then they tried to bill us again for the same bills we paid. The always try to bundle everything in your rent so either you pay it all and wait on a  refund or you don't pay it and get a late fee. I would pay what was due and that's it!!! Im glad we aren't renting from them to long,  THEY NEVER CALL YOU BACK SO DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON CALLING WITH ANY ISSUES!! VERY SLACK COMPANY AND DONT KNOW HOW TO TREAT THEIR TENANTS!< /review>

Updated with newer rating: Spoke with the supervisor (I think his name is Brent)who tried his best to resolve the issues but unfortunately it could not work out with no fault of his own. Although I don't agree with some of their logic they did respond swiftly, courteously, and refunded holding fees in a reasonable time. I would give a higher rating but I believe that the person I was originally dealing with( Cantuna)should have responded to my phone calls which would have probably changed my original review post.

This company has just proven to me to be a disaster. We applied to a home and submitted all that was necessary. They took more than 3-5 business days to respond. Then they state that I did submit the information they were looking for. I resent the information they were looking for and still they replied they did not receive it and decided to move forward and cancel my application. If you do end up applying for a home with this garbage company and have a Ms. Cantuna handling your application you are sure in for a ride of incompetence.<//Text>

< review>
A couple months ago we were given a sudden notice to leave our home that we've been staying in for so many years.  It was a very stressful situation, but Tricon Homes made this whole moving process a lot easier than we had imagined.  We were mostly working with Maritza, who I must say was AWESOME from beginning to the end. She was very sweet, quick to answer all questions and concerns I had (even though for a second I was probably being annoying with all the questions I kept asking her), and she went above and beyond making sure everything was all set for us before we moved in.

Upon moving in, we noticed some things that needed to be repaired and Maritza made sure someone reached out to us immediately.  We have been in the home since July, and we couldn't be happier with the decision we made on moving here.  I would highly recommend Tricon to anyone, and if you're working with Maritza you're definitely in great hands =))

PS- They offer the convenience of being able to pay your rent online, which a lot of places still does not do (Hello, it's 2017!!) The thought of not having to pay with a money order or check like the old-fashion way is GREATTTT!!  It's one less thing I have to worry about every month... =)</review>

<text>I have lived in a rental home of Tricon's for three years. Due to some of life's problems we have been late in rent many times. Marlene S. who is my account rep has not only been extremely helpful but polite and nice despite me causing her many a headache in arranging late payment many times. Tricon has their contracts they must uphold but I find they are still companionate and work with us as much as the contract allows.

I highly recommend this rental agency as they keep the home working and respond to any issues we have promptly and professionally.

My sincere thanks goes out to the team that works with us here in the North Bay California area. I have no doubt we would be homeless or living in a not so safe area if they had not worked with us so often even keeping within the contract guidelines.

Marlene is an exemplary employee and her customer service is on par with some of the best I have ever received.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I was an employee/foreman at the South Florida office. The office runs like a circus. The maintence manager sits on your request for maintence for hours. If you have a damaged ac unit make sure you call several times. I tired to change the atmosphere of the office and was booted out the door. The houses are old and need new roofs and a\c units. The maintence techs do whatever they want. They are rude to customer etc. If you want to make a change and treat the residence with respect and customer service this is not the place. They jack up your monthly rent and when you need service on your home they laugh about it. The office is run like a circus the coorporate atmosphere. let the people walk in the shoes of residence who have no a/c let them fell the heat. Try to change the customer service and you go out the door. Please rent from someone who cares. The owner who seems to be a professional HAS now paid me for longer severance pay he seems to be a professional and a good man. I hope he cleans that office up! I still need medical care for PTSD which I suffered in the work place but he is trying. Thank you to the owner. I do appreciate it! I hope he cleans house in the South Florida office. To me customer service is number one.<//Review>< Pics>

It seems repairing our AC unit in 90 degree weather is not a priority even when we have a child who suffers from asthma, so having a workable unit is crucial. All the charlotte location has given us is a disconnected number to their so called ac repair guy then tell us they are attempting to contact a 2nd party....mind you this was earlier this afternoon and now it is 1021pm EST. This is unacceptable. This problem needs to be fixed ASAP.

Any time we've had a issue she is right on-top of it. We have never had to go a day without hearing from them when we need help is something needs to be fixed. In-less its the weekend of course, but even then there is a 24 Hour help line that comes in handy.
I highly recommend Tri con to any and all who are looking to rent a home from a company who cares.
Thank you Alicia for always being there for us. You're one of a kind.

Terrible communication! When our home went under Tricon, they were obviously behind . Our renewal was August 2017. We did not get the lease until September 2018. I signed the lease but there were errors in the document so I informed our agent Jasiel. She said she would make corrections so we could sign again but never sent it back. Now in January 2018, we get an email from Jasiel informing us that we never signed and will go to a month to month starting 3/1/18 which is a $250 monthly increase unless we sign our renewal. I emailed back and called twice with no response.
I gave 2 stars because the service for maintenance was quick when we did request it and the maintenance repairs were completed. However, I am very dissatisfied with our renewal issue and their negligence in the matter as well as poor communication.

**Added after initial post**
After calling this morning and writing this review, our agent reached out and sent us the documents. I am happy that they fixed the issue and took responsibility for the problem. Jasiel apologized and I can respect an agency that is willing to acknowledge and accommodate for their mistake. I give TAH a 3 star rating now</review>

Took a tour of a home in the Greenwood area and fell in love with it. Went to fill out an application the same day. After uploading the appropriate documents I kept receiving an error code. I called the company for assistance and they told me I shouldn't have even been able to take a self tour or fill out an application because the property was already being leased out. My boyfriend called to verify this and they told him someone put in an application 2 days before our tour. They did confirm they texted me an access code for the self tour but never apologized for the inconvenience this was for my boyfriend and I. The listing was finally removed from the website about 1 hour after my boyfriend spoke to them. I am disappointed with the situation and the way it was handled.<//Text>

<Text>Update:
Shortly after my reviews were left they were in contact with my husband and have compensated us for our losses. It helped us get back on track and they were apologetic, but it's still a shame we had to go through what we did to get to where we are now.

I still would not recommend this company for your rental needs just based on our experience with maintenance and other issues in our last home.

- - - - - - - - - - - - -

DO NOT RENT with this company. If I could give them 0 stars, I would give them -3. Lol. If you value your time and money, save yourself the hassle and rent with someone (ANYONE) else.

We rented a home in Porter TX. Our a/c thermostat was broken for about 7 months costing us $450-$500 in electric bills EVERY MONTH. They kept sending out terrible help that would tell me what the problem could be, leave, and never come back to FIX it.  I seen like 10 different "technicians" until one finally fixed it. Same thing with our septic system, that was STILL not fixed before we left.

They told us we would get compensated through our rent ledgers, which happened once for like $400. So the women (more than one, yes...about 4 -AT THE HOUSTON BRANCH Angela, Jennifer, Amanda, Yolanda) who handled our case at different times informed us that they would come up with a reduced rent price for one more month(November). Everyone was all good and understanding until 3 months later, still no word on that months rent. Just an EVICTON NOTICE 2 months before our lease is up because we were waiting on a number from them!!!

It feels criminal, what they did to my family and I. We are so glad to be DONE with this company! I will never reccommed them to anyone. Worst rental experience ever! I feel bad for the people who get that home next...they will probably deal with the problems we had that never got fixed.</Text>< response>

<Text>Avoid dealing with Orlando, FL division!!! Extremely negative experience! All around poor rental agency, both as Silverbay and Tricon American Homes after the buy out. The lease was expensive, rent higher than average, and they will nickle and dime your deposit so don't plan on getting any of it back.

Started out the first week in the house unaware the house was rigged for natural gas. So didn't have hot water or a stove for 2 weeks.

House was full of german cockroaches from the start, very difficult to exterminate. Kitchen was built poorly and allowed roaches to fester in every crevice.

Maintenance requests were resolved incredibly slow and inefficiently. One time a guy came to fix the dishwasher and refused to put it back together because he wasn't familiar with the model.

Backyard fence was shotty and the yard had no grass, even though I was reminded frequently that upkeep was tenant responsibility.

On numerous occasions the management was contacted and a reply didn't solve the problem but just cited a generic rule or policy, very impersonal and rude at times.

Would look elsewhere for property management or deal privately. Tricon American Homes has poor customer service and is only looking out for their bottom line at all times. Avoid!!!< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Im writing this review according to my experience but can be subject to change in the future. They had a house both on MLS and on their own website showing active and I went to tour the place yesternight and actually loved it, hence the three star rating. However when trying to apply on the website it didnt let me go pass step one in the application process. Finally I called the tricon american homes phone number listed and it took 5 min or more both times I called to get a representative on the line not saying they weren't busy im just speaking from experience. However when I finally got a hold of someone the last time i was told that there was an application already turned in thats why i couldnt go pass step one. So my only complaint is that If a person has turned in an application you should at least make the house temp off the market or place it as pending until the the applicants are approved specially if they put an earnest or holding deposit on the house because its only right. In the end its misleading for people who are interested in your homes and haven't applied yet.< /Review>

I dont normally do comments and all but i have to truly admit on the service provided by Gloria Hathaway-Perez lead me to positng this comment.
I put myself on the market for a bigger home for me and my family.  Mrs. Perez was always there with a bright smile to show us properties after hours and accommodate my schedule since i work an 8-5 job.
She made home looking fun and exciting...   she inquired on what we were looking for and price range and meet those expectations and beyond.    I would highly recommended her service to any family, friends or anyone looking for their new home.  High five chica,  you had done a fantastic job and was greatly appreciated.

I'd give it negative 5 stars if I could.  Worse rental company there is. No communication, no calls, illegal aliens show up without notice to change things on the house.  They use my power they don't ask.  Company refuses to return my calls.  Scum bags</review>

We've rented from this company for 2 years and it has been a nightmare ever since. Between them never sending anyone to drain our septic tank for 2 years to multiple plumbing issues that by the way take months to get resolved. The most recent issue comes from a leak somewhere in out bedroom closet that has spread through the carpet and now smells like something died. Called by no help will continue to try and reach out. But will not be renewing due neglect of property and more so neglect of us as tenants. The same plumbing issue has happened once before in our sons room took them 2 weeks to get someone out here to our house. Rant over.< /text>

Went to sheduled appt to visit home. Got to the home early, after 30 min of waiting no one showed up. Called Tricon to find out they cancelled the appt, and already approved an applicant. No phone call, text, email or anything to notify us of the cancellation. Home still shows vacant online. Waisted our time<//review>

This has been one of my worst rental experiences this far. Maybe it is just the Atlanta team but I will never rent from them again and I've only been with this company for a week. It took over a week to view the home and get a application due to disorganization and lack of people following through with their job. I never got responses from calls or emails. The move in process and walk through was very unprofessional not to mention the home I have moved into was NOT cleaned and there is hair, dirt and crumbs from a previous resident. Now, day 9 of being in the home my heat is not working and a maintenance request has been submitted with NO URGENCY to be fulfillled. It's only 40 degrees outside. Needless to say, I love Tricon American Homes. Don't ever rent from them.</text>

He goes above and beyond to help residents with any problems in or out of his department. Tricon also has a great maintence department, the two times in 4 years i've requested them it was fast and professional with quality work. I tell everyone I know looking for a place to use Tricon American Homes and they want be disappointed.👍<//Review>< pictures>

TriCon purchased a home in my neighborhood that was obviously once well loved, but sat empty for years until it went on the market.  Within about 3-4 weeks of purchasing the home, TriCon completely renovated & repaired the home, bringing the once eye-sore back to life.  Our neighborhood is glad to see the house rented and well-cared for!< /Review>

< Review>
Document everything with Tricon.  I moved into a home in 2014 with a great management company.  Tricon took over in 2015, they sent me a new lease 4 months late after me regularly asking for it.  I had the house in perfect condition upon move out and they took $440.00 off my refund.  Without having the Correct Documentation according to the law.  Lucky I have the documentation of the walk thru and a video of it.  Now I had to file a BBB complaint and have to send them a demand letter to go to court and get my money back plus damages for time.  Horrible management.  This is my 7th rental in 8 years I am well aware of rights as a renter and I have never had my security deposit not returned in full/< /Review>

Hello Everyone , I've been with Tricon American Homes for about 5 months now &  i have nothing but great things to say about them! The people who work for this company are very professional & kind. The alway find a way to fix everything right away or if not the next day. They have quick maintenance for the properties& the houses are kept up very well ! The Assistant Portfolio Manager – Northern California, Alicia Carroll is amazing! She always emails me to make sure everything is great at the house & if there is anything that needs to be done or If I have an issue with the portal,  she try's to resolve it as quick as possible. TAH isn't like any other property management, they make you feel wanted & like a family . If you are looking for a great home & incredible people to help you along the way , I highly recommend Tricon American Homes ! Thank you guys for everything thus far!< /Text>

They dont care about the residence at all just the money they pay. My house got broken into, with no compassion at all asked me how soon could i be out?  So many ups and downs with this company  and never have they given me a reason to stay, more like i dont care about what happens to you, just pay or leave!< /review>

So far I am very disappointed in this company. I have a one year old and she can't even play in the yard because of all the weeds and no GRASS! I've sent pictures and keep sending in a maintance request and they keep deleting my request! This is outrageous! Also they won't put in a fence so neighborhood kids will stop playing on my child's play set! I've had to almost take the whole thing down and put a lock on it just so they would stop coming into my yard! I've done everything I can. Silverbay homes was a lot better than this...Also, Tricon American Homes tried to up my rent without me knowing trying to charge me an extra month to month fee of $150! I have never been late on my rent but if they won't answer their phones and call me back, I will be, which I will not be paying for because it is their fault! I even left a message! Wish they would put theirselves in other families shoes to see how it is not to get something fixed properly. If it was for them, they would be right on it. Sad how this world is now a days...<//review>

{'time': 1499996810788, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to express your concerns and allowing us to address them both offline and here online.  1) Lease Expiration & Month-to-Month Fees - Your original lease expired at the end of June 2017. Silver Bay reminded you of your upcoming lease expiration by a mailed letter prior to Tricon American Homes becoming your property manager in mid-May 2017. Once your lease expired, you became a month-to-month resident which incurs a premium of $150/month. However, per your conversation with the regional management team, as of July 1, 2017 you have resigned a long-term lease with us and the extra charge was removed from your account.  2) Lawn Maintenance - Silver Bay’s standard practice was to review this policy with all residents at the time of move-in. Communication notes from Silver Bay also state that they reminded you of lawn maintenance policy via email and mailed letter. The exact verbiage can be found under section 12 of your signed lease and states that the resident is responsible to maintain the quality of the lawn during their residency. 2) Fences - It is standard practice for Tricon American Homes to installs fences around rental homes if there are liability issues (pool, river, etc.). We hope this information is useful and addresses all your concerns. Should you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact us at (844) 203-8531. Thank you.'}< /response>

I am in a new home two days managed by TriCon and we are amazed at the quality of the workmanship.  We want to give a compliment to the Supe who oversaw the prep of our home.  My hubby is a Sr. PM for Commercial Construction and we are most happy.  There are minor issues we are waiting to get fixed, but overall wonderful.  I also want to compliment Julian Ospina for helping me with the overview of my home.  Finally my leasing agent Amira Elchoraby was a super professional and I would like to work with her in the future.  Thank you and we look forward to the future!<//text>

Our company is a residential home repair and remodeling company. We have been contracted with Tricon American Homes for almost a year, now. I must say, the experience has been nothing short of phenomenal. We have been in business for several years, so we are contracted with several property management companies and residential rental companies. Tricon has been by far the best company we’ve dealt with. They treat their contractors with the upmost respect and care about building long term business relationships.
Potential renters: If you are looking for a home to rent, look no further. Tricon American Homes take care of their tenants. I have never worked with a residential rental company that goes far and beyond to meet their resident’s demands. They take pride in the upkeep of their properties and protecting their assets.
Thank you Tricon, Yolanda Zamzam , Michael Trumbature and Ken Parker for adding the success of our business.< /Text>

Last thing you want is to rent a house from them.
They will lie to you, no manager ever present at the office, it takes about 10-20 minutes for you to reach someone by phone, some times they pick up and hang up right a way.
They will evict you 4 days after rent is due which is illegal in nc.
They will try to collect money for rent after you have moved out.
Do not ever rent a house with them.

All good reviews are fake, I talked to people in my neighborhood and they all have same problems with them.< /Review>

Firsy off, the one star is for the people working at this company, who were courteous
and professional.. The rest 👎🏽. Unprofessional leasing agent!. Called a week in advance to have a walk though.. said home would not be ready until February 1st. Asked if I could apply, was then told I should look at the place first before applying.  Ok so an appt was finally made for a walk through for the 1st of Feb. I called the day b4 to confirm my appt. I was then told, someone put an application on Jan 30th.. 🤔.ok thought the home wasn't ready,and thought a walk through was needed first.. I was also told that the leasing agent would call me back within the day to let me know the status, but no call. I called back by the end of the day to confirm this appt again, and was told they contacted this leasing agent (Ashley)but she never responded to them.. they then said for me to go on up to the home the following day for our scheduled appt. Feb 1st (today). Waited their, no show.. (oh I took a half day from work too ).Called the company again, explained my issue. Was on hold for eleven minutes.  Hung up😕 and called back. Come to find out, they approved that application for that person who applied, and the home has been ready for a walk through all damn week.. smh.. I will NEVER do business with these run arounders! And the leasing agent Ashley.... beware of her professionalism,  because it is definitely lacking. Good look Tricon<//text>

<Review>I live in Charlotte and rent a home with Tricon Homes. I fell into some financial problems and was very behind with a payment. The worst thing you can have in these times is people harrassing you. Their staff (specifically a lady called Noka?) were nothing but...well human beings. I was treated with respect and was explained all my options. She told me not to be scared that it happened to the best of us, lol. I truly do appreciate that bc I dint know the process and was scared for me and family. Thank you again for treating me like a person.

<text>My initial experience wasn't as expected, however I was routed to Tracy who might I add was very thorough, professional and sympathetic to our needs. She immediately resolved all of our issues. Not only did she find a home minutes away from our jobs but Tracy got a another realtor Eisha involved who took time out of her schedule to show us the home the very next day. I loved that Tracy and Eisha were so informative and handled our situation in urgency. I would recommend Tricon to anyone looking for a home. Thank you all so very much for helping us in such a caring way!!! GO WITH TRICON!!!< /text>< pics>

I cant wait until my family and friends decide to move here from New York LOL, they won't be renting from any other agency. Most of my personal experiences have been with Michelle Maldonado in the Phoenix office. I've never met this lady face to face but feel as if I've known her forever. Because my LO is battling cancer I've had some personal issue's come up..each time she's givin me excellent customer service and has treated me with up most respect. There's been times I've just needed to ramble via e-mail and her responses are always uplifting. This will be my 4th year with the agency and so far I've only had two maintenance issues and both times they were prompt with call backs, jobs were finished same day and the maintenance guys were very respectful of my home and privacy and very curious to my family. If you re thinking of relocating or just need a change in agency's CHOOSE TRICON AMERICAN HOME'S !! You will not be disappointed.</review>< response>

< review>
I was recently interested in renting a home from Tricon in the ATL area. I requested a showing online twice and received no response. I called twice. The first time my request was never put in. The second time I was finally able to schedule a showing. I took off work early to go to the showing. I waited 5 mins and the agent hadn't shown up or called. I called and was put on hold for over 10 mins. No one ever came back on the line. I was just randomly transferred to someone's voicemail. I called back and was finally told the the property had been rented over the weekend. I do not appreciate my time being wasted. This is very poor unprofessional customer service. Due to this experience I will not be attempting to rent from them in the future.</review>

<date>1488580178359< /date><rating>2</rating><text>Must be dependent on where you live, and with whom you deal with within customer support.  I agree as far as I don't know how they stay in business if the rest of the company in other areas functions like this.  Since day 1 of being here 3 years it has been the 2nd worst rental experience as far as initial contract being incorrect, rental amounts being incorrect upon renewal of lease or even after signing receiving notification that you're up for renewal, receiving notifications of non payment on the day in which your payment clears prior to the 5th day of the month.  This has happened or been on going for the past 3 years.  They are mostly okay as far as maintenance request, but that's pending if you can get anyone to answer.  Best way is just to log the issue online.  Still might take 48hrs to 2 mos  before anyone will get back with you no matter how often you call, email, etc.  Why am I still here...  A. Moving is a pain, and B. I do love the house, and the area but beginning to think it's not worth it.  This house will definitely rent fast because of the area.  So I guess the attitude is they don't have to provide excellent nor efficient  customer service for this state/city because of the demand.  Current issue is that they attempted to repair the ceiling, and repaint x 3.  This was the 4th leak in a different area.  If the maintenance person confesses to not being experienced with what they are doing BELIEVE THEM!  The paint is uneven, Lots of missed areas, and there is an indention where the hole was.  As long as guest don't look up, I guess I'll be okay.  However, them going up 3-7% on rent each year you would think they would correct.  They are definitely getting a great return as far as investment.  Good luck, and hopefully your experience will be far more better than mine!< /text>< pics>

IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD. THIS COMPANY HAS ME LIVING IN A TOXIC ENVIRONMENT AND WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT IT!

MOLD IS A PROBLEM IT IS AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF THE OCCUPANTS AND THEY WILL DO NOTHING.

My guess is the reviews here are paid for by the company.
Look on YELP to see the truth!</Review>

<text>I moved into my rental property in Phoenix, Az May 2015 with Silverbay Management as my leasing company. I had no problems with Silverbay. I have always paid my rent on time and take pride in the home I rent as though I own it. The customer service was great, they were easy to get in touch with. However, in 2017 Tricon homes took over property management. All calls are routed through a third party company who is contracted with Tricon. What this means is all calls are routed to the office and almost 95% of the time you have to leave a message. Michelle M from the billing, payment office is Horrible about returning calls. So you have to call and call and call. Most of the time I try to contact her supervisor as she was employed with Silverbay prior to the takeover, although she is better but not best at taking calls. I have had issues ranging from paying my rent 2 months ahead to having it Not noted on my account. This month they want to charge me late fees when I paid my rent in the office on the 3rd and its not late until after the 5th. The customer routing service told me that Michelle stated the payment had to be sent to another office and they got it after the 7th. What?! I am not understanding what that has to do with me. I paid my rent on time. They still have yet to return my call.

UPDATE 11/2017: After posting my review Tricon management has personally contacted me to ensure my account was credited the late fee. Mona Lisa gave me her personal number ensuring I could contact her with any issues. I appreciate their steps in trying to be better at customer service. I'll keep this post updated as time goes on.</text><UserId.>103317472527439287652<//UserId.>< Rate>

<Review>Wish I could give 0 stars . It's now the 16 of October. I had a broken window in the front of my house since hurricane irma. And no one can tell me anything.i call and they tell me they have sub contracted it out and gave me numbers to call. When I call it's somebodys  uncles sisters stepdads little brother. Chewing food when they answered the phone with a hello? Like they were suprised the phone rang. Area supervisor doesn't call and say hey we have your work order  and we are going to get it done as  fast as we can. We get nothing. If u have home repairs u might as well buy your own house because u have to fix everything yourself anyways . I recommend never renting through these people . I wasn't going to pay rent untill my window was fixed. But I sat and watch a guy come to my door sneaking to put a notice on my door. About paying rent. So they can send someone to put a notice on my door but can't send someone to fix my damn window. Can't wait till my lease is up . I'm leaving treadmarks out the driveway<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I have never had an issue with Tricon American Homes until today. I live in one of their properties in Tampa Bay and called their office to inquire about their maintenance team possibly boarding up my windows with plywood before we are hit by hurricane Irma which is now a category 5 storm. I was informed that the higher-ups had decided that they were not going to take ANY preventive measures for any of their houses that are in the path of the hurricane. If I wanted to protect THEIR house's windows, I would have to pay for it out of pocket as well as patch the holes in the concrete from the drills. On the brightside, however, they did inform me that any damage caused by the storm, such as broken windows, would be fixed by them. This logic makes absolutely no sense and only a bad company would purposely choose not to protect their investements, i.e. the houses they own and rent! While I love the house I am renting from them, I am extremely disappointed in how they are handling this emergency and hope that their numerous other tennants in the Tampa Bay area do not sustain any injuries due to Tricon's negligence.< /text>

When Silver Bay homes on the property we had no issue at all putting in maintenance request and having it fixed in a timely manner now that tricon American Homes owns the property we have had an ongoing list of issues that they refused to address we had our roof replaced a while back when Hurricane Matthew came through and everything was fine it about 3 weeks ago it's from a small leak we addressed this issue immediately with tricon American homes and they said they would have somebody out the next day well the next day came around and no one showed up now this small leak in our ceiling has turned into a major leak and is causing structural and sheetrock damage to the ceiling and light fixtures which is leaking out of I have called their maintenance department multiple times on a daily basis since this issue has occurred and they assured me that it was escalated to a emergency priority and that somebody would be here right away well still been 2 weeks and no one showed up and it's getting worse and worse word to the wise do not rent any properties from these people because nothing will be fixed and then you're going to get stuck with the bill when you move out my advice to you document and take pictures of everything that happens to your property and worst case scenario get a lawyer involved,

(Update 9/29/17)

After a long conversation with their new maintenance manager, I'm am glad to say they really went out of their way to help us out. We got our full deposits back and all the damages caused by the unfixed issues were not held against us. Their new maintenance manager is great at his job and will do what ever he can to help you out. Im glad they hired some one on who can actually do their job, and do it in a timely manner.<//Text>

Don’t even bother with this company. First of all it is hard to get an appointment to view a house because I could never get a time after 5 during the week. I also work on Saturdays and ended up scheduling an appointment for a Saturday morning and was going to go into work late. The week of the scheduled appointment the showing agent texted me to reschedule for some time during that week and after stating my time availabities I got no response.< /text>

Thank you so much Carmen. I really appreciate it. Its a pleasure to work with professionals like yourself. Thank you kindly for the extra effort.. its refreshing to know some companies still value customer service.

Also i will say that Brian Holz the realtor on this deal and the last Tricon deal i did has been very easy to work with. He even met me at 10 am on a sunday to get paperwork. As a Broker and owner I'm am always looking to work with realtors and companies that know how to get a deal done and arent afraid of a little hard work or extra effort to make a deal happen.

I also spoke to Rachael who by the way is one of the most polite and respectful people I've heard on the phone in a long time. I really appreciate her efforts and patient demeanor.

You have a good team, your service is great!< /text>

I have nothing but good things to say about this company - I live in Florida and my home is in North Lauderdale - I have a 3/2 home and have needed some repairs. Roof Leak - the whole roof was changed, AC wasn't working - I got a new one. Let me tell YOU... these people NEVER hesitated on my repairs. Every time I needed something  the response was immediate. As far as my portfolio manager Wendy Fabel - she is excellent. If I had any questions or  repair problems she always responded to either my emails or phone calls in a prompt manner. She has always been courteous - I would give Tricon Homes and Wendy Fabel 10 starts if it was available. I highly recommend to anyone - if you are looking on renting a home carefree - go with Tricon Homes.<//text>

***update *****

I have been here about a month and a half. Tricon has worked with me and is addressing the pest problem, fixed my ac, and resealed my doors. The maintenance men have been prompt, polite, and on time. I am happy in my home and glad I moved in now.

*******
I just moved in on the 21st. There is a horrible german roach infestation. I contacted tricon on Monday, tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday before someone agreed to come out today. After speaking with the pest control company tricon contracted, he said that tricon was aware of the German roach infestation before I moved in and that it had never gotten treated because it slipped through the cracks. Now I have to pull out all of my stuff from the cabinets that I've moved in so that they can come out and lay something down. This is ridiculous and this is uninhabitable conditions. I'm extremely disgusted and  disappointed that I moved into the house that they  knew to have a German roach infestation. Had I known that I would not have moved in. This information was not given to me beforehand. I had the joy of discovering it after moving myself and my 2 small children in.</Review>

We had the dryrotted repaired finally so rain doesnt come in.
Hiwever all the carpet is coming up do to de-lamination and today a carpet company came and put METAL transitions on carpet through the house with giant screws that will cut our feet if we accidently step on them.  I'll have to lay towels over them for now.  I tried to reach out to the company and Tricon, they were closed and Tricon says my password that Ive used for 3 years isnt valid.
I need to contact Tricon about the "repairs" that were done Monday 7/16/18 & today please.
Update 5/8/18
our dues were paid.
Our toilet still smells like rotten eggs and our windows are still a problem.  No one is ever on the same page and Ms. Janet Cho hasnt responded to me in weeks.
Our rent has increased over 125.00 and we are probably paying 8 to900 over mortgage price a month for this house.  This will probably be the last year we stay here.  You have to beg and call almost everyday for simple things that they tell you to call for so you won't get stuck paying for when you move out.
At this point I am going to have to just finally look at purchasing a home in the area.  Renting is great.  I would recommend it from an individual that care kf yoy stay or go.  This is just a corporation that sees you as expendable.  The call number I am given is in California and they are not sympathetic to anything you say, I have been blamed for not being available etc.  I stay home everday.  I am always reachable.
I've had 5 people come take pictures of the cracking walls and leaking windows and dryrotted wood where bugs are coming in.  Finally after 6 months someone came and caulked the separated ceiling from the room.  Thats it.
Just remember this is a corporation and they only care about you paying rent, sorry to say.

We just learned a few weeks ago that Tricon hasn't been paying our HOA dues.  So we haven't been able to enjoy any of the amenities in the neighborhood.  I spoke with the head of the HOA business at Tricon who assured me this would be taken care of immediately.  We weren't even marked down as living in an HOA she said.  We have been here since 5/16.
The HOA didn't even let us know, I haven't a clue why.  However, I keep calling and just rings, then I hit the correct prompt #5, and get placed on hold for over 12 min.  Now on hold again.

5/25/17
Happy to report all our needs were met.  We look forward to more things being fixed in the home.  It seems the transition was effecting more residents then just me.  I am very grateful for Tracy and the support and professionalism she has shown us.
Very sincerely,
Tiffany

Update, no one called us back this morning, so I called again.  Gave me a new password.
Haven't tried it yet.

Call begins
Your stove should be being delivered from Lowe's.  They'll be calling you.

Okay thanks.

We'll wait just the oven part doesn't work right?

That's correct.

Okay, well I'll send someone out today to repair it.

You'll expect a call soon ma'am. Ok, ok, hello ma'am.
End call.

So you didn't order one it's been over a week and now it'll be longer because someone's going to "fix" it
〰️updated 5/22/17

Just signed a new 2 year lease with silver bay, but then tricon became the management.  I have been without an oven for a weeks now, with no response but a very nice man taking a picture of it.  Finally got someone to answer the phone Friday after calling and leaving messages all week.  She said oh wrong department we'll have them contact you.  So still no one contacted us.
Now none of our logins work, says our email cannot be verified, and to call property management.   Well I need to pay rent and can't.   I've never ever been late ever and I dont want to be now.  I'd like a phone call to remedy this quickly.< /text>

Very disappointed in Tricon American Homes. Tricon bought out Silverbay Property 2 months ago. I have been renting from Silverbay for 1.5 years in the same residential property and signed another 2 year lease back in December 2016. I have used the website to pay rent faithfully for 1.5 years. I've never been late. Never had any issues.
2nd month in with Tricon, unaware that the website did not process my payment correctly, I called to find out why the balance was still in my bank account, they informed me that the payment did not post and I was in default. I now have a 50.00 late fee and possible eviction if I do not post payment today.

Now, I completely understand if this was negligence on my part, however, I had a confirmation page. I do recall however that I did not receive a confirmation email (bad on my part that I did not realize this until today).

They wouldn't even work with me. Not even paying rent today and the late fee on Friday...nope. it had to post today to avoid pay or quit notice which is another  $40.00 fee. Unbelievable!. We will no longer put any extra money into this home and will not be renewing our lease next December.

Tricon.....you have horrible customer service. A little empathy and understanding with your good standing tenants is not alot to ask. We love this house and were very happy with Silverbay..... you have now lost a long term resident.

Update......
Thank you Mona Lisa for contacting me and correcting this situation.<//Text>

That didn't last long. The settlement that we agreed to said we would move out at the end of our lease. After being turned down for a rental because they were unable to get a verification back from Tricon and my mother on hospice taking a turn for the worse we asked them if we could just renew our lease or pay whatever fees were required to stay longer. They refused. I attempted to contact Alan Obrien who not only refused to help but it seems he was not too pleased with having to not actually take responsibility for what they apparently didn't do. In fact they have again sent me another 30 day notice and mind you the fence still hasn't even been properly fixed.
Looking at some recent reviews it seems like I am not the only one having these kinds of issues. I also noticed a lot of responses on all the wonderful reviews. Too bad they don't pay as much attention to their customers needs as they do their reviews....

New update!! I was contacted by the senior portfolio manager for our area. After consideration for the best possible outcome I agreed to a settlement with Tricon. While I feel that they are not outright accepting responsibility I do feel that they have made an effort to correct the situation. With rapid expansion there will always be something that slips through the cracks. I am hoping that this will be an eye opener for them and that the necessary changes will be made. I would also like to personally thank Heather and Marlena for being able to change my opinion of this company. Their time and effort have been truly appreciated. While I can't give them a 5 star rating just yet I would definitely consider them in the future.

Update!! I guess this is how they handle their problem tenants. We received a 60 day notice today to vacate. Signed by the same Claudia Moya who lied in an email that she sent to me saying that this was the first time she had heard about the fence being an ongoing problem even though she was responding to an email from a month previous where she acknowledged the problem.

Unfortunately it has come to making publicly known the amount of drama we have had to endure at the hands of this company. We have been in our current residence for going on 4 years. Our fenice which was not properly installed had deteriorated over the years. We had tried to advise them on several occasions what needed to be done. They however have chosen to patch work the job to the tune of probably close to a dozen visits by 4 different companies. This past winter we were without protection from the coyotes that roam the desert behind our house or the neighbors dog who eventually got in our yard and attacked our dog in front of my 10year old son. Now last year when the option to renew our lease came about that along with our change in financial situation became a huge concern. We had been consistently late and getting hit with 5 day notices to pay or quit by the 6th of each month. They refused to make a payment arrangement and said it was company policy to refer it to an attorney. I explained that our situation had changed and addressed the fact that we would be consistently 5 business days after the 1st and asked if we would be able to have a grace period or if we should move then. We were assured that the fence would be fixed and that the 5 days would not be a problem but they could not put that in our lease. With my experience I should have known better. Of course the first month that we paid late we received a 5 day notice to pay or quit. I've lost count of how many over the years. In all my years of collection experience and Property Management I have never heard of a company not accepting a payment arrangement. I thought that's why they had late fees? We have not been perfect renters but we have tried. We have never broken a promise to them or not taken care of our home. In any case my advice would be to not rent a property if you see the title tricon American Homes attached to it.< /Text>

<Review>I rented a property from Tricon American Homes in Riverside County, CA. I never had issues when it came to repairs. HOWEVER, anytime I had to deal with Retention Specialists (Marlena Buksh, Marlena Sanchez), Portfolio Manager (Claudia Moya), and Assistant Portfolio Manager (Marisa Markham) I had problems. Mainly it was communication problems. Ms. Sanchez and Buksh responded weeks, if not a month after I called and left messages and sent several emails. Ms. Markham I emailed on February 21st, 2017, and she has yet to contact me. My BIGGEST issue is that I moved out of my rental January 31st and have yet to receive my security deposit from Tricon. I made every payment on time and in full for 3 years and 7 months. I left the property cleaner than I received. As a matter of fact a new tenant application was accepted 3 days after I turned in keys because I left them a property that was move in ready. I have left messages and sent emails to get my security deposit back, but am getting nowhere with Tricon. Ms. Moya, who writes these checks is unreachable. Ms. Moya is now 4 weeks late in giving me my security deposit or any accounting for that money. I contacted Tricon to get a mailing address for Ms. Moya and got the address 1508 Brookhollow Drive, Santa Ana, CA 92705. I went to the post office and was told I need a suite number. Please make sure to ask for it if you need it, since Jennifer, from Tricon American Homes customer service neglected to provide me with that information. I have mailed Ms. Moya a letter demanding my security deposit. In all honesty I would avoid any property managed by Tricon American Homes for their lack of communication and integrity.< /Review>< rating>

Our kitchen sprayer broke which should be a simple fix, now after waiting almost 2 weeks to get it fixed, it has half the pressure and squeals loudly when used. Still waiting to hear back about getting it fixed after calling in 2 work orders on it. Our air conditioner broke as well, and it was "fixed" 2 weeks ago and is broken again already. I have been trying to get ahold of someone that can help for almost 9 hours. I was finally able to track down the vendor who never recieved the work order even though tricon claims to have sent it twice. Rude customer service with a "sorry nothing I can do about it, it's not my job" attitude. Do not rent from these people!!<//review>< pics>

Stay away. Waste of time. I pre qualified with a credit score well over the minimum requirements. My income is over double the minimum requirements. No evictions. No criminal history. Yet, got denied? Their screening system is obviously flawed. They treat you like a number, not an individual. Have never had a problem anywhere with getting approved to rent. Got approval for another place in less than a day after the stole my 45 dollar application fee. Honestly, I believe the whole pre qualify thing is a scam. I would almost bet a big chunk of their revenue comes from telling people the pre qualify and then take ther $45 application fee. They probably have a quota for each property to make a certain amount on application fees before approving some poor schmuck. Hey TRICON....F U!!!</Review>

At this time, we offer a prequalification option in the Las Vegas market only.  The primary objective of our prequalification service is to identify severely adverse items in an effort to prequalify all those interested in our rental homes without hurting their credit. Without sharing too many details of your confidential information through an open source, you were indeed prequalified based upon not having certain adverse items during the prequalification stage.  Some of the items considered during prequalification are previous evictions, landlord debts, utility delinquencies, FICO Scores and rent to income ratios. However, prequalification is not our final applicant screening. Our final rental applicant screening process is a comprehensive review into an applicant’s background including civil court history, level of collections, length of rental history and late payments.

<rate>1<//rate><Review>This company is a complete joke! From the lengthy maintenance processes, to the lack of communication and un professionalism. I really don't see how this place is still in business. I have been a resident with tricon for 2 years now (My property was sold to them) from original company. Since changing to tricon I have had more inspections than when I was in the military. The icing on the cake was today, when my door bell starts ringing at 9:08 am which is the 17th of August, ( I already have a confirmed appt for the 19th). I go to the door and 6 ppl are standing there saying that they are with tricon American homes. After a brief back and forth about the mix up on their part, they proceed to enter my home and take photos of MY belonging. One of the ladies asked about the hvac system and appliances which can be accessed from outside (hvac) and all appliances are down stairs. It started to make me irritated when they started to proceed upstairs and sneakily take photos of my bedroom. There was an actual confrontation between the staff when I told them that my son was asleep in a room and one of them still insisted that they go in and one of them didn't agree. They still opened the door to sneakily take a quick photo inside. Like I said I have been a resident for 2 years now. Not by choice. but I know for sure what happened here today was a violation of my privacy and some plain old B.S... I have since spoken with the corporate office and they blame the encounter on a third party insurance source, and claimed that they were not aware of the situation. But it is a "hell of a" coincidence that someone from our local tricon office called me while I was on the phone with the corporate office, to "warn me that the inspections were gonna be done early". Yea right!!! Nice try on you part to cover your ass, but that was a " day late, and a dollar short". If you can avoid renting through tricon, I would. You can read other reviews, not just mine and make your own decision. But be prepared to deal with them.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>The maintenence side of Tricon is terrible, at least for my property. It took them 6 months of me calling to have them install rain gutters, which they agreed should have already been on.
A leaking pipe in my attic was fixed by a guy that does small pressure washing jobs and asked to borrow a pipe wrench.
It took almost a month to fix a leak in my living room that sat for days before the carpet was replaced with a random new color. I kept calling and emailing them my concern about mold, but they kept brushing it off saying it isn't mold, or just denying the contractors request to test for it.
I requested someone look at the house to see my concerns I've been noticing. They sent a contractor out who wrote it all down and took pictures, saying he will take care of everything. After 2 weeks with no contact from anyone, I had to call Tricon. They didn't know if the order was assigned to anyone, or if anyone had even come out to the house yet. The next day I was called by a new contractor who repeated the same process with no contact after 2 weeks. The 3rd time, they sent the Tricon superintendent. He tells me they can't or won't spend the money to fix most of my concerns.  My master closet is so humid, one of those damp rid bags hanging fills up completely in about 7-9 days.  He said the gap under the door was correct and they wouldn't spend the money to add a small AC vent for airflow.  He suggested putting a fan in front of the open closet door. He said the moisture could be from the AC pick up vent being dirty, and that we should change the filter out each month. Then he said they actually recommend using the cheaper air filters, and not to buy the better ones because the cheaper ones allow more airflow, which in turn would actually help cool the house faster. We have a dog so we change the filter out almost twice a month with quality filters. The day after he came out, I decided to take down all of the air vents because there was green mold on them, which the guy also attributed slightly to the filter thing.  The inside of every vent in the house had large amounts of green and white mold growing.  I sent him the pictures and he assured me the contractor coming to fix the other things specializes in "discoloration" and that he would take care of all "discoloration" and make sure there are no other signs of "discoloration" and that there were no other safety issues.  He pushed the word "discoloration" a lot.  I've found Tricon will do it's best to not acknowledge the word mold.  It's been 11 days since I received the response about the mold, and I still haven't heard anything from anyone.  I complained about all of these issues to the person that sent me my lease renewal last month, and she said she would notify someone of my concerns and touch base with me the next day.  I never heard back from her either.  I haven't been able to get in touch with any type of management.  My maintenence coordinator, Yolanda Zamzam, has been impossible to contact from the beginning.  She doesn't answer her direct number, other staff on the phone can't reach her, and I have specifically requested that she contact me just to let me know what's going on over 10 times.  Not once has she contacted me.  She emailed me once to say my work order has been assigned.  I replied and let her know how frustrating it's been not knowing what's going on, and having random contractors call me to come look at what 3 other people already have. I told her that I'm not on my email a lot and it would be much better if she could call me directly next time.  I received an email a few days later saying someone will contact me to come look at my problems. I've also stop taking off time from work for their appointments, because the first 3 days I did that, no one showed up, or they arrived around 3pm instead of 8am as promised.</review>< rating>

<time>1499296133879<//time><rating>1< /rating><Review>It has been an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE since Tricon took over Silverbay. The maintenance response has been UTTERLY EMBARRASSING. In June, our A/C went out in the middle of the day on a Saturday. I immediately called and made a maintenance request. I was told they would contact a vendor and someone would be out as soon as possible. Several hours later, Tricon called back and said they couldn't find someone to come out because they couldn't find a vendor that services my area, but someone would definitely be to the house on Sunday. I ended up having to put my large family in a hotel room for the night. Sunday came and went. I talked to Tricon multiple times and all they ever said was that they could not find a vendor that services my area. My family again had to stay in a hotel room. Tricon said someone would definitely be out to the house on Monday. Monday afternoon came and Tricon still had not found a vendor. After multiple phone calls and raising enough fuss, I finally got to speak to someone in my "local" Tricon office. Tracy Downing (portfolio manager) assured me that someone would be out. I finally got tired of waiting and my family needed to be able to go back home. So I called my own repair guy. He was there within 2 hours. And he had the problem fixed in under an hour.
I called Tricon and explained that it cost a lot of money to put my family in a hotel room and I had to pay out of pocket for the A/C repair. Tracy Downing emailed me and me to send her my hotel bill and repair bill and she would submit it for approval for reimbursement. After another week of calling and emailing with no response, she finally responded that Tricon would reimburse me for the repair, but only $90 a day for the hotel! Tricon expects a large family to be able to stay in a hotel for only $90 a day?! I explained to her that she never mentioned a limit for reimbursement and that this was unacceptable. She told me she would get in touch with her boss. It's been several days since I've heard from her now. Its ridiculous that this company expects a family to pay out of pocket to stay at a hotel for more than $90 a day.
Last week, we went through the same type of issue with a busted water pipe in the front yard. It burst in the middle of the day on a week day. We immediately reported it, but Tricon claimed they couldn't find a vendor that services my area. It took them a day and a half to get someone to come repair it.
How are you a national rental company, but you can't find vendors that service areas where you own property?
Lately, I have tried to call two different people in my local Tricon office: Tracy Downing and Abby Boorstin. Neither one of them ever answer their phone or return phone calls. This is pathetic customer service. I will not be renewing my lease at the end of this term and if I could find a way to get out of the lease I have now without paying an absurdly high penalty, I would.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This company purchased Silverbay and the communication was horrible.  I was in my home during the heat of the summer for 5 weeks with NO AC!!! They kept giving me the run around, not empathetic at all... Most nights it was 85 degrees in my home at 3am. We were miserable and they were in no rush to repair it.<//Review>

We can appreciate your desire to complete the application process rapidly and move into your new home.  In your case, the application to move-in occurred within 13 days.  As you discussed with our property manager in the Tampa region, when applying for a home with roommates, everyone on the lease needs to complete the application prior to our credit analysts processing it.  Additionally, some applications require review and approval from our senior leadership and in your case, unfortunately, took longer than anticipated.  We have reviewed our internal processes and have made changes to improve this experience for future customers.  Thank you for allowing us to serve you.'}</Resp>

Tech Ernie Morales was more than a pleasure to work with.  He fully evaluated the situation and didn't leave before explaining what happened to our AC unit. This wasn't my first experience with him and from now on I'll be sure to request Ernie for any other issues that may come up!

Thank you!<//Review>

I would like to send a big big shout out to Gary out in Dallas. I just moved in my new rental home on Monday. The grass had not been mowed for weeks and I am having a COVID Vaccination party and Gary sent Jesse and Fernando to my rescue thanks for saving the day for me. To all who was involved with this matter your team "ROCKS"!!!<//Review>

My husband and I rented our first home through Tricon. Belincia Weatherby helped us through the whole process and was absolutely phenomenal. She was very responsive and patient with my many questions. She was respectful of my working times regarding communication. She was so positive and polite throughout the entire process and made the transition seamless!<//review>

{'time': 1620147906980, 'text': 'Heather Alonzo, we are sorry to see that you are not satisfied with Tricon Residential. In order to treat everyone equitably and stay in compliance with Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity laws, we utilize a third-party credit rating agency which objectively qualifies all applicants to rent our homes. Each applicant’s privacy and personal information is completely confidential.  As part of this confidentiality, we would never discuss contributing factors to our decision on such a public forum such as this.  However, as stated in our terms of agreement that was signed when submitting the application, the items considered for rental qualifications include previous evictions, bankruptcy, landlord debts, utility delinquencies, FICO score, rent-to-income ratio, civil court history, level of collections, charge-offs length of rental history, and late payments. While you did not meet our rental qualifications, we thank you for considering Tricon Residential in your rental search. Thank you.'}< /Response>

At Tricon American Homes, our purpose statement is "To go above and beyond, with our time, care and service, so that lives and communities are enriched". It saddens us to hear that we failed to live up to our purpose statement in this case. Would you please provide us one final opportunity to resolve the issue causing frustration with us? If you would like to resolve your issue, please email us directly at TAHExecutive@TriconAH.com.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In regard to your review, upon submission of the rental application, you agreed to the Company’s Terms of Agreement as well as paid a $45 non-refundable application fee per applicant and a $250 non-refundable holding deposit.  Our non-refundable holding deposit is in place as a formal expression of intent to acknowledge the prospective resident’s hold on a home while the application is processed. Due to the home being pulled off the market, and no longer being available to other prospective residents, the holding fee is a gesture of good will between the interested prospective resident and Tricon American Homes.  In accordance with our Terms of Agreement, and in observance of Fair Housing, we universally apply the same standards to all our perspective residents.  Mr. Kwezi, we do thank you for taking the time to bring your experience to our attention.'}</response>
