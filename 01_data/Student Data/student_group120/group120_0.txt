I rarely post reviews for products online as I'm seldom impressed with a product enough to do so.  However, in this instance I feel compelled to shout this one from the rooftops!  I am the full time caregiver for my 64 spouse who I've been married to for 46 years.  She has Type II diabetes among other serious maladies, but her blood sugar drops dangerously low without warning, often in her sleep.  With the new Libre II device monitoring her levels in real time and sounding the alarm, we are able to promptly react before she goes into hypoglycemic shock.  Just as amazing is the predictive nature of the device that forecasts rising or falling trends of her lab values thus allowing us to adjust diet and other factors resulting using less insulin.  It is a game changer for us!  Finally, we are so grateful to Advanced Diabetes Supply for guiding us through the process of obtaining the device, coordinating medical records, insurance company requirements and keeping us posted every step of the way!  We dealt with a person by the name of Izzy who was professional, compassionate and kind. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  Please feel free to use any or all of this review.

ADS has been very helpful to me.  They call when info is needed to continue the service of my sensors, and help to make my experience with them very easy. Thank you ADS</Text>

Great place to get help with the incredibly high price of insulin and products for people with type 2 diabetes.  Helpful and kind staff they work with you to help get the things that you need. I recommended them to my mother in law. There are no hoops or gimmicks everything is very straightforward!! Thank you Advanced Diabetes Supply for helping my husband who is on disability when Medicare would not!!<//Text>

Dealing with this company has been one of the best experiences I’ve had they are very helpful and if one person doesn’t have the answer they find it for you or transfer my call to the right person.

My husbands prescription for a sensor did not get filled on time so I called Advanced Diabetes Supply to find out why.   The Dr 's office never faxed it in.   The Rep was so friendly and helpful.   She had one sent to us overnight delivery.   Thank You   You are the best< /Text>

<Text>Service has been excellent.  The phone people are responsive and do what they promise to do. I’ve been using them for nearly a year, and on only one occasion, was there a delay in getting back to me.  They answer all of my questions and never make me feel that I am bothering them, even if sometimes I am sure I must be.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

Absolutely terrible service. Not only is the phone wait time incredibly long, their suggested use of their voicemail takes no less than 24 hours and usually longer to get back to you.
I have been having an issue with my transmitter that (for some reason) was not sent with my sensor supplies. After 7 phone calls (and counting), I have still not received it. At each phone call, one issue is apparently addressed, but other issues are not. Then, I as the customer, have to continuously follow up to find out why I still haven't received my transmitter. Then another issue comes up that has to be addressed. Today my transmitter finally died so I'm back to finger sticks. I have been "guaranteed" that it was going to arrive several days ago, but still no transmitter. As a physician, my staff and I deal with various medical and medical supply companies, Advanced Diabetes Supply has been the worst experience I've had in 30+ years of practicing medicine. I spoke with my endocrinologist and she has stated that several of her other patients are having similar issues.< /Review>

{'time': 1622129908970, 'text': 'Greetings Pablo –\n\nFirstly, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with our service. We appreciate your feedback and we investigate every review thoroughly to enhance our customer service to meet our patient’s needs.\n\nFor your initial order with us on 04/09/21, we received a transferred prescription. Our representative confirmed your order to be shipped which you authorized only sensors to be sent because you did not need a receiver or transmitter at that time. On 05/05/21, you contacted us to ship a transmitter however the transferred prescription we received for your initial order had just expired.  We reached out to your provider to obtain a valid prescription and confirmed your order. Unfortunately, we made an error with calculating your copay causing a delay with your transmitter order.  Upon identifying our error, we expedited your order to ship next day and tracking confirms your order was delivered yesterday.\n\nYour next eligible order for sensors will be available on 07/08/21 and your transmitter order will be available on 11/22/21.  We are actively seeking to grow our staff to better assist with connecting to our patients quicker over the phone.  You may also email us at customercare@northcoastmed.com and we can reach back out to you after reviewing your account.  Again, we sincerely apologize for the delay and appreciate you choosing ADS for your testing needs.\n\nPlease reach out should you require anything additional.'}<//Response>

<Text>Since using the Freestyle Libre 2 from ADS, it has changed my blood sugar ups and downs. Went from 7.6 to 6.5. Can see where I am at at anytime and can adjust. ADS has made it super easy to get my supplies, and reordering is a breeze! So glad I am able to work with them.</Text>< Pictures>

When I couldn’t get my Free Libre supplies for a reasonable price , I searched the website (Free Libre) , and was directed to Advanced Diabetic. This source has been wonderful. Although I live across the country, they’ve sent my supplies on time every time... without my prompting. The savings in cost are the best! No complaints here!<//Text>

<text>I have only been with Advanced for approx. two (2) months and have received one (1) shipment of sensors, etc.---basically the starter kit.  I have also spoken to the pharmacist a few times and had a good experience with her; she seemed informed and knowledgeable. So, thus far, things have been copasetic and they aim to please.  One thing I must say is that the company should NOT outsource their phone-calls to places where English is not the primary language; it makes them harder to understand and which causes confusion and  lots of: "Can you repeat that please"  in a conversation.   Thank You,  Rev. Fr. Leonard Stark, ORC</text>< Pictures>

I started using ADS for my Libre sensors about 4 years ago. The first sensors were 10 day sensors at first, and now they are 14 day sensors, and better now the sensor Reader will alert one to either low or high glucose day or nite!
The service provided by Advanced Diabetes Supply has been great all of these 4 years! They have been there for me whenever I have need them. I would refer them to anyone along with the Libre sensors!</Text>

I have written 0 reviews ever. This company is horrible.

Dexcom recently switched their resupply provider over to this company. It has taken over two months for me to receive my products, and I am still waiting!!! They don't pick up phone calls, they don't return calls, they don't send out follow up emails.

If you are presented with the opportunity to work with ADS, say no and ask for an alternative.< /Text>

I have been trying to get in contact with this supplier for over a week now.  On hold for over 20 minutes, then they NEVER call back when you request the call back.  I was completely out of my sensors and again no call backs after 7-8 phone calls.  This is a HORRIBLE, unreliable supply company.  I would tell anyone that is considering using this company, STAY AWAY!  It is not like our supplies are optional, they are the difference between life and death.  I  have now switched back to Byram!  I will be contacting Dexcom & Tandem to let them know the kind of suppliers they are referring their patients to!<//review>

I can't even begin to express my frustration at the incompetence of ADS. Case in point: In January 2021, I called them to update our new insurance. Diabetes supplies were not due to be refilled until March, so this gave them plenty of time.

On March 2, 2021, they sent their form text asking for authorization to ship and charge the card on file. I authorized it.

On March 12, 2021, I received an email from ADS, asking for the exact same authorization. I gave it, and asked why they were emailing when they texted for the same authorization ten days earlier.

On March 23, 2021, I called ADS to find out what was going on, because supplies were about to run out. I had to wait on hold for over TWO HOURS before I finally got to speak to someone, and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with the order.

On March 24, 2021, they called me on the phone to say that they had run the insurance verification TO THE WRONG INSURANCE. Yes, they had the correct insurance on file from when I updated it back in January, but they didn't use that one; they used the previous insurance. So now they had to run a NEW insurance verification. They assured me they'd put a rush order on it, so it should be back within a couple of days. I gave my authorization at that time for them to immediately ship it, once the verification was back.

On April 15, 2021, they called me to say that the insurance verification JUST came back (???) but wouldn't authorize a 90-day supply, which we've had for over a year. They didn't offer to send one month's supply. They didn't offer anything. Just a phone number if I wanted to call them back.

I called back, waited on hold several minutes, and left a voice message. With their track record, it could be days or weeks before I hear from them again, and meanwhile diabetes supplies have run out.< /Text>

Very poor service. It takes forever to reach someone on the phone; they say they will call back and never do.  The personnel are very  pleasant when you speak with them but there is a huge disconnect then between ordering and receiving supplies at ADS. Seems like they need a total reorganization to gain some efficiency when they are dealing with such essential products< /review>

Once you are able to reach someone on the phone they tend to do great. But it can take several hours to get someone. I've been waiting since 8:00am.... it's 10:13am right now.< /text>

<Review>I wish I could give negative stars because this is the worst place I have dealt with in ordering diabetic supplies. First off it took an entire month to receive my Dexcom G6 order, 2 weeks into that when I called them to see what's going on, they claimed they were waiting on my medical records, even though they never said they needed them. Took another 2 weeks before they finally processed the order. They told me I would get a 3 month supply of sensors, and even said the dollar amount it would be, but when it shipped the invoice only had one box of sensors (one month) and I was only charged for a one month supply. When I called them again they said there was an error on their end with the order, but they wouldn't let me get the other two months until the first month ran out, and they would contact me at the end of the first month. Of course the month came and went and heard crickets from them. When I called them about the next order they said it would be at least another 10 day wait before they could fill again, even though I was already out of sensors. Fortunately I've found a pharmacy locally to handle my Dexcom orders now, and not have to deal with this nightmare. Judging by many other recent reviews, I'm not the only one with problems with this place.  Avoid this place if at all possible, I can't imagine dealing with this with insulin pump supplies since those are more important.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>VERY poor follow-through, VERY poor communication, VERY slow shipping of products. I understand that people are working remotely due to COVID, but if more than a year into the pandemic your business hasn't figured out how to communicate information even amongst co-workers in order to meet the needs of clients, the business is a failure. If you can find a covered supplier closer to home, I would recommend trying some place else.</review>< rate>

I have called three times on May 3. I followed their direction on the phone to hold my place in line and they would call back. Only time they called was at 12:33 and I was hung up on. I called right back and received the same message to press one and customer service would get back to me. No word from company so y called back and left a voice mail telling them I am not happy. I think people should contact their insurance.< /Text>

Would rate this 0 if possible. Insurance authorization on file since 4/7 I have yet to hear from this mediocre company after multiple calls. Hold times are ridiculous and when someone answers they keep saying authorization needs to be verified, even after I told them I am out of sensors and transmiter. Working with my insurance now to get Dexcom supplies elsewhere since this company is a joke!<//Review>

My daughter has been forced to transition to this vendor after being with Dexcom.  They never contacted me and I have gotten the run around from them for almost two months!  At first they needed an authorized, then a signed prescription, then a more clearly signed prescription, then my daughters medical chart notes, then a new letter with the number of sensors rather than days.  I have bent over backwards getting them everything they have continued to request and here we are two months into this and we still have NO Dexcom.  I keep calling and still have not received the equipment we need.  Worst experience ever!  Kid's shouldn't be forced to go without when we ha e insurance and have even offered to pay in advance.  It's RIDICULOUS!!</text>

Absolute worst service I have experienced in trying to receive needed Dexcom supplies.  I do not understand how this company can continue to exist.  I have called 8 times during business hours, left countless voicemails and requested a call back.  Once they called and didn't even let the phone ring a full one ring before hanging up.  I had the phone right beside me so I would not miss their call.  I am now calling Dexcom and going to beg them for a transmitter.  This company should be out of business.< /review>

<Text>Noone ever answers the phone! This is my third month on the dexcom and for the last 2 months I get the refill text... and... I reply following the instructions and nothing! I call everyday sometimes on hold for hours.. Noone answers! I leave voice mail fir a call back - Nothing ever! Then on my last day of the dexcom I drive an hour to my endo so they can call and get through some how and ADS ships to me 3 days later... But my dexcom already expired! ..... Hands down the worst company ever! Save yourself aggravation and fund another supplier</Text><GmapID>0x80dc749f6002c2b3:0xe3458b1592fae094</GmapID>< UserId.>

We have received dexcom supplies from this company for last 10 years, the last few years progressively worse service. At this point I need to review to warn those trying to decide what company to go with, AVOID this company if you have any other options. They do not follow through with obtaining auths, never give an update if order delayed, I have to call and harass every time we need an order filled to get them to work on it. Takes 45 mins on hold to get some clueless customer service agent to answer and tell me they are short staffed and "sorry looks like no one started the authorization" from 1 month ago!<//text>

It is entirely unacceptable to wait on hold for 1:46:24 and counting to talk to the intake department! I am absolutely furious at how unprepared this company is to handle any Dexcom orders! Not having supplies literally endangers the lives of diabetics and this company can’t be bothered to staff their call center with enough people! I have better things to be doing other than waiting on hold for two hours or more!<//review></record>

This company is really bad at sending prescription refills.  They will wait until the last possible day to send supplies and they just told me that it was their bad for not sending my refills after 90 days, and that they didn't even send communication to notify they weren't sending them automatically.   They pretty much suck.  Just avoid them</Text>

My experience with this company has included  excellent customer service which is important for me. When handling  my personal health, it is important that any company I deal with has excellent customer service. Advance diabetes supply cares about me and have been very responsive with me in all my interactions. Thank you A.D.S. !!!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

<text>I’ve never had as much problems with a medical supplies company as I have this one. I have multiple authorization letters and EOB’s showing they’ve been paid but I’m still getting past due notices. When I call I can never get the same person so I have to explain everything again.  I’ve been promised multiple times I’d be called back regarding my bill they say is overdue but not once have I received a call back.

<text>**FINAL UPDATE**
At first, I was very unhappy with ADS customer service for the reasons below. However, ADS was extremely proactive in remedying the situation and now I am extremely satisfied. As soon as my insurance approved the authorization, ADS got my order ready and out the door. I believe that my initial experience was not representative of ADS as a whole and I applaud their customer service department for going above and beyond to make sure I could get my supplies as fast as possible.

**UPDATE**
So, I'm actually really impressed with ADS customer service! Less than one day after I posted the original review, a rep contacted me and helped me get everything sorted out. It turns out we do need some more paperwork (which I found a little frustrating, because I was told multiple times by multiple reps that they had all the paperwork necessary and all I had to do was wait), but hopefully that was the last of the miscommunication. They also apologized for the lack of communication on behalf of the company and even offered to overnight me some testing materials so that I can check my blood sugars in the meantime. This interaction makes me hopeful that my previous experience with ADS was not representative of their customer service. I don't like leaving bad reviews on yelp, but I think that a company that deals with life-saving medical supplies should be held to a higher standard than say, a coffee shop. I will update this review hopefully just one more time after everything works out and I actually get my G6 system!

I've been trying to get on the Dexcom G6 and my experience with Advanced Diabetes Supply has extremely been frustrating. The process of getting the supplies I need has been delayed multiple times because different reps keep giving me the wrong information. They even sent a text message that an authorization had been submitted, but when I called to check in, it actually had not been submitted. To their credit, every rep I spoke to has been very friendly. My experience is detailed below:

ADS: "We spoke with your doctor's office yesterday, we have all the paperwork, and everything looks good. We'll give you a call when things are ready."

Me: *calls to check in two weeks later*

ADS: "Actually, we need your doctor's office to send us a form so we can send it to your insurance. After we get that, it'll take about a week for your insurance to approve it."

Me: ??? then why did you tell me everything was good and have me wait two weeks for nothing??? *Has doctor submit necessary paperwork in less than one day. calls ADS to check in a week later."

ADS: "Yes, we have all the paperwork and we just have to submit an authorization to your insurance. I'll submit it now, check back in a few days."

**They actually sent me a text message which states that the authorization was submitted as urgent and everything should be approved in about a week.

Me: *calls back a few days later to check AGAIN*

ADS: "Your authorization hasn't been submitted.... Yes, I see that someone sent you that text message, but they didn't actually submit the authorization. I'll submit it now and everything should be ready in about a week."

Me: ??????? Your company literally sent me a text message that my authorization had been submitted as "URGENT" and that I would only have to wait another week. Now my process of waiting a week is starting over??

Extremely frustrating... will be calling back tomorrow to see if they actually submitted the authorization.</text>< pictures>

I have to call them all the time to make sure my supplies are not delayed and they process insurance on time. If I left it up to them all my shipments would be delayed weeks or months and with a CGM, especially pregnant, that is NOT OKAY. That affects my health and my babies. Their laziness and lack of organization is not something that should affect my health. Each time I call i get told something else by a different person. I have had the same insurance, doctor, and prescription for almost five years now. The only thing that has gotten worse is them and how they handle their customers.</Text><Name>Heather Tydings< /Name><Gmap_id>0x80dc749f6002c2b3:0xe3458b1592fae094< /Gmap_id>< pics>

<text>This company is absolutely terrible . My daughter is Type 1 diabetic and has a prescription for sensors. She has no symptoms of low blood sugars and has had several lows during the day and middle of the night that we would not have been aware of except for her sensors.We have a great doctors office and great insurance. We never have any issue getting supplies or prescriptions EXCEPT with this company. Do Not use this company if you need to have your diabetes supplies sent on time. I have tried to give them chance after chance for over a year with her supplies and it is ALWAYS something and my daughter ends up going without her supplies for days up to weeks at a time< /text>< Pictures>

Wish I could give zero stars.  I ran out of transmitters and called for a new prescription.  I paid extra to overnight it.  They sent it ground.  It's been four days and counting that I've had no transmitters.  I called to complain and was told it's "out of their hands."  I asked to speak to a manager and was told that the leads were "in a meeting."  Very convenient.  I'm switching suppliers today.</Text>

I would give them zero stars. They were supposed to send my son's glucose sensors 9 days ago. They have an issue with the prescription, according to them. The doctor's office called them right away, the person from Medical left 2 messages to talk to the supervisor, I have called so many times and I still don't know if they have fixed it or not. Meanwhile, my son has been out of sensors for many days. Very frustrating. I hope Medical change to a different pharmacy. 9 days already since they should have shipped them!!</text>

<Review>I would give them no starts if possible. the bad reviews here say it all, long call wait times, give you the run around each time you need new supplies asking for multiple verifications via email, text and call. Completely inefficient and painful to deal with as a customer. the worst experience i have with any company.<//Review>< user_name>

<Text>I have talked with a couple of customer service reps that are polite and very accommodating.
Most if the time I can't get through to anyone to answer my calls and then when my call is returned I miss the call because I am hard of hearing.  The fact I didn't answer my return calls was a complaint to me.  This person hadn't done any research on my account to see a problem before she began leaving a message and then she realized while leaving this message I had also sent an e-mail that  my order was late she said, " Oh I see the order is late.  I can send it out right away."
I'm happy she sent it out but it seems getting most of my orders is a hassle.  I would really like to know why in writing so if it is the doctors office I could have something to show them to let them know what the problem is.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>As a former employee and diabetic ~ I would leave a zero if I could. This diabetes supply company not only refused to accommodate my diabetes during the COVID-10 pandemic, THEIR DIABETIC EMPLOYEE AT THE DIABETIC SUPPLY PROVIDER, they failed to notify me they had gathered my things and 'lost' them irretrievably. Garbage place to work and questionable service from an insider perspective.< /text>< date>

This disappointing, if not dismal, supplier has been slow in shipping my wife's supplies, I am the insurance holder, the past twelve months as well as very slow in communications, always a recorded telephone message that ask to leave a callback number or stay on Hold.  It was worst during this shelter-in-place period, when my wife called fives times, was disconnected four times before holding for 20 minutes whereupon she hung up in frustration.  She called a sixth time and used the company's callback option.  After a two hour wait, she inquired about her confirmed three month supply shipment that was scheduled to ship seven days earlier.  The company representative claimed that the company had lost its record of text orders (plural).  If true, then the company is irresponsible in not notifying my wife as these are important prescription products.  With great insurance and many choices, it's time to drop this dismal supplier, i.e. this company sucks.<//Text>

After several orders, they began saying there was problems with my prescription from my doctor which was never the case. My doctor has sent in everything that was required from the start.. I seen it myself.
Then, my orders weren't on time... they used to call or text me telling me it was time to reorder and would even provide the tracking number.
Now, it's no orders and no communication.  I've tried sending emails, phone calls,  text messages and no response.
They were supposed to send out an order last month and still nothing.
Very very bad and poor customer service.
Will be filing a complaint with their states attorney general.<//review>< pictures>

There needs to be an option for zero stars. This is an absolutely HORRIFIC company.  My son’s supplies were due to come in (late). It caused him to run out of sensors and his transmitter had expired. He was suffering from a weekend of scary lows so not having his supplies was extra dangerous. When I called they said their system was down they’d get back to me (they never did) in a couple days. We had no sensors or transmitters!!!!! Thankfully I called dexcom and they told me I could call my son’s endo and get an emergency refill through our pharmacy so I did. When I called ADS to see where our supplies were four days later they said they couldn’t fill the prescription because I got it filled somewhere else. WHAT???? I had to get it filled somewhere else because of THEIR negligence. Needless to say I yelled and eventually talked to a supervisor and his supplies are supposedly on the way. The gross negligence, apathy, and lack of urgency for providing life saving medical supplies is terrifying to say the least. I am asking my son’s endo to change our supplier our next appointment. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! They can care less about their customers.<//text>

If I could give this company zero stars, I would.. I don't even know where to start since Advanced Diabetes Supply has literally screwed up on so many fronts when it came to getting the proper pump supplies for my son. Now they refuse to field any phone calls or try to fix the issue. I would say they are on the borderline of being fraudulent at this point.< /Review>

<Review>I am shopping for a supplier for my Medtronic pump& Dexcom G6 CGM. I have had such bad customer service from suppliers that I HATE dealing with any & all suppliers. The problem is that Medtronics & Dexcom want to just concentrate on bettering their products, and they force us to use medical suppliers. PLEASE understand that if you would have great customer service, you could DOMINATE this business! All people want is good customer service! Read the complaints. They are the same that I have from other companies. SOMEONE IN THIS BUSINESS NEEDS TO STEP UP AND BE THE CHICK-FIL-A OF MEDICAL SUPPLY COMPANIES. Will it be you? Do you have the character, integrity and honesty to be the leader?  (I give you a 3 star because I do not want to hurt or help you since I am not a customer.)< /Review>< pictures>

I wish I could leave a no star review. Please please double think before going with them to receive your medical supplies. I have amazing insurance yet every 3 months when it came time to order my supplies they gave the run around each and every time. Asking for nonsense updates from doctor or insurance. My records were never updated despite me doing several follow ups. Do not go with with this company. I repeat DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY unless you like waiting weeks, even months on end to receive your supplies.</Review>

We have duel insurance and not one order has gone thru the second insurance. They are supposed to be changed every ten days but they will only fill after a calendar month plus 5-7 shipping days! that's a whole week of no Dexcom! its beyond unacceptable! Its sad we have pharmacy benefits but thru Durable Medical Plan its cheaper and goes twords our deductible but companies like this have no care to the patients actual medical needs. I would not recommend to anyone.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dc749f6002c2b3:0xe3458b1592fae094< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>THE WORST COMPANY EVER TO DEAL WITH AS A PATIENT & AS A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE DOCTORS OFFICE. DO NOT USE THEM!!
THEY WANT NOTES SIGNED BY DOCTOR, THEY GET THEM (AT THREE DIFFERENT FAX NUMBERS), THEN THEY COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE THEY NEED, THAT ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. THEY SAY THEY WANT A LETTER, SIGNED BY DOCTOR, YET STILL IT ISN'T ACCEPTABLE. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL. IT'S DISGUSTING THAT THESE PATIENTS CAN'T GET THEIR DIABETES SUPPLY IN A TIMELY MANNER. THIS ONE PARTICULARLY FREESTYLE LIBRE. IT IS SUCH A SHAME. THEY NEED TO SHUT THIS COMPANY DOWN OR REVAMP WITH ALL NEW WORKERS AND MANAGEMENT. I WILL NEVER USE THEM, NOR ANYONE IN MY OFFICE WILL RECOMMEND THEM.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dc749f6002c2b3:0xe3458b1592fae094</gmap_id></record>

My cgm company sent me to this place for supplies and told me they will call within a week. It's been at least 2 weeks and I haven't heard from them. No contact whatsoever. I was told by my doctor that my cgm would be easier to get then my insulin pump. But yet my pump came in already. I use a different company for my pump and they were amazing. Customer service sucks. They never even called me about my insurance or how much the supplies would be. I am type 1 diabetic and trying to get healthy again and this place isnt allowing me to</review>

The absolute worst ever . They do not ship orders on time . You must call in order for them to ship out your supply . They move my shipping date because I didn’t receive some email to confirm which I never ever did! Pure BS !! Bad company please order some another place !< /Review>

Absolutely terrible experience and customer service.  To refill a prescription you have to work through an automated phone system.  The system asks for you to leave a message but the mailbox is full.  How can a company providing life saving supplies treat patients this way? Consider this a warning to avoid working with Advanced Diabetes Supply.< /text>

They are incompetent and will lie to patients to cover for themselves.   The amount of paperwork they filled out is excessive and unnecessary.  Your fax will be lost, you will wait forever for supplies/ if you ever get them at all.  Medicare patients:   You have better options for supplies.

They sent me an invoice charging me a grandiose amount for supplies from last year, which were completely covered by my insurance at the time. I've been trying to get a hold of them repeatedly through email and by phone to sort his out, and no one is answering. This is horrible customer service -- I'm hoping a negative review will finally grab their attention.</text>

Terrible experience getting prescription for Omnipods verified by ADS/Northcoast Medical Supply. My doctors office sent all necessary paperwork over about a week ago and I have yet to receive a shipment confirmation from them. I received conflicting information from sales reps last week, was even told I was dropped by my provider which was not true (but the most horrifying thing a patient can hear), was not contacted with follow-up information as promised and have called three times this week to get in contact with them and have yet to speak with anyone. I've been stressed and worried all week; I literally need these supplies to live. I am livid and disappointed and would not recommend anyone use this supplier. This is a MEDICAL SUPPLY company and any and all issues should be treated professionally and urgently.< /Review>

They have never called back as promised nor did anything they said they would do.  I am filing complaints with Medicare, Soc. Sec., and the Attorney General.  They should not be on the Governments list of suppliers when they are unable or unwilling to be responsive.  I am now out of supplies, waiting for these 'PHONIES' to do what they applied with the Federal Government to do.  Lee Thibadeau</Text>< response>

ADS became my new provider of diabetes test strips in the summer of 2016 and it took months to get my strips.  Clearly the company was overwhelmed and did not have the staff to run this program effectively.  I spent hours calling and emailing to get the strips.  I ran out of supplies twice.  Finally when I decided it must be a fradulent company, I sent letters to the appropriate agencies.  Then a Sales person from ADS
called me and sent my strips but also many other products that I did not need or never use at a great cost to medicare my insurance and me.  And now I also have a pile of supplies that I will never use.  What a waste!!!<//Text>

Ordered  test strips and lancets almost a month ago.
Still don't have them.  I called and the girl on the phone had lots of excuses.
She said Dr. didn't send prescription.  I know they did !
Order still not shipped.
All of this BS didn't happen when I went to Costco and walked out with my order.
Customer service is lousy !</Text>

I have worked with them for a bit more than a year now getting Dexcom CGM supplies. My account manager has always been very helpful, and calls before I am due for a refill to set everything up. Supplies arrive on time, and they handle all of the insurance billing. If you are a CGM or  insulin pump user, check these folks out.< /Review>

I think this business is no longer operating.  I have been trying to reorder supplies since mid June.  I was PROMISED a shipment over a week ago.  I have called more than a dozen times, waiting on hold for over TWO hours without talking to a human, and have emailed them three times.  I am without my prescription right now.  My only conclusion is these guys are CLOSED and no longer in business.  If you are diabetic and relying on these guys you are way out of luck.<//review>

I usually only write positive reviews, but my experience with Advanced Diabetes Supply has been so frustrating that I just had to write a negative review.  First of all, getting someone on the phone is nearly impossible.  If you leave a message, it takes days for them to return your call.  I am a Type 1 diabetic that uses an insulin pump and must check my blood sugar 8 times a day.  Even with sending BG logs and office visit chart notes, I have never been able to be approved to get the number of test strips needed.  This last time, after talking with someone at ADS at least daily for 2 weeks and my doctor faxing the same information to them at least 4 times, I have transferred my prescription to WalMart.  If you use an insulin pump and are on Medicare Part B to cover your diabetes supplies, do not waste your time on Advanced Diabetes Supply!< /Text>

It boggles my mind that such a company can be doing business with my BC/BS insurer as a supplier of critical diabetes supplies, but I guess having no human beings on staff to make sure customers are actually getting their products saves a lot on overhead costs.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>This is a HORRIBLE company to get supplies through. They have "forgot" to send my omni pod supplies on several occasions, and then offering to overnight the supplies for free, they still charged me for the over night delivery fee. I have called the company several times to discuss this and when I finally got a live person on the phone they told me it was processed and would take a few days. It has literally been 4 weeks, and no one at this company can seem to help me. They also "forgot" to send my supplies again this month, and did the same thing to me. They are very frustrating to work with, and cannot seem to figure out that people with diabetes need their supplies and cannot go days without it.

<text>Having trouble reordering Dexcom supplies.  They used to call way too often for refills but now never call me at all. Trying to call them is tough and I'm not sure if they have a website reorder system. When calling I always have to leave a message, today because recording said they they are all in a meeting and can't answer phones.  Other problem is the number of times I have to renew/reverify my prescription causing me additional doctor visits and delays while getting all the redundant paperwor, this time just because it's a new calendar year.< /text>< name>

< Review>
I am an insulin dependent diabetic.  I am now out of test strips thanks to Advanced Diabetes supply.  I have attempted for 3 weeks to get my 3 month suppply.  firwt it was because I needed a prescription trenewal from my doctoer.  then it was because he had not refilled it, and could I call him.  Then when I verified that he had refilled it, it was because he did not fill out the paperwork properly.  When I derterminied that was corrected, it was to be delivered next tuesday, When they determined today was also tuesday, it was to be delivered today.  I even called twice today to verify delivery.  Wrong again!  Now I can not test my blood!  There is something terribly wrong with this company, or is this personal?  Guess I had better find another firm to provide me with diabetic supplies.< /Review>

Five and a half weeks since my doctor sent in a prescription for test strips and lancets under Medicare.  As of today "the one person who handles medicare will get back to you, sometime."  Do not use this supplier.<//Review>

I refuse to let my patients do business with this company.  They will lie to patients and blame me and my staff for their incompetence.  You are NOT required to use this business for your diabetic supplies.  Please call your insurance company and find alternatives.< /Review>

Absolutely worst customer service, stay away. They yelled at a customer Egypt received the wrong order, told him"this isn't a Macy's, the food is out". They are terrible people. The food is fine and well seasoned, but you have no reason to support these awful people who manage the store.<//Text>

<review>Nice Hotpot, Reasonable Prices

Having read so many good reviews, I decided to give Famous Bao a try. I went on a Thursday afternoon. It was after lunch hours so it wasn't too crowded. I ordered the Signature Spicy Hotpot for $10. It was yummy though a little too salty. The portion was large, and came with a rice too.

Maybe it was the expectations I had so the experience didn't seem quite as enjoyable as it should be. Go with no expectations to enjoy!< /review>< user_name>

<time>1531694303610</time><rate>5<//rate><text>Highly recommend the beaf rib noodle(牛肉干扯面). This noodle is the classic meal for farmers in the middle west part of china. That area is a plateau and always lack of water. At hot summer, farmers are pretty tired and thirsty when finishing a whole day's of work. So theirs wife will save the noodle in the cold water. When husband come back, they grap the noodle from water, add chili powder and vinegar on the top, then pour a touch of boiled oil to release the sour and spicy flavor. With this flavor, farmers could cheer up theirs spirit quickly and get cooled down from the hot weather. That's the history behind the dish. You could taste 90% genuinue flavor at this restaurant.

Why is the place called "Bao" when there aren't bao? No matter, the sichuan dishes, such as cumin lamb and off-menu Chongqing spicy chicken, are fragrant with freshly toasted whole spices, kept piping hot over a candle. Service is, um, unusual but fast. Counter service.< /Text>

One of the more authentic X’ian place around, the hand pull noodles are firm and tasty.The Stewd oxtail soup base are so meaty flavored. The Stewed pork burger was good, but a bit dry.

Just look at the people who eats there, all Asians ;-)</Review>

There are some other dishes but this is what you should do. Play to your strength, crush it on the speed of the service and leave people slightly dazed and confused at how good the food is at the price.

Really cannot say enough about this place other than that I will be back. My kids even seemed to like it. Go figure.< /review>

<text>It's shockingly bad. I went in for some bao but they didn't have it. Asked for the Chinese pork burger, they didn't have that either. Finally I got the cumin lamb rice. It came out without a single cumin in it, tasteless! The lamb was flavorless and rubbery. You can just tell the meat quality is horrible. Onion was still raw and pungent. Worse food I've ever had. Felt so sick right after eating there.<//text></record></dataset><record>
<GmapID>0x80857c28b2404043:0x90056544a5c533c7< /GmapID><text>I was lured to this place by the good reviews but I had a bad experience overall. My noodle bowl was served pretty much cold and the taste was not the one I expected given the price and portion. They were oily and very salty. They surcharge you almost a dollar for purchases under $20 if paid with card (when most places around requires a $5 minimum purchase or no minimum, I think this is ridiculous since an average meal there cost under $20). 355ml soda can cost almost 4 dollar with taxes, like c'mon! In addition, you can tell the lady at the cashier don't like her job by the way she address to you. Who knows! maybe was not her day. In any case, I hope you have a better experience than mine, but I won't be eating there again.<//text><Date>1554692010078</Date>< UserId.>

Tied with dumpling express as the best chinese place near Cal. Just like dunplong express, avoid the food in their name and stick to the stuff on white rice - their iron pots in this case. Spicy seafood's the best, but others are solid too. Noodles are actually delicious, but not quite as filling</text>

The Spicy Beef Handpulled noodles (C2) are my absolute favorite dish ever. I I have been coming here at least every other week just for that dish for the last 8 months.  Service is sometimes slow but it's worth the wait.<//Text>

<date>1537235624662<//date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Maybe I'm not their target audience, but this place was awful. Ordered three cup chicken and lamb noodle soup. Three cup chicken was Wok fried breaded chicken with too much wine, salt, and sweet chili sauce. There was nothing of three cup chicken flavor in it at all. Generous portions of meat and tender pieces, though. Noodle soup was over salted and noodles were under done. Tasted like a big bowl of I don't care. The place was stuffed full of tables so that there's hardly any room to walk in between tables. Full House at dinner time, but don't understand why. My basis for comparison is Terracotta Warrior in  San Francisco  and any Taiwanese restaurant in the South Bay. Maybe we should have ordered their specialties, which was steamed buns and rou jia mo. But I won't bother. Not recommended.< /text>< Pics>

<review>I walked into this restaurant on Shattuck Ave with my service dog with the curiosity to try out their menu, the very first thing I heard from the restaurant owner/host was "No dogs, you need to leave !"  I was downright shocked by this guy's ignorance and hostility. After I politely explained my disability for a service dog and specific tasks performed by my dog, he only replied: "Your dog doesn't look like a service dog, you can't be here, you need to leave."

I don't care if the food is good or not, he's rude attitude completely kills my appetite! I can never enjoy eating at a restaurant that conducts its business in this way.< /review>< time>

The cashier man that took my order was very rude to me for no reason, and then full-on yelled at a young couple who said they ordered their food to go and not for here. It was super intense. Not a good vibe here even if the food is decent.< /text>

The noodle is super good and truly authentic. I ordered the handpulled noodles and both the soup and noodles are awesome.

The braised eggplant over rice is one of the best I have had in the US too.</Text>

I like to go here they have very interesting food that isn't like most Chinese food you have. Their handpulled noodles are really good so try those! They charge for card if it is under 15$ so bring some cash. Here is a photo of my friend eating there.<//text>

It was sour, but in a weird way – the soup made my tongue tingly and numb. I usually enjoy sour soups, but it tasted like somebody accidentally poured cleaning liquid into the soup. I left the dish 95% uneaten. And no, I am not picky at all. I honestly think they might have poured bleach into the soup.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Quality of the food is very good. Service can be slow at times. I recommend what they call a "Chinese Hamburger," which is actually a savory filling placed into a thick wheat wrapper, sort of like a bao dough. They are very inexpensive but also very filling. Their bao is very good, far above supermarket bao</Review>

It's Chinese food that hasn't been Americanized, and it's a delight to have a different tasting Chinese food nearby that isn't orange chicken-ish. I will be coming back again to try their Bao which is supposed to be their specialty. Don't be snobby and expect good service or a pretty ambiance. The food is great and affordable. Just order the noodle soup, eat, and be happy.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I like the food here for the first few times. But One day I tried to order a pickup over the phone, the person in the phone did not tell me that they do not accept orders on the phone, instead, he just said "ok, one P1 to go, thank you byebye".

Then I went there to pick up my order and asked whether my food is ready, that middle-aged "long-face" guy suddenly shouted at me: "We dont take orders on the phone! Go talk to the guy you talked in the phone!"

You guys should see his face. I was just asking cuz I dont know they dont take phone orders. Is that a reason the guy shout at you? Here's his words: " I feel stupid when you keep asking." Literally I just asked once and was kept waiting for their answers for 10 minutes.

I was really angry at how he treated a customer. Btw, if you still want to go there to eat. Try to order within 3 seconds you see the menu and dont ask anything, cuz there is an uneducated bad-tempered guy who was gonna shout at you and thought you were stupid. Hope you enjoy!<//Review>< Pics>

<Name>zijia li< /Name><text>(Translated by Google) The experience is very poor. Is the sense of superiority strong? ? Because the pronunciation is not good, you can say the customer. Which person will go to specialize in the pronunciation of the food, and it is normal to read it incorrectly. In short, I personally think that this service has no attitude.

(Original)
体验感很差 优越感很强？？因为发音不好就可以说顾客 请问哪个人会去专门学食物的发音，读不对也很正常好么。总之我个人认为这家没有服务业应该具有的态度</text>< gmap_id>

Amazing customer service. Knowledgeable staff. Drinks made quickly. Not supersaturated with sugar, but just right. Great prices. This is my favorite place to order tea.< /review>

Best. Bubble. Tea. In. LA. We used to bounce from place to place trying bubble tea until we found Refresh! Just so you know, this is the *freshest* tea you will taste! You can tell it's not powder and/or loaded with sugar. Though the passion fruit black tea is very good, my go-to is black milk tea with boba. There are other additional toppings you can add to your drink and you can also adjust the amount of ice (i.e. regular, less, etc.). If you're in the mood for baked good, try their amazing chocolate chip cookies! In addition to offering phenomenal products, Refresh is a small business and the owners are awesome. When you factor in all of the above, not sure what else you could ask for!< /review>

<text>Yes. The boba is delicious - soft and warm with just enough gumminess. One of the better shops for the boba. Tea is not like Ding Tea sweet, so good for those who don't want that level of sweetness. Nonetheless, also delicious to the point where 1/3rd of my milk tea was gone between me going from the counter where the straws were and the table behind me. It's not strong on the tea flavor like Tea Station, where it tastes like Tea with sugar and flavor. Instead, it's balanced between the tea and milk with just enough ice to make it a hit. An instant favorite for my friend who will definitely visit soon (because she's local and because she has not yet found a good boba shop until today)!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTT-Y_RAESP99xsaH-wziaObZgPMuYb0IjG7u1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgCnXEkqB3W_hqMg17ssn6ectq0CWVVla2BlNc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><GmapID>0x80c2ba8a3169e4b3:0x8e997d8e23ec7d64<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is me replying to owner we ordered the boba green tea mango yesterday Thursday evening around 6 pm and we do not need a refund and there should be signs in your tea place letting customers know after ordering during the pandemic to wait outside for your order to be more professional and not make customers feel weird to be told go wait outside kinda sounds rude we did go in with our mask on and left it on the whole time even while we waited outside and you should go test out the flavors of your teas see if the flavors taste as they’re supposed to you should always put yourself in the customers place how you would want to be treated as a customer and how you  would want to teas to taste like and I only left 2 stars to be honest how I felt as a customer and I also say put signs to wait outside you were our second choice of place to get boba tea the first choice there was no parking at the tea place and we also saw a couple of customers waiting in the tea place about a group of 5 people customers waiting inside for they’re boba tea<//Text>< Pictures>

Customers used to wait inside, but the health department came in and ordered us to have them wait outside. So please understand it's the pandemic and leaving us a bad review because of that is a bit unfair to a business that is already having to deal with the pandemic. If you ordered a mango green tea we should have used green tea and not black tea. Can you let me know when you ordered so I can look into it I'll be happy to issue you a refund."}< /Resp>

<Text>Since moving to LA from NY I have struggled to find a good bubble tea shop. I seriously looked everywhere for a year and had no idea refresh was less than a mile from my apt. This is by far the best in town and easily compares to my favorite shop in NY. I got the thai milk with boba and it was HEAVEN. Definitely my new go to!< /Text>< time>

I like boba and this is my favorite spot on the westside. The boba is typically very fresh and easy to chew. And they're milk teas are spot on. They also have little fruit flavored poppers that I also like in my green teas. I highly recommend this place.<//Text>

Good cold brew coffee. Get it a double with no water little ice. Don't forget the cream and no sugar. If you smoke ... It will pit in work. Just don't drink it too fast ... Enjoy it. Don't forget to tip ... Don't be cheap.<//text>

<text>Quaint, no frills shop with great quality drinks. We had the coconut milk tea (iced) & lemon ginger (hot) with boba, and they were both great. My sis got the lemon ginger drink hot, which I'd never tried but it was really great. My coconut milk tea tasted really fresh, not artificial or with a weird aftertaste like some places coconut flavors can be. Still craving more!<//text>< pictures>

The boba is super good. Recommend mango green tea and black milk tea. The reason I gave 4 stars is because boba portion is too small. I wish they can increase the portion.< /review>

Very rude I'm not coming back, I wonder he wants customer or he wants to scare customer? You don't treat customer bad, you treat them well if you want them to come back, at least that's what I would do if I have a business.

Edit: I also read in this rating another customer that have the same issue, so yes,  definitely not coming back.< /review>

<text>Entrance is hard to find relative to where Google maps dropped off. It's in the building next door to the Thai restaurant (which has a giant sign). They have one size only. Lots of great add ons. Alternative milk available but the option is in tiny font. Got the lychee green tea and a milk tea. The lychee was refreshing and delicious but the milk tea tasted thin. Ask for light ice because half the cup will be ice. Sugar level is light for the milk tea so full sugar will taste like 50-75% from other places.</text></record></dataset><record>

the tea is pretty good! i’ve been here twice and gotten green milk tea with boba. it’s a family run place so in the back they have like kids toys and sometimes napping children on their couches. not too much seating but they have a small lot in the back which is a plus<//Text>

<review>I've gone back here a couple more times to try different variations of the milk tea (Green Milk Tea and Salted Caramel Milk Tea). My husband always gets the Thai Milk Tea with extra boba. This has become our go-to spot for boba on the Westside.

The tapioca balls had a good texture during my last couple of visits. I'm not sure how they do it, but the center of the tapioca ball tastes sweeter than the outside and it's quite delicious biting into it. I also like how the different flavors of the milk tea are not overly sweet; you can actually taste the tea part of the milk tea<//review>< rating>

I love the staff at the shop which is really important for me since it's the closest one from my school. The boba is a really good amount of sweetness and chewiness and there's quite a lot compared to other shops I've been to for the regular amount (which is it you don't order the extra boba). The drinks themselves are also very good as well as the prices (unless you order add-ons, everything's mostly no more than $4.50). There aren't too many people (unless the occasional times where there's a long line) but they have really fast service and they almost always get my order right (but they always make it again if you ask). This is one of my top two favourite places :)< /text>

{'time': 1556414835322, 'text': "Hi Lindsay mocha shake isn't on the menu so it's not an item people are trained to make. Our menu is small because we like to make a few drinks and do it well, it's our commitment to quality and you will see shops that make a lot of drinks not very good. Natural fruit we have passion fruit and grapefruit. All boba shops put boba in some kind of a syrup which has sugar that's the standard practice for any boba shop. We make our syrup every day out of natural sugar. Sorry we couldn't make you happy."}<//response>

No frills place with delicious fish tacos. I got the two taco platter. Right near light rail in the gas lamp district. Nice staff. Patio and indoor seating. Surprisingly extensive menu given the size.< /Review>

Was downtown and discovered this little gem on my trip to SD.  Their fish tacos are amazing! I just got the 2 fries tacos with waffle fries and boy did it bring joy to my taste buds. The fish was perfectly crispy and the sauces blended perfectly for taste. The waffle fries were also delicious and they provide you with ample ketchup and hot sauce. All for under $10!</Text>

The 1/2 catfish plate special is a really great value. With a drink the whole thing was less than 10 bucks. (Without its a little over 7 with tax) Great for a quick lunch and they even have hotsauce to mix with ketchup for the criss cross fries served along side. They also provide a lemon which I like to mix into the tasty tartar sauce they serve. I couldn't help but take a bite before I took this picture because the smell was so yummy.< /Review>

We shared the halibut tacos (about 5$ each) and the fish & chips (about 13$), both very delicious! Friendly staff & no wait!< /Text>

We are visiting from out of town and found this place from the reviews on yelp. Was not disappointed! Tasty lobster rolls and great clam chowder! We were served even though we came right at closing. Wish we could visit again.</review>

Walked in at around 4 PM in a group of 10 people half of them under 16 years of age. The litmus test was that no one complained about the food and the location.
We all loved it!</review>

My dad ordered the fried shrimp and ate every last bite, covered in chunky tarter without so much as a word. Waffle fries are crispy and very salty, and the cole slaw is best eaten flipped out of the dish so the juice (and flavor) no longer hides on the bottom. I ate every last chicken tender (4 tenders in the half order, w/ 4 bites of cole slaw, a side of ranch, and a heap of steaming waffle fries) but very sadly couldn't finish my fries. Worth the inexpensive price for hefty portions. Small parties acceptable in the restaurant, but our party of 5 +2 kids had a hard time squeezing in an almost full dining room.<//text>

The seafood combo plate was delicious and had a large variety of seafood (shrimp, scallops, salmon, and I think two other types of white fish). Well worth the $13. Their fish tacos are huge too. We ate outside and enjoyed the fresh air. Great place.</text>

The guy at the counter couldn't be nicer.  This is definitely a hole in the wall spot but so delicious.  Clam Chowder is bomb and so is the crab cakes. Fries are yum ares well. Downside is they close before dinner but the prices make up for that.< /Review>

If you like fish you'll love this spot. I had the fish tacos and they're BIG and come with a side of criss-cut fries, so it's MORE than I could eat.

Just wish the atmosphere was a little nicer. Sitting outside was comfy, but you're right on the trolly tracks and there's flies. Inside felt a little cramped and just looks a little dirty. Nevertheless, really recommend this if you're into fish/seafood.< /text>

<Text>Let me first say Google had the location wrong, it is at on C and 4th. I sent an update so hopefully they fix that.

I read the reviews and figured what the heck. When I got here at 1230 the place was packed. I ordered the fried fish burrito, fries, and Cole slaw $9.95 and a side of onion rings. The burrito was huge and for the money you can not go worng.

This appears to be a local joint. I didn't see any tourists walking in, which I view as a positive (I'm not from around here and like to eat where locals eat.) The place was clean and currently has an A rating posted.

Overall I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't the best burrito I had in my life. I was starving and the meal tasted good and filled me up. I had every intention of ordering more for a second round but couldn't fit it. I will definitely be back to try the grilled fish tacos.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

After reading the Yelp reviews I decided to give this place a try since I wanted shrimp but didn't want to spend a small fortune. I ordered a grilled shrimp taco and onion rings to go.  The food was cooked to order, I was in and out in 15 minutes.  For $4.50 the ship taco was large enough but not that flavorful, the onion rings were $3.25 and the portion size was enough to feed to people but again not that tasty.  The coating of the onion rings was cornmeal based which is different but I didn't particularly like it.  I doubt I will be back since that are a ton of seafood restaurants to explore down town.</text>

This place is unreal. Fish tacos are out of this world and they have a bunch of types. On top of that it's way cheap. Can't come to SD without trying this place.</Review>

the fish was alright, nothing extraordinary. i ordered the catch of the day combo(mahi mahi and chips) it was $10 advertised as 5-9 pieces of fish, i only got 4 medium sized pieces.... maybe they are inconsistent, maybe just shady. you will have to try it.</text>

I mean what can you really say about arco. The price of the gas here is the real reason why most people come here. Unfortunately it's in a pretty rough neighborhood but I feel like the staff does the best they can with what they have. If you don't mind bums coming up asking wash your car windows or pump your gas for you then this is some of the best quality cheap gas. They always have a really good selection of drinks and other convenient items inside.< /text>

<Review>I'm so impressed with them, they've become my go-to store.
Actually they're the closest.
This, however, doesn't matter, because the staff is (with maybe one exception] is most courteous.
With the short selection, they are still my first choice.< /Review>< rate>

well run, the staff are efficient. The excessive panhandling In the parking lot is a bit much, but the workers and such are doing their jobs exceptionally well. I frequent it often, and admire the well greased(just as metaphore) machine.</review>

Go! Gas & Food but its Arco, well they alright. I need gas. And my experience okay I guessed.

If you’re asking the surrounding of the place... then I have few comments to say.
Place is filled with all kinds. Trash, rowdy customers, Pandlers, this is a bz area.

Furthermore, the customer aren’t allowed to enter because staff closed it. Only to use outside window for purchase in CASH only.
I can only say this place is a different culture meaning I noticed the staff handling customer money but is eating chips with the other hand. Kinda filthy in my opinion but again culture wise I am still getting use to it.

Pandlers they walk and talk to the wall for some odd reasons then comes up to the customer for handout. I can get use to this.<//Review>

<text>It gets kinda ghetto here some times but nobody messes with you. Very quick service. Be CAREFUL when you pulled up, lots of blind spots if everyone's there gasing up at the same time. Always packed here.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Rate>

This should not even be called PHO. Worst I’ve ever had. Smelled like tons of ginger it was disgusting and had 0 flavor.Who puts cauliflower in pho?  The spring rolls were not rolled correctly they were so bad. We walked out after a few bites.
I highly do not recommend this to anyone!! Such a joke!<//Review>

I've been looking all over for a yummy veggie pho. I finally came across this place and it definitely fulfills the cravings. I went two days in a row just for the pho. Very simple yet delicious and good pricing. Can't wait to explore more items on the menu.<//review>

Only way to describe is with one word...GREAT!!
Great service! Great food! Great quality!! Nice little place to sit down and enjoy Pho and some egg rolls. Might not look like much from the outside but don't let that fool you. Sweetest little lady also. Highly recommend you stop by and try it out!</review>

The best spring rolls! You can taste the healthy freshness in their Pho with no fatty sensation you usually get when you eat most Pho. The service is excellent. A little Vietnamese restaurant with a big heart and authentic Vietnamese flavor.</Review>

I realized that is a good thing, because this Pho is delicious. Her menu doesn’t have a ton of variety, but I don’t want it to. She rocks at making what she offers and I wouldn’t want her to lower her quality to put any more effort into a bigger menu.</Text>< user_name>

<Review>Run by a single lovely lady, Trinity is exactly as expected-her variation on bahn mi is quite good with pork + pork pate-spicy with chunks of jalapeños and siracha.  Could use more pickled veggies but overall a delicious Sammie.
The spring rolls are messy but delicious with pork and shrimp with peanut sauce.
The “coffee” part of it might be a bit misleading only because it’s just a mister coffee serving you up your beans.<//Review>< pics>

Good food. Long wait 70 minutes for one pho and 3 orders of egg rolls. Lots of pickup orders ahead of us but arent soup and egg rolls prepared ahead of time? Rolls can be cooked in minutes. I'll call an hour ahead next time.<//Text>

Yesterday I gave this place a try, worst Pho I have ever eaten. Bad broth, meat and the vegetables made me feel like I was eating caldo de res.  I ordered the egg rolls and instead I got a  warm spring rolls with hot chicken and cold vegetables. I didn't mind her mistake in giving me spring rolls instead of egg rolls, but they were terrible, hot greasy chicken wrapped with cold onion and cabbage... gross. Made me want to go back and get my $20 back but instead I'll just not go back. I knew Pho in Santa Paula was too good to be true.</text>

The owners are super nice and the food is very fresh. For a primarily to go restaurant in house service was fairly fast and very attentive. I would urge people to gauge their expectations this is a mom and pop, not a giant chain so plan accordingly.

The food was awesome. Light on the salt with is rare with most pho. The menu is simple yet encompasses everything you could want in a dining expirence.< /review>< username>

Job is fairly straight forward. Do as you are told and you should do just fine.
Training there is a 1/10. They do not thoroughly train you for anything there. Management is horrible, reason I left, 0/10, seems as though the workers that stack boxes there manage the building better. I’m giving it a 5 stars so i can attract more of y’all here and see how easy it is but how horrible management is😂😂. GOOD LUCK< /text>

<Review>Been here only twice so far with Bonfire Enterprises  (vía Eagle Brokerage)

Today was a “driver appreciation” day. I have yet to see a any warehouse do this in my two fast paced years as a truck driver. First time I was here the customer service was awesome, this time was too. Five Stars for professionalism on both visits. Thank you all for being part of a great team</Review>< Pics>

Horrible, first driver said he couldn’t deliver when the gate was open I know for a fact because I was home. Then was lied to about the package being redelivered the next day, called CS and was told it was in transit and to expect it by the end of the day, when apparently it never even made it back to the warehouse the first day, they have no clue where my package is I had to continuously call them, and got lie after lie before they finally admitted it was marked missing since the first day!! Horrible service!< /review>

Utter rubbish.  Always late by 1-3 days for delivery from their commitment date.  This place should be closed for good!  Vendors should stop using this service.</review>

Not a bad place to work.  Although I feel there are favorites there. Not everyone treated the same. Not sure if they fear that people will quit, but some workers just sit around talking or texting on the phone while the rest work. Pay is not bad for being a permanent PT job. Leaders need schooling on how to be leaders. Most of them are young and unprofessional. Don't know how to interact with people.  Lack of grammar.  Just yelling through out warehouse and flirting with every female there just don't cut it. There are strong workers who should be in leadership position. I'm a team player,  I just try to get my work done and out.  This is my 2nd job..</review>

<review>Ontrac  is the worst. The other reviewer who rated them 5 stars must work for them. I have had 4 packages that were not delivered when tracking stated they were. One turned up the next morning while another turned up the following evening at 9:00pm. It would have sat there all night if the dog had not alerted me to his presence since the driver did not bother to ring the doorbell. In fact, when they do deliver they never ring the door bell. I would be nice to know your package has been delivered since you cannot depend on their tracking information.
The other two packages were never found and Amazon had to reship them.
Read the reviews about Ontrac. I'm surprised Amazon puts up with them.< /review><gmap_id>0x80e84c040eddd0bd:0xaa6dc34156d58582< /gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1517154208939<//Time>< user_name>

So,  I get medical supplies delivered through OnTrac. Problem is that there are so many POD parolee types stealing stuff,  tray I can't chance having my packsge left on door. Ontrac allows you to call to and have package placed on hold for will call. When you show up,  they seem to not only be confused, but don't seem to know that they are open as per their 800 number and web site. UPS and Fedex never a problem,  but these guys...<//review>

<text>Excellent Deli Company just a few miles from LAX and the Beach!!  Got a few sandwiches for lunch. Prices weren't too bad, although I do miss the Old Hogan's Heroes that used to be next door to the Del Rey Deli Co.  They use high quality meats and their bread is as tasty as anything.  Give them a try and judge for yourself.  I'm sure You Won't be sorry, as we were all pleased!</text>< pics>

Sandwiches are fairly expensive but are definitely some of the best I'm the area. The bread really sets these sandwiches apart, along with the quality of deli meats offered.</text>

A great small local deli spot with a friendly staff, delicious sandwiches, soups & great pour over coffee.

We love walking here from our place & hanging outdoors & enjoying the delicious eats.

They have several cold & hot sandwiches, to-go soups & salads which are all well priced.

They absolutely have the best fried chicken sammich in LA. I promise you it’s better than Popeyes!</Text>

I have been here a few times, but today was the first since our stay at home orders. Got the vegetarian mushroom Reuben sandwich and it was really tasty. Everything worked on this sandwich. Great job guys!<//Text>

My first visit was the one that got me hooked. The owner happened to be trying out different menu items and was cooking a hamburger to dial in for his menu. I had ordered a sandwich and he asked me if I wanted a hamburger to try to tell him what I thought. I love free food. But that was one of the most delicious Burgers I've had in a long time. Sandwiches are incredibly fresh quality ingredients good size portion at a really great price. There green chili pork stew is a 10. I highly recommend this place to anyone who appreciates quality products with a friendly staff</Text>

<Review>Terribly overpriced. I’m going to keep it short and simple. Food was good, service was okay. Aside from the hipsters, man buns and excruciating prices ($15 for a sandwich, drink, bag of chips) the food was good. Will I be back, hell naw.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I can't imagine anyone being unhappy with the food or service here. Everything we ordered was delicious and the 3 dollar iced coffee was so good I didnt even need to put my usual sweetener in it. We had a breakfast special sandwich with lox and pickled onions and the parm breakfast hash and did half and half swapsies and both were very tasty!</Text><date>1558980417556< /date></record></dataset><record>

Never answers phone when you want to place an order  and charges more
On GrubHub... frustrating when you
are  in a hurry. Needs a better operation setup or takeout system not gauging customers< /text>

<text>My brother's flight was delayed about an hour so when we got to LAX, we had some time to kill and some bellies to fill.

A google search put this among the best places near the airport for breakfast/lunch and so we tried it out.

No regrets here! It does not look like much from the outside but the breakfast sandwiches and the avocado toast we're huge and delicious!

More than enough food for the price and so so good! Would recommend if you need something close to the airport (about 15-20 minutes for us in morning traffic).<//text><username>Sarah Weber</username><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

< review>
I was early for an eye exam in the shop next door, so I stopped in here yesterday for a sandwich.  I ordered an old fave, a grilled cheese, which arrived stuffed with cheese, and lightly toasted sourdough, not grilled and greasy.  Best grilled cheese I've had in years, and I ate at a pleasant outdoor table.  I plan on being early for my next appt with the eye doctor, and repeating the cheese sandwich.<//review>

<Text>The quality of the meat & smoked salmon  here are exceptionally good! You want some lovely brisket on your beet salad? No problem! If you're a real carnivore, ask for double meat--it's worth it! But plan to go outside of busy hours, as they don't have a lot of tables vs the number of customers. Service is usually quite fast, and the staff are good-natured!</Text><rating>5< /rating>< Resp>

<text>Short story: Sandwiches are good but service is slowwwwwwww and not too friendly. If you are coming on your lunch time, choose another spot.

Long story: I moved to this area back in June of this year and I have been here 3x. 2 visits to dine in and 1 to go. Each time was slow. Doesn't matter the time of day.

The first visit which I was pretty excited because I love delis gave me a terrible impression. They forgot our order haha! I paid and I had the buzzer in my hand and was sitting at the table. I figured it was lunch time so I would be patient but no they forgot our order. I went up to them after about 15 mins and no one seemed to care that they forgot.
The second time they didn't forget our order but was still slow. The third time I figured place an order to go maybe.. just maybe it will be faster. No it wasn't.

I wanted to love this place but I'm afraid life is too short.<//text>< Pics>

Great little neighborhood deli. Excellent sandwiches (The Pioneer) and egg pretzel breakfast-sandwiches. The soups are top drawer as well. And who else besides Pollo Inka carries Inca Kola? They play great rock music all day long too.</Text>

Not sure why people love this place.  They aren’t particularly friendly and the prices are high for what they’re peddling.  A bagel with cream cheese and a weak drip thru coffee came to 8$.  Bagel was barely toasted and both it and the cream cheese tasted worse than the packaged super market stuff.   Starbucks prices for corner store food.   Avoid.<//review>

<Text>I have been coming here since it opened, and it does exactly what a restaurant should do — one thing well with passion. The sandwiches here are some of the best in town, and you can tell there is a brilliant mind in the kitchen behind each combination.

And the coffee is good.< /Text><response>None< /response><user_id>116087949073219043478< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

A neighborhood gem with friendly staff and tasty sandwiches throughout the day. Their pretzel and egg sandwich with chipotle hollandaise is pretty amazing. My only complaint is that they aren't open round the clock and that their breakfast is only served until two.<//review>

My agency ordered sandwiches for our farewell lunch for a Brand Strategist. I must admit, the sandwiches were the talk of the lunch. My sandwich was a 'veggie with mozzarella, on wheat bread, without onions or pickles'. It was simply delicious. I secretly wished that I had two sandwiches instead of one. The only gripe was that the cookies were a bit expensive at $3 per cookie.< /review>

Delicious deli sandwiches at restaurant prices. There’s limited parking so only go if you’re not in a rush and don’t mind waiting for a spot to free up.< /text>

Cool little park. Double tennis court, pretty sizable tree-covered table area, good-sized gazebo, playground, basketball court, and large field. Used to be homeless people coming through, mostly to use bathroom or sit down and rest and get away from sun, but didn't see any the last time I went.< /text>

Not as crowded as the nearby lacy park, eaton blanche offers two playgrounds, smaller one for older kids and larger one for younger kids. The playgrounds are well maintained.

There is also a full court outdoor basketball court, tennis courts, multipurpose field, several picnic tables and bathrooms.<//Review>

Beautiful clean park. It's a medium sized park in my opinion but the jungle gym is large and there are two jungle gyms. My 15month old had a lot of fun. The basketball court finally has their hoops back up. The tennis courts are good and the baseball area is fine. You do need to bring your own plates for the baseball diamond though, which most people do. You also see a lot of people bringing soccer equipment for practices.< /review>

<text>Nice park. Visited in early June '20. Due to "Safer at Home" and social distancing:
- Basketball court has no hoops
- Playground is closed and roped off
- Tennis courts seemed locked, but several tennis players were there

Very open grassy areas. Open (and clean) bathrooms. Plenty of Picnic tables.<//text><rate>4< /rate><resp>None<//resp></record>

The main park itself was crowded but I did go down oneida toward san Pasquale and it was calm! I ate lunch with my friends on the grass. It was relaxing and clean, they had a trash can not that far from us. ((Attached to the park)) great for peaceful quality time!</review>

When i got there. There were several cars just parked in the lot with people on their phones. I took my 2 yr old he had fun on the play ground for a while. Quiet in the actual park. Surrounding the park was active with people.</Review>

<text>Good park. Nice seprate playsets for the small and big kids. Only one full basketball court that is typically busy. Renovated restrooms. Two small parking lots, but tons of street parking on the neighborhood side.</text>< Name>

I enjoy going  every Saturday to Blanche park with Mindy, my mini pin who can't wait to roll in the grass. Also I look forward to watching a fantastic group of soccer players, who are from various ethnicity, it's a a true unity of what America stands for, and I applaud them👏😃<//review>

This park is nice, but there are occasionally  not so pleasant people there. It is not uncommon to see homeless people hanging around or creeps parked by the bathroom. Good park if you're in the neighborhood, but I'd take my little ones elsewhere.</review>

Perfect setting for small parties, the playground for the kids is near the benches and big enough to accommodate an entire party! Only downside is parking as it is a bit small.< /text>

Cool park, Dog Loves it, but this is SoCal, so that means homeless people do too.
Basketball Court, Tennis Courts, multiple picnic areas, two play grounds, multiple open fields, shade trees, in a nice neighborhood. Enjoy!</review>

As I walk into the store the security guard approach me and say the Ace warehouse is close? Im like. "Im going to the market section". He starts to follow me which was very uncomfortable and scary. I had to go back to the store because the cashier forgot to give me my cashback, Again the security stop me and ask me what my business again. I explain and he follow me to the cashier....Cashier apologize and gave me my cashback. The security guard left before that and I saw him let a man to Ace warehouse. So I ask him "You said the Ace warehouse was close" He ignore me like I wasn't there... AVOID THIS STORE! VERY ODD<//review>

I've shopped here in the evening and almost always the cashier has a bad attitude or comes off as rude. Prices are usually higher than nearby grocery stores and their cash registers don't seem to have updated prices. Take a look a your receipt you may be charged more than what is shown on the shelf.< /Review>

First time there wanted to try service and compare prices. Prices we average. Through we are not allowed to bring our own bags I was kindly asks how many I wanted to purchase. I question governor's change of regultions in regards to shopping bags. Cashier indicated they have always charged for the shopping bags. I they don't follow governor's requirements what else are they not following?< /review>

(Translated by Google) Well to begin with, there are not many specials, that is what we look for the 3 best and cheapest stores but I frequent it because of the other thing that is very close to me, the cashiers not at all friendly, all with an attitude not at all cute, that is the worst thing, nobody wants to go to a place And dealing with unkind people is very important to me, kind treatment because I am a person I treat well and when I ask something I like to receive the same thing so I do not like it very much for that reason

(Original)
Bueno para empezar no ay muchas especiales  k es lo k buscamos  las 3 b  ay tiendas mas económicas pero la frecuento por k me queda muy cerca  otra cosa las cajeras  nada amables todas  con una actitud  nada linda eso es lo peor nadie  quiere  ir a un lugar y tratar con personas  nada amable para mi es muy importante el trato amable por k yo soy persona k trato bien y cuando pregunto algo me gusta recibir lo mismo asi es k no me gusta mucho por esa razon</text>

(Translated by Google) Horrible pockets! Very rude and manly. They even look at you ugly when you go shopping. They are not friendly nor do they say thank you or welcome. You ask them something and they speak to you with a very bad attitude. I come here this store because I stay close but if that's the way things are better to walk to another. I miss the Stater Bros

(Original)
Horrible cajeras! De muy mal educación y modales. Hasta te miran feo cuando entras a comprar. No son amables ni tampoco the dicen gracias o bienvenido. Les preguntas algo y te hablan con una actitud a muy mal. Yo venga aquí está tienda porque me quedo cerca pero si así son las cosas más vale caminar a otra. Extraño la Stater Bros< /Review>

I have been bringing my son Robert here for well over 3 years and now my daughter is getting her invisalign. and I have a few more that are going to need braces, but no fear or hesitation I know my kids will be well taken care of at Dr Specht's.  I am very happy with the work done, and the customer service. ALWAYS great people, awesome attitudes, professional, well put together. I can't ever complain. Staff is GREAT! Keep up the GREAT job ladies and gents.</Review>

<review>Today was a good day! We came in today for a braces consultation for my 8 yr old daughter. They were thorough and friendly throughout the office. It turns out that my daughter still has some growing to do and she still has quite a few teeth that still need to come in before anything has to be done and I appreciate Dr. Spechts expertise and his wealth of knowledge. I trust him wholeheartedly with my baby’s smile and should she still need braces once all of her adult teeth grow in, she will be getting them at Central Coast Orthodontics!< /review><user_id>114895886928215933936< /user_id>< pictures>

I wasn't satisfied today. I was trying to make it to my daughters appointment and was running a lil late.  Called to let them know that I was on my way. Spoke to Nallely which wasn't much help. She told me that I wasn't going to be able to be seen even if I arrived. That I would still be reschedule. I am very unhappy because I had to get time off to go to this appointment. Braces aren't cheap and I feel that they should  atleast allow you to be atleast 10 min late due to life does happen and some of us work. I hope Nallely is more considerate and understanding next time for someone else.< /review>

{'time': 1620433844344, 'text': "I am very sorry that we let you down. This is not a normal situation for us, but it has been harder after Covid regulations. We are very strict about our staff health and this occasionally may mean we operate with fewer staff and the same amount of scheduled patients. Combine that with short orthodontic appointments and that makes it harder to give the same level of attention to those on time for appointments, let alone those late. It is our policy to turn away patients 10 or more mins late, but we rarely stick to it. Especially if we are fully staffed and running on time or ahead of schedule. Nallely was only carrying out our policy, because we asked her to reschedule late patients for this busy day. She is an exceptionally amazing employee and we are honored to have her. I hope that we can make it up to you in the future Sandra. Happy Mother's Day weekend to you and hope all is well!"}<//Response>

<Review>I ABSOLUTELY love Central Coast Orthodontics!
I started my treatment 18months ago and
What a difference using Invisalign system.
I’ve wanted straight teeth for 50 years!!
The staff is exceptional!  Friendly,efficient
And work hand in hand with the doctors.
I couldn’t be happier and can’t wait for my next visit

Great office! The employees are all friendly, professional, and efficient. I love the February 2 for 1 retainer deal! It shows they care about your teeth long term! Thanks Dr Specht and Central Coast Orthodontics<//Review>

The first thing I noticed was how beautiful the office was. It was very clean and organized. The receptionist were very friendly and polite. They helped me get checked in quickly. I received an office tour by Kara, who is amazing. She answered all my questions, very professional and put my nerves at ease. Dr. Specht went over my treatment options. He is very knowledgeable and a wonderful doctor. I’m super excited and nervous to embark on this journey, but after my initial meeting I know I’m going to be having great experiences each visit.< /review>

Central Coast Orthodontics is hands down the best ortho. Have always had a great experience. Every step was explained as to what will happen next and all the staff are great and welcoming. Would highly recommend to friends and family.</text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I didn't really have any expectations but when I first time walked in I was actually pretty surprised how comforting they welcome me in. I felt very comfortable around the staff and other orthodontists. The service there is amazing, it doesn't take long for my appointments, and it's a lot more professional compare to how I serve my customers in a sushi restaurant. The people there definitely knew what they're doing. They treat me more than a patient, it's like I see a love of what they do in their jobs. I recommend Central Coast Orthodontics! It's great guys :).</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80ec6c9c46e3abb9:0xa01b367b96190092<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I came in for a consult for Invisalign and my experience was fantastic. The staff was so nice to me and the doctors are knowledgeable and really friendly. I have known Dr. Specht for about 20 years now and He has my trust. I trust him and his staff. Everything is top of the line and very clean.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

By far one of the best, if not the best Orthodontics I've been to. The staff is very polite, and helpful. The Orthodontist themselves are extremely carefully and quick to get the job done. They are very professional.
I went in looking to have my bottom row of teeth straightened and they did an excellent job, no complaints. You can rest assured to be in good hands at Central Cost Orthodontics. I would highly recommend anyone to give them a try.<//Review>

<Review>Central Coast Orthodontist provides an extraordinary experience. Nothing like coming in and being treated like family and be respected, regardless of your age. Outstanding front desk service, there's never been a day I didn't get a joyful greeting. Makes getting your teeth checked up an exciting appointment rather than an annoying one. The staff are true professionals and make sure that everything that's being done to you is informed before, instead of being surprised while in the chair. They listen to criticism well and apply the necessary work in order to get you the perfect smile, your the one that knows your teeth best. The office itself is a work of art, They provide a comfortable waiting area along with magazines to keep you entertained. The service itself, they're always trying to find the new best way to get you your perfect smile in the most convenient way by finding and using state of the art equipment. Overall, my experience here has been nothing but extraordinary. The best part as a patient or guest, when your finished with your appointment, they have a fridge with a variety of ice creams that you can choose. FOR FREE!! What orthodontist does that???? Central Coast Orthodontist keeps up with its generation demands and is always pushing to provide a fun new experience when you come in, like hosting different ruffles and contests through out the year. Central Coast Orthodontist is what the future of Orthodontist should be. Your journey to perfecting your smile should be a non-hustle yet professional experience, not a scary one. Definitely recommend!!< /Review>< Rating>

We came in for our initial exam for my son and liked the office right away!  Everyone was friendly and my son felt welcomed and comfortable.  After the consultation, we decided this is the office we would like to use for orthodontic care for our son.  We came back for the digital scan and are eagerly awaiting his Invisalign aligners that will be coming in soon!  We look forward to spending the next 18 months getting to know the staff as they continue to work with us.  Thank you for a warm and welcoming start!</Review>

<Review>We had our first visit / consultation a week ago and I couldn’t be more pleased with your office. Not only was it clean and easy to find but everyone in that office was so wonderful and friendly. My brother left feeling confident and excited about getting braces, that alone made the visit worth while. Thanks again!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>The staff is friendly. The appointments are quick. My kids get so excited to go due to the fact they get to choose which ice cream they want after each appointment. When starting treatment certain times of the year they give out amazing prizes. Currently they are giving away a car for referrals. Both orthodontists are wonderful.< /review><user>100163447149505323076<//user></record>

Angie,  one of the staff members is so very knowledgeable in everything they do at the office.  I know I can always get my questions answered in a timely,  friendly manner! And they always have fun give aways and contests making it one of the most hopping orthodontists in the SM Valley.< /review>

This place is simply amazing! You will hands down get the best orthodontics care offered. The atmosphere is friendly, professional and welcoming. I seriously feel like I want to be close friends with everybody who works there. They are very accomodating with their scheduling and provide the upmost care and concern when it comes to your dental needs. My teeth are gorgeous and I'm extremely pleased with how efficient and how accurate their services are. I was actually sad to get my braces off...cause I would not be able to see them every month!<//review>

This office is truly one of the best around.  From the awesome Staff right down to the amazing Dr. Specht. This office is fun for the patients but professional at the same time. They treat their patients like family, an experience you leave feeling good about.  Would recommend them to everyone and I do. 😉
P.S. the free ice cream isn't a bad perk either!< /text>

I went here for four years and I really liked it because the staff was always nice to me and after every appointment I got to take ice cream home that they provided. 😋 Once I got my braces off I got a free photo shoot to have my photo put up in their office which was pretty cool.<//Review>

<Review>Each time I come in for my appointments I am promptly greeted. I am signed in by the front desk staff and wait less than 10 minutes to see the dental assistant or see the Dentist. I am happy with their service. I have made several referrals to their office without any benefit to myself. I am happy this office is part of our community.< /Review>< Resp>

<Review>Dr. Spect gave us alternative treatments that other offices did not, specifically a device instead of head gear which my child wouldn't have used. Great customer service and office staff. Usually no (or a very short) wait in the office and this is important to me as a busy mom. My daughter really likes to earn her points and rewards at each visit. We are almost done creating a beautiful smile!< /Review>< rating>

I have been to CCO for brief treatment and always received the best. The doctors truly care about you and the treatment you’re receiving. You walk in and are greeted by friendly smiles from all of the staff. Everyone is kind and makes you feel comfortable here at CCO. The yummy goodies help too! Central coast orthodontics is definitely the best around the area and I would recommend them to everyone!</text>

From the time I walked in and when I was taken to the back I was treated great.  Very professional and I was explained everything until my next appointment.

I was a patient when I had orthodontic treatment a few years ago and when it came time for my son to undergo orthodontic treatment, I had no doubt where I was going to take him. Visits are always pleasant, treatments are progressive and results are amazing. I am confident and trusting in the staff and Orthodontists in this office, they really put their patients first. I would refer them to anyone! And who doesn't like ice cream after every visit?!<//Text>

I am a current and partially new patient at Central Coast Orthodontics. I had my first visit/consultation in October and I remember thinking to myself once I left the office "what a unique ortho office" my first impression was great because I was greeted with kindness and care. I remember being mind blown by all the time and effort the staff have invested on making appointment visits enjoyable. I was surprise to find out about all the commodities they have for us patients such as a photo booth, children play area, washing station and the best part of all FREE ice cream! I honestly felt like a kid again. Without hesitations I can joyfully say I look forward to my appointments. So far I have met Dr. Barrett he is very professional, helpful, and kind....................I highly recommend Central Coast Orthodontics!</Text>

I’ve been a patient at central coast orthodontics for a little over 2 years.
Today is my last official appointment and I can truly say that the experience has been pretty awesome. Gaby for the most part was the one who received and checked me in for 90% of my appointments, and she always did it with the biggest smile.:))</review>

My daughter got her braces tightened & also received her neck gear. The assistant was very through when explaining how to use it & even went as far as having me doing the neck gear & being hands on with it.</Review>

Absolutely in love with the up to date Orthodontic care that our children are provided, and at a reasonable cost.  The value is worth the investment, as my whole family feels confident about the care they are receiving.  It is all executed in a super fun and friendly environment, with welcoming staff and assistants.  The doctors have exceeded expectations and our children love the interaction.</Review>

<Review>From the time I walked in and when I was taken to the back I was treated great.  Very professional and I was explained everything until my next appointment.  The orthodontist was awesome as well as the dental assistants. They always see you when your appointment is scheduled which I love highly recommend this place 👄< /Review>< time>

I'm currently a patient at Central Coast Orthodontics, and it was not hard to pick this place to do my braces. You're always greeted with a warm welcoming smile. The staff is awesome and makes scheduling appointments easy. Their office is fun and unique. They have a board that they write your name on if it's your first day and it lights up. It's a awesome way to be welcomed. Not to mention free ice cream after every visit. Plus some cool prizes and giveaways. I highly recommend Central Coast Orthodontics, I always look forward to coming to my appointments!</text>

<Text>Central Coast Orthodonics is great. First impression was that the place was so clean and welcoming. We took a tour around the office on our first visit and were introduced to the staff. We talked about what our initial goal was with the treatment. It was an easy decision on this office after searching a few places. My daughter is now close to being done on her treatment with braces and we are very impressed on both doctors who are very detailed with their work. My daughter can be picky and the doctors focused on small details that she was concerned about to ensure that her smile was great. The receptionist, Gaby, was helpful when it came to scheduling appointments around our busy schedule. I felt comfortable with letting my daughter in on her own and working all of that out with the help of the receptionist. Great place over all. Definitely recommended.</Text>< pics>

This by far one of the best orthodontics in Santa Maria. The receptionist Gaby was very helpful and informative, when asked questions about insurance coverage and future appointments. The DA Ramon is incredibly friendly and makes you feel comfortable. You won’t be dreading youe next ortho/dental appointment anymore.</review>

I was a transfer to Dr. Specht and it was a flawless transfer honestly. I came just to see and signed up that day! I am so thankful. My appointments were timely and I was always informed of my status and tips for car in a way that ANY patient would understand. Trust me, you can trust this office! #adultwithbraces #NOMOREBRACES<//Review>

<Name>Angelina J</Name><rate>5</rate><review>My daughter has just had her braces put on at Dr. Spect and Dr. Barrett's office. She is the first in our family to have braces! She is 12 and filled with questions. I love that the staff is so supportive and patient with everything. It is always a joy to come into the office, everyone is always friendly and happy. I love the incentives they give the children to keep up on their grades and dental hygiene. Dr Spect has been popular since I was back in early college, I am thankful he is here still on the central coast so I can take my daughter to him for straight teeth. I know she will have a more beautiful smile when she is done with her braces!< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The staff is very welcoming and friendly. They Fill the room up with comfort and hospitality. The doctors go out of their way to make me feel special and comfortable. By far the best Ortho I've ever been too. I highly recommend the invisiline! I'm about to be finished with my treatment and I use to be shy to smile, but now I have people telling me "your teeth look great"! I'm so very grateful for central coast orthodontics.</Text>< pictures>

I'm very happy that I decided to get my Invisalign treatment at Central Coast Orthodontics. Dr. Specht and the entire crew are amazing at what they do! They always make my visits special by asking me how I am and how my treatment is going.  I enjoy being greeted by everyone their. Not only do they have amazing gifts that they give you when you first start your treatment, you also walk out with some free ice cream with every visit! Overall the staff is what makes this place so incredible. They really care about their patients and do their best to make them happy. I don't think I've ever been to any other dentist or orthodontics with such an awesome staff and a great environment. Central Coast Orthodontics is the best!</Review>

The staff at Central Coast Orthodontics (Dr. Specht & Dr. Barrett) is so friendly! It's genuine!  I didn't feel like they were just trying to get my business, I truly felt like I mattered! They explained everything thoroughly and made me feel welcome and at home! I will always refer people to this office!< /text>

I recently began treatment at Dr. Spechts office. Both the Doctors are incredibly knowledgeable and great to work with. The friendly dental staff from the ever so helpful and bubbly Gaby at the front desk to every assistant, hygienist and technician in the office make it for a great experience when going to the dentist. Wouldn't recommend anywhere else!</Review>

<Review>Best experience ever! The staff, doctors and facility are amazing. I took my niece here, and the doctors took really good care of her. I'm forever thankful for the help and the caring they did for her.
The ice cream for the patient and her party, yum! I love ice cream. Coffee as I waited for her appointment to be done! Yes please, thank you and the celebration they did on her last visit to take her braces out, what a nice touch. They spoiled her and that made me happy. The little touches to show their appreciation means a lot. I have never been to a office that felt welcoming. Thank you doctors and staff for everything. May God Bless You All.

I just can't say enough about Dr. Spect and his amazing, friendly and very good looking staff!!  My son had his braces put on and from the time we walked in the door they made him feel so comfortable and they just encouraged him and made him feel so special! Especially Kara! She is not only beautiful and friendly but she always had a way of making my son laugh! I thought he would be nervous but she made him feel like he was with friends which made me relaxed and so we knew that we were in the right place! He loved the free ice cream after every appointment and I loved the customer service that more than exceeded our expectations! If you are looking for a place to go for braces...go see Dr. Spect!  Top notch all the way!!< /Review>

Dr Specht and Dr Barrett are AMAZING! I am an adult wearing braces for the 3rd time in my life with suggestion of my Peridontist. From the beginning they have explained every process in complete detail and if I ever had any questions about treatment, they were prompt to attend me to answer them. They offer an affordable payment plan being a cash pay patient and the billing staff is great to work with.  From the time you step foot into the office, the front desk gals quickly remember who you are and check you in. The back office staff of wonderful in taking their time and making sure you're comfortable during adjustments.  They are all very caring and kind. The office is immaculately clean and they even have an awesome ice cream freezer for you to have a complimentary ice cream when you leave!  Appointments are very convenient and you don't have to wait weeks when having an issue with your braces to get seem. I would HIGHLY recommend this practice to anyone looking to get Orthodontic treatment and can promise you won't be disappointed in your care and end results!</Text>

<review>It's rare you walk into a place and think, wow I would love to work here. That's the friendly, fun and exciting atmosphere they give off! When you walk in you're greeted right away by beautiful, happy smiling faces. They walk you through checking in and you have a seat. The wait time is always short and they are always well staffed! All of this isn't even my favorite part...
What is so cool about this place are the incentives they give children to stay up on the things they are supposed to do.. they have an app called "the Hub" that the kids can accrue points on when they do certain things, like: a's on report card, cleanings at the dentist, coming to appointments, etc. my daughter has never been so excited to keep her teeth clean but now knowing those points turn into gift cards when she wants to turn them in... I've scene a difference. Such a great way to get kids on board with all of this (because she wasn't very excited).
Another awesome touch is the ice cream at the end. It isn't really about the ice cream per se to me but the excitement that they're getting a special treat and keeping these appointments upbeat and positive. My daughter feels like it's a special treat to walk into CCO and I hope this leads her to keep having a healthy and positive attitude when it comes to the dentist office.
I haven't even gotten to the actual medical stuff yet.. we have talk to other orthos that just kept telling me to wait.. wait.. wait. But the difference with Central Coast Ortho and the other offices are the depth of the initial consultation. Central Coast Ortho took pictures of my daughters profile, they took x rays and did a full exam. They were able to see some concerning issues that are not just cosmetic and could affect the future of her permanent front teeth. If I kept waiting and didn't get the consult from CCO I could very much be dealing with a much scarier issue when my daughter got older.
They presented me with all my options for her age.. they offer in house payment plans which make this journey a lot more feasible and they often have a monthly giveaway when you start up (my daughter got an iPad!- but this changes monthly)
If you're on the fence about what you should do with a child- or your own because they have adult patients too, I suggest going in and just talking to them. The first consult is free and you really have nothing to lose.</review><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

I came to see Dr. Specht for removal of an old permanent retainer and replacing it with a removable one. The entire experience was great--from calling to schedule, to being greeted when I walked in the office--everyone I encountered was friendly. Kara helped remove the retainer and the process was quick and painless. Dr. Specht was extremely personable and made me feel like I was the only person in the office (even though there were a myriad of other patients in the treatment area). The visit was quick, efficient, accomplished my goal, and didn't break the bank. I would recommend this practice to anyone in need of orthodontic work.<//Text>

They always make my visits special by asking me how I am and how my treatment is going.  I enjoy being greeted by everyone their. Not only do they have amazing gifts that they give you when you first start your treatment, you also walk out with some free ice cream with every visit! Overall the staff is what makes this place so incredible. They really care about their patients and do their best to make them happy. I don't think I've ever been to any other dentist or orthodontics with such an awesome staff and a great environment.

I highly recommend Dr. Spechts office. I did not encounter Dr. Specht himself, only his amazing staff. I went there to get new retainers when mine broke prematurely (made by a different Orthodontist, a few years ago). I actually switched Orthodontics because of Violeta, she is so kind and treats me like family. The rest of the staff are also amazing and I very much enjoyed the complimentary ice cream 😍. P.S. to whoever selects the ice cream, you're amazing!< /Review>

The staff at Central Coast Orthodontics (Dr. Specht & Dr. Barrett) is so friendly! It's genuine!  I didn't feel like they were just trying to get my business, I truly felt like I mattered! They explained everything thoroughly and made me feel welcome and at home! I will always refer people to this office!</Text>

I love central coast orthodontics, I was honestly unsure if I wanted braces or Invisalign and they informed me of my options and were extremely efficient in the whole process of my Invisalign. Typically, orthodontists have their patients change their trays every two weeks but Central Coast Orthodonitics let you change them weekly and it speeds up the whole process and hurts less with each tray. You also get a photo shoot at the end and they track your progress with pictures. Overall I love going to the dentist and that’s a first!</review>

<review>The nervous feelings go away the minute you are greeting at the front desk. The information you receive regarding your treatment also puts you at ease knowing you are in the hands of compassionate professionals.  The equipment is state of the art, and to this day, nothing ever caused me pain!  I am 10 weeks into treatment with my invisaline and it is amazing how quick the progress has been. I have a unique situation with needing a temporary fix needed with my invisalines, and the first batch gave me some trouble, but the staff was quick to remedy the situation when I came in for my second batch.  Aside from that, my experience has been the best ever! I can not wait to get my daughter started with hers< /review>< pictures>

My coworkers and I visited Central Coast Orthodontics a few months ago. I had already been in contact with one of their employees. From the moment I met Elizabeth we literally just clicked... as soon as we parked and walked into the buiding Elizabeth had already been waiting for us outside. She welcomed us with open arms and the look on my coworkers face was as if they've known her for years. As soon as you walk into their office everyone is so welcoming and always asking if you need anything. Dr Spect himself is just all around awesome! It's no wonder their patients love the staff and doctor! They're just beyond GREAT! I'm from Los Angeles and if anyone asked me for a recommendation of an Ortho in Santa Maria -- I without a doubt recommend Central Coast Orthodontics!< /review>

I ABSOLUTELY love Dr Spechts Office. All of there crew members are always so friendly and helpful. Dr Specht and Dr Barrett have the best bed side manners. My daughter who was VERY scared and skeptical about getting braces but they put all her worries to rest and she LOVES the free ice cream after (what kid wouldnt). I would defiantly recomend them to everyone i know. Thank you for being so amazing!!< /text>

Central Coast Orthodontics rocks from the moment you walk in the door until you step out... the women in the front are always so welcoming and quick to check you in, I have never waited for longer than 10 minutes, EVERY dental assistant is caring, gentle with my usually nervois 9 year old, and thorough with their explanations. My daughter still talks about how awesome Kara is even though she has her braces off. Dr. Spect and Dr. Barrett are calming, very friendly, and professional. Also, the choice of icecream each visit is pretty cool to 😉

Both my 9 year old daughter has completed phase 1 and I am in the middle of my Invisalign treatment.<//Text>

Thank you for telling us about your experience

Your Review:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We met Dr. Specht after having consulted 2 other area orthodontists regarding my daughter's need for ortho treatment. I felt that the other orthos made a rush to judgment about removing 4 of my daughter's adult teeth immediately and then beginning treatment. Dr. Specht felt that we should wait until she'd lost all her baby teeth in order to determine if the removal of 4 adult teeth would indeed be necessary prior to applying braces. He saw her at regular intervals at no charge for almost 2 years before she lost all of her baby teeth. And guess what? It turned out that with just the baby teeth gone... there was enough room in her mouth to accommodate ALL of her adult teeth. Voila! Good call Dr. Specht! Your patience and good judgment paid off on Delilah's behalf!! We love the care and service we've received from you and your staff from beginning to end. Delilah will soon be getting her braces off and her teeth look BEAUTIFUL!!!<//Text>

I have two sons currently in Invisalign at Central Coast Orthodontics with Dr. Specht. I was absolutely blown away by their kindness at our consult appointment. The front office is so happy to see you when you walk in.  I'm not kidding when I say that every single person that we have come in contact with at their office, has treated us with warmth and greets us with a smile on the their face. My kids love it here as well. The environment is welcoming and fun. They are always having contests and prizes and have fun things going on at the office. We got treated to a full Taco bar on Cinco De Mayo. Of course my kids would say that their favorite part was getting free iPads when they started their Invisalign. (That was the promotion going on at that time but they always change it up.) They also get to choose an ice cream from the ice cream bar at every visit when they leave. Most important to me is the the doctors are knowledgeable and really help you to understand all your options and make you feel so comfortable as well as the kids. I highly recommend this office to anyone looking to improve their smile. You will not be disappointed coming here!!!< /review>

(Translated by Google) It is a truly pleasant experience when all the staff at the complex treat you in a kind and friendly way, who are greeting and willing to explain the information and answer your questions. The two times I have been to Central Coast Orthodontics I have been satisfied and happy with the excellent service. The place is also very clean and they are very well organized. 👍🏻👌🏼👏🏼
