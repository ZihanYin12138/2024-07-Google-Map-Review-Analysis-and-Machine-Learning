I always get the best service when I come here. The prices are always reasonable and the staff is so friendly and helpful. I just recently purchased new tires and got a full tune up on my car and the pricing was very affordable. Everything came out great and my car is running like new. I would recommend this family owned business to anyone. You won't regret it!</text>

<review>DO NOT GO HERE

I went here to get my a/c checked, they told me I needed a new condenser and fan assembly and everything (including labor) was gunna cost about $670. The manager himself told me he ordered the parts and I can come Monday to drop my car off. Came Monday, their mechanic didn’t come into work...now I had to wait till Thursday. Came in Thursday, I got a call later in the day saying my condenser needed to be ordered lol the best part, the manager called me and ASKED ME how much he quoted me lol these guys don’t know what they’re doing. Save your time, find another shop< /review>< Pics>

Worse shop in town to go to. They'll break things on
car and say they'll fix it but bring the car in another day is the trick they'll say to avoid solving the problem. Does it take more then 1 day to keep coming up with excuses. Made contact  with them over the phone twice since  i went in twice talking them wasting my time. Excuses were coming up each day with sorry we're we're short on workers or our mechanic isn't in today. Need better service, experienced workers and better management.<//text>

<Review>I came here to get my tires not too long ago and I left pleased with the service that I was given. The owner was happily able to help me find sport tires at a reasonable price and the job installation was quick. Other than tires you can order many different kinds of product too from flashy rims to suspension kits, this place does it all! I recommend anyone to try this place out and for sure I'll be coming here next time I need any tires for my z34.</Review><Rate>5<//Rate><gmap_id>0x80db6f34cd0af69f:0x1abc24c14c95f4ad<//gmap_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Called to ask if they were busy and they said that they weren't. Just needed a simple patch done on my lunch break he said we'll take care of it right away just bring the wheel to the Bay. I waited for 10 minutes no one even acknowledged I was there so they lost my business and I was even going to buy a new tire</text>

<review>Horrible service,. I took my sister in to get a used tire,.  They put a bad one on, .We xallecthe next day letting them know that the used tire they put on her car is going to explode at any minute and it's unsafe.....   They proceeded to tell us there is no warranty under used tires.....   (. All that's fine and understandable).   But it's illegal to sell unsafe used tires and they refuse to make this situation right!!!!!< /review>< resp>

Don't let the exterior mislead you, the staff is friendly, service is prompt, and the pricing is highly competitive if not the lowest</Review>

(Translated by Google) .very helpful and friendly and very good prices to buy new tires, and if you have an air tire low they put air on you and check the others so that the 4 are the same, each one and personally I have never been charged and they are very friendly I recommend that tire nte

(Original)
.uy serviciales y amables y muy buenos precios para comprar llantas nuevas, y si tienes baja una llanta de aire ellos te le ponen aire y te chequean las demás para que las 4 estén igual ,cada que yo e ido en lo personal nunca me an cobrado y son muy amables les recomiendo esa llantera 💯< /review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Very bad service to the clinte. I put 100,000-mile tires that did not last 30,000 says that because I never rotated or aligned, although I had proof that each oil change rotated and aligned them. He did not want to or try to call because with tests it is easier. Do not buy here. The guarantees are not valid. Go to a prestigious place because cheap is expensive.

(Original)
Muy mal servicio al clinte. Le puse llantas de 100,000 millas no duraron ni 30,000 dice que porque nunca las rote ni hice alinamiento aunque yo tenia prubas de que cada cambio de aceite las rotaba y las Aliniaba. No quizo ni intentar de llamar pues con prubas es mas facil. No compren aqui. Las garantías no valen. Vayan a un lugar con prestigio porque lo barato sale caro.</review>

<text>Went there on a Friday evening. Open indoors. Very spacious and welcoming. For the area, they had a good craft beer selection on draft and in cans. Beertender was nice and attentive. Bands are also playing there. Overall, I recommend going here.< /text><user_name>Jerome Melgar</user_name><Response>None< /Response>< rating>

Stopped by for a night cap after dinner at nearby restaurant. Bartender was friendly, beer selection was good and reasonably priced. Giving it a good review as it quenched the thirst and made for a great end of the evening. If you are looking for a cold beer on a Saturday night in Exeter, I say give this place a go.</text>

<text>Been here a few times and I enjoy every time. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. Not the biggest beer selection, but they do have a few different ones I haven't tried before. I think it's great that Exeter has a place like this.

Update 9/7/19: I am happy to say they have improved their beer selection 😁.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Exeter's newest on sale beer and wine license. A friendly, open, little place. The proprietors here should have no trouble winning a popularity contest with their only downtown competition, The Stag. The Stag has recently been sold into new ownership and THAT guy has delivered a horrible ambiance to that bar.<//text>

This location has been closed for regular on-premise service since March of last year and our brewers do their best to provide to-go beers and wine while juggling other tasks. Was this something you experienced prior to shelter in place?\n\nWe'd love to make it up to you. Please visit any of our San Francisco locations in Lower Haight, Mission Dolores, Russian Hill or Outer Sunset."}< /Resp>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Hidden gem in the middle of the Bay Bridge. Woods Island Club is great for groups or just yourself - no need to reserve a table if you get here early. The beers are fantastic and they serve pizza and empanadas. On a sunny day, bring sunscreen since there isn’t any shade. Beautiful bay views and great vibes.<//Review>< Pics>

Very cool brewery on TI. Sandy reservable space with picnic tables. Bring your own food. Buy your booze in the brewery.< /text>

Great spot for those Indian summer days. Beer is quite good, and they make their own wine as well. If only they had more food options, but the empanadas they do have are pretty good if you’re hungry or need something to soak up the beers

Solid spot to bring kids - they bury gold coins in the beach sand, and give out otter pops if you collect enough coins. Fun for at least a good 45 minutes!</Review>

Easy 5 stars because they let me use there bathroom even though that meant outfitting both me and my daughter with wrist bands just to get to it. Looks like a pretty cool brewery setup in an old hanger with a massive sand patio that's sits staring at the new Bay Bridge. Cool spot. I'll be back when in able to properly partake.< /Text>

They had definitely a beach vibe going with a nice sand pit, beach chairs, and some chill music.  Views of the Bay Bridge under the warm Treasure Island sun with almost no wind is magical.  Beer was decent can't complain wish we had more food options will be back on another Sunday funday!</text>< Pictures>

Great beers, great views. Wonderful to watch the sailboats going in and out of clipper Cove. And reasonable prices. Plus you can take your shoes off and walk in the sand. Too bad they aren’t open till sunset???</review>

This spot speaks for itself. From the beautiful views of the Bay Bridge to the ample seating they provide outside.

The staff is very friendly and always willing to let you try the beers before you commit.

From Freezie Pop to Local Honey, Woods beer offers a wide variety of choices for very beer lovers palate.

Nestled in the very cozy area of Treasure Island, this place is a treasure in itself that caters to the beer lovers taste, and also offers empanadas!

Delicious, flaky South American style pastries that are hot and full of delicious ingredients that vary from beef to ham and cheese!< /Text>

<Review>Cool reason to stop on Treasure Island. Warehouse with several beers on tap and large “beach” to enjoy your drink, and actual warm weather, with unobstructed views of the new Bay Bridge span and SF to the west. Pale ale was good. Near 25 bus.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

The "beach" is great! The beer is not to my liking, to many infusions and flavor combos. The empanadas are a great food offering except they​ run out in 5 min so if your not the first few people in line you'll be lucky to get one.<//Review>

If I can give -5 starts, I would. After waiting patiently in line for 25 mins, 2 people serving a line of 40-50 people. No problem at all. I order my food, which was a slice of pizza for $7. They told me it would be 5 mins to warm up. After waiting 5 mins, they finally put my pizza in to warm because they started taking people’s orders after me. When I asked them nicely again, they said they are putting it in. Once they did, I saw the man was putting this terrible frozen pizza slice, the size of a soda can. After another 10 mins of my pizza being warmed up, the man was complaining it’s a very small slice to his co-workers. Then, when they finally gave me the slice, (20 mins after placing my order) the slice was burnt. The server should’ve had some common sense not to give me a burnt slice of small pizza. I told them I didn’t want that and I’ll just have an empanada, which is $1 cheaper. The server yelled at me and slammed the pizza slice. Walked over to get me an empanada and said threatened me to get out. Then in his imagination somehow, he said I cursed them out. I was literally shocked I stood frozen there because I was so confused. He walked around the counter to me and got up in my face, and said you should never complain about your food to a server. And yelled at me again. He is so lucky that I was there for a birthday party and held my composure. Otherwise, he would’ve definitely seen what I’ve been learning in boxing and mma class for the last 15 years. Disgusting worker. The other 2 gentleman were very kind. The one Hispanic piece of no good is gonna catch it next time.<//text>

I do a lot of food delivery and I've noticed a lot of the fast food chains including Jack in the box are very rude workers and even rude managers the worst one I've ever experienced is Taco Bell on Escondido boulevard in Escondido manager completely rude.< /review>

It's JitB, there's not much to say that everyone doesn't already know. What I can say is the staff at this location is always polite and go above and beyond to make sure your order is right, and if something does go wrong, they fix it.< /text>

Customer service was great. It was on Sep 9th when I went there; while I was waiting in the drive-thru I noticed that when the customer in front me got to the window she started to complain about something that happened in her previous visit. She was mad and when the employees gave her the food through the window she dropped the bag; same thing happened with the drinks. She left a mess in the floor. Apparently this w lady argued that it was the employee's fault; but it was evident that she did it on purpose. Hopefully she is banned from going to this Jack in the Box.<//Text>

Yummy. I like to get food for two or three meals so I don't have to stop more than once a day. I always get a burger, a chicken club salad and a home style breakfast. The breakfast heats up beautifully</Text>

This place will always be polite, fast and generous with their service. The food always tastes great as well as it doesn't have too much of anything but also not too little either. When I go in through the drive through at midnight I order the chicken tater meld and by far this place makes it the best with the super oozy cheese.

Employees prefer talking than helping customers.  If the talking was work related it would be fine. But fat shaming a customer in Spanish is totally not cool.  Of course the food is great but the abiance was not.< /text>

<review>I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I ordered  two tacos an five mini churros. The tacos are like always, perfect with ranch. The churros have a lot of cinnamon sugar which is delicious. I highly recommend the churros because they have some incredible filling. I will be back here whenever I am in the area and want fast food.< /review><Time>1548052105171<//Time><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

It's okay place if your hungry and in a hurry decent okay food , I just think some of the employees have been there a very long time as in years not months and some have attitudes and are ungrateful they should be happy they have jobs but I would not ever work there,there's  better opportunities in different industries  I just eat there twice a month I rather cook at home.<//Text>

Napkin holder was out. They give you a number to set at your table,however they make you come and get your own food at the front counter. The guy cleaning tables is just using a napkin and rubbing food all over the tables and calling it clean. Then went without cleaning his hands working with food and even touching the French frys. Yuck!! Needs a mop!!! What has happened to jack in the box. There is no pride in work any more and not customer service.....</review>< pics>

Have always loved Jack in the Box. Best is the Jack's Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich w/ cheese, side of curly fries and buttermilk to dip.  Healthy by no means but 100% delicious.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Today we went to this establishment and the staff who had contact with the food did not have the health care that is established, they touched the money and touched the food, and the mask was not used correctly, and the bathrooms did not let us use it despite the fact that it was an emergency very bad service

I have been to many CVS locations and the staff  here at this CVS is by far the best customer service I have received at any drug store go to quick stop. Not only are they open 24/7, at a undesirable location and in constant chaos from fellow neighbors but they always are happy to help you with anything. Always pleasant. Never rude to anyone whether you have $$ or not. Someone at this store is doing it right and it trickles down. U guys are awesome and very much appreciated. Thank you for real.</review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>It’s a solid 24-7 CVS though the prices can run ridiculously high for food items. Pharmacy is open until 9pm which makes it great. It shares a parking lot with Jack in the Box and while there is a constant loitering problem outside, they don’t seem to mess with customers rather they are just in the area. I would feel safe being there till 2am but for those in more targeted groups I would just park close to the front door.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Walked in and wasn't greated or acknowledged by any of the three associates nearby one at the door. I asked where the restroom was located. We don't have one was the answer I received. Ok is there a reason or one near by... not for public use and I don't know are the responses I received homeless hanging around not exactly safe. Rude and unhelpful the jack in the box next door does have restrooms by the way.< /Review>

<Review>Went here for my COVID-19 vaccine. From booking the appointment to check-in to leaving after the timed 15 minutes, the whole process was very efficient! Gave sufficient information, instructions and reminders prior to appointment. Friendly staff, no wait times, answered all questions patiently, very organized. Clear stations and directions. Congrats to the team there! Best CVS service ever! Thank you for everything you do!< /Review>< rate>

<Text>Since their quality of work was outstanding, I strongly recommend the drug store. I feel like all the medications were new. They also promise to bring drugs to your home free of charge. For my variable timetable, the decision to pick up & deliver was outstanding. For this most useful facility, thank you!<//Text>< rate>

Security informed me that I had to leave my Cannondale synapse road bike by the door and assured me they would watch it. Less than two minutes later as I was finishing my transaction at the self checkout kiosk an employee slowly approached me and quietly informed me that she thinks somebody just stole my bike. After losing the foot race against my bike I went back into the store to be offered no assistance, rather I was ignored. After a couple minutes of this I raised my voice to make sure I was being heard and was sarcastically told I could call the police if it would make me feel better and that I needed to leave because I was distracting the zero other customers in the vicinity
So I'm out over $8,000 at their proposal to watch my bike that they won't watch or make a sound as its being stolen

Amazing customer service.</text>

When I had a cough, I went to the drug store to purchase medicine. The pharmacist was very welcoming and knowledgeable about all the medicine, especially that was good for my cough. I really liked the place and all of their staff. They really implement proper procedures and guidelines in their store. They had prompt service. Pleasant and clean place!<//Text>

They follow you around wondering if you are thief. They refuse to help you when anything wrong with the transaction. You can see that from their face -- "come on,  just leave the store and make my life easier today. I don't want to deal with issues." Super rude employee and they don't care about the customers. Never come to this place again and it smells bad outside and you might step on s**t. Just go to another CVS if you want to be treated like a real customer.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I was worrying the other day that the medication I wanted would be prohibitively expensive. This pharmacy, fortunately, stocks a wide range of medications. A pharmacist thanks you from the bottom of his heart.<//Review>

I came for a daily 3, asked for help. She said , she doesn’t know how to do it. And no available at the counter . She said, only available on the machine .
To me, she one of the supervisors here, but she doesn’t care and provide bad customers experience to me. If I can do with the machine. I won’t asked her favor.  But because they put the noted “No touch screen” . I don’t feel to go back this’s CVS again. She show one kind of look .
I’m not sure many people might have bad experience with this’s CVS here .

I hope the management may reconsider about the customers again.
Thank you<//Text>

They were well stocked with whatever you need but they would not let me use the restroom because of the managers policy. No explanation even though I spent $32 there.  It's a shame but u can't let one bad apple spoil the bunch. I am a Navy veteran who served my country and yet they wouldn't let me use the bathroom where I spent my hard earned money. I definitely won't be back to this location.</text>

<review>Pretty sketchy on the outside with a lot of homeless people that heckle you, but good location. The pharmacy is super slow. I always go to my doctor who calls in medication and then go to the CVS about 5 hours later. It’s never ready when I get there and they always have “to verify.” So I always end up waiting.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Dear CVS,

I run a small business out of my lovely, yet tiny, apartment in Echo Park.
It's not that I can't afford a printer or a shredder.  It's just that I don't find them attractive.
To be honest; I don't use one often enough to warrant setting-up an alter to one.
Am I alone in this?
I rarely need one for my business - mostly small personal tasks which I do on evenings or weekends WHEN OUR LOCAL PRINT SHOP IS CLOSED!.

Our nearest print shop is E R COPIES on Sunset. (No! They Don't have a parking lot).

To be clear: I'm not trying to encourage a big company like yours to compete with a small company like ER Copies.
I just don't believe they want my business.
I think they see themselves as a print shop for the artists and writers in the area.
They don't seem to like performing small tasks.   Like my order of 4 copies.

Rates for my small task (at ER Copies) are .50 cent each - nothing fancy.  This rate is per sheet of black ink on white sheet, standard paper.
I've never requested color.  I'm sure that would be more.
Honestly, for the convenience of not having to spend an hour in my car (there and back) to drive to the nearest safe alternative in Hollywood (Fedex-Kinko's). I really don't mind paying!  I just wish there was someone who had better hours (LIKE YOU - "hint").  And since I am paying .50 cents per sheet: I wish it was to someone who, actually appreciated my business (LIKE YOU - "hint")

Hopefully your future print customer.
~Michelle

Why only 2 stars?  Honestly; I didn't think you would read a 5 star review.
Also; I found no way to email you directly.  Sure, I saw the number, but I'm more of a spell it out kind of person.  In conversation; I would have left out something important then dwelled on it all day.  Who needs that?

Once you respond to me.  I will adjust the rating.
Or, maybe just leave the rating low.   And simply say...
PRINT SHOP NOT OPEN YET :(
Lord bless your business!< /Text><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Great customer service! Most staff always ready to help, Martha is always greeting with such positive attitude, eager to help every customer that walks in, she makes shopping at this location so much smoothly due of the high traffic of customers they get because of the location. And the managers are great help as well! This store is my favorite of all the CVS locations in downtown LA.< /Review>< pictures>

I asked to speak with a Manager at one of the counters and Natalie, said she was the Shift Supervisor.. She listened attentively to what had transpired at the other CVS store and expressed concerns about the manner in which that Shift Supervisor had handled the situation. Ms. Natalie is an excellent example of the type of Supervisors that CVS must continue to employ to continue to be competitive. Natalie is very pleasant,knowledgeable, an excellent listener, a problem solver, and most of all, one who has great customer service skills.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

It is good way to stop by if you happend to meet someone in the area, there's a lot of parking space in this CVS.  It only share parking with Jack in the Box.  I don't there's time limit but there's a security guard there.  So double check to insure the time limit to avoid getting toll< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

If it's your policy to inconvenience me while shopping, then I will make it a point never to shop at this CVS or any other CVS.

<Review>Nestled right between the 110/101 freeways as well as Dodger Stadium + Downtown LA, this location is a fairly convenient stopping point especially since it has its own parking lot + self-checkout stations for when there's a long line. And yes, fairly frequently there is a line of at least 5 customers despite 2-3 employees working the registers.

I only come to this particular CVS location on Sunset due to its proximity to my stomping grounds. It's just your typical 24-hour CVS where you can get all your basic toiletries, stationary, makeup, snacks, holiday cards, alcohol, medication, etc at any time of day or night. The photo station is right next to the cash registers, + the pharmacy is in the back. They tend to be pretty good about keeping things pretty well-stocked so I've never had a problem finding anything even if it's on sale in the weekly ads.

The 3-stars is a stamp of mediocrity. On one particular visit, this store sold my roommate SPOILED MILK + so ever since then, I've questioned what monkey business goes on in the backroom as to how this could have happened... but most other experiences have been uneventful. Be wary of the bums hanging out outside the store. The fact that they have a security guy here is a sign of the type of characters that also visit this location.< /Review>< Pics>

Cashier didn't bother helping me much when I needed something & she just gave up on me. I'd hoped for a better customer experience.<//Text>

< review>
Today at CVS/pharmacy the two males security (vss security) guards was Racially Profiling Costumers , were "routinely" directed, among other things, to "follow that white girl" without any evidence that a shopper is going to steal anything, while at least one supervisor "would never give such directions with regard to a hispanic shoppers." Looks like they are “constantly required to endure the use of racial slurs by their superiors and store manager".

CVS/pharmacy is committed to treating all of their customers with dignity and respect. If they're committed to treating all of their customers with dignity and respect, we feel they should have a zero tolerance level for discrimination.

We put back the items right away then step out, Mexican young guy working there doesn't care about customer, He never think NO customer = No Job,

This is a decent CVS location. During Dodgers games the parking lot can get crowded because people are getting beer. There are always many homeless people around asking for change. The other day I saw some homeless people stealing bottle of liquor from the CVS locations and they were drinking outside.</Review>

She wasn't helpful she didn't understand that you can use different coupons even if they are not identical coupons but were correct coupons for the product I was taking. FYI you can use home printed and png coupon cutouts as long as you don't use more than 4 for one given product! Ive never had this issue at any other cvs. All you have to do is an override!!! Very dissapointed.</Text>< date>

I would definitely come back! Great service and attentive staff. Food was good. Pho broth was very refreshing and it hit the spot. I am super picky with broth and this place did good.< /review>

Not very clean. Cloth covered seats...some were dirty. Owner should invest in cleaning those seats! Service was average. Dishes we ordered were average.<//Review>

This is my second time coming here and theyre still slow made us wait for good 30-40min to bring our food out. We didn’t even get our drinks until like what...half way done with our food (cough) they didn’t even serve us water. Like honestly bruh can we at least get water first then our drink. Like what’s the point of ordering drinks when it comes at the end of the meal. So disappointing. Wouldn’t recommend anyone to here< /Review>< pics>

Good pho. Portion size has been reduced I noticed. Went for bahn mi sandwiches and was good too. Although it would be good if they had spicier options as their jalapenos is not spicy enough for me. I think their pickled jalapenos in their jar on the tables is hotter than the fresh one serve in the sandwiches. Other than that u would have to put Sriracha sauce for spicyness. Too bad no thai chili options to put in there hott.  Besides that it's good for take out and dine in especially when it's raining seasons. Would go back again.< /text>

Overall the pho broth was very good and service was awesome too. My only suggestion is use better quality noodles.< /review>

<Text>Ordered chicken with rice plate and a large  #12 rare steak with noodles and came ouT to $28! Now I wouldn’t mind but the #12 was smaller than a small and wife finished it in 5 min,  Now my wife is small and doesn’t eat a lot. What a rip off, I understand it’s a pandemic and might be saving food supply to serve all customers... but cmon. Never going back.<//Text>< Rate>

I’ve been to this place a couple of times.

The more I come to this place, the more it gets worse.

Their food is fine, it’s the maintenance. Their restroom is gross and looks like it’s never been cleaned before. They even Forgot to give me my order. The waiter that served us didn’t even care to say sorry when he gave the receipt. I’m not asking for much. They should already know what to do...</Text>

Fox news... And really any news... is very unpleasant while trying to eat a nice meal. The food and atmosphere is so lovely, I don't understand why they have to play the news. My God daughter saw news of people rioting and got scared and we had to go home.<//Text>

I went on a weekday during lunch hour and it wasn’t too busy. The service was great and the food was delicious. Lots of options for Vietnamese dishes, eggs rolls, offering pho, platters etc...</Review>

Great place.  I have had a hard time finding a place that made some of my favorites well.
-Calamari
-Spare ribs
-Salted Lemonade
The Pho is good, but the sides are much better!< /text>

The waitress was very informative. She explained what everything was and how to properly eat our chosen plates. The food was yummy and fresh. They even have " miracle noodles" for people on low carb diets. It's the excellent service that will definetly make me go back, even if it is on the other side of town from me. Thank you for the lovely experience.< /Review>

Place closes at 10 pm. We arrived around 915 pm. Right from the get go you can see the employees were dreading about having more customers. It was an akward situation so we hurried up and ordered. Our food came out in such small portions compared to the many times we have came here. We paid dinner prices for lunch portions. That night my family had never ate dinner so fast. We couldn't wait to leave. As other customers entered, one of the waiters had the meanest look on his face while mumbling in his language. This will be the last time coming here. We have no problem with the food being"meh", but when the service makes you feel unwelcomed, it's time to stop coming.<//review>

My table also enjoyed some of the shrimp spring rolls as an appetizer, which were very good. The menus were well worn. Since I don't normally eat this style of food, I am not sure what to compare it to. There was ample parking out front.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

First time eating at this Hoa Viet location.  Food and service was great.  Everything was going great until this “bug” came walking across the floor under our table and disappeared into the side of the wall.
There might be a problem here.</Review>

For not a fancy place , but the food was outstanding. True Vietnamese dishes and believe it or not, the staff is friendly. We are from #idaho, I work with a few Vietnamese guys, they cook occasionally   for the rest of us , and I have to say that this place does a better job then the guys that I work with, even if they're cooking is considered "home cooked".
Try the Vietnamese sandwich with pork.

<review>Found this place when we didnt want to cook for memorial day and they were one of the only viet spots still open. We usually like Pho Lotus in Elk Grove and this was a great substitute. We had spring rolls, rice with bbq chicken and virmicelli noodes with chicken and eggrolls and honestly we thought there wasnt much difference!< /review><name>matt buelow</name><Rate>5<//Rate>< userid>

Thank you! Great experience, great food. Wonderful staff. Staff was quick to notice I was hesitant about the pho I received, they switched it out for the one I ordered. Then I found out I ordered wrong, love pho, but always order it wrong. Again, the staff came to my rescue. Not only did they tell me what I want to order, they got me the pho I wanted. I feel bad that I went through so many bowls of pho, but so grateful for the staff. Having a sore throat, I wanted pho and they delivered. Thank you!</Text>

Wish I can put more stars. Gets better every time I eat there.  Highly,  highly recommend it. If you're down for some real Asian food,  go to this place. The pho is really good and yes the do have different food besides pho.  I recommend that you get small size for the pho.<//Review>

I ordered the charbroiled pork, steamed egg, shredded pork with sunnyside up egg.  Never had tasteless food.  Nonmatter how much fish sauce abd chili pepper I added, nothing helped.  I also ordered a 3 color drink, and it only had one color.  They argued with me that the red was there.  I could've dug my waybto China and it wouldn't have been there.  Then she said it was at the vottom but she added more.  Yeah, right!  I was born on a Tuesday, but not last Tuesday!!  Smdh!< /text>< pictures>

Recently, waitress have change and the two male waitress seem to always forgot order. It pretty bad when you leave because they only serve half your order. I wouldn't recommend it anymore. Used to like this place. Probably will not go anymore.</Review>

I love the Oxnard State Beach Park. The expansiveness to it was impressive and I love that it’s not crowded during the week. Plenty of room to walk, let your dogs off leash, sit and read or enjoy the sun. Very peaceful and quiet.

There is a paved walkway to the beach from the parking lot or. There are two benches when you get the beach to switch shoes or remove sand when leaving.< /text>

Really enjoyed coming to the beach here. The location is awesome looking. The beach is surrounded the ocean on one side and by houses, parks and sand dunes on the other.< /review>

So clean and empty -- haven't seen such an empty beach in a long time. Wonderful & dog friendly. We did see a dead Sea lion on the shore, which was sad.</review>

Very beautiful beach. I had so mucj fun walking up and down the beach finding rocks shells and sand dollars. The beaches where I live shells and sand dollars are scarce. Absolutely beautiful views and it went crowed at all</Text>

Gorgeous park that extends onto a beautiful clean beach between the dunes. I love this park. There's yoga in the afternoon on the grass (sometimes on the beach too!), a playground, and abuts the beach road do it's a great stop on a bike ride. Five stars!<//text>

<review>We found this cool beach park near The Oxnard Marina. This place is great for walking your dog. Located very close to the beach you can walk right threw the park to the beach. There are walking pathways in and around the neighborhood and park. They have a outdoor playground for small kids. Not ever crowded at all. We love this place. Nice clean park with the beach a few steps away!</review><username>Joyce Holland< /username><UserId.>110332373118717824702<//UserId.>< Rating>

We walked the beach and enjoyed the view, but didn't know that oil seeps up from the ocean floor and washes up onto the beach. The bottom of my shoes and feet had glops of black, sticky goo on them. My shoes were ruined. This is not a place I will go back to.</review>

<Review>Was there On Sunday for labor day weekend and it was GORGEOUS! Clean, Bathrooms weren't filthy, It wasn't Packed, Friendly Fun Welcoming Locals, Beach was ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS! And Parking was only $5.00 For the whole  day, Unlike Other Beaches That Are Overpopulated and Dirty where parking is $20 plus<//Review>< pics>

We came in August and the beach was virtually empty! It’s cold and foggy in the mornings so the water is freezing and never warmed up. But we had a blast and got to watch a large pod of dolphins hunting super near the shore for an hour or so. Lots of kelp and tiny sea shells, some sea glass and the occasional crab. There is plenty of sand, some picnic benches, extra bathrooms and the park itself is lovely, although it did get crowded with parents and little ones too young for school just before lunchtime. It’s a large play structure/area and not really a problem. This really is an underrated spot!< /Text>

< Review>
We ordered the Milk Foam Alpine Green tea and Lemon Green team. The tea is so watered down and we couldn’t taste the tea. Boba is chewy, which is why I give 2 stars.< /Review>

<text>By far the best Earl Grey Milk Tea around! This is the only place that includes this gelatin textured additive aside from the boba which far sets it apart from all other milk tea spots. Workers are very nice, I've never been given a bad attitude by any of them. What a treat!<//text><response>None< /response><user>106228272599469901936</user>< Date>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>I've never been to Tea Top and because of the rating I decided to give it a try. This rating is specifically about staff behavior on 4/6/21. The Earl Gray Milk Tea and the Grapefruit Green Tea was good, but not exceptional, so combined with the negative experience with the staff, I'm probably not going back, especially when Teaspoon on Calaveras Blvd and Cha Cha on Milpitas Blvd are closer to the main fairway and I've consistently had a their delicious teas and a positive staff experience at those locations.

Maybe it was an off day for both the staff, but when I walked in...no greeting. When I asked for clarification about their signature drinks, they seemed irritated that I needed clarification. Second, because of the plexiglass between us, hearing the explanations were difficult and when I asked that the info be repeated, the cashier visibly sighed out loud but did not speak any louder. I missed the explanation and decided to stick to ordering the standard drinks listed above.

I was asked to wait outside for my order, and after a longer than usual wait, I went inside to ask about my order, the employee that made the drinks said she had "called out" the order was ready. I told her she needed to speak louder -especially since we were outside -- she just laughed and rolled her eyes. Not sure if they work there everyday, but in this ongoing environment where I have many choices. I will be choosing to spend my time and money elsewhere.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>We usually get the Sun Moon Lake Milk Tea which is my favorite. We also get the fresh milk trifecta, which has no tea but has grass jelly, pearls and red bean, perfect for the kid, a nice treat. During COVID, everyone has masks and there are spots to stand spaced out, also a plastic barrier at the cash register and touchless payment.<//Text>< gmapID>

This Tea Top serves milk tea, which I did not realize until later. I thought they also serve boba tea but I was wrong. I ordered the taro with sago and, it tasted ok. Maybe too chunky for my liking. I should’ve asked for shaved ice. I was expecting the mil tea to be more smooth I guess. I’ll have to try another flavor next time! Yes, I’d come back....<//Text>

This was the second time I was going to this place. I had a very decent experience the first time. This time the tea didn't taste very good and boba's were all so sticky that they didn't come in the straw. I wouldn't go again unless something changes drastically.< /text>

< Review>
A good standard boba shop to go to!! I always get the earl grey which is pretty good! There's free wifi and a couple tables so it's a great place to study especially since it's usually not too busy. I came on a Thursday afternoon and I was the only one in the shop for a while. Wifi can be a bit spotty but worked alright in the end. The tables at the front of the shop all have wall couch seating so it's comfy to study in.</Review>

Overall clean environment, very good selection of teas and they're all made from fresh ingredients. Only thing to pick on is the seating that's RIGHT IN FRONT of the entrance. When someone opens the door on the right, you'll feel being disturbed.<//Text>

Hands down the best quality tea in the area. I've tried many and the only other place that comes close is Tea Society in San Jose. Very high quality tea. The best jasmine earl grey and Darjeeling. They're also the only ones around that have sun moon lake tea. Refreshing fruit drinks too. Highly recommend.</text>

I'm new to bubble tea and I really liked this spot! I prefer to keep my drinks on the less sweet side, so I appreciated being prompted to select the added sugar to my drink. The peach green tea I got was perfect and the fruit at the bottom was just the right amount. There isn't too much seating inside, but they have lots of outdoor space which would be nice to utilize in warmer weather. The space is open and the staff were friendly. It was worth the visit!<//Review>

Every tea I've had so far has been delicious. Good quality drinks. Some people think they are a little on the sweet side but they've been good for me. You can order a lower sugar level if you'd like.

Also regular ice is only 30% of the cup. It's good for most drinks but you might want more for others.</text>

You can get 3Q boba for a decent price. The price has risen over the years but still isn't too bad. Boba milk tea is of a good quality, and their passionfruit tea is also great.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><pictures>None< /pictures><Review>Spacious store and clean. They are in soft opening mode so only open until 7 pm daily.
Everything is ready and all drinks are available even though it's soft opening.
**Update after soft opening. They're fully staffed now and the drinks are prepared fast with good quality. One of the best pearl tea shops in Bay area for sure. The teas are top quality and sugar is properly mixed.
They do have small discount available if you work for companies nearby. Badges are required.</Review></record></dataset><record>

It was overall a great experience. I had no idea those many teas could be made. They have a list and its pretty big. And lots of varieties.  Good place . I have seen a bunch of friends playing cards. I think its permitted.  Visit with your friends to try something new and you will like it if the comapny is great 😉<//review>

Thank God there's more Tea Top's opening in the Bay.

Came here on Christmas, they were open until 6PM on a holiday where normally everything is closed.

Gotta love that Taiwanese/Chinese drive for business.

Got the Sun Moon Lake MT, large, pudding. Literally the only franchise where I can get this style of tea.

Will come back again until they finally build a Tea Top next to my house.<//Review>

Inconsistent pricing. Cashier did not notify me of the price change.
I order number 10 , passion fruit tea with boba and litchi jelly, I asked to substitute the boba to grass jelly. (I did this at another location a week ago, and there is not extra charge). However, when I order this time, they charge me $.50 extra for the change, and did not notify me until I look at the receipt.
Not a lot of money, but just doesn't feel right.
When the two toppings are the same price, and didn't much work to substitute one to another...I don't see why a business can not do that to increase customer satisfaction...</text>

Big tea fan but this place is not recommended. Asked for fresh milk tea with pearls and got fresh milk with pearls. When I had the first sip, I found it pretty weird tasting and then realized it did not have any tea. It was just plain milk. They were not ready to listen when I told them about my order.

Also their payment system was broken that took almost 4-5 min for the transaction to go through. Luckily, this area has a lot of good tea places so we wouldn't have to come here again.< /Review>

<Text>The boba/tea standards in the bay area are high, and Milpitas already had a high concentration of boba tea shops before Tea Top opened up a few years ago. I will have to say though that they've definitely come to become a strong standard in the area with quality teas, great boba, and a good consistency with their product and customer service regardless of when you go in.

The only thing I would change about them would be to wish that their venue space seemed more inviting for hanging out. I really enjoy the atmosphere of Factory Tea Bar in Fremont; makes you want to meet up with friends there. The atmosphere of Tea Top is clean, but just doesn't have the right modern vibe. But that's a pretty small impact factor; not enough for me to dock them off a star.

Quality, price, and consistency are the true winners here. I go to Tea Top and grab drinks to go because I know I'll get what I expect, and they'll craft the drinks quickly. (I-Tea can have ridiculously long waits these days.)<//Text>< Date>

Good milk tea at a good price. The default size is large and they do not skimp on toppings. That are usually included in the price depending on the drink.<//Text>

I'm here almost every weekend. Consistently good service & drinks with generous amount of bobas (which I like). Never a long wait, they make the drinks fast & efficiently. Only one time when they ran out of bobas early in the afternoon due to a large order just ahead of mine.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Huber park is by far the best park in the bay area. I grew up a 2 minute walk from this wonderful park and I think it really changed my childhood for the better. The facilities are clean, the play equipment is creative and inspiring to young minds, and there is a beautiful hillside area for all ages right above the park area. It is hard to find a park of this caliber any more these days, but Huber park is one good park.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085791254b6c6c9:0x749d7e8e8a003114<//Gmap_id></record>

Cool place, secluded little park I use to go to with my friends back when I was in high school. Not too many people know about this place unless you are a local. Easy to miss it driving by.<//review>

The access is awful. Older kids will have fun, but not too old. The 'old' factor of the park is cool but it is poorly updated. Restroom building is enormous but always locked unless you have key rental. Best feature is the basketball court for older kids and adults. Turkeys roam.< /Text>

Very pleasant, small park. A little annoying that it goes up a hill, but that’s also part of the charm. A tree fell on a fence recently and the damage is pretty ugly, but they’re working on it.</text>

<review>Today I was helped by Joseph! The service and response I received was amazing. I started my process over the phone the day prior, so when I came in the today to check out the car, it was a seamless process. The honestly are not trying to keep you all day. If you come prepared you will get the car you want in a reasonable amount of time. Thank you to all the staff that was helpful, consistent, and understanding 🙏🏾💜💪🏾</review>< Rate>

Got the best deal for a first time buyer. Great service low prices and even helped me get approved thru a credit union. If you need a car go see them.</Review>

I just purchased my first vehicle from Jaime Lopez and Cars on Demand and I'm very happy with my experience.  Jaime is very knowledgeable and professional.  He explained everything thoroughly.  I highly recommend Jaime to all my friends and Family.  I just bought a KIA FORTE COUPE. Thanks Jaime and everyone at Cars on Demand.</Review>

**** read the update****
Jaime and Hector took amazing care of me. Working with me to find and get approved  for an amazing  vehicle.  I would definitely  recommend this place. Joseph and everyone here are helpful and friendly.

Update: left the original post.
Changing from a 5 to a 2 after further investigation.

Here are some factors you must consider and make your own choices.

Cars are duty inside.  No cleaning prior to or in-between people seeing it.

Car dealership fail to protect customers information, so be warned if you are trading in a car. The car i bought  still had the old owner dmv information inside the glove box.

Talking about their  names, address, and etc.

So zero customers data protection.

In a current covid era, it won't be wise to take your chances here.

Also don't expect to get the website price?, they use disclosures and disclaimers to make you pay more.

Also they will try and make it seem like you getting a deal with the online prices because someone made an error, and of you don't buy then, there is no chance you will get that price again.

They will take care of you so they can get a sell, and when they followed up  a week later and I brought up the difference in price, they blocked and never replied back.

You won't get a car on a full tank either, you buy what's in the tank at the time of purchase.

Also they told me a kia was inside, but when I arrived  it was never there.

2 stars because the car seems to still be running well.< /review>

<username>Faithful Skate Shop< /username><Text>5 STARS ALL ACROSS THE BOARD. Customer Service was great by the whole staff. Especially my sales professional who worked with, Jaime Lopez, made the whole experience super easy. He knows his stuff and he wasn’t just trying to get me into just any truck. He asked me what I was gonna use it for, asked me what my Budget was, and I was able to get a great deal on an Awesome Ford F-150 that was a fleet truck so it didn’t have High Miles! They don’t have all their inventory online so head down there and walk the lot. Plenty of parking for you so no worries about parking down the street and having to walk to the dealership. You won’t be disappointed with your experience. Ask for JAIME Lopez!!!!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5</rating><GmapID>0x808e33c83abcbd2f:0x96f57627c76792a3<//GmapID>< Resp>

Lied to us from the moment we got there. Salesman said he drove the truck and it worked perfectly.  Pushed to finance before we drove it.  We refused.  The truck wouldn't start, no gas.  Came back a half hour later, the mechanic was under the hood holding broken sparkplugs from the truck in his hand.  We do not recommend this place.</text>

Thank you to Jaime for he’s great help on getting me the best deal on my purchase, I also emailed him with couple questions and he promptly responded, I needed to sign papers and i mentioned how i was short on time & he had everything ready so when I got there things were quicker for me.

<review>Sold me a car with transmission problems and they won’t take it back. They knew about the problem right away because their mechanic scanned the cars computer in front of me and they still told me to keep driving the car after only oil change. Very unprofessional they are liars and don’t give you every document you sign like they are supposed to. I will never do business with them again. I definitely will not recommend them.<//review></record>

<text>(Translated by Google) I do not recommend cars on demand for the reason that they do not sell good cars, the transmission goes bad after three months I bought a good one and they do not want to be responsible ... much less they make deals with the bender Jaime. Because he told me and he told me not to know me, be very careful with that bender JAIMEEEE

Art Deco interiors are met with new age dining options - you can be a picky eater here. Lots of vegan and gluten free options/substitutes. I’ve been coming here since 2007 and they always hit the spot.

The vibes in this cafe are on point. Colorful posters decorate the walls and there are neat circular windows along the walls.

Grab a menu (you’ll see them) and seat yourself upon arrival. I always get something different, and I am always happy with it. From their Vegan nachos with cheese, guac and black beans to their breakfast with eggs, bacon and potatoes - all of it is good.

If you like sweets, look at the bar area to see slices of the cakes they have that day, kept in glass cake stands.

Perfect for solo dining or for parties of around 6.<//text>

Service was very friendly and fast. Food was good (although my potatoes were covered in rosemary), coffee was good. The atmosphere and the music did fit the interior design. You have a great possibility to watch people walking by, either from the inside or the outside seating area.< /review>

<text>Our server was awesome! We had to wait because the kitchen was behind. The coffee was good. I had huevos rancheros which were good! It was covered with a rally good sauce. It’s was not drowned with juice. I would come here again. Love the old school ambience of a real diner.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZUDlkzRDNyzKVHgw3Av585ZBm3K2SL8DI44Py=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Very nice place. You got great people working there. The food tastes very good and the price is pretty cheap. Also in a great location for breakfast before having a long walk on the beach and pier.< /Review>< name>

<Review>Awesome breakfast! I tried the "All American" and it was delicious. Ask for the pure Marple Syrup with your pancakes, definitely worth it. Also the waitress was very welcoming.< /Review>< user_id>

Great place for breakfast!
Hands down the best pancakes I had in the US. Fluffy, tasty, not pancake-mix-like contrary to other diners I visited.
The guacamole is also fresh and well-seasoned.

Bonus points for service and decoration!<//Text>

What a great place!!! Very late hrs, amazing food. Party times! I came here with several friends, after an event, so there were 4 of us. Very youthful modern, friendly vibe, big enough to be comfortable. Also has a bar, for those fast hitting partiers 😁👌.
We talked to several staff members, omg, they were sooo funny 🤣💯🙏. So definitely a place to have a nice friendly chat, a great time with friends, and great quality food... until 3am like we did 😇😁🙏💯❤️</Text>

The food is okay if you consider how cheap their prices are. I'm not a bargain hunter looking for big and inexpensive plate of food. If that's your thing, you'll like this place.< /review>

Had the late night munchies after leaving a bar and didn't realize Swingers was a healthy diner! Caught me by surprise, but that's way better than eating grease from other restaurants. I got the breakfast burrito, which didn't fully satisfy my drunk cravings, but it tasted decent and I didn't feel horrible afterwards. My friend said the steak and eggs were just OK.</Review>

Stumbled upon this place just walking around and was not disappointed. I had a great breakfast, the food was spot on and the bloody mary was decent. The seating outside was comfortable and shady. I'd absolutely go back again. 5/5!<//Review>

Try the vegan pancakes! They're so good. Plus this place is open quite late so it's nice for comfort food when you need it.< /Review>

Retro, trendy diner with solid Californian fare. Think sandwiches, eggs, salads, and Mexican options. There are a good number of vegan options for breakfast and dinner, the soyrizo scramble is very good. Great service and reasonably priced as well.<//review>

I was digging the retro diner atmosphere, the staff make this place very warm and inviting, feels like they'd know the locals by name and order. I found the food to be ok, the swingers burger tasted a little dry, the chicken sandwich was decent, the fries were horrible, tasted like they were reheated.<//Review>

<Review>Santa Monica's super hip version of a Denny's diner.  If you don't like the music that's playing, the next song will be a completely different era and genre.

Great people watching as you eat tasty, traditional diner breakfast and other foods.  Service is super fast and friendly.  I find myself wandering in here a lot when I'm in town.< /Review>< pics>

I've always loved this place. I've been going here since 1991. The food is consistently good. They have gf pancakes now. They aren't the best but I appreciate that they are good and I could order them late night.</Review>

<review>The food was good as was the service, I had a spicy bloody Mary and chicken piccotta a nice portion. My only complaint would be the music , it was harsh very grunge to me not fitting to the atmosphere which they captured very well. Sinatra, and other singers from that era would have made it a more memorable place. Hence only 3 stars instead of 4.</review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>4< /rating><review>Excellent service! Great American food! Healthy and delicious! The waitress was lovely and very attentive. Our choice for seats. Not much room for 2 growing teenage boys and 2 adults of average built. Tables can be a bit larger. The place is clean and orderly. My boys were very satisfied eating something other than fast food. 4 thumbs up!<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2a4cda153ea65:0xe05d36a5739f1702</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place is always pretty cool. Parking is a bit of a pinch on the weekends or at night. The menu is wide ranging and the food is good if your expectations aren't too high. The service is friendly enough. If you're lucky you'll see a celebrity or two.<//review>

Fantastic place. Great atmosphere and great food. Modern organic, vegan friendly take on a classic American diner.

We went in for breakfast and ended up have the chicken sandwich - it was sublime. My partner had it with the salad and a ranch dressing and I had it with fries. Even the fries were great. Cut straight from the potato and super fluffy.  A really good potion size. I seriously didn't think I would finish all the fries after the sandwich but I couldn't leave such yummy fries. Fresh chicken with bacon and avocado in a delicious brioche bun.

Service was quick and efficient and who ever the guy was at the front... despite his no nonsense attitude, I really enjoyed his attentiveness and accent.
Top place to go.</review>

Always yummy!! The blat on gluten-free bread is delish!! Their gluten-free pancakes are great too! Fun decor, groovy music on the jukebox, super sweet and friendly staff, and scrumptious comfort food. Not sure why it's not more crowded. 😍🌈😻👍< /text>

Been to the Hollywood and the Santa Monica locations. Both are cool for some comfort food and have that diner vibe to them. The Santa Monica location is a bit run down with torn upholstery on the booth seats which needs to be fixed.< /Text>

<Text>Funky name, good food. American, Californian, Vegan, lots of organics and salads and sandwiches, soups, good stuff. Atmosphere's  nice, servers are speedy, what else would you want. Nothing's cheap in
Santa Monica, but the food is worth it.
And yeah, they could have called it something worse. Hipsters?<//Text>< Name>

<Text>Food is always good. And consistent. If the banana pancakes were good last week, well lucky you - they taste just as good today.
The service is always bustling and friendly. If they suddenly get slammed and they're under-staffed, they work twice as hard.
THE VEGAN BURRITO is amazeballs, and I recommend you try it even if you're not vegan... it's that good.
The "vegan multi-grain gluten free banana pancakes" (no really) are absolutely delicious. Real maple syrup too.<//Text><user>113924127356889315682</user><name>Christopher Jeske<//name><date>1546568671031<//date>< gmapID>

The first time I was with a group of friends and my order was the only one that didn’t make it to the table. The second time the service was descent. The third time, I waited 45 minutes for my food not to make it to my table. It’s safe to say that I won’t be back to this establishment. Poor service.< /Review>< pics>

Great atmosphere and service was fine but, pancakes overcooked, coffee tasted burnt and I really don't like it when pancakes are served on the same plate as the rest of your breakfast. Sausage was small patty and not enough syrup served plus, toast was extra which seems like the trend everywhere...another not so great experience.<//Review>< resp>

Great alternative to norms or dennys. Little higher priced, but food is a little better. I love their waffles.  Had a party of 8 with some people that had special needs, the staff accommodated us
Breakfast served all day
Hamburger is tasty.</text>

I always have a wonderful time at Swingers. Service: Reliably great. Food: Dependably delicious. The large, varied menu has enough choices for any taste or diet restrictions. Smart management keeps popular items on the menu, so you can get your favorite any/every time. Los Angeles needs more late-night options like this one.</Text>

I love diners and this diner was awesome. I got the avocado toast and coffee, which was delicious. My friend got gluten free pancakes (always exciting when a place has gluten free options). The service was friendly and fast. The decor was very interesting and it was clean. If you enjoy traditional diner food and atmosphere, definitely check this place out.< /Text>

<Text>I love swingers. It has an eclectic yet old school feel. The breakfast is delicious, and they offer cafe free eggs, organic veggies, bottled cold pressed juices, and vegan options. The portions are good for the price, especially considering the area. It gets busy late at night and on the weekends, but it's usually  mellow during the week for breakfast.  The coffee is also great, and service is almost always on point.< /Text>< pics>

I love the smokey maple bacon.  It was a late night dinner and Swingers was the only nearby restaurant.  Compare to other diners, Swingers at night has a nicely lit space, sans the flourescents lighting.  It even has a wider range of music and get to listen to it for free without the jukebox selection. The music is at a great level, you can have a conversation as well as hear yourself think. The place is quite clean and the service is very good.  The servers are very friendly and warm to their customers.  The service is fast as well. The Andy Warhol art work on the walls are fantastic, it really fits the SAMO vibe.<//Text>

This is a great classic American Diner in downtown Santa Monica. The menu offers many traditional and contemporary cuisine choices. The staff is friendly and professional. There is limited free parking adjacent to the restaurant. The menu prices are about what you would expect for the area.</text>

Utterly fantastic and ever-dependable. Caters to all tastes, from health nuts to stoner junk food junkies. Relaxed and polite staff, and affordable prices for what is extremely elevated "diner" food. I'll never forget Drew Carey's support during the Strike. What a guy. What a restaurant.< /Text>

This is my third trip here and I must say, everything is perfect! The place has a groovy vibe about it with a touch of nostalgic that makes me feel like I'm back in a time I never knew. The staff works like a smooth running motor and doesn't seem to miss anything. Visit this place, it's worth it!!!<//Review>

<user_name>Greg Jackson</user_name><review>Was invited to meet up with a local friend who recommended Swingers as a local favorite.  It was refreshing to have the authentic California BLT with avocado and steam broccoli (so much broccoli, I loved it!).   Refreshing to get away from all the tourists at Santa Monica Pier and the waterfront areas.

Pricing was moderate (like $14 for a sandwich), but they are generous helpings.<//review><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<review>Slinger's was a throwback to the old 50 diner style Cafe. The menu had a very interesting selection of healthy foods to select from. I had two chocolate wheat pancakes and they were excellent along with a side of cranberry juice the portion was three large pancakes more than enough the show me up when I couldn't eat it all. The rest of the guests had variety of egg dishes that were also delectable and appealing to the eye. the waiter was very friendly pleasant and courteous and the wait staff was very attentive to our needs I would definitely recommend you visit when you are in Santa Monica.<//review>< pics>

I love that place, they always have good mudic, the guys are cool and nice, and the food goes with it. Whether it's for breakfast, lunch, coffee or dinner you'll always have a good time and great vibe. Being gluten free I have omelettes and salads, their quinoa bowl is really good and fulfilling. They also have gluten free waffle and that's my son's favorite. They use real silverware and napkins, makes you feel so much better.did I tell you that I love this place?</text>

< Review>
This diner, perfectly situation on the corner of Lincoln and Broadway, has a really huge menu with a lot of vegan and and vegetarian options. (Thank you!)

It has an old Hollywood rock n' roll vibe which I really like. Their chicken piccata was not what I expected it was really good. The chicken was marinated with lemon, capers, shallots, and olive oil. Actually gave me a good idea to try cook.

I'm sad I did not have a chance to try their peanut butter and banana shake, but I heard it's a must try. Service was good, price was moderated. Overall, it was a good experience.<//Review>

<Text>Old family staple, I suggest the cob salad with the vegetarian bacon. Parking can be a challenge, they have no dedicated lot so you are stuck with street parking. Fun at after hours to take a small group ( 5 - 8 ), there is also an outdoor area.< /Text>< Pictures>

Our visit to Santa Monica included Swingers.  We weren't sure about the menu as we have finicky eaters in our group.  Everyone was more than satisfied.  Signs do state you should pick up your own menu and choose your own seat, however we were guided to seats asking if we liked that selection.  We were also given menus.  Our waitress was very pleasant and helpful as was the host.  Definitely something for everyone on the menu.  We returned later in the evening to use the bathroom and were welcomed back.  Wanted to visit again, but time would not permit.< /review>

Consistently decent food that surprises you in a good way more often than most diners. Also, the wait staff always tries their best to be attentive, but some nights are more difficult than others due to the crowd size. Even so, the kitchen keeps pace all day long.</review>

< Review>
I was told this place was great. I just ate here tonight. It took ten minutes for anyone to even acknowledge me and I was sitting at the counter. A long haired guy walked by me at least 6 times without asking me anything. When I did finally get to order, it was a very short conversation and I didn't really feel like she cared to talk to me at all. I don't suggest ordering the steak. The broccoli is bland, the fries are crap and the steak was smaller than my cell phone. All for 16 bucks. It's a rip off. Overall, service is shotty and the food isn't worth what you pay for.< /Review>

<text>Consistently decent food that surprises you in a good way more often than most diners. Also, the wait staff always tries their best to be attentive, but some nights are more difficult than others due to the crowd size. Even so, the kitchen keeps pace all day long.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I was told this place was great. I just ate here tonight. It took ten minutes for anyone to even acknowledge me and I was sitting at the counter. A long haired guy walked by me at least 6 times without asking me anything. When I did finally get to order, it was a very short conversation and I didn't really feel like she cared to talk to me at all. I don't suggest ordering the steak. The broccoli is bland, the fries are crap and the steak was smaller than my cell phone. All for 16 bucks. It's a rip off. Overall, service is shotty and the food isn't worth what you pay for.</review>

Oh my goodness, the food was sooooo good here. So many delicious options for carnivores, vegetarians, vegans, etc. My ONLY negative comment is that the tables/booths are not good for people with long legs or wide bodies. It’s like they were designed for children. Totally worth it though.</review>

<Review>Well, it's a trendy hipster-friendly place. Not much else to say about it. It's great for a place to gather up the gang at after a late night bar-hop. I also like that it's not brightly lit. (I have an obsession for dimly lit eateries). The food was a bit mediocre though. With the exception of the onion rings. Those were thee absolute best I've ever had. ever. ....EVER.< /Review>< Name>

<Text>We came at lunch time and the queue was pretty long. The food, however, was worth the wait: a bagel with salmon was amazing, accompanied by soothing music. I would give 5 stars if not for the service: the waiter was almost rude, but despite quite heavy load we got our meals pretty fast.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2a4cda153ea65:0xe05d36a5739f1702</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Swingers is great. I love the laid back vibe.

You can't go wrong with any breakfast item here but my favorites are the Banana Pancakes and the Tofu chilaquiles.<//Review>

This place is really cool. We went there a couple times during our stay in Santa Monica. For breakfast, lunch or dinner, service is friendly and efficient. For breakfast, try the huevos rancheros! For dinner, the chili is good, mac n' cheese really good and and burgers, excellent. Try a cupcake for dessert, the red velvet maybe?< /review>

I had a horrible experience that really burst my bubble today at the Swinger's Santa Monica location - After being a regular here for years who comes here at least once a week, I will never be coming back again after my experience with Juliana.  She was rude and gave me attitude, failing to even get me a menu and finally basically asking me to leave because I had plugged my laptop in, rather than of course just being nice and friendly about it.  Regardless of slowness or not being able to plug in a laptop, I am very usually forgiving about inconveniences at places like this because I love being there, but the real problem was customer service and because of Juliana I will not be returning.<//review>

The service aas slow, but I usually overlook that if the food is good. It wasn't. On top of all of that, it was expensive. As if to add insult to injury.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>Funky (fun is key) diner with modern large menu,  breakfast,  lunch,  dinner,  late night (open till 3am on weekends).  The usual with some surprises and good selection of vegetarian options (including home made veggie burgers,  and veggie bacon and sausage and vegan cheese- not just items with "no meat"); Everything from steak and eggs and Belgian waffles to avocado toast, blue corn nachos, burgers, sandwiches, pasta, quinoa, salads, etc. Smoothies,  specialty coffee drinks, milkshakes plus Beer, wine and mimosas. Pay the juke box by the front door to listen to your favorite old punk and alternative rock records while you dine. There's a patio if you like to eat al fresco or with your pooch. There's a tiny free parking lot in back or meters on the streets all around that are free in the evening. "Ass, cash,  or grass. Nobody eats for free."<//Review>< Pics>

A little disappointed, no one was eating their boca burger naked. Pretty standard fare with the only twist being their name. No swinging at swingers ;-p. My pursuit of eating a grilled cheese naked in public continues….. over priced. I imagine a vegan or vegetarian really appreciates a 24 hour diner that has food they can eat</Text>

For when you just want good diner food. Also, just try and empty your cup of joe. They somehow fill it back up even when you're drinking right from it.< /review>

Great prices for Santa Monica (though still a bit pricey for brunch) with a standard diner menu. Much better than Denny's, above average food overall.</Review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>A fixture of my own personal post-outing nightlife since way back when, Swingers is a staple of Santa Monica since long before the metro rail and Starbucks boom of the WestSide gentrification era. A amalgamation of omni, vegetarian, and vegan options keep the vast menu accessible to most if not all dining preferences, while the coffees, shakes, and sinful desserts offer a plethora of treats for those looking for less than a meal. Long hours, free wifi, and beautiful, quirky, and attentive servers maintain the venue's neighborhood cafe vibe, while sustaining that old-school Santa Monica community feel. A definite must see for anyone seeking a reminder of what L.A. used to be!</Review>< Pictures>

<review>when i used to work on the westside, THIS WAS MY LATE NIGHT SPOT!!! i used to love coming in after work and having the tuna melt! the santa monica location is way chiller than the beverly spot, brighter and easier to get a seat at. BUT the beverly location is where you might accidentally sit next to Dave Navarro or rub shoulders with other Hollywood celebrities...< /review><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4cda153ea65:0xe05d36a5739f1702</Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

Swingers is a place with great food and plenty of healthy options.  I have been going to Swingers for over 6 years now and they have been going down in service.<//Text>

<Review>I like the atmosphere better than the food (not that the food is bad) and the staff (not always very welcoming or flexible to say the least). Open late, which is always a plus.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Even for hungry late-night patrons with low standards, this place falls short. The food was near inedible. The worst of our orders was a botched peanut butter and jelly. How do you fail at making a PB&J? It would be one star, but our server was patient and somewhat friendly.</text>

Way over priced. Just for a cheeseburger & fries.</Text>

(Translated by Google) It is recommended diner near from Santa Monica pier.
The interior of the store was a 60's style interior, and the volume of music was not large and it was a space where you can relax.
Santa Monica is happy because there are many restaurants with vegetarian menu.
There are also restaurants here and vegan pancakes, and many delightful menus for vegetarian
It was a very delicious dish with a beautiful look and a seasoning of the ingredients without wasted seasoning.
I highly recommend it!
The staff was good too!
Even if it goes by car, there is a parking lot dedicated to 3 or 4 shops behind the shop, so it is safe because it can be parked if it is vacant.

(Original)
Santa Monica pierからも近くおすすめダイナーです。
店内は60年代風の内装で音楽の音量も大きくなくゆったりできる空間でした。
Santa Monicaはvegetarian menuがあるレストランも多いので嬉しいです。
ここのレストランもveganパンケーキもあったりとvegetarianには嬉しいメニューが多く
見た目も綺麗な盛り付けで無駄な味付けもなく素材をいかした味付けでとっても美味しかったです。
とってもおススメです！
スタッフの方もいい人でした！
車で行ってもお店の裏に3、4台お店専用の駐車場があるので空いてる時間であれば停めれるので安心です。<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Top service, fair price, tasty food.

It's just difficult to find a parking space, but you can do it across the street at the Vons if you dare.

Top service, fair price, tasty food.

Es ist nur schwierig einen Parkplatz zu finden, aber gegenüber beim Vons geht's, wenn man sich traut.<//text>< Pictures>

Das Restaurant ist das einzige was noch bis spät abends auf hat und Alkohol ausschenkt. Das Essen ist mittelmäßig und die Bedienungen arbeiten auch eher im Trott.</Text>< Time>
