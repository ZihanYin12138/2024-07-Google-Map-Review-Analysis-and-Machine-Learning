My husband and I booked diving with this venture a year ago for our honeymoon in San Diego. WHAT A MISTAKE. We showed up, on time, and were met with nobody. We contacted the "shop" (there isn't one) and called the number multiple times - we even went into the hotel that SD Expositions is supposedly based out of. The hotel staff looked mostly confused, and said they haven't seen the operator, Nick, in an extended time. We finally heard back from Nick and the only thing he had was a list of wild excuses, all of which we were willing to overlook because of the promise to go diving. We attempted to meet up, he arrived over an hour late and spun a story of stolen equipment (regulators) by a disgruntled employee and asked if we could reschedule for later that day. We said yes and we agreed to adjusting the monetary rates for the afternoon dive and the night dive. We arrived for the afternoon dive and Nick never showed up. We tried to contact for over an hour, all the while being completely ignored. We gave up and reached out again for the evening dive, and again we were ignored. We finally received a text message that he would issue us a full refund (just take a look at the screenshots). Low and behold, we never got a refund. We paid through PayPal, started a claim to which he had 10 days to reply. There was no response within 10 days, we received our money back. Problem solved, right?? WRONG. Somehow, this lowlife responded after the deadline and PayPal overturned the decision. All without letting us know. We have text messages from Nick all stating that he would refund us our almost $1,000, and now we are in a completely different boat having lost that $1,000. Don't EVER do business with this unethical and morally corrupt person who fathoms to state he runs a legitimate business.<//Text>

WARNING OUT OF BUSINESS - Had a great experience diving with them 6 years ago, so I booked with them again. Received a confirmation email and everything, but the morning of the dive no one showed. Tried calling and emailing, but no response. Ran into another person who experienced the same thing. Thankfully Zach’s Scuba Shack was able to accommodate a last minute booking and had great experience!<//Text>

I had a fantastic experience with SD Expeditions! This was my first time diving since I got my Open Water Diver certification and our Dive Master, Kristin was super! We were lucky enough to see a sea lion that swam with us for nearly a half an hour. Great customer service, good quality gear, easy location, and very fun dive for a beginner like me but there was so much to see that I think anyone would have fun!<//review>

<review>Our 2-day dive trip (4 tank dives) were cancelled due to bad ocean condition, which is understandable, but the communication around it was quite bad.

First day I got a text message right before the meeting time. Would've been better if it was done earlier, but fine, sometimes it takes a while to check on the condition.

Second day I get no message, so went to the meeting spot. No one is around. I sent text message after the scheduled time and found the staff, waiting for another staff to check on the ocean condition. The shore dive was still impossible that day, so he said he would see to a boat dive and would contact me before noon. We went back to the hotel and waited, but no message past noon. I texted and got a reply that boat dive is also a no go. No response for my follow up question, or offering discount for future dives or anything.

I understand the nature is unpredictable, but I expected a little more professionalism for the price we paid (for no dive). We wasted much time waiting, just to get "no" without much explanation or any follow up.

They may be great when out in the ocean, but I don't think I'll risk another trip with this operator to find out.< /review><user>116017447014842057205</user>< Time>

I have a major shark obsession and am super stoked to have local company to help with that obsession! SD expeditions was a pleasure to work with and most importantly I felt safe during these wild animal encounters. Customer service was amazing, boat was beautiful and my experience was unforgettable.

I paid over $900 for a friend an I to go on a shark dive excursion. Today was the day, and the tour operator never showed up. We waited with the rest of the tour participants for two hours...calling the shop, emailing, and asking locals if this is normal. Sadly, they said he "usually runs 45 minutes late" and when we reported back that it was two hours late he said he wasn't surprised at all. So...we drove into La Jolla to their dive shop to ask for a refund. Despite the web site saying they were open until 7pm, it was closed. We walked to a local shop to ask if they knew what was going on with SD Expeditions...they informed us that several people had come into their shop asking the same thing, complaining about having lost money, and never receiving a call regarding cancelling of the tour...no show. Just ridiculous. Over 8 hours later, they still haven't responded to emails and phone messages. Stay far away from this joke.</Text>

Did a two tank dive in La Jolla cove. It was a fun experience and the dive master Brian was really helpful and knowledgeable. Equipment was all in good condition. I was worried about being cold but the wet suits kept me toasty warm. I recommend SD Expeditions and would dive with them again.<//text>

It so happened that the in-water shark opportunities didn't materialize on our trip, but aside from that it was a great day.  Kyle & Nick made every effort to make the trip a success, and I believe that was appreciated by all participants.  While sharks were scarce, we did have great topside encounters and photo-ops with a harbor seal, sea lions, common and Pacific white-sided dolphins and even a humpback whale.

SD Expeditions is the best!!! I headed out with three friends yesterday on an SD Expeditions trip to swim with sharks in the open ocean.  What an amazing day!  We boarded a gorgeous , beautifully maintained yacht - Countershade.  On the way out to our offshore destination, Captain Mark did not hesitate to let us investigate anything interesting - we saw at least two gray whales and got to jump in on a kelp paddy.  Once we got to our spot offshore, the chumming began. Nick and Mark did a great job attracting gorgeous blue sharks within two hours.  Both Nick and Mark went over detailed safety briefings about what to expect.  Then in we went!  If you haven't swam with a blue shark in open water, you are missing out!  These are some of the most gorgeous animals, colored indigo blue contrasted with gleaming white bellies, and dusted in gold glitter on the edges.  The sharks were a little shy at first, but gradually became more comfortable around us.  We had about two hours in the water with these beauties.  When the action started to get a little hectic, Nick had us get back on the boat - I really appreciate his dedication to keeping us as safe as possible.  From the boat, we were treated to six sharks circling the boat!!  A totally amazing day with a great operation!  We will be back soon!</text>

<Review>How could this place get a 4 star! This is a 5 star operation all the way around.  This is an operation that you want to dive with - even if you're a beginner. Forget the others who send out diving want-to-be professionals. Nick is at the top and so is the operation. You should only dive through this shop if you are going to dive in CA. And - their photography is out of this world.﻿< /Review>< user>

Overview:  Yes, I would recommend their shore dive to a fit athletic friend to use SD Expeditions.  I have been diving for 40 years and have dove all over the world and found SD Expeditions to be fast, truthful, safety conscious, and fun to dive with.

Pros: Small group!  Professionally led dive consisting of 5 divers inclusive of the dive master.  Top notch great gear, knowledgeable dive leader, and patient.  Great telephone contact, follow up, and superior equipment.

Cons:  Be prepared to hike 150 yards with your gear on to get to the beach entry.  In a full wetsuit with weights, tank, fins this is not for the faint of heart.    Also, be prepared for a 1/4 mile surface swim out to the dive site and back from the dive site.  It is certainly not recreational warm water drift diving or boat diving where you have staff move, manage, pick you up after you surface, and ready the gear for reentry.

If you are ok, with the hike, swim, and dive.  Then you will  have a super time.  If you are used to warm water staffed boat dives you might find this a bit more challenging.</Review>

The fact that the company has not taken down their website and is still accepting payments is borderline fraud.

<review>Oct 23, 2019: I’m at the spot we’re supposed to meet by 8:00. I just got a text at 7:45 saying my guide can’t dive today. Other divemasters here are telling me this is an improvement - for the last couple weeks it’s been mostly no-call no-shows by SD Expeditions. Apparently the owner is very ill. I have sympathy for him, but the online booking system should be shut down and those who have booked dives should be notified immediately, not in the moment they’re stranded at the meetup spot.< /review>< pictures>

Nick, Alice and the SD Expeditions crew were wonderful.  They keep us in the loop and had everything ready to go.  They were very accommodating and top notch.  We will definitely dive with them again.

Our Dive Master was a wonderful woman named Karma who was incredible.  She made us feel very comfortable and explained the dive, helped us with every aspect and really made us feel very comfortable.  She is a great person who made the dive a great experience.

Thank you again SD Expeditions!<//text>

I just got my family scuba certified (youngest is 14) and this was most of my families first dive trip. SD Expeditions was so great to work with! They helped setup our trip. Nick, our dive master, kept saying he wanted this to be a great experience for everyone and he didn’t just say it he made it happen.  Even though some of my family was a bit nervous he alleviated their concerns and made this a great experience!  I would recommend SD Expeditions to anyone (pro or novas) and I will definitely use them again when I dive in the Sand Diego area.</text>

Nick was a great guide. It was my first time diving in a while, but he took his time getting me adjusted. First dive was good just off of La Jolla Beach. Second dive was in the Kelp Forest, but it got cancelled because of weather. Nick was up front about the conditions and let me make the call. I'd recommend purchasing the insurance, which I did for around $22, so there was no issues getting a refund on the second dive. Great experience.< /text>

<Review>We had a great time!  Nick and Kyle were awesome!  They were so knowledgeable and their love of the ocean was very apparent.  We saw whales, tons of dolphins, sea lions, an elephant seal and 4 hammerhead sharks.  It was a lot of fun and we hope to be able to do it again some time soon.< /Review>< pictures>

Last week of March I flew into San Diego for three days and wanted to go diving. I called a few places but unfortunately most places only do shore dives, or only do Fri-Sun, I wanted a boat dive and only had Monday available.

I asked them for a recommendation and one name kept coming up from every one, SD Expeditions. They were on my list to call and I was impressed with their website; their dives looked and sounded much better than the other places.

I called and told them my plans. The lady there took the time to explain about each of their dives, all sounded great, and asked me what I was most interested in seeing.

They only had one other person signed up for Monday, then she told me do not worry she will make the dive happen for me and wanted me to have a chance to enjoy the waters here. This was awesome, she was amazing.

She took down all my sizes, they provide all the equipment, and I did the paperwork on line.

I flew in Sunday morning all excited, but unfortunately later that day the Maritime weather service sent out a small craft warning that a storm was headed in Sunday night and will last until Tuesday.

They contacted me and sent me a copy of the warning. I was sad but impressed by how they handled the news and how they treated me.

I cannot wait to come back to San Diego to dive with them. They have the best sounding dives (see the pictures and info online) and the staff is awesome, I was truly impressed. I recommend this place to anyone going to San Diego.< /review>< pics>

I hate writing bad reviews but I had a decent experience on my trip, most of the staff was nice, one in particular kept asking "what made me decide to do this?" Since I feel like I looked like I didn't do things like this often. Definitely felt singled out of the group, they forgot my camera I had rented and never sent pictures to me afterwards as promised. Like I said it was a decent experience but I wouldn't think of going back.<//review>

I went on a dive tour with Kyle and Nick, and it was the best underwater experience I have ever had in San Diego. What really stood out to me was the quality of the equipment we used. These guys know whats up and their passion for what they do shows. It is so cool to see people making a living doing something they are so passionate about.</review>

<Text>Fin-tastic time aboard SD Expeditions for shark and wildlife viewing!!  I’ve gone out with shark-diving operations in various places/shark species.  I was extremely impressed with Nick and Mark’s focus on safety, as well as their respect for wildlife. It was clear they love what they do, and, like the rest of us, love sharks!

My dive buddies and I were able to spend time in the water observing and photographing several beautiful blue sharks.  I’ll never forget the amazing encounters.  And icing on the cake, the boat was incredibly comfortable, and the crew provided delicious snacks and sandwiches.  We’re already planning our next trip with SD Expeditions.  Thank you, Mark and Nick for championing shark conservation and for an incredible trip!<//Text>< Response>

<Text>Our dive was unfortunately cancelled due to red tide, but SD expeditions was extremely professional through the whole process and a PLEASURE to work with! The dive master personally called us the morning of our shore dive, before we ordered an Uber to La Jolla, allowing us to make other travel arrangements.

SD Expeditions also tried to get us on another boat dive the same day, and upon finding out we lived across the country and would not be able to reschedule the dive, Connor was so accommodating in making sure we didn't lose our money.

You can't control the weather, but 5 stars for customer service! Highly recommend.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dc01526bbd3249:0x8f38b63108060962< /GmapID></record>

<Review>We had an amazing 2 tank boat dive with Nick and Kyle near Point Loma.  We went with 2 other divers and we loved the small group experience SD expeditions provides. Not only are they really easy to talk to, but they are extremely knowledgeable about scuba diving and the local marine life.   My husband and I hadn't been diving in over 9 months, and I was a little rusty with my dive skills.  Kyle was so patient with me and really made me feel comfortable in the water.  By the second dive, I felt much more at relaxed.  Thank you Nick and Kyle!!  We can't wait to dive with SD expeditions again!</Review>< pictures>

Fantastic time!  Nick (the dive master) was actually hesitant to go at first because he thought the recent storm would make visibility difficult and he wanted to make sure I had a great time.  When we got out there, he made sure I was comfortable and showed me a plethora of aquatic life (octopus, halibut, crab, and even a stingray).  Great dive for people of all levels, I'll definitely go back!< /review>

Nick and Mark were awesome!  They gave us the experience of a lifetime... free swimming with a hammerhead.  They took care of us from start to finish providing food, drinks, warm jacket, and clear direction on how to safely experience a shark.  Nick worked tirelessly most of the day to find a shark.  Incredible and highly recommend!!!</Text>

It ended up being pretty awesome. We had a few hiccups, but in the end they made it right. They had cancelled on me once because the ocean conditions honestly weren't good so they gave me a voucher to come back. The voucher was good for 6 months. By the time I came back to California the voucher had expired, but they were kind enough to extend my voucher.

The experience in the ocean was awesome. The water was beautiful. The sea lions swam right up to us. The fish were gorgeous. The entire ocean experience was amazing.

When we came back again they had to cancel because the owner is very ill. And still is from the sounds of it with serious health issues. We ordered 2 cameras but one was defective so they refunded us our money that week. Even though we had a few hiccups they made it right everytime. Obviously if you care about your money and time you will make sure to stay on top of them. They get busy so don't be afraid to keep calling and texting them asking for updates.< /text>

<Text>Complete scam, nobody answers the phone or shows up for the dive. When you dispute the charge on your credit card the owner then sends e-mail proof that you paid for the dive and filled out paperwork.

DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE.

< Review>
Friendly, experienced and very helpful guides. We loved it. I was taking my 11-year-old son out on his first solo dives since becoming certified and SD Expeditions made it a wonderful experience for both of us. We got to see a lot more than we would have on our own since they do all the navigating and know exactly where to look. The gear was all very nice and having it dropped off and set up for us right on the beach was SO much better than renting, hauling, washing and returning rental gear. We will be calling them again next time we're in town!< /Review>

<Text>Good:
-Being able to reschedule my dive last minute after I came down with a head cold. Even though I was inside the 48hr window when I called to reschedule the process was hassle free and I did not incur any additional fees. That kind of flexibility will result in return customers.
-Small dive groups make for such a better experience
-Emily was both personable and professional. I enjoyed diving with her.

Bad:
-none

Others:
-Next time I would pass on the canyon dive and instead opt for two cove dives.<//Text>< Pictures>

Went with some friends and stumbled on a Hammerhead.  An experience like no other!  Nick and Mark gave us a first class ride.  Treated us very well, were very enthusiastic about the tour.   Explained everything in detail as we went to the dive sites.  Provided all equipment and fed us well.  Just a great all around experience.  I would highly recommend them to my friends and hope to return soon.< /Review>

<text>Nick and staff are one in a million. Professional, knowledgable, patient, kind...it doesn't get any better than this. Our two tank shore dive was awesome and memorable. As a beginner diver and first time in the Pacific Ocean, I was very satisfied with every moment as well as the overall experience. There's no doubt I'll bring my family back to dive with SD Expeditions and wouldn't think of diving with anyone else!

Don't forget to check out Upwelling Fine Art Gallery. The underwater photography is amazing.<//text><Date>1434732364786< /Date><UserId.>108810156901532374131<//UserId.>< GmapID>

These were some of the quotes that came from my friends during a full day Blue shark tour with SD Expeditions. Nick is the BEST sharkman in the business at sharing his passion for sharks while facilitating the safetest encounter possible. Our trip encounters included time with whales, dolphins, kelp paddies, and of course Blue Sharks. The boat/crew/equipment are all top rate with zero sacrifice on quality. When dealing with the true wild side of ocean animals, why would you want to save a few bucks. Go with the best and remove all doubt about having a great experience.

This experience was unforgettable! I was too chicken to actually dive in the water but watching my fiancé and everyone else, enticed me to try it out next time. Even being on the boat was so much fun and we can’t thank Nick enough for being such an informative and fun guide (we even watched him on shark week yesterday). My fiancé hasn’t stopped talking about it! Already planning trip #2!< /Review>

Terrible misleading company who promise you a video and photo package on the boat and after generously leaving a good tip & yelp reviews Nick has failed to follow through horrific service filled with empty promises! Nick is a stone cold liar !!!</Text>

This is my hardest critic... The staff on the boat was great..and after the dive N  reach out to me and try to correct it . But I was fooled on my dive and this is info  more for the next divers..  the boat dive is nothing to compare to the cove and cave dive..not the same spot..so when you ask for a dive ...be very specific...kelp and wreck or cove and animals...</review>

<text>Having dove with a multitude of companies all over CA and the world, I can say without a doubt that SD Expeditions is the best team in and out of the water. Perfect for locals or out of towners. Whether you are looking to become certified, snorkel, or go on their highly touted shark dives, you will experience the highest level of customer service and ocean education.

Went to dive on April 28th. The dive masters were all right, very professional, but we had absolutely no visibility at all. I wouldn't recommand the shore dives there was a lot of current and I only saw 8 fishes in 2 dives ... No seal, shark, sea lion as I thought I would, plus the water is really cold, 11°C...<//Text>

<text>SD Expeditions far exceeded my expectations.  I chose them based on many good reviews here.  I was very nervous as this was my first ocean dive, having recently been certified but my open water check offs were in a lake, and it was not the best experience.   I ended up being the only diver with the dive master, which made for a great first experience.  Karma was my dive master and she was very patient with me, was a great teacher, and a great dive master.  I did 2 dives with her at La Jolla.  We did the canyon wall, followed by the cove/kelp forrest.

Alice was also great on communicating with me.  I set everything up by email.  Alice was great at responding within a short time and making sure I had all that I would need the day of my dive.  I set everything up the day before I dove and was able to do all of that with short notice.

I definitely would recommend them to anyone looking for experienced dive masters that know the dive area well, are passionate about their dive location, and are great teachers too!< /text>< gmapID>

The two days my sons and I spent exploring the Pacific with SD Expeditions were exceptional.  Kyle and Nick provided an incredible experience teaching and showing us the breathtaking sea life. of the Ocean  They provided adventurous - and safe - opportunities to see amazing animals, supplying and expertly managing our equipment along with a beautiful boat for the journey.  We swam with hundreds of dolphins, sea lions, spotted sharks, studied the reef and its crustaceous critters and swam through the kelp forrest.  This is one the best gifts I have given to my sons.<//text>

Worked with these guys to set up three dives: two during the day and one at night.  First day dive to the canyon went smoothly but didn't seem all that interesting.  Second dive of the day, out of La Jolla cove, wow! What a fantastic dive! Lots of lobsters, Girabaldi, and swimming through the kelp was amazing! Our night dive was a return to the canyon from our first dive.  WHAT A CHANGE!! If we hadn't dove that site that morning I would never have believed it was the same site! The stark contrast between night and day really made both of the dives worth it if only because you can then really understand the differences between the two.

Our dive master, John, was absolutely fabulous.  Friendly, helpful, and absolutely funny, he kept our group together and made the swim enjoyable.  Nick and Taylor were more than accommodating when it came to booking flexibility and to our group's request to try on a wet suit the day before our scheduled dives.

I would absolutely work with this crew again. Next time (there will be a next time!) we'll hopefully get a boat run!</Text>

<text>Have had two awesome experiences with this company. First, I joined Nick and the crew on one of the Blue and Mako Shark Expeditions. Not only did we have the opportunity to swim with a Blue Shark, but we also encountered a pod of dolphins and a Mola Mola.

Two months later, I signed my girlfriend up for a PADI open water course. She completed her course with SD Ex instructor Patricia, who she loved. Despite having equalizing issues, which set her back, SD Expeditions took the time and effort to individually finish her certification. She was thrilled.

Huge thanks to Nick and the team at SD Expeditions. Would 10/10 recommend to a friend.<//text></record></dataset><record>
<review>Phenomenal diving with SD Expeditions!  We had two dives: La Jolla Shores and La Jolla Cove.  I absolutely loved the Cove and was fortunate to have my own personal dive with Dive Master Katie.  Katie was extremely professional, friendly, and had thorough knowledge of the marine life and ecosystem.  We were bummed to have missed the hammerhead that was hanging around the area that afternoon, but we did get to see quite a few other animals.  Also, diving through the kelp beds was a new and fun experience.  I really loved my dives with SD Exp and can’t wait to come back for more diving – I highly recommend diving with this crew!</review>< userid>

< Review>
I booked my 100th dive with SD Expeditions and rented a car to drive out to La Jolla for the morning. (I was in town for a conference)

The water was fantastic!  Nick guided me on a tour of the reef nearby, showing me kelp, snails, sarcastic fish, eels, and the biggest halibut I've ever seen.  I went to take a picture of an orange slug... but the rock next to it was actually an octopus!  We spent time looking through all the sand dollars, fish, and everything else that was around.  On the safety stop, I thought we saw another octopus buried in the sand, but as I got closer, it was a skate.

It was too early in the year for sharks, but it was an amazing dive with a great operator.  I felt safe, the gear was in great shape, and the dive was fantastic.  I would highly recommend using SD Expeditions, and I would not hesitate to book another dive with them the next time I'm in San Diego.<//Review>

<Text>We made two dives with Nick from SD Expeditions in June. SD Expeditions provided us with excellent service and were very quick replying to emails. Nick is a very professional guide, he was happy to take it slow to make sure we felt comfortable and safe. He explained the procedures and the dive site very well. Even though visibility was only 6-8 m, Nick spotted lots of cool stuff from what seemed to be miles away.

Because at SD Expeditions they always dive in small groups (even just the three of us this time), there is a very personal and relaxed atmosphere. The rental gear was in excellent condition and included a sunto zoop computer.

Overall, we had a superb diving experience with SD Expeditions, with the highlight of seeing a sevengill shark! It was a great day and we would happily dive with SD Expeditions again. Recommended!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dc01526bbd3249:0x8f38b63108060962<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

AMAZING!

Ok, so before I'd decide to schedule the 2 dive sessions with SD Expeditions I reaches a lot. They not the cheapest place, but certainly the BEST in San Diego area.
The representative I talked to on the phone was super nice and informative, answered every question I had and was very patient (comparing to other dive San Diego stores I talked to).
Order process was easy and detailed. After the order I got 2 email, 1st receipt and confirmation and 2ed specification of my order and detailed instructions for dive day (things to bring and meeting point).
One of their biggest advantages, is that all the equipment will meet you at the diving site and you don't need to pick it up yourself from the store.
Second advantage, is that the equipment was super new and top quality! Everything worked like magic (and I'm very picky about it).
Third advantage, Frank! Superb dive master..!! Years of experience and a lifetime of personality. Informative, professional, nice and interactive. Hell of a guy!
Rather than that, Nick the owner was wonderful as well. Seems like Nick's great personality and atmosphere applies at all SD Expeditions interactions and outcomes, hope I'll meet more dive store owners like him!
Last thing, the dive was fabulous..!! We saw decent amount of marine life: several different kinds of fish, lobsters, octopus, the famous Kelp, lots a ocean weed, and the best was swimming with seals...!! The seals actually playing with you underwater (a thing that our instructors, Frank, explained us how to play with the and not scare them).

2 things to keep in mind - general to dive at San Diego:
1. After scheduling your dive, make sure several days before the dive everything I'd OK.
2. Keep in mind that during Fall and Winter the ocean can be rough/stormy for several days a row, so your dive could not be executed in the schedule day and it will be postpone.

Thank you Nick and SD Expeditions crew!
Hope to c you guys Oh My God...

<Review>These guys (Nick/Kyle) really work hard to please on the blue/mako expedition. Most of the day there was no current to help spread the chum and they either were trolling or were busy in the water nonstop trying to make sounds that attract the sharks which is very manually intensive. When no sharks were seen by 4PM which is usually the end of the expedition, they went another 2 hours past time and we did find 2 sharks, of which all we saw were the definite shark fins/bodys (looked like a mako and a small great white) about 70 yards out...yes it would have been absolutely perfect to have the shark come in and play with us, but nature is what it is, and the guys really worked hard at trying to bring them in and even felt overtly bad that the sharks didn't come right up to the boat (offered a discount for a future use which was nice). It was cool seeing multiple dolphin pods, humpback whales, seals, swimming in the deep, and even seeing the different sharks even from a distance. Nice to only be one of 4-5 participants and to be accommodated to and not feel pressured.Will definitely try at this again in the future with SD expeditions as it is sometimes just a numbers game to swimming up close.

<Date>1438030389655< /Date><Review>Our family is new to diving, with just recently getting our PADI open water cert in Hawaii.  We wanted to try our first dive closer to home, and chose La Jolla.  Being complete beginners, and looking to dive in a completely different environment, the search was on to find a local company that would supply the gear, and guidance so that we dove safely, and enjoyed ourselves.  After a lot of searching, we decided on SD Expeditions.  We let them know up front we were complete rookies.  When we met in the morning for the Dive there were 5 divers, and two guides from SD.  The other 2 divers were more experienced, so they split off with one of the other guides.  We went with Nick LeBeouf, and it was an incredible experience.  He was understanding of our limitations as new divers, and helped us every step of the way.  The gear provided was great quality and condition.  After diving in Hawaii, dropping to depth in 7 mil gear, with extra weight, lower visibility, and more surge than we'd ever experienced, my first thought was, "You're not in Kansas anymore".  Nick was there the whole time, watching over myself and my family, showing us an awesome Kelp forest, and all the underworld wild-life, including a few sharks.  Once we made our ascent I found out my daughter had an issue equalizing and her ears were bothering her a bit, and my wife was feeling a little sea-sick from the surge.  Nick came to me, letting me know the second dive was probably not a good idea.  I completely agreed with him, and I let my wife and daughter know we would not be doing the second dive.  On top of this, he refunded us for 1/2 the dive since we didn't do the second dive.  You pay a little bit more to dive with SD Expeditions, but you are essentially getting a private guided dive, catered to your specific abilities. We are already planning our next trip to La Jolla, and we would not even consider using anyone else.  These guys are awesome!  Thank you Nick and team!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><gmap_id>0x80dc01526bbd3249:0x8f38b63108060962< /gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate><Resp>{'time': 1438897128035, 'text': 'Thank you for the awesome review Charlie!

Really great facility, everywhere is clean, but there was this one time, when I was playing, and this kid punched me for no reason whatsoever. And the staff didn't even care. But, everything else is good, including the basketball programs.</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The building design is very trendy, spacious and comfortable, the environment is clean and air-conditioned, the water dispenser has excellent taste and the cost of use is sufficient to take care of the public's health. We like it very much!

It seems like they just threw left overs on the plate because they were about to close within 30 mins.

I literally live 3 mins away! I love Waba Grill but I don't know if I'll be going back.

Management this is ridiculous!!</text>< Pics>

Horrible manager. Great customer service and great food but manager was very rude and speaks unmannerly. Yells at employees and very non-professional. Manager's name was Palvi. Please have her fired. Thanks.<//Review>

The two guys that served us didn’t care. The guy making the food would leave to the back for like 5 mins and would come back and make one bowl at a time and then leave again. They took 25 minutes to make 2 bowls and people got their order before us. Waba grill is good but the workers here suck.</text>

<text>I like to give people a chance and just say hey maybe they were having a bad day but by the looks of the reviews around the customer service they really do not seem to know what good customer service is. There was only 1 lady working at the register and cooking plus she did not want anyone eating eating in did not even ask you if you're dining in or out lol. She seemed miserable and I hope she is not the owner. Hope they turn it around...</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Fantastic place to get something quick to eat.The chicken and rice bowl is the best! I'd say it's better than Panda and other Asian inspired "fast food" establishments because it's not greasy at all. The location is very clean and nicely set up. Food is fantastic and on the healthier side. Prices are also very reasonable and affordable.</Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>So sad in this day and age of Restaurants Galore that Waba Grill has become the latest price gouger out there. Is Gouger even a word? Perhaps Not.  Walked in here tonight with the intention of getting my Grub on... sadly it would Not happen. Waited a couple of minutes for the girl to come to the register. Noticed prices went up (not terribly, just a few cents here and there).  Went to order my staple, The Waba Signature Plate.  Was told, quite rudely, that I would have to pay Extra since I didn't want Rice. Sure, penalize me for wanting to be healthy. No More Waba for me!! I'm done with them. So sad cause I really liked their food. However, with an extra charge for being healthy  and a side of attitude, No Thank you.  Judging by the crowd in there.  2 people, they Probably could've used my order of 8 Plates!  Hungry family at home will Now be disappointed.  However with 10 Gazillion places to eat out there, I'm sure I'll find a substitute.

Waba Grill's Motto:

At WaBa Grill we are committed to providing our customers an enjoyable dining experience, serving the finest quality meals.

Our foundation is based on healthy eating with low calorie, low carb and high protein options.

We are the place for healthy food options on-the-go.

Lesson 1) Don't have an attitude with your customer.
Lesson 2) Don't boast "Eating Smart and Being Healthy"  then penalize a customer for wanting to do Just That.
Lesson 3) There are MANY places that offer Healthy Food Options on-the-go!

Funny just a month ago I was in here and I ordered my standard, which incidentally included No Rice, and the gal not only made my food to order, she actually gave me avocado at NO Charge. Funny how a New Year and Perhaps new ownership changes things???<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxKGgcfldPyMhta5V9AWR1q1tGKnNrg1gxUSNy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>My food was cold. The rice was hard and old. The 3 employees that were there were young. They act like they didn't know what they were doing. I wasn't happy. Also it didn't smell like Waba. It smelled like urine. The BEST Waba Grill is in Chatsworth, Ca. Y'all need lessons from them. They are very welcoming, happy and speak to you when you come in... I didn't get that from this one on Soledad Canyon Rd. If I can give them a zero I would. In my book they don't deserve a one< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Horrible!!! I was over charged for almost everything (4 meals). Manager said "corporate changed the prices a few days ago"  but they didn't change the prices on their menu to match. Three other people were there complaining about being over charged while we were there too. Manager was extremely rude. To make things worse my daughter and I both had bad stomach aches not long after we left!<//Review>

The food was consistent with that of Waba but the service was horrible. People that ordered after me received their food before me. I will never go back to the Canyon Country location. The Castaic location is much better.</text>

The lady taking the orders does not pay attention, I don't think she can understand what's being told. Twice I said no avocado and twice I was charged for it and when I complained, they said sorry nothing they could do, to top it off she insisted I said avocado. I know what I like and dont like to begin with, why would I ask for something I'm allergic to. This is my last time at this place.< /Review>

The lady at the register, who was the owner is so RUDE! I gave her a coupon for buy 2 drinks and a waba bowl and get a waba bowl free.  A tiny section of the coupon was ripped where it said two drinks and she would not honor the coupon!!! So I had to get the other part of the coupon to show her what it said bc she wouldn't take my word for it... She still refused even when I showed her the piece that was missing! I told her that she had bad customer service and that she is losing a customer! Lady if your gonna own a business you need to take a class in CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! But it makes sense now, why I never see anyone in this place...and she's the one to blame</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>believe Emerald Textiles is one of those companies that doesn't hire woman drivers.
I applied and was contacted by Frank which I believe is a manager at Emerald. When I came in for the interview I was informed that he wasn't available so I was interviewed by another person. In the interview I was told that the company was growing and that they were in need of many driver's to start immediately. As the interview went on I was offered a tour of the company, I noticed there weren't any woman drivers only in the back where the laundry is being serviced. I asked if there were any woman drivers and I was quickly told no. After the interview I was introduced to Frank which was the person who initially had called me in for the interview. He briefly said hi and continued on his computer. At the end of the tour I was told that if possible could I please provide an H6 whenever I had time. I knew they weren't interested right then because in the interview they said they needed drivers asap so y ask for an H6 whenever? I went on and brought my H6 and left in the the front because I was told Frank wasn't available to take it even though I had just text him. For days after dropping my H6 off I kept on texting Frank just to ask if he had gotten my H6 and he never replied. I continue on checking in with him and he still never replied. At that point I knew they weren't interested in hiring me and I really had no idea y because I have a clean driving record, have had my CDL class A since 2006 and I have lots of experience in the field. Still I decided to leave it alone and move on since it was clear Frank wasn't going to reply to my text messages. About a week or so later I received a call from another person there and I was asked to come in for a ride along with another driver. When I got there Frank was there and he walked me over to the driver I was going to be riding with, he then told me that after the ride along I would be contacted Monday to see what I thought about the job and if I liked it I would then be offered a job and would talk about training and the next steps. The ride along wasn't bad I just had to watch what the job was about and that was pretty much it. Today is Wednesday and i hadn't heard from anyone over at Emerald I text Frank yesterday and as usual he didn't reply. Today I finally heard from him and he apologized saying I thought Russ had gotten back to you. Sorry we went with another candidate. I replied No problem thanks! I personally believe he was never going to hire me so y waste my time and secondly y say a different candidate as if they were only hiring one person when it was clear in the interview they needed many driver's?<//Text>< Pictures>

We called and made an appointment for 3 pedicures
We show up on time.  They had us pick a color.  This place is jammed pack.  We sat and waited.  30 minutes later, 2 of us were seated.  I waited so my daughters could go first.  1:15 and I am beyond irritated.  In the mean time they continue to take calls for appointments....Why????  I don't appreciate that they don't value others time.  I will not go back.  My daughters were happy with their package.<//Review>

<rate>3</rate><review>I frequent this place because I love their spa pedicure.  Some of the manicurist are a bit older and tend to be kind of lazy.  I usually get amazing pedicures with a 15 minute massage.  It is the most expensive package but it is worth it for my feet!!!  A couple of observations I have made.  They do horrible with scheduling.  I saw them tell so many people to come back but did not write their names down.  They were not organized.  .I picked a color which was way too light once they applied it.  I told them it didn't look like the color on the sample and asked if I could change the color.  They ended up just putting another color on top and refused to take it off.  The second color was lumpy and did not come out good.  I was so tired at that point I just let it be.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dcd6001b5357f1:0x3b567bff86b6bc5f</gmapID></record>

This salon, on appearance, has all the latest upgrades in terms of construction, etc. however, the chemicals were so strong I had trouble breathing and by the end of it I was so thankful to get out of there I felt convinced that staying longer one could have a heart attack... too many chemicals and not enough oxygen/airflow.

Under new management was very dissatisfied  the pedicure felt like a 4yr old was massaging me!! Her name was Cathy !!  Then I  went on to get a manicure same girl cathy & no massage just a real quick  clean up of nails & polished them and that's it!!!😥 I  made an appointment for manicure 1st and wanted my regular Jenny  to no avail left very disappointed I will try one more time & be very specific who I want & if that don't work I will look for another place I been going there for 25yrs I'm sad😥💅</Review>

<review>Horrible place ! They are so rude and always speaking about you. They added extra charges without even asking me. When I was about to pay the lady that did my nails had already left and they called her to see if I was lying. And she demanded to speak to my mom and then to speak to me! She was just ridiculous. I will never come here again. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL! Horrible two ladies that attended me. Absolutely ridiculous<//review>< pics>

WORST EXPERIENCE ! I don't even know where to begin.. The lady working on my feet was more into gossip than working. And the one working on my hands just wanted to get it done. They rushed through it and we're trying to convince me to get a different job. I wanted acrylic tips and dark purple gel polish. They kept telling me that the acrylic will break and that nails grow fast either way. I'm pretty sure I know what I'm asking for. Anyways, I walked out before they finished because my finger nails were hurting and that's never happened before. I hope they didn't ruin my nails! 😖< /Text>

<Review>Loved my nails and they did an excellent job on my feet, too. My feet and hands desperately needed some tender, love, and care. It was a mess and they were able to make it look beautiful. On my nails, I got gel for the first time. I loved it! The price is decent while the service is spectacular. Highly recommended.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I went in asking for a mani and pedi but the man at the front shooed me away saying he has a very long wait and couldn't take walk ins. I asked what time they would be available and if I had to make an appointment before hand, but he interrupted me and said until 2...4 hours later. Honestly so rude. A d to be honest, now that I'm looking at all their reviews, I'm glad I didn't go through with it. STAY AWAY!!</Text>

<Review>Horrible service!! I asked how much was their mani -pedi and she said basic was $19, then she said if you want few more minutes spent on your feet, then it cost $24.  She gave me the clear impression , they were going to be adding charges left and right.  But I gave them a chance because maybe it was a language barrier.  The moment I sat down,  there were no massage chairs and sure enough,  thd girl began to say,  I need this and that done to my feet (which are really decent feet), each time she added $5. ..she was trying to sale me off...bad service,  not clean , don't risk getting ripped off ...<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dcd6001b5357f1:0x3b567bff86b6bc5f</gmap_id>< Date>

<text>Do not waste your time... so i got my nails on thursday and by saturday the nail polish started chipping off this has never happened to me. They have a very small selection of colors. The ladies are rude my sister complained about how a nail was crooked she told her, her fingers are crooked when my sis responded if all her fingers are crooked then? She rolled her eyes and handed her the nail filer told her to fix it the way she wants.... client behind me wanted purple french tip they misunderstood her and painted her whole nail purple when she complained about it i heard the asian lady tell her oh my god you never told me that and then told her to let her do her job shes the specialist... never have i experienced such bad customer service and nail work ..will never return to this spot!!<//text><user_id>117272536447350321873</user_id></record>

<review>Very very disappointed!!! As we all use to love coming here before they closed for the atmosphere of grill cooking and good food. WELL that is no longer the case!! Do not expect to be able to sit at grill if your party is less than 8 as they take larger party’s before small ones. EVEN if your told they have room for 4 to seat at grill. We talked with them when we came in and was told they only had a large party of 32 at 6, I asked how many grills they had going, how many chefs and was informed we were good for seating, we only had less than 10 minutes for our two friends to show up. WITHIN that 10 once we said we were all here we were informed  they had no room for us and we’d have to sit at regular table cause they have also a 20 party coming in. So basically that party kicked us out to be seated so they could get bigger party in. They are about the money and not the customers experience!! They literally lied to our face and did not care we were upset!  ——5< /review>< Pics>

Very chaotic. First off had to wait for 2 ppl in our party to arrive before seated although majority were present.
Forgot our party's soups and salads. Food was prepared in oddly manner. Almost like he forgot to incorporate items then remembered after. Got my steamed rice after I was almost finished with my food. Smh!
Hopefully they get it together. It use to be our favorite place. We'll see how the improve.< /review>

Ordered the spicy ramen and was not good at all. Definitely have had a lot better. I'm sure they might have other dishes that are good but would not order from there again.< /Review>

For Doordash they have you wait in your car outside and say they’ll send you a message when your food is ready which is totally fine but, they did not message me and when I went in to check 10 mins after my pick up time it had been sitting there. They didn’t tell me it had been ready/even talk to me when I came to check on why it had been such a wait.<//Text>

1st time here && probably the last time. Food was good. But when other chefs were cooking for the other tables all I smelled was garlic when our food was cooking no garlic. We weren't served dipping sauces I figured they weren't doing them until I saw a table after us get served it and no sprouts. There were 4 of us that came, the back of the menu said 18% gratuity for groups of 8, well we were still charged that. Servers were slow. We were all super disappointed.< /text>

We have been here a few times and love the food and the staff.  They always make the dinner fun.  It definitely needs some updating.  I read the next week that it has new owners that are doing just that.  They closed temporarily to give it a face lift.  We are looking forward to seeing what it looks like when it reopens.< /Review>

<Review>The grill is a great experience for a family outing or going out with friends, great form of entertainment with a meal. The bartenders kept up with the drinks we were ordering with the exception of one they've never heard of. Still made it to the best of their ability, came out great! Would like to be able to be seated without having my full party there.<//Review>< user_id>

<review>What a fun spot! This unassuming place has a down to earth quality about every aspect of it. Enter the door and prepare to be greeted by two energetic ladies making custom sandwiches in a flash. All the choices have a person's name. Orders to go are written on a paper bag, those eating in write it on an index card. Everything is assembled fresh before your eyes and they will build a sandwich to your specifications. Walk outside and in another door to select drinks and dessert.<//review>< pics>

<Text>I would give it zero star if I could! We went for our anniversary and I was extremely dissappointed. The place was nasty! I wanted to leave once I sat down. The tables were sticky it felt like they never been cleaned the tables. The food was not even great. Not even worth my money. And the way they did tricks like tossing food into your mouth and accidentally fell on the stove they still did the trick again. I was so grossed out that it even touched the stove and table before it went back into the mouth. I wouldnt even waste your time our money. I have no idea how they even pass health inspection it is so gross< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><time>1566689726145</time>< username>

They accommodated us super quick, we went early in the middle of the week and it was a pleasant time. The only down side was that there was not any sushi during the week. We had fun & our chef was great.</Text>

Quite frankly giving them 1 star is kind. The wait wasn’t terrible HOWEVER once we were sat they completely forgot about us, finally when we were noticed and placed our order 3 entire items were forgotten normally soup and salad are brought out in the beginning they were not brought out until we asked for them the server seemed apologetic and went as far as to give my wife a complementary soup and salad as well (which was nice) the chef tried his best to make the experience enjoyable but the place is ran down and in serious need of a remodel food wasn’t terrible but not worth the price that’s for sure! All I’m saying is do yourself a favor and go somewhere else! (DISCLAIMER THE ONLY GOOD PART OF OUR DINNER WAS THE SERVER SHE APOLOGIZED AND WENT AS FAR IS TO GIVE US A FREE DINNER TO MAKE UP FOR THE ITEMS THAT WERE FORGOTTEN WHICH IS WHY IM LEAVING THE 3 STARS!)</Review>

<review>Sorry to say but this is not a family restaurant if that's what you are looking for. It's straight out a bar it was karaoke night so it was really loud but that's fine because there is people that like this. My real problem was that me and my family were standing there for 25 minutes and no one helped us or pay attention so we just left.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Place used to be very good.  After trying for 3 days to get a reservation, finally got one and still had to wait a long time to place order and have cook cone to grill. Ginger sauce was horrible.<//Review>

Wish I could leave zero stars. Went in with a total party of two and was told it would be a 10 to 15 minute wait. Went to the bar and was served quite quickly. Ended up waiting an extra 30 minutes after the 15 minutes. Finally sat down with another family and the dad and I had some fun conversation and that's what allowed me to give a one star. We sat for a total of an hour and ten minutes baking in the hot room with four hot grills and no air flow. Ended up walking out. We have been going here for 4 years occasionally per year and this was by far the worst. Never coming here again.< /Review>

<text>I enjoyed the family atmosphere. It is not as loud compared to other sushi restaurants in Modesto, CA. However, the sushi is a little above average and that's it. The tables and chairs are old looking. The owners were very nice and complimenting to our needs. Prices is comparable to others and the location is perfect for a quick sushi run.</text>< Pics>

<text>I firmly believe I will never have a restaurant experience as terrible as last night at Tori's.  We made a reservation for 8pm for a group of 30.  4 of our group arrived 20 minutes early. Right at 8 PM we had 10 people there. They wouldn't seat us as the entire party hadn't arrived.  At 8:10 we had 20 people. They go ahead and seat us,  however only 15 of our party can be seated because they had just seated a large group despite our reservations for 30.  Needless to say,  half of our group was standing in the hallway,  some at the bar. ... waiting for a group of 15 who just started eating to clear out.  They give us menus and try to begin taking our orders- all while half of our group hasn't been seated.  This was rude, and I'm pleased that my group decided not to begin ordering.  At this point we had enough, we called a nearby restaurant who was able to accommodate our group and we left- all 30 of us. We grabbed our belongings and took our business elsewhere. The manager - or we assumed she was the manager was very unprofessional.  They shouldn't take reservations if they aren't going to reserve the area.  We would have understood if we didn't have a single person there by 8pm- but we had 10 people there.  This was terrible service, if I could review with 0 stars I would.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x809055cc228ae323:0xb6d79f9933a275d<//Gmap_id></record>

Worst experience ever! Restaurant has gone down hill. Dishes were dirty. Asked for new dishes.. still dirty. Restaurant was dirty. Went for a birthday, ordered sake bombs, and after they bring out all the stuff they tell us all they have no shot glasses and still charged us. Reservation was at 7 30, didnt get seated until after 8. Screwed up several orders. Food was good however. But will never go back.</Review>

<review>Went last night. Food was good if you want to wait for an hour for the chef to start cooking and half an hour more to start eating. All this with having a reservation and being on time. Also the hostess had a terrible attitude. Waitress was good.< /review><rating>2<//rating><user_name>Harman Bains<//user_name><pics>None<//pics><userid>117577551244613242174</userid>< gmap_id>

<time>1468187807354< /time><rating>2</rating><Text>Our family experienced everything mentioned in these reviews:  Great food, but indifferent service.  Our appetizers weren't served -- they were forgotten --  and since a couple of us were just having those -- they didn't eat with the rest of us.  Our chef put on a fine presentation and the steak, chicken, and vegetables were wonderful.  Other reviewers noted that Torii's has a seating issue.  We made reservations for 7, and our party of 11 was all present, but we weren't seated until 7:40.   And the we never did figure out the Karaoke line-up.  Apparently some of the regular octogenarian crooners are able to reserve multiple spots and block out newcomers for a long time.  We kept saying, "Yep, the reviewers warned us."< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

This is a great establishment! It is a good crowd of people that spend their time here!! Mostly locals, karaoke on fridays, with a stage and a bar. The Teppan-Yaki tables are located in the back, and they are definitely antique! Our cook was funny as hell! All in all good food, and reasonable prices.</Review>

The service was absolutely ridiculous. We had reservations for 7pm for a party of 10 on a Thursday night and we're not seated till 8:30pm. No drinks were offered to us and we had to ask for free appetizers cause everyone was beyond upset at this point. We sat at the table for another 30mins still no drinks, appetizer was brought but finally after all this time our party couldn't waste anymore of our time. If we were to have stayed it wouldn't have put us home till well after 11pm on a night we all have to be up early the next day for work. It had already been two hours and not a single drink was brought to us. I am so extremely disappointed in this place. It doesn't even matter how good their food may be service like this is not acceptable in any business. I suggest every person that works there get there act together and learn how to run a restaurant. They will be losing a ton of business due to this tonight. To top it all off we were not the only group that walked out tonight. Two other groups that I saw walked out as well. I highly suggest to anyone wanting to go here to rethink it and try somewhere else.< /text>

Unimpressive! The restaurant looks very run down and not well kept. The chefs were very entertaining and the food was so-so. Mostly, I am giving a 1 for the service. We had a large party and the timing was very inconsistent and made it feel as though we were not one group. Sushi was still arriving after we had finished eating and at least one person didn't get to eat until all others had finished. After finishing the meal, the manager/owner (not sure which) basically told us to leave because others were waiting for a table. Sooooo RUDE! I couldn't believe that she would be so insulting, especially after we had spent over $300!</Text>

Place is dirty, gave us stained napkins and dirty silverware. Super expensive for small portion, unseasoned food. They didn't even have sushi for a sushi restaurant. They were unorganized and not friendly.  Took almost an hour to get a waitress to our table, and not that many people were there. Not going back ever again.</text>

Great entertainment with our dinner. Very interactive and fun for our group. They will not seat you unless your whole party is present, so beon time for reservations! The food was a little bland, but nothing a little soy sauce or teriyaki couldn't fix. Great prices.</Review>

So dirty. Sushi was terrible and falls apart. You might be better off driving to Benihana. If you've never been to a Teppanyaki place, don't let Torii be your first experience.< /Text>

Bad service. They said it was going to be a 15 minutes wait to be seated. It took more than 30 minutes to tell us that in 3 minutes she would have a table to us but it was going to be an hour to get the food because they were short staff. She could said that since the beginning.< /Text>

I went to Toriis for the Karaoke. One time I got there at 6:30 (it is supposed to start at 7:00 pm)  and at 8:00, it hadn't started yet and the karaoke MC went outside for a smoke...so I left. I went there today  and arrived at 7:00 pm, when it's supposed to start. It started at 7:15 and I sang the first song, Roy Orbison's, "Running Scared,"  (i am known as an excellent singer) and the fellow said his boss wants him to sing the first four songs...so I left. If you are going for the karaoke, I can't recommend Toriis. I won't go back.</Text>

Horrible. Usually I love Torii's but on Friday night it was so bad even the manager knew it. The tempura was cold and the veggies were still raw. The sushi was a warm and the rice was all gummy and mushy. Didn't taste fresh at all. The sushi lady was SUPER RUDE. The manager was very nice about it and comped our whole meal. I was happy with the way Mike handled the situation, I wouldn't have wanted to pay for any of that. Torii's has been scratched off my list for sure.<//text>

We took my brother out for Teppanyaki for his Twentieth Birthday, met my other brother. Everything was right, the chef, the waitresses and the karaoke. It was a blast watching him catch a zucchini his first time. I had the Sesame Chicken and a couple Salmon Roles. The Miso Soup is my favorite.</text>

I give it 1 star because that's the lowest choice.
We walked in and waited for 8 mimutes before we saw anyone that works there. The lady that finally did come told us 'oh', no! We only seat people with reservations. I said ok, lets go somewhere else. Then she said 'wait and I will see if I can squeeze you in somewhere.' she came back and said she had found 1 table that had room for is. It was with 2 other groups. We said ok.
I ordered the Seafood Boat and my husband ordered the steak and chicken. A waitress brought is each about a 4th of a cup of 'soup' and we were told to drink it but be careful, it's hot. Then hubby was brought a salad.and I was brought my seafood boat. The cook like to have scared is silly when he came to the door of the room and shouted 'its showtime!'
My 'boat' insisted of scallops (absolutely no flavor) prawns (again, over cooked and no flavor) and calamari (so over cooked it was like rubber and impossible to chew) the vegetables were warm. Raw, but warm. Hubbys steak was very tough. He could only eat about half of it. He said the chicken was 'ok' but the veggies were half raw.
And it was so noisey I didn't even try to talk. I mean, the cook was very loud and noisey.
Well, I have now been to Torii's so that is out of the way and I won't have to wonder how the food is. ....Terrible!<//Review>

<review>I went to Tori's on a Friday nite around 9pm for the first time with friends. It's was okay considering...the hostess was M.I.A at the doorway. The place was packed with on-lookers in the front lounge/karaoke area hearing / watching in fright at the high pitched shrilling karaoke rendition of "phantom of the opera."

We would have waited forever if it wasn't for the smart thinking of my friend. We sat down and when the waitress asked us what we would like for drinks, I asked for cold sake. She didn't know if they had cold sake but knew they only carried two. Two? As wait staff new or old, you should know what's on hand.  I sushi chef knew what kind of cold sake the establishment had. We ordered the Nigiri, with shot glasses. We're going enjoy this night. Sad to say, the waitress came back and said they didn't have any more Nigiri, WTF! Really? For a Friday nite an establishment should be fully stocked to quench customer's who have had a ridiculously amazing week. So we just drank free tap water.

We ordered appetizers which took forever, so we ordered our sushi rolls. We were not in a hurry, but hungry. The sushi chef did double duty being sushi maker and waitress since we didn't have chopsticks or napkins. We ordered our appetizers which came late, after we went through our sushi rolls. The sushi rolls were good like any other place. The only thing was they fell apart easily.

Overall, if you want karaoke, sushi, Teppanyaki , and spotty service, Tori's is the place for you.

There are other sushi places in Modesto with less noise, comparable prices, sushi and better service.</review>< Pics>

Kat was an amazing person. She cuts and styles great hair, gives great advice, and creates a welcoming environment for everyone. Found a coupon online too for $8.99 haircut, so that was nice. Would definitely recommend</text>

<review>I always go to this location for my haircut. Today had the worst experience at great clips. Wait time was way longer than it was showing on the system. Except my stylist Donna the other two stylists waisted their time and just chilled. I will not go to great clips anymore.</review>< date>

I should have waited for all of the stylists to get back into practice. I have completely straight hair, so every snip of th scissors is visible and needs to be blended. I clearly should have explained that to my stylist... Oh wait.. that is THEIR job..  not happy, might go to another chain in the future.< /review>

Rarely the same person is there but the price is good and the service is nice. I take my 8 year old son there and he's never had a bad cut. In fact, they've all been quite good.<//text>

<Text>Great Clips is a fabulous place to have my hair done.  The shop is quieter than the one on Natomas by Raley's and the staff is much nicer and much friendlier.  I have seen Tonya for my haircuts and she has addressed problems that I have had with my hair.  She is always friendly but professional.   She has ALWAYS cut my hair just the way I want it not the way she THINKS I should wear it.  She stops and listens to what I want.  I could NOT have asked for anyone better.  She will be THE ONE to cut my hair from now on.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1581887045081, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review, Jan!

My hair was down past my back and I had a picture of a multiple angle shot of a ruffled pixie cut. Courtney gave me a fantastic haircut and I came in a month later to get it trimmed. I'm very happy with my results and I'll be arriving again later this month for another trim. Totally recommend this place. But be warned,this great clips doesn't do hair color.< /text>< user>

<review>My son, daughter, and I having been coming to this Great Clips location for 2+ years.  We always get great haircuts and good service.  The price is reasonable.  It can be busy at times, so I suggest using their app to check in before coming.< /review>< pictures>

Good cuts and no frills for a straight up haircut for a dude. I've been going to Great Clips for about 15 years, having dozens upon dozens of good haircuts with only one over that span that I can remember that wasn't particularly good. Basically, what that means is that I've had 99% good haircuts there. The staff seems pretty cool too and allows you to talk as much as you want. Some days guys want Chit Chat, while other days you just want to sit and get cut.</Text>

The haircut prices for men is very expensive even if you go in for a simple buzzcut, the pricing for men should be variable but its a chain so that won't be changing anytime soon. The online check-in is very convenient and basically lets you go in and not have to wait in the lobby for much time.<//review>< Response>

I have been coming here for a few years, I bring in my boy for a cut almost once a month. I like their online check- in, it saves a lot of time. Once in a while I will get a chic that isn't as skilled or as friendly as the others, but i would say my son is happy with his cut at least 95% of the time.<//text>

Have been coming here for over a year with both my boys. Today the three of us got haircut, there was just a minor issues with my sons  which has happen one time before and they had said they were going to write it down in the information for next time so it wouldn't happen again but they did it again and they told me the same thing. There was not a lot of waiting since I checked in online.<//Text>

Took my two year old to get a haircut.  We were only third in the cue and told it would be fifteen minutes, so I decided to wait.  Thirty minutes later, he wasn't in the chair yet and everyone seemed to have gone on a break, so I left.<//text>

<Review>Got my daughters hair cut here. Her hair was all one length and long. Asked for an inch off all the way around, her hair is eneven all different lengths and 3 inches shorter. The girl that did her hair has no clue how to do a simple trim in all one length hair. Very upset.<//Review>< Pictures>

Will not honor their front and center $7.99 haircut coupon on their store Facebook page.  There is no expiration mentioned on the big ad so why the false advertising?  What a waste of gas and time to come down here.</text>

I celebrated my nomination earlier this evening in this great place. Well we passed a sensational evening and the restaurant was no doubt one of the reasons for this fruitful meeting. The waiters  participated in a graceful manner, the cooking was yummy and my friends were so  cheerful. We shall absolutely come back again for more joyful events. thanks very much.<//Text>

There are not a lot of filipino restaurants in LA, but this is one of my favs! The food hear is so amazing and delicious. Also, everything is super fresh and made with love. My favorite dishes are the lumpia as well as the garlic rice because they are so flavourful. Try out this place, it’s a bit on the pricer side but it makes sense for how yummy it is!<//Review>

Just came here today for the first time, the food was delicious. Foods light but very tasty and made when you order, so the foods not siting there. The plates are decent, My family and I usually eat a lot so it was surprising we got full fast. The customer service was tremendous. The server was very helpful and friendly. He knew we were knew to the place and helped us, not like those other restaurant where you go in and they don't help at all and they leave you there to figure it out on your own.  Will definitely come back again. Thank you.</Review>

<Review>Finally! A Filipino restaurant that is delicious and does not serve pork. You won't miss it. I have nothing against pork, it's just too cloying and gamey. I do not eat pork as a flavor preference. Eagle Rock kitchen pays a very clean and delicious omage to Filipino Classics like chicken adobo and longganisa, both are made from chicken. I will definitely return and try the other dishes. It's a very small and manageable menu with enough variety for vegetarians as well. The chicken adobo it's slightly crispy and has the sauce served on the side. The sauce is meant to either pour over your garlic fried rice or dip the chicken into. I usually like a lot of sauce, but the flavorful marinated chicken has a little bit of crunch to it and the side of mixed vegetables is cooked al dente and has tasty savoriness to them. Exactly the way I like vegetables. When I asked about the combination plate, I found out that the corned beef is house-made, and it is available by itself or in combination with the other entrees. Apparently this place also caters. Instead of the usual pork dishes, you will find only beef, chicken, and milkfish as your main animal proteins. I usually do not order the frozen snow drinks that are at most Filipino restaurants, but I had to give theirs a try. It is snowy shaved ice with house made leche flan custard, purple yam, pecans, bananas, with activated chia seeds, and unsweetened evaporated milk. Delicious. All of the ingredients are made in house and without preservatives or artificial colors, as is the case with traditional halo halos. Small dishes included fried egg, sauteed vegetables, make for a handful of sides. Next time, I will have to try either the filipino-style beef ribs or a combination plate with their chicken longganisa and house-made corned beef, with garlic rice and yummy veggies.  They are not open on Fridays or Saturdays.  The rest of the week and their hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. They have a parking lot with a few spaces, but there should be ample street parking as well. Eagle Rock Kitchen is in a little strip mall on the intersection of Colorado Boulevard and Collegeview Avenue in Eagle Rock. Worth the trip if you want some clean, tasty, and pork free Filipino food that is just as good if not superior to the traditional tropes. Family-run, the service is genuinely friendly and focused on giving well-balanced meals..<//Review>< rating>

Geez. Eat here asap. Killer comfort Filipino food. Everything on this menu is savory AF. The chicken adobo and tapa are can't miss items. Other Filipino folks (older) frequent this place, it's a good sign. It's hidden Inna strip mall. I love this place and will be back.<//review>

Talented barbers, best haircuts I've ever gotten BUT as other reviewer said, they lag on appointments. I could be waiting for weeks to get put in. Also, the shop hours are not accurate. Instead of closing at 7 PM. The open sign is switched off by 4 or 5. I've been going somewhere else. 😒</review>

Currently only taking appointments. No where do they post or warn you about it until you show up to see a small sign taped to the front door.</text>

<Review>Best place in Perris for mens/boys haircuts. Sal does a superb job and takes his time. Only complaint would be the time it takes to get oneself in. This shop seems to be pretty popular and thus busy, so if you're looking to get in and out of there quick....not gonna happen. I suggest booking an appointment. Even then, waiting a bit is well worth it for the quality and workmanship the customer receives.</Review>< username>

Sal was the one who cut my hair. He apologized for the wait and held up a good conversation with me. I explained the kind of haircut that i wanted and truth be told I loved it. I definately recommend this place. I will be coming back for sure.< /text>< Pictures>

Upbeat music (reminds me of walshy fire from major lazer), friendly crowd, casual attire (I'm too lazy to dress up so I love casual places), yummy pitchers, and just an overall good time!! If you're insecure about your dancing, it's okay the people here are pretty encouraging and open~ Definitely coming back!< /text>< Gmap_id>

Perhaps one of the best "dive" bars in Newport Beach (and certainly the best along the water), this is the type of place where you can either let loose on a Friday night and play pool with friends or show up at 6 AM Saturday morning for your dosage of "Hair of the dog" (my only ever early morning beer was here, and that's because I wanted to see if the 6AM sign on the door was a misprint... turned out to be legit.)<//Text>

<text>Love this place! The decor is very trendy and nice ambiance. The place is also huge. Can't wait for the upstairs speakeasy to open. The bartender is also very attentive. Recommend the Smash Brothers cocktail. Good variety of seats for different party sizes.< /text><Date>1571116204873<//Date>< user_name>

I was a huge fan of Chances but was excited 5 years ago when a new direction was taken. Overall I like this bar. It's local, prices are decent and service is good even when packed. The pool tables get a little cramped but it's not bad. I'd say overall it's an above average dive bar.

I Miss Chances, but support Beach Ball...</Text>

<Text>Terrible service and attitude towards customers. Went there and tried to use a temporary jd ad my new one hadn’t come in yet. The bouncer said he can’t accept it so I showed him another ID and he got upset with me because I hadn’t used that ID in the first place. Asked me why I hadn’t used that one in the first place and I said because the other one was a valid ID to which he got immediately confrontational. Terrible attitude towards customers.</Text>< Date>

<review>This place is very low quality, the bar tender is super snippy and the guy in charge of the juke box doesn't know how to work the juke box machine. The music choice sucks, probably so you pay to play your own music. This place serves alcohol only, and has no bar food or finger food.  They have a few pool table, which was pay to play. The crowd is made up of those corporate type.<//review>< Pics>

Gotta be the coolest bar in Newport Beach!!!  The interior is crazy, looks like an old ship on the inside.  The bartenders are super cool and not bad beer prices for a place with a beach view< /Review>

<Text>I spent all my 20's living in Newport. This was my local spot that we went to pretty much every weekend.  Perfect location, right on the water down the newport boardwalk. It is a total dive bar. Dark, dingy, smells of beer and ocean breeze salt water. Has leopard print pool tables ha. They even have 10% IPAs on draft, at least they used to I haven't been back since I left Newport. What I loved about it was that it was never too crowded or had huge lines to get in, since it is not the cool spot to be at (like Muuts, Malarkys, Stag, Bluebeet). So it is not everything to everyone. But if you want a great dive bar right on the water and are looking to rip it up, this is your spot.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

One of our stops this past Friday was the Beach Ball.  There was virtually no line to get in.  The booze was priced right and they have billiard tables.

Beach Ball is just a damn good place to chill with some friends and even make some new ones.<//Review>

<Review>HORRIBLE service. My friend and I were refused service because the bartender (who says he gets Military ID's all the time) didnt recognize her military ID, even after the manager told him we were fine to be served, without even black lighting. Incredibly rude and condescending.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

A very dive-y bar, and the bouncers are incredibly rude. They wouldn’t let in a 27 year old friend because they weren’t familiar with Ilinios licenses. Rude and unnecessary.</Text>

The dealership was clean. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. My salesman, Tim, reserved a car for me to drive and check out. He was knowledgeable and efficient. He did a great job negotiating for me and I was very pleased.
I would definitely recommend this dealership.</text>

Paid cheaper than I was quoted.  Appointments are highly recommended.  Went there,  dropped off vehicle,  they texted me when it we ready and we dropped off 2nd vehicle.  Steve is very efficient.  And Robert is great too.
Steve even noticed that there was a potential problem with my tire (not purchased with them). But let me know it could be an issue.< /text>

This had to be my BEST experience at this dealership. Anthony was interactive, communicative and delivered on everything he said. My car was complete in a timely manner, and EVERYTHING got done that was supposed to be done. My car drives well, and loves the care it received!!!</review>

This is the second car I purchased from AV Chevy in the past two months. The dealership is 85 miles from my house and quite the drive for me to get there, but definitely worth it!!! Everyone there is friendly and easy to deal with, and the prices are amazing!
I have already referred a couple people at my work to check out AV Chevy.< /text>

I can’t say enough about our experience at your dealership. From the moment we stepped on the lot, we were greeted and helped immediately. Every single person we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. I can’t say enough though about David, Tim and Erik. They were amazing every step of the way and truly made us feel welcomed and comfortable in our purchase. They answered all questions and went above and beyond during our time purchasing our new car. We’ll definitely be back in the future.< /review>

<text>Car buying experience was fantastic. Very smooth and effortess. The salesperson Francisco was professional and understood all my needs. My wife loves her car. Francisco putting a bow on the hood was a nice touch. Give this man a raise. I would definitely refer friends and family to AV Chevrolet.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<user_name>Nick Mills</user_name><Pics>None< /Pics><text>A month ago my wife and I went to AV Chevy as they were offering “great trade in”. The dealership gave a good price but didn’t fit in our budget. Made it clear we appreciated it but we wouldn’t never sign for a price that high again. It wasn’t going to happen. Fast forward to today, we had some money for a down so called Nick(sales guy) to talk about payments. He stated, he remembers us saying we would never sign  for that and wouldn’t happen. So what did we want to talk about. I have bought many cars and would of taken a car today(since we had a down payment now) but he wants to be rude. Wouldn’t recommend this place as they don’t respect the customers.</text><Time>1621297910957<//Time>< Rating>

Amazing Experience! Everyone at AV Chevy treated me like family, making my car buying experience easy and comfortable. It’s always very intimidating and nerving  to buy a  car but they were very helpful and found a car that fits my budget and lifestyle. I’ve been to many car dealerships but this is by far the best experience ever! Thank you!<//Review>

They didn’t push the vehicle on us or call/text a million times to see if we could get their business. A few days later we came back and purchased!<//review>< gmapID>

AV Chevy was absolutely a pleasant buying experience. Salesman was great and saw it all thru like a pro; even making sure we knew how to work all the fancy bells and whistles after the deal was done. Customer service can quickly get lost these days, but not at AV Chevy. I highly recommend them!</text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Should separate the sales and service for reviews. Sales team was great and really made the process easy. They would get 5 stars! But service, always takes a long time. I have always made appointments but nothing has ever been quicker than 4 hours. That goes for even the normal oil change and tire rotation. 4 hours! I can buy a car easily in that amount of time. Luckily I'm moving away, but service needs to work on time management and appointments. Why schedule an appointment if you won't work on it for hours?< /Review><Rating>3< /Rating><username>Matt Be<//username>< Resp>

Joseph showed me and my girls a few family SUV’s we let him know that we were looking to trade in our Ford Mustang for a more suitable car as we were expecting a new family member to join our family. He showed us the trailblazer and the features the car included. He even let us test drive it and the family fell in love with it. Carlos was able to quote us a reasonable payment for the vehicle and we really appreciate doing business with them. I recommend them thumbs up! 👏</Review>

I can't begin to explain how upset I am. I scheduled an appointment to get my keys programed to my vehicle. After waiting over two hours the young lady that assisted me told me that the technician was unable to program any of my keys and they would not have time to do it. On my drive home I noticed that when I pressed on the brakes my head lights went dim and also when I turned on my blinkers. I called AV Chevy dealer immediately to speak with a service rep or supervisor. After being told that no one in the service department was there I left a detailed message about what was going on with my vehicle. I was told that I would be receiving a call back in the morning. After not receiving, I called and asked to speak to a manager or supervisor only to be directed to a service rep. At this time I explained what was going on with my vehicle just to hear that they didn't do anything to cause the issues. After asking to speak to a supervisor or manager once again, I was told I would get a call back. I waited until after 4 pm. and still no call back. So I took the liberty to call back only to get directed back to the same rep. At this time I was told all the supervisors and managers have been busy all day but I can bring my vehicle in so the can inspect it. I continued to point out the fact that my vehicle had no problems prior to me bringing it in to get my keys programed. Several months prior my vehicle had a piece replaced that was still under warranty with the dealership. AV Chevy dealer was completely aware because they performed the diagnostic that informed me of the issue at that time and suggested to take it back to the dealership where I purchased my vehicle and get it replaced. Well, now my vehicle is back at AV Chevy to inspect what is going on with the headlights dimming. After being told that there were issues trying to program my keys there is nothing they can do because there was an after market part installed on my vehicle. First of all, aftermarket parts or not my headlights were not having an issue before they tried to program my keys. Second of all, to tell me that they do not work on aftermarket parts after you have already damaged something can't fix the problem. Third of all, to not fix or take responsibility for the problem they created is a disgrace to your business name. Antelope Valley Chevrolet I am so disappointed I guess I will be bringing my business elsewhere.</review>

<Review>The customer service was horrible! We took our truck in because our navigation screen went out and we had to make all contact. After a week of our vehicle being in their shop, we had only received an estimate by text. My husband had to call to get an update and that is when we were told that the cost was 3x the estimate and the person had made notes regarding the updates but was out of the office. The vehicle needed to be fixed but after another week of no contact we had to call again for an update and were told they were waiting for parts.  Again we were notified that the vehicle was ready by text but were given the incorrect amount for repairs and then another update by text apologizing for the error. I  believe someone should have reached out to go over the difference and not by text or least asked how we would like to be contacted. As you can imagine, my husband was not happy when he was told about the cost after having to chase someone down for information and I believe that is the reason for the updates by text. Unfortunately we will not taking our vehicle back and either will our friends.< /Review><rating>1</rating>< resp>

Since relocating to AV, Hunter Dodge has been our family's go to place for auto repair. We no longer have to make that long drive down to Cerritos for vehicle maintenance. Manny Ceja has been our family's advisor for over three years now. He and the work team at Hunter Dodge are very professional and demonstrates patience when addressing our needs over the phone and in person. Certainly appreciate also the regular text updates on car status while in service. Thanks!<//Text>

Came in for recall service which I understood to take 3-4 hrs. Offered Uber to get to work.. Uber never arrived and service took almost 7 hours after check in. I had to call twice to get update. Had to request shuttle 1 he prior in order to get back before they close. Thank you to whomever rinsed off the exterior of my truck, but honestly in think I expected a bit better customer service from such a well known AV dealership. Next time I be sure to get service completed on a weekend when I’m not in a rush.< /text>

I took my car in for its oil change and tire rotation. Someone called me about an appraisal for my car. He said that it would be complementary and I would be charged nothing. When I went to pick up my car it was not washed nor did anyone say anything about the appraisal being done. This is the third time that I’ve taken it in and it has not been washed. I called and asked if they still wash the cars when they do a service and they told me yes unless the machine was broken. I also asked for a callback regarding the appraisal and still three days later I still do not have a car back from the dealership service department. I will most likely be going to another dealership.< /text>

<text>The work done was excellent and timely.  The employees were professional.  The website when booking my appointment was the problem.  If my 60,000 check up is going to cost 1,000 as compared to $350 for my 30,000 check up I would appreciate a heads up when I book the appointment.  I did not have the money because my budget could not go over $500 and I believe your website could do better to inform the customer of the potential costs for routine services.  I was not able to do the scheduled service because I was not prepared financially.  I just got an oil change.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Was extremely happy with service..  and my service advisor. Only thing I thought was Overboard was Owner of dealership  has his photo (cartoon) plastered all over dealership. Doors, waiting room seats with pillows of him I feel is really really OVERBOARD !!   Gives customers the feeling that owner has an image issue with him self. It’s very unprofessional and creepy. When owner should Ask the customers directly about their feelings and dealership him take personal charge that would be more appropriate.  Because I saw Leona four times do you mean nine hours of weed you’re not once to the owner even bother to look at the people in the waiting room or say hi or anything I may not return to this dealership because of this little things count the most< /Text>

< review>
Communication between service writers technicians and customer is very poor. No reason my car should have been held for as long as is it did. Drop it off on a Wednesday and didn’t even get it till Saturday with no work done. Yes after the parts came in the issue was fixed, I understand that can take time, but the customer needs to be fully aware of what’s going on. If there’s no part there you give the car back. Shouldnt have to ask them to put car back together.  Techs said they found no issue with control arm links being loose yet. I have written proof from another Chevy dealer and one other shop saying there was an issue. Upon taking the car back to one of the same shops they found they issue again. Are they not even looking? Also the tatted animated man cardboard cutout logo plastered everywhere is a terrible terrible look and makes the place look ghetto< /review>

<review>I was able to secure the vehicle I wanted however my excellent credit score did not give me any credits, I paid $5000 more than the MSRP, my credit score was hit three times without my knowledge in attempt to get me a better interest rate that did not get any better than the original offer, and the staff were unprofessional and not customer oriented. I have not had this buying experience in the past and would not purchase a vehicle from this dealership if the vehicle of choice was  available elsewhere.  I am not looking forward to returning to get the steps installed.</review></record></dataset><record>

<UserId.>112329812864876270973<//UserId.><review>I brought a new 2019 Corvette Stingray in 2020. I found out my Tow Hook Spring was missing. You need this device if your car needs a tow, otherwise you damage your expensive car. I contacted Steven Deleon service agent 1-18-2021 to make him aware. He told me he would contact me when the part came in, he never did. I made several calls and I get the run around. Its now April 3,2021, He won’t give me an expected time of delivery. I have ordered items online, they always give you an expected time of delivery.
I’m so disappointed with Antelope Valley Cherolet. I wish I never brought a car from this American Company. I want to be made whole.  Save yourself some grief, buy a Lexus.</review>< Gmap_id>

< review>
This has been one of the worst dealership experiences we’ve ever had. We will never do business here again, nor will we recommend anyone to this dealership. After purchasing a 2020 used vehicle all the salesman could boast about was a 172 point inspection and how the car is like new. So we drove it off of the lot and observed a chip in the windshield, as well as the rear air controls to be so sticky you can’t push the button in. They lied on the inspection report and said everything was great. Until the window guy showed up and said he had serviced that chip prior to it being sold. Caught them in a lie on that report. Then the salesman has the nerve to say they use a third party to conduct the multi point inspection. All we asked is you take responsibility for selling a car with some flaws and ask that you fix them without making it a hassle for the customer.< /review>

Usually this facility has provided us with great service but this last experience was not a good one. I know that they are busy but it took them 4 days to look at our vehicle and to let us know what was wrong with it. Then when they did let us know what was wrong with it they didn't take responsibility that it was in issue that they caused when my car was in the shop just a few days before it had to get towed right back. I was just completely rubbed the wrong way that they didn't have one once of care that this inconvenienced us in a major way.<//Review>

<Text>My answers on this survey are solely based on my experience with the purchase of my new vehicle on March 19th and not the interface I needed to do with the service department on March 23rd. My experience on March 23rd with the service department-phone calls prior to that and going to your dealer ship was poor. I believe your parts and service department can use a little more work on the customer service spectrum.< /Text>< response>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>If I could give zero stars I would. Non-stop lying from their sales and managers and when you catch them in a lie all they could do is give you a blank stare. Never honor their deals they promote and always trying to mark up their prices. Neither sales rep can tell you what their policies are because they all have different answers. Worst absolutely worst dealer in my experience. Oh and don't give them any info because they will run your credit report without consent eventhough you told them not too and they tell you right in your face they won't run it. Lawsuit coming.

Alex and Carlos did a great job. They were upfront and straightforward. I believe that they worked hard to find every available incentive to get the best deal possible. I have continued to check prices for my vehicle, and I am still unable to find anything close to the deal that I received from AVC. It was certainly worth the drive from Ventura.< /review>

Very helpful staff. Daniel Toro was very communicative and met us where we were at to get a deal done on the car we were interested in. Even after the deal was complete, he took the time to walk us through all of the features before we left. Much appreciated!<//Review>

This dealership has to have the worst customer service as well as management ever. I guess when they take your money that is all I was good for because how I was treated afterwards was terrible. What a headache.....The vehicle was missing parts and sensors were off but apparently I had to drive it off the lot for it to be fixed at a later time and not then. So when I came back a week later I called and they explained they were ready for me and when I got there they still did not have all the parts ordered even after they told me they did..... Will never EVER EVER buy a car from here EVER again. I could go more in depth on my experience but Ill save you guys the long post and just say do yourself a favor. Go some where else.</Review>

Customer Service is great. However, the service department is ridiculously slow even with an appointment.

I came in for an oil, transmission fluid/filter, and brake fluid change. At most this work should have taken two hours. (And that’s being generous)

AV Chevy’s service department took over five hours.
This is outrageous.<//Review>

<text>Antelope Valley Chevy took great care of my family, we drove 108 miles because they had the certified suburban we were looking for. Our salesman Daniel treated us right and helped us get a great price and a quality trade in. Richard in finance dealt with our 3 little ones running around like a champ while getting us approved for 1% better than our credit union!

Great experience. That can be hard to find when shopping for cars, but let me tell you, Aga is amazing.  She literally spent an ENTIRE day working with me. She picked up the slack when someone else seemingly left me hanging. She spent most of the day helping me while I wasn't even there in person and it didn't phase her one bit. She did as much as she could until I arrived and had several vehicles ready to show me. She has the best personality and was not pushy in the least bit. Another amazing person there is Jason, the finance manager. He made me feel at ease and completely comfortable in the process. I have zero complaints. Thank you again to Aga and Jason with AV Chevy. I promise I will be back! Highly recommend 😊</review>

<Review>Had a early 7 AM appointment for my truck's recall, service rep was professional and knowledgeable, gave me an estimated time of 3 hours, told me he would call when it was ready, he then called a lyft ride to take me home, it took a total about 20 minutes. Then after being home about two hours he called me that it was ready and called a lyft ride again to bring me back. Everything from start to finish was excellent. Thank you again AV Chevy.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

My husband and I got off of work last week and drove over to Antelope Valley Chevrolet and we bought a vehicle and the staff was amazing. We didn’t leave there until ten o’clock in the evening and they closed at 8. ,the staff was so nice and made us feel very comfortable and didn’t care how long it took to take care of us. Normally I don’t write or post any sort of reviews but I felt inclined to do this one. These folks were so kind and worked so hard for us and I just wanted to give them a shout out.  So if you are looking for a car, give these folks a visit. Thank you and god bless....< /Text>

No problem, I made the appointment and also mentioned my check engine light was on since I was bringing it in anyway.  Since I felt ripped off on my last visit getting charged $600 for a software update I wanted nothing to do with another software update.  Amazing, $600 for a software update!!!  What can go wrong this time??? I am just getting a recall fixed.  Even though, all I wanted to know was why my check engine light was on, apparently when I entered my signature on their iPad they can now charge me $310 for another "software update" that I NEVER asked for nor wanted.

<review>AV Chevy is awesome! My salesman, Gregory Grimes, was the kindest young man ever. He did not pressure me at all, and sure new the cars on the lot. He spoiled me and showed my 16-year-old son a grand time! From the salesman to the sales manager all the way to finance, my experience was top notch. I will be back and will not hesitate to give recommendations!

< Review>
I DO recommend coming to Antelope Valley Chevrolet, I’ve purchased two vehicles here and I bring my cars in for routine maintenance all the time. The staff are great! Monica Miranda is a great friendly helpful salesperson and Nina Garcia is an AMAZING manager. When you’re here they treat you like family. However, I Do NOT recommend dealing with one bad apple. The service advisor Anthony. He’s a skinny young looking dude who looks12 and too young/immature to work in such a professional setting just to start off. He started out “okay” when I brought my vehicle in for service because the check engine light was on. Once I mentioned I purchased the extended warranty and wanted to see if my vehicle was covered, his tone changed and he seemed unwilling to help me. He was basically brushing me off and even questioned if I WAS SURE I bought the warranty from them.... and was trying to discourage me by saying most likely it won’t be covered and I’ll have to pay the diagnostic fee and the repair cost IF the warranty company rejects the claim which most likely they will.... a FEW DAYS went by of me calling to find out and he would tell me he was STILL waiting for the warranty company to give an answer.... finally he called one evening and said the diagnostic results showed my car needed BOTH catalytic converters replaced (est. $1,700) which was the cause for the check engine light to come on and WAS NOT COVERED under warranty, however the other repairs (totaling $2,000 approx.) WERE covered under warranty so I said okay just repair what’s covered.  he had the nerve to tell me, despite the only work that I authorized to be done on my vehicle WAS COVERED under warranty, that I would STILL have to pay the diagnostic fee (approx. $150/$200) because the initial reason I came in was for the check engine light being on, which  was caused by catalytic converters and since the catalytic converters were not covered I would have to pay, I had to fight this guy. I told him but the only work being done IS covered so why would I still have to pay that fee? So after a little back and forth he finally gave in and said he would “check with his service DEPT supervisor” and get back to me. I called him the next day and he was  “unavailable” so I called again the following day (Wednesday) he said he was STILL waiting for the parts to be delivered and it would be finished by that Friday. I called that Friday midday on my lunch break and he was unavailable. I called after work and I was put on hold for a little while and finally Anthony answered. He said My car was not ready and would be done Saturday instead. I asked if he got an answer about the diagnostic fee, he was “still waiting” for an answer, he “hadn’t seen his supervisor yet”, but “most likely” I won’t have to pay it after all. I called Saturday and he wasn’t in the office that day, and no one had a status update on my vehicle. They took my name and number and said they’d call me back with an answer. I never got a call. I called that Monday and for the next few weeks he was either “out to lunch” or “not in for the day” and couldn’t get an answer regarding my vehicle. This cycle repeated itself and “his partner” Veronica would always say let me get your number and we will call you back with an answer. I would never get a call back and when I would have to call back again she wouldn’t have an answer still, and this guy Anthony suddenly was impossible to get ahold of. He was obviously avoiding me at this point. I’m a very patient man, sometimes too patient for my own good to allow this guy to go on so long mistreating me. Finally, when I called and they started to tell me the same thing “let me find out and I’ll have someone call you back with an answer...” I involved the Manager. She shut down that run-around game he was playing with me IMMEDIATELY. She told me “I will get to the bottom of this for you” and she assured me I would NOT have to pay the diagnostic fee. This was in the evening, the VERY NEXT MORNING, I got a call “good morning, your car is ready for pick up.” after a FULL MONTH.<//Review>

When you look them up on Google or call another dealer. There even surprise that they charge arm & leg for parts. That's not right. From $858 that they wanted to charge me. I went somewhere else for $340.

My salesman was Erik, he showed me a few trucks, explained the options that came with all the vehicles had good knowledge, I settled on the 1st one he showed me and the finance department was fast and efficient, after financing Erik went over the options again, helped setup myChevrolet app and my iPhone and I was on my way. Overall it was a great experience.</text>

< Review>
Schedule an appointment on line  to have my SUV fix there and when I got there the next morning I was told after the young lady inspected my vehicle that they don’t work on cars that’s old as my SUV (2003)and it has too many miles(180,000). They waisted my time because when I scheduled my appointment the system should have flagged those two issues. I felt like they just didn’t want my business but it’s fine because I took my truck to another Chevy service center and they took care of the issue with no hesitation and great customer service. I will not recommend or think about giving this dealer my business again.<//Review>

Such a bizarre and offensive experience. They took a week for a diagnostic and another week to change a simple egr valve/coolant and a software update from a recall. Stating that’s very normal .When I replied that other dealerships take no longer than 2 days for a diagnostic, the technician replied that I’ll be very welcome to take my car to them..., they refuse to pay for rental at all. Either they supposed to stop taking more customers or...I might had a discriminating experience.< /Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>I've taken my car here twice. The first time they kept my car for a recall for a week and a half. Very minimal updates on what the hold up was to find out they were waiting on a part. I was going on a family trip that weekend so I asked if I could just pick my car up and bring it back after the part arrived..  magically they had the part and had my car ready for pick up the next morning. This second time I took it for a floor shifter issue. We dropped it off on a Thursday, I didn't receive any updates until Monday morning... I wasn't able to pick my car up until the following week.... so again, they had my car for over a week and a half, almost 2 weeks this last time! They never offer a loaner car or even let you know that they're going to take weeks with your simple issue. I will be trekking it down to Santa Clarita for future issues, they never kept my car that long when I had an issue and they kept me updated along the way.<//review>< user_name>

<Text>I recently purchased a Chevy Volt and could not have been any happier doing so, I was helped by Carlos Castellon who was more than helpful and made the entire process simple and pleasant. I would highly recommend anyone considering looking for a new or used vehicle to go to Antelope Valley Chevrolet and ask for Carlos, they had the biggest selection of vehicles I was shopping for and beat every advertised price I could find with a better selection as well.</Text>< Pics>

<text>Tim Drake was our salesman, we have bought several cars/suvs/trucks from Avchevy but by far this last experience buying our new Silverado was the best. Our previous experiences were 5 Star also but Tim went above and beyond from the first time we met to discuss our wants to the day we were ready to buy. Tim made us truly feel like he was there to help and guide us and his customer service was on point. It was because of our first meeting with Tim we came back to purchase our Silverado. Always a good experience with AVChevy but stellar with Tim.<//text>< userid>

<Review>I have the say. I went to a lot of dealers, not one helped or even approached. And the second I stood on chevys lot, the sales agent Nick came up right away an was extremely helpful, on point with selections and literally had me sold on a truck in min! Maybe the rain made it speed up a bit. Lol  Awesome guy, an was very cool to make the deal an sale with! Was a great experience from start to finish. Extremely happy so far with my purchase and the services from Antelope Valley Chevrolet have been fantastic! Advisor Victoria was very prompt, professional and helped fix any solutions I had in the service department.
I’m very picky and Can’t complain! 5 stars all the way< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I can only assume that the actual job to my vehicle was done right and I don’t think I have anything negative to say about the mechanics however, my husband and I both had to deal with the sales department who kept insisting that the work we needed on our vehicle was not covered by warranty. It took several calls to corporate to confirm that indeed the work we were requesting was covered but they kept trying to have us pay for something and I’m not sure how often they get away with that with other customers. They never called to update us or let us know the car was ready. We had to follow up almost every day. And each time we called, we were told they were understaffed or that our representative was off for the day so they always took a message and it always required a second phone call to follow up on our end. Got our car back, and all the codes are cleared and it works great but I am most likely going to get my service done elsewhere from this point forward.<//text>

I’m a first time buyer and AV Chevy made my experience quite memorable. I was helped by Monica. Her and the financial department (David i think) were very transparent throughout the entire process, they actually made an effort to secure a low interest rate, and overall I drove off satisfied with not only my new car but with the service AV Chevy provided.</Review>

< Review>
The showroom where we conducted our transaction was clean and the atmosphere was friendly. The financial representative, Jason, was knowledgeable, friendly and a pleasure to interact with. Our salesman, Gregory Grimes, was outstanding. He patiently worked with us while we continued to change our minds on models and options and then when it became obvious that the model and options we wanted was going to be hard to locate he diligently searched for weeks to locate several options for us to choose from. Any time I sent Greg an email or message he promptly responded, even one time when I accidentally sent him a message when he was on vacation. After a few of the choices we made were unavailable (some at the last minute) Greg made an all day trip that ended well into the night to pick up the vehicle we had chosen (after the dealership almost sold it out from under him) to make sure it was made available to us on the day we had planned to drive from out of town to pick it up so we did not have to change our plans at the last minute. I am most definitely going to recommend any of my friends and family that are looking to purchase a vehicle to go to AV Chevrolet and talk with Greg.</Review>

I walked in later in the afternoon and Alfredo gave me the warmest of welcomings, helped me find exactly what I was looking for! I really enjoyed my experience, Alfredo was very understanding with what I wanted and made sure I was 100% happy with my purchase! He was super attentive, wasn’t pushy (just trying to make a sale) and even called back after purchasing just to make sure there was nothing more he could do for us. One of the best experiences I’ve had! I would highly be Recommending to all family and friends when purchasing a vehicle!< /Review>

<user>108480898216715691490<//user>< Review>
My wife leased a vehicle late November 2020.  We turned in her other leased vehicle at the same time which was ending mid December.  We will never do business with this dealership.  First issue is they didn't have the spare key and we needed to take the car in for several hours to program the spare.
Second issue and this is the deal breaker for future business.  I have been notified by the dmv of an outstanding registration that was originally due in December.  We no longer have any affiliation with the vehicle since it was surrendered in November.  I go to the dealership with the dmv outstanding balance paperwork.  The sales manager goes and speaks with someone.  I wait.  I end up waiting at least 20 minutes.  So I go into his office and ask what is going on and that I don't have all day.  He said it has been 5 minutes and he is working on it.  A couple of minutes later he comes out and says I need to GM financial because all they do is contact GM and the car is taken away.  I have turned in several leased vehicles at different dealerships then the original lease.  I have never had to do a thing with that vehicle and had never received information from the dmv about any association with the turned in vehicle.
In summary they don't know what they are doing.  Do business with them at your own risk.  If we get another Chevy it will be in Valencia or Burbank.</Review>

I am not sure if there was someone before us signing paperwork. Regardless, Richard who we signed paperwork with was awesome and Anthony our salesman was great.

< Review>
Worst experience ever here. It took 4 hours plus just to get an oil change and my lights changed/diagnose. When I came in I knew what the problem was and I told Lilly. My appointment was at 9:30am checked in at 9:40am. My car did not reach a tech until 11:37 when I went to check on it. Mind you I told them I would be waiting. You would think they were jam packed. They was not! I did not receive my truck back until 1:48pm to be told they don’t have the part. SMH 🤦🏾‍♀️ not once did anyone come check on me or give me a progress report. Not even on the link they send you. I missed work and paid a diagnostic fee for what I knew I need and didn’t even get my truck fixed.<//Review>

I filled out a request to talk to a saleperson about a lease special last night. I was called this morning at 9:35 and was told that the lease special was for only 1 vehicle in stock and that vehicle was gone. I then told the salesperson that I would like them to see if they could find me another vehicle close to that one and get me a price, knowing that it would be more expensive than the special. I told her I was ok with that. I also said I was interested in purchasing a bit more expensive model of the same vehicle but I wasnt sure about the color. The person told me they would get back to me with the lease payment and send me pictures of the vehicle. At 2:00pm I hadn't received pictures or a call so I called the dealship and talked to another person. I told the person the situation and that my wife and I were coming from over 2 1/2 hours away and wanted to come to the dealership to either lease the vehicle or buy the more expensive one. I also said that I wanted to have the transaction finalized this afternoon so all we had to do was drive down there, sign the contract, and drive the vehicle home. The person told me that he would expedite my request and send me pictures as I had requested earlier and get me the lease payment. It is now 7:00pm and I still have not received any pictures, nor has anyone from this dealership bothered to call me back. I guess because I was not purchasing a $70,000 vehicle, I was not worth their time or consideration. I would never consider buying a vehicle from this dealership ever again. How difficult is it to figure out a lease payment? It shouldn't take 9 1/2 hours. Pathetic< /Review></record>

But at the end the customer service with Austin was fantastic and I was able to walk out with the vehicle right off the show room floor. Fantastic experience, me being a single mother knowing that I had received that support  to help me leave with a Reliable vehicle.Thank you very much Austin you were fantastic and pay attention and heard me out on my needs, Austin answered all my questions and went through all the details for me to make a comfortable decision at the end.

He was finally able to resolve the problem. If not for him I would be looking for no stars.

I bought a 2020 CAMARO Convertible just 4 weeks ago. A week after I bought it the top stopped working. I took in to service and was told 2-3 days as they needed to order parts. 3 days later I call for status as we have not heard a word.  The Service assistant will call me back.  Day 4- the service person will call me back. 2nd call- the service person will call me back. A THIRD CALL and the service person will call me in the morning. Day 5 NO WORD BACK AGAIN. I All and ask for a manager and all are to busy to pick up the phone and AMAZINGLY- the dealership “doesn’t have the number to Corporate Chevy”. That’s ok. The internet is a wonderful thing. On day 6- I have texted- called x2 and still cannot get anyone to tell me what’s going on with this brand new car I bought and has been in the shop longer than in my possession.

I finally got in touch with Jay only to find out the part was not even ordered. He finally got the part ordered and 3 says later the car is finally fixed.

HORRIBLE Customer service- and now I have a total distrust for anything that comes out of their mouths. Will NEVER return to this dealership for service and they just lost us as sales customers as well.<//Text>< gmap_id>

I was impressed with how professional my sales rep. Was.  There was no game playing with pricing witch I've experienced at other car dealerships. What I was quoted  is what ended up in my contract.  I enjoyed buying a Chevrolet.<//Review>

<user_id>114081056289294510937< /user_id><Text>I was so pleased the repair was covered 100%. That was a nice surprise when I came to pick it up.

I would have liked better communication from the service rep. I was told the Tahoe would be done Monday. By late afternoon (3pm) I still had not heard anything. I texted the number I was given, to get an update with no response. The next day I got a text at 715am apologizing, as she was out sick, and that the tahoe was not yet done, they had to run one last test, and then I could pick it up. Again, by late afternoon (430pm) I had not heard anything and had to contact the service rep for an update. At 5pm she responded the vehicle was finally done and ready for pick up.

I think you guys need some sort of system where a supervisor or back up person checks the texts/voicemails/phone calls of the service reps who are out sick, so the customer is not left hanging with no response.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
From beginning to end of the purchasing experience PLUS service, AV Chevrolet has been amazing.  I can't say enough!  I purchased a car during the COVID pandemic and am immunocompromised.  I know, I shouldn't have been out car shopping, but I needed a safe vehicle to get me to doctor's appointments.  After I test drove and chose a vehicle, I went back to my car, and the salesteam took care of the rest.  I didn't have to get out of my car at all!  They spoiled me rotten!  The absolute best car-buying experience I have ever had, and I have bought many cars throughout my life.< /Review>

Terrible experience. Took this dealership two weeks to change my oil and replace a shock. Communication isn’t something that they value. I will never give this business another dime of my money.
Business ownership reached out on Yelp saying that they will be contacting me to ensure that I am fully satisfied, and I haven’t heard a peep. What a joke.< /text>

I went in to the dealership to get my first new car in years I walked into a packed dealership and monica was right there ready to help I have pretty challenged credit and monica's attitude was simply I'll get you a new car with an easy payment with little to nothing down and most car salesman say the same thing but monica was legit I live right across the street and she dident hold me hostage at the dealership like every other car dealership she literally said sure go home I'll give you a call and she did there was no pressure she called and said I got you approved with a cheaper down payment and monthly with a low apr so I come back to the dealership to drive the car alone with no pressure she just let me take the car than I drive the car back drop it off and told her let's do the paperwork she told me there was a long line for people to go into finance and I could go home and she would call me when the car was ready to be signed she called me a couple hours later I came in signed the paperwork in minutes the gentleman that I signed the paperwork was awesome super nice very easy to talk to and explained everything with ease this is the car buying experience that other dealerships should offer there was absolutely no pressure from the mangers from monica there was no closer that came and sat down to drill me it was just so easy monica's communication is the reason she sells cars she literally still responds to my texts weeks after buying the car she's never left me hanging I plan on paying of this new car soon and going right back to buy another car from monica at the same dealership because I was treated with humanity and patience thanks again antelope valley chevy<//Text>

Francisco was likeable, friendly, professional, and straightforward throughout the entire process.  I was a Costco program referral and he called me back immediately to ask about my needs in a vehicle, promptly sent me multiple options in a new Silverado via email, set my appointment, called me multiple times to keep contact and make sure I was set, and was properly attentive without ever being pushy.  I highly recommend Francisco to anyone looking to buy a new vehicle and the dealership was safe, easy to traverse, and fun to work with.  I love my new truck and the entire experience was painless and efficient.  Thank you Francisco!!!<//Review>

What is there to say about AV Chevy other than what a wonderful group of sales, service and accounts people! Truly A-Star service in every way. These guys sold me an amazing car (2019 Mustang GT Convertible) at one of the best prices I've seen and took care of me throughout the entire process, including some issues I had after purchase.

The car had an issue with the window alignment on both sides and, despite being overdue on its warrantee, the gang at AV Chevy got it fixed for me, paid for the work, gave me a loaner car and didn't even charge me when I forgot to bring it back gassed up (I REALLY FORGOT)!

My sales rep, Aga, has been so lovely and is always professional. She never seems frustrated even when she's done her job and sold the vehicle. She always got back to me in a timely manner and updated me like she promised she would.

My service rep, Luis, was super helpful and accommodating and got things done quickly for me. He also reached out when the car was good to go and gave me an update.

The manager was awesome throughout all of this. The finance rep was fantastic and the people on the front desk are super friendly and professional. These guys don't mess around on service!

I will return to AV Chevy if I ever fall out of love with my GT and want a new car. I highly recommend these guys if you want a group of people who won't let you leave until you're satisfied.< /text>

We explained our experience we had at a different dealership, and told her that we were looking online and stumbled across a couple cars, and we just wanted to browse around. It started out as texting, then we decided to just go there. She was so welcoming. She explained everything we had to ask with honesty, and with details. After a long day at the dealership, we ended up buying a brand new car, and thanks to Aga again for it. Best experience ever. If you want to by a car, ask for Aga.

< review>
I scheduled an Oil Change through the myChevrolet ap for 13 Feb at 11:00am. I pull up and a woman comes out to ask if I have been helped. I said no, I just pulled in and I have an appointment. She asks me to go inside and it appears that there is only one woman working in the service department and there are three of us waiting. I wait my turn and she asks me why I am there. I share that I have an appointment at 1100, she says I don't. I assure her that I do and provide the email. She tells me she cant find it still, moving on. I ask for an oil change and that I would be dropping it off. I give my number and I leave. 2 hours later, I receive a text that my car is ready and we head to pick it up. This time there are three people working, the same two women that helped me initially and another gentleman at another desk nearest the garage. The older woman greats me, "Hello Mr. Wayman, we will be right with you." There are two gentlemen ahead of me so I wait. Ten mins after I arrived, a young woman comes in to pick up her vehicle and she is taken immediately to the gentleman at the other desk while I am still waiting. 10 mins after that, another person arrives and the older woman again takes them to the other gentleman. I understand the service department was short handed, however, there is NO reason that two people who arrive well after I did or the other gentleman ahead of me to be serviced before us. Thats just bad customer service. When I do have my turn, the young woman tells me that I need to have my air filter changed and the cabin filter changed. (I'm fairly certain they were changed within the last 6 months and its recommended that they are changed every 30K miles which it has NOT been). Each time I go to Antelope Valley, I get the same high priced unnecessary work recommended and poor customer service treatment. Were it not for the inexpensive oil changes and free tire rotation, I would most certainly take my vehicle elsewhere.</review>

I waited more than 3 hours, and it wasn’t until I went to the front desk to ask if my car was ready that they went to check. When I received the vehicle, it was with grease fingerprints all over the car. I took photos of that, just in case you would like to train your service people on what not to do.

<text>I appreciate the service here, I’ve been to other car dealership where the experience was not great at all. My sister went here to purchase her first car, they were fast to come and help us. James our salesman was great, he made sure that my sister made a choice that she was happy with and would feel safe in. They did everything they possibly could to get my sister out with her car and I greatly appreciate it. I would definitely recommend anyone looking to buy a car to come and look here first. I guarantee you won’t be disappointed let alone the prices for the cars are great with low miles if looking to buy a used car. We were looking at cars at hunter dodge and firstly no one came to help us as we walked around the lot for 20 minutes seeking help instead the salesmen were huddled in a group talking to one another. I had a completely different experience here at AV Chevrolet and I am grateful appreciative for all their support and help.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<user_id>110426090410613370454< /user_id><review>Worst Ever Customer Service... 1st it started off with an 1 hr 15 min wait time to see a service writer. A 0830 hrs appt and didn't get out of there until 0945 hrs. I took our car in for most likely an alignment and check for an acceleration hesitation. After waiting all day, I called the service dept at 1630 hrs and they told me the service writer was with a customer and they would have him call me back. Recieved the call at 1715 hrs. He told me they couldn't service the car since it was over 100k miles (125k the car has) and no service history with AV Chevy. So, the cars sat all day, nothing. I had until 1800 hrs to pick up the car. So, I got the wife and we drove from Rosamond to Lancaster quickly to get the car. I talked to the service director and he told me they have the right to service the car or not. I told him that's every business right. I told him we took the car to Rally for service. So, now he's willing to work on the car. No way, they didn't even ask from the beginning what or where the vehicle has been serviced from the get go. You would believe those questions would be asked up front since they didn't have a history.  I'm sure their computers showed that prior to the appt. In fact I was going to have our other Chevy worked on and mentioned they had record of the newer car, not the older car. So, after sitting an hour and 15 min in line, when I checked in the car, maybe some rules of the game should've been mentioned.  You think! Now I will driver 1 hr 20 min to have my vehicles worked on at the dealer I bought it from. Not worth the time with AV Chevy since they aren't forth coming from the beginning.  I did ask, if a person just moved here from out of state, they would refuse to work on their car because of no service history? The answer, it depends. I guess they should of asked me more questions to apply to it depends. Shady at best....... Responding to the owners response. Who do I reach out too? Or should you be calling me?<//review>< pics>

Everyone there was very friendly and professional. My sales person was Ashley she was very helpful. I told her I needed a 7 to 8 seater car I have a big family and I told her how much I can afford. I’ve been looking for a car for a couple of months with all disappointments and I thought this was gonna be another one. I was wrong. We now have the Chevy Traverse!!!

<Text>If I could give no stars I would the service department  is the worst. I will never bring my car back here ever again, I rather drive to Valencia to Auto nation Chevy. I made a appointment for 8:30am with the service department have my tire sensor reset on my 2021 Camaro, when I came on that day I waited a hour and a half before I was even seen. Once I got seen I was told was it couldn’t be reset and that I needed new sensors. I said ok that’s fine maybe I got a bad batch of sensors. I was told that it would take some time to perform this task , so I was advised to make another appointment for another day and I did that. So it comes the day I drop the car off I was told it would take a few hours. Let me say this, I understand what needs to be done to change the tire sensor. It’s not something that’s done in one hour. I drop the car off at 9am at 12pm I get a text message that the car is being worked on. At 2pm I go up there for an update because I’m still in Lancaster running errands. I wanted to check before I headed back to Palmdale I didn’t want to get to Palmdale and they call and say the car is ready. They say we are still working on the car I said ok and left. I waited 3pm comes and go, 4 comes and go I know they close at 6pm, 5pm come. I get a text at 5:15pm saying they don’t have all of my tire sensors to finish the job. So they had my car since 9am and waited til 5:15p to tell me they didn’t have the sensors mind you I made a appointment for this job and week after I had a already came and they couldn’t reset them. There Communication is beyond terrible, at 12pm they said they were working on the car at 2pm they were still working on the car. So how do you not know for 7 hours you didn’t have the sensors. Why wait 7 hours, that because my car sat there all day and wasn’t worked on til 5pm. So they lied in the text message and when I went up there at 2pm. So I had to leave my car overnight and try and figure out a ride situation for work the next day. So I let them keep it overnight (I had no other real choice). I asked to speak with a manager, I was told they would call me still waiting on that call. Then for the icing on the cake I get a text message the next day at 9:30am saying they were able to reset my sensor using a different scanner and I could come pick up my car. I hate being lied to I’m a really understanding person if your up front with me, tell me how it is not what you think I want to hear.< /Text><response>{'time': 1613061122054, 'text': 'We appreciate the opportunity to learn about your recent experience in our service department.

<review>We found online the truck we were looking at the right price to fit our budget. I made the call and were told the truck already sold but was informed of a similar truck in transit. First person I spoke to was Yolly she was very cordial and helpful. She connected me with Erik Pacheco who from the very beginning was responsive to questions about availability and pricing and very knowledgeable about the 2500 Silverado. What I liked most about dealing with Erik is he stayed FOCUSED on the truck WE WANTED instead of steering us to another model. He delivered no less than what we expected and more on the in-person client service when we picked up the truck. He took his time showing my husband all the features and functions of the truck; he helped set-up our devices to connect and sync.
We appreciated his professionalism and excellent custom service.
We also dealt with David in Finance dept., he was prepared for us, paperwork ready to be signed and explained the terms and conditions and got us out of there as quickly as possible.
Our experience was very good and positive; the ONLY negative was the WAIT time for the financing process.</review><username>Rowena Thamm<//username><user_id>109558703672126906416<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80c25afbe425eae5:0xf85f5bd071e6c797</Gmap_id>< Pictures>

Great experience no pressure no stress a little anxiety come on man you’re making a big purchase.Stany was the best car salesperson I’ve ever worked with didn’t try to push me into things I couldn’t afford or really didn’t need And the guy in financing can’t remember his name was just as great as Stany really worked with me 👍😉</text>

0 stars if possible. Husband and I drove several hours to this dealership (hunting for the best deal) and upon arrival the vehicle was not as described. We were also lied to, as they were trying to cover up a positive covid case they had with their employees, so my original sales person was out and I heard mutliple excuses as to where she was, she also promised us a first responder discount, and that apparently was another lie. Against our better judgement, We decided to purchase the vehicle and it took about 2 hours to just see the financing supervisor, and this was after they ran our credit after being asked not to until we could agree on a price. I showed a printed credit report  so we could verify that we had the credit we claimed. Fast forward to when my husband took the vehicle back in to receive repairs to the vehicle as wrote up in our contract..  first they weren't not going to repair every thing until the contract was shown, and then he was quoted a 1.5 hr to 2 hr wait time. He was there for 8 hours. There were no chairs to sit in, which I assume is because of covid, but asking customers to sit on the ground doesn't exactly seem like a cleaner alternative. Overall bad experience, will never return. Will never recommend.< /Text>

The only reason I am not rating this 1 star is because of Liliana I am very thankful for her. I had an appointment at 9:15 am to program a key to my car and ended up not leaving until 4 hours later. I was first helped by Robert who after 2 hours and me asking the status on my car tells me it wasn’t even looked at but that it will be done in an hour. I waited another hour and Robert was no where to be found and asked liliana she had a problem locating my car due to Robert putting the wrong model of car and wrong tag number on my paperwork so no one could find my car. And that took another 30 minutes to locate. Once found they stated they needed 20 more minutes Liliana understood I was in a rush and helped me sign paperwork and go to the cashier before my car was done so all I needed to do is wait on the keys and go. On top of this I was asked multiple time if it was my first time at this location and I stated yes. Yet when I was told to wait I was not told there was a waiting area I waited outside in the heat for a whole hour and no one stated anything the only reason I found out there was a waiting area is because I entered a different part of the building to look for a restroom and stumbled upon it. I will definitely not be coming back for future services not even the oil change I need next month I’d rather do it myself. Thank you very much Liliana but Chevy other than her this location sucked with customer service. 4 hours for a job that takes no longer than one hour.

**UPDATE:I contacted Roberto and gave CHEVY AV another chance this time I was cared for by Anthony and was cared for very well and checked on by Roberto himself he really does care for his department and guaranteed me better service, than the first time I went, from now on.< /review>

<review>I brought my car in for service on something that is under warranty. I first took it to another auto shop just for diagnoses. When it was confirmed what was wrong and which part I then took it to Antelope valley Chevrolet to be fixed as it was just replaced back in January 2020 so it was till under warranty. Tjere were 4 parts to this one item. In January 2020 we replaced 3. Per the mechanic at AV Chevrolet the one with the issue is the one that we did not replace. Per the 1st mechanic I took it to that is wrong. The one causing issue is the original one and reason why I brought it into the dealership (not AV Chevrolet) back in January 2020. Av Chevrolet wanted me to pay another $1200+ for this issue when it was under warranty. I refused and still had to pay $155 diagnostic fee which in my opinion I feel they didnt check it just went off paperwork in the computer system from the time I brought it in back in January 2020. This is not my 1st horrible service I've had here. Back in January 2020 I brought it in for something else and the service writer said they wont fix another mechanics mistake. They wouldn't even look at it. Horrible service, horrible employees. I'll never be back nor will I ever refer ANYONE there.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1606240045680, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feedback with us, Stacy.

Courtesy person had standing in line for the advisor to finish with the person in front of me. While waiting patiently to speak to an advisor, another courtesy person brings another customer and walks them iside the booth to be next. Being respectful of the current situation of social distancing is why i chose to wait outside. Was not happy and left. I had already waited 20 before the other person was put in front of me. The courtesy person should have at least asked me if i was next and if i would mind if this person could go before me.</Text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>For the most part purchasing my used car was a pleasant experience. I was talked into purchasing a road package I didn’t necessarily want but maybe I might need it? Great car though and thankful they were able to deliver it 200 miles to my home. However, they did not honor my AAA purchase deal which was to include a free 5 day/500 mile right of return and 50% off dealer installed accessories. The agent blew it off by saying that there was nowhere on the paperwork to add that in. An air bag light also appeared on the dashboard a few days after purchase. I took it in to be looked at by my local mechanic and was told that the dealership probably just had the light turned off in order to sell it instead of fixing the issue. It is a nice suv and I do love the extra room it provides for my family. If my local dealership had a comparable car to purchase I would have definitely went with them because they wouldn’t have tried to talk me into adding any unnecessary parts or packages to the deal.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The greeters needs to acknowledge all customers regardless if the customer is standing and waiting at their advisors door.
That morning the greeter with red hair NEVER acknowledges me EACH AND EVERY time I go in for service.
I suggest she gets more training along with people skill because she is terrible at her people skill.  I've mentioned this before in my other surveys...is my feedback being ignored? It feels like it.<//Review>

< review>
Horrible. I waited in my car for about 15 mins and not one employee that passed me took the initiative to get me some help. Next, I waited 3 hours for an oil change....? Also, the lady that helped me, checked off on her slip that they we're gonna check the recalls on my car, do the oil change and give my car a car wash. After hours 3 we concluded that NO ONE checked my car for the recalls (2) and no one gave my car a car wash. I was extremely disappointed with the service, I expected so much better, a good experience at the very least.< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Took my vehicle in for an oil change. As it was due for one. I prefer Rally GMC, but given that I have three free oil changes that are owed to me from Antelope Valley Chevrolet, so I have to take it there for two more left. Before going I knew I had two recalls. I was only planning on doing the oil change, but since I was already there I asked if they did the recalls, at what time would my vehicle be done, and my Service Advisor Anthony stated that my vehicle would be done by 2:00PM. He did not even ask if I needed a ride home, which I called a friend. I waited until 2:30PM and then called the dealership. They said they would give him a message, called again at 3:00PM, and same issue. Finally he calls me back close to 4:00PM, and says they are backed up and that he would check with the technician and call me back. It was getting close to 5:00PM, they close at 6:00PM, I live 20-30 minutes away in Palmdale, CA, and this is high traffic time. So, I called my friend and asked him to take me to the dealership. Anthony (my service advisor) then calls me at 5:00PM, and then states the vehicle should be ready by the end of the day, still failed to ask how I would be picking up my vehicle, never offered the shuttle, he could careless about customer service. Regardless of setbacks they should call customers and inform them of such setback, customers have lives, and other matters to attend to. Such lack of consideration for others, and this industry, well this dealership lacks such consideration, seems it is quality versus quality, and such blunt disregard to their customers and such poor customer service. Also, the last phone call I made prior to getting a call back the service person who is taking the calls at that desk was rude, and again did not seem to care about any concern of mine. I hate leaving bad reviews, I worked in the industry years ago, and I know surveys are the Service Advisors report card per say. But, given the lack of care, communication, and poor customer service this is as nicely that I can write this survey, as my time was taken, and I was infuriated. I will only go to this location if I have to, but if not I choose Rally GMC. Many share the same opinion. Hope management actually read these surveys, and pay attention to the issues occurring.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Took my 2020 traverse for service for the 3rd time for the same problem and with an additional problem. It took over four weeks to fix it. Service writer wouldn’t answer my calls and would keep lying about different things like they couldn’t cover a rental, and pretending to call Hertz to after the call saying: they don’t have anything available when she didn’t even call.
I’m very disappointed of my new car and the customer service from AV Chevrolet to the point that if Was given the opportunity I will return my car.  Thank you for the opportunity to express my frustration and disappointment.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1609261368523, 'text': 'Roberto, we want to learn more regarding your recent visit as your experience does not reflect our values.

Through I wasn’t happy that my check engine light came on again only days after I took it to them, Robert made it right and even though I was very upset he was very calm and professional. More car dealerships need a Robert working for them. Had Robert not been there I would have traded my car in for a different make and model and been done with Chevy. Thank you again Robert!

<user>101433356908783262791</user><Text>I had an appointment for 11:00, but was not advised that the oil change would take 2+ hours because of the number of people ahead of me.  The wait time would have been nice to know.  Anthony Latanzio was my service advisor.  He scheduled a LYFT ride to take me home, and the driver cancelled the service when he tried to pick me up in the back employee lot and couldn't find me.  I was in front where I was told the ride would pick me up.  I watched the service status app on my phone, but it never changed.  When I called to check the status of the service I was told the car was done.  So much for the status app.  When I picked up the car, Anthony was on a personal phone call and took 5 minutes to greet me.  As I paid the cashier Anthony told me my car had 79,000 miles and at 75,000 miles should have had cooling fluid changed and several other items attended to.  That information should have been provided to me when he was writing up the service order.  Normally the service advisor goes over any recalls, and service items when I first arrive.  Learning about these items as I was paying means I have to schedule another trip to the service department, and another 2+ hour wait.  This isn't a good way to keep steady customers coming back and generating business for the service department.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Went to Antelope Valley Chevrolet after a surprise check engine light on my Equinox while working in the area. After almost 6 days, I was told my engine was beyond the average repair. I was quoted 11.5k for a full disassembly, repair, and reassembly. The standard GM response to a bad engine in that vehicle is a full replacement which averages 6-7k. It was upon hearing the quote that I knew AV Chevrolet is one of those dealerships that attempt to rip off the less knowledgeable customer coming in for repairs. This is the kind of dealership you you need to check receipts for 30+ dollar charges for the replacement of shop items in your repair bill. I cannot be more vehement in my absolute disgust with AV Chevrolet.< /Text></record>

<text>We were disappointed with the sales representative. He did not want to take off the KARR alarm system the dealership installed. We think they install it to make it easier for them to open the cars and not have to get the keys. Anyway, the alarm charge was $800.00 which is "cleverly" hidden in their advertisement. When we asked to please take it off, he refused. So we asked if at the very least the dealership could obsorb 1/2 of that cost, he refused to do it. No doubt he wanted a higher commission because the next day, we called and spoke with another sales rep. We did not tell him what had occured the day prior and he was willing to pay for half of the KARR ALARM SYSTEM and then even willing to remove the cost. Anyway, that day we bought a beautiful Equinox from another dealership.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
The sales department at Antelope Valley Chevrolet is phenomenal. I have been coming to this dealership for over 10 years and never have I had a bad experience.

Within the last few months I have purchased two vehicles from Anthony & Nina. I highly recommend this duo. I was never pressured and the prices were hassle free and extremely competitive.

Do yourself a huge favor and buy at AV Chevy.<//Review>

This was the worst experience that I have ever had with a car dealership very unprofessional pulled my credit multiple times without times without my permission which is against the law. Approved me for a vehicle let me drive it off the lot then asked for me to return it because if an employment verification they stated because my employer use a cellphone and not a landline phone they couldn’t verify my employment. They said all employers have landline phones which is untrue I know plenty of business owners who do not have a landline phone.  When I provided them a land line phone number to another manager. My manager informed me that she received a phone call from GM Financial. Jorge, Jason and Justin said that Gm financial didn’t speak to my employer which was a lie. I was discriminated against by this dealership and I would not recommend this place to anyone. I was treated horribly and given false information and I had to return the vehicle because of an employment verification although I am employed very unprofessional dealership.< /text>

<Review>My visit to AV Chevrolet was very positive. Aga the Sales Representative who worked with me in purchasing a new 2021 Traverse was very friendly and nice. I did not sense any pressure from her for a sale nor was I rushed through the process (test drive to out the door pricing). She seemed very knowledgeable about the car and was very direct (i.e. no haggle). I would recommend this dealership because of my experience with Aga.<//Review>< rating>

<time>1598815729313< /time><rating>1</rating><Review>NEVER! NEVER AGAIN!!! I called here on Tuesday morning to see if they had time to work on my pickup. They said they did and if I brought it in that afternoon they could get back to me with the diagnosis and cost by Wednesday afternoon.  I brought the pickup in around 3pm Tuesday and left it.  Wednesday I got no call from them.  Thursday I called in the morning with no return call.  Thursday afternoon I called again with no return call.  Friday morning I called.  No return call.  Friday afternoon the person answering the phone recognized me and kept me on the phone till someone took my call.  Robert took my call and told me he would know what was wrong with it soon and call me back.  I explained to him how important it was that the pickup was repaired because I needed it Sunday.  He of course apologized and gave excuses but promised it would be repaired in time.  Late Friday Robert did call me back with the diagnosis and cost.  I again told him I absolutely needed the pickup back for Sunday.  He again promised me that wasn’t a problem and I would have it back.  Repaired. By 4pm Saturday.  Saturday at 3pm I went to the dealership looking for my pickup.  After 30 minutes they came and told me the parts just came in and no way could they fix it in time.  I told them to bring me my pickup and I was done playing games with them.  Another hour and a half waiting around and they finally gave my pickup back.  Of course Saturday my advisor Robert was not working.  This place and its staff do nothing but run you around and tell lie after lie.  I do not recommend this dealership to anyone.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1599003419561, 'text': 'Hello Alex, we have seen this review and are concerned with the experience you described.

Being in the business for many years I have a much higher standard than most when it comes to buying my cars. I was impressed with this dealership. From my first encounter with Yolanda in BDC TO Renz who was a great sales associate, and finally finance which was fast and efficient. My only drawback was the 5 hour round trip commute from Palm Springs but, I would do it again. I can tell how well things are run from ownership, general management to sales and support staff. This is a first class run dealership. I would highly recommend this dealership to the public</Text>

This should be illegal, pretty sure the FTC called that bait and switch back in the day and made these guys post vin numbers to avoid it.  Looks like they found a way to do it again.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>30 minutes into my 75 minute drive was called and told that the car would cost me an extra $700 for a non-removable Karr alarm after being told the out the door price in writing and that there were no extra fees.

I told them I was no longer interested and ended the call. They called back two minutes later saying they would drop the Karr alarm to $200 and raise my trade in from $4,000 to $4,500 but there would be zero negotiations on the price of my trade in or the car I wanted to purchase. The car I was interested in has some scratches on it and they said that I wouldn't get any extra off the price even with them.

I hate car buying and it doesn't help when one of the best reviewed sellers in the area do stuff like this.< /Review>< user_id>

<text>Horrible service. Absolutely horrible.

My car went into AV Chevy's service department the first week of October and is still there as we I write this (9+ weeks later).

Since the day my car was dropped off I have received TERRIBLE customer service. I have not ONCE received an update without having to call AND text 2, 3, 4 + times, sometimes even multiple days apart (trying to be understanding of busy schedules I'd try to give them time to respond). Even one of the managers continued to not return my calls.

Besides being TERRIBLE at communicating, they also are extremely unhelpful in other areas. My new (bought used) car is there due to needing a new transmission (thankfully I bought the extended warranty) and due to no fault of my own. Warranty only covered 5 days of a rental and knowing this within the first week of my car being there I immediately looked for assistance from multiple employees at chevy. I tried everything to get assistance because I genuinely needed it and was told they could do NOTHING for me everywhere I looked. Fast forward a couple weeks and I exhausted every option of borrowing cars and rides before I HAD to rent a car, and it wasn't until I got ahold of a manager and explained my dissatisfaction with everything that they FINALLY offered to help with half of the rental (which I was originally told was impossible due to their policies). Well 26 days later of being in a rental, I could no longer afford my half. I called once again pleading for help, and they again had continued to REFUSE to help with more than half of my rental fees; even though I in depth explained how I could not afford even half. So, regardless of badly needing a vehicle, I was forced to return the rental. (According to them they would of continued to cover half of the cost, for any length of time, regardless of the price "as long as I was covering the other half". So you'll pay $2000 if needed, as long as I match the $2000, but you can't just cover the $1000? Does this make ANY sense? No, not to me either.)

Well due to me having to return my rental I've been late to work, have had to leave early, had to call out and miss out on 3 whole work days and caused a lot of issues at my place(s) of work (beings that I myself am a manager and am scheduled to work 6 days a week). So this WHOLE situation has caused me a load of stress and A LOT of money. Even explaining everything, still there was "nothing they could do".

Well, now 9 weeks later my new transmission was installed and programmed, but couldn't be released because now it had another broken part. Oh, and I got this update after 3 days of calling to see what was going on with my car and getting no straight answer (again, not once receiving an update without looking for one). I again was told my car needed to stay longer, this time for a separate repair and was told  again there was nothing they could do about a rental. I then got in contact with Steve, the head manager, and was told he was "just brought into this case" (9 weeks later after me asking to speak to a manager multiple times?). Well after a LOOONNNGG conversation and some begging and pleading he got me into a rental from them free of charge until my car is finished.

I am thankful of the help I received after 9 weeks of hell, but what about the maxed out credit card I have that should have NEVER been my concern? What about the missed days at work (hundreds of dollars)? What about hearing that "there was nothing they could do for me rental wise because they don't have loaner cars and policies state they can't do anything" yet now that THEY'RE responsible for my car needing repairs NOW rules change?

UPDATE: Still have not heard from a manager in regards to my experience regardless of their comment on the post. Ontop of that, when I finally did get my car back the gas tank was almost on E (even though I dropped it off at a 1/4) and my experience continued to be unpleasant. Terrible, terrible service. I'll be reaching out to the head of Chevy to dispute all of this.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< user>

< Review>
My and my husband's purchase experience was very messy and disorganized. We came pre-qualified and with a trade-in vehicle, fully prepared with more paperwork than was even needed. Our sales experience began with the salesman not having much knowledge of the vehicle we planned to purchase (we had to Google certain vehicle specifications and certain features were incorrectly explained, which we found out later). Next, we were offered a trade-in value below KBB and financing options that were significantly different than what we came pre-approved for. In addition, we were informed that our trade-in vehicle was leaking what was possibly coolant and our check engine light was on. When we expressed concern over this (because our last vehicle service was flushing/replacing coolant barely two months prior at AV Chevy and we had no issues prior to our arrival), our salesman seemed to lose his friendly demeanor and dismissed our concerns. However, we went ahead as planned and focused on the purchase of a new vehicle. We were upfront with our salesman that we wanted to finance with the company that pre-approved us and we did not want any other hard inquiries to our credit from them attempting financing with other companies. After some time negotiating, he informed us that the finance department recommended applying with another lender for a significantly lower rate, so we agreed to one additional hard inquiry. Our salesman came back with the numbers, which were agreeable to us, so we accepted the terms and proceeded to wait for the financing department to be ready with our paperwork. After the better part of another hour, financing was finally ready with the paperwork. As we were completing the paperwork, the finance representative explained our lender would be the company with whom we came pre-qualified. We explained that this was incorrect, as our salesman had us agree to an additional application with another lender that offered us a lower rate and monthly payment. The finance representative then went through all of the application information again, only to inform us that our original lender was the correct one and the lender from the second inquiry would result in a higher interest rate and payment. When the process was finally finished, my husband had to ask no less than four times to have a bow placed on the vehicle for pictures. Our salesman even went so far as to solicit a good review by telling us that his pay would be affected for the next six months if he received less than perfect remarks. We did not appreciate the guilt trip. We spent five long hours at AV Chevy haggling over prices, checking the dealerships details, and waiting for each next step of the process to be completed, only to be left with THREE hard inquiries on our credit for the next two years (we have no idea why they ran our credit a third time), more miscommunications than we could count, and no intention of using AV Chevy again. Ultimately, we are only giving one star for the fact that we love our new vehicle and have already received numerous compliments on it. We will be heading to the next nearest Chevy dealership for standard maintenance and only going to AV Chevy out of sheer necessity if we cannot get our vehicle anywhere else.</Review>

They gave me the run around that they couldn't get any info because the person that is working with my car was busy. I got a call back just for them to say I had my car there all day and no one looked at it. The next day about mid day I called back and when I called back they told me I couldn't get info on my car because the person that was working with  my car wasn't there so they couldn't give me any update at all  I was confused and mad that is my only car and I needed to get to work everyday well they did that for a few days until about a week later I got my car back but it was not a good experience at all I will never return here again I have never felt like I was a problem checking in on my car when it was getting serviced<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>Anthony Morales did an excellent job helping me purchase my new Trax.  I had not bought a new car in over ten years so I was a little rusty with the process but he made it go very smoothly.  He went over the main features of the car and answered all my questions.  In addition, he showed me around the dealership and explained how I could be bring my car in for service.  Overall a very good experience with him.<//Review>< Pics>

I really have a pleasant time at AVChevy. So much that I decided to purchase a car. The salesman, Adam who helped me was really awesome. Greeted me as soon as he saw me walking outside and ask if I needed help. I did, and he ended up helping me in my purchased. I really appreciated him for going the extra mile in the time I spent at the dealer. Everyone was so courteous and nice. Even the finance dept, Jason was very thorough and knowledgeable. Overall, I would recommend AV Chevy for anyone looking to buy a Chevy. Their price are so low and competitive that I drove 45miles even though there is a Chevy dealer 5mins from where I lived. Thank you AVChevy!< /review>

First off thank you to management and to all of the staff for all your hard work and staying in the fight with COVID-19.
Each time myself or my wife come into AV Chevy it is a wonderful experience when it comes to servicing our Silverado or the Malibu.
Always a professional atmosphere from start to finish while service is being done and waiting in lobby.
The service takes time, but it’s always quality and I have done what is best for us. I make an early appointment and drop off my vehicle and then await for the wonderful follow up that I receive from Steven and or Victoria.
Great dealership and they do a sparkling clean job on the complimentary car wash!
Hint hint— Ask for a VIP wash!

I brought my Traverse in for its normal due service (oil change) and from check in to pick up went fairly smooth. When I checked in my vehicle they asked if I would like it washed so I said yes. When I went to pick up, it never happened (kinda disappointed). Then that evening when I drove my vehicle and went to park it, It’s now telling me to put it in park when it’s already in park. I don’t know what they did during my oil change but I have never had that issue before. I called service to get the vehicle in, they said I would get a call back before the end of the day and it never happened. I am very dissatisfied with my most recent interaction with AV Chevy.<//Text>

First of all, the people at the dealership are exceptionally nice and very attentive. Greg, my salesman, knew the vehicle  from a technical standpoint  and that is saying a lot considering just how complicated a new vehicle is.
I was a little disappointed that I didn’t get an interest rate below 3 % even with a high credit score and putting down half the cost of the vehicle. Guess they don’t deal with new vehicles.< /review>

The service department here is literally the worst. I dropped off my car yesterday morning and it took over 30 minutes for me to check in. My service advisor Liliana was on the phone with a client (understandable) but when she got off the phone didn't even interact with me or ask me to hold on a while longer, she just started shuffling papers and making more calls. When I finally got checked in i was told it would be $310 for a diagnostic fee for my vehicle. In what world does it cost $310 to look at a car?! I agreed because it was a check engine light and I'm hoping it's still covered under the powertrain warranty.

When I received my preliminary receipt it stated there was a $155 "tell us more" fee and a $155 actual diagnostic fee. So I'm being charged to wait to hear about my car? The receipt also said I would hear back by the end of the day. This morning I send a message using their messaging service and haven't heard back. I decided to call and I HAVE to wait for an assigned service advisor to give me a call. 🙄🙄 These people have no concern about your needs they've had my car for over 24 hours and I have no update and no vehicle. They don't give any effs about what you have to do but they'll make sure they take your first born as payment.

This isn't the first time I've had this issue with the service department here. The customer service, communication, and timeless have consistently been subpar. At least they have that; consistency. I've brought in my car before for an oil change and air filter replacement and ended up waiting 4 hours in their waiting room. When I complained they told me my car hadn't even been touched. Scheduling an appointment here does you no good and only God knows how this place sets their priorities.

Update: I did try talking to a manager on Wednesday 11/18 and have yet to hear back from you. Don't try and make it look like you care because you have my information and you haven't returned my correspondence. I finally got a response from a service advisor 11/18 (after calling several times) and was told me vehicle would be ready by Tuesday 11/24, which is ok, I just want to be communicated with. I received a text message yesterday 11/19 around 5 pm that my vehicle was ready. I checked the my chevrolet app and the error is still coming up so I called in today 11/20 to verify that information because I have two pieces of information contradicting that. If my vehicle is not ready THATS OK I wasn't expecting one until Tuesday 11/24 like I was told by a different service advisor. All I ask for is clear communication so that I can figure out what to do since you won't provide me with a rental now that you've had my car since 11/17.

This was the only way I have been able to communicate with a manager and it's abysmal. I have left a voicemail on 11/18 for one of your managers. Quite frankly I'm disappointed that your service advisors don't take adequate enough notes for other advisors to keep customers updated. I don't understand why I have to talk to my service advisor specifically for ANY and ALL information. Proper notes protect your business from negative reviews and experiences (like this) as well as litigation. I look forward to your response.< /Text>

I purchased now as of October 12 , 2020 two cars from this dealership. The first visit wasn’t a good one compared to my recent exchange with Larry . Great salesman very friendly , very relatable, and respected very much on my end . He made the process exciting and I’m not easily excited so that should say something ! Larry M. Is a patient and excellent Chevrolet employee . If I could give 6 stars I would .<//Review>

Service department wouldn’t respond to calls, took 3 tries and a call to the department head to get a price breakdown. An oil change and a window regulator took the entire work day, and I had to demand it not be kept overnight. Window regulator was $80 more than a quote at a different Chevrolet dealer. I had to pay for the oil drain plug that was rounded off by “wear and tear”, probably from a technician who did not use the right size socket or used an impact gun to remove it. On top of the fee for the bolt, I was charged my for the labor to install it. Didn’t matter that they removed it for the oil change I had already paid for. When I inspected the window regulator, the technician failed to properly seat the window in the weather stripping so it jumped track. I had to track down the shop foreman who corrected the mistake for me.</Text>

<Text>As a former salesman Chevy once again remind me of why I left the business. I went in there with a pre approved loan and they basically never bother to do anything and help me get into the camaro I wanted . I left upset disappointed I walked over to Toyota where in 1 hour I walked out with a new car priced at the same price as the camaro . Thank u av Chevy and finance manager for remaining me of why I left the business. People be very careful here the dishonesty lack of knowledge was by far horrible.< /Text><user_id>105583306173922837905<//user_id><date>1604805419528<//date>< Pics>

<text>It was my first time getting serviced for anything. My CPO was still under the warranty and all costs were covered. Although they were not able to find anything wrong with it after multiple tests, they said I can come back if I find that my coolant goes low rapidly again. However, I liked the service. The lady who checked me in to take pictures of the car was very nice and welcoming. She talked me through the process and took me to the service advisor Anthony. He was very informative about what would be done with my car and if it’d stay overnight. I’ve seen reviews that the advisors don’t respond promptly, but they should understand they have about 12 cars (more or less) in the shop in one day. They will call you when they have updates about your car< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Reached out through the internet to get information on a vehicle in inventory. Erik P was awesome , he was quick to respond and get me information as  quickly as possible. Unfortunately the first vehicle we looked at had sold, so we looked at the other vehicle which was similar just different color. Again the information was given to us. Just so you know they are not flexible on internet prices so I’m told. I work out of town so my wife drove out and checked out the vehicle and did her share of test drive and inspection she reviewed information with George C who was super helpful and informative ( I really appreciate George who went above and beyond to explain things and just provide honest information from his past experience)  the team was super helpful and not pushy . When I came to pick up the vehicle i was told it was detailed but upon review it definitely had not been just tires shined.  I’m still not positive if there was a breakdown in communication or if they thought I wouldn’t notice. Anyways truck got detailed and tuned up and made a big difference. I live in garden grove so it was a 2 hour commute to get this vehicle and I would do it again for their service</review>< pics>

I CAUGHT ANTELOPE VALLEY FLAT OUT LYING TO ME - DO NOT GO HERE OR BUY ANY VEHICLE PRODUCED BY GM PERIOD - Go across the street and buy a Toyota!

I have a 2016 Colorado Z71 that was taken to Antelope Valley 5-6 times within 6,000 miles for several major issues (stuck in 4wd, clunking suspension, transmission "chuggle", hard start/misfire, blown speaker, bad infotainment module, bad AC compressor, bad drivers window motor/regulator). To be fair, the truck was not purchased in Kansas not at Antelope Valley.

Over the course of these visits Antelope Valley could not reproduce the "chuggle", hard starting, or being stuck in 4wd which I more or less expected. These problems only happen about once a week, but they have still caused the truck to be towed at one point or another. The speaker, window motor, and AC compressor were eventually replaced and I was told the infotainment module and the rear leaf springs/shackles were "backordered" so I waited a week and called back. Still "backordered". The next week: still backordered. the week after that: still backordered. Half of the time I couldn't even get ahold of the service department and had to leave a message with the receptionist - which probably didn't actually make it to the service department.

I called GM directly twice after the 3rd or 4th dealer visit but was not able to get ahold of anyone to find out if the parts were actually backordered or not. Every time I would take my truck in for a new problem it would sit at the dealer for several days before they diagnosed the problem. The extended warranty that was sold to me by Chevrolet went from covering my rental car completely when I dropped the truck off, to only covering 1 day because technically the dealer only used half a day to diagnose the truck and it sat the rest of the time it was at the dealer, to not covering any of the rental at all while my truck was in the shop because on the day Antelope Valley did work on it, they only charged 3 work hours and the rental is only covered if they work on it for at least half a day (4 hours).

At this point I am already extremely frustrated with the truck and the dealer experience as a whole to the point that I am shopping for a Tacoma to trade for my Colorado less than 6 months after purchasing it and reaching out to lawyers to see if I have a Lemon Law case. I called Rally Buick GMC Cadillac to see if they could get the parts (I had the exact part numbers that were "backordered" from Antelope Valley). Sure enough, there are 10, 20, 30 of each part that I needed available at the only local GM parts warehouse. So Antelope Valley was flat out LYING to me about the parts being backordered. I have all receipts from Antelope Valley and planned to get a receipt from Rally after they fixed the truck stating that the parts were in fact available when Antelope Valley said they were not. I have everything together to confront the owner of Antelope Valley, but unfortunately my truck was totaled 5 days before my appointment at Rally to finally get it fixed. Its not worth pursuing since I (thankfully) don't even have the truck, I just hope someone reads this review and decides not to give their business to these jokers. I have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and GM Directly. According to the GM rep this is not the first complaint for this exact problem from this dealer.

Before this truck I drove older (1995-2010) GM products almost exclusively and loved all of them, but I will not be buying ANY vehicle produced by GM for a very long time after the experience I have had over the last 6 months or so. Pay the extra few thousand to buy a Honda or a Toyota; its well worth it to keep your sanity<//Text>

Great service! Nina is amazing and Monica really made our buying experience smooth and comfortable!
David was super helpful and walked us step through step to clearly understand our contract and all of the advantages when buying from Chevy.
Btw- we've had a total of two services done to our Malibu and couldn't be happier!<//Text>

<review>Someone in the service department is a thief...after a three hour wait (for an oil change) i get in my car only to discover my entire glove box has been raided by an employee. It is any wonder I waited three hours, someone was too busy lifting merchandise from customers cars.

Onto the next issue, the technician who worked on my car claimed i had an oil leak...when i asked where it was leaking he stammered then said “it could be from the top but you would need to do a diagnostic to be sure” (i take exceptional care of my car and have never had a leak and still do not have a leak).

Also when i asked if they took care of the recall issues with my car he said he didnt know about it and to bring it back to be looked at another time.

I know dealerships have always tried to scam people, but the thing is Antelope Valley Chevy attempted to steal from my glove box ontop of it!<//review><Time>1594253763688<//Time><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

< review>
After over a month trying to schedule recall work, kept being told they were waiting on parts, I stopped and talked with Roberto Chirinos three days later part was in and work was completed. I was told it wold take approximately 4 to 5 hours for the work, it was completed within this time frame. Anthony Latanzio was assign as my contract. I was very pleased with the service I received. The negative in my numbers reflect the issues I experienced while trying to schedule an appointment, mainly negative call back when asked for approximate timeframe of part arrival.<//review>

<review>(Edit: it's been a week since AV Chevrolet (Nicole) responded to my review. They have not reached out to me to correct the issues they left me with.)

Came in for an oil change, left with a newly broken interior door handle. Manager got involved and told me they cannot fix due to high mileage (140k) and it would cost $807 to fix. I found the parts on Amazon for $30 and fixed it myself.

In addition they told me my engine and in cabin air filters needed to be changed. 2011 Silverados do not have in cabin air filters from the factory. This dealers didn't even check my filters and lied about one of them even existing.

Do not buy or have a vehicle serviced here if you value fair and honest work.< /review>< rate>

<Time>1576369216037<//Time><rating>1< /rating><text>Terrible dealership. I found a really nice car on their Facebook page and decided to go take a look. Customer service was good, but for the part that really matters, I had a terrible experience. To start, they ran my credit so many times, that I was unable to apply for a credit card when I tried a month later. It seems they wanted to sell the car so badly that they didn't care if it was going to hurt my credit. And that's not the worst part. The numbers NEVER added up, even after pointing out  the discrepancies to them. There were quite a few of hidden charges and products also. I gave them a chance to review all charges and asked for a list with every single charge and guess what? The numbers still didn't add up. Their complete lack of transparency and inability to do math were big red flags. Even though the car was beautiful, I could not tolerate their behavior, so I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

So i called for a ride and while waiting decided to browse the inventory which is amazing and the salesman are laid-back and no pressure just the way it should be they offered to show me a few cars but i respectfully declined due to i just had my car in service was not really there to shop just browse. If you are in the market for a new or used car then AV Chevrolet is the place to go they wont pressure you in to buying but will be kind enough to show you any car you like i 100% recommend this location and would recommend it to family and friends. (Reason for 4 stars was because of shuttle service) other than that would have been 5 stars.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1576684226199, 'text': 'Thank you for the great feedback!

Nareck Havluciyan at Antelope Valley Chevrolet got me into the vehicle I wanted and did it within the price range I needed! He worked hard to make things happen!

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I had a pleasure of receiving my Customized  2020 C-8 Corvette August 28, 2020 here at the AV Chevrolet Dealer in Lancaster CA. This is my Dream come True Car. It couldn’t have happen without the help of Nina G., Dave O. Samuel (salesman) and to include Justin G. The experience in the past 9 moths with GM on strike, then the pandemic March 20, 10 days before my build date (March 30) , they keep me updated on my new build date of July 14.  It was delivered to AV Chevy on Aug 4 by railroad and truck and trailer. We had it sent the car out to “Ghost  Shield “ for a 100% clear wrap and carbon fiber wrapped on All the black on the C-8 , Powdered coated the wheels and tinted the all interiors windows less the rear Engine Hatch.
All preparations were completed and ready for delivery Celebration on August 28, 2020. What a Total Surprise on the VIP Delivery Experience. I was so Overjoyed by this and had tears of Joy. Never in my life has this ever happen, but it did in the Antelope Valley Chevrolet Dealership.
I LOVE YOU ALL (each and every employee at AVC0 from the bottom of my Heart, What A Lovely Product you    Produce & Delivered.

<Text>I received calls and voicemails to come in and get a recalI service done. Decided to get it done when I went in for my routine service. They said they would be able to complete the recall. After 3 hours they completed the oil change and told me that they checked my vehicle and needed to order the parts for the recall and would call me when they came in. Again I recieved calls to come in and get the recall done since the parts were in.  Came in for my appointment to a friendly attendant checking the cars in. Service agent seemed to careless and was cold when he simply placed a paper in the the counter and said it would be   around 4 hours to complete my recall. After 2 hours of waiting  he calls me and tells me they need to order more parts and I would have to come back in 3-4 days. No concern for my time, no sorry about that, no it was our mistake in not ordering the correct parts or checking the vehicle correctly to see what we needed, just simply we will call you when u need to come back. I do not live in lancaster but this is the closest chevy dealer to me and now I have to return again for the third time to try and get this recall fixed. Guess if you're paying for service they are a little more courteous than if they are doing something for free even if it is their own vehicle recall.< /Text><Rate>2</Rate><name>CEO</name><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<Text>Absolutely would not!!! recommend this dealership..had to use on star because  my service  track light came on my new camaro ..was towed ther on a staterday..they would not give me a rent a car ..because  the car was under warranty .and had to verify  it was a warranty  problem..so after waiting till Thursday. They tell me they will not  honor the  vehicle  warranty ..they tell me it was a broken bottom knuckle  and control arm ..estimate over $1,200 in replacement  and repairs ..i could not afford  that so had the car  towed back home ..after inspection  it ...i t was only and $9.00 bolt that broke and had to be repaired...this dealership  has no regard  to customer  service  and only want to to over charge  ustomers  and rip them off. By throwing parts at vehicle  to fix them , dishonest  mechanics. Horrible  stealership ..never will purchase  a vehicle  from them or have work done by them...i hope they get shut down asap!! Definitely  does not help build trust  in repairs   or future  purchases..first time I had to do a corporate  complaint  on any company.<//Text><Time>1597272231644<//Time></record></dataset><record>

It doesn't matter how long it takes to fix your vehicle they won't give you a loaner or at least discounted rental car ....I took my Chevy Cruze  to them to fix that I thought was a recall since I received a letter from Chevy  about a Chevy Cruze recall  they kept my car for 2 days for diagnostic and diagnostic resulted it wasn't that and I ended up paying $155 . So I spent those times and money for nothing.</Text>

This was a terrible experience.  They washed my car as part of the service and the rubber seal around the luggage take was pealed off. When I notified the dealer via text message they did not respond.  Then I called twice and they did not respond.  After the third call they ask to inspect my car and stated the photo they took of my car showed there was a slight tear in the rubber but could not provide me a copy.  After, all that they refused to fix the damage. Nothing but problems with this dealer service center.<//Review>

I called to make an appointment to get my tires replaced. Service department was great good customer service, but when it came to the parts department, man did I want to hang up. Poor customer service, it sounded like they didn’t even want my service and they asked something and stayed quiet for minutes with out saying anything. Poor communication</review>

Stop by here today had some questions about leasing they weren't really sure what my hands are should be so they basically were guessing tried to push me into a vehicle that I wasn't ready to buy to make things more economical I really felt like they weren't listening. When I arrived I went to park in the handicap Zone they had two other vehicles parked there one of them was a brand new one parked on the ramp the other was a used one taking up one of the spaces they were quick to tell me to move out of the way because they were out of spaces when I was walking through the lot when I mentioned the fact the vehicles were parked legally they turned and walked away really wish a cop would go there and write them a couple of thousand dollars worth of tickets I won't be going back I'll drive down south if I have to to get my next new vehicle<//Text>

<user>103973933420501652763</user><Time>1578611493520<//Time><review>DO NOT BUY OR GET SERVICE DONE HERE!!!
I brought in my truck because it kept dying and first off the service advisor was not able to tell me if JUST the diagnostic would be covered by the warranty or not. I have never run into this type of situation. Diagnostics are usually covered under warranty. Just so they can tell me what’s wrong with it. Service advisor Anthony told me they had to run the diagnostic in order to see if the warranty covered the diagnostic, which makes. O sense to me. Secondly, after 2 days of not knowing what’s wrong with the truck I asked the service advisor to keep me updated even if there were no results. 5 days in I was irritated because I was without a car the whole time. And they couldn’t give me a rental or courtesy car because they still didn’t know what was wrong but they didn’t care if I was left without a car. They called me on the sixth day in the evening to tell me it was finished and that it was something simple. On the seventh day I show up to pick it up and when I turn on the truck the check engine light is still ON!!!! Horrible customer service! They don’t care about you here! DONT GO!!< /review><gmap_id>0x80c25afbe425eae5:0xf85f5bd071e6c797<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Called on a used vehicle, and was told to come in and that it was available for test drive by Francisco.
Took the long trip to the dealer.  Greeted by Francisco after a wait.  He told me the vehicle was out to a different dealer for a recall repair and it would be back soon.   Never happened after a 2 Hr. Wait.  So the went through the costs.  What an insult to my intelligence. Had all kind of bogus charges added. Finally left for dinner with wife.  Francisco called and said car was back..  Told him,  Not interested after that insulting visit...   Very sloppy run dealership. I Do not recommend.....< /review>

BEWARE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT
Try to schedule a Simple oil change and they refuse to give me a estimate just ballpark time it may take even after they say they are not busy. i ask to talk to the manager and once i ask this every time of the receptionist its like they try to cover for themselves and everyone else . everyone is either busy or at lunch. give them my number and never a return call

this isnt the first time , every time i try to deal with this shop the service is terrible.  i guess ill call dodge next door to get my service on my brand new chevy 2020 equinox ...SAD

Update 6/26/20
The managers are setting up fake service appointment messages in a attempt to talk to me , this is dishonest and un-professional. sad i had to go to dodge..whats next ?</review>

<review>Terrible customer service!! They would call me every single day for a month so i can go look at a truck so i finally put an application on a truck and i never got a call back from them, not even an update. I would call them to ask and they wouldnt direct me with anyone they were always “busy” or “not there”. I DO NOT recommend this dealership.<//review>< pictures>

Wasted our time. We called ahead asking about a car, when we got there from driving over an hour and a half, they told us they sold the car earlier today. So then we looked at another car, that was comparable, but they would not work the price at all. Very disappointed and a huge waste of time.

Edit: They called me the next day, saying the purchase of the car fell through, and that the car is still available. Jessica (customer rep) and Greg (sales associate) were very helpful and were able to get everything settled.

Edit #2: Alex (sales manager) was also very helpful and helped make this a positive experience.</Text>

Went in for maintenance check in my car and it took up to 3-4 hours to release my vehicle on an oil change. Bad communication amongst the team, the person that did my oil change completed his wk and left for the day and didn't release my car.

Signed up for Costco program since I am purchasing soon but it didn't mention I would be called until after signing up (unless it was in "fine print") and received a call from a ride "girl" who demanded I give her a call back time which works better but before I could explain I am currently in Canada on a business trip, she hung up the phone mid sentence, it was obviously a hang up since you could hear the noise of the phone crashing down and not "disconnected", I'll have to try another dealership since this one child is not a true representative of my families truck brand of vehicles...<//text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>If you have to have service to your car .... Do Not go to AV Chevrolet.  Worst experience of my life.  Run the other way.  My Rep lied about reporting damaged to my tire to me when I drop the car off.   She said she reported it to me and never did.  I told her the tired is under Warranty and no reason to lie.  But why would you lie about a $75.00 tire.  if I was AV Chevrolet i would be very embarrassed about a employee who represents them not telling the truth.  It makes there company look like crooks.  I have reported this to GM and contacted my attorney.   IT is NOT ABOUT THE MONEY,  BUT THE TRUTH and if i did my research and read some of the bad reviews on here i would have gone to GM rally in palmdale.  I just found my work order and the rep did not report any damage to the car at all.   Funny how she says she mark down the damage to the tire.  but marks down nothing to indicate damage.
Response from the owner
Reagan, our dealership goal is to provide exceptional service to every single customer. It appears you did not receive this experience with us. I would like the opportunity to speak with you to work on resolving this issue. We will be reaching out to you to ensure you are completely satisfied. Well that will never happen when  your GM never returns calls and does anything he promises.  The Service Manger Nicole calls me up offer me 10 percent discount and a new tire.  I did get the 10 percent discount but did not get a new tire.  what I got  was a used tire that leaks.  So if you are the owner the best thing you can do to save your business is to fire  your GM.   'With all the bad comments about AV Chev  people are starting to stay clear of AV Chev and I do not blame them.</review>< userid>

<text>Terrible customer service.  Wasted 6 hours of my time sitting around waiting for an answer.  This dealership doesnt want to sell vehicles.  Hours go by with no response.  Finance people dont contact you.  Try and support local business but based on their behavior from a returning customer we will go elsewhere to a place that's actually trying to sell vehicles.< /text><userid>110247673272414794079< /userid><gmapID>0x80c25afbe425eae5:0xf85f5bd071e6c797<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This posting deserves no Stars!! I Did not Purchase my 2016 Corvette from this dealership because the sales staff was insulting, rude and condescending. After I bought my car from another dealership, my thought was to use the AV dealership to service my car. My vehicle has an excellent extended warranty. I took my car in for a mechanical issue with the drivers seat. My Representative and the Service Manager lied to me said it was not covered under the Certified warranty nor the extended. I asked the service manager to double check? She responded that It was not and the price would be approx. $300. I contacted my warranty and they do and will cover the seat issue. This dealership is deceitful and untrustworthy. GM was contacted and a complaint was filed, the service manger responded with yes we did contact the warranty. Which is a lie as I confirmed that there was not an made. If you are in need to service to your car .... DO NOT go to AV Chevrolet.< /Text>< pics>

A 2017 chevy malibu lt battery is $270. Disregard the battery maintenance service as it does not apply. At the time of service there was a coupon for batteries that did not apply to the battery i needed which had to be the factory one because people bring the car into the dealership a lot due to aftermarket batteries somehow causing other functions to fail. There is also a $75 installation fee which i declined.< /review>

<review>On 8-26-19, I had my 2010 Honda pickup towed to this business because I had purchased it there, and also because I had the used car warranty on it, I had my appointment set up for 8AM, got it in right away, thought the problem was the power steering, they found the problem within 2 hours it was a bad motor mount on the passenger side which has a gel solution in it, they provided me with a rental vehicle for 2 days that was covered by the warranty, the people in the service department and rental department were great people very knowledgeable, personal very busy and friendly and there to help, I highly recommend this business to anyone who needs repairs, by the way they did fix the problem with the right Honda part, and it only cost me 100 dollars for the deductible the warranty paid for the rest.< /review><gmapID>0x80c25afbe425eae5:0xf85f5bd071e6c797</gmapID>< response>

< review>
Bought a 2020 colorado zr2 bison (55k  truck ) from this dealership, spent over 10 hours to get through the buying process. After the fact of walking out a few days later had many, many phones calls for redoing the paperwork that they botched and was trying to talk me in to come back asap, although I live over 1.5 hours away and run my own business. So after close to 10 calls on the paperwork you would think they would respond when as a customer would have a issue. Good luck getting any support in any sort of timely fashion, and or parts ordered. 3 weeks after ordering parts I was told they were in... yeah they weren't! Got to spend a whole day waiting for things that were never ordered. I SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH SUBARU!!!!! Almost a week after the fact, still not a single call from the sales rep to rectify my issues or missing parts. Major bonus they did call my wife phone, and refused to take my number to call me directly. Bottom line nothing short of a bad joke of a dealership, poor customer service after the fact, but hey they all talk real nice to you... till you leave!!!!< /review>

<Review>It was my first time here and i had a service appointment at 11 AM. Was there until 2:20pm.
I assumed there would be nice kids corner like the majority of dealerships have now a days. To my surprise a carpet and some dirty toys in a corner is what I saw. I get its not a place for kids but there are people who need to bring kids along and have no other choice. It would be nice if AV Chevy updated their kids area.<//Review><UserId.>109252834356760272684<//UserId.><time>1554414110748< /time><gmap_id>0x80c25afbe425eae5:0xf85f5bd071e6c797</gmap_id>< Pictures>

Bought a certified car 4 months ago. I  brought it in for an oil change, only to be told during pickup I already used my oil change services and no longer under warranty. After explaining that this was my first time here or even ever getting an oil change since I bought the car, I was then told my car is not certified. I paid $62 for a standard oil  change that would have cost me $25 elsewhere. Not to mention they did not even do a courtesy car wash. 🤦‍♀️😤 No more Chevys for me!!!<//text>

The service is horrible. I took my car in on 11/12/19. For two days my husband and I called to check on the status of the car. No one, including messages left for the manager, returned our calls. Their customer service is non existent. The problem is they know it but they don’t care. We finally got our car back on the third day and were told they could not find the problem. The car is still having the same issue but I refuse to pay $150 to have them tell me we don’t know again. Incompetent people working there.< /Text>

<Text>I live in Burbank CA., and was extremely happy to have found a vehicle that not only fit my budget but also fit my sporty life style.
I thought my next car buying experience was going to be a nightwear due to my past credit history (BK) but I needed a reliable car to get me to and from work so I started the process.
My nephew told me about his car dealership experience and recommended Mike Martinez from Antelope Valley Chevrolet.
I gave Mike a call and told him about a car that I had seen on his dealership’s website and he took it from there.
Mike worked with his finance manager to get me just the right deal to fit my budget and had a lot of encouraging words for me along the way.
Finally I made an appointment to meet up with Mike at the dealership to take a test drive, sign paperwork and drive home in my new Chevrolet Spark, I love it!
Thank you Mike Martinez for giving 110% of you effort and going the extra mile to ensure my happy experience buying a new car.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1556739919674, 'text': "Thank you for your great review, Cindy!

<text>Horrible customer service, save your money go somewhere else. These are the most unprofessional people I've ever come across at any dealer, ever. I was a technician for Chevy, Toyota and Honda for 12 years, and I could not understand why they wanted to charge me $200 to verify that something was leaking on my truck even though the truck was already up in the air. All I asked for was a visual inspection to see if anything was leaking, and if anything was leaking I would have gladly paid the $200 for Diagnostic, but they refused. They also refuse to perform a transmission service on my truck because of the high mileage, even though I told them it would be okay to do so, and I would deal with the ramifications if the transmission were to fail afterwards. Don't go here, don't shop here, don't waste your money on a bunch of hacks.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Terrible service from the maintenance department... they will never call back. I was going to purchase a set of tires for my Silverado... no return call with price. I was going to get my 50,000 mile service... no return call with price after multiple times of calling them. Every time I’ve had my truck service with them I watch the tech remove and install my wheels like it’s nascar. Ultimately resulting in tooling marks in my premium wheels that’s deeper than superficial. Even a simple car wash is done with such poor quality. I peeked around the building and out of no surprise the employee washing my truck literally sprayed it with water and dried most of it leaving behind water spots.

Service Rep.Victoria was very detailed in what maintenance items were due, quick to get my car in serviced and washed for pick up.

I would definitely recommend working with Victoria.

Arrived did the paperwork deal was told car would be ready in an 1 1/2  - 2 hours. At about 11:38 was taken to cashier to pay bill after paying was told they would bring car around front. 1 1/2 hours later I received my car. Reason for time was I wanted was. Believe me it was not an hour and a half car wash.
Finally contacted by Ms. McCracken she told me thanks for bringing it to my attention. That’s it nothing else. This is such an UNSATISFACTORY dealership I will never service or purchase a vehicle from AV Chevrolet. Piss poor service and customer care does not exists at this Chevy Dealer Stay away far away.

< review>
Scam. It happens twice. Internet advertising silverado for 27k. Once in Nov and the second in Jan 2020. Good to be true. Got there and the Truck already sold. I was Told need to be at 8am to get the deal. Looks like adverstisements are to bring people to the dealer and try to sell something else. Sales person different each time, were horrible. I was treated bad. This is my 3rd time buying a car and never had experience this bad behavior and bad service from a dealer. Basically was told it is what it is and if I didnt like it Then so be it. No wonder people buys at the other cities instead of Antelope valley. Sales person told me Truck was sold, but advertisement still showing on the internet. I called and see what they say and was told still available and to make an appointmen.
False advertisement.
Will go to another dealer instead.
Horrible experience. If you don't mind buying whatever they want too sell you, instead choosing what you want then good luck.</review>

We recently purchased a used vehicle from AV Chevrolet.  The sticker price was reasonable, but we were very surprised at the end of the paperwork by an $800 fee for a secondary car alarm that had been added (which we did not want in the first place).  This fee was NOT part of the sticker price, and we were just stuck with it!  I felt that sliding this fee in at the end was a bit underhanded.  Also, we were promised a callback for a small fender repair on the vehicle within a couple of days.  That callback did not happen.  Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised, but in the end I feel a little taken by them.  The stereotypical "use car salesman" mentality certainly applies to AV Chevrolet.  Buyer beware!!!< /Review>

He made our experience great because our 1st experience years ago in another dealership was awful but he went above and beyond!! He completely understood our budget and worked with us to get a monthly and down we were comfortable with and advised us on extra stuff! I truly enjoyed his service. The lot had one price 22k and online had 19k and they went for the online price which was awesome because they didn't try to play with number so I appreciated that a lot. Definitely will recommend Ivan to friends a family and everyone else he's amazing!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>The experience of purchasing a new vehicle was a pleasant one. I felt very comfortable the moment I walked onto the dealership grounds because I was not pursued or hounded.  I merely stated that if I needed assistance, I would let them know. Once I made up my mind as to what I wanted to do, Renz was the sales person that assisted me. From that moment on, I felt very pleased with the processing of my order and the attention that was provided to my order. Overall it was a very pleasant experience....from start to finished. I’m totally SATISFIED with my new 2018 Traverse - High Country. Absolutely an Outstanding vehicle.<//Review><rate>5<//rate>< pictures>

<Review>Customer service and satisfaction are greatly lacking at Antelope Valley Chevrolet. After a handful of extremely disappointing service visits and the recent theft of my money I will never go back far any reason whatsoever. I will tell everyone I know how bad my experience was, and not to patronize Antelope Valley Chevrolet if at all possible. After "fixing" my vehicle I get no more than 15 miles away and my check engine light comes back on for the same problem in brought it in for. Rendering my car inoperable I was told to "keep driving and maybe it will go away". I brought it back and got a loaner and upon return of said loaner I was falsely accused of having an animal in the vehicle. I did have hair on my clothes which transferred to the car but I never had an animal inside at all. $350 was stolen from me to "clean" the hair my clothes left behind. I was then threatened to be charged even more for "loss of use" if I would continue with my claims with the BBB and GM owner  services. Stay away from this dealer like the plague and even more so the service department as well as Jack Oh. Disappointment will surely follow if you don't heed these warnings.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1552319689774, 'text': 'Our team has acknowledged this review.'}< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c25afbe425eae5:0xf85f5bd071e6c797</Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Very disappointed it, I went to this dealer looking to get a truck hoping to get a good deal,first a non experience sell rep was “helping” us taking for ever giving us the information and to do the driving test, so far I found what I was looking for, then we met the manager who was very rude, so we started talking about deals which there was none because the truck I wanted to get was a 2019,then he told us that if we couldn’t afford something like that we shouldn’t get one,he didn’t help at all, we felt we were forced to get something we didn’t like, we waited almost 6 hours because he was so busy he said helping other deal when there was only a few people buying that day, so far we waisted it all day and we ended it up not buying anything,too bad because I really wanted to buy a truck</Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Awful service !!!! Save yourself the headache,and just drive the extra 30 minutes and go to Santa Clarita Chevy, you’ll be glad you did. I initially came to the service department because the parking sensors on my 18 Silverado went bad. Ashlee was my service rep, at first they went through the standard protocol and made me leave my truck over night to get diagnosed, as I stated Ashlee told me the sensors were bad and that they would order new ones which would get there in a week or so. So I scheduled an appointment for the following week to have the new sensors installed.  When I returned Ashlee told me the job would be done in a couple of hours I agreed to leave the truck over night to have them work it. The following day I received a call from Ashlee saying my truck was NOT ready and that they needed to keep the truck an extra day to work on it. “So much for a couple of hours”. Two days later I received another call from Ashlee telling me the new sensors they had ordered did not work either and told me to go pick up the truck. So I returned 2 days later to find my truck in worse condition then when I took it in. They had not only left the sensors broken, but disabled by seats motor function, something that was working fine when I took it in. Ashlee’s response was they needed to order another set of sensors and that it would take an additional week to get there. She had told me to return the next week ONCE AGAIN and that they would take care of the problem. After another week of waiting (now week 3) the day had come to take my truck in AGAIN for the third time regarding the same issue, I called the dealer to confirm my appointment before taking it, it turned out Ashlee had never scheduled me to go in, not only that when I spoke to another service rep I was informed that Ashlee never ordered the sensors like she had told me she was going to do. And to make matters worse I tried several times to get a hold of her, never once did she make an attempt to call me back, it was obvious she was intentionally avoiding me. So now after a wasted 3 weeks I was left with a truck that still had broken parking sensors and now had faulty seats along with a service rep that would not return my calls. This just goes to show that good customer service is something AV Chevy does not care about!! Never again will I return to this dealership, I will be taking my business to Santa Clarita a place I suggest you take your vehicle as well to avoid going through all this hassle.< /text><Name>miguel rodriguez</Name><response>{'time': 1555440254377, 'text': 'Thank you for reaching out to us, your experience is taken seriously by our entire team.

If there was a no stars review I would give them 0. I booked an appointment at 12:30pm and did not leave until 5pm. They did not communicate, I received my first text message from them at 3:45pm . There was a lack of respect for my appointment. What is the point of appointments if they’re going to overbook and make us wait 5 HOURS for what was clearly stated takes approximately 2 hours max.<//Review>

Great customer service. My sales guy was very personable. And Rhonda was amazing!!!! She was the light at the end of the tunnel and made the end process bearable. She was awesome!
The reason I'm giving them 3 stars because my husband took my car in to get service and they quoted 2 hours... he was there from 7:30 - 1:00pm. They offered a ride and didn't follow through to take him home. They actually came out, saw him, and then they were shocked that he was still there. They need to keep the customer updated on service being done. He could have been home relaxing.< /Text>

It was very busy when I arrived, but I was checked in quickly. My service advisor, Anthony Latanzio, was very courteous and helpful. My car required a new water pump and Anthony kept me informed throughout the day and my car was ready in time to take it home the same day. Despite the hectic schedule and the repair I was very satisfied with my experience. I live in Tehachapi but I will continue to bring my car to Antelope Valley Chevrolet for service.< /Review>

As far as car dealerships go they try to be good but, like most dealerships, they are mostly like vultures! As there are a couple of good salespeople. Best Chevy dealer in town, and if you are willing to take some time and be a hard sell you can get a good deal here, but be willing to walk away, they will come after you if it's a good deal<//Review>

The service department was unresponsive and abysmally slow. My son took his car in for service one day and asked for a tire sensor to be checked along with a check engine light. Two days later they finally managed to get his car back to him. They didn't return his calls either day; instead they texted and called me several times.  Each time he and I reminded them it was his car. This is in addition to the fact that he made sure they had his information on file qhen they took the car. Apparently,  since I had my car serviced there once I'm now going to get all his calls.  After a ridiculous run around he finally told them to just give him his car back. The advisor said she would have it ready when he arrived and he would just have to pay the diagnostic fee. We get there and wait 20 minutes for Advisor Ashlee who run around another 10 minutes looking for his car only to come back and tell him they found a nail in his tire, it's unrepairable, and will be done in 25 minutes for 125 plus mounting.  45 minutes later it's done. Why she didn't tell him about this before he came over, why having a tire replaced  doesn't mean the $150 diagnostic fee for tire sensor and engine light still needs to be paid, why he didn't receive a profuse apology from the service manager when I informed her of the run around... I guess we'll never know since we're not going to buy or return for service there.</Text>

< Review>
Worst customer service of any Chevy dealership I've been to. Took my 2018 Corvette w/ 10k miles in, due to my dash bubbling up from the material being cut too short. We submit the claim on a Saturday Oct 26, was told they would call me Monday or Tuesday....nothing. I texted them Tuesday....nothing. I finally called them Friday andl left a message. I was told I'll get a call back that day....nothing. I called back again mid-week and even reported this all on the company's sight. Still nothing...my dash is covered under warranty, but still not even a call back, going on 2 weeks.< /Review>

Service person was helpful, friendly, and polite.  However, one of the complaints was inadvertently not added to the paperwork, resulting in the vehicle needing to remain in service for 3 additional day, after being in for 3 weeks.  Presently, it is apparent that the Point Inspection may not have been done.  The tire pressure was the same as drop off and the brakes appears to be vibrating when braking.</text>

I don't know how their service  department is supposed to work but it DOESN'T!
Had an appointment @9:30, parked in the line up (which I was instructed to do for a previous appt.) and at 10 no one had yet taken notice or spoken to me!
Got out and found the service supervisor and a service advisor he was talking to took me in.
It then took 2 hours and 45 minutes for a tire rotation and "27 point inspection".
I saw my car being driven out of the service area and it took a half hour for it to be driven up front and returned to me.
Maybe it's because this is a N/C warranty service but as far as I'm concerned it's totally unacceptable!
I'll never buy, lease or have service done here ever again.
While waiting I spoke to another customer who was there before me, by appointment for just a tire rotation and he was still waiting for his vehicle when I left !!!
I feel obligated to say that the service advisors are quite nice and easy to deal with but SOMETHING is wrong here.</Review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Horrible experience. We dropped off our Camaro 2017 to replace the 2 handles in the doors at our appointment time, 9:30an on Saturday August 24th 2019. We waited in the lobby until 3:00pm and they told us that they couldn't replace the handles because they got the wrong parts.

Chevy dealer in Lancaster CA is the most incompetent and unprofessional place we had been.
I can't believe how many hours we waited without food or drinks.

I would never buy a car again with Chevrolet. How come the doors were bad after 2 yrs?
My husband and I cut our fingers on this doors. I emailed them a few weeks ago, and they started sending us ads with cars to sell us another car. But we never heard about the wounds in our fingers.

Everyone were not friendly and they were very unprofessional. They just want to sell you a car, but nobody want to be responsible for the damages in the car or our wounds in our fingers. Horrible service and horrible place to go to. 😢😭<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1566840813980, 'text': 'I would like to speak with you directly in order to better understand the circumstances you’ve described and reach a satisfactory resolution together.

Check engine light came back on within 30 miles of driving. Brought my car back in. "Fixed" it again to the tune of $490. Swore this time the check engine light would remain off. Check engine light came on before I even got home from the dealership - less than 15 miles. Called to speak to the service rep or the manager and was told they were both busy but would return my call. Been almost 24 hours and nobody has bothered to contact me. I am out almost $900 and my check engine light was not resolved, The mechanics obviously suck and the service reps don't seem to care. They got your money so screw you.

<review>Brought my 2014 Cruze in on March 2016. I was told I needed a new catalytic converter (check engine light was on) reluctantly I did so under warranty. However driving out of state I got an oil change about 1 month later and was told all that was changed was my muffler. I was cheated. Hate this place</review><user_name>oh no<//user_name>< rate>

My car sat their unchecked for hours until I got a call at 2 saying they hadn’t done the diagnostic and needed me to leave it overnight. Annoying to see that they didn’t care enough to take two minutes out of their busy schedule to do a two minute diagnostic. They are just a waste of time.< /Text>< resp>

<Text>We dealt w/ our service adviser the most. He was kind and personable. It was great for him to offer us a rental when our van had to stay an extra day. My only issue is I had to wait nearly 45 min when picking up my van upon it's completion b/c I had not obtained a receipt from Enterprise. Enterprise wouldn't give me a receipt b/c they had not received approval from Chevy. I don't know service adviser lingo. I don't know what a "PO" is. The piece of paper our service adviser handed me before Enterprise came to get us, was supposed to be given to Enterprise but I was unaware of this. I was told it "pays the bill". It would have been better had I been told "make sure this paper is given to Enterprise". I like our service adviser, but my mind was not on his track, and it cost me 45 min of my time & cost him his time also. The van seems to be running better but the idle problem & starter "cough" isn't 100% resolved. It's better but not completely gone. Not sure right now what my husband will decide to do about it.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I'm writing to review my experience buying a Chevy Bolt. The staff was very friendly and candid. Paul H. helped project an image of trust and honesty. In finance, Rhonda was personable, a quick worker, and also nice. In the purchasing process I was able to keep in frequent contact with Rhonda which helps avoid surprises and misunderstandings. That's the good, but there are opportunities for improvement: Some of the Chevrolet materials had errors. For instance, the Bolt materials indicated need for an oil change, which is not true. I would appreciate more up front information on recommended service schedules for the Bolt and Volt(and maybe all cars?). I had to ask and the staff had to dig up the information. The more transparency, the better the dealership experience. In addition, the dealership sent me home without the charging cable; I noticed and was able to get one without hassle immediately, but this could have been a big issue considering the car had not been charged and was delivered with about 15% battery capacity. The dealership talked me into an option contract to take the car immediately. It was not well-communicated what the option contract was, and what the time lines were, and what it would mean to me in different financial scenarios. I would say this feels a little bit like the dealership setting a trap for me and adds to the negative perception people have towards dealerships. I would not feel that way if the options contract was explained along with possible financing scenarios; I should not have to ask. As far as Chevy communicating its vision through the dealership, I think Chevy needs to do a better regarding electric vehicles. I've heard that dealerships might be installing charging stations which would be a great way to compete with Tesla's charging network, but the dealership had no information on this and I don't see much online either.<//text>

<Text>We have been with this dealership since they opened. In fact, we have been with the owners of this dealership since 1997, as Saturn of the AV.
Your experience, here, can be great. Every experience is what you make it.
Some of the reviews on Yelp aren't the best. To those people I say, do your homework on how to buy a car. Everyone will run a credit check. They don't want to sell you a car you can't afford. They want you to drive away happy and not burdened. AV Chevy will get you the best possible interest rate , even if your credit is not the best.
We have leased, bought and most recently, special ordered our latest vehicle, a Chevy Colorado diesel.
Only once in all that time did we ever have a bad word to say about anyone. That one person was soon after let go.
Go in with a listening ear and learn. Everyone is prepared to help you have a good experience. If you go in with a know-it-all attitude or you're not satisfied with your sales or service rep, ask for someone else. Buying a vehicle or having your vehicle serviced is like a marriage, all of us work well with certain personality types better than others.
Like I said, we're totally satisfied. That's why we've gone back time after time.
As far as servicing goes, if they say that your vehicle needs something or it can wait for another 5,000 miles, do what they say. It will cost you less in the long run. If you can put that new alternator in yourself, do it, otherwise quit complaining when it gives out. They really don't want to say I told you so.
Satisfied in Palmdale!</Text>< username>

My service person was Steven. I would call and he would never return my calls. My car has been there for over 3 weeks and it still is not fixed. I talked to Nicole the manager of service and she kept leaving her desk so she would have to talk to no one. I went in and as I was waiting for Nicole to return to her desk, Steven was talking to the mechanics about sports. Over the loud speakers, the called him and he continued to talk I stead of servicing the clients. I'm waiting for the owner Justin to call me back before I make a complaint with consumer affairs</text>

And after they said they couldn't find my info on the system for the why the car was being checked  and then the person liliana lazo just kept on typing without me being notify of what was going on. So all I can say just my first visit was a great experience,  other than that they just try to get you out af fast as they can. An apology would of been nice for the 20mim delay . 30min after and I'm still here🤦‍♀️</Review>< gmapID>

Went in for oil change. Staff extremely courteous from first to last staff. All of my questions and concerns answered. Made comfortable in the waiting room. Was told if I  thought of any other questions or concerns just to call service advisor. I've purchased two cars from AV Chevrolet,  love those friendly people over there. Fantastic service every time</Review>

Very disappointed I spoke with a sales rep over the phone told me he would help me to the fullest with no down. Today I drove from LA to the AV for nothing sales rep I spoke over the phone is not a man of his word he later on told me I had to put 10% of the truck I wanted. Again very disappointed.< /review>

The worst experience ever.  AV Chevrolet took advantage of my 82 year old mother.  my niece and her husband went in to purchase a vehicle and could not qualify so they asked my Mom if she would co-qualify with them which she thought she was doing.  Never did the salesperson from AV Chevrolet let my Mom know that she was actually buying the car for my crooked relatives.  Nor did they ever check to find out if my Mom could even drive which she cannot.  When I was made aware of this transaction was when my niece and her husband couldn’t make the car payments and the bank contacted my Mom that she was responsible and she didn’t understand.  We called the bank and their recommendation was to take the car back to the dealer and work with them on the issue.  AV Chevrolet offered no assistance and offer $25,000 less to purchase the vehicle back 3 months after they originally sold it for more than the sticker value.  My Mom had to write a check from her hard earned retirement savings in order to get out of the fraudulent vehicle purchase that was handled by AV Chevrolet.  AV Chevrolet are crooks, crooks, crooks!</review>

<text>We had Kyle as our service writer. He made sure that my daughter's car had a thorough inspection to find any other issues besides the ones I brought the vehicle in to address.   His price quotes were thorough and accurate and he took the extra time to go over each service item to make sure we understood. My daughter's 2008 Saturn Vue is running like new again.

<text>I am very unsure as to why, even when you get the first appointment in the morning, it still takes 1.5 hours for an oil change and tire rotation. Its hard to convince myself that the Chevrolet dealership is actually the best place to get my AV Chevy purchased Silverado serviced in the future. I can, by myself, do that same service in less time and have less experience and not at all the same equipment and tooling. Customer service is great, service time, not great at all.

UPDATE: I called to talk to Nicole, She proceeded to tell me that the 27 point inspection is what takes the longest time. She said they want to make sure everything is right with the vehicles before returning them. I forgot to mention in my previous post, while doing the "walk around" of the vehicle before the service, the person decided they did not care too much and just wrote that my truck, which was washed the day before, was too dirty to see any dents in it. Therefore if they damaged it, they would not be responsible.  I am not sure why they want to discuss and want honest feedback when they just want to make themselves feel like they are the victim.< /text>< pics>

We recently broke our hummer ,H3.. Never a great experience.. But Antelope valley Chevy made it a most enjoyable adventure. From the moment we were towed in,till we waved goodbye .
I felt completely at home and among friends,even though we had never met.
Our top notch expert service writer,Randy was great!  My husband,Jon, suffers from acute anxiety,often he has trouble dealing with just these kind of situations. No problem with the staff and RANDY. Competence and charm oozed from Randy.
Hard to believe we arrived at 2 in the afternoon and by 5 we had a diagnoses and replacement parts ordered.. The next day Randy told us our Hummer was ready and we were surprised at how early it was.We were home in Santa Ynez before dark!
Once again My husband and I were both delighted with the service and feel we now have friends in Lancaster,
Thanks,Karen K. Kozlov & Jon C. Baker
P.S. Glen our service tech was all over the job and had the work done on time and on budget, as promised!! I have never hugged a service tech before but Glen was great!!!< /text>

The sales experience was OK, Matthew was pleasant, friendly and helpful. The negotiations on the other hand were confusing and lacking information unless specifically requested. I have a due bill and there has been no follow up. I called to set an appointment and spoke with someone who told me nothing would be done on the due bill until after the financing was settled. Then I received a call from Matthew who told me I would be contacted by following Wednesday for someone to set up my appointment. That is the last I've heard from anyone at your dealership except for a mailing  I received with information on the preferred owner program.< /Text>

<Text>Took the car in for a TPMS sensor malfunction.  Told them the sensors were not changed after a tire rotation too and the service rep said "no problem, that's an easy fix". I also asked them to check headlight and they estimated $150, but didn't estimate any other costs. Was later contacted by text and they said nothing wrong with headlight but replacing the sensor would be $390. I politely declined the service and expected no cost as the estimate for the headlight was not needed. When I picked up my car, they charged me $75 for re-learning the sensors. When I asked about it because this was not part of the estimate they said "oops, that was my bad, sorry" but because it was less than the headlight estimate (which was not needed) I was still required to pay. Not cool.<//Text>< rating>

<review>My husband and I came ready with money in hand to buy a truck cash and they were trying to add $5,000 out of thin air we had all the calculations perfectly added with the 10% taxes for California and the DMV registration and they had no explanation as to where the $5,000 were coming from except that they had to tax us on all the extra things that the truck had although that did not say that anywhere in the description of the price. It said the price and that was all that it said since when do they charge taxes just because the truck has extra things the price with clearly was there on the tag. Very disappointed but I'm glad that I went somewhere else be careful because they're liars and they're deceiving and they're going to try to charge you extra so make sure you do your constellations< /review></record>

<Text>Joey Gonzales performed at a high level of professionalism, weight my options, worked extremely hard to get approval based on my recent bankruptcies and presented the best available offer for approval according to my personal and financial needs.  The AV Chevy team- Joey Gonzales,  Lamel Scott and Nina should be commended for their great team effort. I would highly recommend anyone to purchase at Antelope Valley Chevrolet...

Joey Gonzales at AV Chevrolet demonstrated more than sales expertise in the field of auto selling and financing, he demonstrated the art of listening to this particular customer.  I strongly believe in HE WHO LISTENS WINS and it was a Win! Win! for all of us.< /Text>< UserId.>

Service  does not want to hear or fix my concerns on my car. Service writer was very pushy, trying to say I needed services done or my warranty would be void. I looked in the manual and I was not due for any of those services at that time. Their multi-point inspection is a waste of time, they do not do any inspection of the car at all. 5 days before I got my car serviced there, I myself replaced engine air filter and in cabin air filter. They still told me that I need to change it soon. I called them out on that and day did not want to deal with my concern.

Bottom line, take your vehicle elsewhere, there are plenty of other dealerships that will gladly help you out. Unfortunately Antelope Valley Chevrolet will give you the run-around.< /Text>

<resp>None</resp><Name>Laramie Evans<//Name><Review>I had to take my vehicle back multiple times for the same issue. Finally, when they did fix the issue, they created another issue by not putting it back together properly which caused me to have to bring the vehicle back AGAIN! Service Advisor Francisco was nice and respectful and apologetic but it seemed as if his hands were tied and he couldn't assist me in the way that he would've liked to. Service Manager Roberto initially seemed to be on top of my issues but soon turned out to be very non communicative. He did not respond to my emails or phone calls. I escalated my concerns to General Manager Justin Gonzales and he was extremely rude and aggressive and intimidating. I felt bullied and verbally assaulted to such an extent that I was afraid to go pick up my vehicle. I actually called a friend who is a peace officer to escort me . because I was so fearful. I will NEVER take my vehicle to this dealership again! I will tell everyone I know not to do business with them! The treatment I received was appalling< /Review>< Date>

If you don't have an appt, and your specific service advisor is not in, DO NOT COME HERE! Being the only Chevy dealer in the Antelope Valley, they know you have no other options to get certain things done. It is ridiculous that I have been waiting almost 2 hours to get a fob programmed. 😡< /review>

Our check engine light came on after climbing the Tehachapi Pass,in early October 2018 while pulling a fifth wheel with our 2006 2500HD Chevy Silverado.  We were able to drive into Lancaster, CA to Antelope Valley Chevrolet who said they could fit us in and were able to shuttle us to the fairgrounds where we had left our RV. The service department determined that we needed two sensors replaced on our vehicle, a turbo sensor and a cam shaft sensor. Even though their communication was lacking after about five days (a weekend didn't help) they were able to get us back on the road. We returned home to Oregon with the truck working fine. Then in mid November we experienced trouble with the truck intermittently refusing to start. After being towed to our local Chevrolet dealer twice, they were finally able to determine that the Cam shaft sensor which Antelope Valley Chevrolet had installed for us, was installed incorrectly leading to corrosion and a short. The technician at AV Chevrolet had left off a seal/gasket causing the corrosion. In early December once the truck was repaired, we contacted Nicole the service manager asking for help with the $518 in repair costs we incurred due to their error. She told us to send pictures of the part, invoices, etc. and told us she would talk with the general manager and get back to us. In mid January after not hearing back from Nicole, we emailed again and received no response. At the end of January we emailed the general manager with all of our information and once again received no reply. We gave them every opportunity to help make this right and basically they blew us off. I would not recommend this dealership to any one for service of their vehicle unless they have no other options available. Our local dealership Suburban Chevrolet in Sandy, OR is fantastic and would never treat a customer like this. Even if they could not help financially, they would at least take the time to discuss the problem and try to come up with some solution. We have also dealt with Chevrolet dealerships in Crescent City, CA and Fresno, CA who were also fantastic and provided the service we have come to expect from Chevrolet dealerships. I have also contacted Chevrolet to let them know that their Antelope Valley Chevrolet Service Department does not live up to the quality and service that should be expected from a Chevrolet dealer.

I tried to give no stars as that is what they deserve, but I cannot post this review without giving at least one star.<//review>

Customer service is great when you're buying or trading in your car... which my husband and I did both. Then when you need service or something after they are the worst I've ever dealt with. My key broke within the first year. And it's not cheap! Then 2 yrs in I get a flat tire and need my spare or donut and it's not there! I've never opened that part of my trunk because I've not needed it before. Its 2 yrs later, and I call and the girl who answered the phone just said, "I dont know what you expect us to do 2 yrs later. And after a second raised her voice to cut me off and repeat that I could speak with her manager". Every time I got my car serviced my keys were no where to be found after receiving a call that it was ready. Then my paperwork was missing. I will never go back nor reccomend this place.<//Review>

<Review>I am from Fairbanks Alaska but i called this dealership because they had a very specific Escalade we had been looking for all over the country (mid row bench seat instead of buckets) i had money in hand and was ready to wire it. They initially treated me as a scammer which did not offend me, i had my banker reach out to the General Sales Manager and we did everything in our power to buy this vehicle from them. The manager said “let’s wait until Monday, if it’s still available, i will sell it to you, i have a list of 20 buyers looking for this vehicle.” This absolutely blew me away, i was a customer trying to buy the vehicle. Needless to say, i took my cash elsewhere and put my wife in a brand new Denali which cost every penny as much as the Escalade. Needless to say, it’s been over two weeks and that Escalade is STILL sitting there. What happened to the 20 buyers?<//Review>< pics>

I had a scheduled appointment for an oil change and wiper replacement.  After a 3 hour wait, I recieved my truck.  They didn't complete all the services noted, only the oil was changed.
Next time, I would rather drive down to Chevy of Montebello where I bought my truck.  They gave me free oil changes and service is better.< /review>

For having gone in expecting to need a repair with no intention or preperation to be leaving with a new car I could not have felt more assured and truely in the best of hands. From Joey Gonzales in the Service dept, Richard the sales associate who became almost a friend who eased all of my concerns as to my decision as well as everyone else who contributed to create an overall wonderful experience. I believe its a true reflection of the amazing owner Justin Gonzales who's professionalism mixed with genuine customer service that had made me continue to be a returning satisfied customer</text>

Service was good, but the mechanic who worked on my car left the hood open. I didn’t notice until I began picking up speed on the freeway. That’s when it began flapping. I quickly reduced speed and pulled over. I probably won’t be going back to this location seeing as how this was only my second visit and mistakes like that are unacceptable. The staff I interacted with was ok in my experience. Both times I brought my vehicle here I left it overnight so I was in and out. However picking my vehicle up the second time was when I noticed why some of the bad reviews were posted. I was told the vehicle was ready and when I arrived my service rep said give me a minute without even looking up at me. I stood there for about ten minutes. I noticed another service rep giving a different customer the same treatment. He asked her three times if she wanted him to just find someone who wasn’t busy (obviously in a hurry) she would just say hold on and go back to typing. My service rep was walking back and forth without looking at me or saying anything. More customers were walking in forming a line behind both me and the other gentleman. Like the both of us, they weren’t greeted they just stood there. Finally my service rep produced a paper for me to sign. Handed me my copy (1/5 stars for her attitude btw) and said come with me. She walked me out to the lot, but then handed my fob to a mechanic she noticed walking by and told me he’d pull my car around. I said thanks and she said nothing.< /text>

The service department gave me a exorbitant price to fix my Blazer.
What was known to be a MAF issue was diagnosed as a blown cylinder. I had my car serviced before I left Arizonia and everything was fine. I came into California and as soon as I used the high additive gasoline that they sell in California my car started acting up. It did have a MAF issue before I moved to Arizonia and while I was there I had no issues. Once I came back to California the MAF sensor started acting up. This service department diagnosed it as a BLOWN CYLINDER and said they could replace the engine for about $8000. As I cleaned oug my car, the mechanic that diagnosed my car was standing behind me telling me he was going to buy my car as soon as I was gone. I was in the desert, far from home and I felt I was taken advantage of. Reading some of the other reviews I found this was not the first time this has happened to someone who came in with the same issue. Not a company I would recommend. It seems that all of the Chevrolet dealers are the same as I have been treated the same way by every one I have gone to. I have been a Chevrolet driver most of my life and I can honestly say Chevrolet is no longer a good company to deal with.< /Text>

<text>DO NOT GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP. SALES STAFF ARE LIARS AND HUSTLERS. I went to buy a used car from them and after they shuffled me between 4-5 different sales reps, they told me that they would hide the car during my 2 hour drive to their dealership. My father and fiance drive for an hour, then I get a call saying the car may or may not be sold. We ask them if we should still drive to the dealership and they said "yes come". They screwed with us for 3 hours trying to get us to buy a car out of our budget then we left. Very rude staff. Awful management. Just drive to LA dealership.</text>< pictures>

Last Saturday we had an appointment to get the oil changed on our 2018 chevy cruze, well the appointment was at 1230, my fianc arrived at 1215 and literally took 3 hours for them to finished the oil change, the 26 point inspection or whatever wasn't even performed. When we went up to ask for the 5th time where the car was they told us it had been ready for over 30 mins! 30 mins we wasted sitting waiting for someone who never came. AND my care was filthy when i got it back and i had just had it detailed!</Review>

Jenelle at Service did an outstanding job taking care of my Chevy Silverado.  Went in for a routine oil change and a few minor things.  The technician found a coolant/radiator/reservoir leak.  After coordinating with the warranty for the repairs, she was also able to to help me get new tires given the circumstances and additional coordination.  Outstanding customer service!<//text>

< Review>
I give ZERO  stars to this horrid place !
I purchased 2 vehicles from them,  and have never dealt with such disaster customer service.  There is zero communication between service members and management and mechanics . I can't even being to list the stories,  I made the mistake by giving them the benefit of the doubt by returning after my first bad encounter,  another time when my vehicle broke down felt I had no choice.  One incident was a broken def fluid line , the parts were not in stock and they had to order it this was a Friday and they would Be in touch Monday.  Well Monday came and went as well as 2.5 weeks of no contact from the dealer , no one returned my calls , nor did I recieve calls then when I was contacted they didn't even know what repair it was there for!  After that I left a poor review for that service rep, and hours later he called me saying how dare I leave him a poor  review and I have no right  to judge how he does business and that I'm taking money from him by leaving him with my true opinion.   It was like pulling teeth to get a loaner car even though I was under warranty,  during this time my other new Chevy was in for a recall and again refused a loaner vehicle even though it was still under warranty . Each time I have dealt with this place there's been nothing but hostility.  I've had a few loaners and returned no problems and then this last one my husband had reminence of dog hair from shoes and clothes on the Floor and from our kids car seat and the service member did a walk around checked it all out said it was fine and good to go, the next day  the sales manager called saying they were going to have to completley replace the interior due to us having having animals in the car !  The amount of hair could have been picked up in 5 mins with a peice of duct tape . I would have done that of the didn't call us last minute to get our beloved car that had been out for 2 weeks , we wanted our car back and in the last 2 years the traces of dog hair  had never been an issue , but now it was 350$ the next day after they  change their minds.  Being that almost 24 hours past after we returned the vehicle We believe this was retaliation due to our negative reviews to expose the bad business that goes on here, Then after we complained to the manager and told them how disappointed we are with how they leave their customers in the dark they threatened us with more fees is we reported them toGM!
That right there says how crooked they are when then can't handle criticism  and make adjustments  they instead threaten customers  to make them retreat and keep their mouths closed to hide their bad business.
Stay away from av Chevrolet!< /Review>

<review>See Jolie if you need a car. She is straight up with you and won't sell you what you don't need. She puts the entire product line out there, finds out your needs and fits the right vehicle to your needs. She won't push higher end unless that's what your looking for. She is truly old school when it comes to customer service. She's there for you, not just to make a commission.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>We were passing through and had a persistent check engine light that we couldn't remedy.  Although we were pressed for time, had 2 dogs with us, and the temperature was 105 outside, we pulled into the dealership and explained our predicament.  They were very professional and quick in getting to us, even though they were busy and we weren't scheduled, but the technician explained it could be at least a couple of hours and there would be labor charges.  We settled in under a tree with our dogs in the midday heat, but soon had a call from the technician, that, although it was lunch hour, they knew we were on the road and waiting in the heat, and a mechanic had looked at it, determined the cause of the light, and it was nothing that was serious enough to need repair before we got home.  And then he graciously told us that there wouldn't be any charge, and they hoped we had a good trip, and sent us on our way!  We would highly recommend them!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>First the parts department does not close at 7 it closes at 6, it would be nice if the chevy dealer would fix that online. Second i arrived at parts at 6:01 and the parts guy was still standing there but would not help me. I do not think they truly care about customer satisfaction. So instead im going to get my parts from somewhere else. Lost a customer.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I know everybody has there own opinions when we write reviews on these businesses and things as such. Well I'm going to be 100% honest. This place sucks I mean no communication and the lack of respect for customers they won't call you when they say they would I understand things happen and they get busy I get it. But y do I have to keep calling over and over to get an update on my car from the service department. First of a I'm worried my engine may have went out. So it's really bothering me y can't u guys give a common courtesy call and say hey it's not looking so good or it's looking good don't worry. Don't just hold the car and not communicate with the owner. Every time u call no matter if the call is seconds apart the lady ask the same question over and over and that's annoying. Just transfer me to the service department. I don't want to be grilled. I wouldn't be calling ur business if my car wasn't there. Bottom line. I know it's a dealership and they get busy but have some common courtesy and communicate with ur customers<//review>

Very polite, courteous, helpfull. Service writers explained everything that they would do. Called me while we were out walking to let us know it was done and being washed. I will continue to drive to AV Chevy from Valencia.  Valencia treats customers very poorly. And AV gained our service as well as our friends and family.</text>

<review>I had an 8 am appointment and when I arrived, no one was around. Finally found a service person who looked up my info and had me wait for Iris. Iris was really helpful, and made sure everything was done quickly. Although a lot of work was being done, I never had to wait too long before she updated me on the work.</review><userid>101878392693086180103< /userid></record></dataset><record>

We were very satisfied with the customer service that Samuel Garcia provided to us. He explained as many details as possible about the vehicle we were looking at. He was very upfront and honest and overall we had a great experience at AV chevy.</Review>

I had a very negative  experience  in buying  a car from this place.First I  went there to purchase  a new Chevy  Cruze  that online was listed as $11,000 plus.I had cash to pay but when I  got there was told that price only applied  if I  was financing  the car because  of the rebates that were offered.Now that basically  meant to me that I  was being  discriminated  against  for being  a cash buyer.I decided  reluctantly  to buy a 2013 Cruze  and the process took four hours before I  was done and out the  doir.A week later the water pump went out on the car.Not a happy customer  at all.< /text>

I love this place, I will always go here for my suv  and car service, I had gone to Jiffy Lube for an oil change I thought it would be less expensive than the car dealership, I was quoted  $119.00 plus taxes, a week or two later I went to another Jiffy Lube, as I was waiting  in line I called Antelope Valley Chevrolet, I was quoted $59.00 plus taxes for ACDelco dexos Full Synthetic, 8-Quart Oil Change, 4-Tire Rotation, Multi-Point Vehicle Inspection, I was blown away.  I was quoted $119.99 again at Jiffy Lube second location, I backed out of Jiffy Lube and left. I drove 3 to 5 minutes to AV Chevrolet, dropped my SUV off.  I was asked if I wanted to wait and If I did there were coffee and donuts inside, I had to go to work, I came back later pick up my SUV, It fell like a new SUV, my SUV was washed vacuumed tired rotated oil changed my brakes felt supper tight etc, etc, etc, I will always go to Antelope Valley Chevrolet for car service, I'm telling my family and friend to go there as well. I have always though car dealerships were more costly and boy was I wrong. I highly recommend Antelope Valley Chevrolet for car or truck service.< /text>

Last time I looked you make an appointment you get seen by your appt. but not at this place, I had appt for oil change for 12:30 I was even early, was told tech that was suppose to take car of me just went to lunch they will find someone else to take care of me. ok I waited for awhile just to be told it was going to be a 3 hr wait... excuse me I had an appt for 12:30. if I wanted to wait all day I would have just walked in and not made appointment. Service there used to be great it's not anymore, I'm so disappointed! not my first bad experience there this is just my final attempt going there.

Worst dealer in the AV. I bought a brand new Chevy Cruz from them. I bought into a customer program. I was to do all my service with them and they would cover the first $1000.00 for new tires. I took my car there for 3 years, when it came time to get new tires, I was told that program was not active any more. Yet they never said a word when I was still getting my service there. So not only did the charge me for the program but they failed to carry out with there promises. I asked for a refund only to be ignored. Don't buy from these crooks.</text>

I have always owned a Chevy but, when you tell service adviser what the car is doing, and they put down 'customer says car makes ticking and flapping noise' even though that's not what you told them. And the cashier acted like she was annoyed when I ask to see the paperwork, so I knew if the problem was fixed, before I signed, or pay for services. This last service is when I realized AV Chevy is going down hill. I used to love the advisers there. They had great personality, they had a sense of humor, and they listened to you. The advisors now, do not have any of those qualities. Less than a week after this service at AV Chevy,  I traded in my Chevy Equinox for a Dodge.</Text>

Service Center Review:

I have visited this dealership 3 times for warranty service, and each time I have left with a headache due to frustration. Every step of the process takes far longer than it should due to under staffing, unnecessary steps, and antiquated systems.

For all but one warranty repair, I have had to battle with the service representative for the issue to be fixed under warranty.

Making an appointment is worthless as you will be expected to wait for extended periods regarless, and they have proven incapable of providing anything close to a reasonable estimate of when work will begin on vehicles, let alone when it will be complete.

I strongly recommend that individuals steer clear of this service center.</Review>

Save time and money go to Motor City GMC or Keyes Chevrolet if you are looking for a truck. I haven't purchased a vehicle from AV Chevy since they first opened. I always start out there to try and shop local. They just have never been competitive with the other dealers I mentioned in my experiences there.< /review>

If any of my friends own GM products, in my own opinion they do not back their product. I have 2010 Chevy equinox with engine oil consumption issue and a special warranty up to 120,000 mile warranty. My vehicle has only 103,000 miles due to oil consumption my Chevrolet Equinox is needing a new engine due to internally deteriorating the engine. Antelope Valley Chevrolet in Lancaster, California has not provided any assistance. The service advisor Edward just said I can have you reach our sales department. I feel GM is not backing their product and trying to stick the price tag of $8,000 to their customer! Due to not having oil change records! I'm I'm severely disappointed, upset, and quite frankly mad as heck that no one even lend a hand to help! I'm sure all they want is money coming from their customers. As an active duty Marine this quite disrespectful and customer service there is none at all! Corporate senior advisor Jeremy even agreed he has seen and dealt with multiple cases in this matter. They not only did not diagnosis my vehicle properly by only doing oil change and finding metal flakes in filter. Which service bulletin states if cylinder walls are zebra striped the engine must be replaced by GM not at the customer expense! Corporate and dealership has done nothing to help! Do not buy their products!  Just spoke with service advisor Edward today March 29, 2017 they stated they would not fix it under the special warranty for the vehicle. I will be picking up my vehicle since they have done nothing to help. I will be bringing in the service bulletin and showing them exactly where it states everything. I will also find whatever I can for documentation and will show them. Either they will warranty the work or I'm filing official complaints with multiple agencies. For not following warranty work which I will have in black and white. #GM #Chevrolet #Dissapointedchevy owner #Activeduty #Marine< /Text>

I brought in my 2017 GM van for an air conditioning failure. Unfortunately for me, I was 10k miles out of warranty. So I was quoted $2,200.00 to replace all the A/C parts. Apparently there was no way to flush the system out from the type of failure.  When I said I couldn’t afford it, I was advised that they had special financing. I was suspicious of this and the diagnosis as we are service technicians as well.  So I paid the $130 estimate, picked up the vehicle and took it to MotorCity GMC in Bakersfield. They were able to fix it for, I kid you not, half! $1,104.95.  It was fixed in 2 days, it took more than that for Antelope Valley Chevrolet to get me an estimate with an explanation of why all the parts needed to be replaced.  My service advisor Steve was very nice and professional, I can’t speak for anyone else. I highly recommend GMC MotorCity in Bakersfield. Lynn at the service department was great.  If you’ve had a great experience, awesome.  My first was anything but. A 1 star because there is no Iower, others could have been taken advantage of.  I was smart enough to get a second estimate. It paid off!</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Came in without appt for oil change and was treated with respect and courtesy while they accommodated me for service. In order to expedite since I was waiting I was given the option to bypass a carwash. In the end my car was washed and everything done in a timely manner.

< Review>
I brought my cobalt in for an ignition recall. When I picked up my car I noticed the turn signal was not working and I am positive it was working when I brought it in.  I inspected the turn signal switch and noticed a definite crack on the lever at the base of the housing. The crack became bigger as you actuated the lever. It looks like someone accidentally hit it or something. I brought it back to have the part replaced witch they did after after a bunch of hesitation and asking a service tech (Daryl) what he thought. Daryl stated it would be hard to break but it was possible. I also showed him the crack witch he used his phone to inspect the crack and showed the service manager Johnny. It was evident that the part had a crack at the base of the lever causing it not to latch properly. Also Daryl said he had never seen a switch do what mine was doing. WELL NOW THE BAD PART... After picking up my car (witch they didn't charge me for)  The paperwork pretty much calls me a liar states " A customer states the turn signal switch was broken on last visit. CAUSE: Inspected turn signal lever assembly and found worn tilt for switch, NOT DUE TO REPAIRS LAST VISIT. Question can you call a crack wear on a part? I don't think so...A crack would indicate the part is broken and that caused the part to not function properly... NOT A WORN PART plus there is only 67,773 miles on the car. If parts are failing at this low of mileage I should get rid of my 3 Chevy's and my Cadillac. I work for a company (NASA) as an instrumentation specialist on structures. I know the difference between worn and broken parts. I have seen my fair share of parts..I mean that what I do for a living... PROTECTING THEIR PEOPLE AND CALLING ME A LIAR IS AWFUL BUSINESS PRACTICE. calling corporate tomorrow... Invoice # 67251< /Review>

< Review>
My husband and I wound up purchasing our Chevy Trax at a dealership elsewhere, because the sales team couldn't work the numbers we wanted. We live in Palmdale-so for service, year we want to drive down to Valencia, we are stuck using AV Chevrolet. I have complained multiple times about the horrible service and lack of communication, but the problem has not been rectified. It seems to get worse every time we go in for service.  We changed our mind on having the brakes serviced, due to the cost difference from when we called to when we arrived. After waiting for a quote for non oem parts(45 minutes later) we finally just left ...After it took additional time for the car to be brought around. Continually disappointing.<//Review>

Expect a long wait (3+ hours for oil change) IF they can get you in at your appointment time.  Sitting here AGAIN 4th time here for simple oil change and tire rotation.</review>

We were ignored and left outside in the cold for more than 30 minutes. Our appointment was at 4 and we arrived a little bit before 4. The workers just kept going back and forth ignoring me. Until I called the front desk and then the worker tried to make it seem like it was my fault. She said she was busy and that my appointment was suppose to be at 4, which I replied by saying yes I have been right outside your door for over half an hour. She then passed me off to another worker and told that worker that we were late anyways. Luckily the other worker helped us and we managed to get rushed out just in time before the place closed.</Review>

11/14/17 I brought my truck in to have some work done on the locking harness. 11/15/17 The next day, I was trying to get in touch with my service representative. I called around 1:30 pm. I left a message. About 2:45 I get a call back the representative was to call me back on the status on my truck. I said okay. At 4:19 since I still did not get a call back. I called again and left another message. At 4:20 I called again and the operator said she's been with customers had not had time to call me back. At 4:31 and 4:46 I call back again and left messages. I finally get a call back at 5:01 pm saying my truck has been done for a couple of hours. The representative told me she's been with customers all day and she didn't want to be rude answering her phone. I told her that I've been in this office before when representatives answered their phone while helping me. So, I go and pick up my truck my represenative doesn't say hi or anything. When the copies of the forms were printed she asked if I was ready to go back to the cashier. We get to the cashier and she hands her the forms, She didn't say thank you or by or come again. I asked to talk to the service manager and reported her behavior. I get my truck home. After I parked my truck in the drive way the same problem I had before 11/14/17 happened again. I thought okay this is weird and I just wasted $100 on a deductible. So I thought okay it might be my key fob. So I took the battery out of old keep fob and started using the 2nd one I received when I bought the truck. There has been no problem with my truck since. So I called the service manager on 11/18/17 to let him know what happened with my truck. He told me h'ed look into it and give me a call back on 11/20/17. It is 11/30/17 and I still have not received a call back. This is the 2nd time I've been treated with disrespect at AV Chevy. And from what I've been hearing from other customers, I'm not the only one.</Text>

<Review>This review is to comment on the advisor service, only.  Jennifer Sanchez is an example of what a customer service rep should be.  She went so above and beyond to help my husband and myself out with our car repair.  She even worked with Enterprise to help with our car rental fee when we couldn’t afford it (due to having to take our car back for services so soon).  She answered our calls to her office, her cell, and our texts.  If she didn’t have an answer she’d get one.  She never shrugged us off even when we brought to care back 3 times with the same problem she had them check it again every time. Even though the repair didn’t get resolved with this service center, Jennifer worked very hard to make the experience the best she could.  She’s most helpful and committed to her position. Give this girl a raise!<//Review>< UserId.>

Friendly, reliable and easy going dealership. My Husband and I have been returning customers to this dealership long before it was a Chevy Dealership in Lancaster (Customer since it was a Saturn Dealership in Palmdale).  I know alot of people from Bakersfield and Ridgecrest would make the drive to this dealership just for the service.</Text>

<text>I've had nothing but problems with my Cruze and had it in for service SO many times.  This dealer's service department is the worst.   This will be the 3rd time they've worked on one of the problems, let's see if it stays fixed for more than a week this time.   And if your service person is off for the day, they can't even tell you whether your car is ready for pickup.   Their service manager is too busy to return your call so you're stuck without a car for another day.  If you really have to buy GM junk, buy somewhere else.  But if you want a GOOD car, don't buy a Chevy.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Called about a car that was listed on Carguru. Thay said it was there and made appt. to see it. Drove 50 miles to be told that it sold the night before. They didn't seem to care much about my experance. We went to the Volkswagon dealer in Palmdale and got great service!    .... They keep calling to sell me another car. I told them that about my treatment. Not once have they even acknowledge me or the issues I had. If you use them and have real problems don't expect any help from them.</review>

AV Chevy is Amazing!!! My fiancé purchased a 2017 Chevy Malibu yesterday. Our sales rep. Leonardo Matuz was Outstanding! Not only did Leo ensure my fiancé's experience as a first time buyer was painless but he went out of his way to help us get the BEST deal possible on my fiancé's dream car!! Initially as a first time buyer with challenged credit it was seeming as though we weren't going to be able to get the Malibu and would have to instead get a Chevy Cruz but Leo worked his magic, made some suggestions to the finance manager, and made the deal possible!!! Everyone was extremely friendly and professional (customer service at its finest) but Leo was EXCEPTIONAL!! I will be coming back in about 6-8 months to trade in my Hyundai Santa Fe for a Traverse. Thank you AV Chevy and thank you Leo, see you soon ;-)< /review>

< Review>
I brought my car to be serviced here for the first time on October 12th and Service Advisor Carl Bourdon Jr., as well as the rest of the staff, was extremely friendly and helpful.  Knowing that it was my first time at this location, Carl went above and beyond what he had to do by taking the time to personally show me where the waiting area was located, offering coffee and doughnuts, and showed me where the cashier and parts departments were located.  The service time just a little over an hour, which has been very reasonable compared to some other dealerships I've been to and Carl took the time to explain all the services that were performed, any problems found during the service, and explained the brake pad and tire tread measurements.  Carl ended my visit with his exceptional professionalism and customer service by personally escorting me to where my car was parked and where it would be parked for future visits, instead of just having me find my car myself.  The staff at this location display the highest standard in professionalism and customer service, and I highly recommend this location for your vehicle service needs.< /Review>

I made an appointment online asking to be contacted by phone and was not. I made another appointment for Sat at 1pm, but when I showed up at that time was told I would not been seen that day because they were too busy. I was forced to leave the car and pay for a rental car to return home in. Sun the service dept was closed. Mon they were still not able to look at my car. Tue. someone looked at the car but parts needed to be ordered. Wed afternoon the parts arrived and I was finally able to pick up my car after waiting over an hour at 7pm. The rental car cost me an additional $150 all because my appointment time was not honored. When I go to the Dr. with an appointment I am seen at that time. I don't understand the purpose of the appointment if it isn't honored and no one is able to look at your car at that time.</Review>

<Text>I went through their sales process last year and it was dreadful... 3 days later I took home a used 2014 Corvette.  The sales person continually said they were taking a loss on selling me this vehicle and the typical sales pitch.  Come to find out they marked up the Vette by 15k and it's nearly impossible to sell at this point.  I asked their management for invoice details but they would not provide saying they took a loss and that's all I needed to know.  They sold me the car for 60k (at 11.5k mileage) only to find out it's worth 40k currently (at 15k mileage).  Sketchy sales tactics, do not recommend this dealer.  All other car sales people I know said I got butchered by this dealer.  Avoid at all costs!<//Text>< user_id>

Horrible place. It took me 1 week to schedule an appointment. No one answers the phone to schedule an appointment and anyone who does answer the phone doesn't know how to schedule an appointment. Tried to call back a week later to get a quote for my services and yet again I couldn't get ahold of a single person. Just keep getting sent to voicemail. It's bull.<//Text>

Me and the wife had a great experience with AV Chevy. We have bought several other cars from other dealerships and they all have been exhausting processes. A young man by the name of Tommy Kueper made buying our 2013 Traverse LTZ a breeze. we went in, picked out the car, settled on a price and went to dinner. Before we were done eating, Tommy called us and said the car was gassed up, washed and ready for us to take it home. Awesome service from start to end, no B.S. service department has been great too. Wife is happy and loves the car.< /text>

I called to make an appointment few days before I came in on 1/14/16. I called ahead to tell the advisor my car needed a new headlight because when it rains the headlight gets water in it. I came in for my appointment and they hadn't ordered the part, they said they had to check it out first. 4hrs later they called me and said the car needed a new headlight, which I knew and had already told them when I made the appointment. I called yesterday 1/28/16 to check on if the headlight had come in to parts yet and it had, but I hadn't received a call to make a appointment to get it installed. So I finally have appointment on 2/2/16 to have it installed.

2/14/17
I had the right side visor in my Silverado replaced after the mirror broke, the new one that was put on has grease from the mechanics on it. I didn't complain because I'm so used to not being happy with work done at this dealership. Also, my service rep Kyle smelled like cigarettes so bad the cubicle reeked of it, then when he brought my truck around my truck smelled like cigarettes. He's a nice guy, and he gets the job done but the smell is overwheling< /text>

<Review>Worst service department I have ever worked with. They lack communication, and extremely slow, and are not attentive to the word they give customers. The service department had my vehicle for nearly over a month to work on a transmission issue that wasn't present until after they performed service on my vehicle. I don't suggest buying a vehicle from or getting your vehicle serviced by this dealer.<//Review>< Pics>

Bought a 2015 Cruze in July and got scammed by the Finance Manager Paul for 3100.00 for an extended warranty and a alarm system. The factory warranty is 100,000 miles and had on star the best alarm system you can get from chevrolet. I called the owner of this company and got voice mail, it has been two days and no call back. I was told nothing of an extended warranty or alarm, he took it upon himself to charge me for it. Shame on you Paul for doing this. Money is not why I am so upset it is principal and how you did this. Most people can't afford a scam like this I can, I  am glad I purchased my 2015 Z06 somewhere else other than your dealership. I hope you and the owner enjoy your money that you have taken from myself. CUSTOMERS BEWARE DON'T GET SCAMED<//review>

The only reason why I purchased the vehicle at this dealership was because I was told that it came with green ohv stickers. I had already made arrangements at another dealership where they had the exact same vehicle and ohv stickers in hand. I was told the vehicle that I would be purchasing at AV CHEVROLET had those ohv stickers and that it was a matter of getting them from other dealership where vehicle was being  brought from. I made myself clear that this was the only reason I would be purchasing the vehicle at AV CHEVROLET. The lack of response from two different entities at this location who were supposed to contact me within the following week of purchase which was on 02/19/2017. It has been 30 days and I still have not received a phone call or a email regarding this issue. The only person who made this a pleasant purchase was Mike Martinez. I sincerely regret purchasing vehicle from this dealership, when I should have just gone to other dealership where they actually had the vehicle and ohv stickers on site. Therefore I will not be recommending AV CHEVROLET to anyone. Maybe after reading my response someone will actually contact me with a straight answer.</Text>

My service advisor was rude and seemed like he didn't want to help me, I say rude because he didn't bother to look me in the eyes when he talked to me while I've had other advisors be very friendly and the comment he left about my car being "dirty", up until I got dropped off by the shuttle and once I got the call that my vehicle was ready after an oil change I called the shuttle to pick me up and after 40 mins nothing. So I called the shuttle driver several times only to get my call ignored so I called the dealership to see what was going on and they told me I had to pick up the car by 6 or else I would have to wait till the next day in order to pick it up and that they were gonna have the shuttle driver call me back, more time went by and nothing. So finally I decided I needed to get uber To take me back to the dealership. Midway there the Av chevrolets shuttle driver calls me to pick me up by then it was almost an hour.</text>

Bought a new car within the last week, and already has a transmission problem and they refuse to either let me trade it back in, or buy it back. The staff are pushy to sell you a car and hold your drivers license and make you wait an hour so they can "make you a good deal." You cannot leave a message with the service department to solve the transmission problem because there is not an option too. I left 3 messages with the site manager "Gonzalez" over the course of the week and he has not returned my calls. What a joke-of-a-dealership. Stay away from AV Chevy and this dealership's poor customer service. Their cars are LEMONS and Lemon-heads for personnel who only care about making a sale. Reporting to BBB! I cannot believe my experience, if you are reading this comment, please, please heed my warning and go to another dealership.</Text>

<Review>I had an appt at 915, for alarm activation on my new car.  Was told when I bought the car by David that the alarm was activated the day I left.  When I went to the service dept to check in with(Tim), he said he didn't have the paperwork but he will go get it from the person who scheduled the appt.  Tim was gone for 10 minutes.  When he returned he said couldn't get the paperwork but he did come back eating a bagel and cream cheese.  The car was done and I was contacted to come pick up my vehicle and I only had to wait 10 minutes for them to drive my car up front.  The wait was short compared to other times.

Received a phone call from John Lopez service manager of Av Cheverlot.  He was very professional and the matter would be discussed with the service representative.  I appreciate the return call and will continue to use AV Chevy.<//Review>< pics>

The sales department and the service department is like day and night.  Sales would bend over backwards while service is abissmal.   I never experienced such terrible service.  I orginally quoted for a bumper repair that originally was told it would 3 days because it had to go to the body shop.  I was told to come back.  I came back and was told that it didn't need to go the body shop and that the repair was to only cost $100.00 (never heard of any body shop work that costed just $100.00).  Was told to come back.  I came back and finally got my car to what looked like the area was repaired.....from an angle.  I went to approach the bumper from the back and saw that it was scuff beyond the actual area that needed the paint.  I will never take my car there for service again.  On a lighter note.....sales you rock!< /Text>

THEY SELL LEMONS!

Been a year and nothing but headaches!!
I'm self employed  and for those who rely on their vehicles might understand this..

Not even a month into buying my 2015 Silverado rally edition and
Transmission went out! Lots good clients cause of this.. and around
$3600 for the time they had it in the shop... the told me a time frame and nothing but lies.. pass by the dealer and my truck was parked in the same spot.  Told manager and he said they just put it back bs..
April 2,2018
Took it for more bs repairs and this is the third time I take it to the shop for more problems...

Since then the truck had issues .. hard shifting, lots of freaking problems for supposedly a certified  vehicle  and the list goes on...
So today April 7,2018..
After losing around $900 bucks for not having my truck in a week...went to pick up my truck  for the third time in a year.. and they lost my keys!!..  not to mention I had a meeting with a new client that I been chasing for months and they lose my keys .. and now I lost the client for good.

I Love Chevy.. but BUYER BEWARE!!
and if u gonna buy use certified or even new vehicles from this dealer DONT!!
Few people I seen there and talked to had same issues as mine..
And sad thing there's been people trying to help but they always end up getting fired.. they should start with THE MANAGERS since they dont do jack and let the customer service reps get fire.
SO ANYONE THAT KNOWS ABOUT LEMON LAW PLEASE point me in the right direction. Since I been nothing but cool about all this till now.  maybe I should of screamed  at people to get stuff done.</Review>

I saw her leave with a another coworker and didn't tell me anything. At 4:24pm I got pissed off its hot outside and no service everyone too busy finally another lady came out and I told her I've been outside for over 30 minutes. She looked around and had to ask someone to help. He was kind and got the job done. I didn't appreciate the first lady leaving me outside waiting for someone. If you don't have the staff you shouldn't schedule the appt. I didn't get my car til 5:30 pm or later. That's the worst service I've had. Never had this problem at hunter dodge or saturn back in the day. Than the person who sold me the car told me he would help me when I needed my first service. Texted him and all I got back was a reply I'm busy with another client going to Santa Clarita right now 2 days later. Till today he still has not got back to me. Guess he still with the other client. So in other words youre no longer a client don't text me. I was thinking of buying my next vehicle there but I think I'll take my chances at another dealership. Im definitely not looking forward to my next oil change. I'm actually dreading going back. Not sure it's worth the free maintenance that comes with the car. I would give the gentleman that wrote up the paperwork a 5. The rest of the dealership zero.<//review>< rating>

I was greeted with very promt and polite service. As soon as i stepped out of my vehicle a employee was there to greet me with a smile and a positive attitude. I was only there a total of 10 minutes and everything was done on my part. They offered me something to drink and asked if i needed a ride. I didnt my wife was there picking me up in my other brand new chevy which i bought from them. We ran a couple errands and ended up back at our house when they called me to tell me my 2015 suburban that was there getting serviced + getting a recal addressed was already done. So i went back to the service department and was kindly greeted again but this time was by the service writer who was a down to earth kind man that served our country. He had everything ready for me to sign and i was on my way. Once i was in site of my vehicle i noticed it was shining. They washed it. Nice. They washed it good too. You know when you go pay someone to wash your vehicle and you look at it and the wheels are still dirt inside the spokes and there is still some petrified bug guts on the windsheild (the ones that require serious scrubbing) this was not the case. It was damn near as clean as it was when i bought it. I was super happy when i left and will be a life long customer to them. As long as chevy keeps bringing a good product which they havnt let me down yet. Anyways i highly recommend them to anyone and can promise you that every one of there staff members treat you like a family member or someone they like which isnt to common these days. I have horror stories where i damn near left other dealers in handcuffs because they pissed me off so bad..... but they are awesome!</text>

<Review>2.5 hours for an oil change really!!! And they didn't even have a courtesy shuttle available!!!!  Told if it was going to be longer than an hour they would call me... nope. 1.5hrs later I tried calling & kept getting forwarded to my service consultants voicemail.  Really!?? I wish I had another option for a Chevy dealership,  maybe I'll start going to Bakersfield.
Oh ya and BTW I bought my car there,  but I too walked around for 45min without being greeted or approached. I had to go ask the lady at the front desk for help! Wow!< /Review>< Rating>

<Text>While i was their i had great service staff was friendly offering water and what not. The salesman Joey Gonzalez said i would receive the full amount of rebates/ Discounts on my new silvarado equaling about 6200 dollars.  Well after looking over my paperwork about a month later when i received my financing i noticed they pulled a fast one on me and lied. What they did was took my four grand for a down payment and added that in my discount. They clearly told me i would receive that discount before i told them what i wanted to put down. So AV Chevy pulled the old bait and switch . I realize it is my fault for trusting them and signing the paperwork. Lamel Scott was handling my finances after i left that dealership i could never get a hold of him i have called several times and left several message no response ever. So everything is all good here until you purchase your vehicle and leave make sure they don't tell you that you will get so and so off when really its a smaller amount plus your down payment. Again i was told i would recieve 6200 off but in reality i got 2200 off and they got me for 4 thousand dollars and i never knew who financed me until i receive  a payment noticed from that bank. JUST BE CAREFULL!!!!!!</Text><Name>Michael Ramirez</Name><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Steve hung up on phone. Denied 3 times problem was chevy until I gave him the codes from my dealer back home in Ohio who gave them to me in 2 minutes on the phone.  Did not know alignment specs were by the conversion van company and the chevy specs would have ruined my front end.  Other service writer twice criticized a mechanic in front of several customers-no faith in mechanic either then.  Set off burglary alarm 7 times and twice I called to help them turn it off properly, finally I turned it off from my cell phone just for their sake.  Rude, unprofessional, unknowledgeable about product, finally calmed down when I asked to contact the chevy zone manager-which he refused of course.  Both afternoons he promised to start looking at the items needing attention and did neither time as I knew from my cell phone app when the doors were opened and locked.  I asked for two things, he did neither and did 3 things I did not ask for.  At least he realized he did nothing to charge me for and I lost 36 hours of my vacation.< /Text>

Waited for 30 minutes to get a car checked in for service.  This was with an appointment.   The individual we had the appointment with ignored us.   How long does it take to click a few icons on a screen and entire a number for an oil change.< /Review>

<text>I arrived at AVC and was immediately greeted by Tania Martinez. She was very friendly and easy to get along with. I told her what it was that I was looking for. She immediately took me to the vehicle that I was interested in. I told her I liked it, but It was not the color that I wanted. She said "No Problem, I will get you the car in the color you want."  I was really impressed by her knowledge of all the vehicles that Chevy carries. When I went to Finance I had the great pleasure of speaking to Nina Garcia. This girl is amazing! I let her know what payment and finance rate I was looking for and she assured my that she would get me the rate I was looking for or as close as possible. Let me tell you she did just that. When the time came to finalize the paperwork I was greeted by Lamel Scott. I was equally impressed by his professionalism and knowledge. He explained everything to me and answered all of my questions. When I inspected the vehicle, it was just as I expected. Pedro did a great job cleaning and detailing it for me. All I can say is that from the moment I got to AVC and then to The Purchase of My 2014 Chevy Equinox, Tania Martinez, Nina Garcia, Lamel Scott and Pedro made my experience at AVC a wonderful and stress free experience. Thank You to All of you for getting me the car that I wanted and for making it an extremely stress fee experience. I will definitely refer all of my Family and Friends to Tania, Nina, Lamel and Pedro. Keep up the great work.</text><Time>1402253420883< /Time><name>Faviola Pizarro< /name><user_id>107698319192509792930<//user_id>< Pictures>

im a new customer of av Chevy and i will not be a return customer joey the scam artist and justin the older brother scam artist. they both are the owner of the dealership if you see good reviews those are all lies.  this is the worst company ever justin is the older brother and he is the biggest scam artist i know and he taught his younger brother how to scam people also.  I REPEAT DONT EVA EVA EVA BUY A CAR FROM AV CHEVY DONT CARE HOW LOW THE INTEREST RATE BECAUSE IN LONG TERM YOU WILL BE PAYING MORE OUT YOUR POCKET they have so many complaints they some customers are scared to report av chevy because they got scam also. but i learned a lesson if the sons of a dealership will sell you a bad car you know you cant trust them. customer think twice before doing business with them. if know a dealership is bad when they change names from saturn dealership  to av chevy . somebody needed a bailout so now they sell used and bad car.<//text>

We where towed in overheaded.  Next morning they called in the morning and told us the it would be $5K - $7K to replace a blown engine.  I knew better but we where over 250 miles from home in Arizona.  So I not knowing the area, since first time to the area.  So where do you go when in a large town and not knowing who to trust to work on the car we went to AV Chevy since it is an Astro Van, makes since.  But in stead we had to have the car towed back home at a cost of $1140.00, to get the proper repair needed to get  us back on the road.  Terrible thing is that we trusted CHEVY and that was a big mistake, as it only cost  $175.00 to fix the problem, Heater intake hose.
We even talked with General Motors about the treatment we recieved at one of thier dealers and all we gaot was rude comments and told us to buy a new car, no help from them at all.  Will never buy another General Motors Vehicle again.  NEVER.</Text>

<time>1331404857338< /time><rating>1</rating><text>Horrible service. The 1st time I took it they lost my car for a day, then the issue with the EGR valve took almost a week to fix and was going to be super expensive upper $400 with labor, they couldnt locate my warranty so i had to provide proof I had a warranty, and once I faxed it over- my car was magically ready.
The people are very friendly and I love Chevy so last week when another issue came up with my car, I called to make an appointment so that way they could order the part and i could drop off my car once it was in. I called today to confirm and they again couldnt even find my appointment but said they could squeeze me in and try to get to it today. No thank you, I'm not even trying to go throught that again-and I will never take my car here again! I'll stick with Rally chev. in palmdale even though they are out of my way, the service is prompt and professional.</text>< Pictures>

Dont wait for an oil change! Take the shuttle home, because I have been here for two hours and still waiting with an appointment!!! Kinda defeats the point of an appointment when you see you truck sitting there for the first hour and forty five minutes!!!<//review>
