The service was great when they help you out but i saw 2 customers leave because of the wait times.  A customer had to ask a associate if they had a iPhone she was looking for in stock to not waste time being there but she ended up leaving.<//text>

This T-mobile store has poor customer service. I called to ask if they had a certain phone. The guy Andrew spoke with him on the phone he said the have the phone that I want it and I ask if I can make an appointment and he said just come in. He failed to tell me that there was a 45 minute wait and they were taking people in front of me that is already have an appointment after 1 hour asking him how much longer he said I still have 2 people in front of you. Andrew being a store manager should have better costumer service. I would not recommend this store. Store at Otay Lakes Road.</Text>

< Review>
I went and bought a new phone and spent $750. The hour I waited for my turn was fine, but when I got my phone it took them 1 hour and 10 minutes to setup. Ridiculous! When I asked if they can at least hook me up with a case for the inconvenience, the manager Noe showed me cases that "were on sale" for $20. I looked at the price and it was $19.99 and I said how are they on sale when it says $19.99. He said well its cheaper then the other ones. I said can you give me a deal on the case and he said no.... first and last time I'm going to that store.  Very poor customer service.</Review>

<username>Horacio Correa Jr< /username><Review>Really bad experience today. My iPad was damaged and I thought I still had appIe care. After wasting 40 minutes on the phone with T-Mobile support, I was told to go to this store. I asked for their assistance because I was not informed my Apple care plan would be removed if I cancel the line. The manager didn’t offer any solutions and was completely unhelpful. He said it wasn’t their fault, they didn’t have anything to do with it and that I should have noticed the change in my bill. They’re happy to up sell you but failed miserably with basic customer service. Nothing “uncarrier”, more overhyped than anything.< /Review><response>{'time': 1582566435895, 'text': "I am sorry to hear this Horacio, that's not the experience we want for our customers.

I came in to solve a confusing issue with my social security number, and having to visit the store twice in one week. I was helped by Karla, and she was the best person that I have ever been helped by. Knowing my issue, she kept trying to think of ways to solve it and how it happened. She did not quit once. Knowing some people, some might've just gave up instantaneously, but she kept going. She really made my visit worth it, as she solved the issue and any concerns that I had. After I left I was super happy that she was the one that helped me out, and we were able to come to a solution. She is the best, and is super kind and respectful to the customers. THANK YOU AGAIN KARLA FOR EVERYTHING!!!!!<//Text>

<Text>Overall.... they have great customer service.

The first time I switched to T-Mobile, I was very upset with the representative that helped me out. I was charged a bunch of extras items that I did not sign up for. I called T-Mobile's Customer Service line and they were able to remove the extra fees and services. Besides that one experience, everything else has been great. I switched my mom onto my account and I will be switching my dad very soon.

Thanks T-Mobile!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Went in there to ask 2 questions.  One about international travel and one about a payment.  They told us to wait.  One employee just stood at the counter the other 3 were with customers.  One employee finished with his customer and walked into the back room where we saw 3 other employees.  We waited 10 minutes and left.  We will just call in our questions so.  Lousy customer service. I don't complain much but I had to on this case.< /Review>

Best liars...!!   I witch from at&t to tmobile with the promise that they would pay off my termination fees. They also said I would pay certain amount a month.  Turns out that I'm paying $100 a month.  I should have stayed with At&t.  They are the best..!   After 3 months I received a letter saying that they would not reimburse me the $745 to pay off at&t.   I don't believe in them and after numerous calls for help on this matter.  No one has gotten back to me.  I will never shop and I'm switching to another company.<//Text>

Switched recently from AT&T.  The coverage isn't quite as good, but the customer service is superb, especially at this location!  We've been in here a couple times and they are always super helpful.</Text>

<text>Came in the store looking to purchase a onelpus 6t. I went to try out the display model which someone had put a pattern lock on. When I told the store member he tried to reset it and then tells me "I can get in and I think we're all out" I felt as though I was brushed off because I never said I was looking to purchase one. Which I was. Bad experience<//text><Name>Terron Franklin<//Name><time>1541708548525< /time></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Horrible bad customer service, to sell they are super friendly but to help resolve and help the customer forget. KEVIN The manager is protected by saying so and there is nothing else to do. Definitely change company. Asap !!!!
They don't deserve a star.

Horrible mal servicio al cliente,para vender son super amables pero para audar de resolver y ayudar al cliente olvidense. KEVIN El encargado se amparan diciendo asi es y no ahi nada mas que hacer. Definitivamente cambiar de compania. Asap!!!!

I like this restaurant! They offer marvelous meals, their menu is nice, The chef in that place is very trained, I like a lot eating all their dishes. The dishes are always fresh, the attitude towards the customers  is helpful. I often eat in this restaurant and I was never disappointed. I recommend it to all my friends.</Text>

We had a delicious dinner here tonight! A chili dog and an ice cold 805. Service was very friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed. Very nice! We recommend it and we will be back!  Thanks Nichols!< /review>

<Text>I only gave it a one star because there is no zero.
I had a calzone, and it was absolutely disgusting. It was supposed to have feta cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and bell peppers, as well as white sauce. Instead, it came with red sauce, huge chunks of garlic, and an excessive amount of olives. The bottom was soggy and uncooked. I tried to eat some, but it was almost inedible. Gordon Ramsay would have died, had he seen the monstrosity.
I would strongly discourage anyone from coming here, as it was a terrible experience.< /Text>< Resp>

We have been going to Nichols for years and absolutely love their food.  In particular, their Veggie Osos pizza with the white sauce is amazing, and their Rock Burger is one of the best hamburgers on the Central Coast!  Great food and fun atmosphere!</Text>

The veggie sandwich is over 10$ and consists of cold white sandwich bread with no cheese.  Technically it was as advertised, but I was expecting something a bit more impressive for 10$ and a 30 minute wait.  I hope the pizza is better, but avoid the sandwiches.<//text>

I like this place! First time going here and I have to say, their doh had the perfect flavor & texture as well unlike most garlic butter basters out there! Came on a "Bingo Night" so it was entertaining and delicious! -TheB4G3L ...P.S- Google Andrew Yang</Review>

<text>I ordered the full- size Meatball sandwich with fries and I received the absolutely best tasting Meatball sandwich that I have had to date. A very hearty tasting and fresh roll with a slight toast to it complemented the large meatballs with a wonderful tasting sauce. Great service and atmosphere and a classic rock music in the background will make Nichols Pizza a frequent stop for me in Los Osos!</text>< time>

My husband and I found this place just 8 minutes from our hotel, when we were starving and we are so glad we did. The food was amazing. Our waitress understood our need for a TON of ranch. They had a decent beer selection too. If only we didn't live so far away, I could see us becoming regulars here. (Also, the mozzarella sticks were the best I've ever had.)</Text>

< Review>
Full disclosure, I work here. That said hands down the best burgers and pizza in town. Some of my favorites from the grill are the Rock burger, chicken bacon ranch sandwich, chicken fingers or the Beyond burger if you are of the meatless persuasion.  As for the pizza you cant go wrong with the Surfers Friend or the Local or the try the Hazard Canyon (get red sauce)if you like it hot. Nowhere will you find a better Gluten-free pizza. Period. Make sure to hit us up on Tuesday for 2 for 1 medium pizzas!<//Review>

Nichols is my go to spot as a local in Los Osos. They have a menu that has just the right amount of variety without overdoing it. The ingredients are fresh and you can tell when you taste it. Nothing is even questionable - it is all amazing. The best part is the service I have received. The folks at Nichols are extremely friendly and they take care of you which is nice to see these days. Also have a bunch of TV's for football Sunday. Overall, easy 5/5 stars and I will be returning until I move away from this area!<//Text>

<text>The food is great, great little arcade for the kids, sports on every TV, great beer selection, and outdoor seating.  We frequent Nichols because they have great beer specials and a great menu.  Their pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, appetizers are all good.  Haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but there hasn't been one thing we don't like.  The "nachos" are one of my favorites snacks.  The staff is all great and more often than not the owners are there and are really nice people.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Love this place. Today I tried the burger (the American burger combo). I have to say it was the best burger I’ve had in a long time. Much better than the popular burger spot here in town, and a better value too!  The meat was seasoned perfectly, the bun was soft, fresh, and delicious, and the burger sauce was so good I dipped my fries in what fell from the burger.  They also have pizza, calzone, sandwiches, and a super selection of beers! If you’re in Los Osos and hungry, try it. I think you’ll be really happy.  Also. The music they play is really good; a great casual dining experience.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I’m sorry you were disappointed with your service at our restaurant. Your server did comp 100% of your drinks as an apology for your delay. Your order got behind the other tables because a family member at your table wasn’t ready to order and the other tables got theirs in ahead of yours. Your order was plated and ready to table 21 minutes after it was placed- just as you were walking out the door. Your ticket was printed here 45 minutes before your review was posted. I too have eaten at Cool Cats and know how long it takes to drive there as well as get served. I’m certain we could have provided better customer service for you here today. You have my apology for that. Hopefully your family will try us again the next time your on a hike out here and we can do a better job for you. Our food is hand made and we don’t own a microwave so it takes a little longer than the normal restaurant but I think the wait is worth it. Again, I am very sorry we disappointed you today.

<time>1546701234584</time><rate>5< /rate><text>We ate here for dinner one evening during our camping trip at Montana de Oro. There were 10 of us total. The pizza dough was perfect for my tastes. It was a little crispy outside and chewy inside. We had 4 pizzas, most of which were customized in some way. First time I have seen pineapple on a combination pizza, so I picked it off. The woman who waited on us was very nice, great service Skyler. She gave us feedback about the pizzas and the drinks we ordered. She was very good about keeping our drinks full too. The root beer they have on tap is pretty good. The chicken pizza we ordered was my least favorite, it just seemed to not have as much flavor as the others. The combination pizza was my favorite, after removing the pineapple of course. Would definitely come back here. They have some custom beers and other items on the menu that I might try if anyone can talk me out of ordering the pizza again.
We had ordered the combo without pineapple, but they forgot to remove it. Skyler offered to remake the pizza, we opted to just pick it off. She ended up giving us a discount on the pizza and drinks we had. Which, in all honesty, wasn't necessary. She definitely turned what could have been a 3 star great pizza, bad service into this 5 star review.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

No matter how you ask, they won't cook your burger well or medium rare. Everyone gets medium well. The pasta is good at least. The servers never ask if you'd like dessert but usually they are nice. Overall this place is a little expensive for what you get but there aren't a lot of options in Los Osos.</text>

{'time': 1433777583422, 'text': 'Hello Marc, I am glad you like our food. Our menu is available as a PDF on Facebook. No building an order required. You don\'t have to "build" an order on our web order site to see the prices either. Although you do have to make it think you are interested in ordering. Just click take out. All of the prices will show up. I am sorry but there is no way to change that. It is inherent to the software which is a platform that Round Table, Me & Ed\'s and a host of other regional chains use. Although it is not the way I would design it to operate, in this case there is not a lot which can be done about it. Again, full  menu no requirements available online via facebook.com/nicholspizza. Thank you for the 4 stars and we are very please that you like our food :)'}<//Resp>
<Review>Food is great but looking up the menu online is not so great.  Prices are only available online if you build an order and give all your personal information.  Would love to be able to see a full menu online.< /Review><name>Marc Mayes<//name>< Gmap_id>

Environment was too loud. Maybe it can't be controlled. Had the boneless wings that tasted like they've been frozen, had an odd flavor. Fries were good and also the calzón was good, but just way too loud and pricey. Couldn't even have a conversation, or hear myself for that matter.</Review>

Great homemade pizza crust and generous toppings.   Visit Tuesday nights and you can get 12in 2 for 1 pizzas.  Wish I lived in this town because I would make this a regular stop.< /text>

This restaurant has good pizzas and sandwiches. They also have a bar and many televisions in there if you happen to like sports.  I personally am not into sports so cannot rate it from that aspect.</Text>

< Review>
I don't believe half of the reviews that I seen here understand what rating a restaurant and its quality is about. This is a bar and grill and it's not a gourmet restaurant. And to be honest I absolutely do not believe the review by Crystal to be true at all there is no reason for that post not to be removed because it's absolutely fake the person is clearly an sjw bent on trying to be offended at something so that she can get credit as an sjw. I am actually going to go down there right now and will update this review afterwards.< /Review>

This place is no doubt one of the most pleasant place in the area. Every time I come to this place I am absolutely satisfied. They preserve their very high  standard service and the highest level of dishes  they give. You no doubt will love this place. Warmly  recommended.< /Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I stopped coming here because in the past the employees were really stingy with the veggies. I stopped by the other day after 3 years of going there and long story short... They're still stingy with their vegetables. 3 cut slices of onion spread out on a footlong and 4 slices of bell pepper on the footlong.<//Review><date>1614893434175<//date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Ya~knO" this 1- Subway would be alot better if some of their workers wouldn't be so rude to my spouse I've sent him there several times and he said not all workers are rude but 1-2" female's ..he said he won't go baCk there for me No More ..service w/ a smile is best even if they get on ur nerves or having a bad day please it opens up the Spirit instead of shutting it down.. I love Subway but guess no more for mE".. hope you change some good luck!<//Review><user_id>110350325274253737204<//user_id><user_name>Davina Perez< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

You cannot try clothes on and they refuse to take clothes back. Now I have $160 worth of clothes that cannot be returned. This place is a joke and I'll never spend a penny here again.<//review>

<Text>We will not return to this store when we can go down the street and buy the same thing and be treated with respect when we walk in the door.  You can no longer try on clothes, use their dressing rooms, return items or do exchanges.  My son was making sure a shirt would fit by slipping it over his shirt and we were lectured for doing so.  I know that this COVID thing is serious but come on---------how do you expect to sell if a customer cannot be sure of what he is buying and then if not satisfied, he cannot return for refund or exchange.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Went in to buy some work clothes and they said I couldn’t use the dressing rooms. So I went with the size I thought would work and when I got home a tried on the pants they were too big. I called and asked if I could exchange them and they had told me no all sales are finale. So your gonna not have dressing rooms to try the clothes on and not tell people there are no exchanges?! Ridiculous. I went over to dickies t shirt warehouse after that and they had fitting rooms and take exchanges. Would definetly recommend them instead and it’s right down the street.</Text>

Well, this is a diamond in the rough.  Street one is nestled in among a wild bird store, an automotive detail shop, but if you're looking for good pricing, huge selection, and an easy going "Howdy" atmosphere, this one's for you. Dickies, Carhartt, Levis, Ben Davis, Pro Club, just to name a few. I took a star away due to what I perceive as an unreasonable return policy. The policy is very simple however....NO. No refunds No exchanges, No. But if you don't like the crowded mega store atmosphere, and you don't mind digging deep to find your size,( It's sort of a warehouse flavor) then Street One will be a perfect fit.<//Review>

When they didn't have a certain kind of pants that always worked for him, they suggested another brand. Come to find out they fit him better then what he normally wears and were super comfortable!

Good spot to get work style clothes like Dickie's, Ben Davis, Carhart, etc. But, they gotta order more inventory in the more common sizes. I kept finding shirts I liked and when I'd go through the sizes it would go... M, 3XL, 4XL, and sometimes even 5XL.  Allmost all of the L, XL, and XXL sizes were sold out.  I found about a dozen shirts I liked. Of those, I would have bought at least 3, but only 1 was available in my size so that's all I got.</Review>

Great selection, good prices and quality. Knocked off one star for the lack of AC in the store, which made the store as hot and muggy as outside. The dressing room was especially stuffy, which made for a less than optimal experience.< /Text>

They sell reasonably priced Dickies work pants, overalls, and belts and some accessories. They also carry what Dickies refers to as big and tall sizes. They even sell women and children's clothing along with scrubs.<//Text>

About prices,  are not so bad,  but it's more like warehouse clothes selling.
In fact you can find a big bunch of sizes on dickies brand.</review>

I bought a jacket from this company the zipper broke within 2 days they refused to work with me on anything I even offered to buy another one at discounted price and they said they couldn't, absolutely horrible customer service I guess I'll just keep buying from Amazon at least I can return something if there is a problem.< /Review>

This place has a huge selection of Dickies brand clothing, however the clothes don't seem to be arranged by sizing or color, so be prepared to dig a little for your size.< /Text>

<review>Completed the HERS Testing required by Alameda County when installing new HVAC equipment.  Arrived on time and walked me thru the testing procedure.  Work with the installation contractor to complete the test in a timely manner.  Due to COVID, wore mask and maintained social distancing whenever possible.  Great to work with.<//review>< Pictures>

I appreciate the safety precautions the store is taking, they are one of the only stores still sanitizing the pinpads.  I come here about once a week.  State mandated capacity restraints did cause long lines around Christmas, but I haven't waited more than 5 minutes (if that) to get in since January (like I said I shop at least once a week) and the line is moving much quicker now that the state is allowing them to let more people in.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and I like that sometimes they can get the store open a little early in the mornings.<//Text>

<text>Went on Annual Candle Day and was pleasently surprised with how organized and orderly the store was. All the associates were very nice and helpful. They let people in in waves to keep the store uncrowded. It felt like Black Friday without the stress and rush of the crowd. Well done management team of this Bath and Body Works. Bought 15 candles at $7.60 a each.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCQVi00XBSmxTH7d42EUlmSHzO7zUBG0cAlRoz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0vZSm-tgp-v__wDFJ84FZVEzkykNKn3xOiFzK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><gmapID>0x80dcab2f44c578ab:0x3edf1ece1f036be5</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Finally were able to get in and shop, this store stayed popular through this whole pandemic with lines going way far back. Love their products and over bought, so glad there's one closer than Inland Center.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>This location is in an outdoor mall so has been getting extra merchandise while indoor malls have been closed. This store extended the semi annual summer sale because of that and I was able to get summer scents I liked at great prices while looking at new fall scents. They have set aside one hour a week for early shopping for more vulnerable shoppers. Check the store hours for more information. Weekday mornings have less shoppers. It is a small shop but set up well for getting around inside. I noticed it started to get kind of full closer to noon. Advise going early. Asked how to smell the scents and was told that it will be okay to quickly pull down face mask just to nose and then put back up. Touching the scent will fingers is strictly not allowed, nor touching caps with fingers or nose. I would advise not shopping in person if you are not comfortable with others smelling scents. Opt to order on line. I checked and the return policy is still in effect and you do have the option to return in store in ordering on line. I really need to be able to smell the scents to decide so I went ahead with pulling the mask down from nose, but didn't feel right or good about it. I limited myself to three scents to choose from and went away from other shoppers to smell them. I bought two of them.  Employees are all wearing masks. Distancing markers are at the registers. Plexiglass at the counter. There are limits to how many customers allowed in the store at one time and I have seen lines outside. The lines may get longer during the holiday season. Again, going early in the day is key.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Products are fine,  once again rewards don't seem to be there when you go to use them.  I wonder if they ever are there for as much money as I spend I can never redeem them.</Text>

We have been trying to get into this place for a couple months but due to the covid-19 it's difficult because everybody wants to shop there. We were finally able to get in last night my daughter and two grandkids little bit before closing time. The manager was awesome and let us come in before she lock the doors and we're able to purchase what we needed to. Great selection great prices. Thank you< /review>

<Review>I am so glad that we have this location in Redlands instead of driving to San Bernardino. The only downside is the long lines outside due to COVID-19. Everyone in this location are very kind, friendly and helpful. Always kept clean and staff is always helping customers.</Review>< Pics>

The manager was incredibly rude in telling me the time they actually open and that they hadn’t updated the times on the phone. Seems pretty important for a very crowded store to do when there are people who are trying to avoid the current risk.< /text>< Pics>

I absolutely love the bath gels. There was no way I was going to stand in a 2-hour line. I was able to get in with senior shopping. The prices have gone up, $8 for five hand sanitizers. Their 75% off sale ,is definitely not what it used to be. I buy enough bath gels , so I only have to buy two times a year. It seems like the same old scents, different names! I will always get my bath gels there.</Review>

<review>When you call the store, the message says " this store is open! our hours are 11 to 7 p.m. daily! however, don't be fooled into thinking that if you arrive during business hours that they will let you in the store. We drove 30 minutes to get to this store, just to have the kid that worked there say " I'm sorry, we aren't letting anyone else in". I arrived at 6:45 p.m. I asked to speak with the manager, and strongly suggested they change their recorded message, so people won't drive a long distance thinking they will be allowed to shop in the store, even if we arrive during the open business hours. This is BAD business!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Long lines. I have been outside and there was not that long. It has been an hr and nothing. I still have 6 people ahead of me. They only letting in 8 at a time. The San Bernandino mall at least give you a time frame to shop. Bath and Body Works is ridiculous! I'm not shopping during Covid no more. Not worth my time .</review>

<Text>Friendly and helpful staff. The store is never messy, always clean and everything is placed so nicely. There is always a great sale or coupon, so I can get my goodies for less. I love the candles that they sell. The candles are very fragrant, and last long.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Great! We had a wonderful person helping my daughter and I. She asked if we had the Mobil App and I didn't and she explained it.  Definitely sign up! Lots of great freebies! We even got to take advantage of its current great offer. Check it out! Wonderful to have a friendly and helpful person in a store these days.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcab2f44c578ab:0x3edf1ece1f036be5< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>I had to wait outside for about 10-15 minutes. I think that prices have gone up. There weren't any real goodies on sale, so that sucked. I was looking for sale plug ins, but there weren't any. Bottle hand sanitizer was sold out. Only the lil purse size were available.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Best experience I have ever had at a Bath and Body Works store. I was immediately greeted with a basket, asked if I needed help locating anything, brought ti a sink to try different soaps, and when checking out, told very kindly how to get a 20% coupon easily. The store was super clean and looked adorablely put together. The staff was incredibly friendly. I can't wait to go back for refills!<//text>< user_id>

I'm so happy to finally have a bath & body works close to me. The shop is surprisingly larger than I thought it was initially but I was pleasantly surprised. They have sink stations to test soaps, strips of paper to try fragrances, and candles/scents for the house. They tend to keep both doors open so there's plenty of fresh air so as not to have it overwhelming with powerful scents.<//review>

<review>I always smelt this store passing by to go to work, and never really needed anything from here except when time came to buy my friend a gift for his bday. He likes BABW but I only knew he always had their lotions. So I went in and was immediately greeted by one of the workers. Luckily I was the only customer and he helped me pick out something cool and different for my friend that I knew he'd like! My friend is an Abercrombie and Fitch lover as well... and they had a candle that smelled EXACTLY like the Fierce cologne from A&F. Not only did I buy  him a present but I also got myself the same candle! I lit it at home immediately and man ... it is fragranced! I love it! I definitely have been sleeping on those candles< /review>< Response>

This Bath & Body Works is okay, but not as good as the one in Fontana.  Employees are not as helpful as they can be. I needed to find something and the employee stocking acted like she was too busy to help.</review>

Came here based on a recommendation and could not be happier. Called in a large family order at the last minute on a Sunday afternoon. Not only was the order fulfilled quickly and exactly how I requested, the food was fresh and seasoned perfectly. Will definitely be back for more!</text>

Good Concept, Decent Food
We had lunch at the La Canada branch of this fresh Mediterranean fast casual concept. Although somewhat Americanized, the ingredients were fresh and the food was fine. After ordering at the counter, the food is brought to your table as it is made (not necessarily all at once). The main difference between this place and more traditional places serving similar food is that Luna Grill is more expensive and has less bold flavors. The casual vibe was good for the kids and the staff was friendly and helpful.</review>

This place is so good! I love the Santorini
chicken bowl - it’s literally a bowl of all my favorite things, and each item is made perfectly! I also really love their falafel and tahini. I’ve been ordering take out and nowhere else comes close to their quality and the value. It’s seriously so good!< /review>

I've been here several times. The food is always fresh and the service is great. My favorite is the flat cut chicken kabob with basmati rice. I get hummus and pita bread as my sides. You can buy an add'l 6 pieces of pita for $1 - totally worth it. They also have fresh brewed iced tea. I highly recommend this restaurant.</Text>

Had a Market chicken wrap and also a Mediterranean salad with chicken. The place is very new. There's a Baked Bear build your own cookie ice cream sandwich franchise next door.

The workers were friendly. The cashier was helpful and another worker helped get me a free chipotle cream sauce on the side.

The chicken was tasty and not dry, but I wish there was a little more chicken in the $10 salad. The food was good but it's tough bc there's so much good Persian Armenian food in Glendale, La Crescenta, Atwater, Burbank, and other nearby areas.< /Text>

Gosh the food is good here! I can take my 17-year-old son, who can be picky, and he'll always find something to his liking. It's healthy, fresh, and delicious. The staff are young and bubbly. PLUS they have good alternatives to soda drinks, pomegranate limeade and lemonade. Reasonable prices, too. Sometimes the only problem is finding a parking spot!< /review>

I gave this place a second try,the food is just average. To many better Mediterranean restaurants in my opinion. If in the area I would go again. On the other hand the service is on spot! Adrian is a great customer service employee.< /Text>

<text>I thought the inside of the restaurant was well-designed, clean, and modern.

Although I have only eaten here once I thought the food was very good. I had the ground beef kabob and it was excellent. Hummus was just as good as the one I make at home. The yogurt dip was just as good. I would definitely recommend it to others.  Btw, the inside decor is interesting and so was the bathrooms. I gave it 4 stars because 5 would have to be exceptional.</Review>

One person in front of us in line, and it was at least 10 minutes to get through. Now we are watching as they sloooowly deliver food to people sitting around the dining areas. Boyfriend’s plate just came. Waiting for mine. Yes, that’s how they delivered to other tables too...

Ok, so the food was pretty good, but I don’t think I would come here again (hungry—as usually am when I go out for food) and wait to get it.

We were just trying to grab a bite before heading up into the mountains.  Turned into quite a stopover.

<text>Food is good but most disorganized place i have ever seen. Almost every order out of 7 orders was made wrong and some of them twice. Part of the order was also missing completely. Maybe it was our bad luck, but we wated so much time going back and forth that it was too frustrating to ignore.<//text>< Pics>

Went last week, had chicken kabob.  Nice plate but the house dressing tastes odd.  Good place to get clean food.  I don't like rice but it seems you always get it.  Parking is easy, shares a mini mall with several other restaurants and a Home Goods.</Text>

I went with a coworker for lunch. The food was fresh and delicious, and the place was cozy. There is an outdoor patio, and they even decorated for Halloween! My salad was of medium size, which was perfect, and you can ask for dressing on the side. Service was great as everyone was friendly.< /Text>

Very small location, food has almost no sauce inside, wrappings poor in meat and the place is pricey, you get only ONE napkin!
The food was awful. Not recommended at all!< /Review>

Okay good but it's not worth the money for what little food you get. Stay away from beef or meats here. Just get chicken kebab, the regular one. The thin cut chicken is not good since they burn them.</Review>

Autmosphere is nice they have a beautiful seating outside which I like it the most.
Food is good not great cause Mediterranean food is our specialty so I know which one is good which one is great but I still recommend this place as a Mediterranean nice restaurant.
Bevarage wise they have BEER and that is awsome.<//review>< user_name>

Was OK. Would prefer that they didn't skimp on the falafel and also not cut them in half. I feel as though they cut the falafel in half so it seems as if you're getting more. They could also add more vegan options to the menu. Reminded me of a say Panera bread Mediterranean style. I got the falafel wrap which was wraped in lettuce because there was no vegan wrap option. Comes with french fries and tahini sauce which was good but such a small sized sauce I had to ask for another. Large amount of fries that the bf helped me eat. He got the beat bowl which again the falafel was skimped on.<//review>

Chicken is very tasty.  I ordered a seasonal beet salad and added chicken. This is an order at the counter before being seated casual place.  Indo find their combinations a bit odd.  My salad had roasted tomatoes but fairly pedestrian  beets that could have come out of a can, which I love but I guess was expecting something a bit more elevated.  They serve hummus which I am not a big  fan of and do not serve baba ganoush/mouttabal (which I love!).   I tasted my lunch partner's.  It had a strange sweetness and was not that thick.  I realise there are many different cultures represented in Middle-Eastern cooking. Having never eaten at a Halal establishment and my expectations being based on my 50 or so years of  eating Israeli, Persian, Lebanese, and Armenian food probably coloured my perception but all-in-all food was fresh and tasty.  This is a good casual dining option in LA Canada.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Like a gourmet Habib's (Brazilian Middle Eastern fast food chain) that serves healthy food, but infinitely better than Habib's. But it does not remind Habib's why it is esfiha, but because it is a Middle Eastern food franchise, with several addresses in California and some in Texas.

Everything is very tasty, it is nothing out of this world, but it is a good, quick and affordable option, with Several dishes common to us Brazilians, such as falafel, hummus, tabules, very generous salads and the dishes combined, also very well served.

Tipo um Habib's gourmet que serve comida saudável, mas infinitamente melhor que um Habib's. Mas não lembra o Habib's por que tem esfiha e sim porque é uma franquia de comida do oriente médio, com vários endereços na Califórnia e alguns no Texa.

Tudo é bem gostoso, não é nada de outro mundo, mas é uma boa opção rápida e acessível, com vários pratos comuns à nós brasileiros, como charutos, falafel, hummus, tabules, saladas bem generosas e os pratos combinados, também muito bem servidos, sem miséria.</text>

Debbie is always friendly and welcoming. You can enjoy your time inside with shooting pool and music from the jukebox. Outside there are 2 fire pits to sit and enjoy your drinks with a warm fire.< /Review>

<Text>I haven't been here since the pandemic started but when I went I loved it. It is kind of a hole in the wall kind of bar but I loved the atmosphere and the bartender was great as well. If I drank more I would be there all of the time. I checked to see if they are still open or had to close down and am very happy they haven't closed down. I hate to see great businesses having to close down.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>I asked bartender for a Paloma and the bartender told me, to let her know what’s in it and she will make it, she was missing her front tooth. She was rude just because I was litty and happy. My friend got us margaritas just to make it easy on the prudish bartender. Once, we got outside there was underwear on floor and bouncer didn’t care. I had my drink(worst drink ever) and that’s it, never coming back lol unless I feel like being trash for the day and then I’ll go in... (maybe)< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNctM_LOeIAfHywdlRsi-rKTN9GEJCsvZMOTGL6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvVDoelBhKi0CoZo8j1W4VID5WV0LAKB6kFNXm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Good environment, good prices. Pool tables and firepit.
Local bar feel. Generally friendly and hospitable.
No credit cards, not a drawback in this case.
Pay as you go, and I'll go back.</Review>

<Review>Its not the friendliest bar to someone that is not a regular customer. The big thing for me is wash your hands before you make my food. They have a good looking burger, but I am not eating it when they do not know health laws of handling food.<//Review><Time>1560176323211</Time><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Name>

<review>Worst bar in Oceanside. Went in to have a beer or two. While we were there, I thought I would have a Hamburger as I just watched the bartender throw a huge Hamburger patty on the grill. then I stopped, just as I was raising my hand to get her attention. I watched the Bartender stick her thumbs inside her dress and pull the top up. She was wearing a white dress and the top was strapless and made out of the same material that girls tube tops are made out of. We have all seen a lady stick her thumbs inside her top and pull it up. But not 10 times while she is grabbing Hamburger buns with the same hands. Hands on the onion, thumbs back in the top, bend over to grab the tomato, Hands in the top, again pulling it up. Reach for the lettuce. Hands in her top. Stop to make drinks. (4). Handle money, make change. Return the change. Pull up the top. Go pick up a bun and start putting a hamburger fixings together. Bend over and pick up the cheese. Pull top up.
I don't want my wife to rub her hands on her body while cooking my food, let alone some bartender. Now I am watching. Not once does she wash her hands. I left.< /review><Response>None</Response>< user_name>

<review>Do not pass go. Do not eat or drink here. This has to be the bottom of the barrel even for Oceanside. If your a washed out drunk that is hammered 🔨 by 10 am, this is your bar. If the lady you sometimes date is also your cousin, this is your bar. If your idea of a good time is watching the 60 year old female bartender out side sucking on a cigarette while you walked in and sat down waiting to be served, then she walked up and said what do you want (Not washing her hands after having them at her mouth) this is your bar. If you looked at the review and was not shocker,, this is your bar</review>< Pics>

Female bartender younger girl always has a nasty cold sore on her mouth.  We left because I couldn't stand the fact she was serving drinks with this thing. Not washing hands, at one point I saw her rub/wipe it then grab a glass and squeeze a lime all with the same hand she just wiped her cold sore with.   We left immediately and will not come in if she is working.  Been going here for years and years. From drunk bartenders to people behind the bar who dont work there but this is by far the worst.< /review>

<Text>love it...…….small  pitchers of domestic beer, $3.50 for happy hour and $4.25 to $4.50 Non Happy Hour.  Casual and cool, a simple place for a quick cheap beer......why not a 5?  It is a DIVE BAR<//Text>< pictures>

This place will really make you say one more, that's it. The prices are ridiculous and the atmosphere is lacking. Get your buzz and get out.</review>

<text>Dirty and bartender had a giant cold sore on her mouth and kept wiping with her hand and making food and drinks with no gloves she didn't wash her hands once. We watched her serve the whole bar and make hot dogs and hamburgers before we were so grossed out we left. No way I was letting her make me a drink after that. So disgusted</text>< pictures>

Not many women two pool tables juke box normal dive bar i was loving it...except no women of decent stature and available...so 4 stars only...< /Text>

Fair overall experience. Purchased tires from them, received some discounts on future purchases. $40 credit for a oil change wouldn’t cover synthetic Blend. They charged $80 and took $40 off. I called my usual shop, their price was $38 no coupon necessary.</review>

<Review>My tire was leaking air for no good reason so I came in to get my tire pressure checked. Jairo took the extra time to triple check for nails and that sort of thing and found nothing. He asked me to come in the next day (it was near closing time) so they can get to the bottom of it. I tried to give him a $20 tip for his help but he wouldn't take it. The next morning Mitch, Jairo and Victor were all very helpful. Turns out, a label wasn't removed when my car dealership installed the tire and that label was causing air to leak. Any other place would have made up a safety concern story just to sell me a tire (it's happened MANY times before) but they actually cared to solve the problem and took the time to do it. They earned my trust and I highly recommend them.<//Review><rate>5</rate><Date>1587069785769< /Date>< UserId.>

Sure, their prices are okay but so far we have had to come back multiple times because they just cant fix it correctly. They are refusing a refund on work that had not been done yet, the manager told us do not ask them when the car will be ready because they will not be answering any questions about the car while it is in their possession...the mechanics are of the poorest quality of work, there is no time management and when going in for something as simple as an oil change, all of a sudden something else is broken to where the car us unsafe to drive. I don't see how an oil change can all of a sudden ruin the ABS, now, that light is on, the check engine light, amongst others. I'm now having to bring the car elsewhere. TERRIBLE<//text>< username>

<Review>Great Service, Very Friendly but just make sure that your paperwork has everything correct before you leave. Example: Name, Tires Size, etc. I will have to return to get everything corrected because as most of us know, if you return for maintenance or any of your coverage issues, it can be said that the tires are not the one's installed or it's not you because the name is really really off, etc., etc, etc. But overall great prices and service.</Review>< pics>

I had shocks replaced, tires, brakes, rotors, and alignments done here. I had to return multiple times because of install issues with my brakes. They turned my rotors twice within a month and refused to replace them due to their incompetence. I came in every 5000 miles for a rotation and alignment check. My tires got less than 30000 miles and showed wear due to "lackn of rotation" and "poor alignment". I called before going in to warranty my 50000 mile tires and was told that they would take care of it. When I arrived they refused to warranty my tires and offered to give me a "great deal" on a new set. The price was 50% more than the original set I bought from them. The reasoning they had for not warrantying my tires was due to lacknof maintinence and that they lost all of my records. They apparently had me wait an hour and a half to two and a half hours for each check and rotation and apparently never did the service. When I went to a different tire shop they found that the install on my ahocks were sub par. Run from this company, they do not back their work or honor warranties.<//Text>

We came here on a recommendation via our roommate and we are not disappointed. We had a shard of metal in our tire and because it is so close to where we had another repair done, the tire needs to be replaced. They didnt have our tires but ordered them for us and even though we won't have the money for the replacement until Saturday, they are replacing it tomorrow for us. Art is extremely honest and trustworthy and I'd recommend this company to anyone in need of repairs. Also, the lady up front is very sweet.<//review>

Great price matching on tires and alignment. They were able to find tires that other tire shops couldn't. I watched them closely as they performed the alignment and installed the tires. They did a great job. I will go back again.</Text>

<UserId.>103918047382705951997<//UserId.><Review>WOW!  Went in for a flat tire repair and was told I should probably get new tires.  Of course that is something a tire shop would say, but what they did next really set them apart.  Art took me to the bay where my car was lifted and showed me the wires on the inner part of the tire away from the rim.  I was shocked.  He took me back to the front counter and proceeded to show me some prices for different kinds of tires.  I though it was really cool that he broke it down by Good, Better Best..  I'm a very frugal person, so I asked him if I can go shop around first.  He didn't try to haggle or tell me they had the best prices.  Well, it turns out they did have the best prices and knowing that Art didn't try to pressure me really made me feel comfortable with that shop.  Art and the guys at the shop were very friendly and a situation that could have been a nightmare was made bearable by the awesome guys at this shop.</Review><user_name>Louie Elorduy</user_name><pictures>None<//pictures><gmapID>0x80dd268b203fd85f:0x1a6ad1dae0187e9a<//gmapID><date>1478098482027< /date><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

This place was awsome. The staff was friendly. It was a holiday weekend so i expected a long wait but the work was done quickly. And i waited on site. And ended up with a new windshield wiper at no cost!</text>

Not happy. Needed an oil change and two new tires for a toyota corolla. Decided to sit and wait at the shop, nobody said anything about it taking a long time. They let me sit there for an hour and 45 mins never once telling me that a job that should take no more then 45 mins was going to take more then double that amount of time. On top of that charged me $50+ for the oil change and tried to sell me $80+ for an alignment . No thanks. Will not return. Nice catchy discount scam. You will be paying full price.< /text>

My wife brought her car in for a new tire and some other stuff about a year ago...  I usually do the work on our cars, but Im done getting dirty.  I knew exactly what needed to be done and the stuff coming up soon...They told her what she needed with out tacking on a bunch of extra stuff she didnt need and warned her of the stuff coming up soon.  They offered great prices and now this is where we bring our cars...  I still find the same good service and treatment.  However, the establishment could be a bit cleaner and nicer.</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><pics>None<//pics><review>Disappointing all the way around. I took a day off work to get new tires. I called for a quote and asked how long it would take. Kahala said 1 hour but he would have to call me back about the price. I waited an hour and called them back. I was told they forgot to call me back. Nice. At least I got the price but when I asked about the cost of replacing a sensor he told me he would have to call me back. I waited 1.5 hours and still no call call. Yup he forgot again. When I called he apologized and assured me that they would have the tires installed within an hour, so no worries, right? He was a nice guy on the phone - just forgetful. Its now about 3 pm and I show up at their store with a semi-flat tire. Kahala tells me that there was a mistake and they don't have the tires. Not surprised, I said how long until it's done? He said his manager, Art, was driving to Santa Fe Springs to get them during 405 rush hour. Perfect. A simple call to inform me that they couldn't get it done in an hour would have been courteous but that's not part of the Discount Tires Center customer service plan I guess. They figured they would just make me wait 3 hours be I have nothing better to do. It was impossible for the job to be finished within an hour since it would take about that long just to get to Santa Fe Springs. Feeling upset and disappointed that I wasted my day off work trying to buy tires from these guys, I decided to move on and drive away with an even flatter tire than I showed up with. Complete fail. I decided to see if they could get it right today. When I called to see if the tires were in stock, Art answers the phone. He said he's not sure since Kahala was handling that order. Wait a minute... Art was the person that was "supposed" to be picking up the tires yesterday so he should know whether or not he picked them up. So I waited some more for him to "find out" and then he said they cancelled the order because I cancelled the appointment yesterday. Huh? I was already in the store. When I asked how could I cancel an appointment that I was already at for 15 minutes Art was rude and started talking over me and refused to hear my question. Nice. I have no idea why I would give them a second shot after the lousy treatment yesterday but I guess I was thinking that they would at least have the tires and maybe they would make good on dropping the ball with me yesterday. Nope. Art, the manager that "drove" to Santa Fe Springs to get the tires, decided to model lousy customer service in front of his crew. I told him how disappointed I was and hung up. He calls me back a few minutes later to tell me they cancelled the tire order??? Peace out Discount Tire Center of Huntington Beach.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dd268b203fd85f:0x1a6ad1dae0187e9a< /Gmap_id><Date>1513373706260<//Date><user>108056704522792483187<//user>< Resp>

Been a customer for I say 2 yrs. At first they were very good , even though it woulf take 3hrs for a changing of a tire or oil service but thanks to the nearby theatre it was no problem, prices were good.

Then that's when the problems started. It seems once they get to know you  as a regular customer they pay less attention and put less importance with you. I kidd you not I left my car TWICE the whole day and never recieved a call back with the estimate. Instead when I called them the next morning they said over the phone that they were too busy to start with my car. On one occasion I left my car there and it came back with a wierd noise which wasn't there before. I was advised  to just drive around since it didn't seem to be a big problem. But since my gf was pregnant I could take a chance. Long story short It was something significant but too complex to explain. The car was there for 2 weeks. At least they didn't charge me. The final straw was when I brought the same car back because the check engine light came on. I left it on a Monday and they wouldn't call me nor would they pick up my calls. It wasnt till Thursday when I used a different cell phone that they picked up. When asked for status on the car they said that the employee whom specialized with that problem is on leave due to a death in the family. Not sure if it's true but they could have let me know on Monday. Car sat there for 4 days. At thr end I realized they didn't want to do business with me and didn't have the heart to tell me. The Manager Art is a good man but he has a bunch of his friends working and taking advantage of his kindness and hard workmanship. He has taken over his dad whom ran it before him. Art can't be everywhere at once and needs to handle his friends/employees, needs to take charge. They know if they read this I am speaking the truth. I am the guy who used to own the working  Pontiac grand am.<//Review>

I had my two young kids with me and this is my only car.  We were going to walk to a burger stand so my daughter could do home work and we could snack while waiting for my car.  Since it was cold out the owner ensured we had a ride there.  When I returned we found out that there was a mix up when my rotors arrived and my car would not be available until the next day.

First time there and the food was delicious. Will definitely be back. My husband had the prime rib and I had their t-bone. The meat was so tender and flavorful. Staff was very friendly and excellent customer service.</Review>

Absolutely wonderful steak place.  I had the prime rib and it was melt in your mouth.  I want to try the rib eye next.  Staff is so friendly and helpful. Their 2 egg breakfast was great.  I'll go back for sure.< /Text>

<Text>Apparently the state of Nevada tourism board has invited people to tag the vehicles.   This has resulted in the art being sprayed over.  This, in my opinion, has diminished the uniqueness and allure of the car forest.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>People, food atmosphere all great.  Like every where prices are going up, but I'm happy to say at Ryderz you get your $$ worth.... Highly recommend, also go by and play a game if pool in their clean Bar/lounge<//review></record></dataset><record>

The food was decent but the charge was different from the bill..... it was not that much different but a few dollars times how many customers? Basically the bill for 2 people was 38 and with the tip the total came to 42 but the bill charged was 51...<//review>

Food never came almost 40 minutes after ordering. Asked about our food. They never even gave us an update. Person bringing drinks n coffee was great. Other than that. Worst service I've ever had!

<Review>They have a really nice Prime Rib special on Friday nights! For breakfast I enjoy the basic Old Fashion Oatmeal with all the fixin’s and a side of Bacon but if you don’t to crispy make sure to tell them otherwise it’s really crispy! The Staff is friendly and good service too! It’s a Country atmosphere as they play Classic Country music i the background. I enjoy visiting this place with my Grandchildren. They serve Mickey Mouse pancakes for the youngsters.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< name>

Not good experience today. Been going to Ryderz for the last 8 years always good. Today service was not a good experance. Started off as usual with coffee, gave waitress our order, asked to make sure our English muffin was VERY crispy. Order came fast, when we received to muffin it was barely cook asked to redue when the waitress return she stated they were extrimly busy so we accepted it. Than we received the bill, coffee went up in price $3.59 a cup. I feel we should have been told of the addional cost before we ordered it..When we questioned it head waitess said when food price's go up that also includes the drinks. (No sorry). We won't be going back. (Sorry).<//text>

<review>Overall: it was good

Cons: Expensive!

The prices listed on Google are incorrect. They are half the prices of what they actually charge. Or maybe this place just charged me double?

My order was a burger and basket of rings/fries

Google has it listed: 7.99 + 3.99.
Ryders charged me: 13.99 + 7.99.
They didn't confirm the price over the phone(i know no restaurant usually does without asking). So, I didn't know till I was receiving the food. Dont like to cause any issues so I accepted and now I know.

My review of the food - It was good. Fries were made perfect. Burger was just good. Burger patty was to small for the bun. 1/4 of the bun was left over once the burger was done. So I would say no where worth 14 dollars.<//review>< pictures>

The food is okay, but the service is usually really good if you go during the day. The night younger servers are not as catering. The buns they use with there food are always soft and flavorful, that's what keeps us going.</review>

<Text>The food and service was good!  Minus 1 star because when we were asked what we wanted to drink and I asked what kind of beer they had, the girl responded with, "I don't know, coors and coors light I guess.  I don't go back to the bar".
Maybe she was new.  She should have just offered to get someone else to help.< /Text>< pictures>

The food was good but what was really sad was that after looking online at the menu I was informed the prices were not correct. The server that answered the phone was rude and abrupt. She let me know that the company who designed the website would charge them 250.00 to change prices. Truly that is none of my concern. I was not given the printed prices and mentioned they take down the website and was hung up on. Not the right way to do business in this time or any time. Get it right Ryderz!< /Text>

<text>I’m Italian, I’ve tried this restaurant driving on the street going to Yosemite...
Well I adore it. It takes me into another mindset.
It looks like I am in a real American Diner, with no turists and a good atmosphere.
The blond woman who served us is really kind and she customized without any problem the order we made. The staff is working with the smile on their face and the space is clean. I loved it and I enjoyed myself. Thank you Ryderz!< /text>< Pics>

Absolutely amazing. Came here with my fiancée and future father-in-law and had a really great night. The 16oz steak was perfect and the fries tasted amazing. Also never had a great salad until I came to this place. Definitely would drive an hour again to come back.< /Review>

<Text>The service was horrible. The waitress only came buy our table once. The food was horrible. My wife ordered a three cheese omelette, and it wasn't cooked all of the way. The cheese on top of and inside wasn't even melted and it was cold, so my wife didn't eat. When we told the waitress, she acted like she didn't really care and said, "Oh, well I guess I'll give you a $5.00 discount.". I'm thankful for the discount, but really. Should have removed the whole meal from the bill. Never going there again.< /Text><Rating>1<//Rating><Name>Brian Williams</Name>< GmapID>

Get a new cook!
We've ordered a hamburger and prime rib.  It took much too long for our food to be served, it was overlooked, and the stake went back to the kitchen. I've tried to have a medium hamburger instead,  and it as well was overcooked and dry.
For other hand the restaurant manager Virginia intervened and was willing to satisfy us in any possible way and she offered many  options for compensation,  so her attitude gets a 5 star mark.!</review>

Great restaurant . I absolutely love their fried pickles and the hot wings are my favorite! I only put 4 stars because I have a 1 month old and there is no changing table and I really don't like having to change him on a little bench or on the floor in the restroom.<//review>

<text>Husband and I walked in Christmas Eve and we didnt realize they were closing in 30  minutes because of Holiday. Waitress said we could go ahead and order. And we appreciated that very much . We were willing to leave no problem . FOOD WAS GOOD , SERVICE WAS GREAT SO THANK ALL EMPLOYEES WORKING THAT DAY 🤶🎅😊😊<//text></record>

<text>At one time, we were regulars here.  The service is awful.  We were so very embarrassed when we brought in our family for a visit.  You practically have to beg for coffee and water refills.  It takes 15+ minutes to get your order taken.  And then the wait to get your food.

We've only been there for breakfast.  The service has been so bad (for example, servers chewing out staff in front of us), we've given up on this place.  Decent food.  Decent prices.  Gosh awful service.<//text><Name>John Sturgis< /Name><Rate>2< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x8090f9ced36e4921:0x80c7ba9a4dffbb9e</Gmap_id><date>1538429066709</date>< response>

< Review>
Extremely slow service, waited almost 30 mins for three orders and there were only 4 other tables occupied. Our hostess was either very strange or on drugs of some kind. The person who took our order and brought us our food was very nice and apologetic for the wait time. Table was dirty and had sticky syrup on it. I've been here several times before and it was not like this so not sure what's happening there. I had the club sandwich and would not order it again. However the thick cut sweet potato fries were delicious.</Review>

Living in town, I usually go to Ryderz about once a month.

It's usually never crowded so being seated and ordering is easy. The wait staff is friendly and will always take the time to get your order right.

The food is pretty average. Tasty, but nothing special. The portions are not always that generous.

The menu has a good number of choices. That is one of the things I like most about Ryderz.</Review>

Horrible service. The bad service explains why there was only 3 tables occupied when we arrived. The lady who sat us and took our drink order was the only nice person there. The waitress spent her time on the phone and ignoring customers. Cooks took 20 mins to make 3 sandwiches and 1 burger, but sent out a raw burger that was undercooked. Didn't get any dressing for our salads and had to ask 3 times for it.<//text>

We waited at least 30 minutes for a waitress to take our order but were ignored as the waitresses took orders from other people who had come in after we did.  We informed the hostess thatcwe were ready to order.  She informed the waitress, whoturned to look at us.  We waited five more minutes after this.  She walked by us twice more during this time withoit a word and took another otder from another customer who had entered after we did.  We got up and walked out I  will NOT return.< /text>

There web site said it was one price and when I pick up order, my order was much higher.. I think this is false advertisement. My food was just luke warm. I did try to resolve the issue while I was there but I was told I to talk to manger and I was also told that manager is only in the mornings..</text>

Food was great, and the service was friendly. I had the lunch special, which is a burger and fries. My son had pancakes, the wife had chicken club, and the daughter had a hotdog.  Everyone was pleased.< /Text>

<review>Like a really bad Dennys, really bad!:tortilla soup was super salty, seemed more like a really runny chilli with tons of taco season. Steak was ordered med rare, came well done and tasted like old meat. No flavor. Veggies were frozen not fresh and soggy. Baked potato was probably 3 days old, not fresh. Husband ordered eggs benedict and he said his meal rated about 2.5. I won't be back. Not even willing to give second chance. On a good note,  the service was decent and restaurant was clean.<//review>< pics>

They give you a large portion of food which is great and the food taste very good, I would like to go again soon but food can be pricey for some things and they gave us our salad we ordered then brought our food out a couple minutes after which we felt kind of rushed since the restaurant did not have lots people at moment but overall the place had very good food which is great of great value.< /Review>

<Text>Good food, VERY hearty portions ... mainly american style menu items; i like the chicken fried steak, and the pancakes are HUGE so unless i'm super hungry i usually just go with toast for breakfast.

good atmosphere, nothing too fancy, and servers are great, but sometimes during rush hours they're pretty tied up ...<//Text>< GmapID>

Walked in and nobody was in there except some other patrons.  Waited for at least 5 minutes before my husband went and looked for someone.  He looked all over, including in the kitchen and there wasn't even a cook in the kitchen.  Just as we were getting ready to leave a waitress came out.<//review>
