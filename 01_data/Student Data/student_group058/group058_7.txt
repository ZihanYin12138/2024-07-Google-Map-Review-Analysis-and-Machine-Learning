A great storage place in the cut. Dont be fooled by the entrance with the old cars. This place is fully secured with gated access and top of the line security system. Lots of parking . Staff are great and very helpful. Best prices in town!!! Go check them out.
Ask for Saira , she is amazing and very informative.</text>

At first I thought the place was ok,was referred by a friend . Two months into my rental was asked to relocate. There was no explanation for this. I feel the office workers are racist. Often I would see people sleeping in their truck, and carefree of the seven o'clock hr. cerfew. The people would be still on the property after-hours, that I can't understand. The staff workers that clean up didn't speak English,plus was rather rude blarring his Spanish music as loud as possible. , even I after asked could he please turn it down. Bottom line is that I am being evicted for no clear reason, this is ok because I no longer want to be at that place, I'll take my money somewhere else . I'd love to actually count how many people are Caucasian that rent there, I'm certain not many at all. This is too bad, not good business. Thanks</Text>

For a self storage their hours arent too great. They look to be pretty clean, its always empty when I go. Never had a bug problem in my apartment, packed no food what's so ever. But there managed to be bugs in my locker.. Little winged bugs, like fruit flys. Hmm< /text>

The service was great and the experience even better. Definitely recommend if you're a thrill seeker like me ! They take you out into the ocean first; it was a beautiful day. You don't get wet but there are a few splashes here and there.</Review>

<text>Truly the most EXHILARATING moment of my life.  I've never felt like that. And I was TERRIFIED at first, but Eric, Billy, and Captain Kodi put my fears at ease and allowed my fiance and I to have one of the lost magical experiences of our lives.
Even after losing our SD card from the GoPro (ling after the boat ride when cleaning out the rental car 😭😭) Eric was so helpful and helped us to be able to secure another ride when we come back so we can recreate the memories! And THAT is what I call goung above and beyond!!!

The calm that you feel hundreds of feet above the water, the quiet that surrounds you, the stillness of the air while looking down at the water below you.... nothing compares.

We will definitely be back! Thank you so so much for such an unforgettable time!

Sending love all the way from Cincinnati!</text>< Resp>

Very fun event. Two adventures in one. The ride out to the start of the Parasailing event was pretty epic. Speed and more speed is the norm and I loved it. Very efficient process, with a relaxing and exhilarating experience. There is nothing to be scared about....that is if you listen to their instructions. DON'T HOLD ON TO THE CLIPS. It was an great and amazing adventure.</review>

The boat ride out was fun but the highlight is of course the parasailing. The ascent is very cool and smooth and once you are up there it is absolutely breathtaking! It's calmer and quieter once sailing up above than while riding the boat. The view is amazing and the captain did a very good job of giving us various views by driving the boat around while we were up there. Lots of dolphins and sea lions to see. A few whale sightings from a distance. All in all very very cool! My wife, my 8 year old and I went up together and it was a great ride!</Review>< Pics>

What a great experience! I booked online (12 people max per time slot), and noticed that sometimes there are discounts for last-minute bookings / early departures (e.g., 9 AM).

The check-in office is located to the left of the Deli on the second floor.
Take off and landing are done at the back of the boat, and one does not typically get wet (except maybe a quick feet dip during landing).

The flight time for us lasted about 10 minutes for each pair. I recommend getting the 800ft package, because the views up there are pretty amazing. Make sure to bring some cash to tip the guides as they do a fantastic job of keeping things safe and moving on time.

Caution: The boat ride can get pretty rough, but they do provide barf bags onboard :)</text>

<review>This was by far one of the funnest experiences that I have had in a very long time! Once we arrived - we checked in on the computer - waited a short time and headed outside. Kodi was preparing the boat so that we could depart. He explained a few safety rules and gave a brief description of how things were going to go once it was time to begin our parasailing adventure. Me and my boyfriend did the 800 foot and purchase a go Pro camera and it was totally a awesome experience and an adrenaline rush like you wouldn’t believe. You get a beautiful view of all the mountains and downtown San Diego - a site you would never believe. The landing was smooth - as we were coming down - he dipped us in the water just to our knees- pulled us back up and then pulled us to safety. This was one of those experiences that will never be forgotten and I highly recommend to anybody who has not tried this. The staff was super friendly and you will have an amazing time!< /review>< pics>

We had an amazing experience with them. Even though my hubby was a ride along they made him feel like part of the group. I paid extra for the go pro and had a lovely experience.< /review>

So good, in fact, I returned later with my sister and nieces who were also vacationing in San Diego.  Even though she normally has a fear of the ocean, she reported she had a wonderful time, and can't wait to repeat the trip!

If you are even remotely considering this activity, then I highly recommend this experience and company.

<review>Alot of fun. It was surprisingly very peaceful up there (more of a ferris wheel type speed than a roller coaster). We were able to wear glasses and hats the whole time.</review>< pics>

<review>The team parasail crew is great ! They have a great safety record and know how to show you a fun time. The trip i went on we had teens to grandparents, they all flew and loved it. :-)

This is one of San DIego’s best kept secret destinations for family fun. Don’t miss out if you ever thought about parasailing, this is the place to give it try.

I didnt take any pictures sorry, I left my phone and camera in the truck.</review></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I wanted to take a group of my friends parasailing for my birthday. During the entire process, Arrit was amazing! I called him so much it was like we became friends as not once did he complain or not answer my millions of questions. He did everything in his power to find ways to meet my expectation within my budget. This entire 5-star rating is for him.

My actual parasailing trip was good. They let us choose the music, the boat ride was fun and we safely parasailed. I have one complaint. Me and 3 friends had the boat to ourselves and the captain only let us ride once even though the trip was supposed to last 1.25 hours. The ride before us started late and ended late and me and my friends time was cut because of it. Fair? I don't know. We were the final trip that day so it wasn't like there was another group waiting to ride.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>It was a great experience working with Amar as he is the best and helps you get what you want. We started with a couple of zoom calls rolling on. Amar executed the Listing tasks at super speed, guidance with remodeling, staging, working with Vendors, and transparency in the whole process. Amar is taking care of everything, like selling his own home.

If you want your dream home as a buyer or the best price when selling, Amar is the go-to person. Be transparent with Amar on what you want; he will deliver it to you.

Kudos to you and your team, Special thanks for making this happen and getting our home sold for the highest price ever in the community. At the same time, Amar is making sure all needed things are in place for buyers to make it their Dream Home!<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<review>Amar and his team made our dream of buying house into real. Because of their hard work and team effort we could buy our dream house. Amar got the BEST DEAL in the market. He PERSONALLY involved in ALL areas (Loan, Escrow, and closing). He helped us to select our perfect house for our family needs. We just showed Amar the house we liked and rest of the thinks his team took care .His team stayed on TOP of EVERY activity in the entire process to make sure end goal is accomplished as smooth as possible. The whole process of buying house happened in few weeks peacefully, now we enjoy our stay in our new house. We really want to thank Amar and his team for making our dream house into real.</review>< Response>

We were looking for an ideal home for over 2 years . We met Amar through one of our family friends and since then our home hunt approach completely changed. There are several great things which I have seen and experienced in working with Amar. - He has been very focused on sending us only listings which have been very relevant to us. - He has an excellent network with builders and other realtors which helped in getting information before hand. - His deep relationships and credibility with builders and lenders have helped us in getting deep discounts, free upgrades as well as very competitive rates. - He has been a ONE STOP shop for us right from house hunt to finish (Lender, Home insurance, Home warranty and others). - He has helped us not just as a realtor but also helped us in making the right decisions by presenting clear facts, when we were undecided at times. - He gave us ample time to make thoughtful decisions and never hurried or pressurized us into making quick decisions. - His negotiation skills, guidance, and his team bar none. - He is available ALL the time over the phone or email or personnel meetings. - He stay on top of every process to give THE BEST home buying experience. I would definitely recommend him anytime for any real estate needs. Thank You and Awesome job Amar!!!</text>

<Review>My family and I would like to thank Amar being such a wonderful Realtor®. He managed to do something many of the other Realtors® could not, he helped us find our dream home. When we first began looking for houses, we were having a very hard time since the housing market was so busy. Most of the Realtors® just seemed to be interested in selling houses as fast as they could manage but Mr. Amarnath took his time to help us find a house with everything we hoped for. With two daughters, one going to the sixth grade and the other going to the ninth grade, we had to pay attention to the schools as well as the home itself. In the end he saved us up to 6k on closing costs and 10K less than the authorized offer price.

Being the first time buyers with lot of things to understand he never let us feel as first time home buyers. Once we liked the house he worked at mercurial speed to make sure we got the house, at same time he made sure that nothing was overlooked. We are really impressed by his knowledge of sellers mindset. we are also really impressed the way he treated us like one of his family members and the in the whole process he acted as though he is buying the house for his own family members<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Our HOME Buying experience was excellent and stress free with Amar, Sri and Team. It is not easy in the current market to get a single family home in Bay Area. I was very skeptical and almost lost hope, and early 2017 I put myself out of market. There came along my new to be home in market, both me and my wife liked the layout and we called Amar and Sri to proceed on it. Amar and team wrote an excellent offer though quoted less than competition, the offer terms were lucrative. All credit goes to “Amar”.
Amar has strong negotiation skills and persuaded listing agent to accept our offer less than the competition offers. On decision day, Amar called me and congratulated me, “Our offer got accepted”.
Amar has excellent field connections, he introduced me to a lender who offered a competitive rate for 10% down, and the entire process was seamless. Being a new home Buyer, I was little panicking but Amar and team total made it seamless by doing all the heavy weight lifting for me. I was kept appraised on all the process. Amar is very efficient, and he stays top of the core process, and really makes the right move at right time.
I strongly recommend Amar and Team, if you are looking to Buy or Sell HOME.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

We want to thank Amar for all his help these past few months. His hard work helped us find our dream home, and we couldn't be more grateful or excited about this next step in our journey. He is like our family now and his team is some of the most professional yet warm and friendly people we have met. Amar always pleasantly surprised us with how he went above and beyond our expectations every step of the way in our home purchase process - from advising on the pros and cons of homes, locations and neighborhoods to mitigating any concerns of the loan/title company to guiding us with the closing processes/steps. It felt like a one-stop shop for the entire home buying journey which made our lives really easy and the process enjoyable. The transparent communication and constant availability to answer all our questions any time of the day is something very rare to find. He is the best and we couldn't have gotten our dream home without his expertise, guidance and support.<//review>

<Text>I worked with Amar last December 2015 on getting our first home here in the bay area and I would have to say that he along with his wife Sri are very client oriented. He has very good attention to detail and was always available to answer any question that came in to my mind.

He also referred us to good vendors which made the buying experience very smooth. I would recommend Amar and his team specially for first time home buyers like me.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Amar and Sri came highly recommended from our friends who had just bought a house and I am glad we decided to work with them. Me and my wife both strongly believe that they made the impossible happen for us.

Amar and Sri got our dream home for us. The entire process was seamless and smoothly executed. Right from the very first meeting we could sense that they had our best interest in mind and were genuinely interested in helping us get the right home. Amar and Sri helped formulate a winning strategy and guided us through all the steps including what to look for in a prospective home & neighborhood, what to avoid, how to approach the seller’s agents etc. A fact we appreciated was that they advised against any house/neighborhood that was not right or safe. After we liked a house they had an indepth discussion with us to make sure we are interested in the property for the right reasons.

Once the ground work was done, they helped us come up with a winning bid and negotiated the best possible deal. We could reach out to Amar or Sri anytime to discuss anything throughout the process including but not limited to shortlisting and reviewing properties, deciding a winning bid, reviewing disclosures, navigating the escrow process, getting a loan and eventually closing on the deal.

We have already recommended them to all our friends and look forward to working with them if we decide to buy another property.< /text>

Amar and Sri helped us with our first home buying process. We started about a month ago and were pretty naive in the process. Amar and Sri guided us in a clear step by step manner. They helped define clear, achievable goals based on our priorities for the house, with which we were able to narrow down on an area. Sri provided us invaluable insights about neighborhoods and community. We searched homes online and went for open houses only for the properties which Sri recommended. We did not waste time and effort in looking at homes that did not fit our criteria.

After selecting the property, Amar helped us with the offer by working together with us. In a hot seller's market, he helped us in getting the best possible deal. Post offer acceptance, he gets involved in all areas like loan closing, insurance, warranty, escrow - to ensure that everything goes smoothly and on time. Amar's and Sri's help doesn't stop there. They provide guidance and help post-closing as well - something crucial for first-time homebuyers like us. We are immensely thankful to Amar and Sri for their support. They made the process simple and less stressful. Having a good realtor like Amar and his team really makes a difference.< /Text>

Dear Amar and Sri Amar,

We are incredibly thankful to you both for your extraordinary efforts in winning our house in a very tough competition. We realized that to win an offer needs deep knowledge in the market, connections, the right strategy, negotiation skills, and you are at the top in all of those aspects. Within two months, we could win the house, and that’s just my second offer. We should highlight that Sri Amar helps explain and clarify all our doubts in the process. Right from winning the offer, you executed the plan quickly, and we never felt stressed anywhere in the process. Our strong recommendation to any of our friends is that, if you are serious about buying a house, don’t waste time. Just go to Amar. He will win your dream home for you.</Review>

<text>I would like to use this opportunity to thank you and Sri for helping me and my wife to find our dream home. You guided us in each step like a dependable friend and getting us in right direction in the home buying process.

We were clueless on the entire home buying process in the beginning, wandering in different directions with different thoughts. You not only helped us understand what we really wanted as our home but also made us realize our potential of buying a property in the bay area.. Your good reputation in the market along with your passion and dedication for work is truly commendable. It's really extraordinary that the way you executed the perfect plan by following up on every details to close the deal in 18 days without much friction.

We appreciate your entire team who works closely and swiftly to win a deal. We are truly humbled to have you as our agent. I specially thank Sri for dedicating lot of time for us and being available all the time to answer our queries and concerns. You guys would be a perfect choice for young couples like us to win a dream house. Thank you once again.< /text>< pics>

Amar and Sri are indeed a top-notch realtor team. They helped me get a new property in the 95130 zip code. They brought me an excellent opportunity to buy a home in the 95130 zip code. Unfortunately, I did not have enough money for the down payment to buy a new property. However, Sri and Amar gave me an idea of how I could still buy the property. Amar connected me to a loan agent who worked with me to get cash out refi of one of my existing properties, which I used to buy this new property. The new property was a probate sale, and hence it was a lot more bureaucratic. Amar handled it seamlessly. At the same time, he pushed the loan agent to complete my loans, the cash-out refi, and the loan to buy the new property and get me the property in record time, given that it is a probate sale. Amar’s execution is flawless, and his ability to manage complex and tricky situations is unmatched in the Real Estate business. In this case, Amar oversaw an estate sale, managed the attorneys, pushed two different loans simultaneously. My friends who have purchased properties through Amar will also vouch for handling such complex situations with ease.

I would heartily recommend Amar and Sri for your real estate needs.<//review>

<review>* First-time buyer * COVID pandemic * Competitive environment * When we first decided to purchase a house, we did not know what it involves to own a home. When we talked to Amar for the first time (for almost more than one hour), he explained the entire process starting from house search to having a key in our hand. He listened to every question and answered thoroughly. That was the first sign of having such a reliable and knowledgeable person as our agent. After that, we started looking for listings we were interested in. We always received the first-hand opinion from Sri Amar whether to even look at that property. Given the COVID situation, it was very timely help, and her suggestions helped us narrow down our search. When we decided our house and put an offer, Amar and the team excelled in all possible ways to get our offer accepted (though it was not the highest bid offer). One suggestion from Amar was to write a personal letter to the seller, and that did magic. After our offer got accepted (with the tightest deadline of 21 days with the COVID situation), the entire execution of the plan by Amar and the team was phenomenal. Amar provided contact with a housing loan agent, home insurance agent, home warranty agent who all are dependable. We do not need to step out of our house to look for anything. The entire collaboration and execution were so powerful that we have a key to our house on day 20. Even after closing the deal, Amar and Sri provided valuable suggestions. As per Amar, this is just the beginning of our new relationship. We are impressed with the way Amar and his teamwork and provide a personal touch. We will highly recommend him for any real estate requirement.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808fbb3929619d47:0x86def5a5a9d84c50<//Gmap_id></record>

I want to thank Amar and Sri for making the home purchase dream come true for us. As first-time home buyers, Amar and Sri guided us with every step of the process and made us feel informed and comfortable with all the decisions.

We got in touch with Amar through a friend. In our first meeting, Amar walked us through the entire home buying process and answered all our queries.

Sri’s knowledge about the Bay area neighborhoods is unmatched. The ROI for a property and guidance on what things to look for in the house as a buyer helped us narrow down the search. Sri swiftly followed up with new information on a property we share, which is a big plus in this time-sensitive and highly competitive market. She also provided her honest opinion about the property.

Collaborating with Amar for a detailed walkthrough of house disclosures helped us make an informed decision.

Winning the offer for our house was exceptional. Amar was able to negotiate a deal against all odds and win us our dream home. Even though our offer was not accepted on the first attempt, Amar’s negotiation skills and persistence in talking with the listing agent helped us reconsider our offer. It was unbelievable to know that our offer got picked even though it was not the highest. It was great to have Amar and his team on our side.

After our offer was accepted, Amar had the whole process streamlined. He was personally involved in getting us through the escrow, insurance, loan, and closing process. Amar and Sri were on top of every activity and ensured all stakeholders completed the tasks on time.

We feel fortunate and happy to have worked with Amar and Sri for our first home purchase. We strongly recommend Amar and Sri to anyone looking for a house in the Bay area.</text>

<review>We chose Amar and Sri to buy an investment property as they had previously helped us with the purchase of our primary home. We expressed our interest in purchasing a property, and within 3 weeks we signed a deal. Sri led the way by going through the things we should look for in an investment property as well as the zip codes. Sri's insights were extremely valuable as we were unfamiliar with the area . She provided feedback on whether a property was worth pursuing, as well as pros and cons, for each one that I sent her way. She also made sure that we stayed within our budget. It was overwhelming at first because we didn't have any clear requirements on what we wanted, and the market was crazy post vaccine. Sri's valuable inputs helped us in pinning the house quickly. Amar's extensive knowledge, negotiation skill, and realtor network helped us secure a good deal. We got the keys in 25 days, just like the last time.

We are very happy with our purchase.Having a great realtor is the key to buying a house in the hot sellers' market. I highly recommend Amar and Sri!</review><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808fbb3929619d47:0x86def5a5a9d84c50</Gmap_id><Time>1623127491447< /Time></record>

We used Amar and the team to sell our home in. We received top-notch service from the get-go and finally our home sold for $100K over asking in a market that is softening due to COVID-19. These are simply outstanding results. Amar’s experience and strategy really came to bear when our home inspection report showed that there were significant areas of concern with our home. Amar worked with us and the buyers to ensure that the issues were fixed without any effect on the sales price. To top that both we and the buyers were very satisfied with the outcome. How he did it we don’t know but all we can say is that we were simple bowled over. Amar is an expert in two-sided negotiations and he ensures that the most competitive results are achieved for his clients in a way that leaves everybody involved very satisfied. Amar has an expert support team for home staging, inspections and escrow. We felt like we received white glove service throughout and we could not be more happy with the results Amar achieved for us.</Review>

It is not easy in the current market to get a single family home in Bay Area. I was very skeptical and almost lost hope. I put myself out of market. There came along my new to be home in market, both me and my wife liked the layout and we called Amar and Sri to proceed on it.

Amar and team wrote an excellent offer though quoted less than competition, the offer terms were lucrative. All credit goes to “Amar”.
Amar has strong negotiation skills and persuaded listing agent to accept our offer less than the competition offers. On decision day, Amar called me and congratulated me, “Our offer got accepted”.
Amar has excellent field connections, he introduced me to a lender who offered a competitive rate for 10% down, and the entire process was seamless. Being a new home Buyer, I was little panicking but Amar and team total made it seamless by doing all the heavy weight lifting for me. I was kept appraised on all the process. Amar is very efficient, and he stays top of the core process, and really makes the right move at right time.

I strongly recommend Amar and Team, if you are looking to Buy or Sell HOME.</review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Great Thanks to Amar, Sri, and the Team

We have no words to express our gratitude to Sri and Amar, who helped us find our new home. We never imagined buying a home in this competitive market.  Sri helped find us our new home. She helped us in every step and made us feel very comfortable in finding the best home. She cares about what’s best for us and feels like they are part of our family.

Regarding Amar, he was the one who helped us to make the closing process go smoothly.  We just gave our offer price. That’s it. Amar and his team did the whole process, and we have nothing to worry about. Within 25 days, we got the keys. We have no pressure in finding our lender, or Home Insurance, or Home Warranty. Everything was taken care of by Amar’s team.

On the whole, both of them are honest, professional, knowledgeable, and friendly people. We have an excellent experience working with them. We highly recommend them to anyone who has any idea about buying a new home.< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I wanted to buy a property in Fremont. Amar explained to me regarding the home buying process and all of our roles and responsibilities.

I started to shortlist the homes I liked, and Sri helped set up the in-house visit timing with the seller's broker. In a couple of weeks, I was able to finalize a home and updated Amar and Sri.

Amar then worked very hard during the contract process by placing me at the right spot, which allowed me to get the home. At this stage, the one crucial point is that even as I was willing to pay more for the house, Amar got me the home at a lesser price, which is incredible. It clearly shows his confidence in the field he is in, which is excellent.

I went with a bank which gave me pre-approval. However, due to the COVID situation, they could not approve my loan. At this point, I thought that I would lose this new home. However, Amar got me extra days from the seller's end, and at this point, I went with a different bank for the loan.

Amar did not lose hope, and he was under tremendous pressure for all sides. However, irrespective of being under pressure, he tried to handle everyone with compassion and calm nature. A few times, he even pushes people hard to make things happen on time.

Finally, I got my new home only because Amar and I and my family are always grateful for Amar Sri. Whoever is in the market now for home buying, I would strongly recommend Amar and team. He is a one-stop-shop and will go to heaven and earth to make it happen.

The service Amar is doing is incredible, and I wish him all the best and no way why no one can beat him, and he is the top realtor in our bay area.< /Text>< pics>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Name>Devaraj Kavali<//Name><text>I want to thank Amar and Sri for their efforts in helping us get the perfect home in a pleasant and right neighborhood with great schools. I want to share my wonderful experience working with Amar, Sri, and Amar's team. We are first-time buyers. Amar helped us to win the first offer with the best deal. It was pleasant talking to Amar when we met the first time. He explained the process very clearly and the steps involved, and Amar and Team executed the perfect execution. Amar is a great negotiator. He went above and beyond negotiating with all stakeholders to get the best deal for us. He has developed the best strategy dynamically based on the situation on the offer day and made our dreams come true.

Amar has come up with different stages and timelines in the entire process. He flawlessly executed all the steps way before the timelines we have put upfront. Amar is involved in all the stages starting from loan pre-approval and underwriting, escrow, insurance, warranty, and closing. Sri has always been there, guiding us throughout the entire process, explaining all the aspects, and suggesting what is best for us. Amar connected to the team to get the loan approval, who promptly responded and provided the best interest rate in the market and excellent additional benefits with Amar's influence. Amar helped to get the best insurance quotes and made us close the deal with less closing costs.

Amar and Sri are always available to guide us throughout the process and make the home buying process very smooth. I would highly recommend contacting Amar for a great home buying experience with the best deal.< /text>< gmapID>

<gmapID>0x808fbb3929619d47:0x86def5a5a9d84c50</gmapID><Review>Our recent home selling experience was smooth and flawless due to Amar’s services and high-notch professionalism. Moving out of state, especially during these COVID times, Amar’s guidance and attitude to go the extra mile, starting from preparing the house to closure, was commendable.

His timely and valuable suggestions on the upgrades and references to many great resources helped simplify the house preparation part.

Once the house is prepared and handed over to Amar, we are entirely off hands and don’t have to deal with any unknowns. Amar’s attention to the details during staging and advanced technologies in creating 3D view photos, floor plans, and other required documentation upfront helped provide more confidence to the buyers.

Most importantly, the offer was accepted and closed as planned with over $110K more than the listed price. Considering the last sale of a property in the neighborhood at a much lower value, the price we got is a giant leap forward. All this was possible only because of Amar’s extraordinary marketing efforts and networking. I highly recommend Amar for all your real estate needs.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< pics>

Amar and Sri make a fantastic home buying team. Amar is an excellent negotiator and closer. Sri gives incredible insights into all things leading up to choosing a home. For first-time homebuyers, especially in a fast-paced market like the Bay Area, it was superb having both on our side. We felt confident in the home searching process. We still remember having thousands of questions that both answered truthfully with accurate data, hand-holding us all the way.
Amar was able to negotiate $40k worth of savings and discounts on our new construction home! Both Amar and Sri went above and beyond to get our home which checked all of our requirements. We are extremely grateful to have found them for finding and buying our first home!<//review>

<Text>We have been looking for a new home in the bay area for around 2 years with no success. We decided to partner with Amar and Sri, since we had seen some of their past listings in our area.

It has been a great experience working with Sri and Amar, they have helped us through all aspects of the home buying process (e.g, mortgage, market analysis, closing process etc.) and helped us find a lovely home in Milpitas off the market.
It is not easy to get an off-market home in the bay area, given a crazy market, so we were very excited when they were able to negotiate a great deal for us.
We had a very challenging situation with the seller, and this is where having great realtor matters.
Sri and Amar kept us informed all along and managed the situation very effectively.

I wish I could have partnered with them sooner for my home buying needs.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

We were so fortunate to have found Sri and Amar as our Realtor. They helped us find the right house in the right neighborhood for the right price. Amar and Sri were patient as we looked at homes over several months and cautioned us about making unreasonable offers when we fell too quickly for any home that came our way.

In short, they were always on our side, working to make our house purchase as simple and successful as possible. The best part about working with Sri was that she was always more focused on answering our questions, giving us good advice, and finding homes that met our needs than closing a deal. We would strongly recommend Amar and Sri to anyone.

Amar is a great negotiator. When we thought that this is a seller's market and it would be impossible to purchase during these crazy times, he called us and said, Congratulations, guys! We did it! Once again, I will always recommend Sri and Amar to anyone interested in investing in real estate!< /review>

<name>Vinod Kumar< /name><Time>1600535081095<//Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>We firstly want to thank Amar, Sri, and Team for providing exceptional support and help in getting our new home. We have been thinking about an upgrade from our current home and had lots of questions and confusion before we started. We got Amar's contact from some previous conversations when we bought our first home four years ago. When we were looking for an upgrade, Amar came first to mind.

Listing current home:
We first set up an introductory call with Amar; given the COVID situation, we had a zoom call. Amar clearly explained the whole process of listing and buying a new home. Once we signed the listing contract, Amar sent out a detailed execution list with many steps to happen for the execution. Given it's a new experience for us, these execution steps were incredibly useful. Amar always emailed us about the progress on each step. After listing the house, we got offers without any contingencies within ten days and above the listing price. Overall it was a smooth process for us as a seller. Amar did most of the heavy lifting negotiating and bringing all involved parties and taking it to the finish line.

Buying a new home:
Once we had our listing sorted out, Amar introduced us to Sri, to help us find our next home. Sri has so many insights on the bay area and helped us choose the right neighborhood to look for, given our emphasis on schools and safety. Finally, after a very insightful conversion with Sri, we decided on the neighborhoods, and we went on our way to look for homes that we liked around the area. Once we sent out around ten listings that were to our liking, and then Sri went on to research those listings and filtered out the bad apples, which we were not aware of. Sri emphasized the long-term value of the home and took us on the right path to find our perfect home. Once we found the home we liked, then came the offer part. Before we put down the offer, Amar went over the disclosures and other paperwork and cleared out everything was good before proceeding further. The house we saw had multiple offers, and the way Amar and the team worked blew our mind. They are masters in negotiating, out of 5 other strong offers, they negotiated with the other listing agent. They helped us put a very good offer. And at midnight in the night (yes they work hard) after an anxious evening, we got a phone call from Sri and Amar, letting us know the good news that our offer was accepted. They made it look easy, but clearly, they went above and beyond to make sure we are doing the right thing.

Amar also helped us with his excellent team to get us the highly exceptional team starting from Financing, Home warranty, insurance, and others. End of the day, we feel great that we went with Amar and the team. Thanks again.</review>< Pics>

<Name>Saikat Kundu<//Name><Time>1620186468591< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>We decided to work with Amar after looking at his great reviews on Zillow.

He exceeded all our expectations. We were proud homeowners within a

month of our house search. As first-time home buyers, we had a lot of

questions about the process, location, and price. Amar and Sri patiently

answered all our questions. In the first meeting itself, Amar came up with a

clear plan on handling the entire home buying process. He helped us

understand that there are many aspects of the house that we need to look

at other than appearance.

In this market of multiple offers, getting the offer accepted is one of the

most challenging things. Sri helped us in getting quick appointments to tour the

houses that we were interested in. When we informed Sri that we liked one

of the houses, Amar went through all the inspection reports and

disclosures to ensure no red flags and massive repair costs

after buying the house. They provided their honest opinion on every

property that we selected. Now comes the most challenging part of how much

to offer for the home. Sri helped us a lot to suggest a price that will

improve our chances of getting the offer accepted and ensure that it’s within our budget.

With multiple offers on the house, including cash offers, the seller was

planning to go for counteroffers which could have raised the price of the

house even higher. At one point, we already lost hope. But Amar was able

to convince the seller’s agent that our offer was one of the best, and it was

accepted. I don’t have words to thank Amar for his hard work and effort.

Amar and Sri had been very friendly, responsive, and handheld us

throughout the home buying process. We made the right decision to work with Amar and Sri.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808fbb3929619d47:0x86def5a5a9d84c50< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I would say Amar and Sri is a perfect team to get right home at right price.
In the entire home buying process, Amar did guide us each milestone inuring the home buying process and got right people into the game at right time.

This made our home buying process pretty seamless. Amar has good area of expertise, knowledge and negotiation skills.
Even after closing the deal, Amar managed to get us 5K credit from seller. We are glad to choose Amar and definitely recommend Amar.</review>

<Review>I had a pleasant home buying experience with Amar as my agent. I had been looking at homes to buy for several months before I met Amar. After I met Amar, I became a home owner within a short few weeks. With real-estate websites giving all the information needed it might seem an agent is not absolutely needed. But in a challenging market it is very important to have someone like Amar as your real estate agent.
Main advantages when having Amar as your agent:
Amar brings in a team to take care of entire real estate transaction. You get a hassle free buying experience.
Amar is extremely committed. If he thinks that a property is suitable for his client, he will try his very best to get it while staying within the client’s comfort level.
Amar reputation for guaranteed results gives an extra edge when offers are close and works as a close team.
Amar being very proactive and focused execution gives a huge advantage in current challenging market environment.
Amar believes on establishing long term relationship with his clients. He is not someone who just vanishes after finishing the transaction. He really cares about his clients and wants to get the best deal that is suitable for them.
Amar will definitely help with his treasure trove of knowledge in real estate.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

When me and my wife started to consider buying a new home, Amar’s name came up as a highly recommended agent through multiple friends. In our first meeting, Amar went through all the steps of home-buying process and explained different parameters which we need to look at when analyzing any home.

Whenever we were interested in any house, Amar’s wife Sri was extremely thorough in finding out all the pros and cons of that house in a quick time. If not for Sri, we may have ended up bidding for a house which was attractive from outside but had certain health hazard issues. When we decided to bid on the house that we are currently living in, Amar made sure to get the house within our price limit and did not ask us to raise the price during the bidding process.

Also, the entire process from bidding to escrow and closing was completely smooth and there were no delays at any point from Amar’s side. He always tried to keep all the parties involved on their toes and prevented us from any stress. Overall, I would recommend everyone to consider Amar for an honest and smooth home-home-buying experience.<//review>

Wow!!! Amar and Sri are the best realtors. I am a first time home buyer in the bay area with minimal knowledge about the real estate market. I started off very vaguely with budget being the priority. First virtual meeting with Amar itself was very comfortable, he explained each step in detail, listened to what I needed, gave me pointers to what and how to decide about a property. Within a week we were able to get an awesome property in a good area, good neighborhood, good schools and all this within our budget. Amar and Sri were very active in closing every step on time and with absolute transparency. Amar and Sri are a great team who are honest and true professionals with a personal touch. They have good knowledge about the bay area and are experienced. I would highly recommend Amar to everyone who is thinking of buying a home. If you want a peaceful, transparent, honest and a happy home buying experience Amar is the guy. Thank you Amar and Sri you made our own home dream come true.</text>

Amar and Sri were true and trusted partners and advisers in our

successful home-buying experience. They have great insights on

the bay area real estate market and helped really narrow our

search to meet our specific home-buying objectives. Both Sri

and Amar are extremely systematic in their approach to helping

their clients by providing clear accountability at each stage of

the home-buying process. Sri provided deep insights into the

value of specific homes and correlated it to various aspects such

as neighborhood, schools, location, scope of appreciation,

rentability and helped provide a convincing and objective

comparison between the various options that fit our specific

criteria. Once we identified the home, Amar worked diligently

with us, even taking time outside office hours, to go over in great

detail the disclosures and ensuring that there were no red flags

on any of the technical (foundation, structure etc.) or the legal

aspects of the home and also helped us estimate any repairs

needed in the short term. When it comes to putting together a

winning offer and negotiation, Amar demonstrated his

excellence as one of the best in the industry! He was able to

negotiate a convincing offer and help us magically win the home

amidst an extremely competitive situation with multiple offers.

Beyond the buying process, Amar and Sri also work with an

expert group of professionals that we could leverage for various

associated needs like home insurance, warranty, property

management etc. They go above and beyond in clarifying every

aspect even after purchasing the home forming a long-lasting,

trusted relationship with us.

Overall, Amar and Sri are an awesome, winning couple and one

of the very best we have seen in the industry and strongly

recommend them for your home-buying needs!< /Review>

We were fortunate to find Amar and Sri for our home buying process. We were first time home buyers with very little knowledge about how to find the right place. As my wife was pregnant, we were in a desperate need to find a home to welcome our daughter and start a new life with her. It was such a crucial time for both of us but the entire process of home buying was priceless.

We came to know about Amar from online reviews. We first had a one on one session with Amar (highly recommended) where he explained the entire home buying process to us. Sri was very much involved with the initial shortlisting and gave us reasons for choosing a property vs not choosing it. She gave several insights which we otherwise would have struggled to get. This included critical viewpoints of some houses which we shortlisted.

After identifying our dream home within the first month, Amar and Sri put an aggressive offer to the seller on our behalf at a price we were very comfortable with. It was Seller’s first open house, they had many offers and weren't entertaining anyone until they met the price they wanted. But Amar had the perfect strategy planned out to win. Amar and his team literally worked day and night to win us the offer by convincing the seller.

Amar and Sri were personally involved in all areas like Escrow process, loan and to closing the deal. Their guidance was really helpful as not once we were skeptical about any decision that we took. They were always available any time of the day, whether after office hours or during weekends. I remember receiving emails at 4 am in morning with highly informative process updates.

Thank you Amar, Sri and the team for helping us secure our dream home and start a new phase of our life with our daughter. I would highly recommend you to anyone I come across who is in need of a buying agent for their home. Once again, thanks a lot for all your efforts, we are proud owners of our dream home now.< /text>

We were first time home buyers and we came to know about Amar & Sri from a close friend. Our home buying experience was a breeze just because Amar and Sri put their heart and soul in this whole process. From wanting to own a home to owning a home took just three weeks. On one Sun morning we met Amar and explained our requirements and limitations in buying a home. Being an expert realtor Amar quickly understood our requirements and guided us by providing valuable feedback on type of house we should target for our budget, areas we should target considering future market appreciation etc. On Mon evening we talked to Sri in detail. Sri with extensive knowledge in Bay Area neighborhood explained areas good for raising a family, areas with great neighborhood and good houses in market. On Wed Sri guided us to a house, this house met all our requirements, and the neighborhood was impressive. We quickly expressed our interest in this house to Sri. On Thu Amar took charge and guided in the bidding process. There were 11 bids for the house already. Being an expert strategist, Amar helped us bid 5% less than the least offer and negotiated to make this deal happen. So as a buyer we realized that a good buyer’s agent was not someone who can bid highest and win, but someone who can bid least, negotiate and win. On Fri, it was Diwali eve and we couldn’t be any happier, we had entered into contract with the Seller. On Diwali my friends told us that we were lucky in getting a good house for a lesser price. For an outsider it was luck since they did not see us work hard, but as an insider we attribute our good luck to Amar’s & Sri’s hard work. Without Amar’s homework on quality of construction, Sri’s understanding of our requirements and guidance to right home, neighborhood & area, and most of all Amar’s negotiation skills in bidding phase, we could not have owned this home. Next the loan processing had to be completed in just two weeks. Suited for our financial and closure situation, Amar guided us to the best lender for Escrow and Bank Loan process. The whole process of Legal and Bank work was executed by Amar, Sri and Team in a quick, effective and smooth fashion. By the end of three weeks, we had the keys to our new home and we were proud owners. I think we got lucky to work with Amar and Sri. Amar and Sri were not only our buying agent but also our mentors and friends in this whole process. Looking forward to getting guidance from and working with Amar & Sri. Vijay Kumar</Text>

<Date>1616971070074< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>We are so happy to write this review for Amar and Sri! We contacted Amar when we decided to buy the house, and we met in his office. Right away, we knew that he is the best realtor we have spoken to. He was very thorough in his process and explained to us all our options. We started seeing houses regularly, and Sri helped us understand the pros/cons of each of the houses. Finally, within four weeks of our house search, we put an offer which got accepted! Not just that, he negotiated $48k below the listing price through his exceptional skills. I had never heard of a single-family house going below the listing price in the bay area. Still, Amar made it happen so that we don’t go beyond our budget. He also provided extraordinary support during the closing process. We were first-time home buyers, so everything was new for us, so he gave us a step-by-step guide on what needs to be done.
I don’t think we could have had a better experience anywhere else. Amar and Sri are genuinely the most honest and best realtors I have seen.
Thank you, Amar and Sri, for the WOW experience in our buying process. I hope to work with you again in buying or selling more houses< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808fbb3929619d47:0x86def5a5a9d84c50<//gmapID></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Date>1615851890520< /Date><Review>Amar and Sri helped us get our very first home and boy that was a great experience! They helped us get past the "first time home buying expectations" of everything being new and shiny to actually looking at the potential and real estate value of a house when we were house hunting. Amar was very patient with us and helped us to fully consider all similar options available.
Once we decided to put an offer on this house, Amar and Sri helped us come to a price point which would give us the best chance of acceptance. Amar followed up with the seller agent all along after the offer was submitted. The sellers had some doubts about our financial situation given we had put the best offer possible and had not provided proof of additional funds to cover a situation like a low appraisal. Amar talked the seller’s agent through their doubts and assured them ours was the best and clean offer. Our offer was accepted in the first go! No counter offer, nothing! Amar has quite the negotiation skills!
Well, as the sellers had feared, the appraisal from Bank Of America came in lower by about 40K. Additionally over the same weekend the interest rates on housing loans went up, putting us in a tough spot. If we decided to go with another appraisal with another bank, that would mean getting a higher rate of interest. We did decide to go with Wells Fargo. Our agent was Yogesh Rane, who by the way was amazing as well. He got us an appraisal and loan approval within 4 days! The appraisal came in at 5K above the selling price and we were relieved. Amar used this situation to re-negotiate the price with the sellers, all in the background and brought the selling price down by 20K! Bringing the price down in this hot seller's market in the bay area is a feat only Amar could have pulled off. By the time we closed, we had already made 25K equity on the house!
While the mortgage application was being processed, Amar was in constant communication and kept all the parties in the loop. Amar coordinated the whole process of escrow and closing.
My wife and I had an amazing buying experience. We would love to work with Amar again if we are back in the market in the future.</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fbb3929619d47:0x86def5a5a9d84c50</Gmap_id><user_name>Aditya Rane</user_name>< pics>

I had a very good home buying experience with Amar and his team.  Amar is one of the few realtors who has a strong team for all aspects of home buying.  The whole process is well defined.  Amar and his team have a wealth of information and were accessible and available at every step of the process.

Amar can get the job done and can close the deal of any type and any size.  I would highly recommend Amar and the team to anyone looking to buy a property in the bay area.< /text>

Awesome, what an experience ... better than a roller coaster ride. I was little hesitant to sell my property during this pandemic and as well with respect to other homes selling less than expected but only because of my realtor Amar who was able to spearhead this project by able to sell my property at a better price and not less which was a great relief to me. I strongly suggest potential seller/buyer to talk to Amar to get a glimpse of how knowledgable and fast he is.

Thanks,

We would like to express our gratitude for all the service Amar and Sri put together in our home buying journey. We were overwhelmed to know that our offer was getting picked for the first time. The effort and tireless follow up they do for their clients is unbelievable. It was a streamlined process and so transparent in all the steps happening in the backend as well. They did a commendable job; kudos to their team. We strongly feel that our home dream came true only because of Amar and Sri. They both were there every time to answer all our doubts. More than being their client, we enjoyed their humble nature and friendly approach. They treated every client with great respect and care, no matter if they had a bigger budget or a lower budget. I would say they both hard to find personalities. I would love to recommend every single friend of ours to their service. I wish them all success in their future endeavor as well. Thank You, Amar and Sri!<//Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>Amar and Sri did a wonderful job in making our dream come true. Our home buying journey was hurdled. With every step of the way, with every difficulty we faced, Amar was there to help us out.

Sri's exceptional knowledge of neighborhoods in the bay area and the market history played a key role in helping us make an informed decision as this was our first time buying a house.

When we decided on the house that we wanted, we did not have a lot of room to make bids over the asking price. Amar skillfully handled the offer negotiations and we got into contract on a Sunday night at 11:30. Amar and Sri are completely committed to their clients and work tirelessly towards their benefit! I am glad to have partnered with such a team for our first home.</Review></record>

<text>We got in touch with Amar through Zillow, and that was the turning point in the house hunt that we were in for some time leading up to it.

Amar and the team were very proactive from the get-go. They enthusiastically walked us through the milestones and the expectations for the entire home buying process. Amar did not let the ongoing pandemic situation come in the way of the process. He set up frequent video calls to keep us up to do date on the proceedings, and he was available for text/call/email pretty much any time of the day.

I always felt that the whole team was still on top of things and understood our requirements and preferences. They provided invaluable tips and suggestions regarding the red flags while visiting a house. Their intricate knowledge of the neighborhoods and localities assisted us immensely.

Amar and the team have been in this business for quite a long time, and it shows in the network of contacts they have in the realty business. Once we liked a house, both Amar and Sri would get into action and dig deep into the disclosures and lay out the details in layman’s terms in front of us, making it very easy for us to budget for the move-in expenses, if any.

We ended up buying a house with the first bid that we made with Amar and the team. The house had more than 10 offers, and ours was not the highest offer for the home. But Amar and the team negotiated relentlessly and used their connections with the selling agent to pull it off for us.

They ensured that we stayed in the loop throughout the negotiation process and let us make an informed decision. We are pretty sure we would not have won the bid if not for Amar and the team.

Later, Amar was personally involved in connecting us with the lender, escrow, home insurance agent, and others at every stage through the closing process. He would follow up with each of the parties individually to ensure that we were on track for the closing date. He would frequently send us the updated tracker of the milestones throughout the process. It was a delight to have an agent who always had our back, which took a lot of load off us. He made the entire home buying experience a walk in the park.

Even after we moved into the house, he has been in touch with us, calling us frequently to check if everything was right. Post-move-in, he provided contact with his contractors for some home upgrades we wanted to do. Every contact that Amar has provided us has turned out to be extremely professional. That shows the dedication and hard work that the entire team has put in through the years to build a strong network.

We highly recommend Amar and team to anyone looking to buy a property, be it a first-time buyer or not. It has been a privilege working with Amar and the team. We look forward to our continued relationship in the future. Thanks, Amar, and team. You are the best!.<//text>< name>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>We got referred to Amar through a friend who had an enjoyable buying experience a couple of years ago. Ours was a complicated scenario as we wanted to sell our current home and then find a new one to buy. So, we needed a rent back and also had to find a home that meets our needs within this time frame. To say that Amar did a great job with both selling and buying will be an understatement. He helped us sell the home during the holiday/COVID times and got our dream home in the first attempt. I have worked with different realtors before, but Amar & Sri handle things differently. Few things that stand out are: 1) Before you start the process, expectations are set on what everybody's role is. So, there are no surprises. 2) Once you like a home, they will not leave any stone unturned until you get your offer accepted. 3) Amar's attention to detail - a few minor tweaks made to our offer helped us win the offer during the last minute. 4) Amar has a great team working for you and supporting you through the whole buying and selling process. We are so happy to have worked with Amar and strongly recommend Amar and team for your housing needs. Thanks< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

We got to know about Amar from one of our friends when we lost hopes in our house search. As first-time home buyers, we had several questions about the process, location, price, and many questions. I feel like we do not know the crucial things to look for in a house rather than the appearance. Amar and Sri answered all the questions we had, put up a clear plan on how we tackle the home buying process and executed it very well. They provided their honest opinion on every property that we selected. It helped us a lot in making an informed decision to write an offer. Amar goes out of his way to get us the best possible deal, and our case is a sheer example. Even though our offer was not accepted initially, Amar was very diligent in following up with Listing Agent. Amar acted quickly and accepted our offer as the first contract dissolved even though we were not the highest bidders. Amar and Sri had been extremely nice, responsive, and handheld us throughout the home buying process. We are pleased to make the right choice to work with Amar and Sri..

Amar and Sri are rockstars! This is the TEAM to go to if you aspire to have the best home. Where do I start? Well, let me start from the beginning. This is our second home. We did buy our first home with Amar's guidance. So we are aware of the home buying process, which can be stressful. Amar did go through the process before starting, and I understood a digital transformation and framework that I did not see during my first home purchase. This impressed me since being the best REALTOR in the country. Amar continually works on improving the process to make it seamless for his clients.
We were not in a rush as we have a home to live in and wanted to find the right next home. This is where my favorite support pillar comes in – Sri. She is just amazing. I can vouch that she is here for your best interest, and she doesn't care if she loses a deal. Sri always advises on the house based on your family needs – First-time buyer? Do you have kids? Are you looking for an investment or something you want to call home? Do you need a backyard? Will the house appreciate it? She will give her best opinion and looks out for you as if you are her family. That is what stands out. I was surprised when Amar asked about our opinion on a property. Sri replied before saying it is not the ideal property and continuing looking. That moved me. You can pick up your phone and chat with her as you would with your family. All you get is honesty.

Now we found our ideal home, and then comes the master negotiator – Amar. He won us the deal when people were willing to pay way more. This sometimes looks unreal but trust me – THIS IS TRUE. He presents your value in both financial and emotional terms – That is what closes deals. You either pay a lot more and buy or pay just the right and complement other intangibles that Amar brings and win. You decide!

Now, after we won the deal, Amar, as always, signs up for fast closure. We wanted to close this in 25 days, given Christmas, New year holidays and the ongoing pandemic. Nothing Stops AMAR and his team. He has the best team to get everything in place. We did have few challenges in closing on time – I won't go into details – but Amar assured me not to worry. He said that this is his family's deal and he would close it on time. And guess what, he did. I told him I would want to close it on 01/8 as it is an auspicious day. He made sure that we had the notary come in on the day for our signature, and he recorded it the same day and gave us the key. This is unprecedented given the pandemic.

I want to reiterate that I will always BUY or SELL only with Amar, and I recommend you all to do the same. I always say that Amar is a sponge – He absorbs all the pressure and makes sure you enjoy the home buying process. I enjoy working with this GREAT team!< /Review>

My home buying experience with Amar was exceptional! I had the opportunity to work with Amar and Sri and their excellent team. I honestly thought that I would get approved for the loan. After relentless efforts of providing documents after documents, I was in awe of not getting the loan approved. I was sad and annoyed, and then comes the rescue time for me when I came across Amar information through Zillow. Right from my first connection with Amar, I knew in my heart that my dream of buying a home would come true. Within days of working with Amar and his team, I was approved for my loan, and thereby, my house hunting journey started. Sri made an exceptional effort in letting us know of the good schools and the area that will be best for my kids in the long run and me. I was able to secure a house within a month and a half of working with Amar, and that too during covid. There are so many steps into the home buying process. Amar and his team made an extraordinary effort to negotiate and win the house. They also made sure that the price is right, which I came to know after my house appraisal. Amar made sure that we achieved our key milestones during the home buying process, and the experience was smooth. I am so grateful to Amar and the team. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to buy a house in the bay area!< /text>

Overall it’s been a very pleasant experience with Amar in buying our first home. I appreciate the time Amar spent coming to the show the property more than one time and over phone explaining all the issues related to the real estate transaction. For a first time buyer like me, lot of things were new.

Amar was very prompt in responding and kept me posted regularly about the progress of the short sale and the closing of the escrow. I am impressed the way Amar handled the situation with the seller agent when the appraisal value came short of the offer price. Amar is very optimistic, knowledgeable in the local real estate market, friendly, easily approachable, patient and work towards the best interests of his clients.

Amar is willing to spend lot of time with your clients to understand the needs and the individual situation. Amar also was in regular touch with the bank agent to make sure that loan process was going smoothly and made sure that I got good deal on the loan also.

Overall, I am satisfied about the buying experience with Amar as agent and I strongly recommended him to my friends.

Thank you very much Amar for all your help, guidance and support through the entire process of buying our first home.<//review>

I appreciate the time Amar spent coming to the show the property more than one time and over phone explaining all the issues related to the real estate transaction.

<rating>5</rating><Text>Thanks a ton, Amar and Sri, for helping us to get our dream home. We sincerely appreciate taking care of things like family, starting from guiding us to the right home till we move in. It is our pleasure to share our home buying experience.

We started looking for houses through online portals, and that is how we came across Amar's profile in Zillow. After finding reviews on multiple online platforms about Amar, we decided to choose him as our Realtor. We contacted Amar in October 2020, through a phone call. Amar promptly replied to our call and set up a meeting the same day. He explained to us in detail about the home buying process. We were impressed in the first call itself, seeing how thorough he is and how he laid out his plans. We knew that we had chosen the right person.

Sri explained to us in detail about the market and how we should select the homes. She had an excellent understanding of the location and knew the value of homes in that particular area. She also explained to us how the value changes over the years. Sri helped us in narrowing our search. Sri made us realize that we shouldn't just look at the home's interior, but it is equally important to look at other aspects of the home.

Once we found our dream home, Amar was at the forefront, making a strong case for our offer, whereas Sri was working with us and walking us through everything that we needed to know. Given the number of offers that home had, we weren't expecting to win the bid. But to our surprise, Amar called us and informed us that our offer was accepted. The Seller accepted our offer. It's all because of Amar's strong persuasive skills and internal connections with sellers.

Amar has a great team, starting with the lender who gave us the home's best mortgage rate. The insurance agent, the home warranty agent, the escrow agent, etc., all of them were quick to jump in and help us. Amar's team helped us close the deal within 3 weeks, even during the pandemic and holiday season in November. Overall it took less than 1.5 months for the entire process. Amar was keen on following up with everyone involved in the whole process. He frequently updated us on the status. His management skills were commendable.

Overall the whole process was very smooth. Amar and Sri executed the plans perfectly and were personally involved in every activity. They involved us in every step, and the entire process was very transparent to us. They were readily available whenever we called them. We would highly recommend Amar and Sri for all your home buying process, especially for first time home buyers.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Amar and Sri are amazing professionals who truly care about what your requirements are and propose the listings which they really think of value. They are not shy in letting you know that the listing you might have like need not be of good value in the future.
Amar had did lot of research for our house purchase and also had worked on through the overall documentation needed for us to get approved by Bank Of America within 2 weeks! He was able to get us the perfect bid at a great purchase price!
Sri is really helpful in making sure we have received all the information + property related stuff.
They followup regularly to see how you are feeling overall in the new house and happy to help if needed!
Definitely recommend them to our family and friends!< /review>< Resp>

When I inquired in my network for a realtor, whom I can count upon for buying a dream home, few names came up; among all, Amar and Sri stood out on the list. Soon after, I met Amar in person and was amazed by his background as a techie, in-depth knowledge of the local market, genuine care for their clients, willingness to go the extra mile to help first-time buyers like us. Amar and Sri have been very instrumental in looking at the property from various angles (value proposition, neighborhood, school district, and what not) and steering us towards winning our dream home through the right strategy, best negotiation by all possible means, flawless execution, and personally involved in every step of the process(Escrow, Mortgage, Home Insurance/Warranty, Closing, Referrals for remodeling contractors/Re-Keying and the list goes on and on) from scheduling the tour of the property to scheduling the house warming ceremony. It was a one-stop solution for all Real Estate needs, and I am glad I was in the right hands. Honestly, I couldn't thank Amar and Sri enough for going the extra mile to make this entire process so pleasant and seamless. One of the best decisions I made to work with you. You exceeded all our expectations. I firmly believe this collaboration will last long. We would highly recommend Amar, Sri & his entire team searching for the right home per your need, collaboration in making an informed decision, proper deal negotiation, flawless execution, and seamless experience throughout. Thank you, Amar and Sri, You are the BEST in the valley!<//text>

It's my first time working with Sri and Amar for buying investment properties. I had the down payment for two properties but was not entirely sure that I would qualify for two loans if I had to buy the two properties simultaneously. It's a unique scenario where Sri and Amar made their critical impact.

Sri gave thorough guidance about neighborhoods that suited my needs. She explained in detail why specific areas are better than others. When I was bidding, Sri advised me not to go overboard and explained why. It was because Amar had used his extensive connection with the agents networking and reputation. Amar convinced the listing agent that I was the best buyer and made my offer look like an all-cash offer. He was able to negotiate the best deal for me in the face of a higher offer. The second place where Amar made the most crucial difference was in executing both the loan closures. When one of the loan agents had issues with getting the loan closed, Amar spoke to the loan agent, their manager, the underwriter, and their manager. He was able to bring the various parties involved to the table and sign off the loan within a time period he had set. I believe this was the most challenging part of the entire process. Amar personally was on top of it to make sure both the loans closed as planned even when one was faltering and getting delayed. During the critical phase, he was overseeing the loan closure, the escrow process all the way to recording the property. He was on top of every process to ensure all of them ended smoothly with minimum disruption to my activities.<//review>

Amar was recommended to us by a friend. We were already in the market looking for a house (put in offers for a couple of houses without success) before we switched to Amar/Sri. We put in an offer and got accepted all within 2 days from when we got introduced to them. We would not have got our house without the diligence and effort of Amar/Sri. Right from the start, we knew that we are dealing with consummate professionals. Amar and Sri are very methodical and have clearly well-defined roles and expectations. The whole process was a well-executed project with milestones/deadlines etc. The icing on the cake was us getting the house despite not being the highest $ bid. Fo buying a house in the hot bay area market, we needed an edge over other offers, Amar/Sri gave us that edge.<//review>

4th real estate transaction with Amar and Sri team, but it's my first time I've partnered with a close friend to buy this property for investment purposes. Given this partnership arrangement, I want everything to go well right from the start. It was an easy decision for me to go with Amar and Sri again because I trust them and their unique ability to find exceptional properties, coupled with proven execution skills.

I convinced my friend that we should go with Amar. I set up an intro meeting just three months back. I requested Amar to help us find a great investment property, given our new partnership. As an investor, you need a trusted partner. Amar's attention to detail, knowledge of the local market quickly impressed my friend. We decided to go with Amar to maximize the returns in a short time.

Amar and Sri reached out to us a few weeks back following our initial conversation. They shared with us about this investment property that would meet all our needs and told us that they would buy this property themselves and asked if we are interested in it. As soon as I heard about their interest, we quickly put an offer within 24 hours of our conversation. The next day Amar did his magic and closed the deal, which helped us to buy this property $100K LESS than the market value in the best neighborhood of Milpitas!

It is hard to find someone like AMAR and SRI who genuinely care about his client's needs and protect your interest in every way possible. Amar's advice and guidance through this process were invaluable. We can't wait to do another transaction through this partnership.</Text>

First, thanks a ton for helping us own our first home in the US in an extremely competitive bay area. We are incredibly grateful to you.

Since the beginning, Amar set up multiple calls even during these COVID times. He had put in special care and effort to understand the hone owning processes and milestones even before we started the process. He was extremely patient and understanding to answer all our questions and concerns and gave us appropriate guidance.

Sri has been of generous support and was extremely helpful throughout the process as well. Especially for us, since it was the first time we were undertaking a big life decision. She took the time to carefully review all the houses we sent and give feedback on why the property works or doesn't work for our needs and helped us understand home values and factors impacting it. She was available throughout the process at all times. She scheduled visits keeping the COVID situation in mind. She made sure all the necessary precautions were taken at each visit. She was always helpful in guiding us throughout the experience.

Amar is extremely knowledgeable about the technical aspects. Once we finalized the house and wanted to go ahead, he was extremely proactive in offers and negotiations. He made our dream come true even if there was a $35,000 difference in the counter-offer price. The counter offers were quick, and the most efficient part was we didn't raise the price even in counters offers. Amar helped get us inspection reports and took time to schedule a call to explain every page of the report patiently. Even after the offer acceptance, he was always on top of all the processes. Amar was updating us at every single step.

We are extremely happy with Amar and Sri and definitely will share our experience with all our friends. We will surely recommend Amar to anyone thinking about a home purchase because they are incredibly efficient and knowledgeable agents. They are excellent people and very passionate about what they do and love to help people from the bottom of their hearts.

Thank you for everything.< /Text>

We want others to know the beautiful experience we had buying our home with Amar and his amazing team. They helped us buy our home on our terms.
We were shopping around, not very serious when we started but we never felt pressured to buy or bid at a specific price. We also got good advice on the price point we should bid to get home.
The house was a fallout of escrow at $1080000 and the appraisal at $1080000. The same house Amar negotiated for $1040000 when the listing of the house was $1048000. Amar managed to get the property below listing price. However, they had multiple offers and craziness happening in the current real estate market.
Sri, on the other hand, helped us understand the Bay Area market, neighborhoods, things to consider before looking into the property. She is very knowledgeable about all the areas in the bay. Any listing we were interested in, she immediately knew the property along with its pros and cons. She was very accurate with each property that came to the market and knew exactly what we were looking for. She was there in every step, and calmly explained every question we had related to the property.

Amar is a retired engineer. He had everything documented in an excel sheet with things to take care of when buying a property. It had to do what, like the lender's responsibilities, insurance details, our responsibility, and things Amar and Sri had to do after the offer was accepted. Including selecting the best home insurance and other things.

Buying a new home is a daunting process, and they made us feel comfortable, made the whole process seamless. Amar and Sri are very responsive and prompt. We would highly recommend them as a realtor.< /text>

We want to thank Amar and Sri for providing exceptional support and help in getting our new home. Being a first-time home buyer, it's very challenging to understand all the market dynamics, especially in the pandemic situation surrounded by a high/ hot seller's market in the Bay area.

We got in touch with Amar through a referral from one of our friends who had a very positive home buying experience dealing with Amar. In the beginning, Amar explained to us all the steps of home buying in great detail. Also, he identified responsibilities for all of us during every step of the process. He expedited processes of loan pre-approval by introducing us to a loan officer from Wells Fargo.

Meanwhile, we had a detailed discussion with Sri about our preferences, budget, and choices. I must say – Sri has in & out in-depth knowledge of every South Bay neighborhood as she would explain us advantages (like appreciation, school ratings, diversity) and disadvantages (like creek related issues, nearby transformer lines, big parking garages, bad shops around, commercial properties in the area) of a neighborhood by just listening to the address. She was very patient and easy to talk throughout all the discussions and meticulous in ensuring all of her clients are safe while arranging home visits during COVID time. We liked her extra efforts to know the client's needs and building that close relationship.

We started the process in the beginning of August; we visited 4 houses (of course, browsed and drove through hundreds) and decided to put our first offer in the last week of August. Amar went the extra mile in locking an excellent deal for us by negotiating very hard and making a great offer for the seller. We were surprised that our offer got picked though there was an all-cash offer on the table. This was all because of Amar's dedication, enthusiasm, and a solid understanding of market dynamics based on his vast experience as a Realtor. He was transparent throughout the process and put all the effort into making sure we are getting a great deal in terms of money and the quality of the house. Once the offer is accepted, Amar made the next steps easy. He worked with the loan officer, escrow officer, selling agent, appraisal officer, and insurance agent. Amar works with an exceptional team - I took quotes for loans and insurance from 3 4 different banks/ companies. However, nothing could beat what was offered by Amar's team!! That was solidifying our belief that we are working with the right set of people. Throughout all the steps, Amar followed up with the respective people to make sure everything is on track and kept updating us.

We are done with all the steps and are proud owners of a beautiful house in total 7 weeks, and that's all possible because of Amar & Sri!! We would highly recommend their services as they made the entire process smooth, transparent, fast, and (little) stress-free.<//Review>

<review>We were recommended to Amar by a co-worker. My co-worker's actual words were, "If you are looking for a home, Amar is the guy! He will make sure you will get the best home". That feedback held true.  We brought our first home with the help of Amar and the team. It took us literally one weekend of showing, and two days later, we had won our first bid ever.   Amar is extraordinarily detail-oriented. He has a step-by-step process charted out, which he will explain+share with you after the first time you meet. It was beneficial for us as we were first time home buyers. It helped us understand the different milestones in the process we were going to cover. He also helped us finalize our zip code. We had five different towns we were interested in, and they all were in different county's. Amar's real estate investor experience is precious here. He gave great insights, which led us into nailing down to only two towns. Before meeting Amar, this same elimination process was very tough, confusing, and even bad choices, I feel, from an investment perspective.   From there, Sri guides with the pan out view of how great these homes you narrowed are, and which ones you should place bets on, also which ones you should let go. Sri is in constant touch during this process.   For us, we were lucky. We spoke to Amar Thursday, Friday we sent a list of our top 5 homes. Sat/Sunday, we viewed 3 of our top 5, and Wednesday, we bid and won the bid.   If you reside in the Bay Area, you must know how challenging the home buying process is. It's expensive and very competitive bidding wars. We did not have the strongest bid. But by Amar's magic, we won the bid.   Amar and Sri are a great team - very aggressive, dedicated, focused, and passionate real estate agents. He gives his best and gets the home you love. You can rely on Sri and Amar.   Amar also lines up the Escrow and other technical details like home loan and insurance after winning the bid. They are the best deal you will get. We learned that doing the homework of scouting it for ourselves and realized the best value is what Amar had lined up.   Lastly, we brought our home during the lockdown. Sri informed us of all the protocols to follow to make it safe.   All in all, it was a smooth home buying sailing process.< /review>< Pictures>

In my 13 years of home-buying, Amar is the only person I would really consider as a true Realtor. After going through my experience, I do not have any doubt that he delivers the best results to his clients whether you are buying or selling homes. Amar is very knowledgeable and really enjoys being in the Realty business and brings about the best qualities. A few big thiings that he brings to his clients are:

a) His network for Lending
b) His relationship strategy with agents from the other side.
c) His negotiation skills
d) He takes care of all the needs along the way
e) He explains the whole process and maintains profiles and provides a lot of information and steps.

All in all, you have to experience your home buying with Amar to understand what I mean.</review>

<text>We would highly recommend Amar as Real Estate Consultant to anyone desiring to buy, or sell a home in the Bay Area and would highly recommend Amar as a consultant to anyone interested in learning more about their Real Estate options – investment, short sale, foreclosures properties.

Amar has broad and deep Real Estate knowledge and very strong negotiating skills. He can navigate any Real Estate situation fairly for all parties. Amar is very pleasant, professional, and easy to work.

It was clear from our first meeting that he was a good listener, intent on finding the home we envisioned, and had an incredible amount of experience and local knowledge. Amar has an intimate understanding of different neighbourhoods, schools, and local issues as well as the current market conditions. During our search he was very flexible with meeting and viewing times as well.

Once we found the right property, his expertise was invaluable in negotiating the contract and closing escrow. As our Agent, Amar helped us to buy our current home in a competitive multiple offer situations.

As first time home buyers, we were learning as we go and Amar was a terrific guide, answering all of our questions and steering us away from potential problems. Our buying experience could not have been better”</text>< Time>

Amar is a great negotiator. Because of his negotiation skills, our offer was accepted even though it was not the best offer for the seller. Amar used the right strategy focusing on our strengths, and as a result, we were able to win the house. Both Amar and Sri were easily accessible, and just an email/call/text away. Being first time home buyers, we needed much help, and they always kept us informed and helped us make the right decisions.

There are many complicated steps in the process: loan approval, home insurance, home warranty, escrow, and closing. They were personally involved in every step. They helped us get the best possible service. With their help, we were able to get a low-interest rate from a well-known lender. They even helped us get the best possible insurance and warranty policy. The escrow process also went super smoothly.

They worked tirelessly in the background for our success, ensuring that we do not have to worry about anything. In my opinion, it was a perfect execution, and I would highly recommend Amar and Sri.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Amar & Sri are a great team. They are the best realtor if you are serious at housing market in the competitive bay area. We have worked with them multiple times now and every single time they beat their own performance!

Sri is very knowledgable about the housing neighborhood and always comes up with great locations. She has spent a number of years in the prime market and has a great knack at suggesting locations.

Amar is very professional and through with the whole home buying and selling process. He takes the stress and anxiety in this process, especially in such a hot bay area market. His negotiations are unbelievable. He has always got us the deal, and that too at a price favorable to us.

Amar & Sri are family to us and we would keep going to them for any advice and help with our home needs. We strongly recommend to anyone who is looking to find their home and make their dreams come true.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>My wife and I had the pleasure of being introduced to Amar in Feb 2020 by an acquaintance of ours who had previously worked with him. Even before the first discussion, we got a really good feeling regarding his expertise by glancing at the numerous glowing recommendations on LinkedIn. During our first meeting, Amar took the time to patiently explain the home buying process and the current housing market situation. The key process steps and responsible stakeholders were defined early on! As first time home buyers with a young infant, this was invaluable for us and helped us save valuable time. Then we were put in touch with Sri Amar, who has a wealth of information regarding locality and background information. While we had to put a brief pause in our house search due to COVID-19, Amar and Sri were super understanding and emphasized that safety was first. They helped us to focus on the right area, which met most of our criteria. As we restarted the process in June, they were responsive and provided a lot of guidance. We did many drive-around (due to Covid-19). Sri Amar provided almost instant feedback on the choices homes we were interested in. She guided us in aspects that we did not even think about – like avoiding busy areas because we had a young one! The offer process itself was a unique experience. We were able to get a private viewing of our future house 10 hours before offers were due! With a lot of timely discussions with Amar and Sri, we were able to pull all of the info needed to get a good offer in! The fact that our offer was accepted when there were better/cash offers on the table is a testament to Amar's negotiation skills (total of 13 offers). He fought for us so passionately when even we had given up hope, exhibiting his professionalism at the highest level. Even Amar remarked that this was one of his toughest negotiations in recent times, and he came out on top! (It was a Relocation transaction and very challenging in many ways). When we saw the email at around midnight congratulating us on our offer being accepted, we could hardly believe it! Our future home awaited us, where we would see our son grow up! If all of this was not enough, Amar's most reliable trick was saved for last. His amazing network of crucial people for the closing process is mind-boggling! He was able to introduce us to the right Mortgage Agent, Insurance Agent, etc. Amar personally oversaw the process and ensured all of the points of contact reacted accordingly so that we could close on time! He and his team also ensured that we were kept in the loop for all decisions, really ensuring that we worked together. Even after closing, he continued to support us with key contacts for the locksmith, utility changeover, security, etc. In the end, it worked out for us that we were able to work with Amar! I would highly recommend him and his team to anyone looking to buy (or sell), as they get the job done! We will certainly be returning to Amar for our future needs.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating><user_id>118244091168248600859< /user_id><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808fbb3929619d47:0x86def5a5a9d84c50< /gmapID></record>

<Review>I have received Amar's contact from one of my friend, and I have scheduled some time and met him in his office. We had a detailed discussion, patiently clarified all my queries, and explained how the bay area market is.

Amar has started sharing me house listing based on various requirements starting from schools, locality, house models, etc.

On every step, Amar/Sri was answering all my queries very patiently. If it were someone else, they would have run away. Amar also helped me in connecting with the right lender who has good domain understanding.

Amar and Sri are always available to clarify any questions, and they have been sincere in each step. Amar had very strategic thinking and knew how to negotiate the detail. This was my first house in the bay area, and the market here is very competitive. Amar and Sri have helped in crafting the best proposition that would keep other competitors far behind.

All in all, Amar & team is a One-Stop solution for any home buyers.</Review>< Pictures>

I wanted to take this time to thank Amar for the enormous support and expertise he provided us. We are not first time home buyers for either a primary or investment home and have dealt with multiple house purchases and realtors during the last decade. Normally and understandably this can be a very difficult and often nervous time for a lot of people but our experience was absolutely positive.

Right from the beginning, Amar provided us with a wealth of information about the neighborhood that immediately showed great investment potential. He used his great people/negotiation skills to secure the property for us at below asking price when there were multiple offers on the table. His tie-ups and constant checking with mortgage broker helped us keep the loan processing on track with a closing in 21 days! Even in situations where he did not have a prior working relationship with people (for example, he worked with new people in the Title Company), he was able to use his great negotiation skills to influence the situation in our favor. Also, in the process he forges new relationships that will help his clients further.
Thanks

Thank you, Amar & Sri, for helping us get our dream home. When we first contacted Amar in May, we were clueless about the home buying process. Without his help and guidelines, we could not have reached this milestone.

We were doubtful if it was the right decision to buy a house amidst the pandemic and Shelter-in-place. After talking to Amar about our concerns and expectations, he gave us a clear picture of the process. He explained all the steps and how he and Sri will be involved in each step. He connected us to a lender who could close the sale in 21 days. We realized this is important for sellers to close the house in as little time as possible.

Sri helped us find our perfect home. She guided us to find a home that fit our current need and will also be a good investment for the future. We realized that there is much more to a home than newly remodeled cabinets and kitchen. It is all about LOCATION! There were many evenings when we talked for hours about different properties. She gave us clear insight into why some properties are not right for us.

Finally, we found a property with everything that we looked for, and Sri gave us the green flag. Amar explained the disclosures of the house very well to us. He presented a clean offer to the seller and negotiated a good deal for us by working around the clock. We got the house with new furniture all at list price, which was 30K less than what the seller expected.

Even after moving into the house, Amar and Sri continued to help us to sort out everything. We are grateful to have known them, and we appreciate all their efforts in helping us land in a beautiful home.< /review>

<text>My husband and I had a great experience working with Amar and Sri. We were looking for our 1st home in the Bay area. Being a first time home buyer, we were extra cautious looking for a Realtor who could help us in our journey to find our dream home. That’s when we came across Amar and Sri. We just contacted them through Zillow, and immediately we got the confirmation of our first e-meet. Amar’s first email started with a line, “HOMEOWNERSHIP is the partnership and commitment between the Realtor and Buyer.” This resonated with us a lot. That’s when we realized we had picked the right people to work with.

Amar walked us through the entire home buying process step by step. He put together an extremely organized strategy with his Real Estate partner Sri. He was thorough with the entire process starting from market research until closing. He emphasized on TEAMWORK and ensured everyone’s contribution were on time to close on our dream home.

Sri would discuss every house we came across in the market and point out the pros and cons of them. She was always so cheerful yet very technical. She patiently worked with us to choose the right home in terms of its value. She went deep into knowing what exactly we are looking for and intersected with her vision of what we should be looking for in terms of the value of a property, its locality, and other technical aspects.

Amar and Sri did a wonderful job explaining the initial disclosure and eventually helping us put together a good offer. He did a fantastic job negotiating with the seller, thereby keeping everyone happy. Amar and team were personally involved in all areas viz. Escrow process, Loan, and closing. It was sheer teamwork and their experience that helped us to finish the entire process from finding the right home until close within 22-23days.

We thoroughly enjoyed working with Sri and Amar, and we would highly recommend them to anyone without hesitation.<//text></record></dataset><record>

We started looking to buy a new home last September, and the first step was to search for a good or rather best realtor in the bay area. Looking for an excellent, aggressive realtor as we did not have a pleasant experience with our prior realtor when we bought our previous home.

I spoke to Amar, and we instantly connected. Amar has in-depth experience in every aspect of home buying. As soon as I started the conversation, we were able to discuss many things as he would understand buyer's requirements very quickly. He would make strong recommendations on how we should proceed. Also, Amar was very proactive in suggesting how we should rent our previous home and was very helpful in understanding the rental market. These suggestions are unbiased in any manner. I still remember our first meeting with Amar. We discuss many things which would take several meetings with any other realtor ( in my opinion and experience).

Once we decided on the budget and location with Amar's inputs, the formal and professional process started from Amar's team, which first started with Sri Amar. Sri Amar is immensely down to earth and understands every aspect of home buying, just like Amar. Sri Amar makes sure to filter the homes based on our preference. There were instances where I would ask Sri Amar if a particular home is worth visiting. Sri Amar would make sure to get into the details and see if the house is worth visiting. She said NO to many such homes before we found our home.

Sri/ Amar had to make the offer to our current home very aggressively during holiday times (December). We are traveling internationally. Sri/ Amar ensured to work very closely with the sellers and us, negotiate it very aggressively, and get us a good deal.

After winning the offer, the next steps executed an optimal way until we got the keys to our new home.

I must say Sri and Amar are great at what they do and are very professional with a personal touch to everything they do :) :)

It was a great pleasure working with Sri and Amar. If anyone wants seamless home buying experience - now you know whom to go to :) Sri and Amar realtors. Thank you, Sri and Amar.< /review>

My name is Manohar; I never thought I could have my dream home in the Bay area with a 5% down payment with good neighborhood & schools. Then my friend introduced me to Amar & Sri.

Amar walked me through his 5 steps process; I was very much impressed with the process. After a few weeks, we liked a home in a great neighborhood & Schools; I had no hopes that the seller would accept my offer as there were higher offers with a 20% down payment. Then I received a message from Amar & Sri saying that the seller has accepted my offer.

Amar & Sri had done superb negotiation with an excellent strategy to get our offer accepted. Our whole family is very much thankful to Amar & Sri.

We want to give 5 stars Rating to Amar & Sri work in the below areas:

1.   THE BEST DEAL Negotiation by ALL possible means
2.   PERFECT EXECUTION of the process
3.  Winning HOME with RIGHT STRATEGY
4.   PERSONALLY involvement in ALL areas of home BUYING
5.   COLLABORATION in informed decision making
6.   PROCESS GUIDANCE throughout Home BUYING PROCESS
7.   Staying on TOP of EVERY activity in the whole process to make sure
the end goal accomplished as smoothly as possible.
8.  FOLLOW UP after we moved into a new home to check if we need any
help.< /Review>

Would HIGHLY recommend Amar and his team, especially if you want someone who will go above and beyond for you, someone who truly knows what they are doing, and someone who truly cares about you as individuals. He has a truck load of experience, immense confidence, highly talented in his job - he is the companion you are looking for if you want to do any real estate transaction in bay area.

Thanks, Sumith.< /text>

Buying an investment property with partnership is not an easy decision. It requires sound thinking on the location, price and prospect of the property.

Amar helped me to take this decision, supported from the beginning. Made good deal with the builder using his strategy, knowledge and closed within a short period. His persistence follow-up with builder and between the partners is very admirable from bottom of my heart.

Amar made dream come true.<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Amar has been very clear in the process of home buying. In our first meeting itself, he explained every step in detail. We loved his work ethic, where we established that Sri, Amar, and we all need to agree to go ahead with the offer. Amar and Sri were always available to have a word and answer any questions that we have. They made sure we completely understand and are satisfied with the answers. We were impressed by Sri’s knowledge of the neighborhoods and the investment perspective she gave us. She poured her heart to make sure we were buying the right home for the best price. It gave us so much confidence in our decision to buy home. We were stunned by Amar’s negotiation skills, and because of it, we were able to beat the cash offer and win our dream home. Amar has an excellent team. Everyone stayed on top of their responsibility in closing this deal on time. I will recommend Amar and Sri to all my friends interested in buying a house as they will be in safe hands. We sincerely appreciate all your efforts in winning the best deal and home for us. Thank you so much, Amar and Sri.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Name>Na Tr< /Name><Date>1584912260562< /Date><rate>5<//rate><text>Home buying is one of the big financial decisions and can be overwhelming especially for first time home buyers like us. Amar and his wonderful team made us at ease right from the time we stepped into his office to get started on the home buying journey.

Client First:

For Amar client always comes first. We initially had a lot of questions that Amar and Sri helped answer with utmost patience and explained the entire process. They gave us valuable information which helped us narrow down on the neighborhood and to create a checklist on features that we would like in potential homes we were looking at. What I liked most was giving us space to make the choices at our own convenience and not making us feel pressurized to make an offer. They were always available for a phone call at any time of day. Speaking to Amar you can tell how experienced he is in the home buying process and effort he puts to meet each of his client’s needs.

The Art of Negotiation:

Bay area is one of the most competitive real estate markets and requires a very dynamic real estate agent for deal negotiation. Amar fits the bill perfectly going far and beyond to help negotiate a deal for his client. He puts his complete effort to devise a unique strategy to approach each bidding process, talking to seller agent to understand the needs of the seller and how best he can put forward an offer that will be a winning one. He never pushes the client to put in offer more than what they feel comfortable with and informs the client of all the details to help the client make an informed decision before making a offer. Once the offer has been put forward, he works with the seller agent to make sure any questions of the seller are addressed and providing them a guarantee that they will close the contract in agreed upon terms.

Excellent Process:

He follows a well-defined process that he has developed over years. He has an excellent team that work with him closely to close the contract in very timely manner. He always remains on top of things keeping the client informed throughout the entire process and executes it to perfection. He is also willing to accept feedback in his process, and he is continuously trying to improve.

Amar was referred to us by one of our friends and we are happy that we decided to go with Amar as our realtor. Our entire home buying experience was a very pleasant one and less stressful than I imagined to be. I would highly recommend Amar as realtor for anyone looking for a real estate agent to buy/sell a home.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Being the first generation in the US, we were clueless about the essential steps to consider before entering the market. We are glad that we met Amar during one of the open houses. After meeting Amar and going through various stages, we felt completely relaxed knowing that there will be an expert who can provide us with the right guidance. Sri has guided us various times in helping us make the correct decision in choosing the right home in a prime location where home value is appreciated. Amar has helped us in going through the disclosure documents and explained to us thoroughly. There were many higher offers than ours, and we completely lost hope, but Amar has negotiated well and helped us win the home of our dream. Amar and his team were always available to answer any questions. They were a great help throughout the home buying process, including getting the pre-approval to getting the house key. Buying a home is a big decision, and going through the entire process could be tedious. However, Amar has made the whole process very smooth. We felt like we had a family member by our side in this journey rather than a realtor. We will recommend Amar and Sri to everyone.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

We
came to know of Amar from a few references and online reviews. We first had a 1:1 session with Amar when he explained the whole home buying process. Sri was very much involved with the initial shortlisting and gave us reasons for choosing a property vs not
choosing it. She gave several insights which we otherwise would have struggled to get. This included critical viewpoints of some houses which we shortlisted. After identifying our dream home within the first month, Amar and Sri put an offer on our behalf.
The seller had many offers and wasn’t entertaining anyone until they met the price they wanted. However, Amar was able to get information from the seller on what they wanted. It’s critical information to make informed decision. The seller were a bit adamant
on the price they wanted but Amar was able to negotiate to a level which was a win-win for both sides. After our offer was accepted, Amar and his team helped to close the deal within the stipulated time we had put in the contract. When I had to travel abroad,
he worked with my wife to ensure things weren’t left on the wayside and make progress and close the house on time.

Overall it was a great experience working with Amar and Sri and we recommend them to aspiring first-time home-buyers.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Sri and Amar were a pleasure to work with! They never left any questions unanswered and always responded promptly and their collaboration skills are excellent. Sri offered great advice, answered every question and helped me make informed decisions. We had great conversations too! I know they are so well informed about each and every area and we can find that from the very first minute you talk to them. They execute the process so perfectly and always seem to know the right strategy. They personally were involved in all areas like escrow, loan and closing. When I had some doubts regarding the offer, my husband would always say, “If Amar has got into negotiation, he will win it for sure.” That’s exactly what happened.  Amar negotiated the best deal by all possible means and bought us a beautiful home surrounded with fruit trees!. We most definitely will suggest Amar & Sri to anyone we know who is selling or wanting to purchase a home because they both are experts in the field of Real Estate. We were lucky to have you as our Realtors!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Amar is one of the most patient and customer oriented realtor we have come across, with his association we ended up buying an excellent property at a best deal. I recommend Amar to anyone for their realestate needs.

Our Experience – Amar was knowledgeable on both the real estate industry and the neighborhoods of our interest. We visited several homes every weekend for months, but with our specific needs and tight budget, it wasn’t easy finding the right property. There were a few homes matching our needs but he pointed out hidden problems that we were unaware – most realtors would have pressured us to buy at any sign of interest. Amar was incredibly quick on the turnaround time, and was always proactive. His professionalism and relentless determination in making the deal happen keeping his clients best interests at every stage of the process (and resolving unforeseen hurdles) was greatly appreciable.

Amar, your passion, thoughts and actions demonstrates inclination in taking care of your clients needs first. We are proud to have you part of the team and cannot thank enough for your help. We commend you for all your efforts in buying our new home and look forward for your continued association for future needs and best wishes for expanding your portfolio of services. Thank you Amar.</review>< Pics>

We met Amar in his Palo Alto office for the initial consultation on a Friday afternoon and got enrolled to the website portal. In our initial consultation Amar read our mind and knew what exactly we were looking for our next home.

Sri and Amar are incredibly amazing at what they do. For each property that we were interested in, Sri gave us insights that we would not have found anywhere else. She walked us through all the pros and cons for each property we were sincerely thinking of bidding. All they wanted for us to make a best informed decision. They both made themselves available 24x7.

Amar was personally involved in all the areas right from the beginning till we were finally settled in our new home. He stayed on the top of everything and made sure the buying process was as smooth as possible. It sounds unbelievable but within 2 weeks we bid on the house and with his sharp strategy we got the house too. His coordination with the banker was incredible which made sure that we not only got our offer accepted but also the loan process was smooth.

Last but not the least we started our journey with Amar and Sri as our realtors but we ended up with life long friends. We wholeheartedly recommended Amar and Sri Amar.<//Review>

Sri, Amar and their team have a well established process in place that they execute to perfection in the home buying process, I'm very impressed with their adaptability to the COVID-19 situation. When sellers where pulling back properties from markets, buyers were backing off deals, and lenders were tightening their mortgage lending standards, Sri/Amar got me the home I wanted below market value in a breeze. We highly recommend them for buying your first home or an investment property.<//Text>

Amar explained us about all the steps and initiated our pre-approval. No one believed we put our first offer within a month (Oct 10th) of our home search. Amar and his assistant Maria efficiently assisted us on getting through this offer though there were multiple competing offers. He with his excellent contacts expedite all the process which involved loan process, inspection, appraisal, and insurance. We closed escrow and got our dream home key exactly within 2 months (Nov 10th) of meeting Amar. Its all still like a dream….

Overall Amar has a very talented team and he makes you feel comfortable in the entire home buying process.< /review><Date>1583366289008<//Date><UserId.>114278451118893276365<//UserId.>< pictures>

I never felt Amar is an outside person trying to offer you something. My first time home buying experience cannot be more pleasure than this…..

Amar trained me in all the tools required to take informed decisions right from day 1. He took time to drop by my office during lunch on very 1st week I talked to him. He spent time to understand what I am looking for and gave valuable suggestions on how to begin the hunt.Every listing that I send, Amar has responded what are the pros, cons and suggested actions.

In just 2 months we found the right property, Amar flung into action. Seller had multiple competitive offers on the table. With Amar’s sure-fire Negotiation skills bid 3% less than other offers and still managed to win the deal with his creativity. Winning such a deal is incredible and astonishing in multiple offers situation. Above all, Amar got the deal way below what I authorised him to make an offer price. This itself saved me 30K.Most of the Realtors simply don’t care saving buyers such a huge money when buyer himself authorizes to make offer price. Amar handles the whole transaction as his own transaction and always keeping client interest in heart.

Amar efforts doesn’t stop there…. I was out of town while closing the deal. Amar by himself took care of home inspection, termite inspection, mortgage consultant, escrow, repairing, etc at the best possible deal. In this process, Amar actions not only saved me over 5K but also time and efforts. After closing the deal, Amar followed up to make sure everything was looking good and offered help to resolve any problems with the property.

Amar’s constant and proactive efforts and guidance throughout the process is amazing experience and joyful journey.

In short, Amar is a reflection of you who guides to take informed decisions. It was a pleasure experience Amar. I would recommend Amar to anyone who is looking for a dream Home.<//review>

Amar, Thanks for your professionalism. Here is summary of our buying experience.

* Amar is very thorough in all aspects of home buying – making offer, to involving lender, insurance agents, provides contact for utility services and even for us reference to Pujaris for Housewarming Pujan.

* Amar’s lenders work very professionally and extremely collaboratively to make the close of escrow so quick beating market norms. This gives upper edge to buyer’s offer.

* Amar prepared offer for our home on very late Sunday night after we came back from visiting an open house.

* Amar has written unique offer terms with right strategy to WIN our offer at very attractive price before other offer IN.

* Amar adopted negotiation technique that suites our buying situation. His acumen in adapting negotiation skills are commendable.</Text>

It was a pleasure working with Amar and Sri for our first home purchase. They made the entire home buying experience a smooth and memorable one for us. In our first meeting, Amar stressed on team work which includes us, the buyers as well. At the end, it was the complete team work that won us the home. Amar's team is a "one stop" shop for home buying. Everyone in the team (Amar/Sri - realtors, Narayan - admin, Nicole and team - home loan and Millie - Escrow) played their role to perfection and their professionalism is of the highest quality.

Each member is highly experienced, collaborative, resourceful, and always alert. Whenever a challenging situation presented itself, they knew the corrective course of action and quickly implemented it. They all went above and beyond call of duty to take us to the finish line on-time.

We highly recommend Amar/Sri and their team to anyone who like us are serious about winning competitive bids and close the sale on-time. Amar's excellent negotiation skill and Sri's straight to-the-point advises deserve a special mention. Sri was in constant touch throughout the home search process. Sri educated us on what the target list price should be, which localities we should aim for and made sure we were putting our time and effort on property where our chances of winning was realistic. Sri and Amar reached out to us at key junctures, patiently explained the pros and cons, and readily shared their point of view: all of which greatly helped us with the decision making.

Amar won us a very competitive bid without multiple counter offers and successfully negotiated to have the seller pay a major portion of the closing cost - a perfect deal for us. Few days later the bank appraisal came in and the home was valued above the sale price - a true testament to Amar's extraordinary negotiation skills. Post the offer acceptance, the team worked very hard to close the sale on time.

Personally, we felt it was a huge advantage to work with a close-knit team as they collaborated among themselves to get majority of the work done. This allowed us to give all our time and attention to our son who at the time of purchase was barely a month old. A big thanks to Amar, Sri and team for all their help and care. We will be Amar/Sri's client for lifetime!

<date>1575258458603<//date><rate>5</rate><Text>We closed on our home in bay area and I have to say that it would have been impossible without Amar and Sri. We literally put an offer on a house in just two weeks and then closed within a month. People take years to find and buy a house in bay area.

In our case Amar was able to put an offer on the house even before it came on market and that helped us skip the bidding war. He was also able to get the price down by 15K which is unheard of in bay area. All credit goes to his negation skills and offer strategy.

Both Amar and Sri understood our needs and budget in just one meeting. They are on top of everything and we never ever had to send any kind of follow-up emails. He also helped us with mortgage lenders and pre-approval process.

So if anyone want to buy a house in bay area then Amar is the best realtor you can ever get!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

It was a great pleasure working with Amar, Sri and his team on our first home and we would like to THANK YOU for all the work you have done. From giving you a call for the first time to getting keys in hand, 60 days flat which includes a 3 week christmas break. We picked a home that we liked after looking at different properties and you got us the keys to the house in less than 30 days (including pre-approval, negotiation ~ 31 competing offers, appraisal, closing etc.).

We knew we picked the right set of folks to work with on our first call itself. Your follow ups with the seller, their realtor, banks and escrow in a 31 offer scenario is outstanding. You made that happen with flawless execution with first offer. It is very likely other 31 offers were from more experienced buyers, we being in the market for the first time *without an all cash offer* and winning the contract on a $5K less than our upper bound with seller contributing towards closing costs, speaks volumes about the hard work you and your team put in.

Your network of working with banks and other related parties makes the home buying experience much more smoother than one could imagine in the hot bay area real estate market.

We look forward to working with you on many more real estate needs to come.</text>

It is with great pleasure and honor that we write this recommendation for Amar Amaranth, THE Realtor and share our unique buying experience with AMAR extraordinary standard of “Excellency in Service” that truly defines “E=MC2” Service. AMAR is ONE STOP Shop for your real estate needs. Period! I’m NOT a first time home buyer and have had worked with many agents in the past. Trust me and you look no further. Bottom line summary for you- AMAR got us a deal on the first day we MET in Person, AMAR saved us over 75K with fire sure negotiation , MANAGED to close the deal BEFORE open House in a most competitive and highly desired Mission San Jose District. Have you worked with Realtor who stayed up until 1AM for a client needs and work around the clock next day to close the deal?. Sounds unbelievable right? BUT it’s true…

Let me start with this first- AMAR is truly a “GODSEND” for us. We were emotionally drained out in the first 2 weeks of trying to buy a home in challenging market with aggressive buyers. I reached out Amar in desperate personal situation having only 3 weeks left to buy a home. On My first phone call with Amar, I started with do you accept this challenge? 3 weeks only, Mission San Jose neighbourhood only, Fixed budget range. Can you work with me?. He said Yes and I told him “you don’t have to explain who you are and I have done my homework researching on you – saying that I’ve literally spent over 2 hours reading all your client feedbacks. If there is ANYONE that can do this job, it has to be YOU. And He PROVED it that I was right in mere 5 days. From that first phone call and three days later I personally met Amar first time in person and the next following day he managed to close a deal AND saved US over 75K which is something not everyone can do.

It is hard to find someone like AMAR who genuinely care about his client needs and protect your interest in every way possible. Amar recommendations were very best in the field, from insurance to inspection, warranty that saved lot of money in the process. His advice and guidance through this process was invaluable. His attention to detail, knowledge of the market and “Relax… We will guide you THE ENTIRE PROCESS “approach was something unique that we have experienced with.

Amar is simply THE BEST. A true commitment for lifetime is what you get from Amar. No Realtor will work and provide an excellent service and continue to support your needs in the way that Amar did because sometimes even via email, phone call just the communication itself, we felt that he was working just for us AND thinking that he is doing this for over such a long time speaks volumes about Amar’s commitment towards his clients. We can’t imagine going through this process with anyone but him. I have no doubt in my mind, if you buy or sell property in Bay Area and not using AMAR then you are missing something for sure.<//Text>

They had purchased their house recently with Amar’s help and they had only good things to say about him. It made my decision simple.

As a first home buyer we had lots of questions and apprehensions but Amar & Sri helped us at every step guiding and helping us in choosing right homes and bidding for it. They are very professional but at the same time make it a personal experience.

Every house that we bid Amar made very serious and diligent effort and it made differentiation when finally we landed at our dream home. Kudos to them in seeing the deal go through. They made our home buying experience much simpler and smooth. But it didn’t ended just there, they helped us in our loan process and successfully closing the escrow without any hiccups. I will highly recommend their services to my friends.

Thanks Amar & Sri.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

My Home Buying Experience Since I made contact with Amar Amarnath

Hi Amar, It is with gratitude that I say Thank You for your efforts that enabled me to buy a home in this highly competitive market.
I want to go over from the days of my first contact with Amar that happened only three months ago.  Since then our interaction has been nothing but pleasant during our combined efforts in our home buying experience. We toured homes together and in that process Amar explained to us several bits of pros and cons in each property educating us and giving his honest opinion about the homes and whether it is worth to proceed or not. Frankly, we learnt several bits of information of what to look for in a potential home.

Amar is always available to clarify and explain various aspects of home buying process and available to tour homes at the first available opportunity. He utilizes his enormous experience in real estate business and transfers that knowledge to help his clients and goes out of way in doing so. I can attest to that with my own experience where Amar helped me get a great deal while negotiating in a very competitive environment with multiple and handsome offers from the competitors.

Amar's reputation in the real estate business, methodical approach and analysis, highest standards of ethics, professional way of handling the negotiations, and ability to convince the seller's agents are phenomenal. More importantly, the personal touch he brings to negotiating table makes him what I call Amazing Amar. No wonder he is one of the most popular and trustworthy Realtors around. He also brings in positive surprises along the way.

Amar has wonderful team that makes home buying process quite comfortable and importantly also enjoyable, closes the deal in record short times. He takes a very proactive care to ensure the process is moving smoothly by going above and beyond. Amar involves in loan pre-approval process, coordination and engagement with bank and escrow process, appraisal, loan process, and closing process by staying on top of the entire home buying process.

Amar is good at heart and puts his efforts as it his own home buying process and that is a very important aspect as far I am concerned where in you build trust. He saved us lot of money in the process. In a nutshell, we have benefitted a great deal by approaching Amar Amarnath for our home purchase. I strongly advise potential home buyers to utilize his professional experience to benefit.
Thanks,

Amar and Sri helped us in getting our first home and made Home buying a memorable experience. Amar asked us to meet him in the office to find out what our preferences are and from then he has guided us, and very responsive in every step of the process from Pricing to Loan to Escrow to Closing. Amar also saved money in home price and closing cost due to Amar's tremendous knowledge and negotiation.

Our first time Home buying would have been nerve- wracking and confusing, if Sri would not have helped us answer all the very small doubts that we had. Sri was always there for us and guided us throughout the whole process and gave us examples how we can make proper decisions on important items.  She always responded to our phone calls and answered them with lots of patience and made us understand everything and made our first time home buying experience a really pleasant one.

Amar's knowledge is tremendous in negotiating, with the agent and in writing attractive offer that helped us in getting the house we wanted. we were looking to buy our first home for many years now. We started to loose hope in getting our home. Then we met Amar through one of our friends reference.  Amar gave us tremendous confidence, and in less than a month we made an offer and bought our first home.

Amar guided us through every step of the way and made our dream come true. I strongly recommend Amar and Sri as they have tremendous knowledge and good  negotiating skills. God Bless Amar and Sri.</review>

"In my opinion, Amar is the best real estate agent in Bay Area. When we started looking to buy a home, Amar was very instrumental in deciding the area. He has good knowledge of the good residential areas around Bay Area. He is very friendly, understands our needs carefully. We are very particular about the direction and vasthu of the home. Amar was always available to see every house and provide his honest opinion about each home. Because of his vast experience and deep interest in real estate, Amar is able to provide the best feedback; he is very patient and gives great attention to buyer's needs. Amar treats it as buying his own home. Amar documents each home we considered; which greatly helped us in making final decision.

When we finally decided to make an offer, Amar presented the offer in a very unique and most effective way (Amar's patented style of presenting an offer) to win the offer in multiple offer situation (over 20 offers). He not only won the offer even though it was not the highest offer, also saved us very good amount of money in the whole process.

Most importantly, there was more competing offer to seller from listing agent's office. With Amar's unique approach and proven strategy, we were able to win our offer in virtually impossible situation. I have personally experienced Amar's spellbinding offer presentation and creativity with sellers and listing agent. In today's' market, Amar makes a BIG difference in winning deals with clients interest in heart.

Amar followed up with the seller agent very proactively in a professional way. He has best network of Loan Agents and Escrow Agents, hence we were able to close the escrow in record time. The loan Agent Yogesh has always been available, very responsive and got me the best possible rate due to Amar's relationship and closed the loan in a very short period of time. Amar also has the best network of home improvement contractors, plumbers, pet control contractors. Amar communicates each Key Mile Stones (KMS) in home buying process steps in detail. The entire home buying process from acceptance of the offer to closing of escrow is very pleasant and smooth and exceeded all my expectations.

Thank you very much Amar. I highly recommend Amar as a Real Estate agent for right guidance (extremely critical), peace of mind transaction (very important), and value proposition (tangible results)."< /review>

Awesome place!  Better than what I was expecting.  The owner, the staff, everyone very kind. The view is great, the 20 feet away river is an amazing place to have fun. We came in summer time, the weather was perfect to swim in the river and go hiking to the sequoia park.  We will be back next summer!<//Text>

<text>Super relaxing and eclectic. Mars the owner was very available and helpful. Very peaceful and tranquil. Just the way that the river bends & pauses only a few steps from our doorstep was AWESOME! We are considering renting the entire property for our whole family next year!</text>< Pics>

Stayed here many times over the years, very tranquil with the river flowing right by and quiet atmosphere. Owner and staff are very accommodating and courteous. Every room is different(stayed in all of them), the master suite is the best with room for at least 6-8 ppl. Has private balcony as well. They light 2 fire pits at night so you can enjoy a glass of wine with the other guests under the stars. This place is worth coming to, you will find yourself wanting to spend more time here after your first visit as it's very relaxing.< /text>

My family stayed here to be close to the Seqouias. This BnB was more than amazing. The house is adorable and right next to the river and in the center of Three Rivers. Our room was clean, spacious and had the most amazing view of the river. The staff were very friendly and prompt to assist us with anything. Some might even call this BnB magical... we will definitely come back and highly recommend this to anyone.<//Review>

Quirky decorations but the owner Mars does an excellent job with her guests. She strives to make your stay a good one. Things I liked about the property: 1. the river views although the water was running so fast, we couldnt go near it with my small children. 2. the beds are so comfortable with quality bedding. 3. Excellent service. Mars met us from the second we arrived and was attentive to our needs. Her staff, too, is great. Disappointments: The ice maker in our unit did not work and we had to keep going back to the office to get ice. They gave us a small container of ice each time which was not sufficient. 2. the price is outrageous. Although our booking on Hotels.com stated the breakfast was free, Mars offered it to us for $18/pp. No thanks. The cost of the room was not worth it. The hotel is on a busy street and doesnt fit a 5 star cost.<//text>

The Rio Sierra Riverhouse was in a great location for us to make our home base while spending three days in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.  Mars was a wonderful hostess, our room (the Panorama Room) was clean, well appointed, and had a great view.  It was so nice to sit outside in the late afternoon and evening and enjoy the river and relax with a book.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun place to stay while at the National Parks.</Review>

<review>By FAR the best in the area.  Very beautiful setting regardless what room u reserve.  Easy walking to the river and small to medium waterfalls.  Easy swimming in the river pools. I really have nothing bad to say about this place besides its exclusivity hence the mention of planning months in advance.  Rooms may seem pricey but it is totally worth every penny.  The staff are an absolute joy to have around.  Gardens are magnificent.  BBQ is on site and very nice so bring a cooler with some steaks or stuff for burgers if that's your jib.  Propane fire pit up top and fire pit down by the shore, make sure to ask about wood for the fire pit as they have hours for when it is available.  I plan on visiting again just to stay on the property, but the park is a very short drive either way. Mars is the owner and she will do whatever she can to accommodate your stay there.< /review></record>

I love everything about Rio Sierra Riverhouse... the setting by the river is gorgeous, the rooms are comfortable, clean, and uniquely decorated, the staff, especially Mars, are friendly and welcoming. I honestly cant say anything negative about Rio. Ive stayed in the Master Suite and the River Studio and I love both. If you like relaxing by the river and being just a short drive from Sequoia, this place is for you.</review>

We arrived and were greeted by the sight of a beautiful sand beach on a small rapid in the river. After a brief tour of the amazing master suite, we waded into the river for a refreshing swim. The river was even better the next day after a long hike at the national park. The breakfasts were plentiful and delicious, just could not have asked for a better place to stay!<//Text>

Wonderful place. Beautiful nature. Lovely people. Nice details like flowers in the room. Grilling marshmallows in the evening. Awesome breakfast! Best place to stay when you visit the Sequoia nationalpark even with kits. Could stay even a few days longer just to relax and hang loose :-)<//review>

Lovely stay here with my family. We were brought a basket with marshmellos, graham crackers, and chocolate to make s'mores by the fire. We were able to sit right next to the river and be in touch with nature. Highly recommend, we wish we could have stayed longer.<//text>

We stayed for two nights in the panoramic suite. View from the suite is magical. Ability to walk by the beach of wayward river is awesome too. It was pretty cold and rainy, so we were not able to swim in pool-like area, but I could imagine how cool it is during hot day.<//text>

A great place to stay if you are looking for a base to explore Sequoia National Park from. We really enjoyed sitting by the river watching the sun go down, and also the killer breakfast the next morning. Friendly, helpful and kind staff.<//text>

Five stars because our room and amenities exceeded my expectations. First of all, my husband and I stayed two nights here with our 14 month old son to celebrate our second anniversary and they provided a *clean* pack and play/crib for our boy! That meant so much to me... we were going to let him sleep with us but thankfully we were able to enjoy our nights together here. The location is about 1.5 hours from the entrance to Sequoia National Park but I would have rather stayed at Rio Sierra instead of gone to see the big trees.

The river was SO much fun. To anyone with kids, I was surprised to see that some previous guests layed out rocks near the shore to create two 'kiddie pools' which allowed our son to have fun and let us feel more secure about having him in the river.

A few things I adored were all of the private and relaxing spots to sit down in the shade or even in a hammock. The towels provided were large and soft, easy to find and smelled like honey, oh my they smelled SO GOOD. Mars seemed to have a green thumb (like myself) so I REALLY loved what she did/does with the place. She has utilized every inch of that place to grow gorgeous foliage/flowers.

Our room was gorgeous and inviting. I felt very comfortable and the shower/tub had a giant moon light above it and a large potted plant sitting on the tile beneath the light. I will include a photo. What a romantic bathroom with more than a few night light/lamps and plenty of counter space. We had breakfast once made by Deborah($15) and once made by Mars($10) and although Mars was smaller, and they were both healthy and wholesome. You can make special requests ahead of time by texting Mars.

In closing I would like to mention how kind and well spoken Mars is. I was coming around a corner to get something from our room when I was greeted by Mars big smile, hand on her hip, asking, "are you my guest?". She was kind enough to unexpectedly serve us ice cold hibiscus tea while we were relaxing under the shade after a swim. She answered all of my questions and even told us the detailed story of how she acquired Rio Sierra, who built it, etc. The house was already charming but that just added to it.

In closing, I have a few cons to note for future guests. If you or anyone you are staying with is a light sleeper, be aware of the squeaky old wood flooring. I grew up in a house with squeaky wood flooring so although it was nostalgic, it made walking to the bathroom with a sleeping baby in the room quite a mission. Also, our bed was comfortable (especially the pillows) but squeaky as well. If you are afraid of lizards, they are everywhere. It really gives the place more character. I love reptiles but I also know some scaredy cats.

My last comment is on a charge we had after we left the river house. We were confused about a 'room cleaning fee' of $25 so I gave Mars a call simply to ask if we had made a mess or something of the sort. I had never seen a separate charge for a room cleaning. Mars explained why they do it that way and quickly offered to credit us back the $25. How sweet of her! We just cannot wait to go back to Rio Sierra!<//text>

< Review>
This is a very nice and comfortable B&B.  All rooms are self contained with the team own amenities.  Breakfast is served on the verandah overlooking the river and is a delight of eggs, cereal with fruit and yoghurt OJ, and coffee.  Home made jams with bagles, crossaints, and muffins.

The owner and staff were very friendly and gave good recommendations for local places to eat in the small town of Three Rivers just down the road.

Would highly recommend this place.<//Review>

Wir waren alle begeistert. Der Panorama Room ist ideal für eine Familie mit bis zu drei Kindern. Am morgen früh raus um den Massen im Sequoia zu entgehen und Bären zu sehen. Am Nachmittag am Fluss chillen, baden und grillen. Wir würden sofort wieder hier buchen.< /Text>

I explained all my rental property tax and mortgage tax issues, He listened carefully all tax related issues and explained me nicely. I  understand how to deduct mortgage interest along with other expenses associated with my rental properties can also be deducted ."

<review>Motin is not only qualified, but also diligent and hard working as well. He spends time with you, answers all your questions, and works hard to get you the maximum refund. Between March and May he literally sleeps in his office. Where else are you going to find a CPA willing to spend this many hours working on your taxes??<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Mr.Motin Bhuiyan is a highly qualified CPA, and tax advisor. Excellent , fast, responsive, research based, reasonably priced......all things you want in a tax service. I highly recommend Mr. Bhuiyan for a multitude of tax issues. He is intelligent, personable, professional, and provides prompt and accurate responses to your questions. Mr. Bhuiyan is generous with his time, and often provides guidance or advice as a value added part of his practice. He was very detail oriented and knowledgeable. I feel very confident with his work  and professionalism.<//Review></record>

<username>G L<//username><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Contrary to some of the "1 Star" reviewer's experiences, I have had nothing but cordial and transparent relations with this company. I went in recently to have some complicated taxes filed and was helped by Mr. Bhuiyan personally. Not only did he review everything I had provided in a systematic approach, he also drew upon some resources and deductions I did not know I qualified for. The work was completed, presented, and filed in front of me during the one visit. You know exactly what you paid for and are filing. Mr. Bhuiyan also provided tips and hints on how to help your upcoming tax reductions for the year ahead so you can plan accordingly; priceless.

He was very well mannered and of course the outward appearance of his office seemed what some have quoted as "messy", but again it is tax season and he was extremely focused amongst everything. In terms of pricing, we asked up front and he had a set price without ambiguity or "sketchiness". His pricing is extremely competitive for the area.

His office also provided stickers for the kids as well as snacks to munch on during the duration of the appointment. Parking is convenient and appointments are flexible.< /Review>< pics>

I was also able to schedule an appointment at 7 p.m (i think you can schedule up to 9 pm!) so did not have to take time off from work. Most other firms usually have a 9 to 5 rule so this was really convenient.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Brother Motin from Bhuiyan & Associates helped me with my first tax return!  I have to say, I was very pleased with his services.  Not only is he a friendly and patient tax preparer, he is very knowledgeable in his field of work.  I'm definitely coming back next year, and would recommend him to anyone looking for a tax preparer or someone to help them with large or small scale investments.</Review>< userid>

It has been an excellent experience first time doing taxes with Bhuiyan & Associates. I worked with HR Block for many years but eventually i realized i am overpaying them and taxes are not done properly instead of being eligible for refund i was paying out of my pocket.

Mr. Motin Bhuiyan is one of the most friendly and honest CPA I have worked so far. I used to file my taxes through other CPAs who would false promise me, I tried H&R Block, nothing comes even close to what Mr. Bhuiyan provides. They give you complete peace of mind and do your taxes according to rules and regulations. Since I have discovered them, whenever the tax season is around I just give them a call. And within hours they file my taxes. This year I gave them my W-2 at midnight and saw their email around 4 in the morning that my work is ready! Highly impressive. I highly recommend them!<//Text>

< Review>
My experience with Bhuiyan CPA was good.  created an LLC in 2014 with 2 foreign partners, which made the tax returns more complex than usual. I was expecting, because of the unusual complexity of an otherwise simple return, that I would have to pay a steep fee. but no, the fee was small and I also received a lot of great advice and guidance that might have come with an extra charge at another company.
All in all, having Bhuiyan CPA do my tax returns turned out to be great value for money.
Mohammed provided me with a good tax savings strategies, Keep up the good work. Thanks<//Review>

I have been using the services of Mr. Motin for my tax return and IRS related matters for quite some years. I have always found him a very knowledgeable person in his field. He is friendly and is available as per your time schedule. I am over all very happy with his services and would highly recommend him.</text>

I have been working with Bhuiyan & Associates, for last eight years.  They are very professional, and very knowledge. They are friendly and accommodating. I got the most refund from IRS for last eight years. I will highly recommend them for the tax preparation services.

I have been visiting bhuiyan Associate for several years to file my taxes. So far the experience has been excellent. A very friendly guy, who gives equal importance to all customers regardless of their status and income levels.
Motin Bhuiyan, the owner and chief tax accountant, is the most friendly, honest and hard-working tax accountant you will ever work with.
I would highly recommend them if you are looking for Tax or Book Keeping services.<//Review>

I have been working with Bhuiyan and Associates for last ten years for my taxes. They know the intricacies of tax laws, very affordable, prompt and efficient. Win Win on both sides. I highly recommend local businesses and residence to  support our local Tax Firm.

Motin from bhuiyan & associates has helped me in fixing my IRS quires. He not only corrected the tax returns filled incorrectly by my old CPA but also save me lot of money that IRS had posted on me. He is very helpful and give you full attention no matter how busy he is.<//review>

My advice to you guys don’t ever trust a cpa especially this guy always ask him what he is doing and how much he will charge you before doing anypaper work with him or you are going to be screwed,thats what happened to me cause am new here in the US and came to study and i was told that he is an honest guy and after i gave him the money and went back home and checked what he have done for me and i knew that he charged me alot for nothing and i could have done it for free cause its just a form you download online and its free and its not even for the taxs and he charged me 200$,
And cause my brother in law told me about him and he deals with him and i had no clue how much he will charge and didn’t ask cause of his reputation but he took advantage of me cause am new to this kind of stuff and trusted him.
And the funny thing after what happened i texted him and told him what you did is wrong and you took advantage of me and charged me alot for almost nothing so his reply was that he have to pay his bills and if i came in different time of the year he would have charged me ALOT CHEAPER and thats specifically what he said.
Bottom line don’t trust him unless you do your research and ask how much he will charge you for anything</text>

<Review>BhuyanCPA has been helping me with my tax documents since 2007. I am travelling everywhere in the United States but I always knock Mr. Matin, when it’s come to tax filing. He is very organized and patient with my questions. Mr. Matin gives solid advice and take the stress out of tax season. I trust my taxes in his capable hands. Mr. Matin is extremely helpful. I highly recommend him.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have been using the services of Bhuiyan & Associates, CPA, 2118 Walsh Ave, Santa Clara, CA 95050 for the last many years. Motin at Bhuiyan & Associates is the owner and a very reliable person. I have three W2s in my family, a couple of stock trades and kids's education expenses. All I did was to leave my documents with him for only three days and thats all. He called us for signing the final documents and my tax papers were out with the IRS on-line, the same day, right there. I am expecting the refund soon. I would highly recommend Motin at Bhuiyan & Associates as a reliable person. Just an FYI that he has staff with Viet, Bangla and Spanish language expertise also that can help in personnel or business tax. He charges very nominal amount of fees that are much much lower than other CPAs. That is another reason for maximum benefit by filing taxes with him.</Review>

<Review>We had a small business that was closed in 2009.  To add salt to injury, the IRS sent us a bill for $500k and a 3 year audit notice.  My savvy business friend said "Get Motin."

Motin certainly masters the audit game.  He knows how to organize and present data convincingly. Motin helped to conclude the audit in 4 months.  It was certainly not a cake walk, Motin delivered the best possible result, "no adjustment." The IRS sent us the refund owed plus interest.

Motin give us our piece of mind back.  Worth every penny!</Review>< date>

This is a total joke of a barbershop. A guy called rick 'cut' my hair; in over 30 years of getting haircuts, he is the first one to not shave the back of my head. Chopped off a bunch of hair off the top of my head without any method - it doesn't look great. Didn't have the heart to tell him myself after the haircut given everything they've been through with COVID - but recommend going somewhere else for sure.<//review>

I don’t know why a guy asked me at the beginning “How would you like your haircut?” if he did his way after all. I don’t know why he cut whole my bangs off without any asking. And I just hate myself been without bangs. Agh overall I didn’t like it. I would put less stars.<//Text>

Ray did not disappoint. It’s a friendly place that’s family owned in a town where that’s rare nowadays. 30 bucks for a haircut. They take cash only but have an ATM on site.< /Review>

< review>
An old school barbershop - Took a friend for a hair cut and he was amazed on how they vacuum your head to get rid of the little hairs. Perfect spot for business men, athletes , or children. You can be stylish or  frumpishly technical and they will try to get you the haircut to seek.</review>

Best haircut ever! A little pricey but totally worth for quality. They even have a little vacuum at the end to suck up all the loose hairs on your head. The best part, No talking just watching sports.</Review>

<review>My mom cut my hair better.

For $26 I got an old man to come at me with 1 scissor, for five minutes, and unevenly cut my hair.  Literally the worst hair cut I've ever received. One should try to cut their own hair first before going here</review>< Rate>

I think this is the best male barbershop in downtown Palo Alto/Stanford area. There is usually no wait time, and haircuts are always well done and consistent, regardless of who cuts.<//Review>

Came in to buy a gift, rep showed items that were over my budget, asked for something within my budget, her tone immediately changed, then she brought out something even more expensive. Very interesting tactic to get people who they think won’t buy expensive items out of the door so that they can make a more expensive sale.</text>< Pictures>

<review>If I could give zero stars, I would! My husband made the mistake of purchasing clip on earrings for me for Christmas and when we finally went today to exchange them, they wouldn’t let us do anything with them. The woman was extremely rude and unhelpful and the manager wouldn’t even come speak to us. I’m floored by their customer service...especially with covid restrictions and everything. We have a new baby and running off to Tiffany’s during covid wasn’t our first priority. We have been shopping at Tiffany & Co. for at least 20 years (purchasing one or two items every year) and I can honestly say that we will never shop here again. What a disappointment for a company we were so loyal to.< /review></record>

Let me say 1st truly a 5 star perhaps a 6 star experience! The courtesy and knowledge of the staff is unbelievably great. the beauty of the interior and exterior design of the store is simply beyond compare. The merchandise of course is at the very very highest level of quality. And of course the prices match, but it's true you get what you pay for. I can't think of any way to deduct even a 10th of a point; truly a 6 star experience.<//review>

< Review>
Unbelievable customer service from Sarah, the store manager. I seriously don't recall meeting someone so nice and that gave that high of a level of customer service.
She didn't care how much we spent, she just wanted us to have the best experience ever! And because of her, we did.
I can see why she's been promoted by Tiffany & Co. to Store Manager.
Thanks Sarah for making one of my daughters 15th birthday present unforgettable!

I want to compliment the Customer Service department at this location for upholding the tradition of impeccable treatment and honoring their complimentary cleaning policy- especially when I decided to drop off about 5 or 6 items at once. Upon receipt of my gorgeous items (one piece Id had since 2002) I left feeling grateful and excited to share my review , highlighting the dedication to customer satisfaction.< /text>

<Text>Horrific service. I have been to Tiffany stores across the country. This one has by far the worst service of any store. In fact Dollar Tree has better service. I am unimpressed by designer items in general but when I am forced to spend money for something designer I expect top quality customer service that frankly I am paying for.  based on two visits here is what my wife and I experienced:

1. The first time we were there it was the start of December and was very hot in store. We walked to the counter as we do in their other stores only to find out after ten minutes that we had to “take a number.” First I shouldn’t have to take a number and second many employees were either standing around and doing nothing or not informing customers. After a 20 min wait we were finally helped the lady was curt even after we spent several hundred dollars.

2. An hour ago we walked in and there was very little foot traffic same thing take a number. Then I went to get my wife’s necklace cleaned and we waited for thirty minutes just to drop it off! Just to find out they would take a week to clean it!! A necklace?! Really? Then I asked about return shipping and they stated I would be charged $20!?!
This time we were in to shop for our first baby.

We will not be coming back to this store it was horrible. I don’t know if they are trying to give the appearance of being exclusive or what but the message they are sending is incredibly poor and if I am going to spend significant amounts of money the service better be excellent. Go to Tiffany in Pasadena instead!<//Text>< Pictures>

I went today (12/27/19) with my fiancé to look -and maybe buy- a bracelet. We found the bracelet I like in the glass case and an blond employee came by helping a group who looked like they were going to purchase. We waited there, standing next to the group for 5-8 min. The employee didn't even make eye contact or told us the classic "I will be with you guys in a min". I told my fiancé to walk around with me, and after walking around for 5 min he asked a lady with a Tiffany color scarf in her neck and she told us about A LINE WE HAD TO DO TO TALK TO A SALESPERSON. Meanwhile there were a bunch of securities and other employees with who knows what position walking around and people watching. I will NEVER come back to this store.</Review>

< Review>
I love Tiffany’s. I always get Christmas gifts here and have been gifted presents. I have found that their online customer service is fantastic. However the reasoning for my three stars is for when I have to visit the actual location in South Coast Plaza. There is this one lady that I always unfortunately get stuck with, C Johnson (short black hair) i believe her name is. And it truly makes me not want to come to this location. Like I actually don’t look forward to going into the store if I end up getting assisted by her. She’s always in such a poor mood and has snarky comments and is very short tempered.
I don’t know if it has to do with my age and she makes judgements but I’ve had about 4 encounters with her none of them were worth coming back to the store. Trust me i wouldn’t have if i didn’t need to.

I did recently just pick up 2 items i had cleaned and Taf i think his name is and Haleema were wonderful. So that is worth noting.<//Review>

I had an infinity bracelet for about six months and it broke and luckily I found it on the floor. So I took it to get what I thought would be may be a new one, but no they wanted me to send it out to get fixed and charge me $50. Then I couldn’t make it down to pick up when it was fixed and they were going to charge me another 20 to send it to me. What a joke, worst customer service ever<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Wonderful service and selection. For the best customer service, I recommend trying to stop in during the week, when it is a little less crowded. Almost everything Tiffany carries nationwide is in stock/in the store, which is refreshing (and somewhat unusual as we all know how quickly Tiffany sells out of popular pieces). Highly recommend this location for all things Tiffany.<//Review>< Pics>

The South Coast Plaza is the nearest location and service (like the establishment) is indicative of history, class and artistry in the tradition of Tiffany---in business for over 100 years.

Tiffany Blue is the signature color and is a registered trademark. When ladies/men receive blue bags/boxes with white ribbons its difficult not to smile. Tiffany blue is memorable.  Notice the creative windows displaying sparkling offerings and COVID19 protections observed in place.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>110792431341706254499</user_id><Rate>5< /Rate><response>{'time': 1611004628067, 'text': 'Hi India M.

< Review>
Despite the store being Tiffany & Co, the customer service is HORRIBLE! If I could rate my experience a zero, I would! I walked in yesterday to buy a necklace for myself and the girl that helped me looked like she hated her job. I was not greeted, not a hello, good afternoon, or how may I help you. I was able to walk around the store 3 times before I had someone say "is there anything you need help with." The girl that helped me certainly did not make the interaction a personal experience. I asked to see three different necklaces and every time I asked to see one the girl made a face. I've made all my purchases online and I regret not making this one online as well. I honestly expected better customer service, especially being Tiffany. I am tempted to say this experience has completely turned me off. If it was because the purchase was a birthday gift to myself, I would be tempted to return my purchase and taking my business elsewhere. I will definitely not be buying from Tiffany & Co.< /Review>

< review>
I am from the metro NYC area, and shopped at the 5th Avenue flagship store many, many times. Since moving to Orange County, I have been extremely pleased with the Costa Mesa store, which has a large selection and courteous sales associates. I also want to commend Mark Pacheco in customer service. I worked with Mark several times to get some issues resolved with one of my purchases, and he was extremely helpful, patient, and pleasant.</review>

Very helpful and courteous staff.
I didn't know that they weld the charms on the bracelets for free as we've had one charm just hanging on a clasp and another was missing a clasp, they assisted us in processing the bracelet that we've had for 3years now.</Text>

<review>They never ever answer the phone! No matter what extension you hit or what time you call. Very discouraging, especially if you don't live in the area and want to check availability before you drive down. Only reason I put two stars instead of one, is because after my 5th call back to the store someone finally answered. I'd probably have better luck getting through to a radio station :-/< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>WORST customer service EVER. I was assigned by a sales associate named Merrell she had 0% interests in customer service .. I can tell that she doesn't want to be there by assisting me. When I asked her I want to look at the heart bracelet that was about $150 and asked if I want to get it 2 beads out she was like " you pay here and then go to the customer service area to get it done" and she wanted to assist other customers and I wasn't even done and had few questions left..she just have zero understanding of a customer standpoint what i would be interested in   and I'm like..IS THIS RETURN LINE @ WALMART?? WHY DO I HAVE TO WALK THERE AND GET IN LINE AGAIN. AND EXPLAIN THE WHOLE THING AGAIN--  .Expecting a high end customer services from high end brand? i don t think i am asking too much..  I just couldn't believe the level of customer service is just handled poorly. I know the bracelet might not be the most expensive item that they sell but the way they treated customer was just not acceptable.  Tiffany & Co., if you are reading this please train them again.. this is by far the worst service I received by Tiffany & Co.,  very disappointed< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>For the amount of money you spend here you would think customer service would be a whole lot better. I bought a black enamel necklace and black enamel charm, and after a couple of months of wearing it, the black enamel began chipping off of the chain. When i bought the necklace i asked about that occurring and the sales lady said it was a new product and they weren’t sure if that will or will not happen so just bring it back if that does happen. I called the store and spoke to a very unhelpful and rude guy named tak. He was acting as if he had no knowledge of them evening selling the kind of necklace i bought. He carried on an i explained what happened and he tells me well the only way for that to happen is if it was impacted. I said well idk what kind of impact that could be, hanging on my neck. Then he said bring it in and bring your proof of purchase. I said i dont have that any longer but you should be able to look me up. He said the only way to look me up is by my name and many people were in the system by my last name, peacock but nothing came up under Morgan. He went on and refuse to try other ways to look me up and said there was nothing he could do. So i knew that was BS, and asked to speak to the manager. Totally different story, she was a little more helpful but she was rude as well and fast talking me. Like rushing me off the phone. But she did find me in their system by my card info. And said to come in and IF WHAT I TOLD HER WAS THE CASE THEY WILL REFUND OR EXCHANGE IT. She said it as if i was most likely lying about the enamel coming off or there may be evidence of more happening to the necklace than what I said. Of course when i get there they see their product is bad quality and refunded me. These people are so stuck up and rude ill never patronize this company again. And the craziest part is most of the jewelry was tarnished and looked bad under the light! POOR STAFF, POOR CUSTOMER, POOR QUALITY!</review>< pictures>

Natalie was quite helpful in letting me try on different ring sizes. I would recommend this place and give 5 stars but there is just too many customers and usually there is a line here.<//Review>

<Review>Customer service is way more than I expected. Excellent! I would like to commend Ms. Corrina Perkovich of Southcoast Plaza, Costa Mesa, Ca for assisting me to find the right engagement ring last Wednesday, October 29, 2014. Job well done! She is an asset to Tiffany & Co.</Review><GmapID>0x80dcdf2f80af9bfb:0x37f062b6199aeaa5< /GmapID>< username>

Yogurt is great but it would be nice if they could post their hours! We thought they went out of business for 2 weeks because they were never open, don’t post their hours, and don’t have a working phone number.😡 need to learn how to manage a business.</Review>

I liked that they  had dairy free options. Somewhat of a long wait, but for the price, I thought it was worth it, compared to Creamsicle, which I went to recently and paid double the price.</text>

Craving Filipino food, found this closest to me on a lazy Sunday, 1 table inside and 3 outside tables available for dine in, small menu and fairly priced, the calamansi mojito is pretty good, would come back when I’m in the area again.</text>

Very lovely dishes they have here, I just deleted some of the photos but they have some serious Filipino delights here, right at the heart of sepulveda. Budget friendly too. Rice portion will never be enough for a hungry stomach. These are the desserts they have.<//Review>

Garlic fried rice? Yum!! Filipino breakfast sweet sausage Longaniza? Scrumptious!! Filipino breakfast beef steak Tapa? Oooh they have that too.  Sisig (if you dont know what that is, come and find out, tell them I sent you) with poached eggs AND garlic fried rice.  Breakfast made it in heaven.  Annnnd the piece we resistance is some gooooood coffee. Uhhm yum.  Come and try for yourself, your tastebuds will love you for it.</review>

Delicious sisig tacos (as long as they remember to drain some of the fat/oil... still good but too much grease). Great staff! Servings are a little small... especially on the sides, but the food is still really tasty!<//Review>

<Review>I frequent this excellent restaurant often since I love the  special atmosphere that is part of this restaurant. The personel is highly attentive and well trained. The service is remarkablywonderfully efficient. Not to mention, the food you eat is excellent. I ate there often and I was always happy. The price is fair. I recommend this place to my friends and family.<//Review>< Time>

This place is small! Or rather you could call it cozy or intimate. The decor was nice, love the wood pieces and artificial leaves. Pretty clean place, square dishware, friendly servers. I can't comment much on the food since it was a preselected mother's day 4 course meal including dessert. The meal wasn't oily all, everything had a light taste but was filling. All in all nice little Filipino eatery.< /Review>

My office ordered our meals through GrubHub.
3 separate orders of lumpia were all combined into one container, had to separate them on napkins to divide them.  That really was my only complaint.  Food was okay.

Pictures on webpage and reviews looked great, guessing this place would be better in person.  Servings looked small.

Would not order through GrubHub again.  Really think this would be better if you dine in.</text>

Really good food! Service is amazing! Staff is friendly.
Adobo tastes a little sweet, but nonetheless still adobo, and still good.
Sisig is my only problem. I honestly wouldn't particularly call their sisig, "sisig" But that's pretty much it.
EVERYTHING was good!< /Review>

<Review>The chicken adobo was not like I have ever had it. It was much too sweet. More like a candied Hawaiian chicken, but not grilled. I didn't like that they piled chicken on rice topped with egg. I like rice topped with egg separate from meat. Christmas music was so incredibly loud. Bench and table too tight for me. Too bad, I was looking forward to finally finding close by place with good filipino food.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The food here, is out of this world delicious!  I can't wait to come again and try  more dishes. The flan texture was creamy with a crunchy layer of caramelized goodness. The people here are great and happy to serve.

I never write reviews but for this place I will. The food was very tasty and it was more humble to know that our server was the owner.  The serving staff was very attentive and the food was delicious. Definitely worth the drive from central LA. The pork belly and beef silog is the way to go.<//Text>

Parking is limited as it shares with the shopping center. Surprised they didn't have Pancit. You can only get if it the special for the day. Get the appetizer versus the a la cart sisig it's a bigger portion and not much more expensive. Overall was delicious and would definitely recommend!< /review>

<text>Wanted to try this place after driving past for months. Generally was disappointed. Got the Sisig entree to go. The portion size was ridiculously small. More like a snack than a meal.
Predominate flavors were garlic and mayo. Pork had little flavor or seasoning other than "fried" and there was very little of it.There was a thick yellow oil coating the entire bottom of the container. Some of the chichorron pieces were hard as a rock and I almost broke my tooth on them. Not impressed.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd4a835a08b61f:0xc1002948f0c51f90</Gmap_id></record>

This place was amazing TodayI originally went over to that strip mall for a Korean place but saw that it had low reviews and was over priced so I decided to go to Silog. We got there a little early but the owner was kind enough to let us in and order. The food is excellent the customer service is even better. I will definitely be returning<//review>

Delicious food. Authentic Filipino flavor.  Great fast customer service. Courtesy and friendly. Clean and beautiful atmosphere.  Highly recommend the Longisolog, Abobo Pork Ribs Silog and the Turon ala mode to complete your meal.</text>

<Text>I miss going to school here! Cabrillo is a great school, it has a great location, wonderful professors and supportive staff/faculty. I made so many friends and connections here as well as discovered my major here. I am now graduating with great grades at CSUS and plan on getting an MA in Child Development, Special Needs Education next Spring 2019. There was a time I took a break from school, I came to Cabrillo and made the best decision for my career.<//Text><name>C S</name>< userid>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>This place has the worst admissions, administration, and employee base that my wife or I have ever dealt with.  I have 2 boys registering simultaneously and both are told different things, both are treated completely differently, and both are admitted with completely different status even though their situations are exactly the same.  The moral of the story is - if you don't like the answer you get from one person, stand in a different line because the person right next to them will treat you completely differently.  It's a total mess.< /Text><UserId.>105542109364760661195</UserId.>< name>

Cabrillo is a great community college with many AA/AS degrees as well as certificate programs.  The Culinary Arts programs is awesome with a the Pino Alto Restaurant as a place for the students to cook with their professional teachers and be rated by the public.  The catering class even gives the students experiences catering weddings by being a part of the front and back of the house.

The Cabrillo Summer Youth Programs are great for kids. My daughter enjoyed the computer class in which they put together computers/ or fixed and then added software to make the computer or laptop usable.

The Cabrillo Youth Chorus om the college campus and taught by the college choir director is excellent. The chorus gets invites to Carnegie Hall and other places because of their excellent reputation and quality singing by the young people.  It is a great program to learn about music reading, solfege,  rounds and sing a variety of music - classics, musicals, foreign language songs, etc.<//text>

They have put up FALSE PARKING CITATIONS  on multiple cars with VALID TAGS AND PERMITS. I tried to appeal but of course the photo I took of my dashboard with the parking pass and citation on the day of the ticket WASN'T ENOUGH INFORMATION.<//Review>

I taught English and Journalism at Cabrillo for over 35 years, retiring in 1995, and it was, and possibly still is, a place where serious or not so serious students might find the excitement and stimulation of higher education.  It is an important asset to the community and widely recognized throughout the state.</review>

the school itself is great but good luck trying to get any help at all from the Administration office, they don't like to take any kind of initiative and you have to jump through a thousand hoops just to register properly for classes. Other than that i've has a great experience here.<//Text>

Cabrillo is a great establishment. Beautiful campus with exceptional views, many great professors who care deeply for their subject. Parking can be a problem, but usually is remedied when people begin to drop out after the first month or two.</Text>

<Review>Cabrillo college is one of the premier community colleges in the state, if not the country. The facilities are mostly new and renovated, and beautiful to say the least. If you have classrooms in the upper part of campus you have a beautiful panoramic view of the ocean, but this is not what the review should be based on.

In my experience at cabrillo college, the teachers are wonderful. Many of them are off duty ucsc or San Jose State professors getting work on the side.
This college has many top notch programs including fire tech and nursing. Mr schwinge the fire tech professor was my favorite of all. Great program!<//Review><Rating>5</Rating>< Response>

<Review>The science department at Cabrillo is staffed with moth most gifted and caring doctors and masters of their field. Wading through the waitlists is well worth it and unproblematic beyond the rudimentary introductory courses.
I'm in my second and last year of courses, and the amount I've learned about the wonders of the natural world is staggering.  I've tested the effect of volatile gasses in the environment, extracted and sublimated caffeine from tea, and synthesized aspirin.  My teachers are my mentors and my friends.</Review>< date>

This is the only ramen spot I like going to in the valley.  The ramen is really good and the portions are pretty big. The appetizers are pretty tasty and the curry is also really delicious.</Review>

First time here, had to wait a good while for my food, but the wait is absolutely worth it. Food was great and I had only wish they'd have indoor dining but I respect their choice not to.< /review>

An amazing gem toughing it out in the heart of the city.

The interior, with it's chairs stacked and tables lining the walls as if barricading an imminent attack, shows artifacts of authentic japanese ambiance that deserves to be enjoyed.

Unfortunate that we are still confronted with our collective challenge, 'Kushu Ramen' embodies that quiet strength needed to survive. Like an old western, a shootout in the saloon, I hope to see this movie end with our heroes having the last laugh.

I'll look forward for what the future brings to this charming area. As a community, we need to help each other to get us better than where we were. I say thank you, for all you do and will do.</Review>

Love this place!! There is always a huge wait, maybe an hour - on the weekends. But it's so worth it - the food is amazing, and the price is...uh prefect for happy hour! And happy hour is at the exact popular time, not some obscure weekday thing to attract more customers during a slow time to fill up their cash registers. They really do care, and give you great deals. That's why there's always a line. I'll give it 4 stars only because the raw fish isn't always fresh. But all the cooked stuff id 100% all of the time. I go here almost every month. I MISS THE HOUSE SALAD!! BRING IT BACK!!!< /Review>

<text>Cozy and lowkey. Some of the staff and even cooks are actually Japanese so it makes for a more authentic feel. Very cheap and good portions so don’t go expecting a gourmet dish, however it’s still really good. I come here at least once a week to eat and get tipsy off the sake. It’s a must go for foodies.<//text>< Resp>

Mediocre at best.

Tried the ramen, sushi and Gyoza.
The ramen noodles felt the same if not worse than microwaveable ramen.
Sushi was prepared with overrippened avocado.
Gyoza was cold and soggy even though we asked for it fried.

I recommend only going here if you literally have no other option.<//text>

I meet with friends this place quite a bit! This is my favorite place to have a bite.  I visit this spot many times. The meals are fantastic, the staff members are polite and the payment is good. I enjoy meeting in this place for a decent lunch.< /Review>

Not really a Ramen fan and it was my first experience having it in a restaurant. I must admit, this is Ramen on a whole other level. Very flavorful broth, tender meat and filling.< /Text>

Amazing (and very delicious) food for such a great price! I ordered their Takoyaki (squid balls with batter, topped with thin bonito flakes), a plate of sashimi (good for 2-3 people, with salmon and tuna), okonomiyaki (cabbage with batter), and their kimchi! I was so surprised at the quality of the food, especially at their sashimi plate. It was such a great experience. Definitely my go-to place now for Japanese food.< /review>

I've been here quite a few times but have only gotten the chicken karaage. Love this dish and it's worth coming back to this restaurant just for it. During the dinner rush hour this place can get packed so be prepared to wait. During off hours though there is plenty of seating. A big plus is this restaurant stays open late. The service itself is hit or miss. I've gone when they are on top of everything and other times I've gone I had to wait 20mins after I had already finished my meal to get a server to notice me just so I can pay my bill.<//Review>

Happy hour is the best, pitcher of beer, sushi, and appetizers you can't go wrong. Sometimes the wait will suck but its happy hour so you deal. 😊<//Review>

THIS RAMEN PLACE IS FIRE. I don't eat pork so I had to opt for the chicken broth. I was worried it wouldn't be good but it was surprisingly amazing. The spice and flavor of the broth is one of the best I have tried.<//Text>

When it’s open for dine in it’s usually understaffed and the wait for a table it’s crazy long. Order by phone it’s the worse experience ever! You’re gonna have a hard time for sure! But the food, the price and the portions are good.< /text>

The place hasn't changed much, the menu hasn't changed much either, just the food flavor has changed. Perhaps it's a different chef or different way of making ramen. I usually order the Ramen and fried Calamari along with either Sapporo or Asahi depending on where it was brew. The food presentation looks fantastic, the taste has definitely changed. Even the calamari has a rough rubberized texture and makes it unappetizing. Their draft beer is flat and doesn't help when trying to overcome the rubber texture calamari and taste.

<review>Great authentic Japanese food. The best ramen I've had in the valley by far. I was also surprised to find a traditional Japanese dish that I loved when I was living in Japan. Most Japanese restaurants don't have this traditional plate so it was nice eat it...brought back some good memories. Enjoy this place and their food</review><Date>1566184081713<//Date>< user_name>

Local hole in the wall family owned Japanese restaurant.  If you are looking for affordable ramen,  this is your spot.  Their happy hour run till 9pm. Big bowl of ramen 🍜 + rice bowl = $9. Can't beat that!!</review>

< Review>
Kyushu Ramen in Van Nuys was the first restaurant we went to after a 2 week trip in Japan…we were in the mood to extend our trip locally and this place is right around the corner from where we live.

We’re all vegetarians and were happy that they had options for us, though in practice it’s fairly limited what is available. We ordered 3 vegan ramens, one with spinach noodles (for my gluten free wife) and 2 with regular noodles. The menu didn’t quite match what was actually brought to us (it was missing the yam cake displayed on the menu. They told us after they brought it that they were out of that item. Lesson 1 or 2 for restaurant people: Let people know about changes before you put them down in front of your diners…we like to be served what we actually order.

Besides that, the ramen had lots of flavor. It was a creamy style miso broth, though it had limited extra ingredients.

We were happy generally with the flavor but would have liked more of the additional ingredients in the bowl.

We might try it again but there are plenty of ramen places in L.A. so it probably won’t be our first choice after this experience.<//Review>

The service here is great! They seat you as soon as they can, even during the dinner rush. The food is amazing and they have so many choices so you never get bored with the variety. And they have this plum wine that is SO GOOD! Everytime I go I forget to ask what brand it is because I haven't been able to find anything like it nearby! Overall, great restaurant!< /text>

The place is relatively full at all times and kinda understaffed. There were only two servers and they truly were giving it their all. They both had a very nice and kind attitude despite of the fact that the overwhelming amount of work might have been too much for just two of them.

The place itself is clean and tidy. It has that typical japanese vibe and the decor and ambiance are reminiscing of any mom and pop japanese restaurant/shop.

The food is delicious and highly recommended. I had the Pork Cutlet bowl and so did my friend and we finished it in record time.

Highly recommended place to come if you don't mind the wait time (no chairs, host/hostess or lounge area, you just have to stand at the entrance and wait till one of the servers notices you, which might take several minutes) and you like excellent japanese food.< /Review>

This is not the first time I've had a negative experience with this restaurant, there have been several in fact.

30 minutes trying to get through on the phone to place an order, the line was just constantly busy.  Finally I get through, and I'm not even able to say a word when they tell me they're putting me on hold.  Not asking me if it's alright, just telling me.  So I go on hold....and I wait......and I wait....and I wait....and I KEEP WAITING.  Finally 45 minutes have gone by, still on hold, I said forget it their ramen is not worth waiting over an hour just to place an order.

I've eaten here before, it's alright, but the level of service has always been questionable at best, ludicrous or non-existent at worst .  There are other ramen place I would recommend trying for those of you like me who are tired of this nonsense of little to no customer service.  Like I said in the beginning, this is not an isolated incident, this is pretty common place.  I've been tempted to write reviews in the past about this place, but tonight just finally pushed my button for the last time.  I will not be coming back, I'll find another place.

<review>AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Read this post.

I've been coming here for 6 or 7 years now but after this Valentine's day I'll never be coming here again. My wife and I ordered our own ramen, hers arrived and mine never did. They never bothered to bring it by the time my wife waited and finished her meal. Tables usually feel dirty or sticky. If you're lucky you get a seat at the front  or a booth, if your unlucky you get seated on the left side where tables are so close together you can feel the people next to you cough and breathe on you. Better hope they aren't sick as well because the server will touch their dishes and then come right after with your food. The spoons used for ramen used to be nice but now always come smelling like dish soap or wet.

After paying for my wife's meal they just removed my ramen from the bill and acted like nothing happened. Went to ask for the manager and was asked by the staff if I wanted to order mine to go. No attempt to accommodate us after their mistake.

Manager never came. This place is horrible now. Enjoy the wait of 30+ minutes outside in the cold if you go during a busy time.</review></record></dataset><record>

I've been coming to this spot for the past 8 years. It's kind of a tradition to go here on Fridays. I have never been disappointed with the flavor or the service. There is a long wait every so often, but it's always worth the wait. The food is super delicious and the sushi is always fresh. They have a wide selection of foods. And they are always changing it up and bringing out new receipts. Some of the staff even know our orders. If I could request anything, it would be to bring back the green tea latte. My wife absolutely loved to go here for that warm drink.</text>

Husband and I came here for Valentine's day. Terrible experience.

They never brought my husband's food for the whole time we were there 30+ minutes. Gave us a bill for my meal and a "sorry bout that." Left us alone after, took the money and expected us to just leave. Asked for the manager but they only offered to have us pay for a to go meal.

Manager never came. Family next to us was coughing everywhere and the waiters handled our food with their dishes after they cough all over. Dirty spoons.<//review>

This is a favorite place for many.  Reviews are great and people especially love their ramen! I’d have to honestly say that I don’t enjoy it.  I’ve tried the Miso and won ton ramen and although the broth is flavorful... I don’t particularly like the noodles or the Chashu.  I’m very picky!  I like the variety they offer.  I have had the donburi which is great! Next on my list to try are the rolls.  Their prices are affordable which is a plus.  It’s one of the better options in the area.  It can get crowded, and it’s a small restaurant.  Also, not all menu items are available for lunch.  Better if you come during dinner time!</text>

<Review>Was a regular for years. Moved away for a couple of years and recently returned. Service has deteriorated dramatically. Bad attitude across the board from staff, poor service, poor attention to cleanliness of the restaurant, a total lack of respect for paying customers, and you will sit and wait largely ignored. Love this place for years. but it seems the ownership has changed, so unfortunately, I will not be coming back.< /Review>< rating>

This place offers real Japanese food. They imported lots of wild fish from Japan and cook it in Japanese way. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients it self. The price is reasonable as well. I love this place. I will come back soon and recommend it to all of my friends.</review>

<review>Great food, great service, if i could give this place a 10 star rating i would! Our waitress was really nice and the ramen i got was perfect, not a lot of oil floating in it like some ramen places and good portions. My boyfriend got the beef teriyaki and he said it was awesome too! Definetly going back!</review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Hmm where do I start.. well nice Japanese restraunt with alot to choose from but really came for the ramen soups. The spicy ramen soup wasn't spicy at all but it was ok. The traditional miso ramen soup was good but just didn't like the overall flavor bit eatable. I also ordered the jalapeño bombs and Harumaki and they were deilious. Fyi there actually 2 restraunts in 1. Overall not bad.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Tried it because it's right up the street. There are some low rated reviews on yelp which I don't agree with. Maybe they had a tough day or just to finicky. Anyways, I thought it was very good. Very generous portions and the squid legs were downtown.< /review>< pictures>

Not too many places stay open late. This one here is the perfect spot ..with Ramen and Sushi on the menu hmmm. When you are looking for quality food and not your run of the mill type of place. Come here to explore your taste buds. Be prepared for a wait or hang out at the Sushi Bar.< /Review>

A decent spot to grab some Japanese comfort food. Parking in the plaza is decent. Service is ok depending on what time you come and the food is a decent price for their no frills dishes.</text>

< Review>
I'm giving this place a 3 out of pure optimism. The restaurant is small, clean, and pleasant. The staff was friendly, attentive, and the service was prompt. That said, I cannot say good things about the ramen. I got the Chashu ramen because chashu, when done correctly, is a real treat. But the chashu I was served was WOEFULLY DRY. And I mean TOUGH. The shoyu broth was little more than boullion from a Maruchan packet. I cant speak to the rest of the menu, but the ramen was a hard pass. Pity. The search for great ramen in the valley continues.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Used to be a regular customer there, but recently their service has gone downhill like a snowball. Today when I walked in, was immediately greeted by a "please wait here to be seated" sign with an added sticker says "OK?". Sounds like someone is inpatient here but fine....So I waited with one other gentlemen before me. We stood there for 5 minutes and the waiters passing by just looked at us and never said a word, not even simple things like "be right with you in a sec". There were empty tables right in front of us but nope, all the waiters just attend other matters and gave you this expression that they don't give a fk. Definitely the worst service I've ever seen in a restaurant.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I like that this place his tucked away, hidden in the corner of a liquor store parking lot. The last place you would look for an establishment that offer friendly staff, a fun atmosphere, and fun sushi. I hope just because I rate it highly, it doesn't get too popular. Keep it up!<//text>

This Place is good when looking for something near(the valley). They have an ample variety of plates to choose from. I am forced to give them 1 star(would've given it 5) but there's a waitress whom aside from barely speaking comprehensible english, has such a negative attitude... She will ask you what you'd like and as soon as you begin, she quickly gives you a look and tells you to give her a second because she's overwhelmed with her order device. So you feel like you did something wrong(her remarks and annoyed facial expressions). The thing of it all is that, you are barely able to understand her and she's the one with the short temper. She only smiles and laughs with her co-workers but not with the clientele(the irony)... Nonetheless  the food is good and price is reasonable. Will still recommend because it's tasty food.

************UPDATE JAN. 2019**********
This place STILL continues to have poor service... From the moment you arrive, and stand there waiting for one of the staff to acknowledge you, to the end of your visit. They will pass you and look the other way, so they won't have to make eye contact. When you kindly ask for napkins, fork, soy sauce, etc, they are over the top rude. They roll their eyes. Look at you/talk to you as if you are wasting their time. It's baffling... I was laughing yesterday because I find it  incredible how people in this type of environment, have the courage to comport themselves in this manner. There are only 2 waiters that are really nice and just plain friendly. They totally have what it takes to tend to customers. The only issue is that they aren't always there. So, because their food is good and local, we have been tolerating their rudeness.
They SERIOUSLY need to check their attitude.<//text>

<text>The food was just ok. The curry and Ramen was watered down. The salmon roe was basic. I'm guessing I just didn't order the right things becuase I asked a friend about this place after eating and they said I should have gotten the udon. 2 stars for the food and an extra star for the prices. It's an alright place if you're tight on money but I wouldn't expect an authentic flavor from here. My friend agreed with me on the flavor and she's Japanese so I'm pretty convinced it wasn't just me.<//text><Rating>3< /Rating>< Pics>

Do not come here on the weekend, they leave their 4 to 5 star items off the menu, if the service was the same as their week day, easily a 4 or 5 star review, a 1 star for weekends  for an average of 2 to 3 cumulative score.</Text>

Food wasn't as good as I remember it to be. The rice around the sushi rolls were hard and would fall apart. Ordered dessert and I had to wait a very long time for it to not even be as good as I thought it would plus the raseberrys used to garnish it were old soggy. I remember it being better couple months ago, I'm dissappointed.< /review>

Ramen was good, the vegetables sushi cut roll was delicious, but the BSC was not so good.  They used that awful butter sauce that normally doesn't go with that roll.< /Review>

I've been coming here for the past 20 yrs... creamy shrimp, spicy tuna sushi... are all yummy.  Teriyaki beef... yummy too... place may be small, service so-so, parking sucks, but the food is good...</Review>

<Text>I had my last visit here in my life already, because I found a DEAD FLY in my ramen soup at the end of my lunch. Got the lunch free as a result, but no apology from anyone - they wanted to settle quietly. Then I choose to speak up here.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
please be aware that they have an online menu with prices (only the restaurant can post these prices). When I called to place the order, their prices were different; and much more expensive. I explained I am looking at their pricing on online. They got defensive, argued with me and I just moved on somewhere else. Please get your prices straight and stop deceiving. Rather than honoring, you were arguing.<//Review>

<review>I love this place. I've been coming here since it opened and they had the menu as pictures of ducks and pigs on the walls. Get the fried rice, it's the best I've ever had. I love that you can now get sushi as well. For a few years the service was terrible here, but it has improved significantly and I'm back to being a regular here.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>The food is absolutely amazing and totally worth it however the experience with the staff I have had has been subpar at best. Both times I have been here we're for take out and the staff is really quiet spoken and not really so much ready to help. Maybe if you are sitting you might have a better experience than I have. Either way the food and their hours is what saves it overall and keeps this at a solid 4 stars</Review><Time>1538279885231< /Time><Response>None< /Response>< user_name>

Recommend: the house ramen and katsu curry. The sushi here is always good. Particularly love the SoCal roll.
I could wax poetic about the service or the atmosphere but just try out some of the menu items and enjoy. The food speaks for itself. And there is so much good food to choose from.</review>

This is one of my favorite Ramen shops.  I absolutely LOVE the rice bowls.  Tasty, filling, and not super expensive either.  If it's been a long day at work and you want a hot meal, stop in and say hello.  They'll serve you with old school palm pilots (for real), and give you some good grub.

I'll admit, the service could be a bit better, but this isn't a bad place to just hang out with friends. It's worth the slow service to eat here. As far as the price goes, it's much cheaper than your average Japanese restaurant in LA. The value you get here is much higher than what you would expect in the rest of Los Angeles.<//text>< pics>

The ramen was good for the price. But the service was bad. We order side dishes without onions, specifically requested no onions on anything in our order.

They brought out our ramen first, then we get to the end of our bowls without our side dishes coming out. At this point plenty of other patrons had gotten their sides and ramen.

I politely notify the waitress that our sides have not arrived. She goes to check up on them. Thankfully within a few minutes our first dish arrives... With onions all over it.

I let the server know that we had ordered it without, he takes it back. A few minutes later they bring the dish back without onions. I start moving the grilled meat around and there are onions that had slipped through the crevices.

So they basically took my food back and cleared the visible onions but still give me the dish that was covered in onions.

I asked the waitress to cancel the side dishes and just bring us the check.

I was very disappointed by this experienced... especially since this place is so highly rated.< /Text>

Definitely a most go if you haven't had a moment to go. Miso spicy Ramen was just delicious. It made me satisfied and I enjoyed it all. It had a great touch of spicyness and the flavors were just perfectly balanced. The place is really nice on Mondays around 10pm. Also if you plan on going I heard that on the weekends this place gets packed. So make sure to go from Monday thru Thursday. And what I loved about this place is that is closed at 1am. So time is not an issue.<//Review>

I'm giving a four star because the server Michelle was super nice, and helpful and all in all seemed like an awesome person. I ordered the spicy deluxe ramen. I am a little disappointed because it's not very spicy, the noodles were al dente, the meat was bland, and the egg was definitely overcooked. All in all good experience but I wouldn't come back for the ramen. Michelle's service made up for the ramen that is for sure< /review>

Busy, busy, busy. The service here is terrible, but the food is FANTASTIC. If you don't care about being served and you're all about the food, then this is the spot for you. If you're even a little bit arrogant, then don't bother. You'll be too annoyed to enjoy the food. That's my honest review.< /review>

<Review>Been going here for years, it seems they got a new owner.  Meat portion in the ramen (both chicken and pork) are small compared to before.  The sushi side of the restaurant has a lounge feel to it, low lights and loud music.  Thing that were not there before.  I saw a few families trying to have dinner with their children and loud music playing in the dinning room, looked and felt strange.  I guess it time for me to find a new ramen spot.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Only one vegan options all the other ramen you couldn't even substitute cause they make them in batches and serve them and already have beef broth. It's really easy to make ramen vegan they should have at least one other option for a vegetable broth bas soup. Plus the server was super rude I didn't get his name but he's tall really skinny young and Asian. Most of there menu you can't even buy till after 5 pm so annoying!< /Text>< gmapID>

Highly recommended. If you enjoy some good ramen at a good price especially for the hearty amount they give you, then you have found a more-than-just-good spot.

Waited for a table for over 30 min (could visibly see open tables/booths), then waited an over an hour to receive one roll of sushi and steamed gyoza..  waitress was very scattered, inattentive, and would leave as we were speaking with her or trying to order. Watched a group that sat down 5-10 min after us get their food before our table.< /review>< response>

Kyushu is that hole in the wall type of place you find when trying to find a restaurant that's open past midnight.

Servers are always friendly, variety is good, and it's pretty well priced. Wait times are sometimes an issue because lines do amass on weekends and Fridays, but dining wait times aren't bad at all.

Their ramen, takoyaki, katsu, and sushi are all great. The Hanabishi box and sushi boat are gimmicky orders but they are worth the price you pay for the amount of food and experience you get in my opinion.

I've never had any bad experiences there. Definitely recommend to anyone, especially late night diners.< /review>

<review>I went here tonight for the first time. Good hosts but the place is very small. You are basically shoulder to shoulder with the people to the next table. They have a sushi bar there as well that takes up a lot of room. The place is divided by a wall. One side, where the entrance is located, has table booths more suitable for privacy and chat with friends, up to 4 people. It has a wall in between which divides the sushi bar and these booth tables. The area with the sushi bar has two people tables so you are forced to sit in front of the person you are with. I went here with my girl friend and I enjoy sitting next to her rather then in front. In addition to the sitting arrangements, the food was decent. I ordered Spicy pork ramen which took my taste buds a minute to get use to. I was not able to figure out this flavor I kept on tasting with ever zip of the spicy broth. The noodles where very chewy and the texture of doe was really out there. Pork was soft but all together it created a flavor I was not to fond of. In conclusion, i do recommend this place if you want a quick bite of either sushi or ramen. They have a variety of liquor, which am sure would of made me enjoy the place a lot more if I drank a bottle to myself. Good luck and enjoy.< /review>< Pics>

<text>It’s been a while since I’ve eaten at Kyushu Ramen. Must be a new owner. This place was the place to get good Japanese food in the Valley. I was bit disappointed. The food is mediocre and the service is basically not there. The servers are unfriendly and seemed overwhelmed. I might still do takeout...,maybe very very maybe. Go at your own risk.< /text><rating>2< /rating></record>

They do not use slow cooked pork broth it seems. Might be chicken. It's missing the richness of 12hr+ pork bone broth. I would go back though. Cant beat the value of the sushi. The van nuys roll goes down so easy.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29746bae330d3:0x8191e11ecfc0a503</Gmap_id></record>

It’s been a while since I’ve eaten at Kyushu Ramen. Must be a new owner. This place was the place to get good Japanese food in the Valley. I was bit disappointed. The food is mediocre and the service is basically not there. The servers are unfriendly and seemed overwhelmed. I might still do takeout...,maybe very very maybe. Go at your own risk.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Kyushu is that hole in the wall type of place you find when trying to find a restaurant that's open past midnight.

Servers are always friendly, variety is good, and it's pretty well priced. Wait times are sometimes an issue because lines do amass on weekends and Fridays, but dining wait times aren't bad at all.

Their ramen, takoyaki, katsu, and sushi are all great. The Hanabishi box and sushi boat are gimmicky orders but they are worth the price you pay for the amount of food and experience you get in my opinion.

I've never had any bad experiences there. Definitely recommend to anyone, especially late night diners.</text></record>

<text>This place really has the best ramen for the best prices in the valley, it also serves beer which is a step up from on the places on Ventura blvd that don't have their liquor license. The service here is really bad almost 97% of the time. But the food makes it worth it. Spicy ramen, sushi, and a cold beer. Can't expect much more.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Seriously had an awful time here , I’ve been coming to this restaurant for over 10 years and am disappointed in the service I received from the moment I walked in. Me and my husband had to wait a long time before anyone asked us about our drinks and our order. The waitress “mookie” was very rude and seemed like she didn’t care to help us. We ordered 2 rainbow rolls and a Sapporo , 45 mins later we finally got our rolls and the soy sauce bottle on our table was empty ,we asked  the waiter that brought our rolls if he could get us some soy sauce , he never came back with anything my husband had to get up and ask the waiter and he just told him to “wait bro I’m working two sides, I’ll get it to you right now” so my husband asked for a refund since he didn’t eat anything and the service was terrible as well as the miso soup we got was watered down. The sushi was getting warm since they had the heater running too. The waitress had a horrible attitude throughout the whole thing never gave us any napkins and never checked on us by then my husband had enough he had to get up to ask for the check and  his refund for the roll he never ate, the waitress had called the sushi manager on the other side (Hanabishi Sushi) and basically lied about her bad service as he argued with my husband saying “my people don’t do that” “your wrong”! Super rude manager as he didn’t want to hear it. Really went out tonight to have a good time with my husband and eat some good food but will definitely not be coming back here as it was such a bad experience tonight. Hope they get it together since the food is good but overall customer service and a lot of other things are just bad.< /Text>

On the day we stopped at Kyushu Ramen... I had a major craving for ramen. Kyushu was a restaurant that is hidden in the San Fernando Valley area. It is a small place with no major catching signs. When we arrived there was a line which to me was a great sign. We waited around 15 minutes for a table of three which was surprisingly fast. When we entered the restaurant it felt very lively, but crowded. Kyushu has a great menu of sushi and ramen. Because of my craving for ramen I only choose ramen. It was the bomb! The broth was delicious and very memorable for me. I have saved Kyushu's location on my google map so when I am in town... i will surely visit it again.< /text>

Been around for sometime over 25 years for sure. And the owner of this place is originally from Japan and his father owned restaurant in Tokyo. Awesome food and the sushi bar (izakaya) is the same owner and you can go to either restaurant to enjoy all food! 1 of the people's choice entree is "chicken karaage" dinner. And its open late and last order is like at 11pm on daily basis. Great place!< /text>

<text>The people were very rude and the hostess was on her phone while we waited to be served. After an agonizing wait we were finally seated but but they never led us to a table so we sat ourselves. They then asked us to move to a different table and we weren't served for a while. A server finally came but he was going back and forth not giving us a chance to order. They were looking at with very strange looks. Bad service and no Dr. Pepper! One star by far.< /text><Date>1519277868884<//Date><resp>None</resp><user>108485232670771938143< /user>< GmapID>

<Review>I've been coming here for the past 3 years... and never have I experience racial favoritism in such a rude and straightforward way until today!!! 😨😱😳😵
As I am already aware, this place always gets packed! Which explains the sucky service at times. They have a sign-up sheet for seating outside... and I understand they try accommodating the best seating for each party. BUT WHYYY the heck was there a need to ask if someone was "Thai" in order to give you a seat is BEYOND me!!!
I was the next person on the list and got skipped over because the next person was "Thai" and spoke Tagalog! Really?!?!?
And NO... her party wasn't bigger or smaller than mine! We both would have fit in a 2-person table. SMH!
So with that being said... feel prepared to feel ignored or dismissed NOW if you're not "their people" - I suppose! 🤔<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The curry here is so perfect with consistency and flavor. I get it every time I come here with chickenkatsu. So. Good.<//Review>

<review>I ordered a spicy tuna rice bowl, it tasted like a mixture of old tuna and mayo. It literally looked like cat food. I asked to have something different and was told it was "fresh" and they would not replace it.

As far as the ramen goes, you'd be much better going to Urban Ramen or Silverlake Ramen... places that actually slow cook their pork broth (actually have pork broth for that matter).<//review><date>1437534437545</date><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

We had to flag one of the servers down after waiting for menus for 10 minutes. Then we waited 30 minutes for our orders to be taken while a man next to us was seated right away and had his order taken within 5 minutes. The servers just kept walking past us. Terrible service.<//Review>

<Text>HAIR IN FOOD - HORRIBLE SERVICE - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This restaurant has really taken a nose dive in their service and quality of food ... will never return here again.  Few months ago we ordered the Hanabishi box, when my honey took a bite of the tempura shrimp, he had to pull out a Looooong black hair from his throat that he almost swallowed ... we were totally disgusted but we managed to eat the rest of our dinner carefully...the waitress apologized and gave us a small discount.  Then tonight we decided to give it another try... this was a huge mistake.  We arrived on Sunday night at 8:30 p.m. and there was a sign by the door that says Please Wait to Be Seated... so we stood by the sign for more than 10 minutes and nobody greeted us.  We finally caught the attention of one waitress and she told us to go outside and put our names on the list.  We explained we have been waiting by the sign and nobody told us about a list.  She rudely tells us that's how it is, everybody knows this.  We asked her if it's possible to be seated at a booth, she says write "booth" next to our name when we write it down on the list. So ok, we waited some more, then finally we were seated to a table right next to the front door, the booth right next to us became available and we asked if it's possible to be seated there and she told us, if we want to move to another table we have to put our name on the list again and wait again for our turn.  Then 3 booths all opened up and she still would not let us move without starting the whole process all over again.  This was utterly ridiculous - she said sorry it's our policy.  We ordered the Hanabishi box again, she never brought us a spoon for our soup, then they completely left out the shrimp tempura.  So we waived the lady who brought our food to us and mentioned that there is supposed to be shrimp tempura with this dish, she said she will check the menu. She brings me the menu to let me know it doesn't come with it, but we pointed out that the photo clearly shows two shrimp tempura, so she said she will check with the manager.  Finally, another lady brought two measly shrimp tempura.  The salad was wilty and warm, the soup was cold, the tempura was cold... Also the table where we sat there was a glaring white light right in our eyes, we mentioned this to our waitress and she told us to move to the hard chairs on the other side of the table instead of the bench we were sitting on so we don't have to see the bright light. She said she will turn down the lights - but she never did.  Also when people were seated to the booth next to us, the whole bench was rocking and creaking, and the guy sitting next to me couldn't stop shaking his legs, so we were also bouncing on our bench.  This was one of the worst dining experience, so now we didn't have hair in our food but everything else was truly TERRIBLE!   GO SOMEWHERE ELSE if you want an enjoyable dining experience with better service and food.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Visited here while in the area. It had a high rating and appeared to be good. My coworker had pho and I had spicy ramen . I'm glad I had the spicy style. If packed a flavor punch. I felt like the combo ramen I got hit the mark in terms of flavor and and amount of meat. I felt like over all the soup and the noodles were excellent. The service was fast and attentive although not very much in the way of talking up the pho over ramen options. I'd be back if I werw in the area.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The ramen is spot on and beautifully served, as is the food which is great. The sushi is also very good. The atmosphere is indeed very cozy and nicely decorated and allows for a comfortable experience. The service is good too, the servers are very kind. The place becomes very busy at times, but the wait is always worth it. If you're looking for a good experience and excellent traditional Japanese food, Kyushu is one of the best places to go!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

< review>
I’ve been there plenty of times, the ramen is very good. It’s not NYC Totto Ramen good, which is why this isn’t a 5 star review, but that’s the bar for ramen for us. Broth is always flavorful, noodles are well-cooked (meaning, not mushy or over-cooked). I order extra pork because I like a heartier bowl. The appetizers we’ve had are mostly pork belly bao, and the popcorn shrimp. The service is always good and friendly. An excellent addition to the Stamford restaurant scene!< /review>

Last time I ate there I paid them with my Wells Fargo Visa Debit Card. A Young man took my card & I had to remind him to give it back, ever since then I had to replace it with a new one. I'm sure they Jacked me & doubled charged me. Very disrespectful, even though I tipped them $ 10 with a roll of quarters I had withdrawn from Wells Fargo Bank I also lost my Smartphone, & MPCS Account. Was Lost because of Unfriendly Customer Service. They never cared for me, because they know I'm USA Citizen, Native American Indian !  🇺🇸🦅 Those individuals are still working there, most probable still scheming & scaming. Bad Place to eat Good Japanese Cusine! I still have my receipt, my debit card I used & My MPCS Smartphone! 🏜️🏆🏅🥊< /Text>

Hands down, best ramen in town.  Top that with their scrumptious endamame and finish it off with their sashimi platter and you have the whole spectrum of delight, wander and awe at your fingertips, quite literally, the beginning of the end.  A warm meal alongside a cold serving of generous portions of Toro.  It's how the last meal might taste like: melt in your mouth, mouth-watering goodness over volcanic subtlies.</review>

We ordered Vege Ramen with no tomato because my Fiancé is extremely allergic. I emphasized this twice as well. She repeated to me. "Yeah I got it." I ordered the beef short ribs. The size of the meals to me got WAY smaller than they were before. Ramen came with tomato. Then the manager came out to argue over the fact that we didn't mention anything to the server. Our server lied to her manager telling her we mentioned nothing to her. Also. People who were seated 15 after us. Got thier food before we did. Lmao. Not going back here anytime soon. We waited 30 mins to get food that wasn't prepared correctly and argue over he said she said bs. Stay away.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

I been a regular at this place for a long time. It's usually busy and the food is great but the customers service is really lacking. Today was the last straw I usually go with my girl and two waitresses already know us  and are super nice since we are always here. Today I came by my self and I waited 40 plus min for just me, and when I go and check on the sign in sheet two couple walk by my and are escorted to a table like I wasn't waiting for 40 damn mins. And to add onto it I then wait 15 min more to be called, so when I do finally get called I wanna sit in a booth and I get dismissed and they wanna seat me in a place that I know gets a lot of traffic because of the bathroom. I also know this because I AM A REGULAR. I'm pretty sure the waitress that dismissed me is a racist, ever since I started coming here she always has had that additude with anyone that is no Asian trust me all my friends and family have notic. But whatever they lost a loyal customer today, never coming back again.

Update: 5/30/2018 pretty weird after I reviewed this place the waitress that was being rude was let go. Only reason I found out was because my brother would still go to this restaurant and he let me know that the owner spoke to her about all the complaints he was getting about her. I have gone back since then and it's way better now since some of the waitresses have been replaced.< /Text>

This restaurant has really taken a nose dive in their service and quality of food ... will never return here again.  Few months ago we ordered the Hanabishi box, when my honey took a bite of the tempura shrimp, he had to pull out a Looooong black hair from his throat that he almost swallowed ... we were totally disgusted but we managed to eat the rest of our dinner carefully...the waitress apologized and gave us a small discount.  Then tonight we decided to give it another try... this was a huge mistake.  We arrived on Sunday night at 8:30 p.m. and there was a sign by the door that says Please Wait to Be Seated... so we stood by the sign for more than 10 minutes and nobody greeted us.  We finally caught the attention of one waitress and she told us to go outside and put our names on the list.  We explained we have been waiting by the sign and nobody told us about a list.  She rudely tells us that's how it is, everybody knows this.  We asked her if it's possible to be seated at a booth, she says write "booth" next to our name when we write it down on the list. So ok, we waited some more, then finally we were seated to a table right next to the front door, the booth right next to us became available and we asked if it's possible to be seated there and she told us, if we want to move to another table we have to put our name on the list again and wait again for our turn.  Then 3 booths all opened up and she still would not let us move without starting the whole process all over again.  This was utterly ridiculous - she said sorry it's our policy.  We ordered the Hanabishi box again, she never brought us a spoon for our soup, then they completely left out the shrimp tempura.  So we waived the lady who brought our food to us and mentioned that there is supposed to be shrimp tempura with this dish, she said she will check the menu. She brings me the menu to let me know it doesn't come with it, but we pointed out that the photo clearly shows two shrimp tempura, so she said she will check with the manager.  Finally, another lady brought two measly shrimp tempura.  The salad was wilty and warm, the soup was cold, the tempura was cold... Also the table where we sat there was a glaring white light right in our eyes, we mentioned this to our waitress and she told us to move to the hard chairs on the other side of the table instead of the bench we were sitting on so we don't have to see the bright light. She said she will turn down the lights - but she never did.  Also when people were seated to the booth next to us, the whole bench was rocking and creaking, and the guy sitting next to me couldn't stop shaking his legs, so we were also bouncing on our bench.  This was one of the worst dining experience, so now we didn't have hair in our food but everything else was truly TERRIBLE!   GO SOMEWHERE ELSE if you want an enjoyable dining experience with better service and food.</Review>< gmap_id>

I eat here all the time and have seen the quality slowly drop over the years. I just ordered the BBQ ribs today and most of the ribs had little to no meat on it. This was the last straw :(< /Review>

<review>Still the best. Definitely get the Special - spicy miso ramen - there are pictures on the walls to help you remember.

I got the Kyushu ramen which has a tonkatsu soup base, it was pretty good (: my ramen came fairly quickly, but my friend who got a bento box didn't get it until I was halfway done.. And this is one of the few places that actually has okonomiyaki!<//Review>< pictures>

It gets packed lots of people visit closes late. Come during lunch hour. And happy hour you can save a few bucks i been coming here for years hasn't really change much, consistency is key and kyushu has it dead on. I always do birthdays here and graduations, also celebration. The server's are nice people i like there positive attitude, the atmosphere is great feels like im in japan. During lunch hour the sushi rolls are crazy good salmon roll, van nuys roll the bomb.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>OYAKO DON SAMA!  I LOVE YOU!  Seriously, the chicken and egg over rice bowl here is amazing. It's almost on par with the one at Daikokuya.  Except it's a tad smaller but still oh so delicious. The cutlet curry is also delicious and the gyoza are your typical pork or chicken affair.  The prices are extremely reasonable.

The wait staff are polite, courteous and very professional.

Definitely eat here!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

One half does ramen and some other stuff.  The other half does sushi and other different stuff.  There are two separate menus.  The ramen half is open more hours than the other half, so some times you can only order off the ramen-half menu.  The rest of the time, you can order off of either menu (or both), regardless of where you're sitting.  The ramen is decent.  The sushi is average.  Not really worth ordering unless you have a deep craving and can't make it anywhere better.  Decent to good cutlet curry.  Terriyaki is okay.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

< Review>
Waited a good 20 minutes because we based it off the reviews so why not try it out? Get there, they take forever. Food was horrible, ordered chicken curry ramen and some other ramen? Whatever it was tasted like cup of noddles or something. The teriyaki rice and shrimp balls were good but if you want ramen, don't come here. I payed for 2 full bowls of soup untouched.<//Review>

It was my first time eating ramen and I loved it. I had the miso ramen and it didn't take long to get to me. It came hot and freaking goood!!! (Trust me, I cook) my only disapointment was that there was only one pork slice. Also, they have a whole wall of sake if you're into that.< /Text>

Ramen gets here in about 15mins, and none of the sushi got to us until AFTER 45 MINUTES! yeah its busy alot of people who came after got their orders which was really irritating. To top it off, the ramen tastes like the pork top ramen I make at home >.> the older server lady though was nice and the only one apologizing and on top of whoever kept giving our order to other people.

Not the best experience, so I might not come back here again. I'll stick with crazy rock'n sushi next time.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>I would have given this place four stars except for the service, which was abysmally slow, despite not having that many customers. Also there were a bunch of things crossed off the menu, which was annoying. Just print out a new menu, then!

Otherwise, the ramen itself was delicious. We had the mapo ramen and the ja-jen ramen, as well as the karaage chicken combo. They were all pretty good.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

< Review>
The staff was very unfriendly, I was asking a few questions about sushi to go and they kept interrupting me to do things off on their own, have me follow them to keep asking a single question. Barely talked to me and even left me talking to myself once when I was still in the middle of asking them something about my order. The sushi was so pricey and such little quantity, they even stuff their regular sushi with Wasabi without telling you so when I took a bite my mouth was covered in it and could not eat second piece which made it a waste of 5 dollars for two small pieces of sushi. Will not go back again</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) A store that I have known for over 20 years.
For a few years now, I lost my charm and stopped going.
The other day I went after a long absence and I felt something was delicious.
I will go again.
