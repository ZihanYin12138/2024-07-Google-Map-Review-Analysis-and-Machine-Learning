<Date>1618964186297<//Date><review>Still a great gym for those that mean business in their workout. Friendly staff, nice environment and lots of room to move about. Not too congested like other gyms. There's only one setback. The short hours due to the Covid19 pandemic. I can't help but wonder if LA fitness is trying to recover lost revenue from the lockdowns by cutting down the hours.🤔🤔<//review><gmap_id>0x80dcd101e078c073:0x5f5e70663a507ed9<//gmap_id>< Response>

Know that when I write this I am a long time member of 20+ years and understand that LA fitness is “itching to open”, per their corporate and that they have to follow the protocols set forth by the governor.  However, what is disappointing is that many other gyms have moved their equipment outside to accommodate their members(who are also itching to get back to working out), and corporate has indicated that they have no plans to move any of their equipment outside at all but share our frustration.  Many of the members of this gym are very loyal and have made fitness a life style.
I also know that in order to do so it is a long process, however the mall that this gym is in has allowed restaurants to set up in the parking lot. I know that not all parking lot or owners would allow all la fitness gyms to do that, but I do not believe that none of their property owners would allow it, when golds, fanatics, and 24 hour fitness have found ways for some of their
Gyms to accommodate members by moving equipment outside.  Again I am
Very disappointed at their apparent lack of effort to meet their clients needs, and know that many members have joined some of these outside gyms to meet their needs and if you do ever open again, you will
A drastic drop in members.<//Text>

This place sucks, almost all of the treadmills are broken and shake, their carpets are torn apart. This place is ghetto in the middle of Anaheim hills. Does not live up to Anaheim hills expectations.</review>

<text>I have 4 memberships at this gym. My husband, myself and two daughters.Friday night 8pm. Nobody is there. Empty gym.  Practicing volleyball on the basketball court and the MANAGER Terrance comes in to play basketball during his work shift and basically tells my daughter to stay off his side of the court. Keep in mind the three of us at $90 per month (CUSTOMERS) are told to stay out of the ON DUTY MANAGERS way while he shoots hoops during work. Unbelievable. I wonder how corporate would feel about that?<//text>< Pictures>

Wanted to reach out to this LA fitness to sign up for Membership. Spoke with " SARAH " at front desk. VERY RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL.

Please conduct some sort of training or background  check on individuals who represent your company. Her attitude was embarrassing and the idea you allow her to answer your business line is almost comical.

i myself own a business and this type of behavior is damaging.<//text>

Been going here for 2+ years. All the equipment is old; I would like nicer equipment for the prices, location, and how busy it keeps. There are a good amount of classes if that is what you're looking for. I do not attend any, otherwise I would give a higher rating. Because the membership count is obviously adequate I think more money should be spent on upkeep and replacement of equipment.</text>

<Review>Post Covid-19 shut down and reopened for only a few days they had no one on the floor cleaning. Cleaning products for members to clean the equipment was sparse and spread out. Very poor showing. Poor management of the situation we are still living with. This gym  needs  upper management to to get invoved.<//Review>< pictures>

Okay 24.99 a month it's clean it's not bad at all, the equipment is good, the only time the employees really talk to you is when you sign up. After that they seem to ignore you and don't really care what you're doing. I wish they had staff walking around to answer any questions on how to use machines without having to hire a personal trainer< /text>

Not bad for a local Health club. Unfortunately, they took on all the members from a competitor that closed down and now it's just "PACKED" from 4:00  - 7:30pm. I go to exercise... Not stand around and wait in line for a bench or other piece of equipment.<//Text>

Excellent, motivated trainers and friendly members.
I was visiting from Canada this week and rather than use the teeny hotel gym I, tried 2 morning classes at LA Fitness because it was near my hotel.  The drop in was $15/day (not cheap but reasonable).  Jenn's Thursday class and the Spin leader on Friday were fantastic - both leaders made me feel welcome as a new participant, and the other members were friendly and clearly have a great rapport with each other.  Both classes were well formatted and allowed participants to modify exercises, weight, etc.
The only reason I gave it a 4/5 is because there were no wipes or spray bottles to clean the equipment/mats etc. This should be a no brainer.</review>

I've had nothing but excellent, caring service from all staff. I love this gym, it is very clean and pool areas are well maintained. Locker rooms are modern and clean. I've had follow up calls from staff for updates  after I fractured my leg in an accident at home. The staff are fast about addressing any questions or issues that have I've had in the past. Love this gym.</review>

Everyone works here has always been really nice and friendly. It’s always been clean and the locker room is the nicest of any of the other OC locations I’ve visited. This parking lot can get full on a week night during prime hours making you late a yoga class but my smartie pants husband found out they have extra in the back of the building with a back entrance, nice! Bonus; a Mother’s market is right next door so you can eat clean post work out!</review>

I went in to check the gym out... I wanted to visit it a couple times to see if I’d like it there. I had a online membership I was thinking of signing up for. I sat down and spoke with Samantha, she told me they could match the online price that I had... come to find out she couldn’t. So I asked if I could get a 3 day pass, she said she couldn’t give me the pass unless I signed up,for the membership that she was trying to sell me.... which was more than the online deal. I wouldn’t need the 3 day pass if I was joining. Terrible customer service.< /review>

So I recently had my credit card comprised and had to order a new card, and haven't had a chance to update my information with LA since it was recent. Well I get a phone call from Emily who called me 3 times in less than 5 minutes and left me a voicemail. Poor customer service was provided, she sounded robotic and who calls someone 3 times in a row, in a less than 5 minute time span. Completely over board and huge lack of respect that people have careers and have things going on. Someone at the branch should really coach Emily on not stalk calling people, teach her to call and leave and message and have her call returned! smh< /Review>

< review>
con artist staff. they charged my account 50$ a month and lied to me about hidden fees. they competely set me up and over drew my account every month. Abed the sales manager is a fake phony smile in your face type of guy, but is all about deception by design.

this gym has the worst most lugubrious staff and everyone there is completely complacent and dont even workout and probably haven't touched a weight in their life.

they hire unqualified FAT personal trainers but wont hire the trainers who love what they preach and actually walk the walk.

the staff here needs to all be fired because they all participate in the sub culture of pathology and antiquated memes in which they use against their members to disguise their psychotic delusions of grandeur in attempt to throw out anyone they envy in the gym.

Justin is a fat greasy slob who eats junk food at his desk all day and laughs outrageously loud and profusely.

he doesn't take his job seriously and loves to ruin peoples day.

i frequently notice him giving jealous death stares at people who actually work hard and live with purpose in the gym.

every single staff member here is actively putting on a facade to hide their overly simplistic thinking, inadequate coping skills, surface level behavior, and uncanny advice.

these people are callous, cynical, and egregious people who deserve to be slandered until they reach their death bed.</review>

<review>LA Fitness is the standard of what a great gym should be. There are plenty of machines so that you always have something to do. Thr facilities are always kept clean wheather the pool, sauna, showers, lockers, or class rooms. Overall the vibe is highly inclusive and really positive. The people working there always keep an eye out and work to keep people safe and healthy. Rlly a great experience.<//review>< pictures>

Fire ABED AND JUSTIN. Completely unqualified. Catastrophizing non issues and jumped to the most collapsed decision.

Reprehensible, scornful attitude to members. They won't hesitate to wrongly terminate anyone who has a membership with them.

There is a lot of group think collectivism within the staffs sheep minded, easily brainwashed brains.

Social injustice and inequality runs heavily off this corrupt establishment that blasts terrible music and mind numbing ads in your face.

Completely lackadaisical vibe to this place< /review>
<username>Deven Tovar</username></record></dataset><record>
<text>Fat trainers who don't know what they are doing to their clients or what they are talking about.

Psychotic bird brained staff.

Justin at the front desk and Abed the sales manager are completely unqualified with reckless discernment and are paranoid about everyone that is friendly and gregarious as being bad.

These two individuals have a limited range of emotion like psychotic retarded people. These people should be banished out of the the community.

These psychotic mutating blobs have collapsed brains catastrophizing every NON issue that arises.

These two people save face and are method actors saving face to every person they speak with. Complete people pleasing, sheep!
Paranoid conformist collectivists.

Absolutely deplorable and detestable behavior. These two mutant baboons combined with mutant humans with exaggerated self importance need to be in a mental hospital.

Disorganized behavior and misunderstandings, memory loss, anger, hyperactivity, frenzied speaking, expecting to be recognized without achievements.

It's to the expense of everybody when exaggerating their self importance at everyone else's expense.

These self aggrandizing people feel entitled to be completely fake and take advantage of other and have inability to connect with others, to relate and communicate like a mature and responsible adult like they are struggling through an ocean of cow manure.

These people have a thought terminating cliche for everything you say.

It's a huge iterating burden for them to talk to you. This is why business fail and families fail and this is why there is a collapse in colleges because nobody is learning anything.

There is a subculture of pathology within this business of low life morons.

Don't take anything they say seriously because they have no sense of self and are highly insecure and have to use a facade to hide their cynical identity.< /text>< Resp>

I had a pretty bad experience on phone with this facility.  It seems like there has been some problems with  information between my healthcare provider, silver sneakers and LA fitness. I went to the facility and  I was informed by LA fitness that my membership was cancelled by my health care provider and I should talk to them. They were nice enough to let me  use the facility that day. I did exactly what they said and  call my provider. He said my membership is active and has not been cancelled. I asked him to talk to LA fitness representative. He talked to Emily at LA fitness and  called me back and stay online as he was being given runaround. I did and I was getting the same runaround. Thus I asked her to let me talk to the manager. However, manage was not ready to talk to me and she was being pretty rude and said that she could not do anything and I just have to go to the facility when the problem is resolved. I had resolved the problem by talking to the healthcare provider and by having them call the LA Fitness facility informing them that i had the benefits. My healthcare provider felt he was being given  runaround, I thought that Emily was not listening to me and was rushing to get off the phone without resolving the issue, the manager was reluctant  to take the phone and at least say "Hi". All they wanted me to do was to come to the facility when the problem is resolved. This is not customer service. Being rude to get off the phone is total customer disservice.<//Text>

<text>To Whom This May Concern:

I am filling a formal complaint about an incident at the LA Fitness located at 5757 E Santa Ana Canyon Rd Anaheim, CA 92807 that happened at 11:00am on Friday July 19th 2013.   After being a member for several years, I was called on my personal phone by an employee and they accused me of being a thief and said they asked another member to identify me on their computer system. So they compromised my personal Identity.  The manager did not apologize. This is horrible customer service. I felt that this was racially motivated and am very disappointed at how LA Fitness handles this situation. I Thought you have policies that prevent your staff from compromising members information based on the Consumer Protect Act of United States, I feel my identity was breached. I will be sending a Certified Letter through the US Post Office to ensure my complaint was directed to the right person. I hope my complaint does not go unheard, but if it does I will pursue this till the end. You can call me to resolve this problem.

Best Regards,
Yatish N.</text>< response>

I have been a member for over 2 years and have never was late with a payment or asked the club for anything during that time.  Not even for them to wash the mildew out of the showers.  Recently my credit card number was stolen so my bank canceled my card for safety reasons.  God forbid that my payment did not go through at 8:00 AM on a Sunday morning.  They felt it was a "courtesy call" at 8:00 am on a Sunday to collect their $24.99.  Since I did not jump out of bed and get another credit card they though I needed 6 more calls and 3 email throughout the rest of the day to remind me that I was late on the payment. 2 of the calls WERE COLLECTION AGENTS!  Holly Crap for being hours late on an electronic payment for a gym membership!  These people can take the membership and shove it their corporate and shove IT!< /text>

I used to go to this gym and when I wented to cancle my membership they told me I can freez it for free no fee for 6 months. So I did that but they charged me $10 per month. I've talked to the manager about it but he was really rude and didnt help me. They charged me $50 while my account was frozed for 5 months.< /Review>

I signed up my wife to workout with me and the manager on the phone said he could sign her up for $29.99 a month, no initiation. Well come to find out, two days later they contacted me and said I had to pay initiation or they were going to cancel her membership. Bad business.</text>

<text>First time to this dispensary. It is right by my house. Tom the general manager was very helpful through the entire process. I went in with my God-mother and she got exactly what she needed as well. There was a huge selection, and reasonably priced items, that would be $10-$20 elsewhere in town. I'm usually not a fan of the recreational storefronts just because of how expensive items are. Overall the service was 5 stars. I went just to check it out initially, and ended up getting something myself. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the upper state area.<//text>< pictures>

The experience was quick, memorable and fun. So much so that I saved this card from months ago to do this review. The staff was super knowledgeable and interactive and also helped me pick the right herbs🤙🏾 Come to sedona sometime y’all< /Review>

<name>Ray o< /name><review>A good place if you don't mind a long wait time and slight cheaper prices since its a national chain dispensary. Pickup is useless since they'll help the inside customers as priority and have limited staff.  Will cancel your pickup order if they are feeling short staffed and must restart your purchase inside after rollcall. Plenty other Local Santa Barbara shops can help you in a much quicker manner.</review><user_id>106502293517536885733< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80e9156eed8f3db3:0x472ae4ce7295a2e7</gmap_id><date>1624164400151<//date>< pics>

I bought a product from them and it didn’t work. They wouldn’t exchange it even, wow! You sell bogus stuff! Never will I ever give you my money and bet that I’ll speak to anyone who will listen about avoiding you altogether. Big mistake. I’m in the business!<//Review>

Honestly the best service in Santa Bárbara no doubt! They’re very helpful with helping you find exactly what you need. They go completely out of there way to help you feel comfortable with asking questions, and don’t make you feel pressured to buy anything. Also EVERYTHING IS GAS 🔥<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>This place is a phenomenal addition to upper state st. neighborhood! On my first visit, I made a super specific request. The gentleman assisting me nailed it on the first suggestion and had 2 other options. I was honestly impressed. I dislike when I ask for X or Y at a  shop and the response is A or B. Like hi did you hear what I asked for? The guy knew exactly what I wanted! I was welcomed nicely in front and back of house. I was in and out quickly but also not rushed. Nice selection. Check em out.<//text>< pics>

<Text>Great new find on upper state!  The store is super clean and everything is set up in a logical way to easily find what you are looking for.  The staff is super friendly as well, from the front door to the cash register, my girlfriend and I were treated with the best customer service I have seen in a dispensary.  Can't wait to come back!< /Text>< gmapID>

< Review>
Great Shop. When I come in I am always greeted by the awesome security guards, Armani is always a pleasure to talk to and Nathan is extremely helpful. Both are great guys, and once you get in the shop, you can tell all the staff have been thoroughly trained. Love that they are in the upper state area, we have been needing a store in this part of town. They are a great company to work for.< /Review>

As an employee of beyond/hello I am constantly amazed and impressed at how the business is run.  Employees are treated with the utmost respect and are extensively trained on a daily basis. It is obvious that beyond/hello takes customer service very seriously and there is a clear mutual respect amongst management and staff alike. Every employee strives to make a unique and memorable experience for every single person that walks through our doors. This dispensary has a different vibe than any other I have personally been in and I cannot ask for a better or more welcoming experience.<//Text>

<text>Best storefront in town! All other local dispensaries try to rush you in and out and truly don’t care if you’re happy with what you get but not this place. Everyone of your staff is so sweet, they really take the time to make sure you like what you get and on top of that the prices here are at least 5$ cheaper than all other storefronts in town!< /text>< date>

Entering the new BEYOND - HELLO facility on Upper State was comforting and welcoming. Seeing a familiar face on the other side of the counter was a plus too.
Nice selection, good prices, a SENIOR DISCOUNT, and friendly/knowledgeable service. What's not to LIKE ?</Text>

<Text>What can I say? I’ve been a consumer of both medicinal and recreational cannabis for quite some time, sampled stores all across the southland, yet I have never experienced a dispensary quite like Beyond/Hello. We have an amazing selection of the highest quality product, in a brand new, immaculate location. At Beyond/Hello, our consultants truly value customer service and elevate the cannabis shopping experience to the next level. I love this company and I love our team.

Really clean facility, stoked about they finally got Connected/Alien Labs and Archive my favorites ! I badly want to give them a 5 star but the prices in there is the same as any other in the same city if they can do deals like 20% on a certain day for premium flower bc the rewards system sucks. didn't even get my rewards and I've been there 3 times purchased $80-$90 eights and still didn't receive any rewards. I really gotta trade distances to get the right price for what we have in town but just to pricey.< /text>

The staff at this place are all so sweet! I had a few of them stop in the restaurant I manage and drop off a good amount of coupons for our employees which we were so grateful for and I’ll definitely make sure to return the favor! Upon entering the store, I received the best experience! Everyone was so helpful and really made sure I took home product I would enjoy!!< /text>

Beyond Hello is an amazing establishment with exemplary service! Jill was so helpful and knowledgeable about all the products in the store. The shop has an excellent variety of cannabis products including tinctures, edibles, and flower. I ended up buying 8 pre rolls for lest than $30 and bunch of sativa gummies that are my new favorite edibles. Cannot recommend this place enough!!</Text>

Not this place! I can't say enough about the staff, I ended up getting more than I had intended and I'm very happy with the extra goodies they suggested. This is now my go-to place.< /Review>< pictures>

My first time visiting and shopping at beyondhello was very nice from the minute I walked in. The store was very neat and well decorated and the bud tender was very helpful when i asked him about the the prerolls and 1/8      I was also introduced to their rewards program and given they’re review card to get $25 off my next visit, that’s dope. Thanks!< /review>

Both times I’ve been to beyond hello, I’ve enjoyed it! I’ve liked the products I’ve gotten, which have included the Autumn  brand pre-rolls and Camino edibles; I’ve liked the workers I’ve encountered, they have been extremely nice and helpful; and I like the layout of the store!</Text>

I went for the first time today and was assisted by Alex, who was very knowledgeable and helpful in picking out a product. I had a surgery recently, so I need products for my pain and he was able to recommend some specific items to try. The prices were comparable to the other dispensaries in town.</text>

Great place to bring kids for a quick ice cream day. Significantly challenging for parking here. Especially if you have an SUV. But if you are safe you can navigate well and find a spot. There are two handicapped parking places and a ramp up to the doorway for wheelchair bound people. Very convenient.< /Review>

Wow, what a disappoint please don't sell any pops if you're not going to limit the sales so everyone can get a chance to buy one. I went in to buy one and the employee told me they sold all 12 to one person this morning. Hmmm 🤔 maybe someone should have limited it to per person. I won't ever buy here again Doc Bernstein's has more common sense and better ice cream.</review>

<text>The BEST place to go for Cappuccino's and Ice Cream.🍦but when it comes down to the customer's they'll skip you if they see a friend they skip you and go straight to them. And the workers play music out loud that they shouldn't play with cussing in it.</text>< gmapID>

<Review>Brought my daughter and her twi girls. She was having a bad day so I figured how could you go wrong with Baskan Robbins. So many great flavors... The staff was generous with samples for the kids. We had a great time. They have it all here from.shakes to cakes to banna splits and sundays. Sugar cones to waffle cones something for everyone. They take credit & debit cards as well as cash they haven a good size parking lot which is handicap friendly.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>Typically don't leave reviews, but I had to here. 1. Never have I once experienced a friendly happy employee at this location. Everyone always seems to have a chip on their shoulder, why? No clue. If you happen to ask a question they will become more un-friendly with you.
2. I ordered a bagel with creme cheese and avocado. It's called the CAB. This cost with tax $9.15. That is insane to me. A regular creme cheese and bagel is $3.75 and avocado and lemon pepper cost $5!?. Definitely a rip off. They don't even have specialty bagels or specialty creme cheeses. Just plain for both and an everything. Can't charge people that much when your items are so basic.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

This location is tucked away on PCH but is such a delight.. The workers are sweet and overall the food and drink quality is high. Coffee isn't my favorite drink but the LVTM is a great choice for people like me!!< /Review>

What a great selection of lattes and toast. Omg. Home is the perfect spot for a perfectly made latte. They have all the usual classic espresso drinks, but they're definitely known for their creative, more specialized drinks. I ordered the lavender latte with soy milk and I was so pleased. There was the perfect amount of foam, art work was gorgeous, and not too sweet. The aroma of lavender was light and not too overwhelming.< /review>

Cute atmosphere, delicious coffee, and good options for both drinks and foods! We stopped by here before hitting the beach and got two large coffees, but one came back small. They remade it but didn't notice until I flagged someone down and asked. I'll definitely go back if I'm in the area though since it's delicious!< /text>

Came for a weekend walk and walked into this coffee shop. Small with limited sittings both inside and out. Friendly customer service, good coffee, and good breakfast. Had their quiche, avocado boat (scoop of tuna in half avocado, spicy Mayo sprout, cracked pepper, and bacon bits) and delicious latte (which I added some cinnamon powder on the top). Free wi-fi available too.</review>

Usually pretty amazing - but sometimes inconsistent. Every so often you'll get an overly sweet or under flavored drink. But when it hits it slaps.<//Text>

< Review>
Love the coffee and generally the people.  However, they have decided that masks are not required, despite the regulation in Laguna requiring masks be worn in retail establishments.  Went in Saturday and found many customers there without masks.  Asked the staff and they told me they no longer required masks no matter what Laguna said.  I turned to speak with a customer without a mask, asking why no mask, and was told by the staff to stop hassling the customers.  Was then called an a-hole by one of the male customers....Anyway what happened next is another story.  But no more Black Dot for me.<//Review>

<review>I was just looking for a coffee place near the beach with parking. I ended up finding this on google maps as the closest coffee shop near me. The cafe itself is very clean and modern. Lattes are my favorite and I noticed they had one called the Laguna Latte. When I saw them start making the drawing at the top of the latte I became concerned that this place would just end up being a gimmicky coffee shop. I was very wrong. The Laguna Latte is by far the best latte I've ever had. It's like honeycomb in latte form. Definitely coming back.< /review><Date>1523117248296</Date>< Gmap_id>

<review>I love the location of this place. It is away from the busy part of Laguna Beach. Sometimes during the day parking might be a problem. The staff is always smiling and service is pretty fast. They have a small selection of fresh pastries. I tried croissants several times and they taste fresh and not too buttery.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dce430c642b893:0xe62b84f1ab2faee9</gmap_id></record>

Blk door is a sweet spot. Neighborhood cafe with excellent Vietnamese coffee prepared as your favorite espresso drink - my flat white was superb. I didn't try their pastries, but the various breakfasts on farmer toast are delicious and ample.
My go-to place in Laguna Beach.</Review>

It's great if they ever have anything in stock.  I called today, instead of the 5 pervious times I went physically to get a bagel, they have fantastic breakfast options, but they are always out of stock, so today was the 6 time in a row they were completely out of bagels.  How can you have a store that is always out of things.</text>

<text>What a great little coffee shop with friendly employees and a great selection of Coffees and Teas. I didn't have any food here but they have a great healthy selection of various toasts, sandwiches, and some pastries. Also a few grab and go items on the side. Not a lot of sitting space but I was able to claim a table and set up my workspace and hung out here for about 2 hours. Will come here again if I'm in the area and need a spot to set up shop< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dce430c642b893:0xe62b84f1ab2faee9<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Amazing spot! Feels like a locals spot with authentic Vietnamese coffee and home baked pastries

Must try - BLK Dot Ice Coffee (speciality Vietnamese coffee - just imagine harnessing the power of 5 energy drinks combined with the deliciousness of melted coffee ice cream). Secret - Order the large and take it home to save and enjoy over a period of a few days (it refrigerates well).

The prices some some of the speciality drinks and pastries a little high (hence the 4 stars compared to 5). Nevertheless, this place is definitely worth visiting and adding to your radar!</Text>

Lady that was doing my nails was so rude to me and treated me like I was nobody I will never go back here again when I asked her name she said she can’t tell me and when I asked for owner she said she never comes to this location and to top it off she said she don’t work here and was just so rude to me. Don’t go here save your time and money for someone that treats you fare. Other lady that was there and heard her Angelina was her name ugh I’m so annoyed with the customer service they gave me</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>It’s hard to find a good nail spa that has a beautiful interior as well as great nail technicians, but that’s why I love to visit Queen Bee every time I’m in town....today I wanted something custom, creative, long and fun! Thankfully I was paired with the perfect person...Vivian! She had a wonderful vibe and took her time paying attention to detail and I could tell she really knew what she was doing. All I had to do was show her some pictures to give her an idea of what I wanted and she took my idea and turned it into a masterpiece! My favorite thing about Vivian is that she loves what she does and it shows in her work. I will definitely make sure I visit her every time I’m in town....thanks again Viv, I love ya and everyone at Queen Bee!<//text>< Pictures>

I’ve been coming to Queen Bee since they opened years ago.  They were one of the few places open on Sundays back in the day.  It is under new management/ownership and they’ve made a few changes and things are really good.  I like the options in services, they stay current on colors, styles, etc.< /Text>

I avoid negative reviews but when they are deserving I go all in: This place is deceptive when u look at how cute the decor and fancy chairs are when u first walk in. That's where the money goes- it seems, not into the training. Cut my fingers up w the drummel tool. Didn't cover my toes with polish, it looks like my child did my pedicure. I asked that they push my cuticles back and i guess that was comparable work to pulling teeth. To shape my nail how I wanted was ten dollar extra. I asked for ombre glitter on one nail per hand: 4 dollars extra per nail: looking very lumpy & not hombre! Not cute. I left with cuts/blood on 4 fingers.< /review>

They have changed owners and it has a different feel to it. I didn't care for the music they were playing. The girl doing my pedicure did a good job but the one that did my nails didn't make the french tips very straight. I think I'll have to look for a new place to go.<//text>

<review>The scenery was nice when I first entered and when I got to the front desk I asked if there was a charge for coffin shape nails and was told "no " but once I sat in the chair the lady told me there was a charge for shape.Did not have a problem with the extra $5 but I would have liked a consistent answer. Besides one nail the shaping came out decent. Its been two weeks and already need a fill used to my nails lasting at least up to 3weeks.The attitude of the employees was friendly at first but I was not pleased with how they were speaking about the other customer's style preference saying "that style is in the bay area not here" plan to look in the area to see if there is a nail salon that does better.<//review>< response>

The last time I was here, my daughter and I had our eyebrows waxed. The lady burned my daughter. When she told her that it was too hot, the lady argued and said it wasn't. We left before she was done. That night her eyebrows were scabs. Her wedding was in four days. Thank goodness for Neosporin and good makeup. It wasn't noticeable at her wedding.<//review></record></dataset><record>

My pedicure was a little painful too. After all that I wasn't even offered the massage chair to be on. Maybe an extra charge? Lol Then when I went to pay I gave my debit card and the man seen I had cash and requested cash! Never again!</Review><Rating>1</Rating>< pics>

<Review>I went there to get a full set, and I was so disappointed. I don't know the name of the man who did my nails, but I won't be going back. He dug into my nail bed so deep that it's finally grown out. I told him it was burning but he didn't change his technique. A couple of the nail tips weren't even secured properly to my nail, there were gaps where acrylic had gotten between my nail and the nail tip he put on. I found it to be pricy for such a shoddy job.< /Review>< pics>

<text>I went and got my nails and eyebrows done with my friend. First they made our eyebrows uneven and not shaped the same. Secondly not even two days after we got our nails done they broke. Today being the third day i had another one fly off without a fight. I dont even want to give them a star but i have to. So just so you guys no do not go here for nails or euenrows what so ever was not worth the 45$ we spent for a set of acrylic nails.<//text>< time>

The place has truck scales so after three years of RV towing I finally know what my rig weighs.  It seems we did ok getting rid of stuff for the transition to full time RV and location independent living.< /text>< Pics>

Highly overpriced items, with no bathroom available. Was going to get gas and a soda here, but the shopkeeper was rude when I asked for the bathroom. Go elsewhere if possible.<//Text>

Around 5 30 pm  enjoy a great soul dinner. The ownership let me stay at the restaurant until closing time 8pm. The ownership treat me like family. I will take my friends there and enjoy there great soul Kitchen again. I am from a big family of 7 brothers we love to eat good home cooking food like Stella's Soul kitchen.

<review>When it comes to true Southern Cooking, Stella's Soul Kitchen got a lot of these mom & pop truly beat. A warm and comfortable place to eat or pop in & out. Excellent taste, fall off the bone tender. Welcome home greetings like us Southerners.

<Review>Been there several times. The food is good and the portions are fairly descent. Sides are smaller, but the main dish is more than enough. Best soul food around these parts.
I am not sure where Ana ate, but the furniture all matches. It is a small place and has no air conditioning, but I don't think it is "ghetto." They play oldies, which keeps it mellow.</Review>< Pics>

Food was amazing. I came here Sunday with my sisters and ordered the fried chicken dinner with a side of mac n cheese and greens. The fried chicken was well seasoned, moist, and fresh off the fryer. The mac n cheese was cooked to perfection and the greens were divine. I definitely will come back.<//Text>

<text>The fried catfish was fabulous...some of the best I have ever had and I am from Texas where we catch and cook it fresh. The yams were yummy, too. If you blink, you could miss finding this place. Make a special trip there. You won't be disappointed.</text>< Pictures>

I have eaten here several times.  The food is consistently good. I get the catfish, yams and macaroni and cheese. They cut the catfish into small pieces instead of the big hunks that most places give.  I love that! (I only gave 4 stars because the cornbread is not that yummy.)< /Review>

Dissapointed. The oxtail dinner dish is not all that. Definitely NOT worth the charge of over $18!!!
I value it at no more than $14 maximum!
Mac n cheese was hella greasy and looked like someone threw up mac noodles on a small bowl.
I should've went for a simpler dish like ribs, or catfish or something like that. But the big cashier guy said it's worth the money, when it really wasn't.< /text>

I just had the two way oxtails and fried catfish. Man that was good and right on time after seeing girls trip with my wife. I tell people it's not about the ambiance it's about that good ass food. A lil salty on the gravy but I don't eat out often. Nice place to just eat a meal and focus on the food. The waiter is a nice guy with good dad jokes. LOL.<//text>

Oxtails are the best, chicken and fish are great. Only gripe really is that it's expensive and a bit of a wait if you don't call ahead. But for food of this quality it's worth it and more.< /Text>

<review>I don't normally rate restaurants.  I'm giving them a three with the benifit of the doubt that they may have had someone call in sick.  To make a long story short, get take out.  The service in the resturant was Horrible!  The catfish and fried chicken were good, but the cornbread was dry and the mac&cheese tasted more like margerine than cheese.  Overall not what I expected given the reviews.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The portions are small for the price. The ox tails were very salty. The cabbage was brown and did not taste like cabbage at all. The black eye peas were just OK. 18 dollars was way to much for this plate.</Review></record>

<review>Im only giving them 3 stars coz when im about to come back for my other car to be tinted...they offered me a very high price. Im not sure why, it seems like they don't take care of their customers that comes back 🤷🏽‍♂️ so I went ahead and looked for another shop.< /review>< gmapID>

They are picky, they only do full set tinting. Came in to have only my front side windows tinted. The guy said he doesn't do that, the whole vehicle had to be tinted "full set service only."
Took my business elsewhere.</Text>

<text>I came here today and I was very nervous because I called just this morning went in like I'm 20 min after . I went to the store and came back just to make sure the tint was going to look ok... I didn't want to ruin my new Mercedes :/ It turned out really really good . I honestly never write reviews bc I don't have time . But I called another place earlier and they lost out on business bc they just couldn't accommodate me today . But the tint is amazing the car looks awesome ; I got limo in the back , dark in the two front ! Really easy and friendly . I would refer everyone here .< /text>< name>

<Review>Love this Peruvian restaurant, service and food is really really good. I recommend the Saltado mixto, really good food if you love shrimp, steak and chicken all in one plate.<//Review>< Pictures>

I was expecting good food for the amount of reviews but the place is horrible for the portion of size the traditional green sauce is horrible no where near the taste. I would not recommend especially when your craving good food.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Have been here a few times, have gotten various dishes, lomo saltado, tallarines, papa a la huancaina and of course the ceviche. All great, prices are fair the food is delicious I am Mexican so not an expert at all on Peruvian food , and we tend to be harder critics on our own food, but thank god we have it here in the valley. Good job guys and thank you. By the way my girl is Gluten Free/ Celiac and the ceviche is a safe choice just mentioned no roasted corn kernels on the ceviche.

The food was ok. No Bread, they gave us Tostados which it is ok.  The food we gad was busted a lo pobre the bistec is a small piece of horrible meat and half of the meat is fat and un beatable grease. The service was good and it was served fast.</text>

The food here was great, and the waitresses were eager to please. You could tell that it was important to them for non-Peruvian diners to like their food.

The location doesn't quite do this place justice, because even though it looks like a place from which you're more likely to buy take-out, the food itself is excellently cooked and presented.

I had what the waitress recommended, and it was right. I'll be back.<//text>

Similar to the taco Bell of Mexican food.  We will not be going there again. We ordered 2 ceviches, 3 lomo saltado a lo pobre, yucca frita, 3 tamales, anticuchos and papa a la huacaina and they didn't give us not 1 aji! Not 1!<//Text>< Pics>

I ordered the "Lomo Saltado" the flavor was not as authentic as other places and a little salty from too much soy sauce. The portion was quite small too, normally I can take a little bit home. I arrived at a slow hour and there was only one waitress who also handle the register and had to go to the business next door to make change. My lucuma ice cream was served in a water glass. Overall it's a clean, decent, and local, but not as authentic as I am used too.</text>

Loved the wantan soup, light and flavorful. The cau de pollo was delish! Price was a little high for what you get and the service was meh.

Hence why they didn't get the last star. And the restaurant was also hot! Too hot for a hot day! But the food is worth it I suppose<//text>

I'm sorry for them if they want to stay in the restaurant market, they have to maintain their quality, they can't sell us cat for a hare, but the last time I went, I asked for a cause. shrimp each, the one from the living I ordered a steak from the poor a sole of hard shoe the meat that I do not have to return again, that of the live the Creole.

KFC was a great drive-through quick stop on our way through Lakeport the other night.

Customer service was fast, friendly and professional.

The food was fast, hot and hit the spot for our munchies.

I highly recommend stopping here if you're looking for a quick inexpensive bite to eat.

Thank you.

<Rate>2</Rate><review>Well...though the line was out to the street, it moved fairly quickly. Ordering was smooth, at least until we asked to swap the included cookies in our meals for biscuits instead (never an issue with Ukiah KFC). Lady taking order said that wasn't possible, no biggie. So we asked how much to add biscuits and we were told $2.49 for 2 biscuits, and $.59 for one....

Huh?

We asked why the bug price difference, and she  told us "Because there's TAX"
😶

I like KFC, but this particular spot has a bad drive-thru set up. If its crowded your chances of being stopped on the street is highly likely, and it's dangerous. Your dedication to have chicken for dinner has to be solid for that type of risk. I've done it, but don't always have the nerves or patience for it. Other than that, no complaints on the service or food...< /Text>

The food always good, sometimes a bit of a wait, but worth it. Service is good. Over all nice place. Like their "chicken bowls"

First drive thru food during covid days, the lines were outrageous at taco bell, burger king, so we said hey, let's go to KFC, only 1 in line.  Got our order fast, was so delicious!  Never can go wrong with their chicken!<//review>

When you get the 5 dollar box it would be helpful if the one piece of chicken is worth it. Not a small piece. The potato wedges arent always fresh. It is a clean place and they do have a nice staff.< /Review>

<date>1572675766516< /date><text>Tonight there were five of us who went inside for dinner. There was water on the floor in the rear dining room with a yellow plastic ⚠️ . The employees had to walk around it when they brought out our food but not one employee mopped it up. Then when you think it can’t get worse, the restroom 🚺 was filthy and appalling. There was no soap in the receptacle and it appeared it had not been cleaned at all during that shift. Let’s all hope we don’t get sink because evidently the employees are not using soap.< /text>< Name>

We bought 2 buckets of chicken of the 16 pieces and it took them for ever to give us the order I had to go and ask a couple of times if it was ready and when they gave us the order we where missing 2 of our sides. And the place is dirty the costumer service is not the best .< /text>

We saw there $5.00 add and decided it had been a while since we last eat KFC. So we went through the drive thru and ordered the Chicken bowl, and the Three piece chicken tender meal. Both only $5.00 dollars right now. We both enjoyed our meals and where very pleased with the price of lunch for two people. The service was fast and friendly.<//Review>

The food was great, but I used the restroom, and they use a hand dryer instead of paper towels. I really don't like touching a bathroom door before I eat, because there will always be people who don't wash their hands. So I'm really grossed out.<//Text>

<review>I've been to this location a few times...never again.   The first couple times of them messing my order up I chalked it up to them being busy.  This time, 2 cars in the drive thru and noone inside.  I asked for them to go light on the gravy on my "famous bowl" and I feel like they tried to troll me by doing 3 times the normal amount of gravy.... Crazy!!!</review><rate>1<//rate><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

I just went thru drive thru and ordered a super bowl with extra gravy and corn. They gave me the extra corn but did not give me any gravy! I live like 20 minutes away, so I called to let them know but no one answered.< /Text>

One of the worst KFC's I've ever been to had to wait in line in the Drive-Thru for about 20 minutes to get second-rate food. It made me late for concert in the park at library Park I was very disappointed I recommend everybody go someplace else.</Review>

Very disappointed at the parts department. My backpack was stolen while traveling and it had one of the key fob's in it. I bought this MINI only 3 months ago at this dealership and this dealership quoted me $540.00 for a replacement.
I was going to be in Phoenix the next week, so I called a dealership in the area and what a difference. What a difference in customer service as well. They were sorry to hear what happened and quoted me $340.00 plus tax. This is for the exact programmed key fob.
Thank you so much to Alex @  MINI of Tempe!

With that being said about the parts department, Rocky in sales was great to work with. Everything discussed on the phone before getting to the dealership was spot on when arriving at the dealership.< /Review>

Not our first time buying a car, not even our first time at a BMW/MINI dealership, but definitely our first time feeling so good about the whole experience. Javier helped us pick the car, we had a fun genuine and simply human conversation about life, cars, music and some more cars :) Any questions we had he answered in great detail, when he made suggestions he brought up pros and cons and straight up told us when certain things didn’t make sense for our particular situation and needs, which, by the way, he took great care in finding out first.
Not once did we feel like we were being sold something, or pushed something that we didn’t need or didn’t come there for. And the crazy thing, the same trend continued as we went to sign papers and talk about additional services and packages. Rafi was helping us in the office and showed us a detailed breakdown of pros and cons of each service in a very concise way to avoid wasting anybody’s time and gave us fantastic deals on the few services that we did want to get. Again, just simple, genuinely nice experience. These guys are total rockstars and we couldn’t recommend them enough. This is how buying cars should feel like.< /text>

I have purchased 2 new Minis here for my personal use:  A 2015 Coupe S and a 2021 2 door Hardtop S.  Fun and fabulous vehicles- I've never had one problem.  Great sales and finance staff.  Be sure to ask for Javier! I got excellent deals on both of the cars along with high dollar amounts for my trade-ins.</Text>

<Text>First class experience from the entire team. I had done my research and knew I was getting a great price on a used Countryman S so I booked a flight from Boise.  Rocky made arrangements for me to be picked up at airport.

Transaction completed  in less than an hour and I was on the road.

Sales manager Rocky Chow helped us get our 2020 Cooper S, and was helpful from start to finish. Explained everything six ways to Sunday, and helped us pick the packages we needed to suit our needs. The selection is limited due to COVID, but they can order you vehicles from out of state too. 10/10 would recommend getting a Mini here, and always ask for Rocky!</review>

<Review>I was going to meet with Rocky Chow today Sunday the 14th  to see a 2018 certified Mini Hardtop Cooper S, and we were communicating yesterday via text.Today, I have been texting him several times to make an appointment, so I could drive to the dealership to see the car in question, and others pre-owned/certs,  that also caught my eye in your website, but no response yet to any of my texts.
Is this is the way  your dealership  do business ?
Well, I'll take my business elsewhere that I would be respected as a potential buyer.

Sincerely,
Pedro Luis Campos</Review>< Pictures>

I purchased a new 2020 Mini Countryman S from Javier; it is the second Mini I have bought from him. Why, because he is the ultimate professional, gentleman and made this experience even greater than the first. Genuine and authentic, he is why we came back.  And it will be the reason for the next one, next time.  Thanks Javier.</text>

I had a couple of items needing repairing on my Mini that were under warranty. I made an appointment and took the car in. I talked with De about what needed to be done and along with the repairs he noted my next service was due next month and advised to get it done now and save a trip. They let me use a loan car since the repairs and service would take a couple of days. When my car was repaired and serviced I received a call to pick it up. All repairs were competed along with the service. I have been very satisfied with the service department and De at Mini of Monrovia.< /text>

<Review>Long-time MINI owner and customer at MINI of Monrovia so it is with serious disappointment that I share this review re: my most recent experience (Oct. 2020). Dropped car off on a Friday for diagnostic with understanding that would need to leave it over night. However, did not receive any direct communication (phone call or text) on Saturday giving me a status update. I called and no one answered, so I left a message asking that someone return my call and provide me with an update. No one returned my call and since they are closed on Sunday, I was without a car for the entire weekend. This is HIGHLY unprofessional. I called first thing Monday morning, again had to leave a message and once I received a call back was informed that the needed part had to be ordered and would be in that day. There is no reason this update should not have been provided to me on Saturday. When I eventually picked up my car, they had not washed my car either (which is supposedly a standard service provided anytime you bring your car in). I am thoroughly disappointed in the way this service center is operating and will take my regular service needs elsewhere from now on.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2d909325926bd:0x82e7b2e529d9a10<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Rocky is amazing!! Very helpful and energetic!! He made the process of buying a new car simple and enjoyable.  For being the only employee working this day, he handled a very busy time like a Champ. Great personality and guest service!!</Review>

I had a great experience with the folks at Mini of Monrovia. Dehaun Choi was very helpful and worked diligently to help me with repair work and outside warranty company issues. Thanks D. You guys are great.</text>

I am exceptionally happy with the service I received at the Mini dealership of Monrovia. I had gone to another Mini dealership in Southern California (based on reviews)  and was extremely disappointed with the service I had received. The Mini dealership of Monrovia took their time to get to know me and my credit history. They were strategic when finding banks to help finance the car I wanted. Most importantly, they made me a better offer on my APR, they beat the APR that my teacher credit union was offering me. If you are going to buy a Mini then the dealership in Monrovia is the one you want to go to. Exceptional in every aspect! I love my Mini!<//Text>

<Review>Josh Tsiu made our time at the Mini of Monrovia a very welcoming, Super friendly, very professional and helpful experience. We really enjoyed Josh for the time that he spent and made us feel at home. We are more than excited to work with josh again because of the way he explained each and every detail on the book about a car, making sure no detail was missed before purchasing, to also ensure that we are going in the right direction for a reliable car. The drive test was so exciting as well, allowing us to get the feel of the car and explaining what are the features inside. Josh is your man to go! We hope you see this, we are very grateful for the experience! Thank you again!</Review>< Rating>

Took my car here, and liked that they actually took the time to see what was wrong with my car even though it took awhile to get my car back, I know they made sure everything was good to go, even got a loaner which made everything easier. Thanks to the service team!!</Text>

Freaking rats eat the cables in my Mini. I took it to Mini of Monrovia where they found the problem quickly. The process was long because it required a full inspection of the vehicle, plus ordering a bunch of parts. Jason, the technician associated to my case was very responsive all the time, keeping me updated at every step. The car was fixed timely as soon as the parts were available. Great service overall!<//Review>

I made an appointment for 12:30 and arrived on time. The service was brake fluid and oil change. I did not get my car until 2:50 pm. Additionally, I've kept my rear bumper spotless for three years, and sure enough the car was returned with a small mark on it, which I discovered 24 hours later. I am considering leasing another MINI; now, however, I'm inclined to look into other brands where the level of dealership service is timely and competent.  I will not be returning to this dealership.

UPDATE 9/2020

I am reducing my rating from two stars to one, because I am pestered by unwanted emails from MINI of Monrovia, despite repeated efforts to unsubscribe. I advise future visitors not to share your email address with this dealership.<//review>

at mini BMW Monrovia  the team of associates that work in the service department the service advisors and the service manager made my mini cooper dream a nightmare. when i had service done on my mini cooper just recent. aside from the problem that had to be repaired. the service department workers damaged my mini cooper some how. the service manager with his 'i don't care attitude" denies breaking my mini cooper and then the service manager called me a lair. and  told me that mini was not going to pay for the damages that they done to my mini cooper. i have been waiting for someone from the service department to reach out to me. they still have not responded back.< /text>

" Found an amazing Mini @ a great price point... No hassle on pricing: everything in that department was on point !
Brandon did a great job as a sales rep keeping us entertained through the grueling paperwork nightmare of buying a car in So Cal! Would recommend him and the dealership to whoever is in the BMW / Mini mindset!< /review>

<review>Been talking to every sales rep possible in the LA area looking for a lease. Rocky was the only one who would give me straight answer with the drive off price of the vehicle, exactly as advertised, unlike all the other dealerships that tacked on other excessive dealership, documentation, and acquisition fees. The dealership was open during this COVID situation and the staff that I saw all had on masks. They did have limited stock, but were very upfront with pricing and the exact values on paper. With negotiations, they didn't do the usual "let me go ask my manager" and disappear for 20 minutes and come back with a "no sorry" and waste your time. Rocky and Ray were in front of me as me negotiated and was showing me their calculations as they input them in the computer and could tell me yes or no within minutes. Rocky was always willing to ask for my prices, unlike other sales who would tell me "no this is a great deal already" and try to tell me otherwise. Highly recommend working with them.<//review>< Pictures>

Typically the car buying/leasing process is usually never easy, It's usually a daunting process to be honest...

But luckily, me and my wife had an amazing experience with Javier, he was by far the most detail oriented and knowlegable salesman I've ever purchased from. My wife contacted him prior to us arriving to save time and be courteous considering the whole Covid-19 sitch,  and as soon as we arrived Javier greeted us and made us laugh with a couple aswesome stories he told us, answered all the questions we had knowledably while never over forcing the sale. He's a genuine dude for sure, and would HIGHLY recommend you choose to work with him when shopping here!

The whole Mini of Monrovia team handled the entire process with a high sense of professionalism and were super down to earth at the same time, who could ask for a better experience:)

Thank you again Javier, me and Adriana truly appreciated your service...<//review>

Excellent customer service, Advisor, Choi.   Brought my Clubman in due to a sensor light.  Paperwork process from checking in car and rental was quick and efficient.  Communication status of car through text and email was appreciated. Car was done within 48 hours.  Advisor Choi did offer additional services for present and future considerations regarding the care on my Clubman, thank you.  Well done.</review>

My car was making a choppy/stuttering sound and I was due for an oil change so I brought it into service. Jason was my service advisor and I told him my concerns with the engine/loud sound. I also asked him to check for anything else that I needed to change (i.e. fuel filters) but he told me that MINI usually has good fuel filters but that he would still advise service to check it anyways. Jason also assisted me with the car loaner department and when I expressed concern about when I should drive back or how long my car would take, he reassured me that he would keep me updated on the progress and to keep the loaner car as long as I had needed during service. Later Jason texted me and said that we had a faulty thermostat and the water pump pulley was missing a chunk. His explanation was detailed and very helpful for me to understand, as I don't know much about cars. The next day I got a message saying that my car was ready but Jason told me to wait another day because he wanted to make sure that the oil change was done in addition to the other work. He was very helpful throughout the whole process and I would recommend him as a service advisor to anyone who has a MINI.</review>

Jason is my consultant who is professional and friendly. On this Black Friday morning, we have an recall appointment, he arranged a nice loan car during the service, and service is fantastic and faster than I thought, more service completed than request, what I can say, I am lucky to have this consultant and dealer to service me almost 3 years, thanks for all !<//text>

Been going to the BMW of Monrovia for my BMWs. Mini of Monrovia is no different. They delivered a great service and exceptional staff. Always give an honest feedback. Will definitely return for my Cooper needs.</Text>

He was never pushy like the other sales people I dealt with at other dealerships. He even got me the black mini I wanted and got my monthly payments close to what I wanted. I thought I’d have to sell my old mini myself, but josh suggested we come in and still try and see what the trade in would be and they got me what I thought I’d get!! I was so happy! Loved everything about this dealership and will come back and recommend to anyone looking for a mini. Thank you Josh!!!</Text><response>None</response>< userid>

Took a while but that is okay they told us ahead of time. The dealership is always so clean.
It was nice to run into the guys who helped sell us two of our cars, they are always so sweet. Our car was nice and clean when we got it back which was a plus. Overall it was a very good experience and you are all doing a great job, thank you.< /review>

I came in because I got an email for a recall on my vehicle and since the moment I walked in I was greeted really fast and told what to expect. I was told that needed to wait since there were other customers waiting so I asked to be shuttle back to work but they offered me a rental which it was amazing service thank you so much for that.<//Review>

<Text>Update 03/16/2019
Management at BMW & Mini of Monrovia, found out about the service we received from Sonic Automotive sales associate Rocky. Management felt so bad, they contacted us directly and apologize profusely. In addition they set the car aside, washed it, filled the car with gas and made the purchase quick and easy. The service at BMW of Monrovia and the staff, especially Management were great.

Horrible car buying experience! Contacted Rocky at Mini of Monrovia regarding a car. I was told the price was firm but then watched it drop four times. Asked some questions regarding safety & the condition since it was different than advertised & just put off. Then I drove 75 miles to see the car which was not as described (condition & accidents). I did let him know that I needed my wife to see it & would be back Sunday. Drove all the way out again and was told they had someone coming to look at it (not sold). Very poor customer service & follow through. A contact would be nice before having traveled all that way & go with a sale before just someone looking at it. Start to finish a bad experience!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Great experience with leasing a new car.  Abby Barrientos really took care of me.  She remembered me even though I hadn't returned in months.  She also remembered which car and color I liked.  After I looked at their inventory and test drove a few cars, she knew I wasn't happy.  When she couldn't find the one I wanted, she checked the loaner car status, and there it was in the adjacent BMW lot, my perfect Mini Cooper.  I love my Mini Cooper.  It's the cutest car I've ever had.  Couldn't be happier.< /Text><user_name>Olga Rodriguez</user_name>< resp>

Rocky was incredibly patient with me (& my energetic, bouncy child) as we discussed my vision.

<text>Customer service center of BMW of Monrovia was very helpful. They provided roadside assitance phone number for me to call since my car wouldnt start and was offered a shuttle service also the person there had rescheduled my service appointment. Had I not called to confirm about the appointment I wouldnt have known whether to call for roadside to tow my car into the mini cooper dealership.  I can only say I was dissapointed to not have my car washed since I had my car serviced.
As a tip I would suggest advising clients to provide roadside service phone number and let them know that they need to schedule the pick up along with service at the dealership. I was assuming I'd receive a call back from Mini Cooper to ask and have a tow truck scheduled for pick up.</text><Resp>None<//Resp><userid>106669694276457688993< /userid>< date>

Recently had some work done on my daughter's 2008 Clubman.  There were a couple difficult issues as one can imagine with a ten year old car.  But Rudy Sanchez stepped up and made sure everything worked out for us.  He went out of his way to make sure we were happy with the results...and we are.  I feel he really cared about our situation and the fact that my daughter really loves this car and I can not say thank you enough for the customer service...no, customer CARE he provided and continues to provide.  I would be extremely happy to recommend this dealer to anyone and look forward to doing business there in the future.  Rudy, I am grateful more than you could know for your attention and help with our situation and making my girl so happy.  You are a huge asset to your company.< /Text>

BMW of Monrovia was a pleasure to do  business with.  Everyone I had contact with was well trained and very pleasant.  BMW of Monrovia is by far a more professional experience than my local BMW dealer.  I had to drive 180 miles from my home to meet with the staff at BMW of Monrovia, but it was worth the drive.  Not only did I get a better deal on my new car I also felt that the details of my trade in, and the purchase were taken car of properly.< /Text>

They gave me all the information I wanted and looked stuff up when they didn't know. (To be fair I was buying a trade in truck at a mini dealership so not knowing everything about the truck was fair)

I knew it was going to go well when I called ahead and asked the sales person  to bring the truck to the front and he brought two similar trucks to the front. Didn't even have to walk inside, he was waiting for me. (Thanks Javier)

I'm not 100% on the financing guys. I asked for the details on the extended warranty and he sent me the sales brochure instead of the details.  There aslo is some confusion about working with my bank. I have a lot of faith that'll be cleared up without too much extra effort. None of that stopped me from driving the truck home so minor hiccup in an otherwise excellent experience.

I live in LA and would drive to Monrovia to deal with this dealership again. Thanks guys.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2d909325926bd:0x82e7b2e529d9a10<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I had been in communication with a sales agent for about a week regarding a specific MINI that I saw online and fell in love with. The sales agent was super helpful and did everything to create the best deal for me. The MINI was detailed and ready when I showed up for my test drive and the terms of the deal were exactly as negotiated. The process was smooth, I didn't feel pressured or rushed and the MINI is amazing!<//Text>

He knew his job well & my sales experience with him was efficient and memorable. (The only thing I’d add that since I went on a weekend, the finance part of the car buying experience had a long wait so I’d encourage the dealership to have more financial personnel on staff on a busy Sunday). Other than that, it was a great experience and I’d recommend this dealership with its friendly salesman (Brian W) & the huge selection they have is awesome.

This is by far the best Service Dept. I've ever been too!! Matt Clark was my service adviser and I can't tell you what a relief it was to have someone so honest.  I went to another "convenient for me" BMW dealership before, and boy, did I get ripped off :(.  Matt was sooo kind, helpful and honest and did not try to persuade me into anything, he just stated the facts.  Even though Monrovia is quite a trek for me... I will never go anywhere else!!  Also, I have to say that Bruce Harris is awesome as well!! We've been buying our cars from him for years!!! He is one of the most honest, kind and caring people I've met.  He goes the extra mile to make sure you have a fabulous experience when purchasing your car, no last minute surprises and he even delivered my car to my home.. wow, what service!!

Love this place!!!<//Review>

<Text>The customer service at this dealership is a circus. I had to call SIX times and talk to NINE people (at least half of these "people" were voicemails that never called me back... it has been more than a week at this point) to schedule a repair appointment. I only went here because I had no other choice due to the nature of the repair. I took my car here a few years ago and was treated so poorly I just left without the service and did not ever intend on going back. I felt judged and disrespected as a young female with a BMW. They treated me like I was incompetent and expected to be able to rip me off. Little do they know I am currently pursuing a doctoral degree. Looks can be deceiving. When I reluctantly returned for my recent appointment, Matt was really helpful and kind. If you go here, request an appointment with Matt. They did a good job with the service and cleaned the outside of my car for no additional charge which I really appreciated. I will still go elsewhere when I can (oil changes or simple repairs), but when I do go to the dealership I will be dealing with Matt. The man who shuttled me from the dealership when my car was being worked on was very kind, and the young man who greeted me in the service department was also very nice. The problem here is what goes on outside the service department. I would rate the service department 5/5 but I would rate the secretaries/those who answer the phones and schedule appointments a generous 1/5.<//Text>< pics>

<review>My vehicle was in need of an oil change.  To my surprise, I was able to make an appointment that same morning online and drove myself right in.  Service was great.  I love dealing with professionals.  All services to be performed were itemized clearly on a printout.  I waited for about 2 hours and received my vehicle on time and washed.  Even though my warranty/maintenance had already expired, I still brought it in to the dealer because I believed in their work.  Highly recommended.</review><name>Toto Wang< /name><Date>1530550634109<//Date>< resp>

I requested a test drive from online and they contacted me immediately and scheduled an appointment next day.
We only spent less than 30 minutes over all to get the deal done. The fleet manager Tracy was super nice and she never play games on the numbers and will give you the best deal in the market.
I have purchased/leased 5 vehicles within 6 years and this time is the fastest and smoothest.
Highly recommend this BMW dealership< /review>< GmapID>

The service for this dealer is always "A" for effort, but the execution leads something to be desired. My car was with them for 2 and a half days trying to diagnose a loss of power at acceleration.

Their initial diagnosis of my car was incorrect, or mistakenly told to me. Luckily I know a little about cars and I could tell something was wrong. After the a half day more they told me what seemed to be an applicable issue.

That still took a day to fix, which was only replacing spark plugs. Overall I was without my car for 3 days. I feel that my friends that go to other dealers have better experiences.

And also as an unrelated side note: the people who work here seem a little "weird". Not in a quirky-fun way...but in a "there's a gas leak" or something way. It's always been something I've noticed. I don't know how you feel about it, but it's a little off-putting. I'm going to try a different dealer future things.<//text>

Unfortunately this will be the last time I bring my car to this dealership. I specifically dropped off my car with 2 distinct codes, when I picked up the car the code was still present. I promptly alerted the service dept, days later I finally get a response stating the codes weren't present at the time od release. No offer to bring the car back in to address my concerns. No sorry for the inconvenience etc, if you are going to charge 2X prices you should also provide 2X service.< /Text>

<Review>This place is close to my home which is great. The service advisor Tim Chen is always very nice and Professional. Place is always clean. Open from 7 to 7 is also very convenient for me.
Only one thing I don’t like is every time I have wait very long time to pick up my car even the car was ready hours ago. Yesterday I went to pick up my car again. Waited for 30 minuets and still no sign of my car is pulling out. So I went to cashier and complained about it. The lady told me many people ahead of me. But when I arrived the dealer and only saw one person was waiting and I saw at least 3 people came after me and got their car already. I do hope they can improve this.<//Review><userid>115526215602415094994< /userid>< pics>

Service department in deleaeship is legit - great setup. Make an appointment ahead of time to make sure you are waiting unnecessary - it gets super packed so make sure you are ready to wait. Waiting area is setup good - coffee, water, baked good. Overall good service and cool people.</review>

Everyone involved with the sale took good care of me and I left with a positive feeling. I will be back here again in the future and will ask Josh to help me...

Took my Countryman in for regular services.  Larry Rusk was my service advisor and he was amazing!  I had asked about services that I thought I needed, but he was there to truly advise me what's best for my MINI.  He was a great help, had me in a loaner and on my way in no time at all.  Pick up was the same- he was prompt, courteous and my Countryman was ready to hit the road for more fun.  Thanks, Larry!  You're the best.  We'll see you after another 8000 fun filled miles!< /Text>

I brought my 528i into the service department and my advisor Marie Fakas did a great job with my vehicle. She went above and beyond what I expected. I came in for a oil change and an estimate on a small fender bender and left very happy with repairs and service experience.  I'm bringing my car back for front brake service soon and I'll be using this location for all my future maintenance.</Text>

I usually really like the service there but this time I wasn’t really happy about it.

I have a crack on my windshield and I know it needs to be replaced but for the past 2 weeks I’ve been careful with it, and it have not gotten bigger AT ALL! And yesterday when I get back my car the crack is at least 3 inches bigger.
Now I understand that it has to be replaced and there is nothing I can do about it but I would appreciate it if they could be careful about it! I believe it got bigger when they clean the car! I always do appreciate when they clean the car yes, but when you see a crack can’t you be careful? They told me don’t be surprised if tomorrow it’s event bigger but it’s not! So I know they just weren’t careful ! I am a bit disappointed, and concerned about how they handle my car...</Text>

<Review>My Mini was recalled to replace a passenger airbag sensor.  I was able to make an appointment and everything just went without a hitch. The people at Mini of Monrovia were very friendly and provided good service. Using their shuttle service, I was able to visit with a friend while they worked on my car.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Everything was great, except that the car I bought didn't have a spare key, which we only noticed after paying the check. Would be nice if the delear inform about that upfront.<//Text>

The service department is great-I trust them completely. The loaner department that's a different story. Gave me a car with 9 miles (1/8th of a tank) and the red service light on. The manager (MANAGER) told me that the car only had 9 miles because the previous person didn't put gas in as they requested. Was told there's a gas station down the street.

Took about 45 minutes to get that car. Long process and then I had to come back.

Just saying if the manager completely negates his role and blames it on the previous customer what purpose does he serve?< /Text>

This service department is fantastic. I was greeted by Robert the minute I pulled up, appointment all set. When the car was done, I received a call and when I arrived my car was clean and ready for me to take home.
I love my MINI and love the way this place takes care of me. This is my third MINI from MINI OF MONROVIA!  See you guys when my lease is up.<//review>

<review>I came in with no notice at 9am when they opened this past Tuesday. I was recently involved in a serious car wreck and literally have been suffering from the loss of my old Mini Cooper to my personal injury damages, missed work and pain. I wanted to cry coming in, because I had only just bought my used 2012 Mini (my very first) a short 6 months prior at a random Honda dealer by my house. Wasn’t a fan at first, but fell in love quickly because I felt safe in it. The day I came, I was greeted by Abby and I was so amazed at how helpful and knowledgeable she was. She took me on a few test drives, gave me her full attention for hours, I don’t even think she took a lunch break! She made me feel better without even knowing it, and a few hours later (and 3 trips back to Monrovia from LA for me) I made the decision to lease the manager special you had out front - and it just so happened to be the same color countryman I had before my accident. Instead of 2012, it was 2019. I wanted to cry I was so happy. Yohanna was a miracle manager, he was on the phone all day and was so polite and warm and I can most definitely assure you I would have not bought this car if it weren’t for the PEOPLE you have working there. Robert in Finance stayed til 10pm to sign the papers with me. I’ve had a hell of a month, driving an awful rental while my car was being looked at for damages, and I am so thankful to say I purchased from you, even though I had no idea where Monrovia even was— but from a simple google search I was led to your location, and I would never buy from anyone else again now that I met these wonderful people. The car is great, but the people you have there ARE WORTH MORE. priceless really. Abby, Yohanna and Robert are the most amazing hard working team I’ve ever met in the car industry! Please let them know! I truly wish everyone had the 360 degree turn around experience I had, Walked in crying in the morning, walked out a new car owner, in happy tears. Everyone deserves their level of professionalism and hard work and commitment to sales, finance and management. Thank you so very much MINI of Monrovia!</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2d909325926bd:0x82e7b2e529d9a10</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I totally would recommend this dealer! The service was fast, easy and very amigable!
The sales person (Tomas Cervantes) knew exactly what we needed and found us the vehicle in no time. The sales price was excellent and we did not have to give a down payment thanks to my sales representative.< /Review>

I couldn't wait to get into my new Mini. Those little cars are so cute and they're made by BMW - must be of good quality, or so I thought.
All the cars come with leather interiors and then there's the option for those sharp looking black enamel spoke wheels.  I ended up getting the Clubman model - it's more spacious than the Cooper and the ride is smoother.  I was happy with my little car ... for about 4 1/2 months, when it needed a brake pad replacement and, as it turned out, a front wheel alignment as well.
Not quite 6 months later, the brake pads needed replacement for the second time .... this is what I have to look forward to ??  I'm so regretful that I didn't go back to Honda - never had problems with those cars.
Honestly, in all my years of driving any make, style, used or new car,  I never had to have the brake pads replaced even once in less than a year.
When I questioned the service manager about the brake pads needing replacement so soon and so frequently, the answer I got was,
"Well, they're a sportier car so the brake pads tend to be a little softer."
Ok ... whatever.
I was also asked:
"Do you drive in a lot of stop and go traffic ?"
Really ??  (this is Los Angeles) Nah, not much.
I'm sorry but brake pads are absolutely essential for the safety of the driver, the passengers and, everyone else on the road.  How does a big name car manufacturer skimp on something as vital as brake pads and be okay with it ??
But if you're really bent on investing in one of those cute little Minis - PLEASE ! buy the extended warranty ... you're gonna need it !< /text>

Came to buy a BMW for a present. Arrived and within the first few minutes a gentleman named, "Charlie Lu" came up to ask if I needed help, and not in a manner like other car salesman, he was very approachable, and knowledgeable. Went above and beyond helping me, even when I lost me keys he drove me to help me find it. Best customer service ever.  I know there are car salesman that tell you to give them a good rating after you purchase a car, but he never even mentioned it. All excellent customer service.  Thanks again Charlie for everything! I will be coming back to purchase again because of him!</review>< Pictures>

<Text>I would have to say, that overall, it was a fantastic experience.  No one can say that they love to bring their car in for service, but they made it super easy. The only somewhat disappointing thing I would say is that they didn't have a loaner car, but, they did give me a ride home.  What I thought was really awesome was that I kept getting text updates during the process of my car being repaired, and after everything was done, I was able to pay for my service ,online, prior to picking up the car.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Tony, our salesman, was very knowledgeable and very courteous throughout  the whole process.
Their entire team made us feel comfortable and we left feeling we got the car we wanted (X5) at a good deal.

I needed a side mirror cover.  I was quoted $72 over the phone by George.  I arrived 35 minutes later to pick it up.  The price was now $90 and the parts guy claimed there was no George there.  Kinda funny since the cashier knew George.  It will be Nick Alexander Mini from now on.<//review>

I always have a great experience at Mini of Monrovia. Whether it is buying a new or used car or getting my car serviced.
Sales employees are very professional, knowledgeable and a pleasure to do business with. The service department is always courteous and caring. They care about what is best for my car and they value my time.< /Review>

Robert provided me with excellent customer service as usual.  He is friendly, considerate, and takes the time to ensure that all of my questions and concerns are addressed.  He does not talk down to me because I am a female (which I have experienced elsewhere before) and I really appreciate that.  On this occasion, my vehicle was done early.  Robert was there to greet me and send me on my merry way.  Needless to say, I highly recommend MINI of Monrovia's service department!< /Text>

<text>I was really impressed with MINI of Monrovia. Despite being understaffed, they were able to get my car checked-in and get me in a loaner vehicle in under 40 minutes. I have had less than stellar experiences here in years past, but am so grateful they have made the necessary changes to make customer service a priority. Worked with Jason who was very communicative and informative. Grateful for the text updates and that I could approve services via text while at work. Will definitely return and ask for Jason again!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><UserId.>110314798399979359891< /UserId.><Time>1524151267167< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Bad customer service.  Bought a car from Charles Nchinda.  When we got home, noticed a small dent on front hood and emailed Charles several times regarding the dent as well as some other general questions regarding the car, not a single response after 2 weeks.  Emailed again, still no response.   Was still in the market for an i3 so we went ahead and bought one from Ontario BMW.  Much better service there (and better prices too).<//Text>

The good:  I got the car I wanted and the financing worked out for me

The not so good:  I was irritated with my salesperson Leo on a number of occasions, primarily when I told him that I still owed on the car I was trading in, his response was "What?!" That was extremely rude and uncalled for.  Then, he told me he was going to have my car charging (i3) while I waited almost THREE hours to sign financing paperwork.  And of course for whatever reason the car was still not fully charged.  I would not rate his customer service skills highly at all.<//Text>

Great experience. Everyone was so nice and willing to help. Rocky helped me find the right Mini for me. Another expert came out to show me all the features on my new car, and the finance guy walked me thru the paperwork. It was quite busy that Saturday night and the got me out without rushing me through the process. This is now my Mini dealer for service and new sales.<//review>

I called 45 minutes before pick up,  and my car was presented to me sparkling clean inside and out. Kudos to the staff at MINI of Monrovia for always maintaining a friendly and professional service.

Efficient friendly handler who not only addressed the recall I for which I came for, but included another earlier pc-valve recall I was not aware of and included the fix a head gasket oil oil leak they found. All included free. Kept me well informed with care in her voice while I drank free lattes.</review>

Josh Tsiu was amazing, I went there for a specific car they had posted online and I can say that he went above and beyond to make sure we went home with the car I wanted. We had the pleasure of working with Youhanna also and both teamed up to guarantee we’d get the best deal and customer service possible. Driving all the way over there was 100% worth it!
Kudos to both of you for your hard work and great customer service skills, it was very nice to meet you guys.

<Time>1555425048601</Time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>Leon Levy, the Sales Advisor was very knowledgeable about the product and was very eager to assist us in selecting the correct vehicle for our needs.  He was very patient and made sure we were satisfied with the purchase and the knowledge transfer prior to driving off with the vehicle.  We will definitely work with Leon again when the current lease is up on my VW later this year.  I had a somewhat negative/frustrating experience with the Sales Manager (don't recall his name) when attempting to retrieve my credit report.  It was more complicated than when I purchased my home.  In contrast, I had a great experience working with the Finance Manager, Malcolm Dougan.  He was extremely accommodating, very thorough, and was able to match our Credit Union interest rate which led us to stay with BMW financing.   Not only that, but he was able offer us additional protection for our vehicle at a discounted rate.  I highly recommend both Leon and Malcolm.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Appointment scheduling couldn't be easier! Although I think calling might be better if you know you're going to need a loaner because the option wasn't there online (but I got REALLY REALLY lucky when I took my car in early on a Thursday morning). Parkson and Cynthia were great - professional, friendly, and very courteous! Great service!< /Text>

<text>My mother and I had a pleasure working with Tomas for a new BMW!
It was about three years ago where my mother first came here for a surprise for myself where she was helped out by Tomas and Amber!
Three years later.. we came back again to lease a new one on my own!
Tomas not only provides impeccable service but he also respects and treats you as family.
My parents enjoyed him on the first visit and it is why we decided to continue to stick to BMW Monrovia.
We've dealt with countless of dealers through the past from other BMW, Land Rover, Toyota, Honda and so on and so forth but no one treats us with great amount of respect unlike Tomas.
He's always on the go, continually texts, updates you as well as does what he can on his part to make you happy and satisfied.
He really does go above and beyond for his customers!
As many know, kindness is always key to any kind of sales... and my family assures you, Tomas has it all!
He is very passionate about what he does and unlike most people, he genuinely cares for his customers.
To my parents and I, theres nothing more we can ask for!
We will continue to be loyal to the BMW Monrovia and to Tomas!
He will always be like family to us!
His humility and accountability really is everything!
Thank you again BMW Monrovia but thank you Mr. Tomas Cervantes!
We are truly grateful for you!<//text>< UserId.>

<review>I have been raving about the service department! My first contact was with Connie when I scheduled my appointment. She was friendly, courteous and professional. I live in Fresno so I spoke to Jason Rangsipat in advance of my appointment to be sure that the parts needed for the recalls would be available. He was also very professional and courteous. He checked the inventory and reserved the parts that were needed. When I arrived I was greeted immediately and the whole process went smoothly. The driver who took me to my sisters house was wonderful, as well. I wish I could recall his name! Overall, it was the best experience that I have ever had in a service department. I love the ability to pay in advance of pickup. I have the option of going to the dealership in Pleasanton but based on my experience I will return to Monrovia!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I took my mini in for brake pads, while dropping off my car, I was informed that my car had an additional issue that was listed for recall. I automatically assumed this might cause additional finacial issues and the possibility that I would be without means of transportation for a while. Parkman was my service rep and he was fantastic, genuinely polite, professional and ensured that I would not be without a car, not only did fix all issues, but ensured it was repaired very quickly! I was very happy with this visit and the service provided, for this has not been my experience in my past visits. Great job Parkman< /Review>

While I live in Michigan, MINI of Monrovia is without question my favorite car dealership. During the MINI Takes the States rally in 2018, my car was broken into--rear window smashed--in San Francisco. I made it to LA, talked to the service reps at the rally, and MINI of Monrovia stepped up to coordinate a replacement and expedited the process so I could stay on track for the rally. The entire staff was friendly, sympathetic, and professional. In particular, Aaron Burkhard really went out of his way to make sure the repair happened quickly, and that my trip wasn't cut short.<//review>

<Review>Its been some time since I've felt like a valued customer at Mini of Monrovia. Its never fun when dealing with the stress of some major car issues like a failing transmission, but I have to say this last trip in was absolutely the best and the customer service reminded me of why I stay with MINI Cooper Monrovia. Parkson and Keven really took care of me and my Mini,  they kept me updated with cost of service progress/estimated completion time, and no wait for a rental car.  THIS is why i stay with Mini Cooper! Not only an amazing  car but amazing staff!<//Review></record>

The service is friendly and one feels comfortable there.

Extremely accommodating with customer needs. Although I did have a Service appointment, Marie Fakas - service advisor went out of her way to get the car service completed and out the door hours before what it would have otherwise been - allowing me to pick up the car early and free up the rest of my Saturday.

<review>Went to Mini of Monrovia for some scheduled maintenance.  I informed my service coordinator, Jason, of an issue that was separate from the maintenance.  The issue was outside of warranty and the part that needed to be replaced was not sold separately; it was part of a bigger unit.  Jason spoke to the service manager and he approved to replace the defective part at no cost to me.  I offered to pay something, but they comp'd it.  This isn't the first time that they have exceeded my expectations.  Great people who understand great customer service and the big picture.  Highly recommended.<//review>< gmapID>

BMW of Monrovia is a beautiful facility which has a great layout in the service department where you basically drive into the building right up to to service representatives kiosks.
Tim Chen has been my service rep there for 6 years since i bought my 2009 328i. Tim keeps me updated on the vehicle status when I take in service or any warranty/recall work. I would probably go with another dealership or a private mechanic if it weren't for Tim.</review>

Robert provided me with excellent customer service as usual.  He is friendly, considerate, and takes the time to ensure that all of my questions and concerns are addressed.  He does not talk down to me because I am a female (which I have experienced elsewhere before) and I really appreciate that.  On this occasion, my vehicle was done early.  Although I was unable to pick it up until the end of the day, Robert was there to greet me and send me on my merry way.  Needless to say, I highly recommend MINI of Monrovia's service department!< /Text>

I leased my Countryman from Mini of Monrovia 3 years ago and have been incredibly pleased with it. I'm a widow and not great at assessing some of the less obvious maintenance needs so rely on the initiative and conscientiousness of the technician and service advisor. I have not been disappointed. Yesterday the technician, Tim, identified an issue with my steering that I hadn't noticed, but realized it happened from my "meet up" with a high curb some six months ago! This adds value to the service for me and I was pleased. While I was there, I spoke to Brian in Sales about my next lease and was presented with some options from which to make a decision in about 6 months--for another Countryman. It was very helpful and appreciated.<//Review>

<Review>Don't be spontaneous at Mini of Monrovia pick another dealer. I will not be coming back here. As a professional I look for quality and people to stand up to there word. They convinced me to make a deposit to I could order the 4 door I needed and assured me they would take care of my current mini since it was financed through them. No problem since repeat customer. Had to put down a $2k deposit but assured me refundable. I come in today my sales person was promoted so dumped on someone else who knew nothing about anything discussed. Now I have to pay over $4k for them to take my trade in plus money for the car. So upset never would have done this was working to lower my payment with a lease. Just asked for my deposit back on my card they refused and said couldn't run transaction today but I know they can they ran my card on a Sunday!! So illegal. Shop elsewhere says Dr. King< /Review>< pictures>

Very happy with the service THIS TIME. In the past, routine scheduled maintenance has taken in excess of 10 hours and in one instance, my car was never worked on after 12 hours.

This time was different. My service rep was great and promised the car back in about two hours. I was very sceptical and in all honesty figured my car wouldn't be ready for several hours. About two hours later I received a call that my car ready,

If this new trend continues, I'll be a happy and returning customer.<//Review>

Excellent service and nice people. My Mini had 10 different items to go over, review and repair. Everything was done to perfection. You can charge your phone, too, while you wait. They have a choice of coffees and popcorn. Even washed my car. Awesome!!!  Thanks so much!!!</Review>

< Review>
I brought my car in last week for a check-up regarding a rattling noise I heard upon initial acceleration, however, as that concern was undetectable to the service department, I was instead informed of a different problem. It was reported to me that my car was leaking coolant as a result of a broken thermostat that was to manage the engine's internal temperatures. I consented for the repairs and was able to pick up my car a few days later. However, now I find my car to be visibly leaking fluid, and I am guessing that my car is experiencing the same problem that was should have been corrected. I am waiting to hear back from the service department regarding the issue. I know it is a business, however, I pay enough money for my car, not to be given the run around or false promises for the quality of servicing that should be provided upon initial consult.<//Review>

I really like working with my advisor Matt but when it came to picking up my car my car was very dirty you can see the fingerprints where they were working on it they tried washing it but all they did was leave water stains on my mirrors and windows yet you can still see the fingerprints , other than that I would have given it a five-star it's the second time that they return my car dirty< /Text>

I had a great experience (once again) at this shop. I thought my countryman was licking because I saw oil on the ground where my mini was parked. But the shop said my mini was fine after they ran several tests (thanks God for that although I still couldn't figure out where the oil came from).  Cindy was very nice and she arranged a temperory car for me while my car was at service. Overall I am very satisfied with this shop.< /Review>

Took my Mini Clubman in for a routine oil change and other included maintenance.  I was greeted at the car by an associate who immediately took care of the sign in paperwork and promised the car would be completed within 4 hours.  The car was finished in 3 hours and was washed when I picked it up.  Great customer service!</Review>

< Review>
Had my clutch repaired under my extended maintenance plan. Clutch moves like a hot knife through butter now. When i took the car in, they drove the car, agreed that it was not acting normal. Supplied me with a loaner for 3 days. No problem.  Damage came from the previous owner that probably never learned how to truly drive a manual transmission.  My only beef is that its a CPO car when I bought it 5 months ago and it clutch has felt that way since I owned it, and it wasn't till i drove my older brothers new mini that I could tell mine was not performing properly. You would think during the however many point inspection they would be able to detect this issue before selling it as a CPO vehicle. Had I not gotten the extended plan I wonder if they would have covered the cost of the repair. guess we will never find out.   MOTOR ON!</Review>

Greatest experience ever. I bought my car at this dealer and never brought it in for service because I thought it was too far.  Now I really regret it.  I loved their custimer service.  Awesome job.< /Text>

<text>Mini of Morovia's Service Department has definitely improved!  I remember when I purchased my Mini from them in June of 2012.  There was a customer walking around looking for someone in the service department, and someone in sales ended up helping her.  Now that the service department has been renovated, it is very easy to find someone.  There's usually at least one person in the service department.  They told my husband that he might have to pay for the diagnostic test.  We were happy to find out that the thermostat was covered under the California Emissions Warranty, and that we would not have to pay for the diagnostic test.  They even washed the car.  That saves my husband from paying to have the car washed.  THANK YOU MINI OF MONROVIA!!!!!...</text>< user_name>

Although I live in the San Fernando valley, I only come to Mini of Monrovia because they actually treat their costumers with respect. Always happy with their service. A huge thank you to Jason R!<//Text>

We had decided to go for a Mini Cooper hardtop and went to the Monrovia showroom hoping just to have a look and come back later,and we met Brian, who helped us not only go through the different models but also helping us with the pricing and lease options to finally decide to buy one the same day! He was pretty quick and customer focussed and got all the paperwork done smoothly. We got the car ready for pick up the very next day once we were ready with the insurance.

<text>I’ve been to every BMW dealer in the Valley including Glendale and by far this has been my best experience. Ryan Thay in service has been the most helpful and friendly service adivsor I’ve had throughout my 5+ years of BMW service. Ryan helped me get my transmission and motor replaced when there was unknown issues in a matter of 2 weeks! Now my experience with other places has been so bad to a point where I’ve beem denied service and repairs before for unknown reasons. God bless this man🙏<//text>< UserId.>

Always a great service experience.  As always, the labor costs for some of the work is very expensive and you would be better served if you can find a reputable shop to do your maintenance after the initial 2 years.</text>

Slow service and no timely response or updates. Unfriendly staff.

They took a week to replace the tires and two wheels and did not provide a loaner vehicle. After that they sent me an email saying the car is ready for pick up. When I arrived they were refusing to give me my vehicle until the check from the insurance arrived. It was poor communication for them to send me an email and then have me arrive at their dealership to refuse my vehicle for a check that was being sent from one of the top insurance companies in the nation.
I had to pay for the service at the dealership to get my car and have the insurance forward the check to me. They do not value their customers time or satisfaction.<//review>

Never buy a bmw just see all the issues and the dealer nonsense you have to deal with. Had a certified pre owned car and of course something wasn't covered according to the stealer.  Lost a customer for life.< /review>

From the moment I scheduled my car service to when I picked up my car, I received by far the best service compare to another Mini Cooper Dealership in Ontario. I had the pleasure of working with Parkson Yee and he was very helpful, courteous, explained every step of the process, and provided a shuttle transportation for me. I would recommend Mini Cooper Monrovia.< /Text>

Bad scheduling. scheduled service and repair for my vehicle. Told the lady in service department that i needed a loaner car because i had a full day scheduled and was not going to have time to pick up the car. She would not accommodate me even though I told her that was the only day of the week i would be able to take the car in. Not feeling valued customer. Five stars for sales 1 star for scheduling.
Called Mini dealer of Downtown LA and they took care of me :)</Text>

I've been taking my convirtable for service to Mini of Monrovia since I've purchased it. In the past I've taken my mini to a dealer much closer to my house but have gotten diagnostics that I did not need and had I trusted them I would of spend ton of money. The mechanics are very honest at Mini of Monrovia and the advisor works with you to give you the best pricing. In few occasions my advisor has worked with the mini headquarters and eliminated paying a dime for my services.
They are my go to dealership😊< /text>

I purchased a used 2015 Mini Cooper 2 door hardtop and Javier Escalante, Motoring Advisor, helped me to find the Mini I liked. He is a super warm and friendly person. However, I didn't like this place first time when I walked into the store because no one was welcoming me, in fact, i stood up there for about 10min. All of the workers were just ignore, seriously. But, Javier helped me to find my Mini, he is really knowledgeable about everything. Whenever I needed to know something, because it was a used car so I need to be careful about buying a car, he let me know everything I needed. I became a friend with him. So, if you think about buying a Mini, I highly recommend to get your Mini with Javier Escalante.<//Text>

<Review>The first contact at a dealership is either sales or service. I was fortunate to speak with Parkson Yee; Service Department. He made the experience
one of satisfaction and confidence in him and the dealership. In point of fact, everyone I encountered was friendly and efficient.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

My mom and dad, Rene and Ingrid, recently purchased a Mini Cooper for my sister. They greatly appreciated the help they recieved from Roger Bader. "He was very professional and accommodating. His customer service was excellent  and he's truly a wonderful asset to their company. I would definitely do business with him again."</text>

<Review>Used to get my Mini serviced where are purchased the car, but wasn't happy with the service I received from the service department, so I tried Mini of Monrovia. I'm really happy I made the switch as they took the time to talk to me and inform me as to what services were performed and their observations about the car.<//Review>< Pics>

Great service advisor in Cindy Gonzalez.  Repairs and maintenance experience a little iffy otherwise -- loaner took an hour longer than expected to receive despite confirmed appointment, and check engine light returned a three days after tune up.<//Text>

Moutaz really help me buy the car I wanted with all of the features that I needed. He showed me everything option that was in stock and he was very professional and not 1 second he pussed me into anything I did not want . My idea was to get a 2015 BMW X1 msport , but at the end of the day I got a really good deal on a 2018 BMW X1 with the luxury package . My wife and I are really happy that we found Moutaz at the Monrovia bmw dealer(sonic). The best part that Moutaz offered me was the warranty packages and maintaince plans they offer . I really enjoy my hassle free purchase with Moutaz. I would highly recommend him if your looking to purchase a car here !!</Review>

<gmap_id>0x80c2d909325926bd:0x82e7b2e529d9a10<//gmap_id><Review>Got a new car but it was dented.

I just want to share my story because we need to be careful when we buy a new car.

It was 3rd times mini, and 2nd times from Monrovia mini. I like mini and this place but not sure from now.
I found the dent after a month later from the purchasing. Actually, my neighbor found it and he said he found a dent 2~3 days later from the new car came.

I tried to looking for all the photos but there were nothing for the car.
But I google the vin number and I found the car listing photos.
And I found the photo with dented part!

I was so embarrassed. I thought it was made by accident but it was from the dealer.

Next day, I stop by the dealer with that photo.
First, I ask them to show me anything about that but there were nothing.
Record, photo, video anything.
Sales people, manager, general manager came to me and they said it is impossible.

I ask them to check the original photo,  maybe the photographer has it.

And from there, they found the photo with the dent and they fix the car.

It was hard time.
I spend my whole weekend (with all my family),  drive 2 time go and back, around 50 minutes foe each, trying to search the photo and looking for the specialist who can fix my car for another day, stressful night for a week.

Last weekend, repairman was came to my house.
He spent 4~5 hours to fix that part.
It looks clear now but we know it was dented before.

When the time for buying a new car, we need to check the car inch by inch before leaving the dealer.

Thank you for reading.<//Review>< resp>

Completely obnoxious parts desk here.  Needed a mini part with a MINI MSRP of $40, these guys want $78.  Called Mini of Universal City, $44.  Take your business elsewhere, Mini of Monrovia is just out to rip you off.

Also, if you try to make a warranty service appointment with them, they refuse to reserve a loaner car for you, they'll only give you a loaner "if we still have one available when you drop your car off."< /Review>

<Text>Unfortunately the AC went out after 5 days of owning the car. The no assurance policy and lack of 30 day warranty is a big issue and made the car even more expensive. It doesn't matter that the car was purchased at a car dealer. Next time will buy a certified from Honda dealer--lesson learned.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Sold my car to this dealership and received horrible service. Was lied to repeatedly about receiving my pay off and then was treated like a two year old when discussing what would occur, repeatedly referred to as "hun" when I made sure to tell them they had lied about the steps of selling this car. Terrible experience and do not recommend to anyone looking to sell their car.<//review>< pictures>

I originally purchased my Mini from Carmax. I brought my car in to the Monrovia Mini service center to have my car's software updated within the same week of purchase. Since my first service, my adviser Parkson has been nothing short of AMAZING. He makes sure to update me about upcoming services covered under my warranty and allows me to babble his ears off about possible concerns and things I would like checked. He is always patient and happy to help. He makes me want to continue to purchase Minis so that I can continue to experience great customer service through him. When informing his supervisor Rudy of his performance - Rudy was just as hospitable and friendly! It feels great to not dread bringing your car in to get service. They are quick and their waiting area is always clean and inviting. Thanks Parkson and Rudy!< /text>

Thanks a lot BMW service guys especially Brooke Ranger.

Despite the internet issues (Verizon), they did really good job and demonstrate the customer service for what people go to BMW.< /text>

Absolutely the best experience I have had so far! Larry was my advisor and he made sure that everything I asked for was taken care of and then some. I came in with a list of services to be taken care of as well as some extras that I was curious about pricing for. I was very happy with the quote he gave me to get absolutely everything done, and then he even managed to make the final numbers come out just a bit cheaper than that! On top of it all, one of the services he recommended ended up fixing a problem that nobody else could figure out! Thank you Larry!!! I will definitely be coming back and requesting you as my advisor for the life of my car!<//Text>

My Mini Clubman was way overdue for service. Unfortunately, unlike many newer cars, Mini's don't do a very good job of letting you know when they need service. When I realized I was overdue, I stopped in at Mini of Monrovia, since it's very close to my work. They were awesome!
They got me right in, serviced my vehicle, made arrangements to deal with a couple additional issues on a future visit, and sent me on my way in less than two hours. Everyone was very friendly, knowledgeable, and hospitable.
Since I'm moving to the area, I'm really pleased to know I've got a great dealer nearby whom I can trust to take great care of my Mini!</Text>

<Text>I purchased my mini last week and had an issue with the gas gauge. I contacted Tracy and she connected me with Parkson in the service department,
My drop off was efficient and was given a loaner car with no problems.

Parkson kept me posted on the status of my vehicle and arranged a late pick up with no hassle.

I would recommend mini Monrovia to anyone.
The customer service is number one.<//Text>< GmapID>

I would not be giving this last experience I had a 1 star, but I have given Mini of Monrovia multiple chances to change my mind. My previous visits have been less than satisfactory as I was kept waiting while no service advisor greeted me or asked how they could assist me. i was kept waiting while my vehicle sat finished in the driveway.

This review is for my last visit on 2.3.17. I hate long reviews so I will get to the point:
1. booked a loaner 5 days in advance, as they suggested, but they were all booked out for a week. I wasn't notified till the day before my appointment.
2. my vehicle service was completed at 10a.m. I wasn't able to pick it up until 3:00 p.m....why?
3. I wasn't notified of my vehicles completion until I personally called into to check on its status.
4. when i came in to pick up my vehicle, the paper work for its completion wasn't even ready. They could not find my information.
5. I had to complain to the manager but he was of no help. All he did was make excuses. Didn't compensate me for my lost time or my terrible experience.

I would not go back to this dealership if I had another options. unfortunately, I paid a lot of money for their "extended warranty service plan" and so far all I've received is a few oil changes and wiper blade replacements. And a whole lot of wasted time. I am forced to bring my car to the dealership until this outrageous service plan expires.<//Text>

The service department was friendly and took care of my mini a 2011 R56 mini convertible.

The car had issues like the plastic water pump leaking, thermostat housing error codes, power window and blinker computer failure, all of which were taken care under extended warranty.

these 2007 -2013 r56 minis are problematic hoever the frindly and helpful staff at Mini of Monrovia will do their utmost to help you out.

Many thanks,< /Review>

< review>
seemingly faulty part was a recall until 2011, i have a 2012 mini cooper, the wire caught on fire, they wanted $167. for diagnostics PLUS $935. for faulty cooler pump. i took it else where, they fixed it for $250. REALLY disappointing and sad. i will never trust that dealership again.<//review>

I was looking for a Certified Mini Cooper with my sister the other day. The person who assisted me was friendly and everything seemed ok. Apart from that the cars weren’t what I was expecting. Most of their certified cars are dented or have some sort of damage that isn't easily repaired and would cost more than $500 to fix.

But that’s not all... Today, I received a text message from Javier of Mini Monrovia in Spanish. I never spoke to them in Spanish. I never identified myself as a Spanish speaker. And, I never discussed my personal life or my birth place with them. Yet, today I was racially profiled by Mini of Monrovia. They “assumed” that I speak Spanish.

I do don’t get me wrong. I am proud of being Bilingual.

However, I didn’t gave them my consent to speak to me or to “assume” that I speak Spanish. They just bluntly racially profiled me.

Therefore, I don’t think they should earn anyone’s business. They might treat you with respect in front of you. But behind your back they might racially profile you.

They apologized, but the fact that they did racially profile me is unacceptable!

As for referrence: I am a light skin Puerto Rican. Also, I am currently studying in one of the top universities in the Los Angeles area, USC without financial aid.

They just "assumed" that I spoke Spanish. Today, you cannot "assume" for the pleasure of gaining a negotation that as of today they won't earn. Also, my friends already know and they are disgusted by the dealership's assumption. One of them is actually a current customer of Mini of Monrovia.... FYI His dad won't be buying any cars from them again, and he told his colleagues who are also customers of the dealership. They know me personally. FYI They won't buy any cars from them again.

It's so unfortunate that Mini of Monrovia has to "assume" when trying to earn someone's business. They surely don't know how to treat a customer.</text>

< Review>
The worst maintenance service I ever have. I dropped off my MINI 2016 for oil change on Jan 20th. Waited there about a whole morning on Friday and turned out they tell me: one of their technicians hit my rear bumper!! My service supervisor, Cindy, didn't let me know the reason why they hit my car, and even an apology!!!
I was like, seriously?! Even myself didn't ever make a tiny crash on my car and one of your technicians hit it and no apologies?? So ridiculous!

Then of course, they said they gonna fix that for me and rent me a car for free during the period. So I came in on the next Saturday Jan28 to get it fix. They said it would take about 2-3 days to reprint my car and my car would be ready for sure before the next Saturday Feb04.
However, I called them twice for my car status and they finally told me my car is ready when I contacted them on Feb08, 10days after I dropped off my car!!! And again, I talked to Cindy again and she said I could pick up my car either Thursday or Friday. Since I'm working at downtown and off at 6pm, I told them I couldn't arrive before 7pm and she told me that's ok and she would get everything ready when I was there even she's not working on Thursday...

And here is Thursday February 09, I got there on 7:10, service department already closed. Since Cindy was off and one of the other supervisor took care of me, said they don't have my key and didn't even know I'm coming!!!! My key was locked in back and no one except the manager has the key!!!
I was like: are you freaking kidding me????
Then why you told me my car is ready??? Why you told me I could pick up whenever I like??
I just looking at my own car in front of me and DON'T have the key!!!!! Do you have that silly thing ever????

Well, then the other service supervisor( jorsh? or George?) asked me to come back tomorrow so he would drop my car in front to the sales department. Really?! Drive from downtown to Monrovia again??? On Friday night??! "Great idea "!!!!

Well, it's 20:30 on February 09, and I wish I could get my car back tomorrow!
And I wish I could rate it 0 star for your service!!!</Review>

< review>
This is the worst service experience I have had out of 4 or 5 MINI dealerships I have taken my MINI to for servicing. My contact was Anthony and I was given a loaner car, as requested.
1. Checking in went fine. Driving my car right up to the service door was odd because the parking lot was cramped. I squeezed my MINI through the cars no problem, but a larger vehicle definitely would not have made it through.
2. They charged a $500 diagnosing fee right off the bat.
3. After checking in, I waited almost an hour for the loaner car. That has never happened at other dealerships.
4. After getting home, which is a 45 minute drive, I called to have my husband added as a driver to the loaner car. The first answer I got was that we had to come back in to let them photo copy his driver's license. Sending it over email was not an option. I called the car loan person directly to confirm this and left a detailed message, asking her to call back. In the meantime, we made the 45 minute drive, rushing to make it before their closing time. When we get there, the car loan person was sitting right at her desk. Apparently, as long as my husband is on the same insurance, we were fine. We did not have to provide them with his driver's license. Well, thanks for not calling me back to let me know.
5. I provided Anthony with a quote from Firestone for suggested repairs. The prices he gave me the next day were considerably pricier than the Firestone quotes, which I suppose is a given since this is a MINI dealership. They did not even attempt to match Firestone's quote.
6. There is a class action lawsuit regarding known defects in the transmission. Basically they sold the cars knowing the transmission was faulty. But the dealership would only replace my "internal failure" transmission if I paid almost $11k. My car is not even worth that anymore.
7. We are now in the market for a new car which will NOT be a MINI or BMW.< /review>

NEVER TAKE YOUR CAR TO GET SERVICED HERE!! I don't ever write reviews but this is something i definitely need to review about. I made an appt to get my cousin's car diagnosed and they told me the fee is 160$ to figure out why the check engine light is on. Waited 2hrs and they sent me home, later that afternoon they texted me saying they need an additional $500 to proceed with the diagnostic. If i didn't agree to proceed then I still owe the $160 for ABSOLUTELY nothing. (since I won't know why the check engine light is on.) The service manager Rudy said it was a practice for all Mini dealerships. They then quoted me $10,500 for the repairs which is nearly half a brand new Mini. LOL!!!! Anyways, after complaining they knocked it down to $432.00  They said that they need to pay the technicians, they all on hrly rate anyways.</review>

Took my MiNi in for a simple oil change and I'm completely sartisfied. They also rain a diagnostic and it came up with some recommendations but was not pressured into getting them done. I really appreciate Patrick Kennedys professionalism at service, and will be back to get some of the other things done when My budget will allow it.< /review>

Recommended to me by my dad since he had such a good experience as well, both of the times he got his car here.

We came at about 8:45 PM and they close at 9:00 PM. But my dad remembered George, one of the top rated salesman in the nation. And when he called George late at night around 7:30 PM, George was absolutely ready to help us get a new car.

George's friendliness and courtesy is beyond exceptional. He really cares about his customers. It isn't just about money or selling cars. He makes you want to recommend everyone else you know to this dealership to be helped by him.

By the time we got there around 8:45, there was only about 4 people left on the site since most people had gone home.

I test drove my potential 2014 MINI that George had ready for me, as we had told him what I wanted over the phone before we came, I went up stairs to sign papers, and unpacked some things from my old car into the new car and then we were out in only 20 mins after I unpacked. I headed home around 11:00.

George made the experience welcoming and extremely quick, given my experience going to previous dealers with my parents when I was young and it took the whole day back then practically.

My experience was such a contrast to what I was used to and maybe what others are used to as well.

Overall: Anyone looking for a MINI Cooper or BMW need not worry about this place if they're hesitant, your experience will be great.

And if I haven't recommended him enough yet (lol): George is your goto man for being helped with your new car.

Neil, his assistant, is also very kind and helpful. You'll appreciate his assistance!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Name>Cathy Dickey< /Name><time>1511547234813<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>Mini of Monrovia was a great experience all around. Starting with our Salesman Javier. He was very knowledgeable on all the minis and bmws. He took us on 4 or 5 test drives till he and my husband found me my Perfect Mini! Javier was very knowledgeable, kind and patient. He walked us through from start to finish. He feels like part of the fam now lol.
Then there was Taja. He was our Mini specialist who comes to walk you around the car and teaches you everything there is to know about our New 2018 4 door mini hardtop. He did a great job. I feel like I know all there is to know now about my new Mini. This car rocks!  We found out very quickly that Taja loved babies too. He was so sweet with our 16 month old daughter Gracie Anne. She loved him by the end of the day!  He even brought her a brand new teddy bear, from the Bmw side!!! So nice!
Also, thank you Yahia! Minis Manager. He was great as well. He was very accommodating.
Thank you Joe! Finance Guy! He was very personable and not too pressing. He helped us choose what options were truely needed at signing.
If you need tinting or stripe work done on your mini, ask for Rolando there :)
“Thank you Mini of Monrovia”

5 stars all day!

They made the whole car-buying experience SO easy. I hate the hassle and the hard balling and negotiation. Yahia and Jenny gave it to me straight and were so informative. I told them what I was looking for from car to budget, and they were able to make it work for me. They didn't have the color I wanted on the Monrovia lot, and Jenny went all the way down to Escondido to pick it up. They were really responsive on email and text. I still talk to them now and feel comfortable asking them questions.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Awful, awful, awful. If there was a category for no stars I would have used that. The first time I presented my car they sent me away with a check engine light still on although I had pointed this out to one of the workers she said it was an airbag light! go figure. Then  the first  night my car was there they called me and said there was a loaner car but when I returned in the morning for the loaner car no one knew anything about this mysterious message only asked later by another worker, " why didn't you pick up your loaner car we had reserved for you?" to which of course I couldn't even respond I was so irritated, so 3 days later and 3 days of rental car later I'm slapped with a nearly $600 bill although I have an extended warrenty on my car. The manager was supposed to call me at my request.....never heard from him and the person responsible for calling me about my car when it was ready didn't call me, I got sent an e-mail! When I complained they asked if I wanted to speak to a manager, why on earth would I want to do that? all they do is apologise for all their mistakes here but never improve. The car I have is a Countryman and it is five and a half years old. It already has had a new $13,000 engine dropped in it at their expense as last time I brought my car in for servic the engine seized because whatever was not done to my car during the last service resulted in their negligence and a 2 mile walk home at one o'clock in the morning because of my engine overheating. Robert a recently retired service manager and John Slater have left who used to have this place happily and efficiently ticking over but with them gone it's been a nightmare here of epic proportions. I've been asked by people who stop me and ask if I like my car, I urge them to walk on by Mini of Monrovia to another dealership as I wouldn't want that responsibilty or guilt of a recommendation. This place needs some serious overhauling......you can remodel a building but that doesn't make a good business</Text><name>Nuala Haggerty<//name>< date>

Well long story short, my bro and I got a (pre-owned) cooper from there and the people couldn't be cooler! they tried to get us the best deal. that is until the clutch on the car went out about three weeks later; all of a sudden all the people who we dealt with didn't know us. we took into the dealer, they said it was gonna cost us $2,500 out of our pocket to get it fixed even though we've had the car less than a month! after almost four weeks of us calling and calling... and calling and not getting an answer- or a call back for that matter- we were able to come to an agreement the ONE good person there who got us a deal to get the car fixed at an independent shop. the dealer dealer paid $500 and we had to fork out $900 out of our pocket.
they said they pride themselves in having return customers but i must say that next time im just gonna get a Nissan.
this is my third time buying a car and in the words of comic book guy: Worse car experience EVER!<//review>

This is a second visit for the service department at Mini Monrovia.

My newish Clubman had a brake problem and I drove straight there. . My first visit for service at this dealership was awful about three months ago. This time, it was much different. I think the service manager from before is now gone and hopefully so.

Clarkson was by himself the day after a big holiday and he was dealing with a lot of people. Once he got to me, he quickly had the shop foreman drive my car. We went ten feet and it was apparent that my brakes were not working.

Clarkson took the order and I was on my way. Later in the afternoon I tried tracking him down and I got into voicemail hell. This is why this is 4 stars instead of 5. I then had the operator email him and he called about 15 minutes later. I then got a text from him saying that I could pick up the car.

The brakes were replaced and Clarkson was very cordial. I paid nothing and I was on my way.

Thank you Clarkson for the great service. Please get me a way to connect about my car up front next time. The text would be helpful as I leave, not later.</Text>

March 4, 2016

On this time of regular check and repair of my BMW X-3
(at BMW of Monrovia, 1425-1451 South Mountain Ave. Monrovia, CA 91016)

This time of regular check was so far good as on the return drive from the service to my house.

But this time repair was very disappointed.
Reason is that both left and right LED rear tail light housings were replaced and charged $792.75 (including labor charge but not including tax).
When I visited at the service for the regular check and the repair, I told and requested the service person to do regular check and to fix only left rear light which was not turned on.
Then, the service person phoned and explained after they checked my X-3 that left rear LED light bulb itself was not be able to be replaced. Instead, whole assemble of rear LED light housings of not only left but also of right should be replaced.
I didn’t have any choice avoid this expensive and uncomfortable repair charge.

The points which I am very unhappy are ;

(1)	This time problem is definitely part defects (or parts not reliable). Current technology of LED light bulb is very reliable and long life. And These LED light whole housings are the original ones.  Why should I pay for it?
(2)	This LED housing design was not customer oriented. Because, Customers have to replace whole housing of both left and right instead of left LED light bulb it self. Why BMW (as one of the most honorable automobile manufacturer) had designed such customer uncomfortable one?

If you have any explanation of the reason why or any excuse against my points stated above, please send me an e-mail.
Also, if you refund the charge ($792.75), I am very comfortable.  Please let me know.

However, I think they did not turn off the service light, as it remains on when I turn on the car.  The dealership is not convenient for a quick pop in.  Otherwise, just great!</Review>

(Translated by Google) I installed the jcw turning kit, and I want to say that Jason and everyone in the service did an excellent job, they treated me excellently, apart from the fact that the installation lasted less than what was planned. I delivered the Country Man 2018 on Friday and they delivered it to me on Friday. Saturday being that normally it should have been until Monday, the installation cost me half of what they charge me in mini Ontario. I will definitely return to mini monrovia.
Thanks again guys!
Paul
