This water is amazing. The price is great for the quantity and I can taste the benefits. I got such large bottles for a little price. Not only does this taste exactly like water but it really quenches your thirst without having to over drink! 10/10<//Review>

Yes, the water really is black. I was definitely on the fence about it but, let me tell you! It was crisp, refreshing and just plain FRESH tasting. Super hydrating. I live in Florida and I’m extremely active, I loved everything about this. I go the original (no flavor) because I wanted to see what it was like without flavor and honestly if you are a water drinker, you do NOT even need flavored. So good.<//review>

<Text>I recently received a pack of the blk water and I must say it taste way better than I expected! I love to work out and cook so I took advantage of the benefits it provides. The packaging is beautiful so simple but the perfect aesthetic and I felt so rejuvenated after my workouts! I have a friend who uses the drops and I borrowed them to use in my food and I had a boost of energy afterwards. If your on the fence about these products jump off now and try them for yourself, you won’t regret it! :)<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c8a3ed63b78f:0xa3602b10325da3c6</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Love Love absolutely LOVE!  I was skeptical at first because the water is black however it taste just like water.  The mineral fulvic is why the water is black and packs many health benefits. Shipping time is great, website is user friendly.  I highly recommend you give blk water a try.< /Review>

This water is so beneficial for inflammation and general mineral intake! You may not know it but your cells cannot function properly without minerals, and you cannot get any minerals through most foods and this is a good solution for maximum absorption of such vital minerals. This and modern medicine has helped me heal when needed and keep hydrated and active :)<//review>

I ordered their 6 pack 1-liter case and it arrived very quickly! At first I was skeptical of the color, but once you get past that, it’s very refreshing and hydrating! It tastes better than most bottled waters and it doesn’t upset my stomach like a lot of them do! The bottle design is also really cool, and an added bonus.< /text>

You can really taste the difference with BLK water. I am a huge fan of this product because there is a noticeable taste difference between BLK products compared other water companies. The packaging is super cute and I love the uniqueness and quality of this product.<//Text>

I had to admit I was a little skeptical at first, I mean the color alone would make anybody wonder. But the more researched the benefits of fulvic acid it made sense. I purchased my first case and before I knew it I was ordering another one to keep up with family demand.<//review>

This was really refreshing to drink! I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth and refreshing taste. I believe that everyone should have this in their household. I got the 12 pack so I was to share with my family and they loved it. The packaging was really put together nicely too! Overall, I highly recommend this to everyone!< /Review>

This is the best water ever! I was hesitant at first cause of the color but taste just like water! Not only does it keep me hydrated, this is a alkaline based with 8.0+ with a blend of fulvic trace of minerals, and electrolytes which has made my body feel so much better.</Review>

This water is my new favorite water! At first I was a bit suspicious and worried it would taste funny but it didn’t at all. It pretty much tasted just like regular water! I read about all the benefits of this water and they’re all so great. I’m very excited to continue drinking blk. water!<//review>

<text>I LOVE blk. water. I frequently get headaches and my go to solution is grabbing a bottle of blk.  I love the new flavors they have and the drops so I can turn anything into a go to headache cure. The original blk. is so simple and is just water but with all the added benefits! It helped me with my headaches and GI tract issues with the fulvic minerals and electrolytes added to the water. Go get yours now!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I use to buy BLk. From target about 5 years ago and ever since then I couldn’t find it anymore. I was so sad because I would go to every target just to find some and never could. I would search all convenient stores when going on trips  and I FINALLY came across their website! The water is so smooth and fun to drink since it’s not clear. Who doesn’t want to try colored water? I can not tell you how happy I am with this purchase and can’t wait to try their flavored water and bamboo water! Purchase this, you won’t regret it!</Review><Name>Payton Keller</Name>< resp>

It’s like it taste just like water but better lol. I like how crisp and smooth it is and they best part they have flavor ones and those are healthy for you too. I love BLK water. If this water wasn’t only sold in a bottle, like if I could drink it out of a Faucet, this would be my go to water drink.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2c8a3ed63b78f:0xa3602b10325da3c6< /GmapID><Rating>5</Rating><user_id>105133813272488178905<//user_id><resp>None</resp></record>

I have so many great things to say about blk. water since learning about its amazing benefits. I have had issues for years with my gut health and vitamin absorption. I was lucky enough to have been at an event a year ago where I was introduced to blk.water.

Not only did I see a change in my energy level but in my overall heath. Thanks their posts I now incorporated blk. drops into my meals.

I recommend blk.water to everyone .< /Review>

<Review>This water is amazing. The price is great for the quantity and I can taste the benefits. I got such large bottles for a little price. Not only does this taste exactly like water but it really quenches your thirst without having to over drink! 10/10</Review></record>

Great water that I can feel my body actually absorb! The original has no taste which is a mind twist because it is black & sort of looks like flat soda. Highly recommend if you’re needing extra minerals & nutrients in your daily diet!<//text>

Yes, the water really is black. I was definitely on the fence about it but, let me tell you! It was crisp, refreshing and just plain FRESH tasting. Super hydrating. I live in Florida and I’m extremely active, I loved everything about this. I go the original (no flavor) because I wanted to see what it was like without flavor and honestly if you are a water drinker, you do NOT even need flavored. So good.<//text>

<review>I recently received a pack of the blk water and I must say it taste way better than I expected! I love to work out and cook so I took advantage of the benefits it provides. The packaging is beautiful so simple but the perfect aesthetic and I felt so rejuvenated after my workouts! I have a friend who uses the drops and I borrowed them to use in my food and I had a boost of energy afterwards. If your on the fence about these products jump off now and try them for yourself, you won’t regret it! :)</review>< response>

Love Love absolutely LOVE!  I was skeptical at first because the water is black however it taste just like water.  The mineral fulvic is why the water is black and packs many health benefits. Shipping time is great, website is user friendly.  I highly recommend you give blk water a try.< /text>

<text>This water is so beneficial for inflammation and general mineral intake! You may not know it but your cells cannot function properly without minerals, and you cannot get any minerals through most foods and this is a good solution for maximum absorption of such vital minerals. This and modern medicine has helped me heal when needed and keep hydrated and active :)</text></record>

< Review>
I ordered their 6 pack 1-liter case and it arrived very quickly! At first I was skeptical of the color, but once you get past that, it’s very refreshing and hydrating! It tastes better than most bottled waters and it doesn’t upset my stomach like a lot of them do! The bottle design is also really cool, and an added bonus.</Review>

At first I was nervous to try the water because of the color. I was wondering if it would stain my teeth? Would if have a bad after taste ? The answer is NO ... This water is all I drink now it is refreshing and it is healthier for you ... and get this there are multiple flavors. blk water is a must buy and you wont be disappointed. You can use my code BLKBLKSIAH at checkout to get 15% off your entire purchase at blk.! shop.getblk.com/<//review>

I had to admit I was a little skeptical at first, I mean the color alone would make anybody wonder. But the more researched the benefits of fulvic acid it made sense. I purchased my first case and before I knew it I was ordering another one to keep up with family demand.</review>

<text>This was really refreshing to drink! I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth and refreshing taste. I believe that everyone should have this in their household. I got the 12 pack so I was to share with my family and they loved it. The packaging was really put together nicely too! Overall, I highly recommend this to everyone!</text>< pictures>

I love this water! It’s like water, but way better. Not only does it give you added benefits, but the taste is great! I love the modern design the bottles have, and the color as well. Don’t be scared to try this, the taste is amazing :)< /text>

<review>This is the best water ever! I was hesitant at first cause of the color but taste just like water! Not only does it keep me hydrated, this is a alkaline based with 8.0+ with a blend of fulvic trace of minerals, and electrolytes which has made my body feel so much better.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2c8a3ed63b78f:0xa3602b10325da3c6<//gmapID>< user_name>

I didn't believe it until I tried it.  I imagined getting water with a different flavor, but it is as refreshing and healthy as spring water (but better) ... I will continue to buy it for its positive benefits.</Review>

This water is my new favorite water! At first I was a bit suspicious and worried it would taste funny but it didn’t at all. It pretty much tasted just like regular water! I read about all the benefits of this water and they’re all so great. I’m very excited to continue drinking blk. water!<//Text>

I use to buy BLk. From target about 5 years ago and ever since then I couldn’t find it anymore. I was so sad because I would go to every target just to find some and never could. I would search all convenient stores when going on trips  and I FINALLY came across their website! The water is so smooth and fun to drink since it’s not clear. Who doesn’t want to try colored water? I can not tell you how happy I am with this purchase and can’t wait to try their flavored water and bamboo water! Purchase this, you won’t regret it!<//review>

I drink a lot of water.  It is awesome that blk. water is working for me.  It is awesome that drinking blk. helps boost immunity and digestion along with so many other health benefits.  Getting minerals and removing some toxins. My husband thinks its great too!  We drink the flavored and unflavored-- both so good.</Text>

I have so many great things to say about blk. water since learning about its amazing benefits. I have had issues for years with my gut health and vitamin absorption. I was lucky enough to have been at an event a year ago where I was introduced to blk.water.

Not only did I see a change in my energy level but in my overall heath. Thanks their posts I now incorporated blk. drops into my meals.

I recommend blk.water to everyone .</review>

<text>Absolutely love this water. Tastes wonderful whether you get the flavored or original. I like it for when I'm working out because it has all the minerals and electrolytes I need without the sugar like other drinks.< /text>< Pictures>

I have been drinking BLK water since it basically came out. I love how I feel after drinking it. I recently just found out that they had 1L bottles. I truly love this water!< /Review>

I recently had my gallbladder removed and my digestive system hasn’t been the same. Blk water has definitely helped my digestive soo much more then I even could’ve thought... and I won’t even go into how helpful the drop have been when alcohol is in place lol I would highly reccomend this product to anyone< /review>< Rate>

LOVED it!!!! The food was AWESOME(a constant conveyor of DELICIOUSNESS), the service OUTSTANDING(ZERO complaints!), & a very cozy atmosphere, with great prices! We'd lucked out, & the other few tables had canceled(awful for this place, but great for us!), so our party was straight up VIP: entire place to ourselves! HIGHLY recommended it!!!<//Text>

I just ate at this restaurant and WOW. Where do I start,

1. My friends husband just passed away and she decided to host the reception at this restaurant. The owner charged her for 50 people when only 43 people were there. He wouldn't give her a number before the dinner he said I will give you a quote at the end and then decided to over charge her. A woman who just lost her Husband. Absolutely horrible.

2. I saw a waitress in the bathroom as I was walking in and she went straight from the toilet out of the door. Skipped the whole wash your hands thing. Seriously? Disgusting.

3. They were rushing us out of there. They served dessert 2 minutes after they brought the main course.

I have never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant before. Can't believe places like this stay open.</Review>

Absolutely horrible service. The owner yelled at my son for accidentally dropping his toy on the floor. I have never seen such cruel behavior by a business owner.<//Review>

Barin rocks. It's so good I'd trade my kids for a year supply of blinchiki. The potatoes are to die for and I literally died when I had the kebab. You're a total queer if you don't go here, my guy. On god, it's great. Grab your fidget spinners and Russian Standard Vodka and head over here for the meal of your lifetime< /Review>

<Review>Awesome tasty Russian food and Live Entertainment. Great for big or small parties as they have 2 rooms. Also, if you forgot to buy a cake - no worries - there is a Russian store Bazar next to Barin where you can get cake and pastries for your party (Note: In Bazar, the Russian ladies behind the counter treat you like they are doing you a favor). In Barin, however, you will be treated very good by all the staff. We have been there celebrating birthdays and dining out on occasion and never had a problem with food quality or service, which is always great.</Review>< pics>

Great place, wonderful food, and very friendly personnel. Prices are good, too. Almost feel bad for taking one star off, but pil'meni (russian dumplings) were terrible, and music way too loud, atleast for a lunch party.

Otherwise, one of the best Russian restaurants in LA and I'd love to come back for some other occasion.<//Review>

Authentic home made cuisine in a family style setting.  Delcious, exotic and endless is one way to descibe the food. The live music makes you want to dance so don't worry about the calories from the spectacular dishes. My favorite are garlic potatos, xrepes with red caviar and the lamb with  rice, just melts in my mouth.</review>

<response>None< /response><Review>One of the best art supplies stores I've been to. Cozy and intimate, but has everything you want and everyone is super friendly and knowledgable. Prices are fair and the products are high quality - it's hard not to go in and walk out with something you didn't come there for just to try out something new. I'd choose to shop here over any big name arts & crafts chain in a heartbeat.< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2960974690fdf:0x33d9c68063a05b57<//GmapID><time>1622571767741< /time>< Rate>

They were extremely knowledgeable & gave me helpful advice. I was in a rush so didn't have a chance to peruse but from the short time I was there, it seemed like they have everything you may need for your arts.<//review><resp>None</resp>< name>

They have paintings and pictures for sale and so many art supplies on every shelf low and high. Aly (I hope I'm spelling your name right) gives top notch customer service with a splash of SFV charm and care. Definitely worth the parking adventure you might endure and savings you'll accumulate over other places. C.S. is where the art magic happens!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Its an amazing little store that has everything you need. It has every kind of materials from a variety of producers, from high quality fancy materials to cheap ones for the starving artists. Canvases, brushes, paints, pens, very cool stuff, you name it. They also do tons of discounts. Don't be surprised if they have a $60 canvas half off plus a student discount. The people are also very helpful and lovely. It truly feels like the owners care about art, the customer, and the store... it makes you feel like a small family. Support small businesses like this one if you can. They manage COVID very well too.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2960974690fdf:0x33d9c68063a05b57< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Carter Sexton is practically a historical monument of the San Fernando Valley at this point. They are one of the few small businesses still around from an era when the area was known for it’s arts, music and crafts. Their prices are great. Support small businesses!<//review>

I emailed them the list of what I needed before going and they got back to me in 10min letting me know.

I've been coming here for over 20 years.  The Professional Discount they offer, really helps out a great deal when you're a struggling artist, and your supply's are pricey no matter what.
Nicky, the manager, and her entire team, are quite knowledgeable about the products they have, and if there's something you're looking for, but haven't found elsewhere.....ask if they'll order it.
Seriously, I've out orders in for French Curves they don't carry in regular stock, and within a week, they'd arrived at the store.  All Pre-Covid of course, but I doubt that that'd hinder you much from ordering anything.
And yes, their Prices are quite fair.  Cheaper than others in some instances, but I'll let you discover that for yourself.
Just tell Nickie that Billy Crooks sent 'ya.  It won't get you any more discounts.</Review>

<Text>This place is great.  Stopped in today looking for some brushes for my hobbying and the staff w super helpful.  Felt safe going in as they keep the customers limited to six at a time and are good about maintaining the rule.  The brush I was looking for was out of stock but one of the employees showed me several alternatives and even gave me a display bush to try out.

The only downside to this store is that it's a little more expensive than Blicks or Michaels but that small price is worth the kind of service you receive.  In this difficult time or I hope we all come out to support local small businesses like this one.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1592514440912, 'text': "Thank you so much for supporting us, Vachon.

<review>This art store is AMAZING . They have everything. Every type of marker and paint you’ll need as well as all the essentials to go with your project. Prices are kind of high but they will give you a student or teacher discount if you fall under those categories. The artist there is awesomeee and the store always draws my attention when I past by.< /review>< Gmap_id>

4 employees behind counter to busy chit chatting to acknowledge my daughter's and myself presence. My first and last time ever at this art store where I felt my business wasn't important to any employee there. We ended up at Michael's where we were greated at least.<//Text>

<Review>You can find so many art supplies. My daughter and I can be in the store for hours. We all know, art supplies are expensive but there is not price for creativity and imagination. It is worth spending the money on something fulfilling like art supplies.< /Review>< Pics>

Despite the smaller size of this store compared to its completion, Carter Sexton has all the essentials. It also has a staff that actively help you understand their stock of supplies as well as teach you how to use most anything. Just ask. You can also grab a 10% discount for being an artist or educator, no forms to fill out or anything. And while everything I needed was in stock, they did offer to order items for other customers who were looking for specialty items.< /Text>

An oasis in the middle of Oakland! A very interesting way to enjoy some peaceful quiet time, to relax and it feels very therapeutic for the mind and body. Facilities were clean and staff friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed the sample of CBD honey before going in and appreciated they had a hair dryer I could use after! Float on friends~< /text>

<Review>I love Oakland floats. I had a subscription for a while so have a regular attendance now - prefer the tanks but their custom built chamber is cool, too. Staff I always super relaxed and I suggest reading the book on floating in the lobby. Also pay close attention to seal the ear plugs before getting wet at all - and if the water never touches your face it’s easier<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>I wasn't sure what to expect, but the staff always make me feel comfortable and answer my questions. It's clean and well maintained and a very relaxing and enjoyable space to visit.
I recommend the float chambers instead of the tanks because you have a private shower in the room. However, I've sometimes gotten cold in the float chambers and I'm told the tanks tend to stay warmer since they are a smaller enclosed area.</text><Date>1560402269305</Date>< rate>

I had my first float at Oakland Floats the day after I ran my first marathon, and it was an excellent way to help both my body and my mind recover. Oakland Floats is quiet and peaceful, and Hannah answered every question about floating I didn't know I had, telling me tips and tricks to ensure I had a good time--put Vaseline on any small cuts on your fingers; be careful not to get the salt water in your eyes; if you do get salt in your eyes, use this solution; even different float techniques that people use!  I really appreciated her taking the time to give me a thorough understanding of floating. I really feel like it allowed me to have a full experience!

I had a really restful time, and really enjoyed the amenities. The earplugs in particular are very impressive and high quality. I got to just think about my running experience and do some creative brainstorming for a while. It was very peaceful and relaxing. I can see how people could fall asleep in here!

My ankles felt so much better coming out than going in, and my skin feels super smooth today! Thanks Oakland Floats! :)</Text>

<Review>Very calming space and amazing experience. The staff create a tranquil vibe, the rooms are clean, the ear bud things were the most effective sound blocking device I've ever used and the infused water after the float tasted amazing. 10/10 stars, an Oakland gem.<//Review>< resp>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>My first floating experience was lovely. I wasn't sure what to expect and I was a little scared of the concept of a float tank but really curious so I went for it and im so happy I did.

The staff was really friendly and the atmosphere feels very private and calm. Upon arrival they offer you tea and water and once its ready, they show you to your room. They ask you to take a shower before your float and then you can descend into the shallow depth of the float tank. From there on you just have to let the water do the work for you. It is so relaxing and healing. You just melt and let everything go. It is the best place to meditate and just plain relax. The water temperature is perfect and there are no distractions.

You will get the best nights sleep after a float here. I plan on making this a regular part of my self care regimen.

Highly recommend.<//review>< Pictures>

Oakland floats is in my opinion the best floating experience that the Bay Area has to offer. The atmosphere is calming and inviting, just the type of space you’d like to be in before taking the voyage inside yourself. Wonderful employees ready to help accommodate you in any way on a moments notice. The rooms and tanks themselves are clean, neat, and orderly. The experience is one you need to have yourself, if you were interested I would recommend it 100 percent. The longer the better, empty stomach, and ready your calm mind. I have successfully learned to start to let go of my constant muscle tension and relax into the moment. Also they have great swag and supplements in the front!!< /Review>

HELLO BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE!! Try floating if you've never done it before and TRY IT HERE!! I am SO PLEASED with my experience. The place was very clean. The service was efficient, very kind and respectful, and they do a very good job at creating a calming atmosphere. They also were very good at easing any concerns I had and were patient with all my questions. And the float experience was INCREDIBLE!! Definitely plan on doing this again. Thank you OAKLAND FLOATS!!</Text>

<Review>This was a great way to try floating without the fear of claustrophobia. It's not a pod that completely seals up but a giant bathtub with a sliding door like a shower. Would definitely recommend.< /Review>< Pictures>

It's definitely worth checking out! Do you like relaxing, calming experiences? Then this is for you! It really helped me clear my head and cleanse. Also, it's right down the street from my favorite bagel shop, so I can see much more of this combo in my future.<//Text>< rating>

I had a wonderful experience at Oakland Floats.  It is hard to describe other than afterward, I felt the most relaxed I have in years.  I slept like a baby every night the entire week - it was unreal.  Try this place.  The facilities are clean, the rooms are pretty quiet, and the atmosphere lends to the experience.  I will certainly be going back.<//Text>

INCREDIBLE! I floated for the first time last week and I can't stop talking about it. After dealing with some life stresses, taking the time to fully relax and decompress what exactly what I needed. I left feeling like I was floating on a cloud. I look forward to my next float! :)<//Text>

Hidden gem. If you care about self-care, Oakland Floats has you covered. I’ve done a float session, light therapy session and Normatec boot recovery session here. It’s a one stop shop for all my recovery and rejuvenation needs. A+ staff and experience!< /Review>

<text>I absolutely love my time here. The facility is clean and the staff is friendly. I am a Massage Therapist and have also recommended many of my clients to Oakland Floats for stress management. It's so important for us to take the time to get out of our heads and just relax without any distractions, and in the technology world we're living in, that can be hard to do. Oakland Floats is a great place to escape and let yourself have the peace and quiet that we all need to keep ourselves on a healthy path of mental health.<//text>< pictures>

She knew great places to eat at after words which was great.

I like the chamber it has a lot more space than the tanks. I drank coffee before my float and could not relax but my legs felt much better and I slept so great<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>A few weeks ago, I was offered an opportunity to experience the wonders of sensory Deprivation at Oakland Floats ! After she serenaded me with tea, a warm shower and my very own suit (all complimentary), she sat me down for an info session! The best part about that: it was short, sweet, and highly informative. Afterward, I floated freely in a salt water solution for about 75 minutes, and allowed any cares or worries within me to fade away! The prices are inexpensive, and geared toward helping any democratic reach zen mode, whenever! I even gifted a maternity float to a friend! Dae, thank you for putting me on to my new meditation space!</Text>< pictures>

The sensory deprivation tanks are a surprisingly helpful way of  shedding the built up tension, anxiety and stress of the day. I was able able to let go of my usual circular thought process and let my mind pay attention to issues that have been put on the back burner for too long. The lobby is very inviting and peaceful. The facilities were very clean and organized. I had the pleasure of being assisted by Deja who carefully explained the whole process and gave me some useful tips for having a successful first float. I will definitely be returning to Float in the near future and let the troubles of the day melt away.<//Review>

My first float was really relaxing. The staff was very helpful and friendly, he did a great job walking me through everything I needed to know and we had a good conversation afterwards. The energy in the space is really nice. The facility was very clean and zen.<//Text>

What a trip!  I can't wait until my next float, I am so glad my friend recommending this place.  I don't want to spoil the ending but my suggestion is, if you have ever wanted to have a really unique experience, book an appointment here asap.  My mind is silent, the music in my heart stirs.  Thank you!< /Review>

Clean facilities and I feel like a million bucks!  Upon walking in, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who took me through the float process.  I was not sure what to ask and I felt comfortable after the walk through.  The float was quiet and deeply relaxing. Actually, I think I fell asleep!  I woke up feeling refreshed and in a peaceful meditative state.  I was much more focused and task oriented at work.<//text>

<review>It's the only place I've floated, but it's always a good experience. It can be pretty pricey, but they will occasionally have deals like the last Wednesday of the month.

Float tanks are generally seen as tight spaces, but Oakland floats has full shower size float rooms for the claustrophobic.</review>< Pics>

Amazing facility (super clean, market-fair pricing), wonderful staff (both personable and profossional) who you can tell are there to be of service.

But I give it three stars because ownership gives the impression of not only being hands off but non existent in an industry that would benefit from a personal touch. Also, I've been a member for almost a year - which included paying monthly fees, despite the fact I didn't actually use the facility for about 6 months straight, and still got charged on a single occasion for a late cancellation...not a big deal, but again, no personal touch.

I love the service Oakland Floats provides, but don't feel valued as a customer.</Review>
<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1472053586428, 'text': 'Hi Robin, thanks for the feedback. I agree that as a long-standing member we should have waived the late cancel fee. I will ask one of the staff to put a credit on your account. As a small business, the late cancel issue can be troublesome and we are trying to figure out the best way to deal with it. We probably get one late cancel a day, so over the course of a month that really adds up. And then spots go empty that could have been filled by someone else. We will be adjusting our prices soon and one of the things we will be adding is a different late cancel policy for members. Thanks again and I hope we see you soon.

<Review>Scheduled an appointment. My schedule is very tight. Since I didn't reply to my text to confirm. My appt was auto cancelled. I have been receiving services here for years with no issue . I find it unprofessional that my appt can be cancelled without my knowledge and if I no show an appt I am charged for the service. Makes absolutely zero sense.< /Review></record>

I never write reviews, but I was very surprised by the reaction me and my mom received. Five days ago I went with my mom to this place for her to get some fillers. My mom ended up getting some Botox also. I was in the room while they were applying these and I noticed at the moment when the Botox needle went into the side of my mom’s eye there was a small streak of blood inside her eye right at the moment of the injection. My mom and I assumed the person applying it noticed so we chose to ignore it which might have been our mistake to believe they will point out if anything went wrong. By the next day the streak grew into a spot and by the second day it was all over the side of her eye. We decided to call to ask if there was nothing to worry about and if this was something that would just go away. Their response was that it would never happen and had nothing to do with them and it must’ve been for some other reason and not because of a mistake. They even laughed and said for them to be the reason that happened they would’ve had to insert the needle directly inside the eye. We weren’t asking for the money back or anything like that, but their complete denial that they had something to do with it or that it could’ve simply been a mistake which we would’ve understood made us upset. They take pictures before which they haven’t sent us to prove that she had this bleeding before the treatment and not because of it. Day 5 my mom’s eye is completely filled up with blood and we are worried and extremely upset they couldn’t even admit that something might have gone wrong instead of just laughing it off and saying impossible. I would just say if you have another option, do not choose here.< /Text>

i had such a pleasant experience at beauty and body med spa! I had lip fillers done for the first time and because of the beauty and body team, i’ll will be their customer for ever and ever.

They made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire process and ensured optimal results! I can’t wait to go back for my peel!< /Review>

<Review>I had to reschedule an appointment on the same day (emergency’s happen!) and was told I would have to pay $50.00 to reserve an appointment in the future. I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars at this location and had numerous appointments over the years so I definitely could have done without the curtness. I’ve been a very loyal customer for years now so it’s disappointing that I’ll need to find a new location. Please train the front desk staff to be more courteous, especially when they are speaking to repeat customers who are spending good money to be there. Having an emergency that causes a client to reschedule is stressful enough with out getting a “you can’t come back unless you pay $50.00 first” response.  At least I was responsible enough to notify the staff before hand that I can’t make it.<//Review><username>LL</username><resp>{'time': 1573687094729, 'text': "Hi LL,\nWe're sorry you feel that way.

I love Genya!  She is so professional and Precise. Great chair side manner and good results. I feel sue does honest work. Not pushing too much filler or extras. Gives me autonomy and time to consider her recommendations. I’m 46 and have  been to many offices in San Diego Looking for the roght home for Botox and filler and this place is the best hands down. Well at least Ganya!
The front office beauties are friendly and professional. I went today and had my temperature taken and a few questions...asked regarding Covid. Which my personal beliefs is pro mask- “you protect me and I protect you!”
Anyway, if you’re looking for a new home for a little facial renewal join this spa. I give 5 stars!

The registered nurse that attended me was rude and unprofessional.  She came in the room, asked me to remove my pants and to cover my self with a paper sheet.

Take in consideration the procedure was on my legs.  She seemed bothered to my requests and in a bad mood.  She was Asian and I believe her name is Lee or Chin.

The drape is always kept on the client during treatment with only the area of treatment is exposed. Unfortunately  sometimes the drape fall off and has to be readjusted and tuck in so it may seems as if the provider is frustrated with it falling off. It is best to wear clothing that make it easy to access the area such as short, skirt or loose pant which can be pull up and out of the way without having to undress.

All the people at this place are so friendly. I’ve gotten a few treatments here and I have always been satisfied. I do feel if I was ever unsatisfied I could tell them and they would do their best to resolve the problem. The perfect mix of professional yet warm and caring. They also have latise and other high end homecare products.< /Review>

Yes, I would definitely recommend B&B MedLounge, my sibling also highly recommends them and they live in El Cajon!

Professional, attentive and overall, a great staff. They also have a Solana Beach location, though all of my skin care work has been done here in Hillcrest.

Hospitality abounds and the front desk personnel have always been accommodating, even with appointment changes.

I have had two different procedures, both by Carolyn, before and after the procedures the staff have been VERY helpful in prep and recovery.

Clear Pre and Post procedure instructions were given and the staff make themselves available for any questions you may have.

The procedures I had were the
PiXel8-RF micro needling and a peel.
Very reasonably priced and the consultations for both were at no cost, NO PRESSURE.

All of my appointments were provided in a quiet room with no intrusive activity or rushed.

I would provide before and after pics but I'm a bit self conscious though the results are positive and are clearly visible.

Off street parking is available and right near Hwy 163. Plenty of on street parking around the corner.< /Text>

Genya is an Artist !!! She recommended Sculptra for me and I went for it. I now look 10 years younger and get lots of compliments from family and friends. My face looks fuller, my skin looks radiant and healthy. I gave Genya permission to let potentially clients view my before and after pics.....because I want every woman to look their best. Genya is my girl and I appreciate her expertise and knowledge. Heike<//Text>

Been going here for several years to get Botox, Dysport, and IPL. I've never had any problems and have been completely satisfied every time. Yesterday I got tear trough filler. It's perfect and there was zero bruising. They are much less expensive than a plastic surgeon or dermatologist.</review>

<user_name>Pamela Collins< /user_name><rate>5</rate><Review>Absolutely love beauty and body med lounge!!! I have been coming here for years and have referred many of my friends, and this business has earned lifelong customers! They have extremely reasonable prices and amazing staff! I hope one day they will expand and move to an even larger location. I have been going to Genya Liff for years, and she is an absolute perfectionist – exactly what you want! She is incredibly kind, and caring. She cares very much about her clients personal lives and well-being. As long as Genya still works here I will never go anywhere else</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Light and fluffy donuts. Always a nice treat for my staff! I think their prices increased. I used to be able to get 2 dozen for about $20. This time, it was $30! Gotta look for those Groupon deals next time.<//review>< UserId.>

The only set back is the parking lot is limited due to, "too" many stores in one small location.  Not Krispy Kream's fault, buy the Planning Department of Pinole didn't count enough parking spaces for how many stores on in this center.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80857722cc6a3953:0x14d238545ccfe806< /Gmap_id></record>

I don't think they make the donuts here. the ones I got didn't taste fresh and was pretty rock hard. The premium donuts that cost $1.49 more (mint with chocolate filling) looked awful with different shapes; they weren't even round! In fact they look like something from the reject pile.

The selection here is not as good as the one in Brentwood or Concord. But the staff here are really nice and friendly..</review>

<Review>I like KKD's cause they got my favorite donuts. Although sometimes not each visit but it did happen last visit when staff keeps mentioning the savings if I bought two dozens worth. A half dozen is way too much already for me and now the pressure is on???  I politely accepted the savings. I hate myself when I always give in.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Megan went above and beyond today! My boyfriend and I appreciated her patience and her positive attitude. I was a bit apprehensive and indecisive about making decisions... But with the help of Gustavo and Megan - they made some great recommendations and accomodations (she even made a box of donuts for each of us!). I will definitely be back in the future! Keep up the great work and keep smiling.<//Review>< Pics>

Went in at 1:30 and was almost out of everything! Only one apple fritter which tasted stale and a choice of glazed sour cream cake donut and glazed  chocolate sour cream cake. That eas literally all they had . They all tasted awful . I have never walked into a Krispy Kreme and left upset . I am rarely one to review either but this was so bad.<//text>

Pinole too ghetto for Krispy Kreme. This place got rats and failed health codes, that's why it shut down. Employee at other Krispy Kreme said so.<//Text>

<text>I can't believe we just went to the Pinole California store an hour before closing and they didn't have any donuts out. We always pick up a dozen or two on our way home to
Marin county because there is not a crispy creme closer to our house. What a disappointment! We left without purchasing anything. This just isn't right. Really bad service that corporate needs to know about. Better look for a new job whoever is working at that store tonight. You don't deserve a job!<//text></record></dataset><record>

Got a mixed dozen. Original were good, but the chocolate doughnuts were hard like they had been sitting out from the previous day. Way to expensive for what you get.</Text>

I'm currently on a cut and last night I decided "YOLO... cheat day" so I checked out the Krispy Kreme website to preplan the 24 doughnuts
(Hershey's Gold, 4x Chocolate Iced Glazed, Apple Fritter, 5x Original Glazed, Glazed Raspberry Filled, Glazed Blueberry Cake, Strawberry Iced, Glazed Chocolate Cake, Cinnamon Twist, 2x Chocolate Iced Raspberry Filled, 3x Powdered Strawberry Filled, Chocolate Cruller, Powdered Blue Berry Filled and Cinnamon Bun) I was going to binge before driving 10 miles to this location. I arrived sometime around 9:40 pm( they close at 11pm) and THEY RAN OUT OF ALMOST EVERYTHING. I was able to get 1 glazed chocolate cake doughnut, the last apple fritter, and a blueberry cake doughnut. I will eventually revisit and hopefully get to try all the doughnuts off my binge list but until then here are my ratings for the doughnuts I did try.

-Blue Berry [4/10] - very artificial tasting and just meh
-Apple Fritter [6/10] - Great fluffy texture with real apple chunks but it was bitter...
-Glazed Chocolate Cake [6/10] - Thick and cakey. Very chocolatey and sweet. It was decent/acceptable.

Quite the disappointing experience overall. How do you run out of your signature flagship product....the original glaze??!?!?!??!?< /Review>

Today was free doughnut day and it was a great experience. The employees were very nice and the store itself was also pleasurable to behold. Nothing about this place reminded me of the grimy local doughnut businesses I've come to love. I will keep coming here for doughnuts as long as it doesn't close down like the old one did years before.</review>

This location won't give you a free donut when the hot sign is on. Apparently that's only at the factory stores. #lame< /Review>

Subway is Subway.  They have new sandwiches and they change the pricing all the time since the $5 footlong went away.  BUT it is Subway and the sandwiches are something to be depended on.  I do try to take advantage of the flatbread and I love getting the breakfast sandwiches when I can.  Being able to get a Bfast sandwich at night is always a plus, especially on the healthy side.  Worth the drive from my school and back for a hot Breakfast sandwich to get me through a night time college course.< /text>

<Review>Surly and sour employees. Chintzy with the toppings. Rude. Toaster doesn't work. I see they have the exact same review from TWO YEARS AGO. Obviously they just refuse to use the toaster. I guess they are too cheap to run it. Awful.</Review>< user_name>

Worst service out of 3 workers, no one seemed interested in helping me, nor did anyone seem in a positive mood, which doesn't mean you need to bring that negativity to your customers.</Review>

They are very flexible, they make sure you get the proper time and training while you are there, and their PRICE is very reasonable. Plus not to many places are priced like theirs.
Big thanks to Sunrise Trucking School and especially to the instructor Jasminder Singh for the help as I graduated today!  Will be spreading your name for sure!</text>< rating>

<userid>107274283977499532721</userid><Review>Thanks to Sunrise Trucking School I now have my CDL. Both Jose and Jassminder are great instructors. At this school you work at your own pace and you will not go to the DMV until they are sure you are ready to test. Jose is a very good instructor who I really appreciate. He explains things very well and is very patient with the students. I tried Indian food for the first time at this school and can say it’s very delicious. Thank you Sunrise Trucking it was a pleasure. I most definitely recommend this school!100%<//Review><gmapID>0x809466d6554ca5e9:0xd768cf1c1f4c6edb< /gmapID>< Pictures>

Sunrise Truck Driving School is the best school in entire Fresno, CA. The instructor Mr. Jasminder is a great person with outstanding teaching skills. I went all the way from L.A to Fresno to get my CDL due to great reputation of this school. On my 1st day I was nervous and clueless about the truck driving skills, but thanks to Mr. Jasminder who trained me so patiently that I become confident with my truck driving skills, I was able to successfully clear my driving test at the DMV within 3,1/2 weeks. Like it is mentioned in the other review, they will never rush you for behind the wheel test until they make sure you are ready for it.

I will definitely send all my friends and relatives to Sunrise Truck Driving School. Their goal is to get you trained and become an experienced Commercial Driver.< /text>

<Text>This place is a gold mine! I just moved into the neighborhood a month ago and I was looking for a good staple grocery store. Lo and behold the Grocery Outlet on Santa Clara street. The prices are decently affordable, especially when compared to the expensive chains like Safeway or a Trader Joe's.

Another great thing is really helpful staff!

They offer everything from household stuff to some limited decor to food. Easy for a quick drop in for dish soap or cleaning supplies, body stuff or even a fluffy blanket.

Moving onto fresh food: I have a very broad palette too and love to experiment with different foods and this place has a good variety in fruits, veggies, frozen selections, oils and junk. Although it's hard to find more niche stuff like plant spices (thyme, rosemary etc.), I give this place a solid 5/5.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I love grocery outlet if they see there's more than a few people in mind they open another line to help you get out faster they keep the place clean tidy very nice people that work there very helpful I mean that's the only place I go to shop food wise treats candy whatever I like that place I highly recommend it everything is way cheaper than anywhere else I prefer to shop there I get more for my money but the people make it all that much better so it's a good place trust me you'll enjoy it and they don't leave you standing around they see them more than three or four people in line they bust out to open another cash register right away so it's a good place</Text>< pictures>

This is the outlet store and my high rating is based on this. You can buy fruits and vegetables for pretty low prices, also watch the deals - it could be very profitable. Some goods can be available one day and disappear another day. There are people asking for a change outside, just be aware.<//Text>

< Review>
They are awful. I parked my car and later on discovered that it was towed, had to pay 430 for that. They don’t put any CLEAR signs saying that the parking lot is only for their customers. First of all, the parking lot is huge, and that area  has many stores, so it is not obvious. If you go to wholefoods, they put big signs saying parking limited for 2 hours, well this low level grocery store didn’t, which makes me think if someone else is profiting from the towing business. Weird that the manager had the towing phone number memorized, but never cared about putting signs about towing. What a shame. Taking money away from students...<//Review>

< review>
This grocery shop is the best not only for its location but also for its high-quality products as well. The staffs here are very helpful with my needs, and everything was systematic. I really love to have my groceries here because the products or items are complete. I strongly recommend this place for your grocery needs!<//review>

If you want a clean, friendly place to shop, look no further, this grocery shop is all you need.  They have everything you need. From fresh fruits to vegetables, and fresh fish, they've got it all for you. I like how wide their aisle was. It was indeed big and spacious.  The counter staff was was so friendly as well.<//Review>

Price tags differ from the register.   Be carefull not to think you are getting a deal until the register gives a price higher.  This is not legal according to weights and measures.  Is the staff really that lazy?</Text>

I love this place. Being situated in the heart of downtown they have longer hours and, quite often a better selection than their sister sites. Being an outlet products vary continuously so regular visits yield different results. Beer selection is top shelf micro brew.< /review>

<review>It is a mix of discounted groceries and some dollar store type items. There is a bit of everything from wine to cereal to produce. They did have some great deals on organic items that I buy elsewhere.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT0arV4hq9jlW4ymvHlJ08npOG3RSFbemm_JRo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7aIip4XeC-N93DV_IKG3HmfdOMTH1DHRTGY6Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEBQ_qWsM2CVALQsp5W8r7MJk7E_dRd1zqHI29=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

Store is awesome, for families, single student or just anyone! This account has it all. Oh did I mention all the healthy options in their NOSH aisle as well as my favorite the 20z 22grain and seed Oroweat Org bread it's fabulous. Owners Savannah and Nick along with their friendly staff are there for all your needs. Can't wait to get back !</Text>

<Text>Terrible service.. manager is very disrespectful and lies to their customers. Stated that the manager was not their and it so happened that they were the manager. Absolutely ridiculous. If grocery outlet employs decietful managers who disrespect and avoid customers, that should be saying a lot about the quality of their stores.< /Text>< pics>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>Love the produce and range of goods, and neighborly feel of the place and good workers, but there is nothing that harshes my middle class mellow or the shopping vibe like having your carts sieze up at the door. Get RID of those things or get rid of good customers!! UGH!  You are telling us your management imagines all your customers to be thieves.  UGH. from 5 stars to one for that alone.< /Review>< user_name>

<Text>It is always a toss up between good buys and not sure what brands or even what products you may or may not find frkm your grocery list. If you go with a more flexible list, you will do well. The costs tend to offset for me the need to usually still go to a second store for what I may not find here.< /Text>< user_name>

<review>I used to shop at Grocery Outlet a few times a week for the past 5 years. NEVER AGAIN. Other grocery outlet locations always told me to disregard the one hour parking sign and just enjoy shopping, and so why is the parking policy not consistent? This store does not offer restroom so I had to look elsewhere. Am I supposed to drive to look for a bathroom?! The store owner said its a franchise and every store operates independently, but such basic common sense and consistency are not here. It was during a slow hour and empty lot. They towed my car for pure greed after I shopped and went out to look for a bathroom. It cost $400 to get car back and they claim themselves a discount store? BOTCOTT FOREVER.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Great bargain on food is no joke! Most of the time I find all of the food items I am looking for. However, CHECK EXPIRATION Date on all products before you get them (some tend to be expired or near expiration). Thats the reason I am taking a star off<//text>

Excellent deals but check the expiration dates. I also was told that their "Wow" deals received via email are only for the day the email was received??? That was news to me as it said "while supplies last" HMMM. Can't complain when something is so cheap, so yeah, I'll continue to visit every couple of days.< /text>

This place changed from nice to bad. People wise. There was one gal in particular. I went this morning to return a few things I was going to cook for my son because we had to decided to eat out instead and she demanded to know why I was returning my items. Yes I had the receipt. The manager was there and she was polite but the gal at the register was rude. I felt humiliated. Like just because I am older she gets to abuse me. I am going back Monday and talking to the nice manager again. This type of behavior is unacceptable. Now they are under new management. It's improved some.<//text>

This is the worst grocery outlet in the bay area, very rude customer service, and a totally ripoff store owner. You get better price and better selections at other grocery outlets. Also you always see a bunch of homeless beggars outside the store. Also beware that even if you shop at this store they still tow your car sometimes because they contract with a towing company nearby purely for greed, as they tow your car even when their big parking lot is virtually empty if you park over an hour. Totally unreasonable and rip off. Also beware that they sell expired food sometimes, mixed on their shelves. Consumer bureau complaint filed.< /text>

<text>I enjoy shopping at Grocery Outlet. I feel it is more beneficial for consumers that buy in bulk. You can't beat the price for pet food, either. The clerks there are courteous and quick, knowledgeable and accurate in locating items. They also have a large selection of hygiene, makeup, cookware, first aid,and household items.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rating>4</Rating>< gmapID>

A grocery Outlet you always need to be careful. a lot of the products are almost at their shelf limit... I like it because they have merchandise like bath & electronics just variety of things that changes all year long a discount price. But the frozen food is good and cheap and this is blonde cashier that's really cute.,.....< /review>

Good deals for name brand items. The only problem is they rarely have the same deal twice. Buy it while you can or it will not be there the next time you visit.(If this review was helpful, please hit the "like" icon below)< /Review>

<Review>I love this place because every time I go it is a shopping adventure.  The have everything from organic products, a wide assortment of everyday staples and IPA beer. They even have kitchen items. I bought two very nice Pyrex glass containers for $3.99 each. Their stock of items change often. If you see something you like at a good price, stock up because it may  be all gone tomorrow!< /Review></record>

Great store with a large selection of very affordable food. I was truly surprised at the organic selection available! (Fruits, veggies, canned goods, snacks, etc) We appreciate that someone has made eating healthy more affordable. As long as you know produce quality we have done quite well with our picks so far.<//review>

The groceries are fine and service always with a smile. Thanks, Grocery Outlet! My only peeve is their anti bikes inside the store policy. It is in a historically rough neighborhood and so even with a bike lock...</Text>

< Review>
I love the Grocery Outlet for discovering new products. Everything is so inexpensive that you can try so many new things and if it doesn't work out, very little loss.  It's not a place to get something you need all the time as products change daily. Think of it as a little adventure.<//Review>

<userid>107896084799021660933< /userid><text>I have been a customer of this outlet many times. Many times I would park here and eat first and then buy groceries as there are so many neighboring restaurants. And one time I parked my car and they were watching me. They had my car towed because it took me more than one hour. The towing fees was $420 which was hole in the pocket. It would be better off to just park on street where rates are low and parking ticket is $60 but little did I know. It was 7pm winter night and lot was almost empty.

I am never going back to this outlet again. Towing fees extortion is an alternate business for this kind of grocery stores.<//text><Name>Akshay Sharma</Name>< Pics>

I was in a hurry to buy a charger and get through the brutal commute traffic.So I went in there to buy a car charger for my phone and a snack for the road.(never got any snacks! lol )So I got a charger that said it was compatible for my phone. When I got to the cashier, she insured me it would work and that I could bring it back if it didn't. I just needed it to work! After I purchased it I had immediately went to try and use it.  Smh nope didn't work and had to get a refund. Oh well.... cashier was nice but didn't know her stuff.The store had old model chargers. Who does that they are obsolete! Anyway had to go across the street to the Metro store to buy one you can read my review there. Overall this is a grocery store that has miscellaneous stuff. It was clean and maybe next time I would shop for groceries.<//Review>

<Text>It's rare to find a carry basket when I walk in the door.  Unbelievable amount of products on the shelves with NO prices listed.  Trying to get a price check near the back of the store is very difficult.  Sometimes the store employee doesn't speak English or doesn't understand what I am asking for.  I needed $40 cash back, which is generally allowed, but I could only get $20.  Nowhere was the cash back restriction posted.  These comments are for the downtown San Jose store on Santa Clara street.< /Text><gmap_id>0x808fccbdd79785e7:0x77a6a90ca8d9ab38< /gmap_id><name>Gregory Weiss</name>< rating>

<text>This is a pretty decent location, but keep in mind they have a limited food selection. Most of it is bulk food stuffs. Also be sure to check the dates on items you buy; many will be close, or past, the expiration date. Lastly, they have a good beer and wine selection.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>Pros: Great place to get cheap and affordable groceries. Always check the dates on things. The reason things are cheaper is that items usually do not have a very long expiration date.

Cons: The cashout lines are very long because there are usually only two registers open. If you are looking for the same items on a weekly basis do not bother, not everything is stocked consistently. The checking of IDs for alcoholic beverages is questionable. According to what I've seen is that I have been born in many different years on multiple occasions.

All in all it is a decent place close by in the SJ downtown to grab some affordable groceries without having to break the bank.< /text>< pictures>

It has too many fragrances. Products are spoiling or spoiled due to transportation and storage. Products are priced incorrectly. The parking lot smells like urine and garbage. They don't always have everything I went there for causing for more spending in the long run. They don't have enough vegan products. Their water gallons aren't ever refrigerated. They would want to have more cashiers. Their plants are dying every time I walk in creating a poor front display. Their avacodas are usually too hard to eat right away. I brought a Naked almond milk beverage and got sick. I have no choice but to go to this store. Any where else I go the employees are rude and follow me because I wear a mask for allergies and backpack for my belongings. They employees here are really nice and helpful even though sometimes  feel like they're talking about me because I'm homeless. Thanks Grocery Outlet.</Text>

Prices are reasonable although quality is somewhat lacking on some items and selection is not huge. Items carried poo be week may not be there the next. Overall worth a visit.<//review>

Prices are very competitive. They don't carry everything that the major chain stores have, but what they do carry, is at a significant discount. When I go grocery shopping I take my list here first, then I'll get the few remaining items at the more expensive chain stores.< /Text>

The cheapest prices you will find for groceries almost guaranteed!  The protein/supplement section is a hidden gem.  You can get protein powders at almost half the price than what you would find elsewhere.  Granted, it is pretty random on what brands they sell week to week, but if you are not brand picky, then this is fantastic!  The other day I was there, I found Buff Bake protein cookies for 50c/each, which is a complete steal since those cookies normally go for $2.99/each.  And the cookies did not taste stale or old at all!  I normally shop here for non refrigerated/frozen items because I am pretty leery of those types of products here due to the expiration dates.

If are you looking to make your dollar go far, look no further than Grocery Outlet.</Review>

A moderately-sized store of a well organized and reasonably comprehensive inventory, comprising food (with a few pre-mixed salads etal), sundries (matts, storage containers, kitchen items, etal), and health items (vitamins, supplements, non-prescription meds, etal).

Low prices are the real selling point! I don't need to go to the local CostCo anymore for select staples.

Manned (only) checkout counters are always understaffed, but acceptably courteous. On the infrequent necessity to ask for aisle info for a food item, staff are always knowledgeable, but just try to find one at liberty to ask!< /text>

I love this place because you can buy all kinds of organic stuff for cheap, but of course the stock is inconsistent so you can't count on it being there if you come back for it. Also... They can only sell booze from 10-9 so if you come outside those hours you can't buy any. Something about the elementary school across the street. :/</review>

My shopping experiences at the Oroville Grocery Outlet have been great! I'm not just referring to the low prices of so many of their products, but what really enhances this store in Oroville is their friendly service. Many of the employees will even recommend specific products on sale when I am in the store.<//text>

Inventory varies, but in general this is a great spot for reasonably priced dairy, produce, and decent low- and mid-priced wines. The best Grocery Outlet in the area.</Text>

Prices are good as a person can find now days. Of course,  they once in in awhile run low on certain brands, because they are so busy , and keeping the place organization as well as they are kind to you when your shopping, or need help finding things, even fellow customer s are awesome.<//review>

Great prices definitely. But you need to check the expiry date . Most of the time they are close by and that is the reason it would be so cheap .<//Text>

< review>
Get some products way cheaper than Walmart , Costco and Safeway. Though , you will not always find products, and may find some products that aren't worth a buy. This store particularly, is frequently visited by a lot of homeless people, which kind of repels me.</review>

I do not recommend them they call wing crane to tow your car so if you want to buy something in the same parking lot as eating a soup you have to park at the restaurant if this shop does not take a picture of your vehicle and gives it to you if you you spend an hour is stupid because it is the same place to park for all business and you will have to pay 420 dollars really the managers give very bad service</review>

The times i have gone to this store, it is very clean. Although it does lack in variety, you can still find something you need in your kitchen.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) This store sells very cheap I had not discovered it until a friend told me and I went and the truth compared prices and if I realized that I saved too much and that is why I loved going to that store, recommended for now that the holidays are coming to save as much as possible ahitita that money is scarce.

(Original)
Esta tienda vende muy barato No lo había descubierto hasta que me dijo un amigo y fui y la verdad compare precios y si me di cuenta que me ahorre demasiado y por eso me encantó ir a esa tienda, recomendada para ahorita que vienen las fiestas para ahorrar lo más posible ahitita que escasea  el dinero.< /Text>< Name>
