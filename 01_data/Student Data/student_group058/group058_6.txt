Fast-Fix is awesome!! My friend referred me so I came in with a broken necklace, and the owner knew it was a fairly easy fix so he repaired it at no cost in 15 minutes! He was extremely kind, honest and accommodating. I highly recommend Fast-Fix and would give it more than 5 stars if I could.</Text>

<Text>I went in to Fast-Fix Jewelry & Watch repair for a battery replacement for my watch and Fast-Fix Jewelry & watch repair was able to do it right then and there on the spot!  The service literally took about 1 minute!!!
I was very happy with the very fast service.  And with the friendly and courteous repair man and owner.
Very knowledgeable, fast and open later than other places.
I will go back for my future repairs and I highly recommend Fast-Fix Jewelry & Watch repair.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Mark and his team are truly amazing.  I've had lots of work done here over the years, from work on my wife's wedding rings to repairs on our watches and other jewelry as well.  The work is of very high quality, and their prices are lower than that of traditional jewelry stores.  They've earned us as customers for life!< /Review>

Quick and pleasant. Got there right before they closed Thankfully, and although it was only a battery change on a watch, another local jeweler was unable to do it yesterday. They got it done efficiently but withoutaking us feel hurried for coming in so late! I recommend them!

Came in to get a quick repair on my watch ( back popped out) and was very welcoming instant I walked in. Once he was done, I asked him how much and he told me "next time." Willing to help others like that speaks volume of his character.< /review>

Not only did I get step by step directions through the mall, Fast-Fix resized one of my rings, and fixed my pearl ring (the pearl fell off). She asked if I wanted a long or short stem for the pearl. The long stem cost a little more, so I chose the short stem. I was told it would take a couple of days, and I would get a phone call when the rings were ready.  Not only did she go ahead and used the long stem, no extra charge, my rings were done the next day.  Good customer service makes a company successful and brings people back. I now consider myself a customer of Fast-Fix!!</Review>

Sean did a beautiful job with repairing a pearl necklace and sizing a diamond wedding ring. Both are family heirlooms to be passed down to my daughter for her wedding so I greatly appreciated the care he took with them. They both look like new!</Review>

< Review>
Not only did I get step by step directions through the mall, Fast-Fix resized one of my rings, and fixed my pearl ring (the pearl fell off). She asked if I wanted a long or short stem for the pearl. The long stem cost a little more, so I chose the short stem. I was told it would take a couple of days, and I would get a phone call when the rings were ready.  Not only did she go ahead and used the long stem, no extra charge, my rings were done the next day.  Good customer service makes a company successful and brings people back. I now consider myself a customer of Fast-Fix!!<//Review>

Great service. My watch was acting flaky (second hand lurched 4 seconds at a time). They checked the battery, it was under warranty, replaced it, no charge. It doesn't get much better than that.<//review>

<GmapID>0x80c29b74b0f5b55f:0x16664093d574a697< /GmapID><rating>1</rating><text>I can believe how this location in the northridge mall try to swindle me out of my money.  I went to get my 18k white gold bracelet cleaned.  The guy there tells me that if they polish it they will have to dip it in rhodium so it doesn't turn yellow.  He tell me that they dont have the equipment of that size for my bracelet and that it will have to be sent out. Cost will be 170.00 and take 5 days. I take his card and say let me think about it. He tell me places in the mall also don't have the equipment. I leave and just before exiting the mall doors i walk into a jewelry store to get a second opinion.  The lady tells me 30.00 and will be ready in 30mins. I tell her the fastfix store told me she says they are only trying to take your money. I couldn't believe it! 30 mins later my bracelet looks brand new. To the guy at fastfix in the northridge mall Shame on you!</text>< time>

Every time I've tried to get food here they say kitchen is closed, but when I drive by later to get food from somewhere else there place is full of people. Seems like a front to have a bar. They are way over priced. The quality at prundale bbq is so much better. It is like a low quality rip off of santa cruz street bbq. Skip this spot and hit the prundale bbq.</Text>

We live nearby and are happy to have such a nice new restaurant in our area!  The weekend ribs are the best I’ve had in years.  You must try them.  The place is clean, friendly, affordable, and the food is yummy good!</Review>

Nice place with nice people but dont come here if you are looking for a filling meal. The food is more like appetizers to be shared and its more expensive than you’d imagine. Dont get me wrong the food is good but it just doesnt have a restaurant vibe and for my money I’d much rather go somewhere else.< /Review>

Service was veeeeery slow, our starter was served after our entree, our request for salt and pepper was delivered 3/4 the way into the meal... I get it that Covid has put a glitch in restaurant operation, but the place wasn't maxed out with patrons...either the waiter wasn't on his game, or could use some training.</review>

< review>
We stopped through here on a road trip so I can't speak about this place relative to others in the area, but it was a great stop for us. Came here midday on a Friday and service was great, food was great, decor great as well. My wife was impressed by the attention to detail like front facing USB ports on the bar, and purse hooks between the seats. Tri-tip was a solid 4/5 (they have pits on site behind the restaurant). Chicken salad was great too. We even talked to one of the owners for a bit as we were curious about the place. Some of the reviews mention poor service but we experienced great service.

One note is that you might expect a place like this to have a good selection of localish craft brews on tap which they do not (or at least did not when we went) . 8 beers on tap and only one or two were lesser known beers. They do have some by the can though. We did try a red blend which was pretty solid.

All in all I wish I had a place like this close to me for football watching.<//review>

<Text>Food is excellent. Service is less than desirable, especially the evening shift. We sat, got drinks, then forgotten. After 15 minutes I literally had to ask if they could take our order, and it was a slow evening. The waitress excuse was it was shift turnover. I’m not a fan of excuses, just apologize.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808e0179201c82c7:0xe64448ce33d515ce<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Tri-tip sandwich was excellent with the fresh peppers. Yummy! And the BBQ sauce was good enough to drink... Omg! The staff was friendly and welcoming. Will be back again next time we are in town.<//text>

<rating>2< /rating><text>I'm glad this business is here.  The BBQ tri-tip plate I ordered was very good (and a good value).  However, the service was pretty horrible.  We were in for an early dinner and the place was empty save for a couple people at the bar.  It took a solid 5 minutes for someone to bring us a menu (there were 3 people who worked there) and the waitress literally looked and acted annoyed that we were there which made us feel super awkward.  It took so long to get any service or acknowledgment at all that we were about to walk out.  Also, the wine is overpriced for the quality... It is super, um, "local" tasting.  Some wine around this area has what I describe as "Mission" flavor.  It's like the smell of the grounds and Mission in San Juan Bautista, and like musty decaying manzanita & oak, decomposing.  It's a very distinct and often overpowering flavor and their Pinots definitely had it going on.  I think it's fine, not good, but distinct, and definitely local. It was, however, overpriced/glass.  Maybe offer a tasting flight too, but definitely watch what is reasonable to charge.  Anyway, I thought the BBQ was good and price point right on, just hire a professional staff and work on the wine menu and it should do very well here.  It's a phenomenal location for a business like this.< /text>< pics>

<Review>This store has always been awesome I donate there and as an asset protection associate at a nun named store I don't feel their policy about not having backpacks and profiling. When someone is willing to spend good money is judged by their appearance I do not do that at my company nor do my associates< /Review><user_id>110643034932119882240< /user_id><Response>None</Response>< pictures>

Judgmental staff. I came out of work and visited goodwill to pass time due to a traffic jam and was followed around the whole time I'm assuming because of my dirty work clothes.<//Review>

<Text>Given the times of Covid, I called to clarify that the store and donation center was open. The woman on the phone so the donations are open until 4 PM. I loaded up my car, and 20 minutes later at 3:25 PM I arrived, it was closed. I called back and the woman said they “just closed” and suggested I come earlier. It would help customers if this location is sure that hours both posted and shared via phone are accurate with the actual hours of operation.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>The Morgan hill good will workers are lazy. They only except one 3x3 container full of items. I would rather throw my items in the trash then take them to the Morgan hill good will. Which is really safe because a lot of people could probably use these items. They say there open when they are not.</review>< pictures>

The staff here are very nice and helpful. Every time I come, I see some type of Minion related thing, which is great. And Easy Bake ovens. Lots of them. The books are (mostly) good quality. It’s like they were never read. Some clothes are worth buying, but not that many. Everything is pretty cheap. Great parking. Love coming here, can’t wait until next time.< /text>

<Text>This is a nice big store which is well organized and clean. I was able to pick up a part for my computer here at a fraction of the price I would have had to pay at a computer parts website. Thank to the good people who make Goodwill work.<//Text><rating>5< /rating>< user_name>

<Time>1536533223979< /Time><Rating>2</Rating><review>Such a bad goodwill store. Some staff are nice. But, some aren’t. One of them talked to me at such a heavy tone, that I didn’t like it at all. They could’ve talked to me more nicely or politely, but did it in where I think the employer didn’t have a good mood. They have a good selection of clothes. But, not really much merchandise. There is one store up north in Santa Teresita. Their stuff is actually good. I actually had real hopes for goodwill, but not anymore. Just by what they said, can really make you feel mad. But, I am cool tempered. Thanks goodwill.<//review>< Pictures>

This has always been my favorite Goodwill store and they still have a pretty good variety of interesting stuff but they've added in a lot of new, cheap goods that make it less fun to shop there.  Prices are ok.  Parking is excellent.  Staff are very friendly and pleasant.</review>

<Text>It's not a big store but during summer they have furniture for sale standing outside, behind the building which is good. But if you want to drop off your furniture, they sometimes take it, and other days they don't which is very frustrating if they send you away and you have to find another place to drop off your stuff.< /Text><Rating>3</Rating><resp>None</resp><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x808e20edbb87d05f:0x213cc1e8eee7be6b< /Gmap_id><user_name>Jen.

Another good store you can find some good items cheap brand new some items you have to take a chance people going through the boxes and throw everything around what's the prices were a little bit cheaper and even though they're getting the stuff for free some items they charge more than what you can buy in the store but I still love there three times a week cuz you never know what you can find which makes it kinda exciting<//review>

Very bad service friend got punched started to blead and all they said was to leave or they will call the cops. The "manager" escalated the situations by continuously tempting us and saying we were in the wrong like we provoked the employee. Employee was very unstable from the beginning and said was going to hit my friend in the face and them did.friend blead a lot on his t-shirt and floor and we where just helping him with a few other customers. Fat manager comes in with anger saying we where in the wrong even though we just talked.got ruder by the second even when we where being polite and just said we really didn't do anything wrong there employee did.</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) They have fixed the ceilings are now higher in the air circulation they have also marked the floor to avoid bumping into the front and respect the 6 ft distance. And it seems important to me to keep it open because now we are taking things out and cleaning our closet that over time we fill up.

(Original)
Le an  hecho arreglos los techos ahora están mas altos  en la circulación del aire también han marcado el piso para no toparse de frente y respetar los 6 ft de distanciamiento. Y me párese importante que se mantenga abierto por que ahora estamos sacando cosas y limpieza de nuestro clóset que con el tiempo nos  llenamos.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I am a Fireman and started seeing Doctor Funk last year as I was having lower back pain and stiffness as my job is hard on my back.

Dr. Funk is an amazing chiropractor.  My neck was stiff and achy and within 3 visits my neck pain was gone. I enjoy the roller table and the heated water bed table to relax you prior to my adjustment. Thanks Dr. Funk, I recommend anyone looking for a good chiropractor - Dr. Funk is the best<//review>

< Review>
Dr. Steve Funk is not only an amazing professional that combines fun with functionality, knowledge with actionable “know-how,” and quality information with quality treatment, but he is an overall exemplary human being. This review certainly extends over to his partnering partners and especially to his amazing staff. From the start of treatment til the end Steve communicated that his goals were to come in aggressively to alleviate the problems in order to achieve preinjury alignment or better ASAP. He is straightforward and attentive in all he does. Just 4 sessions in and my pain is right on par being at a 5/10 vs 10/10 today. Excited to do a video testimonial after the 8th treatment.< /Review>

Within a few weeks I felt better - i enjoyed the roller tables, heated water beds, Low level Laser therapy for my concussion, the vibration plate and all the exercises to help strengthen my muscles- If you’ve been in a car accident definitely give Dr. Funk a call he knows what he’s doing<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Being a former athlete I was involved in a rear end car accident at a stoplight ,in wet weather ,and was banged up pretty good, and I thought I could rehab myself. But, I was referred to Dr. Funk and after several visits my neck and back symptoms subsided, now I see him for readjustments every so often to maintain my posture! Thanks Doc!<//text>

I highly recommend Dr. Funk. He has helped me maintain good health with adjustments. The adjustments cause migraines and headaches to dissipate, better rotation in back and hips.  If you have any type of physical and health issues, call Dr. Funk. He is friendly, compassionate and caring.< /Text>

I was in a lot of pain for awhile and decided to try Dr. Funk out, as he had so many great reviews. All I can say is the reviews were spot on! I'm no fan to pain, especially if it means popping and cracking things to make the pain go away. Just one visit and I am sitting without pain for the first time in about a month. I recommend this practice.<//Text>

<Review>I visited this location, but became very uncomfortable with how basic COVID-19 procedures were handled. I filled out paperwork in the office that couldn't have been more than 100 sq. ft.  Next to 3 patients who were not wearing masks as well as the receptionist who was also not wearing a mask. I bit my tongue through the paperwork, thinking I could wait outside the front door while I waited for my appointment to be filled, but was extremely disappointed when I witnessed a chiropractor and a patient walk from the back, both not wearing masks. At this point I politely set my unfinished paperwork on their desk, apologized, and left.

I will say nothing regarding the quality of the chiropractic care. I did not experience it myself therefore I am unable to have an opinion on it, and I'm positive that they do a very good job in that regard due to the outstanding reviews I have read about Dr. Funk and the recommendations I have received from others. That being said, I would not recommend visiting this office until the pandemic has passed.

The lack of basic preventative measures is very disappointing, and I would expect anyone with the title of Doctor to have a greater respect for the health and safety of their patients. There are plenty of other well qualified chiropractors in the area, and maybe once COVID has passed my opinion will be moot, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this office.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Dr Funk is great to work with. He is always busy, but always makes time and is quick, yet thorough with your care. Great place to get in and get out, or for more intensive care. He was also extremely helpful in dealing with insurance, lawyers, any any other needs regarding accident injury.< /text>

<Review>Dr Funk helped me be able to drive all the way back home to Eugene, Oregon after my back had been out a whole week while I was visiting my family in Modesto. I was in so much pain I could habe screamed and cried all day and night. If I had not been referred by my sister to Dr Funk, I would have not made it home. With one adjustment, my pain was almost gone, I could walk straight again, and I was not as stiff. Thank you so much for your help. You are truly a blessing I am sure to everyone you work on. I wish your business was in Oregon. I have to stop by this summer when I visit again.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1583605947409, 'text': 'Valerie I’m glad I was able to help you and had a great drive home with less pain - I look forward to getting you adjusted this summer.- you have an amazing family - and I am blessed to be able to have family members bring in other family members'}</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Funks chiropractic is definitely the place to be if you have any kind of back, shoulder, joint etc. pain.

I got adjusted at Dr. Funk chiropractic and my back has never felt better! Dr. Funk truly cares about his patients and personally works with each individual to find the best treatment plan for them. If you are looking for a chiropractor Dr. Funk’s office is the place to go. He’s got your back!

Had pain in my shoulder from a sports injury and couldn’t get any relief with just rest. Dr. Funk started adjusting my shoulder (he is amazing in adjusting extremities) and it is healing very quickly with only a few adjustment!! I would highly recommend Dr. Funk for all back and neck pain, but also for any other joint pain...wrist, shoulder, knees...etc! You will be glad you came!!<//review>

He's intuitive and educated, and wants his clients to know what's going on  and why, so he can help them heal. I will definitely be coming back here regularly!<//text>< Pics>

Hi everyone, Id like to start off by saying Dr. Funk is the man! I have been out of work for a month with a pinched sciatic nerve. I went to Kaiser early on and they only prescribed me pills and physical therapy. They had me on 4-5 different medications. Nothing was working. I went in yesterday to his office in Old Roseville.
I filled out some standard paperwork, and I was on my way to the roller table. It felt amazing. After that, I went to the lower back stretching table. That felt good. He then hit me with THE LASERS! After that, I got adjusted. He then offered to loan me a back brace and a TENS unit to shock the spot in my buttocks that was preventing me from walking correctly. I used it all night, and it worked. I woke up this morning to being able to stand up straighter and walk better. A couple more visits and I'll be right! Super affordable too. A few times to him for $140 vs Kaiser a bunch of times at about $200-300. If you are hurting GO! I'm a Steel worker by trade. DR. Funk works!</review>

I've been a patient of Dr. Funk's for about 5 years now. He has tremendously helped me get out of pain fast. I've been in quite a few car accidents myself and he has helped me recover fast. I still have flare ups now and then and he helps me get out of pain quickly. Highly recommend!<//text>

< Review>
I am so lucky that I stumbled upon Dr. Funk & his practice! From the machines that he uses to make your body feel better, to his actual Chiropractic ethics are top notch for me! I have Degenerative Disc Disease on my L5 & S1. He was also able to refer me to go get an X-ray here locally for a very reasonable price also. His techniques really have helped my pain where I don't have to take any medication's! Coming 3x a week helps my life more than he can imagine! We're working on getting me down to once a month, which I thought would be just as bad as not going, but it actually is what is needed for your body & it works! He really knows what he's doing & gets the worst pain possible to feel better in one session! I can't thank Dr. Funk & his team to really understand what I'm going through & treat you like life long friend's! Thanks so much Doc!< /Review>

<Review>I just moved to the area, and I’m so glad I found Dr Funk!  I had a sports related injury, and I could hardly move my back without pain.  In one adjustment, he fixed what turned out to be a dislocated rib and I was like a new person!  I was immediately able to return to my daily activities, and I feel fantastic!!  I highly recommend Dr. Funk!  He has advanced modern technology and several therapy machines that make a huge difference making quick healing possible!  I will be back!!< /Review>< Pictures>

Fantastic. Involved in a car accident a few weeks ago, I went from feeling like I was hit by a semi to just being achy in a few short weeks. I still have a few weeks of treatment to go, but I'm healing much faster than I thought I would. The massages are also great, she does a good job getting where you need to be worked.< /Text>

<Text>I went to Dr. Funk's office because I was experiencing a lower back pain that just wouldn't go away. The pain was shooting into my side  and my stomach area and was present constantly making it hard to stand, sit or walk for longer periods of time. After only two weeks of seeing Dr. Funk, I am pain free again! He has a variety of equipment in the office like a roller table, laser, vibration plate to help relax the muscles and facilitate the healing. Dr. Funk listened to my concerns and questions and thoughroughly answered them and explained his treatment plan for me. I felt a decrease in pain level after the first adjustment and kept following the treatment plan. And I am so glad I did! Thank you, Dr. Funk.<//Text>< GmapID>

Great experience as always at Funk Chiropractic. I have had athletic injuries with my shoulder, back, and ankle and each time I have greatly benefited from the amazing work I have received. Dr. Funk always goes the extra mile to explain what specific areas are being affected and how to remedy the issues. Dr. Funk is passionate about his work and people, and it shows through his tireless spirit of care and education. I will definitely be referring my family and friends as they have done to me.</Text>

Best Chiropractor 👨‍⚕️ ever. I went in with shoulder injury and lower back pain. After just 5 visits, I was back on my feet and able to go to work. He knows what he’s doing and no not all chiropractors make the paint worst. If you are looking for a good chiropractor and want to get rid of pain ASAP... see Dr. Funk. 😁</Review>

After three months of adjustments and massaging, my pain had dropped from 8-9 down to 1 on the 10 point scale. I want to than  Dr.  Funk for his dedication to help people like me. He is the doctor I trust. Also, I want to say thank you to Slav the masseur, and Tress who is very sweet and kind.
I strongly recommend Dr. Funk's Chiropractic.

I am 65 years old. I do most of my work at the computer. About two months ago, I developed severe pain in the left shoulder and lumbar area.
I tried home remedies ie, ice, heat, and ibuprofen for a few weeks. Nothing worked. I found Dr. Funk on Yelp. He has many positive reviews.
I made an appointment, and after four sessions I am pain free! I highly
recommend him and will be back if
I have any signs of back pain again!< /Text>

<Review>Dr. Funk saw me promptly as a walk-in. He was very friendly and professional. He set me up on the roller table while I waited for him to finish working with another patient. I feel so much better after one session and will definitely be back fo more adjustments!< /Review>< pictures>

<review>I was in a car accident and got rear ended in June 2017. I woke up with a headache each day and my neck was so stiff l couldn't even turn my neck to drive. Dr Funk started working with me and l first was a little skeptical, but he fixed my stiff neck and my headaches are gone! Thank you Dr Funk for helping me get back on my feet again 💕  The massages was very helpful and the office staff even went and got me some ice. A great environment for a speedy recovery. I can recommend Dr Funk Chiropractic to anyone with severe pain!</review>< pics>

<text>Dr. Funk is the real deal. I've seen other chiropractors and even had a membership with "The Joint".  They don't come close to the expertise of Dr. Funk. He is a caring guy and listens to my needs.  I have horrible neck issues and he is the only one that can fix them.  Wish I could go more.< /text><gmap_id>0x809b1fe9468de263:0x665e15dc3b096133< /gmap_id>< user>

<review>I've seen Dr Funk for years. I saw him regularly for awhile to treat some long seated issues. And eventually I was able to move to a more maintence schedule. I still visit when I do something wacky and something goes out of place. He is a great chiropractor. He's funny caring and knowledgeable and somehow always finds time when I call to squeeze in for the day. The spine can cause muscle issues so a chiropractor is the place to start. And Dr Funk is the man to help you along.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1533218394097<//Date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>So, as a new patient I was told to plan on an hour for my visit. What I wasn't told was that the hour was wait time not time with Dr. Funk. I had been waiting 45 minutes and then they took a walk in in front of me. When I questioned why I needed to come in so early only to wait around (during a work day) that's when I was told this is why they ask you to plan for an hour.

I had been willing to reschedule when I first got there and saw two people already waiting. I was reassured they would get me out in an hour. Was Dr. Funk really going to go over all of my paperwork, my concerns AND work on me in 15 minutes based on the time remaining? Plus, taking a walk in before me? That isn't good service. I know he has good reviews and his work may be fine, but my time has to be valued as well.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x809b1fe9468de263:0x665e15dc3b096133<//gmapID></record>

Great adjustments. Dr Funk's office is awesome, he has roller table, back massage chair, foot massage chair and more. I come in early and do the rounds on all the equipment and then get my adjustment. 5 stars.< /Review>

My name is Dwight and I'm a local business owner. I've been seeing Dr. Funk for several years now.

Dr. Funk and his crew have a unique and thorough approach to treating the spine and body. I'm feeling better now than I have for years and I have a greater range of motion than I've had in decades.

Thanks Dr. Funk!<//review>

Incredible practitioner! Having worked for a chiropractor for over a year and receiving chiropractic care for over 4, I am quite particular about my care. Dr. Funk is an incredible and honest practitioner. He has so many physical therapy tools for spinal traction in his office that you can use before your adjustment while you wait to be seen. You really get the works here. Don't be afraid to ask for additional adjustments; if you have pain he will help you out! Don't hesitate to call Dr. Funk! You will never regret being out of pain and preserving spinal disc health and integrity going forward.<//review>

My need for chiropractic care was long over due when my husband told me about a chiropractor he had just met. With the convient location of the clinic, affordable prices and my husbands recommendation I decided to give Dr.Funk a try. I've been pleased with the friendly environment, multiple massage tables/chairs and most importantly the adjustments that have helped tremendously. Thank you Dr. Funk for helping me to achieve better health.<//review>

I have known him for 7 years now and he has helped me through all my long time sports injuries from the beginning of my competitive years to my college playing years. He adjusts my shoulders, knees, back, and has helped with my ankle sprains. And every time I leave I always feel 100%. Recommend him highly to anyone looking to be adjusted.<//review>

<review>Dr Funk is an amazing chiropractor that really understands how the body works and extremities too. I had a chronic ongoing injury to my left shoulder and neck. Dr Funk has been helping decrease my neck and shoulder pain that I have had for over a year And my range of motion has incerased - Wow - what a blessing - if you have neck or shoulder pain I would definitely recommend Dr Funk

I've been going to Dr Funk for about 6 years now. As a Professional Golfer and Longdriver I put tremendous amount of strain on my back and shoulders. He's kept Me in top shape for all events. After injuring my back he saved me from back surgery. Very thankful.<//text>

<Review>I’ve been a client of Dr. Funk’s since 2010. He helped me get into the Navy as my spine was crooked. Over the years I have dislocated my wrist, hyperextended both knees, slipped a disk in my back, and countless other sports injuries and he has helped me through all of it. He is my go to for any ache and pain that comes my way. I trust him completely and recommend him to anyone. I always leave feeling much better than when I came in and will continue to visit him often. He is not only the best chiropractor but he’s a great guy!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< UserId.>

What I like most about Dr. FUNK is he spends quality time with each patient, working on the areas that give me trouble. Since seeing him my back and hip have improved greatly, especially with the home excercises he gave me.

I felt great after he administered adjustments and physical therapy for me. I have continued seeing Dr. Funk for maintenance through the years. I was in a car accident in late 2012 where I injured the whole left side of my body. Again he repaired my injuries. He is fantastic!

<user>103437123850119185083< /user><Name>Matt Worley</Name><review>Dr funk has been such a huge help in my wife's recovery. She threw her back out just doing everyday things and it wasn't getting any better.  After a doctors visit they gave her muscle relaxers and pain meds which helped ease the pain but as soon as it wore off she was in excruciating pain. She has never been to a chiropractor and was terrified of the thought. She has always been really scared of the thought of someone adjusting her spine but with the level of pain she was willing to try anything. We found Dr funk and he got us in the same day and adjusted my wife. Next day she felt so much better and we went back 2 days later and she has almost no pain. Given the amount of pain she was in and the short time it took to make her feel so much better is amazing. Thank you Dr Funk for helping her.<//review>< rating>

Dr Funk treated me after a car accident I was suffering from neck, mid and low back pain, plus shoulder and ribs were painful too- Dr Funk has a different approach than many other chiropractors I have seen. The treatment also included some advanced chiropractic equipent and spinal rehab and massage therapy by Slavi -   I highly recommend Dr Funk and his team if your in pain< /Text>

I came in 15 minutes sooner and was first in line, and also had the appointment reserved prior by phone yet he still took people in ahead of me for some strange reason, maybe they were friends otherwise have no idea why. its like a market there, he takes about 4 people at same time taking turns to talk to each. the equipment is not properly sanitized and my hands smelled fairly bad after touching the chiropractic table had to wash several times. dr. Funk is nice and seems fairly knowledgeable but that is not the way to do business, I think it is fair to assume that he puts money in priority above the patient because of how he takes 4-5 patients each time and doens't provide enough time or attention. I am also convinced of this because they tried to sell a medical belt in a very clever way, plus I didnt really need it.
also I asked for receipt but reception lady could not provide it for some reason. and I scheduled a package that said it included massage but there was no massage they simply put you on massage machine.
to make things even worse I got a really bad cold after going there, the receptionist lady was sick when I came that time so probably got it from her.
I think this is ridiculous. I don't know how he got so many good reviews or if they are all real, or maybe people that go there haven't seen better service. I'm used to seeing a chiropractor and paying for whole hour where I can ask all questions calmly and get a real massage and attention needed, where the massage table is cleaned each time with new sheets. I think this is normal and not sure why dr funk thinks otherwise. not happy at all.</text>

<review>Make sure to take all vehicle's on test drive, took a jeep on test drive that had "nothing wrong" it was an automatic and died three times while driving and overheated , just make sure to test vehicle's before buying, no guarantee the car is actually what they say it is.</review>< GmapID>

<review>Such an excellent place to get a vehicle for the most affordable price! Friendly staff, very knowledgeable. Even though this whole virus is going on, which is a bummer,  there are benefits.. such as this place no longer does auctions.  All prices are set so there is no competing with other customers, which is great!<//review><GmapID>0x8082fcc262918ba5:0xd8812a1b732fc231< /GmapID><Response>None<//Response><name>Heather Disgustemailaddress<//name>< pics>

We got a nice vehicle, luckily no issues or nothing wrong what's so ever, just be warned, if you come here thinking this is the place to go to get cars for cheap, always make sure to have a lump sum of extra money when you plan to bid for a car.
There is alot of fees, taxes, and charges for buying a car from the auction, we had up to $850 extra bucks to pay off from our bidding price, 200 of that being dmv stuff so beware, do not expect to pay what you bid for, it will most likely be 400-1000 more of fees added, especially higher the bid price.

Here's the deal. They have "house bidders". So be very carefull. Be sure you go the day before to check them out and take notes.So you know the right car to bid on. Sometimes there is more than one of the cars your lookin at.Take your time....youll have fun. They sold ours to us, said it had 4 wheele drive...nope< /Text>

One of the most Shady auto auctions in California I've been to. Sold a car knowing that it had transmission issues and wouldn't honor any type of return no credit no nothing not even willing to work with me. Be careful when you get vehicles from this place they are worth the headache.</Review>

I've bought several vehicles from this auction and not one of them had, or ended up with any problems... To this day!
I "HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS AUCTION TO 'ANYONE' THAT NEEDS A GOOD VEHICLE, THATS ALSO SOMEWHAT NEW AND DOESN'T HAVE VERY MUCH TO SPEND ON A VEHICLE"
Just because they sell them for more than a reasonable price... There's nothing wrong with them! If there happens to be something wrong with the vehicle they have it written on the windows with window markers! I love this place! They haven't been open for 22yrs for nothing<//text>

The first time I bought a car here, it was great. I came back 2 years later, in March, the auctioneer was completely unprofessional, I bid $1,750 for a car, after a LONG time of trying to get a higher bid of $2000 he didn’t get it, and pointed to me, sold for $2000. When told he was incorrect and that I bid $1750, he insisted i was wrong and made me pay the extra $250. I left extremely disappointed in the out come of this auction.</review>

<review>Auctioneer very unprofessional. Stopping in the middle of bids to up sell the cars. Then forgetting what the bid was and starting over. Telling people the cars have leather seats and after market rims when they are factory and not leather. Telling people in the middle of bidding that the car has 200 thousand miles all freeway when there is no possible way that he could know that. Jumping bids from $1,500 to $2,700 when only one other person bid. Starts speaking Spanish in the middle of bidding to where most people have no idea what the bid is. All around the auction was nice. But the auctioneer was trash. It sucks one guy could ruin it for every one. His sons did great spotting bids and working with bidders. The apple must fall very far from the tree.< /review><time>1363014426770</time><GmapID>0x8082fcc262918ba5:0xd8812a1b732fc231</GmapID><rating>2</rating></record>

Don't waste your time here. The auctioneer is really pushy and tries to over sell cars that clearly have something wrong with them, otherwise they wouldn't be there. My friend over bid $2250, ended up paying $3000 out the door after all the fees for something worth $500 on kelly blue book and has issues that are only noticeable once you actually drive in the road, which you can't do at the auction site until you buy one of these cars. Do yourself a favor and just get one from craigslist because at least then you can test drive it and know exactly what you're spending.</text>

You can get a deal. Just depends on the other people bidding. Watched quite a few people pay way to much. Auctioneer can be rude.<//Text>

It takes time a little time to learn the ropes but be open to a Lot Of Information. The teachers are great and they will explain any moves any time. Just ask! Stefan is my favorite by far. The energy is great. I feel this is the best workout if you are competitive.

Always show up on time and a little earlier than usual before class because parking can be a little tricky since there Are popular shops around. Just show up 5 minutes before class to be safe.

They have a cancellation fee if you don’t show up to class you registered or want to cancel last minute (Not my favorite)  but in a way I think it’s good because  it makes you follow through with your commitment and hurts your pocket if you back off. (Good accountability if you ask me).

I also like that is a month to month service and you can upgrade or downgrade your plan if you want to or need to.<//Text>< user_name>

Several months ago I decided to join orange theory, I made Torrance my home gym. I love how every time you come you get an amazing work out and you never can fully anticipate what the day will hold, keeping you from boredom! After several months of committing to working out daily and eating a balanced diet, I am 17 pounds down and looking forward to meeting my goal very soon of 25 pounds!

I have no complaints, the staff are friendly and the trainers are good. I would recommend orange theory in general but I  also like their Torrence location!<//Text>

<review>I have been a member for 4 months as of today and I have to say it’s life changing I feel so much better about my body and healthy. I can’t wait to continue my journey and see where I am a year into OTF.... I shout this place to the roof tops and the Torrance location has great trainers and amazing staff I feel like family when I’m there! I take the 7am class who wants to work out at 7am but as soon as I step through those doors I’m excited to work out and start my day!<//review><GmapID>0x80dd4b034eb674c9:0xd1db7bfb155018d1</GmapID>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Always a challenge!! I've gained strength, endurance and tone while I've been there. Every time I go, I surprise myself with what I can do! I'm in the best of my life, even when I ran track in high school! I'm super thankful for the workout and would recommend it to anyone. Also, its the longest consecutive amount of time that I've been going to the gym. Usually I fall off the wagon after a month or two. This workout (and the results!!) give me real motivation to keep going!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I love that the workout is never the same, so I can’t dread coming to class on Endurance days ;).  It’s always heart pumping and I appreciate that everyone can challenge themselves at their own level.  The coaches and staff at the Redondo Beach studio are a central reason to sticking with this workout.  They’re helpful and motivating and always have something kind to say!< /text>

All I have to do is show up. You guys do the rest for me.  I also like all the times and days available to me. I can always fit in a workout even with my crazy single-mom schedule.</text>

<Review>Coach Kailey's class has routinely been one of my favorites to attend throughout the southland. I wish I had more reasons to be in the area other than sporadic work opportunities, but when I am I know my time at OTF Torrance will be energetic, motivating and positive. I've been on an admittedly long journey to get back into shape so it's priceless to leave a challenging class feeling a little bit better about myself. The front desk staff are always warm & welcoming making the experience from start-to-finish a worthwhile time in anyone's day.</Review>< pics>

They really push you to your limit but help you reach your goal. I will be going for a while and I know they will help me reach my goal. Keep it up and I will recommend my family and friends. Also the sales rep ALI keep it up bro and make those sales to people who aren’t convinced.</text>< Pics>

<review>The classes are great, however they will not allow me to transfer my membership even though I went in person in AUGUST 2017 (it is now NOVEMBER 2017). Horrible customer service and after reviewing the matter many other Customers have had the same issue. There are literally websites devoted to their horrible costumer service.< /review>< pictures>

I love the unique Heart Rate fitness based workout model - for me, it's very motivating to see how I, as well as my fellow members, are performing during the workout and helps me push harder! I also love the coaches - very passionate about what they do and inspire me to give it my all!<//Text>

I like OTF, it adds a the much needed weights and cardio to my usually yoga routine. The space is well organized, open, and clean. It is nice having someone else plan a well designed workout that focuses on weights and cardio and keeps me in check.</text>

I like that I don't have to think. I think for work and working out should only be physically hard. Stefan's class is my favorite, but every trainer is great.< /Text>

<review>I am obsessed with OTF.  I convinced my sister to join and my gf to join when she was traveling in Tampa. I have been coming for a few months and can totally see how my body has changed. The classes fly by and you come out feeling like you had a kick ass workout.  The heart rate monitor keeps you motivated to earn those splat points.  Each work out is different so your body is constantly being challenged.  I would definitely look into taking the intro class if you are thinking about joining because once you do you won't stop.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>Staff is helpful and friendly. The coaches are all amazing but Steffan is my favorite so far. Never had a workout or class stick. I’ve tried yoga, Pilates, gyrotonics, running clubs, gym subscriptions...but I’m absolutely addicted to orangetheory. I have a two year old and haven’t worked out since before i was pregnant. It’s challenging and enjoyable that even thought I’m juggling work and home i will make time, ask my husband to take our son for an hour, so i can do this. I already feel stronger and healthier and it’s only been two months. The price is right too.</review></record>

I've been going OTF torrance for 8 months now and I love it! I love the classes, the instructors and specifically,  this location. The management and staff are very friendly and it's just a great, positive and encouraging environment. OTF is good for all fitness levels. I highly recommend trying out one of the classes, and joining.<//Text>

<Date>1481056347341<//Date><Rating>1</Rating><text>The one star rating is due to the extremely poor business management at the Torrance facility. After more than a year as a founding member, I am cancelling my membership over a billing error that was OTF's fault. I was charged the wrong amount on my November 2016 bill.  Several emails between myself and "management" to get the issue resolved were frustrating. Ultimately, my account was credited, however, a new billing cycle went into effect and as a consequence my 4 classes for the November billing cycle were forfeited.  OTF owes me those classes for the inconvenience it caused me;the delay in crediting my credit card account; the change in the billing cycle without advance notice or consent by me; and extremely poor and erroneous accounting on its part.
I tried to work with the so-called manager, Joyce, at the facility who couldn't grasp my exasperation at entire incident. Her view was my account got credited, end of story. She totally dismisses the fact that due to the changes in the billing cycle, I'm shortchanged classes. Regardless of whether the account was credited, OTF was at fault and should make it right.

I visited OTF on December 5, 2016, planning to cancel my membership. A manager at the facility upon hearing my story and understanding that OTF messed up, credited my account for the classes. However,  Joyce overrode his decision.  I've tried to contact the corporate office, but it seems each franchise is independently owned an operated and issues with facilities are to be taken up at the local level.  I'm tired of trying to deal with an incompetent "manager" who knows nothing about customer service so goodbye OTF.< /text>< Pictures>

The service was okay but a little way. They need more service there to help you. They only had one person in the store. There's enough parking place there. That place is neat and clean. The neighborhood is okay. Not too hard to find. The food is okay.<//review>

<review>28 minutes in line here still waiting to order and typing this up...  but actually what really gets to me is the poor kid working behind the counter all by himself. There’s a long line of customers waiting to order, a few groups of people dining-in, and it’s a weekend night... yet there’s just one person working behind the counter. HOW?! WHY?! Management/owners squeezing pennies, that’s how and why. The poor guy is taking orders, making the sandwiches, ringing people up, restocking the condiments, tending to the ovens, ALL ON HIS OWN. What kind of madness is this??<//review><userid>118243199057078593243</userid>< username>

One of the worst subways to go to. Unfortunately it’s the closest to me and I try to avoid this location. The reason being, the larger woman who has a Spanish accent will always try to push extra meat or extra cheese to rack up your bill and when polity declined she frowns and rushes you out and makes your sandwich poorly ..it never fails. When I ask to add advacado to my 6” sandwich she will gladly cut the tiniest sliver and rush your sandwich so you can’t see how little avacado you’re actually getting for the additional charge. I’ve held my tongue for too long on my opinion of this location but people have the right to know that these employees rush you through the line which I have witnessed employees move so quickly that a finished sandwhich flew unto the floor and employees laughed. As a paying customer this isn’t funny or professional. A food establishment should never make you feel rushed or like you are bothering them to make your simple sandwich. That is why these employees have a job. The larger Spanish woman is unwelcoming, unfriendly and only wants to hike up your bill and if you choose not to- she’s done with you. Because of her Unwelcoming bad attitude I will gladly drive to the Subway located on foothill with the owner Lynn and her wonderful team. That establishment is worth an extra 20 min drive. I hope people will be treated better than I have been at this Ontario location. I will never be back.<//text>

<review>Worst experience, they started off making my bmt sandwich, then another employee walks buy and says there’s too much pepperoni right before they’re going to toast it. So they open the sandwich and take off pepperonis right in front of me. I felt embarrassed and no longer wanted the sandwich.

<text>28 minutes to get 2 toasted tuna sandwiches with one person ahead of me being serviced. the lady moves slower as a turtle and requires the order be repeated multiple times despite the lack of a rush,  a crowd,  or what I deem to be excessive noise. she may even have been sick but either way I get to try to break the record for fastest time eating a footlong because by time I got back to my office I had 7 minutes to eat.

Greeted immediately upon arrival. Wait time to receive service is usually not more than up to ten minutes. Give Aimie an opportunity to assist you she knows how to get you what you want in a phone. Definitely a friendly environment to visit. I appreciated there was seating and something to watch though your stay will not be long it is quite pleasant.<//Text>

<text>Came into the store today for an upgrade and to add a line. Aimee was super friendly, helpful and took care of what I came in for. She provided me all the terms and conditions and offered various upgrades for me to think about. It was a painless experience and Aimee was very helpful!<//text>< Response>

James ALWAYS, does an excellent job with the details regarding new devices. He'll go out of his way to make sure you get what YOU WANT as a customer. Thanks again James, in fact I'm on on my way back to the store to transfer my contacts over to my S21 ULTRA. It was supposed to arrive some time early next week. Ordered it yesterday! VERY SATISFYING 😉<//text>

Delvin is so cool! He loves what he does and his willingness to help is encouraging. I went to pay my bill and he was so quick to offer me options on how to pay. He was friendly, detailed, empathetic and most of all knowledgeable. I spent less than five minutes in the store which is  a rarity! Great job sir! Keep on keeping on.</Review>

Let me start off by saying that this is the first at&t I have been too and they associates are super nice and friendly. They acknowledged every single person that walked in and let everyone know they will be with them shortly. Chris was my salesperson and hands on the best one I have encountered. He was patient, kind, and understanding. He helped me trade in my phone and upgrade, separate my numbers , and set up all the iphones. He was so helpful and awesome! Thank you Chris! I will definitely be coming back to you.< /Review>

< Review>
James is the manager at first when he was making a sale he was more friendly after I needed to do a return he was very unfriendly. I think he needs to be consistent rather purchasing or returning. He go so mad at first he was willing to waive the restock fee but i started to ask questions and with his attitude being so rudely I decided to return everything so he charged me $55 restock fee. His jokes not funny and he is just an unfriendly customer service manager that I rather not go to anymore. Someone is going to tell him about is smart mouth and attitude. That att will never get a single dime out of me ever again<//Review>

< Review>
I went to this store in September 2019 to use the BOGO credit. Marissa Salazar told us that we are qualified for the BOGO. Then we purchased two phones to use the benefit of this offer. After 3 months, the customer service of at&t told us that you were not qualified for the $300 credit of BOGO, then the store did not accept their responsibility for this terrible mistake. Now, we are 10 users in the account. Then we unanimously decided to switch to the Verizon to punish the at&t. I also warn my friends who are coming here to not use the service from at&t.< /Review>

<Review>MARISSA AND HECTOR have the worst possible customer service I have ever seen in my life. They lied to cover their jobs they did not help me with my order.

No one answer the question properly ... we had been mislead by one of the staff and that cost us $300 ... no one take the responsibility ... I even called the ATT royalty center and they accepted that the branch made the problem but nobody solved it ... Ridicules!!!< /text>< pictures>

– Market people that work there or not very nice they don't smile they're not welcoming but they have what I need and they're very expensive because neighborhood stores are expensive I believe they should lower some of their prices and maybe a lot more people's may come in the store to buy more things the store kind of looks like a swap meet instead of a neighborhood store that you would go in with a market or something<//Text>

This market charges you for using credit card . And half there items are pricy for a small bag of rice is 5.66 + tax. I would rather just go to the dollar tree and buy them there for a dollar<//Text>

<user>118098417738576158765</user><review>Not horrible, but not great. A couple of the owners are funny and friendly.

Prices are not listed on A LOT of the items, so my daughter and I get to the counter with two bottles of soda and a bag of chips and the total comes to $10. Overpriced but they get away with it because the store is close to a lot of apartments and easy for people to walk to it.

Basically, It's an okay place for an occasional snack or to pick up milk or water really quick, but for extended shopping needs, go somewhere else. .<//review>< Pics>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2b49337321f81:0xdd05dd76d41c822b<//Gmap_id><review>A great hidden gem for Mexicsn food. I frequently drive about 40 miles to eat there,  because it IS that excellent. Free parking is always available in the lot out front and to the side of the business.
The Fish Taco plate, my personal favourite, is a taste bud explosion of pleasure. The fish is really great, and the crunchy outside is perfect. Never over or undercooked, just perfect.
A little fresh lime squeeze, provided with the dish, on the tacos and wow, amazing. The beans and rice are perfectly cooked, soft and fresh.
The sauces are made fresh onsite, the salsas, always fresh. The vegetable bar is clean, sanitary, and well stocked with fresh carrots, radishes, etc. I have never had any dishes there that were not exceptional both in taste and quality. Great selection of many drinks, from the self serve soda machine. They have traditional Mexican bottled and canned drinks chilled nice and cold, in the cooler to the right of the cash register. The whipped pineapple and horchata drinks on tap are fresh and taste great. Coffee is hot, and fresh. The facility is clean and well run. Staff are friendly, attentive, and your food is prepared very quickly. Special requests are honoured by the cooks. There is a dining area inside, with tables and chairs, and a big screen TV for entertainment.
A Stellar place. A CW 10 out of 10, Yeh, good 2 go on in, rating.

Check it out if you want awesome Mexican food. Reasonably priced as well. They are open until 9PM, for those like myself, whose business days frequently extend into the evening, and are left with very limited options for fresh food after 8pm. You will not be disappointed.</review><time>1580168867592< /time>< userid>

<text>I don’t know how this place has 4 stars.  It’s mediocre food and bad service.  We asked the server today if they could make a quesadilla with corn tortillas because my son is allergic to wheat.  The have corn tortillas.  The server said no.  We asked why and she said my boss says no.  Was listening to her head phones the whole time. She laid out the food and never told us until we checked on it later.  It definitely wasn’t worth it.</text>< rate>

I just had the best carne asada taco that I have ever tasted at Pancho's Tacos. It was full of flavor and served piping hot. They gave me an adequate portion size as well. I will go out of my way to return for more!!! Thanks Pancho for taking pride in your product.</Review>

Cheap but no flavor and dry, maybe it was an off day. Fish tacos is the preprocessed fish-finger kind just fyi (was maybe my favorite over asada and barbacoa)</review>

<text>Bacon and egg breakfast burrito was awesome $5.11 after tax for a huge delicious stuffed burrito that was super clean and easy to eat. Will absolutely come back again to try other things! It's next to 7/11 across from the 76 gas station.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I had the bacon breakfest burrito my co worker had the ham and the egg was over cooked the bacon was hard and tasteless also the hash browns were like little tater tots not very good at all, my co worker couldn't finish off half of it and he can eat anything trust me I've seen it.I had to throw my out also, I didnt have time to say something. I would recommend to SKIP this place for breakfast burrittos.I have to say that burrito made it to my top worst burritos list.</Text>

<review>For your typical street tacos, this is probably your best bet for the area. It is more pricey than what you would get in LA, but it's understandable considering the rent is more expensive here. It's great they have a salsa bar with the traditional condiments. Fast and friendly service too.<//review>< Pictures>

Very Disappointing place!
Overpriced....... cashier ready to take order as you walk in... no greeting!
Chile verde is posted on window and when asked to the cook how s best to serve he answered its our carnitas and our tomatillo sauce! Haha that’s not Chile verde! It’s carnitas with tomatillo sauce.. got it?
No wonder this place or location can’t stay in business for a while!
Hard. To think a cook and a cashier can run a small restaurant!< /Review>

Had the taquitos. Not great, not bad. Pro ably wouldn't get those again, but would be willing to try another menu item. Crappy parking, since it's shared with 7-11.< /Text>

Its not a date place but its a step or two above other taco joints. Their meat is always fresh and not loaded with chunks of fat. They have the best carne asada tacos and their habanero salsa is one of a kind/ delicioso! It is usually very spicy when mixed with jalepenos, carrots and radish. I have been treating myself to Panchos for about five years now and I have never been disappointed with their asada tacos or machaca burritos.< /Text>

I've only had the tacos from here. Meat wasn't seasoned very well. The salsa and side trimmings looked like they had been sitting out all day. Overall not a pleasant visit.<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Bad food and everything is salty. They buy the carnitas and the chicken is d rrostizado and the carnitas cecas. The sauces are disgusting for your jalapeños, let alone. The past lemons and fish tacos are made with pancake fish from the conjelador. Anyway, expensive and bad food. Hopefully they put something different. Last place

I asked for my order to be prepared fresh & hot and it was the opposite the fries were hard and cold. McDonald's shouldn't serve fries unless there fresh & hot. Why do we have to request our food to be fresh, it should just be fresh off the press. These fast food places kills me and there getting worse.
Their customer service skills are poor, they have language barriers. I need to protest against these fast food joints.<//review>

<Review>This place is literally the worst mcdonalds I've had the unfortunate pleasure of eating from. They forget to add items into your bag and when you go back to tell them they apologize but do nothing about it, making your wait even longer. If I owned this mcdonalds I would definitely clean house and get somewhat competent workers.<//Review>< pictures>

I admire this spot! They give tasty food, their menu is varied, The chef in that place is a real pro, I enjoy a lot trying all their dishes. The food is consistently fresh and tasty, the attitude towards the visitors  is very good too. I frequently visit this restaurant and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it to all.</Text>

<Review>What a horrible experience I had today, I came to order the spicy chicken nuggets  and also ordered a coffee with cream. The lady asked if I wanted the hot sauce for the spicy chicken nuggets and I said yeah  but, I never got the spicy sauce! My coffee had no cream in it, and it didn’t have any of those small packages of cream either.My day was going off to a good start but, this seriously ruined my day.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2ca1c3dff2eef:0x4e1b449db3fccd2b</gmap_id><Time>1601150608455<//Time></record>

I went to get four spicy mcChicken with a happy meal and two mcRibs combo. I bought three drinks and they forgot to give me my happy meal and forgot the straws for my drinks. The bread for the mcChickens were Nasty. I understand is very busy but please pay more attention to the food and the service. We pay to eat fresh food not nasty breads. My friends and I went to the beach to have our meals and We couldn't enjoy our drinks because no straws. PLEASE PUT MORE ATTENTION!!!</text>

They have the worst service. I went there yesterday and i ordered a sausage McGriddle add cheese and bacon. They gave me a biscuit and i told them the correct order. They told me to park and we waited about 10 min and they gave us the sandwhich but it was a bacon and egg McGriddle 😐. I told them the order again. I waited another 10 minutes and like 3 people came out and asking what my order was and the manager said oh an egg McGriddle like no...where did i say anything about eggs in my sandwhich and that took more time. It took 4 people to get the order right. Not to mention the wait. And on other days i come here the drive thru wait time is 20 min to 1hr. I used to work there and it is literally the worst location and it’s like some of the staff are really stupid and clueless🌝 i really didn’t get how hard a sausage McGriddle add bacon and cheese was. 🤔< /Text>

Horrible service. All the employees are always clueless. Came to pick up an order and the employee tells me order isn't ready so to park in the front. Waited 15 mins for another employee to come out and tell me that my order was given out already. Told him why did the other employee tell me they are still making my order and he is telling me it was given out already. Had no explanation. Made me waist 30 mins of my time.</Review>

Something is weird in this mcdonalds it feels like they steel your money , you order three items and when you're going to the window they come up that only they only charge you two items and the price is is weird, hi sweet Jess that at corporation Manor or something should do something or investigate something in the McDonald's because they will charge you a lot of money and give you a little items I don't know cuz we're in the food is not 100% quality is always old also the personal they always give you attitude like I mean they always give you attitude when you're trying to get something or if when they get wrong and you ask him to give you what you order they give you attitude right away.< /Review>

I'd give it a ZERO if I could. From the time I pulled in until the time I was handed I drink through the first window, I waited 22 minutes. I finally got so frustrated because nothing that I honked my horn to get their attention. When they realize that all I had was a drink she handed it to me through the first window and I drove around the people that were still waiting. It was a horrible experience! This is definitely not a place to go if you're looking for fast food. I could have done better with a local diner.
On top of that it was the worst tasting sweet tea I had ever tasted. There was hardly any ice so it was warm, it was mostly water and the flavor was like a mixture of regular tea and watered down sweet tea.
I can honestly say this is the worst McDonald's I have ever driven through.

The food here has to be the worst I ever had. My big mac tasted like it was a Day old and the buns were hard as a brick. I didn't even try to ask for another one I just threw it away. Terrible.< /Review>

There were items on the menu they did not have, they  only 3 costumers in the lobby and it still took almost 30 mins. The people ordered before came back twice because items were left out the bag and/or order was wrong.My food was cold but I couldn't stay any longer. This is not the first time I had a bad experience at this location, I feel they need a new manager that can take care of business w/ employees, costumer service, and overall cleanliness. Lastly the young  lady that waited on me/us was very sweet and apologetic.
Thanks</Review>

This place needs a whole remodeling. The burger was rubbery and the out side was beyond filthy. My first tax paying J.O.B was McDonald's and I love giving positive feedback. The only positive energy was the lady who handed me my food.< /review>

The workers had attitudes, the food was nasty, not to mention it took 30 minutes to receive our order. I asked for a manager she took 10 mins to come out and she also had an attitude. I will report them to the corporate office and I won't be back ever again.

I told her exactly what I wanted but she still somehow took the wrong order. Not only that but when I told her this is not what I asked for she said yes it is instead of just saying okay let me fix the order. The people who work here need a better attitude towards their customers.< /review>

< Review>
It took about 40 minutes to get to the window to order the food.. ok... then it took another 10 or 15 to get the food. The lady was very nice, and took my order correctly... the one who served the food, is the one I have a problem  with. Ordered 2 large combos of big mac. Just to get one big mac and a fish fillet... I mean... (called to see what you can do about it, no answer) If you guys are understaffed you can hire me to do the orders CORRECTLY! Food for thought. And merry Christmas to everyone.</Review>

<Text>This is a nice location to go and grab a quick meal or snack. The lines are not usually that long and the restaurant itself is usually very clean and comfortable. We often go there. I definitely recommend this location to anyone who likes McDonald's. The prices of course are also very reasonable and the turnaround time is usually very fast.

They've completely missed my order a few times and I've waited there for around an hour and a half once for my order. I had gone the other day to get a burger and found a hair in it while I was eating it. I think they dropped the burger on the ground or something before giving it to me< /Text>

Currently it's drive-thru only and this is the second time that they forget items on my order. This time I decided to return to get my full meal as ordered. Unfortunately, I found that this would cost me more in time and frustration. I need a new franchise close to me...</Text>

This McDonald's is ridiculously slow. Poor customer service and they have turned fast food into extremely slow irritating food. People have been patronizing this McDonald's for decades and the service has only gotten worse. We deserve better treatment and service for our money! Stop going there until the service is improved.<//review>

This is the worst McDonald in food quality
My drive thru experience was awful.  Missing items,  no ketchup even though I asked for it. Anyway  ... Not a location to visit again.</Review>

< review>
I came at 5am, when they open, and the doors were still locked. I waited 2 minutes because I saw someone walking around then called the store and she let me in. She wasn't very friendly. I gave her a good morning and a smile. I don't remember if I got a good morning back, but definitely didn't get anything close to a smile. It is opening and the place is filthy, from the floor to the tables to the restroom. Whoever closed the night before didn't even wipe the tables, so it's a bit understandable why she is irritated or whatever, but lady I'm not the one who left it like that so give me the smile you are paid to give me. It's literally your job. Plus smiling releases hormones that make you feel better. Thanks.✌🏾💕😊< /review>

Usually the lane in this location is crazy long but we thought we got lucky today because the lane was short. We placed our order and drove to the window to pay. We waited for about 3 minutes to be acknowledged. A young lady with a yellow shirt possibly a manager was facing her back to the window and she talked to the cashier. It took for me to honk in order for her to open the window to take my payment. Not once did she say anything to us. Not a greet nor an apology. Just took my credit card and gave me my receipt. I drove to the next window where another young girl was. She gave me my food and I asked her if the lady in the yellow shirt was a manager and she said yes. I then asked her for her name and she has the nerve to say " I actually don't know her name I just got back but I'll ask". What??? How do you not know who the manager on duty is. I left. The service was extremely poor for no reason at all. I ordered 2 happy meals and a nd chicken. I think that's an easy order. Horrible service. The manager did not look happy. As a matter of fact she seemed unhappy. She chose to work retail and chose to be a manager.</Review>

(FRAUD ALERT 🚨) On Saturday night I went through the drive thru, I payed with my credit card and the employee “accidentally” forgot to return it. I called to tell them about it and he suggested for me to pick it up the following day. I insisted and told him I was on my way! I was able to recover it, but on the following day there was a transaction made of 150! Watch your cards people!</review>

I typically buy drinks only from McD's.  The app allows me to get a lot of deals if I decide buy food. However, I wish the quality of the food was healthier.< /Review>

Just ok. Service was very unorganized my order was messed up. The fries were burnt. Honestly it could've been better. The staff was overall and apologized before correcting the order. Just a basic mc Donald's if you're going through the drive thru make sure you double check the bag before driving away.<//review>

Long drive through, but always worth that unique McDonald's taste.  The Filet O Fish with the humongous glob of tartar sauce that slides out (NO matter how hard you try) all over your shirt while you're driving.  One of my favorites.   As a favorite,  I feel I shouldn't have to--wait for for it....< /review>

It took 30 minutes to get my food the frys where cold so I had them make me some more which took extra time. I do not recommend stopping at this McDonalds for any reason. They also didn't have all the ingredients for my sandwich<//Text>

The service was very poor. I order 5 deluxe, 3 coffees, 2 orange juices and 2 extra sauges and from that order we didn't got the coffee stirrups no forks no straws no ketup no syrup for pancakes and no extra sauces that I paid for. we had to go ask them for everything we need it.<//Review>

I wouldn't recommend McDonalds food to anyone for what should be obvious reasons . Stopping there was not my idea. Although, charging only a BUCK for a large soft drink was avery, very, very SMART move.  I'm sure millions go in to purchase a pop/soda & end up spending maybe on average say $5.00< /text>

<review>Do not go to this Mc Donald's!!! It took over 20mins to get my food! I went to use the rest room with my kids and there is a homeless man washing his underwear in the sink! Then as we were looking for a table, there were people sleeping in the seats! The place was dirty, but the workers were nice. Over-all I would recommend the you pass this eatery by!! And confronted by gang members as I was leaving with my kids!!</review>< Pictures>

Slow service because there is few people working there at 8 in the morning. Janitor was nice to let us into the restrooms that require a keycode. It was mostly empty in the dining area, the line and the parking lot. There was however a very long drive-thru line.< /text>

Thai McDonalds is disgusting. The bathrooms were horrific, with no toilet paper in the stalls (not even a toilet paper dispenser). And filthy tables. Additionally, there were individuals loitering outside cat-calling people walking by. Avoid if possible.</Text>

<Review>Orders are being handed out not in sequence the cashier was excellent but the assistant in the light blue shirt who did not have a name badge and wouldn't write down her name for me was not the nicest person for your establishment if it was up to me and I knew she was going to be there I would not show up to your establishment ther just letting you know but your cashier was very good in taking orders the handout you need a lot of help there thank you and have a blessed day</Review>< pics>

Don't ever come though the drive through. It takes so long to get your food. I'm waiting 30 mins and I can't even get out of here. I'm stuck in between cars. Please avoid this place and drive another 10 mins to the next McDonald's. Trust me it'll be a lot faster than ordering food here.< /Review>

This is by far the worst store in McDonald's. No one knows what is going on and the woman thatbwas iin charge had no clue what was going on. Sadly we will never chose this McDonald's again. We waited for 45 min for a 20 piece chicken nugget. Sorry to the very nice cashier who did everything she could but had no help from her coworkers or boss.</Review>

<review>It was the worst! I ordered my food from the machine I paid at 1:31pm at 2:00 i was just getting my food and i was quite upset everyone there was upset once i spoke to the manager she was no help they only had one person making the food, and from where I was standing they were only giving the food to the drive through customer.

So I received my food and the fries were cold and I ask for fresh food, so they took the cold fries and I waited again when CDC the manage gave me a new bag I thought the order was correct I made it to my car and I went to eat some of my fries and it was a small fries and it had a toy in the bag, so now I am so mad I just drove off and I called and let them know and the lady that answered she told lj e to bring my recipe and they would take care of it. DONT GO TO THE MAC DONALD ON CENTERY AND FIG THE WORST SERVICE. THE MADE MECRATE I DID NOT WANT TO GIVE THEM A STAR BUT IT WOULD NOT LET ME POST WITHOUT GIVENVTHEM ONE STAR.< /review>< Time>

Slow service, bad area after hours, not very safe to eat in, recommend drive through. the food is consistent for the most part. the staff is ok but can be better. getting in and out can be cumbersome. not the best place for a date or families. It's ideal for a quick stop and go only.< /text>

They remodeled this McDonald's and they tried but the neighborhood in the area is just to get all. The staff tries its best but the people who live in the area just trash this McDonald's so bad. Everytime I go there I never dine-in I take my food to go it's so bad in there.</review>

Wow only if this had a negative scale index because I would've given this particular McDonald's a negative -5 for the service and upkeep.. The food was cold and they had around 3 people passed out and drooling on the table 1 in the restroom some lady which my daughter could not use the restroom fire the entire visit.. Any ways this place needs help<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I usually order McDonalds through the drive thru, but the line was very long so I decided to order inside since there was no line. Now I see why everyone orders at the drive thru.

It smelled really bad inside (like a restroom) and the ceiling was leaking behind the food service line which makes me question the quality of the food. On top of that there were homeless people lingering around. One asked me for money TWICE. Once before I ordered and once afterwards. The cashier also didn't know what she was doing, she kept asking the manager for help making service slow.

I would not recommend this McDonalds AT ALL.< /text>< pics>

<review>Very bad service, Employees were so rude not only to me but to others. They had 5 workers 1 lady in the back cooking 1 young girl taking orders and 3 workers on one phone laughing. When my daughter finally got her meal her food was literally just toss to her.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< date>

Went there this morning around 0540 in the morning and the lady in drive thru  was extremely rude, had a nasty attitude n was frowning when i pull up to the window i honestly wanted to just leave n forget the order but is not the restaurants fault ... its ur employee she didn't give me a receipt.  She walked away b4 i asked for condiments i had 3 deluxe b fast n she didn't gave me no syrup  she gave me 2 ketchups . Her service was poor. I honestly didnt trust my food but i had to eat it.<//review>

I have never been to slower McDonald’s in my life ! All the staff sit back and gossip while we wait about 20 min for just one burger...
If you think about coming here don’t ! You’ll just waste your time in the line.</review>

Drive thru take 30 or more minutes.  Waiting inside take to long to get your food. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that in a rush...< /text>

You'll be attacked in the drive-through and management does nothing.  Unsafe.</review>

I ordered a unsweetened black tea. I was told to wait outside for my tea meanwhile it brewed... I waited well over 10min nearly 15min in the hot sun and got tired of waiting and drove home.< /Review>

<Text>The drive-through is so slow. Went at night and saw that the line was long but I figured it'll be moving. . . Nope. I was third to last and was in the same spot for like 15mins. It was ridiculous. I ended up backing up and leaving.</Text><UserId.>110521215305160400681</UserId.><Response>None< /Response>< Name>

This place is pathetic. We tried to get a late night meal but apparently it stops at 12am. As we tried to order some other drinks, and they claim that the soda machine is down. Epic fail.</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) It was a busy place, but the hamburger taste was very different. I hope you win that feeling only for me. I enjoy McDonnell Hamburger, it's not cool. Strangely, after eating McBug, I feel annoyed and tempered, so I don't eat well.

번잡하게 바쁜 곳이었는데 햄버그 맛이 영 별루 였어요. 저한테만 그런 느낌 이길 바랍니다. 맥도널 햄버그를 즐겨멋진 않아요. 이상하게도 맥버그 먹고나면 짜증나고 성질나는 기분을 왕왕 느껴서 잘 안먹는데 오랫만에 한전 먹어 벌까 하고 먹었더니 역시 다시는 안먹어도 되겠다고 결론 낸 거.< /text>< pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) The worst of the worst of the worst .. For not expressing myself in another way, slow talking employees, the cashier if there is nothing to charge stops and does not help, the line of people waiting in a hurry for their food to go to work, super pig parking, it seems that they designed it to be in a garbage dump, it smells bad, unusual toilets. Orrible image to be a food store

Lo peor de lo peor de lo peor.. Por no expresarme de otra forma, lentos empleados platicando, la cajera si no hay nada que cobrar se queda parada y no hace por ayudarte, la fila de gente esperando con prisa por su comida para ir al trabajo, estacionamiento super puerco, parece que lo diseñaron para estar en un basurero, huele mal, baños inusuales.
