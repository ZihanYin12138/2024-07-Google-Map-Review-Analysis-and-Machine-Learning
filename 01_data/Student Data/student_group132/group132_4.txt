Delicious sandwiches!! And super friendly staff!!  I really like their turkey and cheese sandwich! Also, I called and asked for a special request - marbled rye - to surprise my boyfriend since he couldn’t find any. They graciously sold me a loaf and sides of pastrami so we could make the sandwiches later that evening after their closing time. It made him very happy and I’m grateful for this awesome shop! 🙏💕< /Text>

<text>My favorite place to get a terrific sandwich. Ventura Sandwich is a well oiled machine. They are fast and friendly and consistent. The turkey club is so good I’ve never had anything else. My mom says the Jr Reuben is very good too. I may never know.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Updated for 2020: I have to take away two stars, if you see the photo of my sandwich below this was the way it was made back in the day. Back when the owners were a little different, I believe there may have been two of them I'm not sure. And the staff there was different. Ever since I noticed one of the owners and some of the staff gone I couldn't help but to see the the sandwiches weren't as good as they were before. And I attribute this mostly down to proper portions to make a sandwich delicious. The reuben sandwich you see in the photo is not what you'll get anymore, now you will get one so overladen with meat that it just might as well be a meat sandwich, corned beef is a salty meat, no need to over do it. Granted it still tasted good, but over a year ago visiting on a weekly basis they weren't good, they were fantastic. I probably hit the place up 4 more times in the last year and it's just not what it used to be. Proper portions make all the difference.</Text><Date>1606782209847<//Date><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfND0A1T7snDeqI5jyWVHZMrEVf-LfcdXX6Oal=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics></record>

<review>They make my most favorite sandwich ever.  I get the veggie on sourdough + add turkey.  I crave it like all the time!  Great staff too - kind people always making me feel welcome.  Thank you, VSC.  Will continue to spread the word about your awesomeness. 🥪< /review>< Time>

If u wanna spend 8-9 dollars on a sandwich with practically no meat in it, and on stale bread, then this is the place for you! Never again! Dont trust all the good reviews.< /text>

XLNT Sandwiches, all varieties tried (turkey, tuna, corned beef, pastrami).  Sides are generous and tasty.  Beef and turkey sandwiches are HUGE!  Usually have not finished a whole sandwich in one meal.  Fast service< /Text>

Best sandwiches in Ventura!  Hands down!  And, a gluten free bread option for wheat/celiac sufferers.  Their meats are Boar's Head, also gluten free, and are of the highest quality with wonderful taste!  Lov'em.<//Text>

<Text>This is the best sandwich shop! They only use Boar's Head meat, cheese and bread.  Many options.  You can modify your sandwiches. You can make a sandwich into a salad.  They have soup, kid sandwiches,  chips and a variety of beverages. I've been going there since they have opened and I have never been disappointed.  The staff is also amazing and friendly.</Text>< userid>

<text>Honestly the best sandwiches ever!  I highly recommend the Turkey Club on either sourdough, ciabatta or a white roll! My husband has tried quite a few of their sandwiches (Aztec Roast Beef, Pastrami, Reuben, Corned Beef, and of course the Heart Attack ) and has loved all of them!  The customer service quality tends to vary depending on the day but overall, I highly recommend checking them out!! It's best to place a phone order as they do get a bit busy and rightfully so :)</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Amazing sandwich shop in Ventura. Make sure to try the turkey club on sourdough!

Parking can be a little tricky be so close to the hospital but with the new wing open it’s much better.

Inside has only a few tables but you might be able to sit outside.

Food is priced reasonably and tasty! Give it a try.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The place was packed so that was a good sign. The Sandwich Board had a lot of choices of bread but by the time I got there they only had two choices of bread left. So I got a bread that I really didn't want. I wanted sliced Sour Dough but I got a White Roll. I really loved that they use Boars Head Deli products! Boars Head is one of the BEST Deli products out there!! I got Turkey, Roast Beef and Munster Cheese. Even though I got a White Roll and not Sour Dough the Sandwich was good because turns out they they do give you somewhat a good amount of Meat in there Sandwiches, so I was really happy about that! The only thing that I wasn't to Crazy about was that my Sandwich was Really "Dry"! They put VARY LITTLE amount of Mayo, Deli Mustard and Italian Dressing on my Sandwich. Don't know if that's how they normally make them or if that's just how mine came out? I Really like my sandwiches with just a bit extra more Mayo and Mustard on my sandwiches. So that's why I gave them 4 Star's out of 5.</review>

Delicious Sandwiches! Fresh produce, lots of bread choices, and you can make any sandwich into a salad. Just wish they were open on Sundays!</Review>

I would of gave 5 stars, but there was a lot of construction going on. So... Everything was Very Good, and just like the last person that posted; I had the turkey sandwich on sourdough.  👍👍 Service was Good, Food was Great.< /Review>

Great place for sandwiches. Not anything like a chain fast food sandwich shop, they make proper tasty sandwiches with quality Boars Head deli meats. One of the best choices for sandwiches in the county. The Heart Attack sandwich isn't listed on the normal menu, but is well worth trying if you like a big hearty sandwich.< /Text>

I'll take this place over subway any day. Its different. I always get mine with squaw bread. Even their potato salad is pretty good. Try it. Same building as Ventura Spaghetti Company I believe but on the other side facing the hospital.</Text>

Great place to stop in for a snack! Just passing through, looked up a few good sandwich places and this place topped the list. As soon as you walk in you can smell that their meats are high quality. We ordered the hot Italian to split. It definitely did not disappoint. They brought it to us on separate plates, having even cut it in half without us asking! Good vibes all around!< /Review>

I needed a break from being with my daughter at the hospital, and hadn’t eaten in 24 hours. The cafeteria which is usually decent wasn’t good enough, I wanted a sandwich. Walking across the parking lot n there was a sign. The  Ventura Sandwich Company! I ordered the Aztec Roast Beef sandwich and chit chatted with the counter guy, sorry forgot his name. It was a damn good sandwich!! The counter guy was very nice n kool! He asked if I liked clam chowder, I said I loved it! He returned with a free half a bowl sample, to my surprise, it was also very delicious!  It was the perfect combo! Don’t be misguided by the outside, give it a shot!  It’s a nice little shop with character. I will be back, and with friends!< /Text>

Hot pastrami was good, but at $14 ea it's pretty pricey. Add chips and a soda will run close to $20.  If you're a well paid health care worker, the cost is no big deal. For us other plain employed, it is a big deal.<//text>

< Review>
We recently discovered this place and have been back a couple of times. They have nice selection of hot and cold sandwiches and salads... my husband has tried the turkey with avocado, the pastrami and hot roast beef. I've had the cold roast beef all three visits, but on different breads. Everything we've tried has been freshly prepared, tasty and service is fast. Their food is a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. When we want a good deli sandwich again, Ventura Sandwich Company will get the call.</Review>

Really great sandwiches, one of the best in town I'd say. Could use a bit of better communication between the register and the people making the food, they've made my order differently than how I've asked for it a couple times, but we're always happy to fix it. Definitely earned the 5 stars<//review>

Great tasting sandwiches. I had the Reuben sandwich and it was so delish. Loved it. My wife had the Turkey club and loved it. Parking is horrible. Small dining in area. Most people order and take it home.< /Review>

<review>This place is the ultimate rip-off. I went there today based on all of the good reviews this place has. I paid 9 bucks and change for their Aztec Roast Beef sandwich. What I got was a slab of beard, maybe 2 ozs of roast beef (and that's being generous), some unripened tomato, and some other condiments. Total rip-off (if I could give less than 1 star, I certainly would have).</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The pastrami is good (Boar's head), but the amount of mustard, pickles, and kraut made it taste more like a pickle/mustard sandwich than pastrami. I'll try it again, but easy on everything but the pastrami!</review>

Best Pastrami Sandwich in town.  I'm a big fan of the Pastrami at Togo's but this 805 sandwich is incredible.  They don't cheat you on the meat, that's for sure.  Very friendly workers.< /review>

This is the best best best nail salon in Santa Clara. Amy does incredible nails, they are perfect EVERY time. She was also able to spot that I was a runner and relieved pressure in my big toe (and explained how she did it!).
Amy has also been rehabilitating my nails and they are growing super healthy and look great. Can't speak enough about how much I recommend this place.
The salon itself is absolutely gorgeous, SUPER clean, spotless and shiny and they have tons of colors to choose from. Like, tons.
I have to have neutral nails for nursing school and have endless neutrals to choose from.< /text>

Wanted to get my nails done on a whim and they squeezed me in last minute on a late Saturday afternoon. Atmosphere is super cute, warm wood tones, lots of trailing vines and plants, pink accents. Amy did my nails. She was sweet and professional which I love, I just want to zone out and not chat when I get my nails done. Was very pleased with everything overall. I'll definitely be back!</Review>

<Review>This is my second time coming to Tammy, and I couldn't be happier. I called ahead to make sure she had time for a walk in for powder nails. She immediately recognized me when I walked in, despite only being there once before. Everyone there was cheery, even the other two women who were getting their nails done. Tammy took her time and was thorough in everything she did including the filing, application, and keratin treatment. I liked that she checked her work one last time after she had me wash my hands. The salon itself was very clean and sanitary as they open a new set of sterile tools for each client. It was also modern and open, a midweek sanctuary. I will be returning again next time!</Review><GmapID>0x808fca1344f0de43:0xd1cef571c8b0c287< /GmapID><resp>{'time': 1607366453490, 'text': 'Thank you very much for using our services, see you next time !'}</resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>I immediately walked in and was welcomed. I was going in for two nail repairs and a fill in. Helen had an appointment, but she was willing to do my fill in until her next appointment got there. Helen repaired two of my nails and did my fill and Amy polished my nails. I felt right at home. Winndy was there as well and I loved her energy. They usually do mostly appointments, but they were willing to work me in and I truly appreciated that. I'll definitely be back!<//text>< Pictures>

I'm so glad I found Color Me Nail because it's my favorite nail salon by far! I had such a great experience here! The customer service here is always very pleasant! The staff is great from beginning to end. Tammy did such an awesome job! She was gentle, very accommodating, kind, and talented. She is also very quick and it's virtually painless. Every time I walk out of this salon I have a huge smile on my face. They always take great care of me.  Won't go anywhere else!<//review>

I've been looking for a new nail place and I came across this cute spot in Santa Clara. It was a very nice & relaxing atmosphere. Staff was very attentive and pleasant. Amy is my nail technician and she is absolutely great! I would always challenge her with nail designs I find online and she always exceeded my expectation. I will most definitely be going back.<//Text>

Seriously, if you live in Santa Clara, go see them. Helen (the owner) and her family are great! It isn't cheap, but it's so worth it. There are an endless supply of colors, great service and just the best staff (clearly I prefer Amy!), but Winndy, and Tammy are also rockstars. You can't go wrong! I miss you guys!!!</text>

I've bounced around to different nail salons because I have very high expectations for my nails. Color Me Nail has been the only salon that's been CONSISTENTLY been amazing. Today I had Helen and I will never go to another technician. She pays attention to small details, I don't have a single flaw or wish she did another better. I will recommend her and the salon to everyone I know!< /Text>

<review>I continue to be very satisfied with the friendliness, cleanliness, and how my nails look. Winndy did my nails and did a great job. She took her time and did a phenomenal job. She does an amazing job on my nails and does it always with a smile. Everyone was super nice, checking on me repeatedly. I made an apt and was in and out in an hour. I will be back!</review>< Pictures>

Today was my first time at Color Me Nail and I got to say I was blown away! I absolutely love my nails but that is not the only reason why I'm writing this review.

There are plenty of salons that do great nails but Color Me Nail really has great employees! They are caring, nice, well-versed in customer service, and they make you feel special.

I will most definitely, be back! Thank you for everything!<//review>

<Review>I've been going to this Polished location for over a year now. I go every two weeks and I've seen 3 or 4 different technicians. They're all wonderful and they take such great care of their guests. I typically see Winndy or Helen, but truly you can't go wrong with anyone there. I recommend it to everyone I know. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my mani/pedi!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><UserId.>102388727603418725693</UserId.>< Rate>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Color Me Nail is officially my new nail spot. My technician Tammy was super nice, talented, & meticulous. She asked me if she could cut my nails and if I was ok with the shape of my nails! She even asked me if she could cut my cuticles. Usually other nail salons are really rough with cuticles but she was so gentle. I have never had anyone ask me at a nail salon if they could cut my cuticles so I'm super impressed. Im so amazed by her artistic skills.<//text><response>{'time': 1607366303048, 'text': 'Thank you very much for using our services, see you next time !'}</response></record></dataset><record>

Temps taken and handwashing at arrival. Masks worn and social distancing enforced.
The staff was very engaging and made sure you were comfortable.
The pedi was very thorough, I got the midway option and very relaxing. The price point was perfect.

This place is popular. Since they had a very specific 5-minute-spaced interval of appointments. I made great time and got out of there on time. The staff was very attentive and efficient. Super friendly staff that goes above and beyond for each of their clients.
Thanks for the great service during a super busy time!</text>

Following health hygiene protocols, waiver is up front with temp checks. Seats have a glass fiber between nailtech and client, alternate seating availability. Sent home with my buffer and nail file :) other materials are soaked in germicide/ sanitized. Place is clean including BR. Even got a bottled water. Walk ins are welcome - Best to call for appt to ensure no rushing of service and overcrowding. New fave place!</Review>

This my go to nail salon now. I used to go to a nail salon. They would always make my cuticle bleed. So I found this place and I love it. I have been here a lot in the last year and have been impressed every time. I have gotten dip nails and acrylic nails. Both have been great quality and the workers are always so sweet.
I will definitely recommend and come back to this place.<//review>

Wow.....just wow! I had the best experience last night at Color Me Nails!! I got a full set with shellac and a new design that the owner was really excited about (cat eye made with magnetic polish) and it turned out so good!! It never hurt, she was efficient, and the whole process felt great!!  The decor was nice, they give you a little water bottle.
My first experience was amazing and I plan on coming back again and again!</review>

Excellent customer service sets this humble nail joint apart. I made a reservation on Yelp, which received a response almost immediately. When we got there, the location had a 10 minute wait, so we were ushered to the sister salon for our time slot to be honored. Quick, thorough manicure with nice touches like tea, shoulder massage, and kind technicians. Would highly recommend!</Review>

I've been going to color me nail for almost ten years. Even when I moved up the peninsula I hated every salon I tried up there. I only get pedicures and haven't asked for artwork in years, but it's always the best value for my money. It's changed management a couple of times but it's mostly the same friendly, caring women that work there. They no longer offer personal tool sets with your name like they used to but I'm okay with that. It's always clean and they are usually careful to show you opening newly sanitized tools in front of you. The massage chairs are mostly fat friendly, as I'm a size 26 with 62" hips and they fit me perfectly, is say if you're closer to a 32 it might be tight. I've never encountered any day hating remarks or negative body comments here in general. Sometimes other clients may carry these conversations but it's pretty rare. They play a pleasant mix of music from classical, easy listening, pop and edm...seriously, it's great because you never know what will come on. I'm a music nerd so this is great for me. I always call ahead but rarely make appointments. They do have very busy times but want to help everyone so you may have to wait if you don't phone ahead. A quick call and like today I called at 3:30 wanting a 4pm slot and she said they're busy can I come at 5. Worked out perfectly for me and I was out by 6 sharp. They carry OPI and Essie for regular polishes. They carry all of the major gel/shellack brands, like a ton! They do good gel manicures. They have different levels of pedicures and manicures. I love the Queen pedicure wish includes a 15 minute massage (they set a timer and show you), scrub, mint mud mask, brief hot Stone massage, hit towel wrap and a good creamy lotion,  hot parifin wax for you feel and callous softener. It's so relaxing and right now only $35. You can pay with cards but they generally prefer cash and definitely tip in cash!</text>

Color Nails did a great job on my mani/pedi! I came in for the first time today and got the express spa pedicure.
I was serviced right away, and the atmosphere was very friendly. Everyone in the shop was very polite and enthusiastic, which I appreciated. As for the quality of my nails, I'm really pleased. I'll definitely be returning.</text>

Loved this nail salon! I got a gel pedicure done, while my cousin got a gel mani/pedi. These ladies were the absolute sweetest. My nails are a little grown out now, but the paint still looks good.
I will always go back!<//Text>

My nails came out great! Helen was super nice and always asked if I was alright. She also asked if my nails were how I wanted them throughout the duration that I was getting them done. I suggest calling and making an appointment since the salon does get packed. Also make sure you request the right service since the technicians all specialize in certain ones! Will be coming back in the future!</text>

I went to Color Me Nail last Tuesday, and Winndy did my gel manicure and pedicure. She did a phenomenal job! She took her time and was very precise, did not rush through the massage. It has been 11 days so far and my nails still look just as they were when I left. I am particular when it comes to getting paint in the cuticles, and she didn't get any in them, so I was very pleased. She's a perfectionist, and if its not right she fixes it before she moves on to the next step. Thanks so much for the bad a $$$ manicure Winndy! My friends all notice too =)</review>

"Hands down, this is the best nail place . The decor and cleanliness is immaculate. They have pedicure stations so it is great if a group is going. I was able to get an appointment for 4 people at the same time with no problem.

Their basic manicure/pedicure prices are competitive with other nail salons (but the experience is so much better), and they have upgraded manicures and pedicures. They have little menus that explain what each one is, which I love - very clear pricing and services.

Quality is second to none. my go-to nail salon! Free Wi-Fi too. They don't have TVs, which I like, but is good to know if you do like that."💗< /text>

May I just say that my SNS manicure and peppermint aroma pedicure were absolutely amazing!!! I did not have an appointment and dared go on a Friday evening after work. I was greeted right away. My wait time was not long considering there were persons who had standing appointments. Winndy was amazing on my pedicure and Tammy did an excellent job on my SNS manicure. They both took their time with my nails and that means a lot to me. I will definitely be back.</Text>

Very rustic, family owned charming place. Dog friendly and kid friendly. We did not have time to take the trail down to the river. Apparently you can picnic there. Definitely going back. The wines were great too!< /Text>

<text>We arrived the day after xmas. Our gracious host Tom greeted us as we came in and escorted us to our site overlooking the river under magnificent valley oaks. In addition to their various batches of wine, balsamic vinegar and olive oil from neighboring farms were available in the tasting room. We purchased their Zinjo, a spicey red as well as a Sauvignon Blanc. The Zinjo was delicious. We're waiting to open the white wine this evening.

The estate has a well maintained trail that weaves among the hundreds of acres of vines and the riparian landscape. In one small meadow, we sat a spell in Adirondack chairs under the canopy, a welcome if too brief respite from all covid worries.

The estate is less than 15 minutes from historic downtown Lodi and it's small shops and restaurants.

Visit Heritage Oak. You won't regret a single minute.

Having just come from Napa it was really refreshing to visit a working man's winery which has wine that is just as good as Napa without all of the tourists and high prices. Tom is a welcoming host and a great vintner.< /review>

<Text>We happen to be there for wine and chocolate festival today and the vibe of the wine employee was not nice.... the older man that was pouring the wine literally ignore us because we werent white.. you can see how they treat people differently cause we were latinas, Filipina and African American.. we wont go back again!< /Text>< pictures>

I’ve know for many years both of the men who were pouring behind the bar yesterday, and your comments really surprise me.  The older guy (balding) tends to get into conversations with people and focus on that at the exclusion of other things.  I’ll speak to him. The other thing I will point out is that we had almost 300 people coming through here and everyone who was working, got rather frazzled by the day’s end.  If you are in the area again, come back and ask for me or my wife (who, btw, is a Latina) and we will make it up to you.\nTom Hoffman - Owner'}<//response><gmapID>0x809a9e6b2968c393:0xe30e68e4d7b532e<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful winery. Delicious wines. Easy walk with your glass of wine down to the cool river. Definitely worth the drive off of Hwy 88.< /Text>

My wife and I went here to get pictures taken of us on the property. Their place is beautiful, and they invite you to take a walk around. Afterwards we got to taste their wine, and man they have some of the best wine in Lodi. Definitely coming back here again soon.< /text>

Fantastic aesthetic! It feels like you’re walking into an art gallery. Even better than the atmosphere however was the costumer service. Stephen is really knowledgeable about the products and is patient in sharing his know-how in a way that even nugget newbies will understand. He really goes out of his way and it just seems to be the culture of the company. A little pricey but hey it’s California what do you expect.

Make sure to bring cash!<//text>

The owner of this gorgeous shop is not interested in being a cannabis salesman, there are plenty of those all over the Monterey Peninsula. Valentia is such a kind soul on a mission to teach everyone how they can benefit from using cannabis medicinally. She is a patient herself, and uses cannabis because it provides her with a great deal of relief with her MS. There are so many methods for dosing besides smoking, my new favorite are sublingual tinctures.

I have had a medical card for years, but always considered myself more of a recreational user until she created a unique directive for me. She recommended reading material which has changed my entire attitude about this miracle herb! I always loved cannabis but feel so empowered knowing the science behind it. With the CBD rich products she recommended, I feel like I am in the best physical shape of my life. Two weeks into my new dosage, I was able to run ten miles which I have never done before.

Wether you are an experienced user or new to cannabis, the staff here is both friendly and knowledgable. As an added bonus, it is gorgeous inside!< /text>

<text>JEN knows what she's doing!! I brought my friend visiting for the month into the shop and she was nervous to try cannabis again because of a panic attack she suffered. Jen listened carefully, asked lots of questions and guided us to the PERFECT combination and amount of products. She gave us a couple edible drinks and told us to go watch the sunset with them and let me you, we haven't laughed and had so much fun in the longest time. My friend told me it felt so good to laugh hard like that again and it nearly made her cry to release all that joy and to feel so light again. We can't wait to go back and see Jen again, we completely trust her instincts!< /text>< pics>

What a blessing. I took my mother in, she was welcomed and really taken care of! There were comfortable chairs for her to sit in while a staff member brought products to her. A Dr and a nurse were on staff to answer all of her questions and give her knowledge about products. They even wrote on the boxes, reminding her when to take the things she purchased.
This store is also just gorgeous! The weekly specials are awesome, and the prices are better than most on the peninsula.</Review>

< review>
I typically don’t write reviews however about 18 months ago I was traveling with a work colleague and his girlfriend. I was complaining about my back pain and joints after playing a round of golf. They asked if I’ve ever tried CBD for pain, I was quite skeptical but tried it and it literally changed how I manage pain. I’ve been playing competitive golf for 32 years and it has taken a toll on my joints and back. I can categorically say without CBD I would not be able to swing a club or play competitive golf. I would like to personally thank my work colleague but more then him is his girlfriend Valentia Valentine who has a vast knowledge and understanding of all the CBD products. Golf is more enjoyable without back or joint pain. Lastly, if you’re experiencing pain I would strongly recommend taking the time to spend 10 minutes with Valentia and she will change your view about how to manage pain with CBD.<//review>

Synchronicity holistic is a refined dispensary serving the highest quality products on the market. Samantha is beyond knowledgeable and can offer information regarding the use, effects, and benefits of medical marijuana as well as the process of cultivation, and laws that might be useful to review. Her confident demeanor, patience, and interpersonal skills are a great addition when trying to navigate the products and retain all of the information being offered. I really appreciate the different methods of use available to people with various needs/afflictions and highly recommend this place-the staff, space, and the products are top notch!< /Review>

<text>This is a is a beautiful boutique dispensary with high end product. The owner, Valentia is not a cannabis salesperson but a dispenser of knowledge about cannabis products and the cause and effects. Not only is she knowledgeable but the entire staff is also very well informed.

i had surgery and I found i was having trouble sleeping and and I had on going  pain issues.  Within a matter of several days Valentia was able to provide substantial pain relief and I was sleeping soundly through out the night. She intuitively knew what to adjust , eliminate and fine tune  all within a very short period of time.

i am so thankful for Valentia and her entire staff and feel very welcome, when I need to return for additional assistance!<//text></record>

This isn't your normal dispensary. Coming from other dispensaries, this is a fresh, new and inviting concept. Woman owned and run gives you an immediate calm feeling as each patient educator welcomes you with a nurturing and friendly energy. As soon as you walk in the door. This place reminds me of the high end establishments in LA and San Fransisco, with high quality products and an open and inviting layout, the beautiful design is just the cherry on top. Thankful they are trying to carry products not all dispensaries in this area have, giving the community even more to try!<//Text>

I had such a great experience here. With no prior knowledge of anything in the cannabis industry, I had the best lady, Jen help me! She pointed out amazing supplements to use for my anxiety and inflammation issues. I went with the Level THCV pills, topical cream, and Cann drinks. I was really impressed with Jens customer service skills and how cheerful and kind she was. I will definitely be coming back! Hopefully while Jen is there to help me.< /review>

< review>
Went there on Sunday hoping to have the same great experience I had in July. Unfortunately One of the main Sales persons was not wearing a Mask.
After waiting 5 mins. at the entrance I asked another young woman working there why there was someone working in the store without  a mask. I even asked if perhaps the person already had Covid. The young woman just shrugged and finally said she didn't know.  Masks are legally required indoors. Bc. I am a senior, I had to leave immediately.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>This is a wellness center with medical grade products and nurses and pharmacists on staff. Since the owner has MS for the past 30 years, she is dedicated to helping others transform their lives in the same way that cannabis helped transfer hers. The establishment is beautiful, clean, organized, and caters to individuals who are looking to improve their health through cannabis. One day soon, this place will be regarded as one of the top dispensaries in the US due to its upscale quality and dedication to patients. The one star reviews are coming from the recreational competitor who is located in the same shopping center.... it's a shame that people feel so threatened by competition that they feel the need to drag down others.< /Text>< Pictures>

Though in close proximity to other cannabis centers, each and everyone one of us in this industry has a very special talent we offer to every patient we service. We look forward to coming together for the health and wellness of this very versitile community in the most unique way of LOVE and COMPASSION.

This dispensary is beautiful and inviting for everyone thanks to the warm staff. The set up makes everything so approachable and the employees are incredibly knowledgeable. This women operated business is all about educating clients and helping people. The staff curates an array of items very intentionally. They know their products inside and out- just ask about anything and they are happy to share their knowledge. The employees are passionate about what they do and it really shows in the service. I learned a lot while having a very enjoyable shopping experience. They never rushed me and it felt so warm, unlike some other dispensaries I’ve visited that have felt a little sketchy. They’ve got products I haven’t seen anywhere else and an education area. This is unlike any other dispensary I’ve been to- definitely don’t miss it!</review>

This elegant and extraordinary of all Dispensaries, located near the Barnyard, is truly the Tiffany of Weed.  Staffed with mindful, medical professionals, this is not your run-of-the-mill pot stops.  With a vast array of educational tools at your disposal, a wide base of administering products  and a true in-house branding where the intention of Cannabis is strictly seen as a healing tool, this dispensary provides a fresh look into the amazing and eye opening world of Plant medicine.    Why go anywhere else?</review>

<Time>1576604360687</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>This is hands down the nicest dispensary I have ever been to. I'm not sure what the negative reviews are about, the staff is extremely friendly and they bring a level of knowledge to their product that is rarely seen at other dispensaries. The facility is beyond luxurious and  located in a central part of town. They have every type of product you could want with a wide variety in brands, very excited  Synchronicity Holistic is now open for business.

I am disappointed about the negative reviews, it seems like stakeholders from other dispensaries are trying to disparage this business. I would think that regardless of the competitive landscape that competitors would have more respect for one another. It seems that many of these negative reviews are baseless or over exaggerated. Regardless, 5 out of 5 for SH.<//text>< pictures>

Not only is this establishment aesthetically engaging, and a joy to shop in, but it also carries only high quality products and is clearly a standout in terms of compassionate care and healing…

I have been to many many dispensaries including strictly medical dispensaries, and this is the first time I truly felt taken care of in a comprehensive holistic way.  Valentia and her staff were incredibly attentive and kind and went above and beyond, answering all my concerns with brilliant suggestions that I’m just loving.  They even helped my wife get her daily cbd regimen on track in a significant way.  Synchronicity Holistic is truly a bastion in an ocean of confusion.  It reminds me of Sweet Flower in Los Angeles in terms of quality, but even better…  I cannot say enough about how impressed I am with this operation.< /Text>

{'time': 1576460643416, 'text': 'The owner of Synchronicity Holistic was the first on the peninsula to apply for a permit to operate a brick-and-mortar dispensary. After suffering from MS for 29 years, and discovering the health benefits of cannabis, she started her activism with local municipalities in 2010 as a major influencer in the cannabis space. This paved the trails for growers before crops became legal. She gained wide support from the broader community, which gave her the confidence to make a major building purchase in Carmel Rancho in 2015.\nOther nearby dispensary owners had been turned down at the Mid Valley shopping center and in Big Sur prior to pursuing a lease for recreational use in 2018, knowing that SH had already purchased the location.\nSynchronicity was carefully designed to personally serve medical patients in a positive and professional environment. It is very different than others in the area, in that Synchronicity is staffed with certified medical and educational professionals. We hope people will appreciate the good things we are doing to provide cannabis education and suggestions for healthier alternatives to heavy, chemically manufactured OTC and prescription drugs.'}< /resp>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>How did they manage to put a dispensary about a hundred steps from the existing dispensary despite the 1500 foot rule?
The black building with pink and white flowers and topiaries resembles a funeral home.  To top it off, fake birds resembling vultures circle the building!
Update: The response from the owner did not mention that the owner was apparently no friend to the cannabis community until personal need became an issue.  Before that, she was famous for constantly subjecting her employees to drug testing.
How many companies in the area refuse to work for her?  More than a few.
Also, a quick look at the 19 five star ratings shows that all but a few of the writers seldom, if ever, contributed to Google Reviews before reviewing this business.
And furthermore, the response reads like it was written for the owner, not by the owner.  When I wrote a harsh review of the nearby dispensary a couple of years ago, the response showed genuine concern, and was actually from the owners.  They went to considerable lengths to address my concerns, and their response was kind.</Review></record>

I was extremely impressed by the level of professionalism from the moment I walked in the door. Over a period of years I have been prescribed a variety of medications and my goals was to find alternatives with fewer side effects the educators were very knowledgeable and the pharmacist and the pharmacist was readily available to provide input.. I learned so much. I learned so much on my first visit it was very comfortable and returning to provide my input on the significant decrease in the level of pain I’ve had experience for many years. I encourage anyone in a similar situation to stop in and you will not be disappointed.< /Text>

I interviewed for this shop before it opened and was told that they were looking for older candidates (30+). They said they were going for an “upscale vibe” for the posh locale. No thanks. I’m all for dispensary competition but this dispensary needed to be in Monterey, not next to Big Sur Cannabotanicals.<//text>

Nestled on the corner among second hand stores and unassuming small businesses, Synchronicity Holistic might surprise the average passerby. The storefront balances the appearance of a luxury boutique with a welcoming and unpretentious environment created by an experienced team of staff members. Especially to those seeking information and education on the health benefits of CBD products, this establishment elevates patient care and discretion to a level unparalleled by the competition. As for those with an inclination for recreational products, they will be ecstatic to find a finely curated selection of premium products including everything from flower to concentrates. This store has something to offer everyone. And regardless of what products are purchased or knowledge is learned, everyone will walk away having experienced the marriage of top notch professionalism and a vision for the future of the cannabis industry.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Remarkably my experience with Synchronicity has been a total believe in their products, and it’s Positive result afterwards. Plus we were very persistent to find the right one to our chronic discomfort,  inflammation and pain.
My mother, Mary Rosa, 92 years old, used Papa Barkley 3:1 ( 3 CBD 1 THC) 3 small pots, and myself 2 Herself, being Italian, Calabrese, and Testa Dura ( Hard Head ), was reporting on a daily basis it’s results, then myself, Max Rosa doing the same.
Then, my breakthrough happens when in a act of little frustration reported to Valentia Valentine our dilemma.
She immediately recommended the 1:3 ( 1 THC 3 CBD ), we just reversed the Holystic remedies.
To our success, exactly 3 days later, we both reported to each other completely healed and mobile without any signs of inflammation neither pain.
Don’t give up on you first attempt, these Holystic remedies really work, just consult Valentia, her pharmacist, or nurse. Valentia staff is extremely friendly, and knowledgeable of their new craft.

< review>
For me, the experience was like finding the holy grail of dispensaries. I’ve been searching for someone knowledgeable to educate me on how to use cannabis for back pain and anxiety. I had many many questions about how CBD and THC work together, how fast they work, how long they work, and what on earth my dose should be. Valentia took a lot of time with me and answered all my questions in great detail. She helped me find products that would address my health concerns without making me feel stoned because I’m in my 50’s and (sadly) sensitive to feeling “funny.”I haven’t had success with smoking, vaping or edibles, so she introduced me to tinctures and gel caps. I’m very cautious about what I ingest so the fact that all her products have been thoroughly researched and vetted was of crucial importance. So far I’ve made impressive progress and inadvertently solved another tormenting issue: rls.
If you need detailed guidance in navigating the marijuana phenom, this is the place to go. Also should mention I found it impressive that they asked me to report in on how the products are working for me because they really seem to want to keep track of what’s effective for people.
Decor is not my first priority, but as a creative person I find the vibe enchanting, especially the adorable candy display. I hope this review helps someone out there because I’ve been searching for a long time and finally found a place that could give solid advice.</review>

I have to say this place is amazing.  I have had several back operations and I purchased some releaf balm when I am sore. I don't take anything other than tylenol but this has made my back feel much better so I don't even have to take tylenol anymore.  Yaaa. I recommend visiting this place for your natural needs even my doctor would rather me us this the to much oth stuff. The staff was very helpful and guided me to the right stuff.

I have chronic pain from years of issues stemming from neck surgeries, knee damage and recently tendonitis due to a car accident.  I have used holistic and conventional medicine.  I prefer to use holistic medicine most of the time and trust in those who are professionals and often seek their guidance when trying a new product.  I went to Synchronicity Holistic seeking just that after reading and hearing all the hype about this new dispensary that had opened.  I was really hoping for some relief in my pain and wanted some information and to purchase some new topical creams.  The first person that helped me could not answer basic questions such as "how many doses in a 30 ML bottle?" without going to some back room while leaving me at the counter to ask the owner Valencia (I know this because she told me she was asking her).  When coming back she still had no idea how many doses I would get out of 30ml bottle of topical pain cream with a $50 price tag it to boot!  I have tried other products and really wanted to know more about alternatives.  While she was scrabbling another woman (still not the owner) came over to try and help and literally put the lotion on her own hand had and told me it felt like 1ml so I probably could get 30 doses out of it.  Now this may sound trivial to most but when you are needing to dose 3x a day this could get costly.  Basic questions un answered.  I also wanted to know what the carrier oil was as I don't use palm oil and needed to know before making a costly purchase.  Again, no clue and she had to go to the back to ask the owner again.  She returned to tell me it was all THC/CBD oil (all lotions and creams have some sort of carrier oil such as coconut, sesame, palm, etc) and I actually ended up showing her the ingredients that it was coconut oil.  Basic questions unanswered and I haven't  even dove into the specifics about the dose being a 1:1 or 1:2.  I did not have the time to keep waiting for this woman to run back and forth to the owner to answer my questions.  I went to this new dispensary because I have read in the Weekly and Pine Cone that they had all top medical professionals.  I can tell you personally this was not the case and do not waste your time.  The people who are working here may have medical credentials but have no business in the holistic field of medicine.<//Text>

It is our intention to be able to enhance the patient experience by taking the mystery out of selecting the right products.  What you should’ve heard from my patient educators was.... “these are our two top favorites what the dose was and best bang for your buck”. It is with heartfelt sincerity that we were not capable of taking the mystery out of this purchase for you. If you would reconsider coming back to the store I will give you my favorite topical that will give you the most “bang for your buck”.\n\nPS. You mentioned a brand that did not work for you, not my favorite either.\n\nWarmly, Valentia'}< /Response>

The owner talked to me and started me on CBD sublingual. I explained I was here to buy a pack of joints, but after talking she suggested I try cbd too. I heard it works but I don't like spending money on anything without thc; I got a deal so I tried it. Two days after dosing myself 3x day I felt more relaxed and in less pain--I know this isn't everyones experience but I have lots of inflammation issues.

As a nice added bonus, I accidentally started smoking less weed. Is it because of the cbd? I have no idea. But I am a bong rips for breakfast kind of gal which I've WILLINGLY stopped doing! what?! I am a believer thank you Valentina 💚</Text>

< Review>
They deleted all their old one star reviews, so i thought i would put this back here. And they implied i need help for anxiety in their response to this review (before they changed their response), so add unprofessional to everything else i said.

Checked this new place out the other day while on the other side if the hill.   Don’t usually leave reviews for places.

However, all these other 5 star reviewers with identical writing styles and brand new accounts with no other reviews on a first name basis with the owner convinced me to add my opinion.

Feels like this place is run by someone trained in snake-oil and recently made the move to cannabis. This place has been open for about a week or so and people are already claiming to run ten miles and receive these in depth life changing regiments. Its been open a week.

The selection is meh. And not a good variety of cannabis either. Some staples you can find anywhere, but otherwise nothing special. They will sure tell you its special though, how unparalleled their gummies are...

Super awkward all around. Fake.< /Review>

This is dispensary is so ostentatious! I felt so uncomfortable in here. And to make things worse the young lady that helped me was so nervous and had zero knowledge about the products I was inquiring about. I walked out empty handed and I will not be back.<//text>

Ocean Cafe is a small little Cafe that has breakfast and lunch items, plus lots of healthy drinks, shakes and smootheis. The staff here is really friendly, pricing is good on the food but a little much on the beverages, and they have a few seats inside and outside. Parking here can get tough since the parking lot is quite small but there's plenty of street parking around. Croissant breakfast sandwiches are where it's at here for sure.< /Review>

Visiting this Coffee shop was a great pleasure. I relax and feel comfortable with their assistance. I was not mistaken about choosing this Coffee shop to chill out. It was really hard to find such a qualified place with my taste. I am deeply impressed by how they handled their customer correctly with no hassles at all.</review>

Great spot and excellent acai. Looks unassuming from the outside but cute and clean indoors. Friendly staff. There is some outdoor seating set up too which is nice< /Text>

My wife and I have been on a search for the greatest açai bowl in San Diego and I really feel like this is the one. Everyone that works there is so nice, and all their ingredients are fresh and delicious. Got my punch card so I can reap the benefits of always coming back. Can’t recommend it enough< /Text>

Best açaí bowl I've had. New favorite place in San Diego.  Great cappuccino(oat milk, yeah I'm one of those) as well. Drip coffee was okay. Space was clean and bright and staff was super friendly.</Text>

The staff was incredibly rude after taking 30 minutes to start my order. Then when my pickup was ready, she never even told me. It sat on the counter for my smoothie to get hot. The sandwiches were not worth this kind of attitude on a Sunday morning.</review>

Service with a smile doesn't exist here and the prices are pretty high. It felt like I was a burden on the employee even though my order was simple and straight from the menu. Coffee and acai bowl were good though.<//text>

Lovely little cafe with a great ambience / cute and comfy decor. My car was next door at the auto shop the whole day and I was stranded, and the guy at the cafe allowed me to work here all day on my laptop over juice and tea, and was such a sweetheart. Saw some amazing acai bowls that I might try next time if I stop by here again!<//text>

One of very few *real* acai places I've found since moving to southern CA. The acai base is *just* blended acai, as it should be. Not strawberries and bananas blended with acai juice, like a lot of place do. The people who are always there (I assume the owners of the establishment) are really friendly and fast. Highly recommend this place if you like acai bowls.</text>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>Really nice guy!
I asked if the açaí was organic,  he said it's "all natural"...
Ergo, not organic.
Light on the fruit, very basic.
Claimed to be a 100% Brazilian authentic açaí recipe, I do not doubt this... however, I am fairly confident this means acai with little more than water, frozen.  No offense, but the texture is watery and the flavor is almost non existent.
That being said, I have no doubt that pure acái has a higher orac level than say a blend that includes guar gum banana etc...
But texture and flavor is lost... and of course, this is not organic, so you get whatever pesticides, herbicides and fungicides that are legal, in Brazil.
Again, really nice guy, i would like to support, if maybe he added more fruit on top to make up for the low flavor of the açaí. Organic would be great too!< /review>< pics>

{'time': 1529440943971, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, Brian. We actually dont add water to our açaí. The taste of our açaí is definitely different because yes, it is organic and it is also pure, so no weird stuff added and of course, no sorbet! . The fruit is actually blended with the organic and pure acaí, which means that has much more fruit than most of the açaí out there. Authentic Brazilian Recipe :)'}< /Resp>

If I could give -5 stars I would. DON’T WASTE your time here. I made a reservation for a trailer with a confirmation number and everything, drove 35 mins to get it and when I got there they had NO IDEA what I was talking about and then said that the only trailer they had was being requested by the previous renters for another day so I was out of luck. They took my card information and everything. & EVERY SINGLE REPRESENTATIVE was completely rude and hesitant to help me in any way.<//text>

<review>Good service. Kept  a hold on my deposit forever and had no problem taking the total mount after I turned in the truck. Their call center service sucks, but local shop was really good.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c47c9dbaa4d597:0x5572eb47d2273b61</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Be careful with these guys. I have rented equipment from uhaul many times with no problem. The last time I had to keep the truck a few extra days and upon return my bill was astronomical. I disputed the bill and now it is even higher! They advertise less than 20 bucks a day but for 8 days I am supposed to pay 475 dollars? ....oh yeah, a list of ridiculous fees.

Rip off.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c47c9dbaa4d597:0x5572eb47d2273b61<//GmapID></record>

<text>We have been working with Alex Rodriquez for the last month trying to organize packing and shipping for my sister to downsize and move to Illinois.   Because of Dr's appointments, our schedule has been chaotic to say the very least.   Alex has been understanding,  supportive and more helpful than I could have ever anticipated. He and the other staff members are always respectful, helpful and courteous.  Thank you!   Charlie and Jill Brewton<//text>< Pics>

<review>This place is a joke I got a 1979 Jeep Renegade 350v8 with the original stock Jeep hitch on the back and they say I can't rent a tow dolly from them to tow a Meyers manx VW fiberglass dune buggy 30 miles., I've rented from other U-Hauls many times with my Jeep and never had a problem they won't even work with you these guys are idiots! I would have gave him a zero rating but I can't so I gave him one star< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c47c9dbaa4d597:0x5572eb47d2273b61<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They want to raise the rent, Security is very poor next to none, Employees don't seem to know anything about the fees and bait and switch between them and their corporate office about the fees. This place really needs an overhaul for knowledgeable and helpful employees  and their security needs it as well.<//review>

<Review>two days ago was our first time we came to that fine restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the generous service, with the first-rate  dishes and fine drinks and with the decent charge. We will definitely visit there again.</Review>< pics>

Good taste,  cheap eats. The AC needs to be turned up, but as far as the grub, its pretty good. A bit of clutter from cases of soda, water but its Clean.
I recommend to try it if you're in Montebello.<//Review>

Good value overall. Couple small caveats. The potatoes in the chicken curry were excessively soft and become mashed just trying to fork one. Excellent wonton soup. 10 cents for fortune cookies. Fountain pop is expensive as they charge for refills. I'd rate the buffet food 3-4 starts (this v includes the chicken curry) , but observing other people's plates, and my  wonton soup, the made to order items are easily 5 stars, for a good price.</Review>

Food is okay. Fair price. The only gripe I have is when I ordered the 3 item combo to go. The put all the items in the same single box. All the sauces got mixed up and was not tasty anymore.<//review>

<user_name>Suzanne Gregory< /user_name><Time>1611242502966<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Ordered take out from here on Christmas Eve. The food was impeccable! I so wish I could have a nice dine-in meal here, because when I went in to pick up, the ambience was really lovely and the staff person on deck was super duper nice. Some day! In the meantime, the food stands up well to take away service (and very neatly plated in takeout boxes!), so I will keep ordering from here. I want to try everything on the menu!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwArFJ2CVikhTro4EyByQBpAnEoWZV3jhCx4Ex=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRY7lHmVt2Gy6RJUvlgeeyKGfgEXiw1DNSOtvZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnxoXnCAdGaXXrFjqDno4zo2KOKTp1Os9sVLhr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHavdgedk0CzoWqtblKbSBFQGZu1R_9iOTIbqv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2xCAHLzpqybxUUvmMI1Cwlw8Nzof1BaGTS_4Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFFVx4QYLVWjI9NgYh6jmOIptK1oKabdt5fu7N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIiaMoAVANSAbxkYm99cSpFft-xKHm3kylbYVE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeD5MMTMe-gTDI-AkXkn94RLCboIikFcLLKB78=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJWazqiFeGnlcwE6HRLV5mpq5TOi40RGSroo-v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-YUxcLqLQ3ZbKuKG4d1V0Hr8PvEpk_CfwPFml=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmbkKGDBgKMwLv7nb6wxv99e8x59zgEvqMziKZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuMn0Z7t5yJET0jHf8TGShLRxOt9yW1Z8haGaj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDdzj0X4OyuKxCtOjsTJpBv_b0PKCDr39S13g0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMu0waUgW2So9XTv1U3a_ojYciFghHHKdtGUxsF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOR6CLmGAQKVvtpTa7T-0irUOE5J1mQ0EJipxzo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

Amazing food and excellent service. What more could you ask for? Extremely surprised to find a restaurant of this quality a few miles from my home in Vallejo. This is easily on par with some of the best restaurants you’ll find in Napa. Hidden in a small shopping complex off the 29 is not where you would expect to find food of this caliber. What they did with the appetizers was both creative and delightful. Asparagus with a fried hard boiled egg, brussels sprouts with a sweet vinaigrette of some type, steak and chicken were delicious. Went back a few days later to try the burger. It did not disappoint.<//Review>

Wife and I had an excellent dinner at the outdoor tables. The service was very friendly. The appitizers were great. We had the lamb and steak for dinner, the seasoning flavors were wonderful and the both were cooked perfectly. Dessert was lovely. We are definitely going to have to make a return.</review>

<rate>5</rate><text>Where to even begin with this amazing restaurant!
My husband and I were visiting from Colorado for just a weekend getaway. After a few glasses of AMAZING Pinots, we got talking to our waitress about the local wineries in the area. She was not only so sweet, attentive and wonderful to us, we felt like we had been old friends for years.
Next, the food. We have never tried Nepal food before so we were a little hesitant! DONT BE. We did not have a single thing (including dessert) that we didn’t like. The chef is incredible. My husband is a very picky steak eater and he had no complaints about his New York Strip.
This restaurant is the real deal- the staff is the foundation of it. Thank you Dawa for a wonderful first day in California! (We also already made a reservation to come back tomorrow....)</text>< pics>

Amazing place! Cannot say enough about the food, it is incredible! This is a hidden gem with some of the best food I have had. I travel frequently with work and have been all over and this is one of my favorite places. I was served by the owner each time I went, he is very amiable and attentive. I tried everything: momos, steak, salmon, chicken, all amazing. Worth every penny and more.< /text>

<review>Came to Laso for a birthday dinner from out of town. The  experience was an incredible conclusion to a long day of wine tasting and touring the NAPA area. The Brussels sprouts were heavenly, the salmon was cooked to perfection - perfect mix of tender and crunchy- truly bursting with flavor. The ambience and service were also excellent. Would definitely recommend.</review>< Time>

<Review>Wow, just wow. We have lived in Am Can for 20 years now. Several nice places to eat, but when we want something different or extra good, we usually head up to Napa. Laso is a little set back from Hwy. 29, so we didn't notice it, and hadn't bothered to google places to eat near home in years, as we thought we knew them all. Well, we didn't. Laso opened a little over a year ago, and we were really missing out. So when we finally discovered them on a google search when we were looking for new food to try, we were so happy with absolutely everything. The food was so flavorful, out of this world! We had the beet salad, the squash curry soup, the lamb shank, the eggplant and the Momo dumplings. Everything was absolutely outstanding. We split a slice of  super cheesecake too. Service was fantastic and friendly. Eat local, can't recommend this place enough!!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><user_id>103495817499568653601< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Incredible. Couldn’t have a better experience. The owners are very gracious and run a top tier dining establishment. Saying the food is awesome is underselling and doesn’t do it justice. Do yourself a favor and order the Half Chicken. I smiled after every bite!<//Review>

Great place to dine for a special occasion with your loved one. Waiter is friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The food we ordered were magnificent and served with style. My only suggestion is that they should include the appetizer menu even on lunch hours. Reservation is highly recommended for this place is getting popular.< /review>

An amazing gem to be added to American Canyon. From the beginning you know you are going to be in good hands. Service was 10/10 food was 10/10 and the overall atmosphere was 10/10. A perfect restaraunt to host a small get together or intimate date for 2. Portion are adequate for full size plates, and the small bites are perfect to share amongst the table. Will definately be going back here again!</review>

<text>Wonderful new place in American Canyon!!!  First I was blown away by the decor!!! Loved loved loved it!! I was treated to a glass of sparkling as I walked in by a very handsome man who happen to be the owner. Placed a order to go but didn’t want to leave because the staff and chef were so attentive to all my needs. Staff was very well educated on full menu ,very impressed with every detail that was put into this place. Food is beautifully presented, excellent taste
Would I return? ABSOLUTELY thinking of having a party in there our door area later this month!! Five stars ⭐️

Both were just amazing.
We enjoyed lunch so much that we plan on going for dinner tomorrow.
Joshua and Ming were very friendly and attentive.

We’re all a bunch of foodies... and we cannot rave enough about this restaurant!!! If I could give it more stars, I definitely would!! The whole experience was out of this world!! The food was so fresh and so so good! By far, some of the best food we have all had in a very very long time!! Thank you Laso!! ❤️🙌🏽<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1580511524321, 'text': 'HI  Andrea!

The two brothers from Nepal who started this restaurant really have something going. This is the best restaurant in American Canyon. The food is spectacular. Really great place. Great ambiance. Definitely recommend.<//text>

Well I’m really Glad that their are People like you who Care and People like you make this world beautiful 🙏 . Keep up your good Spirit, always keep spreading love and make this world a better place to live .. always looking forward to serve you more. TEAM LASO'}</resp><text>Let me first start that this place is nothing short of amazing.  I am from out of town and not only did the hotel recommend this restaurant but insisted... so I went and ...I am glad that I did. You see I am not from here and from the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed . Not only was the owner friendly but accommodating.  Truly something that was welcoming. Well.... I proceeded to meet an adorable couple who was celebrating her birthday. I wanted to ‘Pay it forward’. And So I did. Well when the bill came, I was shocked and ticked off that the bill for this cute little couple was over $1200!!!!  Panic struck and I was left with  just my heart beating a million times a minute and I simply wasn’t familiar with what was at hand. So....I questioned it, raising my voice that it was absurd of the amount......yah...you get the rest.  Well it turns out I did not have my #*\• readers on so the suggested tip looked like it was in the thousands but reality it wasn’t. Soooooo my long drawn out story is this.....THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!!  The owner not only was sympathetic but deserved a medal for even engaging in a farsighted baboon. And if you are the couple that received this gratis dinner.... please do me the solid and recommend this restaurant for you and your friends, coworkers, family. And if you are happening to come across this review....Go get some food from this place.  You will NOT regret it. The setting is magical. CHEERS!  BTW. Treat people with kindness. .<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>One of the only upscale restaurants in the area! My fiancé and I are from Portland, OR and were staying in American Canyon. We wanted to find a unique and quality place for dinner so we came to Laso. The food was great! So flavorful! I had the scallops and he had the lamb shank. Our server was very friendly too! Great place.< /text>< username>

I recently moved here anaheim,so I went to this bank,closer to my house to update my personal information,and to get a new card because I change my last name,so they ended up sending my new card to my old adress,and never updated anything I had to call,because it was a month already that hadn't received my new card,make sure they do it correctly idont know what's going on in there.</Review>

Staff is professional & polite..yes including the accounts dept.! Been coming here for yrs & now I know why there's long lines!! I know this place has a wonderful manager, because it definitely reflects on her staff! I've emailed her a while back on the outstanding customer service & politeness. She got back to me promptly & was very attentive. Will keep coming back here, no matter how far I am!👍<//Review>

Its funny cause this building used to be a pizza place. Great for after sporting events.

Its a bank now for Wells Fargo. Kind of busy, But good service. Friendly tellers.
Just amusing seeing how different it looks in here.< /review>

This place is always packed with long lines on Saturday. Depending on the teller you could have good or bad service.  But you are helped once you get up to a teller.</review>

My family and I banked with Wells Fargo for several years, very good relationship up until now, I was treated very rudely at this branch when I inquired into several hundred dollars missing from my savings account. The missing funds was transfered with out my concent to pay for a CC. I never gave them consent to do. They argue with me they're customer forcing me to believe I signed up for a overdraft protection service, I never authorized on any of my accounts. They basically stole close to $300 out of my savings account. When I brought this too the attention of the bank manager Daniel , he was very rude to me and actually kicked me out of the bank I hold my $. Because of this I will close my accounts and take my $$ elsewhere where it's protected by my bank not stolen.< /review>

<Text>Really good food i had the Mexican ham and eggs with toast. Cost i think was around 7 or 8 dollars. Had the chili the other day and it smelled good, but it lacked something the taste was different from the smell . Had the pastrami just yesterday and it was really good the pastrami was very tender and easy to chew not full of fat. I hear the international omelette is a hit, i have yet to try it.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I had a #2 Breakfast special with sunny side up eggs and mix of 2 sausages and a strip of bacon along with coffee. It was good. Nothing special about the place. It just serves what’s expected of it. However, if you compare it to what IHOP offers, it’s a better deal. Enjoy your breakfast while waiting for Foreign Auto Body opens.<//text>

< Review>
The burger was delicious and the fries were good....HOWEVER, my girl got those items while I got the "homemade" clam chowder. Never EVER have i had something that was this nasty. It was completely FLAVORLESS! No salt, the meat was VERY fatty and it tasted like water. Someone needs to be retrained on what homemade means because that ain't it, smh. Definitely a pass< /Review>

Great place for burgers and more. The drive thru was quick, the service friendly, and the food delicious. Everything a great burger place should be.
And the burger special for only $5.99 for a huge burger, fries and a drink is awesome!</text>

The service was fast and friendly and I’ve never been more satisfied with a breakfast meal. Thank you :)</Text>< response>

Lol I love authentic Mexican Food but, again lol I'm kinda into Yorgo's crunchy pre formed taco shells and crispy lettuce, sweet ripe tomatoes & unseasoned meat ...it works I enjoy them. Top them off with Heinz Taco sauce (ask for it). Yummy Yummy<//text>

This place has just about everything that could meet the demands of the most hungry and those wanting a variety. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner are all covered in both quality and quantity. Having ate there over 100 times, I have never been disappointed.<//Text>

Great place to have a burger and some chili fries. Put ketchup on the burgers and chili fries. They have been open since I was like 5 years old and that is in the 1980's era. Bring back the arcade machines please ,which were there when I was young. Oh, my childhood flashbacks..... still a bomb place to eat in the Gardena area.<//text>

Never disappoints! Classic charbroiled burgers, chili fries and onion rings! Breakfast is always great too, especially if you want to take the kids out but not spend a lot. Burger, fries and a fountain drink for only $3.99, nowhere else in the South Bay. Not to mention the owners and staff are always polite. Thank you Yorgos staff :D< /review>

Pretty average southern California burger joint. They do offer a variety of things to eat beyond just burgers, to include breakfast and full dinner options. Also, the prices are very reasonable. You can get a burger, fries and a drink for $3.99. Overall, solid but not spectacular.</review>

I have been going to Yorgo's for over 20 years!  I love their gyros, pastrami, chicken souvlaki, and fried zucchini. In fact, I'm going to have the rest of my pastrami sandwich for breakfast.< /Text>

<Text>Paid too much for turkey burger combo for it not to be flavorful, but if I ate meat could of gotten 2 burger combos for what I paid for. Fries were blah no salt and mushy.

Easy going burgers without the long wait from the red and white chain across the street. The $5 Burger combo is a decent value which includes those thick French fries along with a drink.<//text>

Passing by looking for a  quick lunch  and saw the 3.99 burger special  and stopped   to give it a try. It's  a small  burger and small fries, but hey...it was very tasty and the perfect  size I was looking  for. I recommend it and I will  come  back to try something  else  from the big menu!<//review>

I do not recommend ordering the number 1 and the number 12 and really nothing was good the pancakes seemed plastic the meat had no flavor to be shorter it is possible to say that the only good thing was the soda and not the coffee that seemed pure hot water the service of the boy who took the order not very nice they have a lot to improve is definitely the first and last time I eat in this place< /text>

Followed my nose - just driving by and couldn’t believe how good it smelled! Pulled over and tried their Colossal Burger, chili-cheese fries and drink - AMAZING!!

The pastrami was spot-on! Juicy and flavorful! The chili-fries had just the right taste - not sweet or spicy. Just the right flavor. Wow!!</Review>

<Text>Good food but staff is so/so... I came late at night one time, was waiting in the drive through, was hungry, people were still inside but they refused to serve me, maybe they were closed but they definitely could have still served me some food... If I were in their shoes I would have served some food. Also, I witnessed another incident which makes me doubt this places credibility, it makes me sad because their food is pretty good...</Text></record></dataset><record>

A cool little mom and pop shop. Great prices, good food and super clean. My favorite are the breakfast tacos. Lupe is very nice and she always has a big smile. If your in the neighborhood stop by and try the breakfast tacos.

Definitely a neighborhood favorite.  Fast and good food quality.  Simple service, down to earth sincerity.  Try their new item "spicy chicken sandwich" - so fresh and crunchy!<//review>

< review>
I was just driving by this burger joint.  Then my friend said they had good burgers.  What's a GOOD burger? I thought... So instead of asking him. I drove in.
They had a full menu over the counter, i could see cars pull by their drive-thru, they didn't seem to be waiting to long... Star!  I had to ask the lady for the house specialty, she looked confused so i just went with a burger combo.
We ordered two of the same, when she rang us up the total was around $8bucks and change, cool.  As I was about to reach for my wallet to pay for my order.  She walked away...  It was the price for both combo's!... Boom! Star!  It didnt take long when she called our number. Two average sized burgers and pair of steaming hot fries, we already had our drinks.
Ok.. the fries were piping hot! Fresh out the fryer.  Burgers has noticeably fresh veggies, and a freshly cook patty I took a bite... Hmmmm.  I said "this is a good! Burger"...Star!  All in all there's nothing bad about this place, also nothing super.  That's it.

My friend wouldnt stop raving about the fountain drinks, he swore their syrup mix for the soda was unlike no other place in L.A....  IDK
So just in case he hits this post some day...Star!
...just cause you wouldn't stop talking about it Doug Stewart.<//review>

<text>Yorgos, I say this because I love you.. The prices are too high. All of them.

If you lowered all of your prices (except drinks) by $1.00 and put a sign by the street saying "All prices lowered!", you will get so many more customers that you'll be making more money immediately, and those customers will be happy too.

I love your food, but the prices are scaring me away, you're across the street from Wendy's and they make some pretty high quality fast food for even less money than you do. You must compete with their prices.

Maybe add a value menu too. (I never see one at the drive thru). I hope you give this advice a try, and I'm sure that I, and many others, will be happy eating at Yorgos again.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b565c1cce723:0x732a465599567015<//Gmap_id></record>

Quality of food is average and the place lacks a pleasant atmosphere. Number one problem is the prices of the food. Prices are very high!!
I understand that this is a growing epidemic amoungst the food industry, however with that said , this place is on the higher end with prices. Next time I am hungry and near this area, this will be the last place that will come to mind. Easily forgettable.< /text>

Was hungru so I decided to stop by ended up paying $8.50 for a burrito that's edible in 4 bites. I should have gone to jack in the box. Customer service was good though< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Fast food quality!
But if you like junk and chili bowls, you might be addicted!
My personal preference is 4 stars!
