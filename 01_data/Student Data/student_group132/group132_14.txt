< Review>
So to start I do not leave reviews but I will and HAVE TO for this place. This is by far the cleanest Public Storage I’ve EVER had s storage with and the friendliest staff. Who without a doubt will go out of the way to help you. I just moved in two nights ago and the best part of this place is low traffic, high security, super clean and accessible. I couldn’t ask for a better place to store my things for a couple of months.<//Review>

<review>I have used many storage locations for business, but
the staff at Public Storage in Solana Beach is the most professional. Justine is the hardest working manager I have ever met, in any business.
Justine is on top of all aspects of running that location. I have received calls from Justine to tell me my lock was not locked ( my fault) and followed up on billing questions immediately.
While transporting items in and out of my unit, Justine and Josh are always working around the property keeping it clean and maintained.
Just a really impressive management team.
I recommend this location highly.</review>< Pics>

We were just at our Public Storage unit and needed some help from the office.  Justine, the manager, helped us and was terrific.  Highly recommend this storage place and their fabulous manager, Justine.</Text>

When I walked back down stairs he told me he would only refund me $25 of the $50 that I had paid less than 5 minutes before.
I didn't get anything from them, but they feel the need to steal $25 from a non-customer in the midst of a pandemic.
He lied to try to get a unit rented and when I said no thank you that won't do, they stole from me. 0/10 would not recommend.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
Terrible experience renting here. When I rented I was never informed that rent increases would happen. I had two rent increases happen in less then a year. The property is run down with building staircases missing steps and has many safety hazards. Units have no light inside of them and are pitch dark. The exit gate has also broken down multiple times and seems to keep breaking down repeatedly. I contacted the upper management, but nothing seems to have been done about fixing the property the whole time I rented. I mentioned my rent increases to upper management and they did not give me a rent decrease. This is despite me paying a higher price than the price of a bigger storage unit than mine after rent increases went through.

They told me my only option was I would have to transfer all my items into another unit to get a unit of a cheaper price. Horrible business practice. The office staff is good, but the property itself and the company is abysmal. They do not seem to care about their properties or customers. Typical company that cares only about money and puts customers second. This company would rather get a new customer than maintain good loyal customers who follow the rules and pay on time. Absolutely backwards way to run a business.</review>

I was helping my cousin with moving and getting a storage unit, and we first stopped to buy some boxes. The prices were very good and Stephanie was so very helpful and friendly, we will definitely be going back to Public Storage and recommending this business to family and friends. It was also very clean, which is a plus.</review>

Public Storage is great. The people who work here Gary and Mike are great. Both of them take good care of the customers here and are professional. Property has a lot of great outdoor drive up units available for rent. Units are available for access 7 days a week. You will need insurance to rent here though. So check on your insurance and make sure it covers storage.<//Review>

<text>Got stuck helping my friend move today & we couldn’t find a decent priced storage for the size unit she wanted on our third stop we arrived at this place. Not only did they have great prices but Stephanie the gal who worked there was super helpful when it came to my friends pickiness ( like I said third stop!) not only was she patient she was accommodating to our needs we got great unit & the day is finally over.</text>< rate>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>My girlfriend rented here while we move. Mike made the rental process easy. 10 minutes and we had the unit rented. Other storage places they make it complicated but it was simple to rent here. One thing I like is unlike my other storage previously rented at you don't have to give a month ahead notice to move your stuff out. You can move it out as soon as you're ready.<//review>< Pics>

Storage is a Storage, not much to say. The same as any other storages in SD. But the staff were amazing. Stephanie was her name I do believe.. And she was more than helpful. I wasn't having a good day with my storage hunting until I came here!!! Stephanie helped me get a storage that was fit jus for me & was so patient with me even though I gave her a hard time at first but moments later. She helped me figure everything out and now I have a place to put all my treasures in!!! Thanks Public Storage! keep up the good work!< /review>

This Public Storage is really good. My boyfriend rented here and I was glad we ended up storing here. The property is clean and the staff is very nice. I always see the new manager Michael cleaning around the property. The other staff Gary and Chris are also really great too. Being able to store outdoors is very nice. Michael, Gary and Chris go above and beyond with customer service here.</Text>

She even got up when I came in and greeted me .I have severe anxiety so those little things mean a lot, not to mention having to deal with moving in the first place  . I would definitely recommend this  location to Any and all friends and family , and ask for Stephanie!<//Review>< Pics>

A friend of mine rented here so we could store both of our items in storage. I was originally not sure about this company as I randomly saw it while driving and decided to see what it was like. Mike an employee gave terrific customer service he asked about what we were storing and he recommended items to help protect our belongings. He not only found us a space that fits our items well, but he also got us a good deal. Mike got us a unit that was bigger then the one we reserved and also for a lower price than the unit we reserved! If you need help go to Mike he is great!</Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>After going to TWO other Public storage locations that were mysteriously closed, I rolled up to PS in Solana beach to find Brittany, the only staff member, leaving to go on her lunch break.  After she saw the defeated look on my face, Brittany turned around, put her lunch on hold, and came back in to the office so I could buy some boxes.  Most people wouldn't have turned around, or if they did, would've done it begrudgingly. However, Brittany assisted me with a smile and gave me amazing customer service.  I cant tell you the difference it makes when someone goes out of their way to be cool to you-  Brittany did, and she seriously made my day.   Because of Brittany's amazing service, this location now has a loyal customer.<//Text><resp>None<//resp>< Rate>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Mike made the rental process quick and easy. He answered my questions during the rental and was helpful. The facility has indoor and outdoor units. Disabled people do need to be careful though because the upstairs units are only accessible by stairs. There is no elevators for customers to get upstairs. If you have trouble with walking because of a disability you may need to rent a ground floor space which are a little more expensive because of the convenience.<//review>< pics>

I've been renting here awhile and the property is great for storage. I was looking to transfer spaces. I spoke with Michael and he helped me transfer to a new space for a great price! Michael made the process quick  and easy! As said this place is great for storage I like how some of the units are outside and you have the drive up convenience.<//Text>

<text>Rented here and the employee Michael was helpful. He helped me save money by helping me figure out what size space I needed for storing my items as I am moving. After discussing what I was moving and looking at units Mike helped me realize I could fit my items in a smaller unit that was closer to the entrance. Thanks Mike.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Manager Michael from the office was very helpful and helped me out. I handle the financial part of the company I work for and there was a lot of problems with making payments and transferring our rental units. Michael helped us get everything sorted with the business account and spaces. Great manager with good customer service I appreciate him being real. A lot of people our company does business with seem phony but Michael cared about my issue and did a good job in helping me out. Very smart manager and excellent customer service.< /Text><time>1552947193039<//time>< rating>

Their prices are reasonable and you can return purchases for a full refund (not the case at other chains). I’ve only had to return items I wasn’t going to use, nothing that wasn’t good quality.

I’ve never had a bad service experience there but I’d like to give special mention to Ashley for her patience and positivity.< /text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>Used this place for a few months after I moved to California.  The place is well kept and the staff is friendly.  They offer steep discounts to get you in and the monthly rates aren't too bad for the coast.  I was a bit annoyed by the lighting.  The light switch on one side of my building didn't work so I had to walk all the way to the other side.  The elevator also got stuck.  Try to avoid upper floors if you are coming and going a lot.  I also got screwed into paying for a full month when I tried to close out on the 1st of the month.  Make sure you get out before the end of the month.  They will prorate your first month to get you in but will NOT prorate your last month.  You also have to pay $20 for the locks that you will never use again.  Why can't I rent some..... Overall a decent experience and may come back if I was in a tough spot.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dc092dd492ccfb:0x7fa35ae4e30fc0e7<//GmapID></record>

I was here a few days ago and one of the managers Michael was getting ready to leave to go to lunch and noticed me as I pulled into the parking lot. He asked if I needed help and when I said yes he got out of his car and reopened the office to help me make a payment. He sacrificed some of his time on lunch to help me make a payment. Outstanding customer service! It is very rare to come across selfless people who care for others like this! Michael deserves a raise.< /review>

This place is awesome. We were moving out last minute from San Diego and we’re looking for a place to store our apartment furniture. They made a late appointment and totally accommodated our tardiness. Vida was amazing and got us all set up quickly! Definitely going to refer this location to our friends when they need a place to store their stuff.< /review>

Call the actual stores instead of the call center. Employees on location are way more knowledgeable and can make sense of your questions. Thank you to Chris specifically for being so helpful.<//review>

Ms. Vida was super helpful when I came in to open up a new unit. I was super stressed out and worried about it but she set me up with the perfect unit and it was such an easy process. She’s so sweet and super positive it was a pleasure to meet her! Will certainly stop in to say hi every time I come to visit my unit! Thank you so much Vida!!!< /Review>

The service at this place was horrible. We spoke to the manager on the phone and we went all the way out of our way drove 30 miles just for the manager to tell us that he could not help us when we then asked if he knew of any other people who can help us she shrugged us off and was very rude.the only reason I gave this place one star is because it wouldn't allow me to give it to zero.<//Text>

Mrs. Vida, has by far the best  customer skills that I have ever came across at a Public Storage Facility! Me and my staff are always welcomed with such a heart warming smile. Very Very dedicated to solving any problems or concerns or questions if we ever so have them. I wish more people took pride in there job as she portrays on a daily basis. Even in the minimum time we get to see her it makes a significant difference to me and my Crew thanks for everything!!!!#1😎</review>

This property has a lot of great outdoor spaces. My stepson rented here a few weeks back and I am helping him move some items as he's in the middle of a move. The staff manager who works here Michael I always see cleaning around the buildings. He also helped me out when I got stuck outside the gate and didn't know how to put the code into the keypad properly. I had forgotten to press the star before I typed the numbers in for the code. If Michael hadn't helped me I would have been stuck for a long time trying to figure out the gate system. Thank you to Michael for helping me out you are a life saver.</Text>

I never saw any bugs or mice. Always a plus. I had a 10 x 20, first floor inside unit. Access is easy and there always seemed to be a cart to use. Ground floor units are a great value with the 12' high ceilings. Only wish there was parking inside so I didn't feel like I was blocking units during load in and out, but I only needed to move once in a year, so not a big deal. Probably not the cheapest, but I'd recommend it if you are storing things you value.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Office staff (Kit) was very friendly and professional. Kit answered all our questions and showed us two units so we could choose.  We rented a unit the same day.  Location is very clean albeit older than the location we were used to on Miramar Road.  The Solana Beach location does not have climate control and the doors to the (interior) unit are not metal and do not roll up.  It is more like a home closet (swing) door.  Nevertheless, we are happy with the location and recommend it.</Review>

Never do reviews but I have to say that Vida the manager of Solana Beach Public Storage is a great asset to your company.  She has a positive attitude and exceeded my expectations.  I went in just for some information and walked out with a unit and enough supplies to pack everything and then some. Thank you for the wonderful service.

This place rocks!  The front desk women are extremely helpful and friendly, especially when dealing with people who are moving and usually very stressed.  The place is open earlier and later than other storage units in the area, and is also less expensive.

The online capabilities to manage your account are also amazingly simple to use.  Well done!<//text>

After I thought the nightmare was over - they put the $91 charge back on my account with no warning until a collection agency called me. Why would i have ever logged back into my account once I was closed and moved out and ALREADY REFUNDED FOR MY LAST MONTH.

They didn't even warn me they decided to undo the refund for the nightmare until the collection agency called...< /review>

Juno and Juana are great. Super easy painless sign-up and mine wasn't usual. I'm a real estate agent and needed to get a unit for a client who is out of town.  they handled the whole thing and I was in and out of there in a flash.  I've used their storage personally as well and find it to be a nice location for storage.  keep up the good work ladies!</Review>

This is the first time I'm having to pack and move basically by myself and I stopped in to get a bunch of boxes. I had NO idea how many or what sizes I needed, but Kit was able to make the process so easy. She asked me questions about what I was packing and was incredibly helpful in suggesting sizes and other things that I will need.</Text>

<Review>Public Storage is terrible. My girlfriend rented a unit here. We got 3 rent increases in 1 year. The units also only have light in the hallway so when you are inside the unit there is no light and you have to use a flashlight. Place is old and rundown all the units are made with drywall so they are not very secure. I am glad we are not renting here anymore.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I give this location very high marks.The manager, Juana and all her team where very helpful and professional. They made the moving experience much easier than I had expected.
I was provided with all the tools and necessary information to help in the process of storing my car and possessions.

Juana made my move in experience so smooth.
It's refreshing to meet such a polite professional
helping us during the transition times in our lives!
Because of her, I will recommend this business
every chance I get. Thanks Juana.< /Text>

The units also only have light in the hallway so when you are inside the unit there is no light and you have to use a flashlight.

<review>When renting, the weekend check-in person was friendly and helpful, but within 1 month of moving in, our unit was burglarized.  When we discovered it, the weekday staff person didn't seem to want to be bothered, she said there's no camera or entry log data and handed us a post-it with the number of the manager and said we should call him.  Three tries, left VMs, no response.  I would steer clear of this business.<//review>< Pictures>

<username>Peter Dunbar</username><Text>Finally was abel to give her a review we tried and tried these phones and systems are not that friendly...
To the point Vida helped me find a unit in a very frustrating time for me explained everything perfectly making it much less stressful.
For anyone that needs a storage space come see her she  cares about you and ur personal belongings....
Once again thanks Vida.
ps I'm sure if the if this app was better handled you'd have more reviews on people as it is you probably don't get any reviews because the app is terrible but this person was excellent</Text>< response>

<Review>I have rented five or six times over the last seven years at Stevens Ave. Public Storage.  I have found this facility to be excellent.  The facility is clean, well maintained, secure, and easy to navigate with no surprises.

The staff has always been, professional, helpful, and friendly.  Juana the manager has been there for several years and has always been very enjoyable to work with.

Based on my consistently good experiences at the Stevens Avenue location, I would not hesitate to check with Public Storage first if I would ever need to rent at another location.

Customers should know that Public Storage does require renters insurance with the storage facility address listed as an insured location.  You can either buy insurance there, or arrange for it with your homeowners insurance.

Last time I priced rental coverage with my homeowners insurance, it saved me $5.00 dollars over the insurance sold at Public Storage for a short-term rental.   I just bought the public storage insurance, because I did not want to spend a 1/2 hour more on the phone with my insurance agency answering policy questions.   For longer term rentals, you may be able to save more money by adding the rental location to your home owners policy.

You will also need a Public Storage approved lock.   One of their approved locks is a round shielded shackle padlock.   They sell them for $15 on Amazon.  I bought mine at Public Storage years ago, and don't remember what I paid for it.   I think it was within a couple dollars of the Amazon price though.  [Update] Actually, I just look on the PS website and saw that their locks are a couple bucks cheaper than Amazon!

It is also very easy to reserve units online.  I have done this almost every time I have rented with them.  They have a variety of incentives on various sizes of storage lockers.  Do the math and you can find which incentive works best for your anticipated rental term.

While I have not rented with any other company, over the years I have occasionally shopped the competition, and also have gone with friends to their storage rental facilities.   I have never come across another company that offers more value than Public Storage.

I do not hesitate to recommend Public Storage.   For my needs their combination of location, facilities, and price is unbeatable.<//Review>< Rate>

She is always smiling and a joy to do business with.< /Review><user_id>106768701910419017632<//user_id><Response>None</Response>< Time>

I needed some packing and a box to ship my monitors for the school year, and the clerk was very helpful in finding the stuff I knew I needed and the stuff I hadn't considered. 5/5, would come back again.< /text>

< Review>
Swenson and Silacci's has phenomenal service. I live 3 hours away which makes it difficult to get flowers for the ones I love. They always cater to my needs and find me the best options. This place really has it together and seems to treat their employees with great care and kindness. They will continue to have my business as I do hope they have yours.</Review>

I've used "S and S" several times to send our Mom flowers. She is always so pleased with the arrangement. Owners are super friendly and thorough making sure you get the message and delivery just right. And, it's a lovely store to shop in!</Review>

My boyfriend has boughten me flowers from here a few times & they are super beautiful arrangements! However, I had roses delivered to my house about 4days ago and the flowers started getting droopy very quickly.. i contacted the shop to let them know that i couldn’t believe how the roses had gotten. They apologized & sent me another bouquet the same day! Best customer service! I really appreciate a business that is understanding :)
Thank you! ♥️<//text>

I ordered a flower crown and a small bouquet for my elopement and it was everything I had imagined and wished for!! They worked with my budget and the design I had in mind, and it turned out absolutely gorgeous! I’m one happy bride and thankful that I came across them after contacting other shops in the area that were not as communicative. Thank you ❤️< /Text>

This family run business is a staple in Salinas. The quality is excellent & if it isn't, they will make it right. It is my favorite place to order flowers. During holidays, they have great decororations to buy. Year around you can find unique gifts.</Review>

Excellent florist! I found them online and was impressed with the reviews. I live in SC and wanted to send flowers to a friend who had moved to the florist's local area. When I called to place my order, I was assured that a selection of the best flowers would be sent. My friend thought the flowers were beautiful and they are still beautiful over one week post-delivery. I highly recommend them.<//Text>

{'time': 1530055184401, 'text': 'Come on Jerry, do you really think we would say we don’t feel like doing any more deliveries today?? We both know that’s not the case. You likely called after our same-day cutoff - which on a normal day is around 3:00. There is a point in the day where we just can’t get it delivered. And even at that, many of us will drop orders off on our way home to keep last-minute customers happy.\n\nYou are welcome to have your opinions about us - all good. We value the feedback and use it to improve our product and service. But please keep it accurate and honest.\n\nMark Silacci'}<//Resp>

From the first call getting a quote with Tracey and getting help to get the flowers and look I wanted while helping me stay in my budget... now that's a team looking out for you. As a bride you can feel taken advantage of and this was not the case with swenson and silacci.
Lisa and I spoke via email and phone as I was about 3 hrs away. We made a trip down to meet with her and she totally got what I wanted and made it even better.
The flowers were stunning for my big day and made my wedding so beautiful.  I would recommend them to anyone!!</Text><gmapID>0x808df8eb57ffa191:0xc272e16e2affee7f</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We received a picture of them and they were nothing like we got from their website. In fact, they weren’t even delivered from them! They were delivered from flowers by toshi. When I called customer service we were told that they didn’t deliver because they don’t deliver to Watsonville. Which is false, I have have deliveries from Swenson to Watsonville more than once.
Never again. The bouquet that was delivered looked cheap and tacky, and I couldn’t have had that same basic bouquet that was sent ordered from Costco. We went with Swenson because of the image and quality, but they have let us down on a very special occasion.< /Review>< user_name>

Just got off the phone with Evette and she was EXTREMELY helpful and patient as I decided what to have delivered on Valentines Day. I am very impressed with this shop and I will most definately use them again in the future.</review>

< review>
If you knew how many years they've been in business... You'd understand why they're such a success! And not just that. Have you seen their Arrangements? These folks are professional and talented. I started work in the floral business in Pacific Grove in the 1970s and Swenson & Silacci was already a household name. When you think about the changes in the floral business from plastic flowers to silk.... from Mom and Pop flower shops to grocery store flower shops... These folks have stood the test of time and changed with the times. My mom recently passed away and I don't have a resale license anymore so it was a no-brainer when I looked for a flower shop to do the flowers for my mom's celebration of life and burial. Being a florist myself I couldn't let just anybody do the flowers. They had to be perfect and I can rest easy knowing that I chose the best in Monterey County. I'll post pictures after January 13th when they're delivered.< /review>

I ordered a sunflower bouquet & balloon for Mother’s Day. Before I ordered I called and asked for info on their balloon selection (because their website doesn’t show it) and was told they had a good selection on Mother’s Day balloons. Once delivered, no balloon came with. Not ordering again.< /Text>

Not happy. Got home and the boutenir I ordered did not come with a pin to pin it on my daughter's date for the prom.  No time to worry with these minor details.  Please  make time to retrain your staff with minor details on orders.</Review>

You wouldnt want to be in a hurry.... hard to find staff to serve ... some of the pre made boquets and boxes in the fridge display looked a little "tired"  but from all accounts they do a good job on fresh flowers- short on time we opted for a living basket that on closer inspection also had some dead parts on main plant.</Text>

Loved it here!!! Mangonada was super tasty. I did a passion fruit/coconut mix with the works and extra chamoy sauce. Next time I'll ask for extra chile. So good!!

The guy at the counter was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly! The decor is minimalist which I love. Really clean and neat. Definitely returning.<//text>

< review>
Booked a full day and did not disappoint. Had a great day during a tougher time of fishing. Fred is very knowledgeable in a wide variety of Techniques and can break down what you’re looking at on a graph to better understand what you’re fishing and how to fish it. For someone with years of experience to pick up a few new tricks or someone who has never caught a fish before. I HIGHLY recommend Fred Klinshaw<//review>

<time>1618970760615<//time><rating>5<//rating><Review>Without a doubt the best possible decision I could've made! My family and I fish Lake Casitas often, but really wanted to level up our knowledge of the lake to up our future fishing odds. After THOROUGHLY researching my Lake Casitas guide options, I made the stellar decision to go with The Hammer of Fury, Fred Klinshaw. By sheer luck my party of 3 got a last minute spot with Fred, he's so popular he's booked out WELL in advance, and we could not be happier with the day we had. We fished a half day morning from 7-11am and caught 8 very respectable largemouth in all. Two out of the three in my group had fish on on the first cast of the day! Fred is immensely knowledgeable, helpful, patient, fun, and an all around great guy to spend time with, I can not recommend him enough. It can be difficult trying to decipher between the available options and information regarding the guides in the area, but Fred's results and reputation speaks for itself. In fact, we enjoyed our time on the lake with Fred so much that we've already booked another future trip with him. Without hesitation, run, don't walk to book with Fred. You won't regret it.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsGJhyP3nExGqWwLgjuRJzpCwT4Ha2YKVhBs6C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCHaTtH3s5eVRIIb-MYddqWboktM2xfU2VqK8H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>{'time': 1619032077893, 'text': 'Thank you so much Adam.

<review>DO IT.

If you're on the fence about booking with Fred, wondering if it's going to be worth it, or if he's the right guide to go with...the answer is GET OFF THE FENCE, YES and YES. Just click the button, call the man, get on his boat, and go CATCH SOME D*MN FISH.

Fred is just a pure delight. We were curious to see if he would be willing to divulge information and answer our hundreds of questions we had about how, what and where to fish at Lake Casitas, and he did not disappoint. Fred was not only gracious in sharing his experiences and tips with us, but also so incredibly humble and hospitable in his approach.

The genuine excitement and thrill on Fred's face every time we set our hook and started reeling was just amazing - I don't know who was more excited about catching the fish! We were only on the water with him for 4 hours and landed 8 beautiful large mouth on the boat. Not only that, we kept on fishing after leaving Fred and caught another 3.

11 LARGE MOUTH FOR THE DAY. WHAT!!

Book WAY in advance. We got lucky and got a cancellation slot on the same weekend we were inquiring about, but he's usually booked 3 months out.

Just do it. You won't regret it.

SEE YOU IN JULY, FRED!

(Yup, we booked again. This time, we're going all the way and taking his entire day. 😉)</review></record></dataset><record>

Fred was amazing! He was super helpful and very patient. It was such a great experience I would recommend him to anyone! My boyfriend and I had a great time, every time we caught a fish Fred hyped us up and made the experience so much more exciting. He really is such an awesome fishing guide, he even gave us really good tips for fishing back at home which will come in handy. We will definitely be back. If you are hesitant on booking him for a guided fishing trip just do it you will not be disappointed! Thank you again for such a fun trip!< /text>

Fishing with Fred was one of the best experiences I've had on the water. He knows his spots and how to fish them like the back of his hand. Extremely knowledgeable, helpful and was so great with my 10 year old daughter that now she wants to fish with him every weekend!<//review>

Fished with Fred and my 8yr old son.  Best time you could imagine.  Coming from the fishing biz myself I can tell you that Fred is the best at what he does.  From the instruction, the  patience, the solid 1 on 1 time he spent with my son , it was all time.  If you want to get out on the water and try something with  your young fisherman that will put a huge smile on their face AND make them leave wanting to go again,  Fred is the right guy to see! See you again soon!< /Review>

<Review>Fred is the best bass guide in the business hands down. He's the best not just because of his knowledge of the lakes he knows like the back of his hand. From the first time we fished with Fred last year, it was very apparent that this would be a different experience. His enthusiasm and excitement are genuine and it felt like we had known him forever. Fred does all he can to share his knowledge about spots, lures and the latest bite. He answers all the when, where and why questions. He makes every person who sets foot on his boat feel welcome and appreciated and a better angler.

My son Weston and I have become regulars and we look forward to every trip with Fred. I have personally fished with him 4 times in the past 5 weeks. At this point, we're not just fishing with a guide but a great guy that we consider a good friend. If you get the opportunity to fish with Fred, do yourself a favor and book without hesitation.</Review><Date>1619488622449< /Date>< userid>

< Review>
Fishing with Fred was like fishing with a great friend that just happens to know everything there is to know about catching fish. From the first text to the wave goodbye leaving the parking lot from the docks this experience was truly exceptional. The thing I’ll take away most is how Fred truly cares about his clients.. i watched as my buddy Alex caught his first bass and the excitement and joy on Fred’s face was something that shocked me. His genuine joy for us was amazing!  Fred went beyond our expectations as a guide and made everything enjoyable and comfortable. I cannot wait until we are out there again!! Truly words cannot express this experience. You owe it to yourself to call Fred Klinshaw, beginner or seasoned vet and book a trip. You will not regret it

For us, even if the bite was horrible and caught nothing the conversation and knowledge would’ve been well worth it! Thanks again Fred for an awesome time out. You’re the best!</Review>

It was like fishing with a good buddy. We are already planning to book our next trip. I highly recommend getting out with Fred.

<review>A++++ experience!!
Anyone from beginner to experienced angler give Fred’s fishing charter a try, you won’t be disappointed. A buddy and myself went out for the first time and we didn't bring a single thing, Fred had everything we needed to have a great time. Not having to bring our poles, tackle or anything related was so awesome. We ended up catching about 10 big bass during our twilight trip. We learned a lot from Fred’s vast experience from all his years of fishing and 100% we will be going on another trip soon! Thanks Fred you’re one of a kind.< /review><pics>None</pics><gmap_id>0x80e83787bcf80167:0xf283f9ba234845f< /gmap_id>< user_name>

Recently went fishing with Fred and had a great experience and a super fun time! He knew all the spots on the water to find fish and did not let me down. He is a very knowledgable guide. His friendly and engaging personality made for great conversation and an easy going, fun trip. He has affordable rates for half day or full trip. I would definitely recommend going fishing with Fred! Thanks Fred for the great fishing trip!</review>

I took my 8 year old grandson fishing and it was his first time in a big lake fishing for bass. Everyone should know that Fred could not have been a better choice as a guide, teacher and ultimate fisherman.
He was able to teach my grandson (and me) a pretty advanced technique used for bass fishing. I think this is probably the best time I have had fishing and as you can see in the picture the grin on my grandsons face is a priceless memory.
Thank you Fred...we will definitely be back.< /review>

Fred’s engaging personality coupled with his positive attitude makes one feel as if you’re fishing with an old friend from the minute you step onto his boat. He was very attentive to a couple of specific requests I had. He provided  excellent gear for me to use along with instructions and advise that enabled me to be successful. I thoroughly enjoyed fishing with him! Looking forward to more trips in the near future. Thanks  Fred!< /review>

< Review>
I’ve fished with many guides over the years, but I have to say that Fred is the best of the best in term of 1) knowing where the fish are at, 2) how to catch them, and 3) most importantly how to have a good time doing it.

He meets you at your level of fishing experience and will teach you anything specific. I rarely miss top water bites now because I hear Fred in my head telling me to reel before I set the hook.

Good people, good time. You won’t regret a day with Fred even if it’s a tough bite.< /Review>

<Text>Had a wonderful time on the water with Fred.  We caught 5 hogs in 3 hours for an afternoon trip.  It was windy and I didn’t think we would catch, he showed us a special Klinshaw retrieve.  It was more simple but effective. I will go back again. And i have referred him to friends. Great guide!!!</Text></record></dataset><record>

I’m a hardcore fisherman who often has limited time to actually get out , so I like to choose wisely when investing my time on the water.  Fishing with Fred is more than just catching bass though, it’s a learning experience every time. From new baits and techniques to learning about finding fish and their behaviors.Very knowledgeable in his craft and it shows that it’s more than just a job for him...he likes to get you on fish!!!  Go check him out and GET BIT!!!<//Text></record>

Apart from being just a really nice person, Fred absolutely knows his stuff. He's priced well, has top quality equipment that is always in good condition and absolutely knows how to put you on the fish!

I've been out with him a few times and will continue to come back every opportunity I can get ! I've always booked full days that just disappear in a blur of fish catching and good conversation. I can't recommend him enough!</Text>

<user>104966906482995665731</user><text>Fred is one of the best fishing guides in Southern California. He has a plethora of knowledge to share and genuinely wants to teach and show his customers all that he can offer. It doesn't matter if you have never fished before or if you are a bass pro, you will have a stellar time with him! I had never fished fresh water bass prior to fishing with Fred and in one year and multiple trips with him, I have caught limits of good sized large mouth bass and had some great laughs at lake casitas. Don't second guess fishing with Fred, the return you will get is priceless!<//text><gmap_id>0x80e83787bcf80167:0xf283f9ba234845f< /gmap_id><Time>1583266657947<//Time><Resp>{'time': 1611420784277, 'text': 'Lexi!!

My daughter and I have fished with Fred a couple times so far. What a great experience you get. Nice roomy, fast boat. He bring all the gear you need and my daughter was adamant about catching a fish on her brand new pole I got for her. He had no problem rigging it up for me and she went to town on the small mouth bass. And letting her keep the rig for future use and so I can remember how to tie it too. I highly recommend using Fred as your guide for the lakes he offers. We fished lake castaic the first trip and lake casitas the second but trips producing good quality fish and quantity. Thanks for the awesome times Fred we will see you soon.< /Text>

Fred was INCREDIBLE. I brought my beautiful wife with me and our family. He was very attentive to each one of us, super helpful with any questions (not just with answering them but also answering by demonstration then allowing us to try)
He taught us new knots and showed us different baits to use.
Our sister caught her first fish; 3 POUND LARGE MOUTH BASS, then she caught another just as big!
Can’t wait to take another trip! Thank you SO much for such a fun day! Exactly what I wanted for my birthday!</review>

Fred is super knowledgeable fishing guide and he knows every piece of his lake and know when to fish where and has his solid theories/practices behind it. He is willing to share his know-how with you so next time even you go on your own boat you will catch big fish (but most likely you will fish with him next time). He is also very customer centric and would adjust his game plan with your goal and skill level to make it a perfect trip for you. All in all the best guide in Socal and I'll fish with him a lot in the future.</Text>

What an amazing day on the water with Klinshaw fishing, had the pleasure to fish with Fred and let me tell you what an absolute joy it was. Caught a couple fish and learned a life time of knowledge all while laughing an smiling the entire day. From beginners to experts Klinshaw fishing will let you learn at your own pace all while making you feel like a professional angler.</text>

We wanted the perfect first time experience for our kids and boy did Fred deliver!  What an amazing time.  He has tremendous patience for kids and knows his stuff.  My kids both caught 2 bass each and I got to cast the whole time while they did it!  Fred is the best, highly recommended!  Can't wait to book again!  The kids didn't want to leave.< /Review>

<Review>I have now fished with Fred at both Lake Casitas and Lake Castaic a few times when I am down south for work and every trip has been nothing short of great! He is quite the fisherman and has incredible knowledge in finding and catching fish.  Aside from his patience, he is an incredible teacher. I really enjoyed his explanation of gear and electronics. I enjoyed his instruction and reasons why we were doing certain techniques and fishing certain areas. We caught fish every trip and did something different each time. He also has very nice gear to use and plenty of tackle.  I will continue to book him every time I'm southern California.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Fred is a great guy and fantastic fisherman. Have been out with Fred a couple of times and have recommended him to others as well.  Fred strives to make sure that you have a successful and memorable time out. He is very open with his techniques and how to fish the tackle that he sets you up with and takes the time to explain why he is setting you up that way. His knowledge of the lake and it's fish are absolutely second to none.<//Text>

I randomly found Fred after Googling guides for Castaic and Casitas and really hit the jackpot with him. I couldn't agree more with all the nice comments being left by everyone. He is down to earth, genuine and a pleasure to be around and fish with of course! We had so much in common too, I left the dock with a guide and arrived back with a friend!

I went on a full day trip with Fred. I have a decent amount of experience fishing but wanted to go out and work with the best to improve. First of all Fred is easy to get a hold of, on time and the friendliest guy you will meet. Even with me having brought 7 fishing rods Fred still had new ideas for me. We absolutely crushed them! 11 total fish top 5 was well over 20 pounds. I do not want this to be only a review for people with fishing experience. If you are a first timer, have kids or a pro you will have a great time. Lake Casitas is awesome, mid week it feels like a private lake and Fred knows every cove and rock under water hahah trust me he does. You will have a great time have awesome pictures to take home and share with friends and family and most importantly have fun on the water. I already have friends wanting to book with me and we will be out again soon. Please give Fred a call and see what I’m talking about.<//Review>

Fred is a blast to fish with.  I have taken my sons out with Fred multiple times and we had nothing but great times. Fred is a great teacher for the novice and the experienced fisherman. Big fish, limits, and great company make great trips. We will continue to fish with Fred whenever we can.< /review>

<text>Showed up to the ramp bright and early, Fred was waiting there with stoke and a giant smile. Got a chance to do a full day with him and he did not disappoint! Offered us drinks, snacks, sunscreen, etc as we came on to the boat early and also throughout the day. Took us to many different spots throughout the lake to experience all different types of fishing. We were able to catch a solid limit with our biggest around 5lbs. I’ve been with him before and it’s the same every time....a fun, tremendous experience. Can’t wait to go back and hit those trout plants with him. He’s the most knowledgeable guide in SoCal. If you get a chance to go with him do it, you won’t regret it.He covers Lake casitas, Lake Cachuma, and Lake Castaic. Once again thanks and see you soon!

<Text>I have fished with Fred on numerous occasions at Casitas and I had an absolute blast every time! Fred is an accomplished tournament angler and communicates that knowledge to his clients to keep them on the fish. He is an all-around great guy and a consummate professional. His boat and equipment are second to none. Whether you are looking to catch your first bass or you are a seasoned veteran, you cannot go wrong with Fred.</Text>< time>

Hands down Fred knows how to catch fish and lots of them.. beginner to advanced this guy has you covered. I’ve been fishing with him for over 10 years now and we’ve never been skunked.. He knows when it’s time to move to another spot and when to switch baits to keep the action going...which is the hardest part about being a good fisherman or guide. Book with confidence anytime of the year. Fred is true professional with a lifetime of fishing experience few truly have. He runs legitimate bass boats and high quality gear so you get the full experience. Check out his Instagram page.. that’s all the proof you need; Limits of fish each trip and repeat and happy customers. -Dan</Review>

Can’t say enough about Fred as a person and a guide. Having recently relocated to Southern California from a hardcore bass family in Pennsylvania, whenever my family comes and visits we make a point to spend one day fishing at least. This past December, which is not exactly the time to be out searching for bass especially with the cold temps and rain, Fred took my Father, Brother, and myself out, which was the first time we had been together since the passing of my stepmother. He could not have worked harder for us, putting us on fish, suggesting different presentations, etc. etc. etc. It was an amazing day, despite the tough conditions, capped off with a 5 lber (which would be huge in PA!) caught by my dad. We already have Fred booked for next time the family is in town!<//Text>

In addition to a great view and surroundings, you get a great guide in an awesome rig. The Champion Bass Boat gets you from spot to spot in comfort and in a timely manner. You can literally show up with nothing or show up with 10 rods and reels. I try to fish with Freddy twice a year and I look forward to it like a holiday. I'm stoked to see he has expanded to Lake Castaic. Two legendary SoCal lakes to fish with a great guide and all you have to do is show up! Largemouth, Smallmouth, Crappie, Bluegill, Stripers.
Cheers!</Text>

Booked a half day morning trip with Fred in the dead of winter.  He set me up with a dropshot roboworm close to the bottom. We fished deep, about 30ft, and ended the day with a solid limit of bass in only a few hours.

Can’t say enough about how knowledgeable fred is of lake casitas. His champion boat is kept in perfect condition.  He was on time, always communicated, and would answer any questions I had.  A pleasure to learn from, total professional, and just a good hang.

I can’t wait to book another trip.<//review>

I travelled from NYC on a solo mission to fish and was put in touch with Fred. I’ve fished with guides all over the planet from Paris to Australia and Fred is right up there in the top three. Where do I start? His boat is so fast that you can fly from spot to spot in no time, after the ride to the first spot I was smiling like a 5 yr old who just went on their first rollercoaster. We must’ve hit two dozen spots throughout the afternoon. Not only does Fred work hard to put you on fish but he offers advice as you fish, in the way a father would give his child a fishing tip, not like some of the captains I’ve experienced that give you no advice and yell at you when you mess up. And last but definitely not least Fred is truly fun to fish with! The entire time as we’re catching 6lb bass and 3lb crappie he’s cracking jokes and making you feel right at home. Next time I’m in LA I’m booking him out for three days in a row!</Review>

<time>1472840681403<//time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>I love this Church. I am a new member here and can confidently say, the Community seems having lots of Faith. People actually experience the Sacrament of Confession (Saturday's Confession lines are incredible, in the most positive sense :-). It is a such a great sign of God in our laicized world.

What "bugs" me a bit is that the Holy Eucharist is kept somewhere to the side, instead of being in the center of the worship. I wish the priests responsible for this parish re-established the Eucharist to Its Holy place - the Altar, where the Christ is.< /Review>< pics>

Ordered a nuez obispo and they didn't have the nuez ice cream.  Took forever to get my order. They seemed they were in a rush because my raspado looked like it had been waiting a long time for me . Nothing like I expected.</Text>

They have great distancing policy for customers inside and outside. The people here serve great fruits and they take orders through phone as well.</Review>

<Text>This place is alright. For some reason there were little nats at our table and they closed at 6pm! A little weird. They did however have a huge food menu which is weird because it's mainly a raspado place but for whatever reason they sell enchiladas too??? Hmm...anyway. My fresas con crema were good and the service was pretty fast.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c34b0ad27e4a89:0xbdc5ac5b26b007e2< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Very poor customer service. Went in with my mom and not a greet or a welcome. We waited for them to finish helping a customer but once done they didn’t even help us. Kept walking back and forth. I felt ignored, So I left. Definitely not coming back.</Review>

Bad customer service people there are not friendly at all. We felt ignored. The guy at the register put our order on the counter said it was ready and countinue on his cell phone. I order a mango raspado and the mango was too hard, it was not ripe at all. Not coming back</text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad super bad service,
Bad attitude when serving customers do not know what they are selling!
We were the only customers and they took too long to serve us and more time to finish the order!
Bad bad bad

<text>(Translated by Google) I went to get an apple and banana Bionic, and all the apple they put in my bionic was rotten, also if you make an order by phone you have to pay with your card, otherwise you can't order anything, it seems silly to me!

Started with calamari appetizers... yummy..  Husband had the braised shortribs with mash potatoes with a touch of horseradish.   I had the grilled sea scallops over mash potatoes with lobster bits and asparagus.  I could see and taste the lobster bits.  Ended the meal with warm chocolate cake with homemade ice cream and cheesecake.  Our  server was delightful and did not oversell.  Loved the background music. All of us had a great dining experience and a very nice evening.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Nice place to dine and chill. Food quality is good and all meets are premium. But unfortunately compare to same quality foods they are a bit overpriced.< /review>

Been here multiple times but today (Mother’s Day) even with a reservation and seated, we got no service. The waitress seemed to avoid us and I had to ask for water in order to get her to even interact with me. And that was it. No further interaction to even to welcome us to the restaurant or ask if we knew what we wanted to order-for 30 minutes. We left. Extremely disappointing.
I understand it was busy, but we’ve been there during a busier dinner time and never had this issue.
Hector, the valet was the ONLY person who was helpful and provided excellent customer service.< /text>

<Text>Restaurant week in Newport Beach is a special event  we have enjoyed for many years and we had been looking forward to having some great dinners and supporting our local restaurants after the long Pandemic.  We had confirmed reservations for 7:30pm for a table of 4 persons and arrived precisely on schedule for our reservation and were seated immediately without delay.  Within a few minutes our waitress arrived.  We explained that we have a wine cellar and brought a special bottle from our cellar to enjoy &  offered to pay the corkage fee.  I asked if they had a decanter.  She told us they had decanters and a few minutes later she returned to announce they were all being cleaned and none were available  for us so they would "waive" the corkage fee.  She said she was going to attend to one other table and be back to answer any quiestions we had about the special selections for the evening.  She did not return.  After 45 minutes we flagged her down and she came over and asked abruptly, "So what do you want to order?."  We quickly made our selections.  30 minutes later 2 salads and one bowl of luke-warm soup arrived.  A cold breeze kept blowing out the outside propane heaters and it was uncomfortably cold. At 9:15 we had been seated for one hour and forty-five minutes and our food had not arrived, and more importantly, we had not received a visit to our table by the waitress or the restaurant owners to address the issue of no food in almost two hours.  We had to wave down our waitress to find out what was the problem.  During this time, it was obvious that other guests at adjacent tables had completely eaten their meals and left.   We did notice however that several other people who had waited for more than an hour simply left before receiving any food.  At 9:30, after having spent 2 hours and still getting nothing more than the initial salad an hour earlier, we confronted our waitress who said, "The kitchen is just really busy."  We had not ordered anything unusual, merely the items off the Restaurant Week fixed menu.  In disgust, we departed at 9:30 having never received our food.  We are all well-behaved, appropriately attired, retired local people in our mid-60's and we are not accustomed to such service.  We have enjoyed dining in Newport Beach at the wonderful water-front restaurants for more than 30 years. We have enjoyed visiting several local Newport Beach restaurants for this year's Restaurant Week promotion.   In that entire time we have never experienced the disappointment and poor service we had at the Bayside Restaurant. You would be well advised to find alternative dinner accommodations so you too are not disappointed.   Life is simply too short to tolerate such conduct with so many wonderful and delightful restaurants in the immediate area.< /Text>< pics>

We a regulars to Bayside for over 10yrs today's experience was by far a disappointment. Considering other options.
We have so much history in this restaurant we appreciated Glenn's professionalism and attentiveness,  definitely not the same restaurant.  Regardless of who you are, if your paying for service you should get it!

My overall experience was disappointing. It's pretty embarrassing really for how expensive the meals are and given the nice location in Newport.
I ordered the rib-eye medium rare. It was more like medium/med well and my jaw was tired chewing the tough meat... I also could've done without the reduction sauce which tasted like sour cream mostly. Mashed potatoes were okay I guess.
My girlfriend ordered shrimp risotto. The rice was sort of dry for risotto as it didn't have a sufficient amount of the creaminess to flavor the rice. To top it all off, the shrimp were overcooked....
I had high expectations paying $50 for a steak dinner. I was so disappointed.
Lastly, the service was average at best. I sort of expected more from the upscale environment the restaurant gave off.
This meal almost ruined my night.<//text>

<text>Nice atmosphere, music, and Courtney was really pleasant; however,  we had to wait 1.5 hours for our food! After inquiring several times about our order, we asked for the check for the drinks and appetizers. Another 30 mins go by and we requested to speak to a Manger. By then the food came out and was cold. 20 more minutes passed by, and finally the manager, Derrick, came and comped the appetizers and drinks but offered no real explanation or genuine apology as to why other tables were served that arrived at least 30-45 mins after us. Terrible recovery on the managers part. Just left the waitress out to sink!<//text>< pics>

Great way to end the weekend by having brunch at Bayside. I highly recommend the mimosa where you get a choice of cranberry or orange juice. That's $20 and great for 4 people. To splurge I ordered the open faced lobster sandwich with lemon mayonnaise. Very good. The patio was very nice and all socially distance compliant. If you're in the mood for great meal near Balboa island I recommend Bayside!<//Text>

Nice upscale restaurant complete with a jazz band they have a great bar and the filet mignon there is unbelievable and the fresh fish is cooked to perfection! Saturday night I like to sit at the bar in front of the jazz band, eat dinner and enjoy cocktails while socializing. A really nice place for an evening out.< /text>

To my wife for her 60th birthday and the food was excellent. The shrimp scampi was the best and the scallops were good also. Even the live music. The only draw back was they advertise its a great view of the ocean which is not true. But over all a really great experience. Would definitely try again.</text>

<Name>Jared Bostrom< /Name><Review>Horribly overpriced for the quality of the food and service. They are taking advantage of Covid having guests dine outside in a parking lot while still packing the restaurant completely full - sign of a greedy business owner. When we dined there, they ran out of propane for the heating lamps at 5:30 pm and everyone eating in the parking lot had to eat in the freezing cold. They did not seem concerned to resolve this for any of their guests. Will not be dining there again and would not recommend to anyone. If I could give them zero stars I would.</Review></record>

We got seated promptly. We placed our orders for appetizers around 6:15 and got the food at 7PM.

ordered our entrees at 7:15PM and by 8PM we still don't have it.

We know it's Easter. However,it's not that pack.

Common courtesy on all restaurant to check on you from time to time if you need anything else. Not of that happened.

It was also my brother's birthday. By 8PM,I asked our server to follow up on order. No apologies whatsover and when she asked if I want to speak to the manager,whilst I was still talking turned her back on me. That's crass service for you. Btw her name is Francesca.

Manager came and apologized but with no genuine sincerity.

Could have atleast comped the small cake for us being there for an hour.

Would have gone somewhere else in Newport had we known this is their standard operational procedure. Needless to say,STAY AWAY!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>Bayside is a beautiful restaurant with some truly amazing dishes. I ordered the chicken breast and found it to be delightfully juicy and seasoned perfectly. The ambiance was classy and the live pianist made it really fun. The prices are quite reasonable and the service is stellar.

<Text>The food here is excellent, but it seems like the size of the restaurant, number of patrons vs. number of staff exceeds their capabilities during the pandemic.  Each staff member was very kind and working hard, but were very overwelmed.  We had a 7:30 reservation and werent seated until after 8.  Once seated it took a while to get drinks and order food.  We didnt leave until after 10.  The customer service was great, but a number of employees were seen running (literally) to keep up with the amount of patrons.  I hope the staff is well cared for here because they are working extremely hard to keep up the service at this restaurant. Overall, I would definitely go back.  The food was worth it and the service was outstanding even though it was very obvious that they were overwelmed.<//Text><Date>1615646093097< /Date><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

We have come for our anniversary the passes 2 years and we are planning to come again next week for our next anniversary. The food is AMAZING. He loves the Chilean sea bass, it’s melt in your mouth good he said “it’s the most amazing thing he’s ever eaten in his life” the scallops are huge and my personal favorite. It hasn’t disappointed us so far! It’s definitely worth every penny. The owner is also super kind and all of the surfers we have had so far have been exceptional< /Text>

<Review>The food was delicious. We started with the Ahi Tuna tartare which was very good. My wife had the salmon which she enjoyed. I had the short ribs, which were tasty, but $38 was pretty steep for the portion of food that I received. All that being said, the service was bad. Our waitress was friendly, BUT inattentive. After the appetizer, my wife and I were twiddling our thumbs waiting for our entrees. She never apologized or offered an explanation for the slow service. Here's a hint: When you ask the customers if they saved room for dessert and they reply that they would like the check, don't take 15 minutes to bring it! I already had my credit card out and waiting for you when you finally brought the check which should have shown you, the waitress, that we wanted to leave.

The quality of the food was good, but a little too pricey for what you received and the service was bad. We will not be going back.< /Review>< pictures>

The food quality and preparation are excellent and the portions are close to super-sized; almost enough for 5 stars.

However the dated interior, the detached,  overbearing and intrusive wait staff, and the lack of creative presentation - detract from this otherwise excellent food.  The place feels tired.< /text>

We were celebrating a birthday.  Reservations needed. Good service, food flavorful, can be pricey depending on your budget. Free valet parking, but there are a few spaces in front of the restaurant where you can park yourself,  but they look to fill up fast.< /Review>

My personal experience.
Ambiance is lovely for dinner and fairy lights. Seating is great for groups.
But the table was round & a bit small.
Crab Cakes- it's just one & I'm not a fan of the white sauce or coleslaw. Not easy to share.
But overall the crab is good.
Oysters- Drew ate 3, said they were okay.
Cold crab bites with cocktail sauce- Drew loved.
8oz Filet- butterfly style & medium well was very done.
Potato- okay.
Bok Choy sautéed- yum!
Dessert-no seasonal options.</review>

Nice outdoor dining. Good service. Menu has changed quite a bit for Covid. Nice music too.
Not the same as it was b4 Covid. Can't wait till Covid is over and restaurants can go back to the quality and prices.</Review>

I would have rated this restaurant a 3 star if the manager would have been watching his employees and stepped in when our waiter was struggling.  We were expecting better service for a 4.5 star restaurant.  We made reservations for 7 people on Open Table for a birthday celebration at 7pm.  The waiter was knowledgeable about the daily specials however he did not heed warning on a severe allergy. He was told twice about the allergy and still served the item.  We also did not get our meals until 9pm.  Four of seven plates were cold. It was a Friday, 7pm... Not very busy enough to justify late and cold food.  Flavor profiles of food were pretty blasé. The chocolate lava cake was a disaster- the center had a very chalky consistency.  We all did love the bread, however not worth the $700 dinner bill.< /text>

Excellent food, great service, live music, easy parking. Very expensive, but the trick is to get a table by the bar and order off the small size menu, where the portions are smaller (which I like anyway) but just as delicious.< /Review>

<text>Very odd “service”. Literally were ignored for at least 45 minutes. Asked a couple times about a waiter/waitress or about getting a menu, and each time they passively pretended like they were going to do something, but then didn’t. Did finally get some water and a piece of bread. It wasn’t even the least bit busy when we arrived. It seemed like the servers were catering to local, wealthy, frequent patrons. We were hoping to have found a new restaurant for date nights in Newport. Unfortunately, this won’t be the place.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dce071a435159d:0xe9fe863f2f395282<//gmap_id>< userid>

I have been going to Bayside ever since they opened.  It never disappoints.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.  The fact that they have "happy hour" until they close makes it comparable to a "cheers bar" where everyone knows each other.  The chef is excellent, their soups are delicious and I highly recommend this restaurant.</Review>

<Text>I love a place with something different on the menu. Affiliated with Bistango in Irvine the food is good and the service was excellent. And you know what? I could hear everyone in my group speak. Some places are so loud. It was a very nice experience.< /Text>< name>

This place was amazing food was great. The environment was great. The only thing I have to say is there isn't anything to do around the restaurant so after or before you eat there isn't anything you can do but wait or go somewhere else. So if you going to eat here make your reservation on time and have something planned for after you eat if your trying to make great date. I usually like to walk and enjoy the view of the ocean, this location isn't good for that. But overall the restaurant was great for what it is.</Text>

< Review>
My family and I were in town visiting for Christmas, so my husband made reservations at Bayside Restaurant for Christmas Eve dinner. The service was exceptional, which is what matters most to me. Our waitress went out of her way to accommodate our children, and was extremely kind to them. The food was delicious, and so were the libations. We'll definitely dine here again on my next visit to Newport Beach.<//Review>

My boyfriend and I came here on Valentine's Day and we had made a reservation a month or so prior. We showed up about 10 minutes before our appointment time and there was a HUGE line out the door. It took us about 20 minutes just to get inside the restaurant only to see the line wrapping around inside the restaurant, too. Everyone in line was getting really rowdy because we had all made reservations but were still being forced to wait. I don't know why that happened? Maybe they were understaffed that night? But we ended up waiting about 45-50 minutes past our reservation time before we got seating.

The staff was really friendly there were very attentive. The food was also very good, but I don't think it was worth the price. I don't think I will be back to this restaurant.<//text>

I've been here a couple times and can say that many aspects of this restaurant are awesome. For starters, their service is very good and as long as a reservation is made it's a pretty quick sit-down upon arrival. On weekends they play live music on one side of the restaurant which makes it kind of nice; great date spot. The average age of the people dining here is definitely 45+ but still quite fun. Decent wine selection. Their food is very good. Their oysters are fresh. They have a beet salad which is mixed with some cream cheese and walnuts and is very tasty. Their fish is obviously very good but their filet mignon was also very well done. The filet migon come with a side of 3 different types of potato which is unique, mashed, a fried big potato chip and some roasted potatoes. All in all great experience and highly recommend going here with family or a special date night.<//Review>

Our family went for the Fathers Day fixed menu, there were six of us and everyone had a different course choice and loved it; not a crumb left.  The service was impeccable.  We stayed for almost three hours but we tipped extra for tying up the table and the staff's service was courteous to the end.<//Review>

One of our favorites ,we always sit at the bar.We go early too.
Service is excellent and so is the food
Always consistent. I wish they would bring back the seared Ahi though.
We go quite often.< /text>

Musical brunches and impeccable service. If you can have Richard as your server, you will be pleased! Oh, and did I mention the free valet? 😀 And the food... Superb execution with the finest quality and ingredients. As a brunch fan I had the sausage hash. The sausage was excellent and the creative use of gnocci instead of potatoes was surprising and delightful! My wife, ever a swordfish lover found the papaya relish out of this world.<//text>

This is fine dining restaurant with a large bar and outdoor covered seating. Great view of Harbor across the street. Happy Hour menu is great. Their happy hour pretzel bun burger is one of the best around.  Plenty of parking. Live music usually a trio or single musician. No dance floor. Caters to a mature crowd over 50.<//text>

Wonderful fine dining establishment tucked away southeast bayside in Newport Beach. Large open bar area with entertainment and several dining areas including ample patio seating. Robust wine selection and a diverse menu selection. Not looking for a full menu and to make a full night of it...then i recommend sitting in the bar area and enjoying their tapas bar menu while selecting a nice wine by the glass. Class A service. Wonderful location for date night, family celebrations, or work related dinners.<//review>

<Review>I enjoyed this Restaurant immensely. Went on a Weeknight and decided too choose a few appetizers. They were delicious as well as my drinks. They have a piano bar atmosphere if you choose or quieter seating if you like. My overall opinion of Bayside was a good one. I will be back to enjoy some of the delicious entree's that we're pointed out by the locals that nite. All good from what I heard. Enjoy the nite time atmosphere...it's intriguing!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

One of the few remaining gems in newport, the location, ease of access, food & service quality are all unmatched. Perfect for an intimate dinner or a night out with a few couples</Text>

<review>Service and wait staff are very good and attentive.  The lobster appetizer was very good.  My caprese salad was not very good
The tomatoes were not flavorful nor vine ripe, the burrata cheese was gooey and luke warm and overall no flavor to the dish. Vegetarian options are very limited, primarily salads. The patio dining was nice.  The primary reason for only a three star rating is the musty/earthy/moldy smell in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen and restrooms.  Anytime a restaurant smells like that it makes me wonder about the condition of the kitchen facilities and is just an overall turnoff.< /review>< pictures>

Three years straight I listed online  that we are celebrating a birthday,  and nothing happened.  Today I looked the manager in the eye as we entered and said it`s a birthday, and nothing.  I spoke to that manager as I left , and no apology.   I will not visit Bayside again<//text>

On December 15, 2017, my family and friends plan to attend the Christmas Boat Parade, which we do every year and usually make reservation, because the best ones book up fast,  which a friend recommended Bayside. This restaurant ambience was so pleasing and they had live music,  which remind me of the restaurants back home in New York City,  but we had one hiccup,  which this young blond hair woman,  which I assume she was the head hostess, but I'm not sure,  well we running late sitting in LA traffic,  so we call Bayside to let them know that we will be late,  but are friends  were there already,  but not seated , so they went back outside to wait for us.  So this hostess took upon herself to cancel our reservation,  which she stated because our friends left the restaurant to wait for us outside , even after we call to let them know we running late.  So when we got there we had to argue with her to explain why she cancel the reservation. This woman was trying her best  not to accommodate us until we talk to the manager,  who was wonderful,  but she had nerve to tell my sister,  I'm going seat you , but I have a reservation for this table and you got a hour then you got to get up.  I was shock this came out this woman mouth,  but my sister put her straight and told her will get up with when are finish,  which we had only 45 minutes  anyway because of the time wasted with her.  She really took away the experience for six of us to enjoy our food.  Overall I will still give Bayside restaurant 5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ because the staff services was excellent our waiter was the best and the food it was well cook and season,  which I had the pork chop, this thing was huge and cook to perfection and so tender , and definitely try the pasta dishes. I would recommend everyone to try Bayside restaurant , beside our one little hicup,  I will be coming back to this beautiful restaurant to also enjoy the live entertainment .   Also I want to thank the Manager,  who I didn't get his name,  for being so attentive in making sure we taking care of,  something you need to teach the young lady on dealing with diverse clientele.<//Text>

<date>1518714396789<//date><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Came here for Valentine's Day 2017.

Ooooh, where do I start? Waited 60 minutes outside of the restaurant in a long line for our 8pm reservation. Line was about 80 people strong.

Sat down at 8:45pm, at a tiny table in a corridor between other tables. Ordered a seafood appetizer in addition to our $75/person set menu. Restaurant forgot the seafood order.

Their advertised prix fix menu had items like Foie Gras and other fancy items but was deleted and not on the menu when we arrived at the restaurant. Appetizer came out at 9:30pm. Entree came out at 10:15pm.

People that sat down after us got their food first some how (both tables ordered steak and rack of lamb). Asked for dessert to-go and for the check along with the entree. Worse meal ever.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>We've been to Bayside several times and the food has always been great. However, our visit last night was not so great.  The the fish had very litle flavoring and the mango sauce was sour. I was so impresed with the veil last visit i decided to try it again.  This visit the veil was prepaired too rare and lacked flavor. As usual the service was excellent.</Review><username>ocff</username>< gmapID>

<review>I recently brought scottish tuna salad and III course - Prawn with somethin. First of all its too pricey and the quantity is like you are giving it away to a "small kitten". With this much price and less quantity is not at all fair. It did not taste good also.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Had a reservation for 830 but Arrived at facility at 8:05 and was instructed to stand in line becuase they over booked thr night. There were  dozens of couples standing in line all with reservations,  some people were waiting over an hour to get in the door. Finally was seated at 9:05 And didnt get the drinks until 9:20.  By the timr the bread came around on 9:28 we said f-- it and walked out.  Never got to try the food, sorry.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Came here with a reservation on Valentine's day. They admitted that they over booked and we didn't get seated until about 40 minutes after our reservation (which btw, they make you wait outside in a line). Then we sat and it took another 20 minutes just to get bread. So we left. Sorry we can't rate the food....< /review>

<review>Went here with a friend for dinner. Once the waitress found out that we were not ordering drinks, and got tap water, she was not as attentive. Not knowing how much we were capable of eating of course! She came by to get our order, as we are talking to her and about to ask her what she recommends, without saying anything she left and went to another table to take care of another customer, At this point I'm furious and frustrated and my friend and I are just staring at her wondering if this is really happening!  She comes by and touches my friend's hand after our staring session and tells us she'll be right back, still no apology for the ignorance earlier. She comes back after what seemed to be longer than "right back" , I asked her if we could finally order or if she was still busy, at this point she finally apologized. Frustrated with bad service, I did not bother asking her what she recommended. She didn't even bother telling us whta the soup of the day was, I had to ask.
There is no Mushroom Bruschetta on the menu anymore. so we got the followings:
Roasted Red Beets and Goat Cheese   ===== Good.. but different, I'm used to my goat cheese being more sour/ tart
Tomato Burrata Mozzarella============ This was good, I recommend it.
we also go the soup of the day which was half carrot and half sweet potato soup . It was too creamy for both of our taste.
Grilled Pacific Swordfish ============ BIG FAN.. My favorite! but that's uf you love Lemon.. I am a ture lemon lover and the lemon risotto was nothing but perfect, my friend however was not a big fan
Halibut ================ Okkkkk.. nothing spectacular..
For desrt we got :
chocolate souffle (AMAZINGGG, we each got one)
we shared the following items:
Caramel banana pudding ======= I love bananas and caramel but this was way too sweet and way too over powering and the pudding was very caky.. the texture.. not my favorite
Homemade sorbet ============ It was good. but then again tasted like sorbet :)

Two tiny girls ordering all these food, got the waitress moving and she started paying more attention to us..

Overall
SERVICE ===================== 1
Food ========================3.5
Ambiance ==================== 4.5

Overpriced for what it is. I will not go back unless I have to<//review><time>1463629331496<//time><Rating>3<//Rating>< Response>

The only thing i wanted was a cheeseburger. On the menu online it said they had it. In the resturaunt they did not have it and my wifes' pasta was hard and tasteless. Then we proceeded to get dessert which was basically a cup of pudding with oreos in it for $10. I would not reccomend this burdon of a resturaunt to anyone.</Review>

<review>Service was awful, food was great. We didnt get our menus until 20 minutes in, our waitress would ask questions and walk away without waiting for an answer. Example, i brought my friend a hosting gift, she asked "oh, is it your birthday?" As we were answering she walked away and didnt even care that it had nothing to do with a birthday. Then later comes by and said she was bringing out a souffle for "her birthday", again, we told her that it wasnt her birthday, her response? "Oh, well its coming out anyway." We waited so long for every single part of the lunch, 2 hours later, neither of us even bothered staying for it. You should come for the food but dont expect basic service.< /review>< Response>

< review>
I came here to end my Orange County Restaurant Week experience and it was a fine choice! The restaurant is secluded adjacent from some beautiful housing and apartment complexes. There is a waterfront view if you're seated outside or by the window. I made reservations for two because this is quite a popular restaurant and it had to be as perfect evening out. That night the restaurant also provided complimentary valet. What an added bonus!

The ambiance was excellent, however; the seating arrangement we had was little odd. I prefer to sit across from someone rather seating side by side, but whatever. We started off with a little wine -- Pinot & Chardonnay, then it was off to ordering off the selected pre-fixed menu.

Food --
1st Course:
- Soup of the Day: Chicken Barley, which was a bit on the salty side but it was alright. I added some water to dilute the saltiness.
- Anjou Pear Salad: Beautifully presented. Love the display on the plate and very colorful. I made the wrong choice, but luckily we shared.

2nd Course:
- Tiger Prawns: This was supposed to my dish since I love seafood but this had the attention of my date, so why not. The prawns were served with a delicious risotto! Wow loved that dish.
- Prime Culotte Steak: If you're a meat lover, this dish is for you. It was served with blue cheese potato fondue and asparagus. Although this dish was excellent, the prawns was much better in my opinion.

3rd Course:
Selection of any dessert on the list
- Panna Cotta w/ Raspberries: Delicious! Creamy, sweet texture and the portion was very generous.
- NO Bread Pudding: Date loved this. The restaurant was also nice enough to add candles and decoration to make it extra special. It's very rich, so watch out.

Overall, this has become one of my favorite restaurants in Newport Beach. Location, atmosphere, price, food, and service deserve high remarks. Come hungry because portions are a nice size. Definitely recommend this spot to anyone!</review>

Terrible servo e for a new customer. I showed up early - had to wait 25 minutes then they told me they're running late.

Then they wouldn't give me PII paperwork back.

TERRIBLE! Never again.</review>

I have been going to this dentist (Dr. Bunkers) for over 30 years.  The staff here is excellent, and you are treated with a smile and you feel like they care.  Must be a great place to work since the staff seems to stay.  I have been with the same hygienist (Peggy) forever, she is perfect.  Always upbeat, and efficient, and makes it an easy visit.  No one likes going to the dentist, but, this office makes it so easy, it's no big deal!  Friendly, knowledgeable, fair pricing, what else do you need?< /text>

<Review>I detest going to the dentist, let's get that out of the way up front.  Although I still get anxious coming here, they are very welcoming, and nice.  Dr. Savani is really good.  She takes the time to explain everything to me and makes sure that I am ok the whole time.  She always takes the less invasive course of action, and seems genuinely interested in my well being.  The front office staff took a little time to warm up to, but maybe they were just busy.  Dental assistant staff is great and friendly.  Overall, very happy with this dental practice.</Review>< pictures>

San Dimas Dental Group is the BEST Dental group hands down!! I have been going to Dr. Bunkers since I was 5 years old. My entire family have been loyal clients of Dr. Bunkers simply because he is the best. He is honest, and strait to the point. There is no one else that I would ever trust with my teeth :)

Thank you to everyone at San Dimas Dental Group for all you do!

I've been a patient at San Dimas Dental Group for over 7 years. My wife has been going here for twice as long. We love this office so much that we don't mind driving about an hour each way for our appointments. All of the staff could not be more professional and friendly. Peggy, the dental hygienist I see for most of my appointments is a wonderful person and always gives me the best care. You always feel like you're in the best hands at San Dimas Dental Group.</Text>

<Review>Joe and I have been coming to San Dimas Dental Group for 20 yrs or better. We would like to compliment how wonderful Julie is. She has been one excellent hygienist. Never have had one problem. Can't say enough about every single person there. Joe will only request Julie for cleaning. She clean my teeth the last time I was in and I see what he is talking about now. Thank you to all the hygienists.

Dr. John P. Bunkers has been my dentist since the late 1980's when I lived in Diamond Bar and I now live in Long Beach since 1997.  Dr. Bunkers is an excellent dentist, up to date on the latest procedures and equipment, professional, gentle, painless and has a good sense of humor.

During the years I have been in need of more than one root canal and they were performed by Dr. Goren who is in the same office and equally professional, gentle and painless.

Cindy the receptionist and Diane the insurance professional have been there since my first visit which speaks volumes regarding the family feel of the office.  The entire office staff, technicians, Hygienists, Doctors are Excellent, well worth the 90 mile round trip.<//Review>

<review>Dr. Brar was able to successfully fill a cavity that was under the gum line in such a way that not only ended up looking great cosmetically, but also literally saved my tooth from either a root canal or an extraction.  He was willing to work with me in terms of helping me to find appropriate dental materials that I was not reactive to based on my Clifford report and I am pleased to say that I have had no problems since he completed the work. He conducted a thorough exam, which included assessing how deep the cavitation was and whether or not it was going to affect the nerve, and then developed a detailed and appropriate treatment protocol to take care of the problem.  His friendly and professional demeanor was critical: He explained everything that he was going to do, as he was doing the procedure, and as a result, this event was both painless and stress-free.  Excellent experience, in every way.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

San Dimas Dental Group is the best. I've been going there since I was 9 years old (now 29) and have always received quality dental services. I grew up in the area but haven't lived there for the past ten years but still come back twice a year, they are well worth the hour drive!< /review>

I have been a dental assistant here for 9 years and the doctors and staff here are caring and honest.  I would recommend this office because it's not an office that pushes unnecessary treatment like some others do and patients are treated with respect and compassion.

I have been going to this dental office since 2004 and have never had a bad experience. Dental Hygienists are great my new dentist is Dr. Savani and while I've never had to have any work done by her, she has been great! I'll have my first experience with her in June as I need to have a cavity filled....

Highly recommend!</review>

I have trouble getting numb and she was very caring to make sure that I was comfortable. I was so impressed. The whole office staff is friendly, too.<//Review>

<review>Experience was outstanding every time!  Dr. John Bunker is an excellent dentist and leader in his profession. He took the time to explain every procedure he was doing.

For example, when I received my night guard he explained the symptoms of bruxism, grinding of the teeth at night, sore jaw, and morning headaches. Dr. Bunker was very supportive and thoroughly explained the preventative process.

Yvette, the hygienist, was also very knowledgable, professional, and had a naturally lovely personality. I would recommend Dr. Bunker and the San Dimas Dental Group to everyone. Don't hesitate to call. This is best dentist I have ever had.<//review></record>

<Name>Michael Rosso</Name><date>1432846746997<//date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>My last visit here was pleasant, as usual.  Cindy greeted me at the front desk and I signed in and waited maybe 5 minutes at the most before my name was called. I had Peggy as my hygienist as I have for the past few years since she, to me, is my favorite since I feel she is the most personable hygienist.  She is very gentle and I feel she is very cognizant of my well-being while I am in the chair while I am getting my cleaning and I just relate to her more than I do with the other hygenists, not to say the other hygenists are any worse than she is but I just like the way she does her job and am most comfortable with her as she likes to make her patient feel as relaxed as possible, I feel.  She also gave me x-rays and made sure that she stayed with me until the doctor came to check on them.  I have been coming here for over 15 years and this is by far the best dentist I have been to as they put a premium on customer service far more than any other I have visited.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I am always hesitant to visit the Dentist, so I procrastinated several years. My recent visits with Dr. Brar was a fantastic experience. He provided me information of each visit and walked me through each process and procedure. Dr. Brar knows what he is doing and is very kind to the patient as well to his staff. Wendy the Dental Assistant was nice and calmed me down throughout the visit.

I wish I had found this wonderful Dental office earlier. I seriously can't want for my next visit and I look forward to healthy teeth and gums soon.<//Review>< Name>

No enough good words for Dr. Savanni and staff. Dr. Savanni just "would not give up" until my difficult- to- set implant crowns were perfect. Lots of polishing, setting, adjusting but my mouth is perfect. And NO PAIN! It doesn't get any better! Professional, pleasant, dedicated staff.<//Text>

Dr. Savani and her staff are fabulous.  They are professional and friendly and always make you feel well taken care of and special.  My wife and I have been coming to San Dimas Dental Group for the past 20 plus years and even though we have recently moved to Corona we will continue with SDDG because they are that special.  Well worth the drive!</Review>

<text>I have been a patient at this dental group for many years, back when they were in the San Dimas Medical building and in the building at the corner of Covina Blvd. and Lone Hill. My original dentist has retired, and I have had Dr. Savani for several years now. Today, it was Yvette who cleaned my teeth. She was especially pleasant and most importantly, competent. I would definitely recommend this dental group.</text>< Pics>

<Text>I have had Jean as my hygenist in the past but more recently have been taken care of by Julie. Both ladies take their time while doing cleanings and checking my dental work. They are very efficient at what they do and don't cause any undue pain or discomfort.. When I walk out of the office, I don't feel like I've been "beaten up".</Text><time>1438607994698</time>< user>

<review>Such a wonderful dental office.  Everything is done on site and is so convenient.  Got a crown done all in one day within just a few hours.  Also I experienced the very best (RDH) Dental Hygienist ever with Yvette.  Seriously in all of my years ever going to a dentist and getting cleanings and gums scraped and poked, she is by far above the best and has the most efficient and most gentle hands that my teeth have ever experienced.  Also, Dr. Savani is amazing.  I finally after many many many years of never sticking with a dentist or never going consistently have found someone I can really feel confident and reassured with.  Also my husband who is the biggest dental chicken in the world is even going the see Dr. Savani at San Dimas Dental Group on a regular basis.  What I really appreciate is that she will not try to push any unnecessary dental treatment on me and let me know that things are good.  If I do have an issue she seeks out the issue and will only recommend treatment as needed.  She won't suggest unneeded whitening or to unnecessarily change out fillings, like other dentists have in the past.  I highly recommend San Dimas Dental,  Yvette, and Dr. Savani.  Also everyone in the office and all the staff is friendly and amazing too.  I have been a patient there now for a few years and am very happy.</review>< Rate>

It is a super professional office, the office staff is awesome and always knows exactly what I need to pay or not pay and they are always right on (I never get a bill later for more money).

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I have been going to the San Dimas Dental Group since I was a young child. I wouldn't consider visiting any other dental practice. Everyone in the office is so friendly, and it's evident that they truly care about each and every one of their patents. Dr. Savani is absolutely amazing. She makes her patients feel totally comfortable. Dr. Savani always takes the time to throughly inform her patients, and discuss all possible treatment plans in regards to dental health and wellness. Peggy Dochterman is my absolute favorite hygienist! I make sure to request her each time that I book an appointment. She is professional, kind, and makes me feel at ease. I highly recommend San Dimas Dental Group to anyone who is looking for a high quality dental office. I assure you that they will not disappoint.</review>< Pics>

AATBS coaching made all the difference for me in preparing for and passing the exam. At first, I wasn't even going to use the coaching option, but in my first coaching session with Elizabeth Price, she helped me gauge my status, create a targeted study plan, and gain a positive, confident perspective. The quality of the study materials, the online practice exam resources, and personalized coaching make AATBS worth it. If you want to be prepared, I would highly recommend!<//text>

I worked with Dr. Elmore as my coach and she was great! I really appreciated how knowledgeable she was about the pass rates and study techniques in areas where I was struggling. She also really helped put into perspective where I needed to focus my attention every step of the way, which made it much easier for me to focus on studying! Thanks so much for helping me PASS!< /review>

I was fortunate to work with Dr. Erin Elmore as I prepared for the CPLEE. Dr. Elmore provided excellent perspective on how to think about the test and how to focus my study and overall preparation. Her strategies for test day were extremely helpful and pushed me over the finish line to pass. Excellent experience!< /text>

I purchased the program a few years ago and life got in the way and I was able to restart my study with Elizabeth.  She was great and gave good tips.  After studying for 9 months and working with her I passed the first time.

Would so recommend the program and Elizabeth.</Text>

I purchased the complete package offered by AATBS for the LCSW exam.  The material was overwhelming but my coach, Elizabeth Price was able to help me prioritize and assist me in coming up with practical steps to tackle the material.  Her encouragement and guidance throughout my preparation was very helpful in keeping me in check.  The practice tests and the audio files were the most useful to me in terms of the material, but the value was in my 1:1 coaching with Elizabeth.  Many thanks to Elizabeth for her support and believing that I could do this!< /review>

the aatbs package -- including the printed study guide; on-line workshop and associated slides by dr erin elmore; and coaching session with dr elmore -- proved to be a tremendous boon to passage of the cplee.  not having taken an examination as such in decades made this especially freighted with angst.  the study materials, as well as the practice examinations, were invaluable, and dr elmore's consultation was instructive in assisting, confirming, and affirming various elements of the process for me, not least including establishing a plan of study and approach to the examination, specifically for someone quite well-along in their career, and relocating to a new state.  her individualised approach was very edifying.  other staff and those in customer service, such as amy weil and sabrina dominguez, were readily available to answer all of my questions, and assisted me whenever i encountered a difficulty.  i can highly recommend aatbs.<//text>

So many great things to say about AATBS! I bought the complete package and it was so helpful in covering all the domains necessary to be successful on the test.  I also worked with Kristen Wilkinson as my testing coach and she was an excellent resource not just for study planning, but for encouragement and support! I passed the EPPP on my first attempt!< /Text>

I just passed the EPPP on the first try with the help of my coach Erin Elmore! She was super supportive throughout my journey and encouraged me to take it even when I didnt feel ready. I truly feel like she prepped me as best as she could --even down to warning me to wear layers because the room was cold. Thank you, Erin & AATBS!</Review>

I worked with Dr. Erin Elmore. She was incredible and so very helpful. I felt that her knowledge was superior, and the AATBS program was great too. The practice tests were great and the books were beneficial too. It was a lot of work, and I felt so very thankful to be working with Dr. Elmore. She kept me level headed in times of stress. Excellent program and tutor (I would recommend to anyone).<//text>

<text>I must start by saying AATBS is what you make of it. It provides all the necessary material to successfully pass the EPPP. However, it also requires extreme dedication and a serious time investment to maintain progress, which I did not initially have. When I fully committed to my studying progress was significant. This was in large part, if not entirely due to the support of my coach, Kristen Wilkinson, Psy.D. She provided study plans, techniques, timelines, and encouragement even when I was at my most pessimistic. Dr. Wilkinson was pragmatic, optimistic, and realistic in what I needed to do to be successful. I truly owe my licensure to her dedication and support. Take away: get AATBS, commit/don't waste time, get a dedicated coach who you match with, meet with him or her regularly.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I am quite pleased with my initial consultation with Rob Feiner,
my exam prep coach. Rob's tone was so personable, clear, and beneficial to my confidence in working with him to study for my CA Law & Ethics exam. I may even continue working with Rob Feiner, who also coaches for the NCMHCE exap. Thanks Rob!</Text>

In my opinion AATBS prices are too high for what they are offering.  There is no online content available in the subscription I had aside from practice tests.  The practice tests had many typos and were poorly written.  I had problems with the website.  My coach was unable to provide me with support and did not know the answers to any of the problematic questions that I found on the exams. The DSM workshop offered to me was outdated.  I do not recommend AATBS and found much greater success with Dr. Linton's program available for a fraction of the price.< /text>

I worked with Dr. Erin Elmore who is consistently kind, professional, patient and knowledgeable. She held faith in the process of passing the CPLEE even after my 2nd exam failure. I got back on the horse and she helped me triumph on the 3rd try. It was such a hard exam for me bc some of my typical ways of knowing and processing knowledge were not available to me. This is exam is abt knowing the material and having good recall even when the questions were confusing or absurd. I’m so Grateful for Erin’s kindness and patience throughout the process. If you get to work with Erin, consider yourself Blessed.< /Review>

I was SO very fortunate to have been assigned to Erin E. for my test prep coaching. She was refreshingly professional and knowledgeable. Her support and encouragement, in addition to her expertise,  were invaluable to me during a very stressful time - working, studying, and parenting in the midst of a global health crisis. If you are fortunate enough to acquire coaching, I highly recommend requesting Erin. You will be so very happy you did.<//review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>I used AATBS to study for the EPPP. I was happy with my experience and was able to pass the test the first time. The books were easily digestible and the corresponding study guides were useful in organizing my studying. The practice exams and domain and section quizzes were the most helpful aspect of the package. I didn't find the audio files or flash cards to be especially useful while studying. By far the best feature of the program was access to a coach. I was lucky to work with Erin Elmore. She was amazing; encouraging and supportive all the way through! Erin was also really helpful in planning out my study schedule. She was able to tell me which domains to focus on and keep me on track. Studying was definitely made a lot easier with her help!< /text>< gmapID>

<review>Anyone taking the EPPP exam is going to need to prepare. I found AATBS’s program to be very helpful. The online exams were the most helpful, with the written materials being a close second. I did not rely much on their flash cards, as I made my own, and the audio files are just okay. Don’t underestimate the helpfulness of coaching. Kristen W. was my coach and she was fantastic! Yes, a coach is going to be supportive and encouraging, but Kristen also provided a lot of helpful test-taking tips. That goes a long way in your confidence level and in your actual test performance. Overall, I found the AATBS test prep package very helpful In passing the exam.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>There were a couple of times where I had to contact costumer service and I always found them helpful. The program seems a little overwhelming and I initially had no idea how to navigate it in a way that would be effective. Take the assessment test before you do anything else.

I took the assessment test and set up an appointment with a study coach. I was assigned Erin Elmore and she was so helpful of making sense off the program, setting up a study plan and help ease some of my anxieties and those unrealistic expectations I had set for myself and gave me both study and test tipa. It definitely worked out as I passed the EPPP last week!

I'm just glad my school provided me with this program though, because it's definitely on the pricier side, otherwise it would have been 5 🌟<//Review>< pictures>

I was lucky enough to get Kristen W for my coach. She was the game changer for me. She helped clarify a study plan and gave me concrete advice on how to change my studying when I kept getting stuck. Her support and encouragement is what kept me going. I found all the self paced workshop, hard copy of flashcards, and audio recordings were most helpful. And, the test master exams were key. I took each one three times to increase my comfort level. I didn't think the online flashcards were helpful to me. I also used the older system, which I got used too and had difficulty switching. The customer support was great. They were prompt emailing me back and with fixing any issues I had. Once again, Kristen was the reason I didn't give up my studying. She put it all in perspective. I'm truly grateful for her knowledge and skills and support. Thank you AATBS<//Text>

Review was comprehensive and spot on.  Elizabeth Price was an excellent coach, providing information, feedback and encouragement. She was able to provide real time feedback as the exam changed (number of questions) and test takers provider her immediate feedback.  You have to put in the work, but this prep provided the right tools.  Online practice was key.  Incidence of repeat questions on the practice exams were frustrating-my only criticism.  Fabulous preparation, thank you!</review>

The practice tests helped to improve my test taking skills and knowledge.  My coach, Elizabeth Price helped me understand how to look at questions from a different perspective and really understand what the test is looking for. Thank you, AATBS!</Review>

<Review>I am writing this review about my experience with my coach, Elizabeth. She had a lot of knowledge about the test, and sent me resources that paid off big time on test day. I passed the test with a good score and felt really prepared when the time came. I recommend Elizabeth to anyone looking for help in preparing for the test. It was well worth the time. Thanks, Elizabeth!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I am writing to review my experience working with Elizabeth Price.  It was outstanding!  I didn't pass my first time taking the exam and I had a different coach.  I requested a new coach thinking it would be helpful to have a new person.  Elizabeth was amazing!!!  She helped me to calm down and she met with me weekly!  My other coach was not able to be as accommodating.  Elizabeth gave me unique ways to approach the questions and helped me to apply my studying time in the right way.  She was truly an asset in getting me to pass the second time!< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Overall excellent experience. There is a lot of material to review which is helpful, but I think the practice tests are key to successful preparation. The one-on-one coaching is a nice addition as it helps keep you motivated and is a great way to get information and questions answered. My coach was Elizabeth Price and she was extremely supportive, responsive and professional. I really valued the regular phone calls with her.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80e84d51b0393a87:0x87cd7f45d53327f3</GmapID></record>

Thanks so much AATBS and my coach Dr Erin Elmore for helping me pass my EPPP on my first try! I appreciated (and needed) the encouragement and consistent support along the way. This system is not cheap but very much worth it!< /review>

<text>My coach, Elizabeth Price, was wonderful! I purchased this study tool with the hopes of being more prepared for my Law and Ethics exam for my ACSW renewal. I really do not think I would have made it through without her. She was patient, and willing to explain things in different ways until I got it. I passed my test!!!! She even called me a few days later to see how I did. She encouraged me with my scores and was always on time. Thank you so much Elizabeth for being a part of this journey with me.</text><Resp>None</Resp><Pics>None<//Pics>< Time>

<Text>AATBS has been an amazing experience! The study materials, workshops, and coaching was extremely helpful in preparing me for the MFT National Exam. I would really like to thank my coach Elizabeth Price for being a great coach and mentor through my testing process. I felt that our coaching sessions helped guide me in the right direction in areas that I needed to work on. Through that guidance and hard work I was able to improve the areas I needed to. Now I am proud to say I passed my exam! 😃</Text>< pics>

< Review>
I had a great experience with AATBS. Their program is solid and if you follow their method you WILL pass. It is hard, especially in the beginning, but you will be amazed at your growth. The BEST part was having a coach. It was  great having someone to check in with and who guided and held me accountable. Studying for the EPPP is tedious, because life does not stop. My coach was NIKKI J and she was GREAT! She was very encouraging and positive. I like structure and a plan, and she gave me that. I could email her as frequently as possible and she responded within 24hours. I passed using AATBS, and I highly recommend their program. Thank you Nikki J for your support!<//Review>

My experience with Elizabeth Price deserves 5 stars! She was an excellent help. In general though, I thought the AATBS materials were not as in depth in family systems thinking as are the FSO materials (which I also had used previously). A lot of the information on the AATBS tests focused more on individual therapy than on family systems thinking (and was not as reflective of what was actually on the test.)  I did find, however, that the ability to take so many tests, and to retake them, and see what you got wrong, was incredibly helpful.</Text>

I had Erin Elmore for my coach, and she was great! Erin was always positive, motivating, and honest with me. I appreciated the test taking strategies she taught me, how to apply them to questions, and helping me to keep things in perspective. Erin was available for weekly coaching sessions and encouraged me to reach out as needed, especially as my exam date approached. Erin definitely helped me to pass the EPPP!< /text>

I am writing this review based on the positive experience I recently had with AATBS customer service manager, Jeffrey McKee. Based on what I had originally read and understood on the AATBS website, I was not necessarily happy with my purchase. After talking with Mr. McKee, I am more than happy with AATBS services and the way in which they treat their customers and how efficiently they work to solve issues with them. Mr. McKee also worked diligently to avoid any future misunderstandings. I am in the process of studying for my test, and I have to say that the study materials I received from them are exactly what I was looking for.<//Review>

My program sent me the AATBS study materials immediately following graduation. After months of studying the materials on my own, I knew it was time to reach out for an AATBS “coach.” Dr Erin Elmore became my coach and stayed with me each week, every step of the way until I passed (first try)!  I could not have done it without her!! She was thorough, realistic, kind, and so supportive. Five months later, as a licensed psychologist, I landed my dream job. Thank you Erin!!< /review>

Nothing but HIGH PRAISE for AATBS and my coach Dr. Renee St. Jacques. The study materials and the exam were in perfect alignment. (Think about that for a second.) My coach kept me motivated and focused. "Study these subjects, in this order. Don't focus on these subjects." This was her advice. AND IT WORKED!!! WELL WORTH THE $$$$$$!<//text>

<review>The website itself is helpful for LCSW prep.  Unfortunately, the customer service, including management, is horrible.  They do not know how to accommodate for the patient, especially now since they have changed their website.  The update has messed up a lot for me, who previously had an active account prior to the update.  When I do business, I expect to be treated as if I am paying my hard earned money for it.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>I had a very positive experience with AATBS.  I only gave 4 stars because I think that the practice tests could prepare test takers better for the degree of difficulty of the exam.  I felt so fortunate to be taking the test after they added the 2 part lecture (given by Dr. Erin Elmore) which helps with learning a testing approach to the exam.  She also happened to be my coach.  I would give her 5 stars as she would go beyond what is provided in the test prep materials.  She was also so prompt and thoughtful with her responses.< /review>< rate>

There is NO way I could study for my licensure  exam on my own. The study materials are awesome, I LOVED the self-paced workshop, and, most importantly, I have a wonderful coach, Dr. Erin Elmore, who is there for accountability, support, and guidance. She is always there to provide encouragement, makes herself available for phone consultations, and assists in providing study tips and topics of focus. Anyone who is needing to hit the books, but needs a point person, I recommend AATBS and Dr. Elmore!<//text>

The workshop for the CPLEE is AWESOME!  The coach (Dr. Elmore) is very supportive, insightful, and knowledgeable. ANYONE having trouble passing this test, that is very different from the national exam, needs to take this workshop!  Coaching with AATBS has also been very helpful.</Text>

I am writing to review my experience working with Dr.Kristen Wilkinson. I signed up for coaching with Dr. Wilkinson after learning I had 90 days to take the EPPP. She walked me through every step and kept me encouraged. Dr. Wilkinson was great about letting me express my own areas I wanted to work on, but also making me aware of her own thoughts. I cannot express how much Dr. Wilkinson helped me from day one to the day I passed (on the first attempt!)! I highly recommend Dr. Wilkinson and credit her for much of my success in passing the EPPP.<//Text>

Would definitely recommend AATBS for EPPP prep. Especially the coach option is a great source of guidance and support throughout the arduous process. Dr. Rosenow was an amazing coach and would recommend her to anyone embarking the preparation for EPPP exam. Hope this is helpful!</Text>

<review>It is hard to find all of the words to describe my process with AATBS and my coach Elizabeth Price. It was solely through the materials of AATBS and Elizabeth Price, that I was able to pass the National LMFT exam, THE FIRST TIME after being out of the profession for well over a decade! WOO WHO!
Elizabeth is extremely professional and thorough, keeping me on top of things as well as encouraging me during difficult times. Thank you Elizabeth and all of the others who were involved in educating and guiding me through this process (Jennifer and Kaynor)!  If you are going to take this exam CALL ATTBS! Definitely purchase all of the materials, including Testmaster, that comes with free coaching! Other options as well to help you brush up on areas that you need it. Thank you again Elizabeth and AATBS!</review>< Pictures>

This review is for my coach Kristen! Kristen was supportive, and really changed my opinions about seeking coaching services. I was nervous to seek out coaching initially because I felt it may be a punitive process and a process that I might feel was not supportive of my own thoughts and feelings about the exam . Kristen quickly put that to rest, was supportive of my own feelings regarding the exam, and helped me come up with a plan that helped me cross the finish line to passing with the EPPP. I highly recommend working with Kristen!<//Text>

I have horrible test anxiety and tend to overthink exam questions. AATBS helped prepare me recognize what content areas I needed to focus on and importantly how to “take the test.” The coaching sessions also helped clarify questions; Elizabeth Price is a great coach! I would recommend AATBS!<//Review>

My coach, Kristen Wilkinson, is who MADE my whole experience with AATBS! I experience testing anxiety and decided to take the EPPP during a season of many personal changes. I connected with Kristen immediately over our mutual love of self-compassion research/intervention, and she was the absolute best form of support to have during my 6 month study process. She is knowledgeable, informed, down-to-earth, realistic, and earnestly helped me to create a study plan I could easily follow/believe in, which was crucial to helping me trust the whole process (grueling as it was). She kept me on track but was also a breath of fresh air, which helped me to feel grounded during the most difficult weeks of studying. She readily answered all my questions and gave me strategies that helped me go into the big day as confident as I could feel. Her help made it possible for me to pass on the 1st try!!! I couldn't recommend working with Kristen more.<//Review>

I haven't taken the EPPP yet, but I have been very impressed by AATBS. The materials are comprehensive and easy to understand. I also find the audio files helpful during commute times, in addition to the practice exams and section quizzes. Shout out to Dr. Kristen Wilkinson; she is my EPPP coach and is always super responsive, helpful, and encouraging. I take the test in 23 days (but who's counting) and with the help of Kristen and the AATBS materials I'm REALLY hoping I can put this hurdle behind me. Onwards and upwards!< /Review>

If I could give coach Erin Elmore ten stars, I would! My calls with her were incredibly helpful and I could not have gotten through this test without her!! Her wisdom, exam tips, kindness, professionalism and support meant the world to me. She normalized my feelings  and helped me with test anxiety. I'm actually going to miss talking with her!!

AATBS overall has been wonderful, I used them years ago when taking the EPPP, and now again with the CPLEE it didn't disappoint! Great customer service and tech support with the workshop as well.< /text>

I highly recommend AATBS to anyone taking the EPPP. While it is pricy, they sometimes offer discounts on their packages. The study materials and quizzes/exams contain pertinent information for the exam as well as test-taking strategies, while the coaching option helps to keep one organized and provides the support and encouragement needed to get through this process. I cannot rave enough about my coach (Dr. Wilkinson). She is just incredible! If you are lucky to get her, you will have a caring coach who goes the extra mile to provide you with guidance and help needed to prepare you for the EPPP. She helped me pass the EPPP!!!</Text>

I began my study with AATBS about 8 months prior to my exam. I had many challenges along the way (mainly life just getting in the way). However, Elizabeth Price, worked with me diligently, motivating me when I needed. We would go over questions that were worded confusing to me or unclear, review diagnoses, and ultimately get me in the right "head space" for the exam. Overall, our combined efforts (and hard work) paid off, as not only did I pass the exam on the first attempt, I far exceeded the questions required to pass. Additionally, I want to note that the preparation helped me to become a better clinician day-to-day assisting with recall and gaining a new perspective in case conceptualization. I highly recommend AATBS and Elizabeth for exam prep. Thank you for making this process much easier, motivating me, and serving as a mentor each step of the way!<//review>

The scope and depth of AATBS’s Clinical Exam Study Volumes is extensive, comprehensive, and the best I have purchased. I told my One-on-One Coaching tutor, Elizabeth Price, that I would be informing my practice using their Study Volumes for the rest of my (now) licensed career. I contracted with Elizabeth as a One-on One Coaching tutor to improve my multiple-choice test-taking skills. Her counseling with the online tests helped me considerably with that. Colleagues were skeptical of the cost, of course. Getting my MSW already cost me a mint. After that, it boiled down to how many exams did I want to buy before I passed? And, I’m in a state that doesn’t have a cap on the number of times you can take a VERY perplexing test.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I had the pleasure of being connected to Jacqueline Nienaber as my AATBS coach to help me learn test taking strategies and techniques for passing the National Counselor Examination.  From the start, I have always found Jackie to be very personable, encouraging and knowledgeable.  I utilized the AATBS books, test master mock online exams and color coded flashcards to aid in further exploration that outlined a comprehensive overview of the material needed to learn for this exam.  There were two test taking modes: study mode and exam mode that were available through the test master online exams that simulated sample questions similar to questions on the actual exam to familiarize with test content and format.  With the support, guidance and encouragement that I received from Jacqueline, I am happy to report that I passed my National Counselor Examination 8 points higher then the cutoff score. I would highly recommend the AATBS NCE study package and request Jackie Nienaber to be your AATBS coach.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I would like to offer my review of Erin Elmore as an EPPP coach.
I can only say wonderful things about her.
She was extremely helpful on all levels. With practical EPPP questions, she helped me strategize to understand the rationale for the answers to a variety of types of questions.
She helped me in managing my anxiety and in just being a sounding board for whatever I was feeling.
As someone who took the EPPP three times (and passed on the third time this past Tuesday!), Erin understood that I was immersed in studying for nearly 2 years and she was very empathetic about my frustration and exhaustion, but also commended me on my positive spirit and energy to push on.
She was not put off that I was an older student and seemed to offer real respect without any sign of ageism (which I have otherwise encountered frequently in my graduate and post-doctoral studies).
She was an extremely effective listener, showing much understanding at any given point.
Overall, having a coach who is a psychologist and has taken the EPPP herself made a huge difference.
I really cannot thank her enough (which I have done directly to her) and feel like she was a real lifeline in guiding me through this process for the past 8 months of this past nearly 2-year journey.
I hope this feedback is helpful to others. Feel free to share with Erin & with any other clients.
Thanks-

I just wanted to give a shoutout to Erin Elmore and AATBS! I spent a few weeks trying to decide what study package I was going to buy to prepare for the EPPP. After having a wonderful conversation with Brandon I was sold. The audio files and the hundreds of practice questions helped solidify the concepts I read in the books. Erin was a priceless guide throughout the EPPP journey. She was able to help me make a study plan and answered every question I had very promptly. She cheered me on, but also kept me in check when study times were hard. Having her support me made all of the difference in passing the EPPP the first time around. Thank you Erin and AATBS!</review>

<text>I just wanted to give a shoutout to Erin Elmore and AATBS! I spent a few weeks trying to decide what study package I was going to buy to prepare for the EPPP. After having a wonderful conversation with Brandon I was sold. The audio files and the hundreds of practice questions helped solidify the concepts I read in the books. Erin was a priceless guide throughout the EPPP journey. She was able to help me make a study plan and answered every question I had very promptly. She cheered me on, but also kept me in check when study times were hard. Having her support me made all of the difference in passing the EPPP the first time around. Thank you Erin and AATBS!</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

My successful completion of the EPPP exam was not direct and not at all easy. After not passing the EPPP on 2/21/18, I called AATBS to inquire about extending my testmaster access. Not passing was horrible, but the conversation that occurred with the "manager" was humiliating and nasty. However, after that, I was somehow put in touch with Erin Elmore who began coaching me out of my self-doubt and into test taking strategies and effective studying. My entire family knew that a phone appointment with Erin was a great thing. After speaking to her, I would be much more calm and centered, with a plan. Yesterday, I passed the EPPP. I'm beyond grateful for Erin's guidance and support. I truly could not have successfully navigated the past months or passed without her help! Additionally, I never would have been able to support AATBS without Erin due to the other experience. She is wonderful!!
(I also had recommended Erin to a friend/colleague who also passed the  EPPP the following week)
Sincerely,
Mary<//text>

<review>I feel that the Testmaster set of practice licensure tests really did help me earn my LICSW. The tests were not word for word what were on the tests but they got me out of thinking like my employer trained me to think and into thinking like the exam thinks and that is what I needed. They also assisted in realizing that I had deficits in areas that I did not work in. I work in mental health and so I had forgotten a lot of the children stuff that I once knew and this opened my eyes. Overall, I am not sure that I could've done it without the AATBS Testmaster set of practice exams and I do recommend them to those I consider friends.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I’ve been eating from here for about a decade. The food all around is great. I will always order the Camarones Toreados. Stuffed yellow peppers with cheese and shrimp wrapped in bacon and fried. It’s one of the best plates they have there. One tip, they offer bigger portions when you dine in, and give smaller portions to go. Not a deal breaker, and definitely hasn’t stopped me from ordering out.<//review>

Today I ordered a mundo Marino to go and when I got home and opened it. It had a nasty smell and nasty taste. I can’t believe they sold it knowing it was bad because they should know what they are serving. This place has really gone down I do not recommend.< /Review>

Excellent service and excellent food! The Mondo Mariscos was excellent. It's a cold soup of seafood such as oysters, scallops, shrimps, fish, squid or is it octopus? The fish taco was divine. I will definitely go back and bring my family and friends.</Review>

Although the interior is a bit stuffy, the good definitely makes up for that. The staff are all wonderful and attentive as well as focused to deliver 100% of the time. The wait can be lengthy if you'll be eating during peak so I would recommend waiting until the peak has passed. The food always tastes fresh and the salsa there is quite tasty as well.</Review>

Please avoid at all costs, ordered chicken fajitas.  I received fat on plate... wasn't even chicken breast... it was thigh meat but not good quality at all. Ordered a margarita and received a virgin margarita... the waitress was so rude that I couldn't even Express how unhappy I was with my meal.. spent 60 dollars of my hard earned money and it was a waste. I'm upset.

A good restaurant starts from the bottom meaning the the floors need to be spotless..tables and chair's presentable and bathrooms as well.. as restuarant owners please take pride in what ur serving and spend some money on quality and so will we...add more authentic flavors to your entrees< /review>

Servers are friendly. Pretty small space and the area is ghetto! But the food is delicious and very fairly priced! Other places with the same name charge way more! They have tvs and music. The juke box is way to loud for that little space. If you sit behind it and someone decides to play it good luck with the hearing problems. Camarin tacos are bomb.</Text>

Last time I went, I got a "world seafood marisco" and it was mostly jaiva. Not really much shrimp, octopus, or anything else. It's delicious when they make it right though.</Text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>The fish tacos aren't traditional Mexican style beer battered fish tacos. And no tartar sauce with the fish tacos.. good chips and salsa, good service. Wasn't too happy with how the ceviche tasted, also seemed a little over priced for a typical Mexican joint. Almost 5 bucks for a taco??<//text>< pictures>

horrible customer service, made mistakes on our order, flavorless carne asada, dressing for the salad appeared old, and expired. I would not recommend this place to any one, way over priced they charge $3.50 per taco for all of their tacos< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Very very bad there's always issues in this store every time I go I'm missing something they argue with me that everything's there even if you show them they still insist that they're right always missing something all the time I don't even know why I bother going still unfortunately when kids are hungry they're hungry. Don't order bacon from there it's not even heat it up they give it to you cold. And they don't give you the exact pieces they're supposed to give you very very bad customer service< /Review>< pics>

The employee was less than apologetic, borderline rude. I understand things happen but an, "Im sorry for the wait." makes some kind of difference after a minimum 10 minute wait with no explanation, just radio silence, at the menu. My oder was correct, food was good, but service left much to be desired.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

The crew is VERY polite, and they do their best.

I've been asked to pull over in drive thru once, and I had to go inside to ask about my order. Turns out they forgot about it, so I just asked for a refund.

Today I ordered the popcorn chicken with curly fries. It wasn't bad, but KFC does it better. I'd only order it again for the spicy chicken.

I didn't eat the curly fries because they were stale. Which was a bummer, the curly fries are usually always good, but these had the taste and texture of fries that were left out and then reheated 🤢 I even separated them from the chicken they were so gross

I still like Jack in the Box, but I definitely have to think about coming back to this one.<//text>

<review>Horrendous late night service, probably the worst I've ever seen from a fast food place. If i could give 0 starts i would. Either they are horrifyingly understaffed or the employees aren't qualified to work there. Over 1 hour total in line, and nearly 15 minutes before my order was taken at the mic (ONLY ONE CAR WAS AHEAD OF ME). Pretty sure the employees are purposely stalling so that people leave the line out of frustration. I would avoid this place like the plague past 10 pm or so.<//review>< pics>

We come to this location because is close to our home but to be for a fast food it is not fast ! We understand they might be short staff but to wait for more than an hour for our order and still get it wrong is unacceptable!We don't recommend coming at this restaurant after 11 pm  unless they want to wait for long time stuck in drive thru!< /Review>

Their overnight crew is just lazy, I was in line for 30 min+ at 3 am after a long road trip, get to the microphone to order and they say because they have a line they’re closing for an hour, I’ve worked fast food when it’s busy it’s not that hard just lazy workers< /text>

I was told there EBT machine was broke.
Then she said: "dinner room", and turned away. I asked her: "what you mean" ?
She would only say: "dinning room".
Finally after saying several times: "what do you mean" ?
She informed me, that the only working EBT machine is in the dining room. Then she pointed at it. Five feet away. I asked her if she could just take the card and use that machine ? She would only say: "dinning room". I explained I have disability tags on my car. I go through the drive thru because it can get very painful and difficult to walk. She said: "dinning room, thank you" and walked away.
I drove off.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1611860396213, 'text': "This is disappointing to hear, Mark.

Not big into making reviews in fast food as we all know it's just fast food but I went to this jack in the box late night when most employees are tired and not hyped to deal with public sense 75 percent are probably intoxicated at this hour but brianne had a great attitude and personality made it the best service I've had in a minute.</Review>

After going to Horseshoe Bend for the sunset, we didn't have many options for supper. We had ate at a Jack in the Box several years ago on vacation, so we gave it a try. Since we were tired, we went through the drive through. The employee who took our order was very friendly and knew Exactly what he was doing. At the window, he was even more friendly. Our order was hot, fresh and just the way we ordered it. On our last day in Page, we decided to grab breakfast on the road while traveling to the North Rim of Grand Canyon. So; we ended up back at Jack in the Box... Lets just say, I think the breakfast may have been better than the burgers! Any they have one pretty good burger!! For fast food, this joint has it going on! I wish we had one back in Tennessee.<//text>

<review>The cashier early  today at the ( Oceansie branch)   was very good with her job. She greets customers  with smile' she is courteous and respectful and most of all communicates with customers about their needs. I don't mind serving food late because she made sure it is bring attended to. Bathroom is well kept  by this guy who is very hard working,  courteous and attentive. Well trained staff.. for preparers are a little slow.</review>< pictures>

Very poor service . Seriously , messed up the complete order , had us park on the side and wait 10 minutes. I've worked in this company I know the standards and definitely this jack doesn't reach them.</review>

<Text>Not from Cali but Jack is by far my favorite fast food restaurant. The order always comes out exactly as advertised, and still perfect if I make changes to the standard meal. The employees quick with preparing my order and getting it out to me and family. The cashier's menu knowledge is outstanding! I asked about ingredients on a few different items and they always had an immediate answer! Highly impressed, always coming back!</Text>< Rating>

<review>the white cheddar bacon did not meet my expectations according to the ads
I give it a D , when it should have been an A  ,The  fries were abundant for an A , and drink was OK. I expected more from JIB marketing on this burger  , but it was a letdown .

Update :
This is to let you know I went back to this location today on 1/20 to give it another try , and give you the benefit of the doubt . i ordered 4 tacos , and a jr. bacon cheeseburger - which was fair .  when it comes to cheeseburgers , i would prefer the old style cheeseburger with the secret sauce instead on the value menu . the four tacos were so over sauced up , they were sloppy and the top of the bag was a stained mess when it was handed to me . they were too hot from all the hot sauce , to enjoy . I'm now taking another star off the rating now because of it . please don't bother to reply . this location and the one down in the valley , need to have someone from upper management run through their drive thrus as secret customers  every couple of weeks to keep the quality up .< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1574800186651, 'text': "Hi Kenneth, you should always enjoy your meal at Jack's.

I don't usually eat fast food. But once in awhile I get a hankering for a little bit this was the first time I used the drive-thru at this Jack in the Box. It was quick and easy and my food was served hot to go. Girl at the checkout counter was quite friendly and all was good.< /text>

If for nothing else, the diversity of the menu and the ability to have breakfast menu options at any time of the day, has to keep Jack at the top of the Fast Food Mountain Top. Because their HQ is here in San Diego,  I am told we are the first to get to try new menu offerings before the rest of the nation. In the end it's fast food, not fine dining.
Where else can you go and have a breakfast sandwich,  an egg roll, double cheese burger, and pancakes, at 4am, ordered at a drive thru?</text>

<Review>Warning! Deceptive practices. I ordered a #30 combo. Pancakes, eggs, sausage OR 1 slce of bacon, hash patty AND it comes with a drink OF YOUR CHOICE. Menu board read $5.29(+tax) The girl when taking my order tells me I can have both sausage AND bacon. I ask how much more is the cost "only pennies difference" so I agree.  I ask for orange juice, "oh slight upcharge for that". Then she says "homefries or extra pancakes come with that meal, which would you like?" Never have had their home fries, I choose that. When I go up to pay my bill (I am in the drive thru) my bill is $7.96! A difference of $2.10 (not including tax). I get to my office and realize I did not get the bacon and the home fries which they charged me 70 cents for is only a large tablespoon full in a side container. I called and asked to speak to a Manager. There isn't one. I'm told to come back "whenever" and they will give me my food. How did we go from $5.29 to $7.96?  The words "it comes with" means included in price but at Jack In the Box it means hit you up for more money..  "Your choice of" means, no extra charge, pick what you want. Apparently, anything other than water, coffee or coke will cost you extra. It isn't the $2.10 difference that irks me, it's the deceptive practice of how they imply it's all included. For $8.00 I can sit down at Denny's and have my meal cooked fresh. No hidden charges.
Legal battles for Jack on the future. Karma comes at a cost.<//Review>< Pictures>

I love the Oreo cookie shakes and visit Jack in the Box at least once a week to splurge on my calorie intake and treat myself to 1. The last time I was there a elderly man was ahead of me in line and when he got to the register to order he would not stop talking the cashiers ear off about everything but food. He literally would not order and would not move. For the first I kid you not 10 minutes the worker was pleasant and pretended to be interested in his one sided conversation probably because this guy seemed so lonely but as the line grew and grew the cashier finally had no choice but to turn and walk away while the man was still talking just to get him 2 get out of the way. The manager then came up and was able to quickly and efficiently take the man's order and move him aside. I was next so the manager motion for me to come up and he asked me how long I had been waiting. I told him a long time and he gave me my shake for free! After that of course I was not upset and was very happy about the way the situation was handled. Kudos to Jack In The Box and their choice of employees! I will continue to visit once a week or more depending on the success of my diet or lack thereof 😁</text>

<text>The food was great don't get me wrong. But nearly everytime I come, they mess up my order. Also, when I added more to my order, this lady with a W in front of her name (her tag was all scratched up) was complaining to the cashier for not telling her earlier what I had ordered additionally. Even though I added it on.</text></record></dataset><record>

About five tears ago, the service was good - now, it is AWFUL! The food is GREASY and frequently they give you the wrong order. And the staff are not friendly. The location is on Mission Ave in Oceanside, Ca.</review>
