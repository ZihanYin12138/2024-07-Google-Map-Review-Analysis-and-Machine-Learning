<rate>5</rate><Review>Phenomenal customer service and treatment center. I usually don’t leave reviews for businesses unless they do an over-the-top job . I came to Sherman oaks Prolase a few years ago  after having a terrible laser experience at Newlook (very rude/uneducated staff and lasers that didn’t work on me... they would make my hair turn darker and longer AFTER treatment- and yes I have light skin composure w dark hair). I decided to switch over to Prolase and have been going there ever since. Staff has always accommodated me whether I needed a last minute appointment change or cancellations, taking me even when I have come in late, super genuinely friendly staff that makes you feel comfortable throughout your whole process, well-educated nurses and not to mention great laser results! I no longer need to shave/wax/bleach my hair, 0 laser treatment incidents and feel so much more confident with my body now. Choose Prolase and you won’t be disappointed!
Thank you so much Prolase staff!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>I wish i could give them 0 star, it took 45 minutes to make an appointment with them! Then few days before my appt they called and said technician will not be there so they rescheduled me and I never ever received their call or text for confirmation! Since i was unhappy with their customer service i dudnt show up and they charged me $22.5 for no show! I never gave them my credit card info for appt! They just kept it in their system without my permission! I never suggest them! They recently become too busy and they dont care to clients! They want to make money in any f* ways they can!</review>< pictures>

Isadora is the best nurse you could ever ask for. She is very knowledgeable, patient and takes her time to provide a perfect laser treatment. The office is clean and there is no waste time for when it’s your appointment.<//Text>

<Review>I was so impressed with my experience at ProLase. It was my first time trying filler and I had Katie. She was so informative and she made me feel so comfortable. I was suprised at how pain less the experience was and the instant results were amazing but also natural looking. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know. Thank you so much Katie and ProLase.< /Review></record>

First time having laser hair removal done. Great experience here, with very nice and helpful staff. Would definitely recommend checking them out here! Always seem to have some good appointments available based on my schedule, which will really love. They are even around on Sundays! Considering having some other areas done in the future. Be sure to check out their package pricing if you need some treatments and want to save some cash.</text>

<review>I will be honest everybody results is different. This was my sixth visit every time I had a different nurse but today I had a person that deserves recognition. Her name is Caresse. Caresse goes beyond her Duty and what I mean by that is number one she reviewed very carefully my previous treatments. Number to she's been decent amount of time asking me what kind of results I am looking for. Number three she went to consult with another nurse how much she can increase the settings on a laser. Number four she was constantly asking and make sure that I'm comfortable with the new settings. After all she's very caring very compassionate employee she deserves recognition she really likes what she does. She communicates very clearly with the patients. she always ask if you are comfortable and if there is anything else she can do for you.</review>< time>

<review>My experience covers both locations in Glendale and Sherman oaks. I’m very happy with the results I had for the Botox treatment and my partner had the cool-sculpting.
The front desk people were extremely friendly especially Dolores, and when I was signing up for a package, Tony the manager was professional knowledgeable and gave us the best packages, then he helped us signing up for rewards programs. Moving on to the treatment part of the experience, Ramak was sweet professional and took the time to evaluate the areas to be treated and made sure we are comfortable. I met many injectors, but she is by far the best of the best. Her hand was light and steady.
I can’t thank you enough for the great experience and looking forward for future treatments.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c299a83aa77b5b:0xe69dd36346dd8e28</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>The CONS & PROS:
First, parking is a CHALLENGE at this location.

Secondly, today wasn't a pleasant day at Prolase. I was getting a discount package deal completed and honestly it took 27+ minutes. It frustrated me, so I stated that they should make a suggestion to those who can make a change with their system and they (both receptionist) said that's the way it is and it can't be changed...WOW (Program the system to do two items, on a single transaction; what a concept.🤔)  They did one transaction at a time with separate charges. It transaction took around 15 minutes.
Ladies don't get upset when somebody gives you their opinion or suggestions, it has nothing to do with you personally, it's not your fault.
Patronize your clients and possibly state something like "I will certainly pass on your suggestion on but sadly, as for now; there's nothing I can do."

PROS: Laser really works their "Nurses" are fabulous and professional. I'll still keep going to this location because all in all I like the service. I'll just keep my month closed.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>I went to Prolase in Sherman Oaks on June 5, 2019 to have fillers injected to make my face look fuller and wider. I was told I would see immediate results. Instead of widening my face, my cheekbones were made higher resulting in my cheeks appearing sunken in. A few days following my appointment, I called Prolase to express how upset I was with the way I looked. An appointment was made for me to see Dr Karo in the Glendale
office on June 13, 2019. Instead of fixing the problem, he told me that all the models want high cheekbones and sculptured cheeks. What do models have to do with what I want? I want a fuller face, and that's not what I got.< /review>< pics>

I had told the workers i would want a discount on my next appointment instead these people thought that it would be better to get a angry customer moreee angry they go and give my money back and tell me to go to another laser clinic. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! If women have to go through this just for a laser treatment that is very sad! I used to go to NEW LOOK SKIN CENTER and they were GREAT at the work they do I WOULD RECOMMEND GOING TO NEW LOOK CENTER THEY OFFER GREAT SERVICE AND QUALITY WORK!!< /review>< Response>

<review>I've had 3 session with my nurse Hedieh at Prolase now and she has been wonderful. I would highly recommend requesting her when setting up your appointment. She makes you feel totally comfortable throughout the process, she keeps you engaged in conversation, and she is very meticulous with her work. Most of my friends who have lasered with different companies in the past have all told me how awfully painful there experiences were, but I personally never feel any pain at all. I'm sure this has a lot to do with finding the right location with the right equipment, and the right person who knows what they are doing.<//review>< UserId.>

Professional and friendly staff. I had a great experience here, I purchased 3 packages of 3 different areas, each for 6 visits, I am now done with all 3 and I plan to return for others areas and return for upkeep in the already lasered areas.Look out for great monthly specials and lock them down by purchasing few sessions. This was a great investment!!! I am very sensitive to the touch of a raiser, nothing had helped before, it is so amazing not to shave for weeks and weeks! amazing results! word of advice, the better you deal with pain, the higher you can go on the machine and the better results you will see (I am lucky to have a high tolerance to pain, but honestly it is not that back atttt alll!)< /Text>

Your store is not $0.99 store
90% of the murchendice are between $1.99-$4.99 only 10% are $0.99 therefore you can manipulate the IRS. Other than that the employees are very nice, knowledgeable and helpful.<//text>

Admittedly,  the real reason I ever went there a 2nd time, much less the 4 Or 500th time, was a girl named Maria. She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen or known. She was always smiling,  and she would talk to you with that perfect accented broken English, and the words came out of her mouth like honey dripping out of her perfectly glossed lips. She doesn't work there any longer. She went off to college. She's gonna be someone great. Someone incredible, amazing and awesome. She is already.

I went to buy some stuff today, and one of the cashier she overcharged me. I'll go back and talk.  The cashier who overcharged me didn't apologize, and she said yes, ”I overcharged you”, ask me you to get other stuff, she said she can’t do anything.  I think, they try to scam me  Because she didn't give my money back that she overcharged, and keep afford me to buy whatever that she was charged. However, I asked her then she gave me an attitude and take very long time to give me back my money.< /Text>

<rate>4</rate><Review>I would say 5 stars except that the store POSSIBLY needs to do more checks of the parking lot which occasionally attracts not so much vagrants (which it does and are harmless) but gang types.  Now - these types are very rare and never threatened me in any way.

The very good - very good service.  The Great: Clean store with items just not found elsewhere with the possible exception of the San Leandro 'superstore.'<//Review><Name>Allan Cerf< /Name>< Date>

The place is great and Well stocked I giving a 1 star because the customer service me and my cousin went to the store and when we got to the cashier we were laughing with other customers over some funny then the cashier told us that we can’t laugh at the store and I told him that we can laugh anytime and anywhere the he started to telling other customers that he thought we were laughing at him because he was gay and even the other customers told him that he was wrong that we were laughing at something else, but he continued to treat us with attitude, I asked him for his name and he didn’t answer then he said to check the recibe, no name in there and hi wasn’t wearing a batch or anything to identify him I told him that his service wasn’t appropriate and his answer was “I don’t care “ really!!!</review>

It had items that was more than 99cents but they were of great value. So much christmas decorations, even a 6.5 foot pre lit 🎄for 29.99  you can definitely skip the big stores and shop here and meet all of your Christmas needs. Including food and tons of gifts.< /Text>

Don't expect too much when you come here. Understand how much you spend on things you buy at here. Not everything is 99cents. Occasionally you may find name brand at bargaining prices. Skip fruts because they are not that fresh or good deal than your regular grocery store.< /Review>

I haven't been to this one yet. I didn't know there was one in Pinole. Ima have to visit it soon.
I saw that sum stores carry a beer and wine selectio. Probably not in my local area.
Anyways. I'm giving 5 Stars becuz the owner read and respond to reviews.To me that says a lot.
I hope to visit ur store soon. I will update my review after my visit.

< Review>
The trainers are very friendly & accommodate to your needs. The stretches are very unique & is a great supplement.  I go to the Kearny Mesa location. The only negative is the parking lot can be a bit small but its worth going here though. I always feel a lot better when leaving. Your body is a very valuable investment. So take care of it.<//Review>

This place is the best! Very effective stretching method, easy to schedule, friendly and professional staff. Great idea if you want to improve athletic/workout performance, or if you are recovering from deconditioning, or simply if you need a stretch. Highly recommend! (PS: Stretch U technique is significantly more effective comparing to Massage Envy stretching sessions, no offence to Massage Envy)</Review>

I’ve had several different staff, and they were all consistent in their approach and skills, and put me at ease. I augment this with stretching at home to try to improve flexibility, and I’ve noticed that I move more easily and tend to carry less tension in my shoulders. I recommend the approach as a more therapeutic approach than massage, with a little bit of theory a la physical therapy. I should disclose that I’ll get a free session for posting this, though I don’t think it significantly alters my comments.</review><time>1607405251544</time><user_id>103743877472008309387<//user_id><rate>5</rate><user_name>Carla Marienfeld</user_name>< Pics>

My husband received several stretch classes as a gift. After attending the three gift classes he signed up to continue. His hip and overall his joints have been tight and the stretching has helped him to walk better and more upright. He seems to have more flexibility and is very satisfied with StretchU and all of the attendants who have stretched him.<//review>

<Name>Lovelyn Redfearn<//Name><Time>1618418138803<//Time><rating>5< /rating><review>Learned about StretchU from a co-worker of mine. I teach multiple fitness & dance classes a week, and the assisted stretch has been such a game changer. I wish I found this place sooner - but now that I have, can't imagine a week without a session. Everyone is very personable and professional. I've been stretched by 5 different people and they've all been amazing! The Kearney Mesa location is very clean, open (doesn't feel crowded and stuffy), and they take the time to wipe down the bed & wash their hands between patients. Masks are mandatory by the patient and the trainers at all times.

Memberships are the way to go & the member price on additional sessions is a steal!

Also awesome to have the option between a 20 or 40 mins session depending on your availability. I always do the 40, but can foresee needed a quick in/out sometime in the future. I also love that you can share your membership - my husband can come in and use a session when he really needs it!

Would HIGHLY recommend StretchU to all my fitness fanatics/instructors who need to level up their recovery game!</review>< user_id>

I was dubious of the stretching concept outside of a massage but find Nathan and the whole team very intuitive.  I think stretching may actually provide longer term mobility than a massage as well as pain relief.   Thanks for the team of Stretch u< /text>

<text>My dad is a retired PT, so whenever I needed stretching or therapy growing up I could just ask him.  I didn't realize how fortunate I was until I became an adult.  Doctors will prescribe PT, but usually only for an injury.
Over the years, I had developed a knot in my shoulder muscles, and when I took up running again, I found myself sorer now in my 40's, which was never a problem when I was younger.
I tried stretching out muscles on my own, but just wasn't getting a good stretch... that's when my kid's hair stylist told me about Stretch U.  Physical therapy  that I could get w/o needing a RX, just for basic stretching and PT needs.  I signed up for the membership and have been very satisfied.
My therapist, EJ does a great job!  I am feeling more stretched and limber, and my runs aren't leaving me feeling sore and tight.
I highly recommend Stretch U.< /text><Date>1603565476696</Date><Rating>5<//Rating>< Response>

<Text>After few months of being away from them due to Covid, I went back today for a session with EJ. What a pleasurable experience.
He did a fantastic job of stretching my muscles specially my injured leg without hurting anything else.
This place is amazing.
If you have an injury or just sore from sport this is a must.
All the therapists are professional and experienced.  The place is clean and organized.  I have reservations to go to therapy offices these days but not this place.

I'm new to the assisted-stretching world, having only received professional massages in the past. The stretching element has been a game-changer for me, improving my flexibility and lower back pain which wasn't really responding to massage alone. Their 40 minute session is the best, as it includes about 20 mins of stretching and 20 mins of deep tissue massage. I have used several practicioners at this facility and they have all been great - all have backgrounds in kinesiology or related fields, so they know their stuff. Highly recommend!</Review>

I began coming to StretchU with Darrough in 2018 while training for an Ultra Marathon. My former roommate recommended them for recovery post long runs and I loved it. They no doubt helped me bounce back and recover, releasing all the tightness and working to address muscle soreness and stiffness throughout my training.
Two years later and I'm down almost 150lbs from when I started coming and teaching Yoga and Primal Mobility, so I came back to release the muscle stiffness and Darrough was still there to hook me up.

With going into teaching and soon apprenticing for Yoga, I'm definitely going to be back to get worked on.< /Review>

<Review>I really appreciate what Daisy and Brandon have done for me at Stretch U Kearney Mesa.  My muscles and IT band shave been so tight.  I have had very little range of motion and standing, sitting and lying down have all been painful.  After a few sessions, I began to gain more range of motion.  They are so careful and skilled to make sure I am not in pain during my sessions.  I love my sessions at Stretch U Kearney Mesa!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<review>Finding StretchU and Darrough was a key to my physical health. I've kept up with CrossFit during this crazy year, but let my yoga practice slide, so I am getting great benefit from my stretching sessions. I appreciate Darrough's knowledge of my physical structure and my activities, as he is always able to make suggestions about how I can improve.

I usually know what I have been neglecting in my own routine, and I'm always feeling better when StretchU gets me right again.<//review><Response>None<//Response><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

I have been having a lot of trouble with both tennis elbow and knee pain, both injuries that happened at work. I have been suffering with sever pain for months and because of COVID I could not get physical therapy through my doctor. I have been seen Nate since they reopened and not only has the pain been lessening  I can finally sleep through the night.<//Review>

StretchU has helped me tremendously! The staff  are very professional and the facility is clean. I wasn’t sure at first if this was for me, now I’m so glad I found this gem. I’ve recommend StretchU  to many friends on FB and beyond.</text>

Been going regularly for a few weeks now and I love it. My body has started to feel a difference and less tight muscles throughout the body. I've been stretched out by different people and each person has been great.<//Text>

This is a great service at affordable prices. I'm very active & like to keep fit but am fairly prone to muscle injuries. This is a great addition to my own stretching & massage appointments to help stave off those injuries. Worth every penny!< /Review>

Stretch U is an excellent choice for anyone looked to add assisted stretching to part of their fitness or recovery routine. All of the physical therapists that I've worked with have been excellent and have provided truly therapeutic recovery. If you are feeling sore from sports, working out, or just life in general you should definitely visit Stretch U and take an intro session to find out what it's all about - you won't be sorry that you did!</text>

My son Christopher had his session with Alexis and he loved the way she stretched and massaged his problem areas. She took the time to asked him questions and then stretched him. He left feeling relaxed and not tight on one side. She was amazing and I recommend that everyone that needs to be stretched book an appointment with Alexis at the Kearney Mesa location.<//text>

It's been a few weeks since I've had a treatment but my body is screaming for a session. The fact that these guys have degrees in a specialty which involves the movement of the body is a very comforting thing to me. They do great work. If I could afford it I'd be in there twice weekly.</review>

So far I have had 5 stretch sessions. I have been concentrating on my lower body and am working on loosening up my hips. Stretch U has been great in helping me achieve my goals. It has helped me improve my Pickleball game.
In fact, two of my Pickleball partners commented to me that there was a noticeable improvement in my game since I started my stretch sessions.
I enjoyed all my sessions and the people working on me have been great!

I am a certified massage therapist and I think everyone would benefit by including Stretch U in their self care plan. I started last December taking my 15 year old son for his tight hamstrings. I wanted him to avoid injuries and improve his range of motion. I observed the great technique and breadth of knowledge exhibited by the staff and decided to try it for myself. I signed up for the 40 minute stretch and found I also could benefit from assisted stretching. We are considering a monthly membership because it’s so relaxing and beneficial to experience even the 20 minute stretch. Definitely worth the short drive from
Downtown to Kearney Mesa!</text>

I've really been loving my weekly sessions. I teach fitness and I was struggling with finding time to properly stretch and give my body the recovery needs to perform at it's best so this has been a really great fit for me.

There's plenty to parking and the staff is super friendly and really take the time to explain everything during their first intro session.

I live DT so I try to fit my appts in to avoid traffic coming back but it's easy since they offer a wide range of times every day.< /Text>

I had always been intrigued by the idea of a stretch therapy session. I read the reviews here and was skeptical because people talked about being cured of pain. I thought might as well just try and see. Won't hurt to give it a shot.

My appointment with Derrick was great. He explained everything and made sure pressure was good. After I felt great but was wondering if the relief from my chronic low back pain would last. I've had massages before and the relief only lasts a day or two then pain comes back.

A week later I still felt AMAZING and the best I had felt in years. Not exaggerating when I say this place worked wonders on me. I'm a wedding photographer and had so much pain by hour 3-4 and now that I visit twice a month, I can get through hour 8 with almost no pain. It's incredible. I thought I'd always be in pain but no more

That first visit seemed to cure my pain and now I just go as maintenance and a sort of prevention of extremely tight muscles. I workout several times a week (now with no back pain holding me back!!!) and these visits really help me stay loose and able to progress through my workouts.

I highly recommend stretch u to anybody who has tried other methods of pain relief, especially pain of unknown origin. It works wonders for me and I will keep going in for the foreseeable future!!<//review>

The San Marcos location is a bit far for me, but luckily they have two locations near me - Kearny Mesa & Rancho Bernardo.  In my own experience, StretchU is a combination of physical therapy and acupressure massage.   It's effective in reducing injuries in sports and those who live active lifestyles.

The more I workout and lose weight, the more I need to stretch. The key, I think, is stretching correctly. Stretch U is just the thing.  Like a massage, a lot of it is passive, meaning the technician stretches you.  I've been stretched 3 times now after a workout and I'm already feeling the difference in my muscles.  Give it a try after your next workout!!<//text>

<Review>My experience with Stretch U was fabulous!  Cobi is experienced, knowledgeable & able to fine tune his technique to the needs of his client!  He applied perfect pressure, distance & time to each stretch which was beyond what I can do, on my own, at Yoga or workout.  I left the session feeling full of energy & vitality!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Kobi is an EXCELLENT Stretch Therapist (my description). He is extremely knowledgeable about stretching and is constantly adding to his repertoire of techniques.  He is very attentive to a client's needs.

The only challenge is the restriction GROUPON is now enforcing where you can't utilize more than one of Strech U's Groupons in one year. Truly an unfair and cheap instance that reveals how stingy GROUPON can be, especially after making more than $194 million in 2016.</Text>

My child was diagnosed for a early onset of nearsightedness and since both myself and my wife had been wearing eyeglasses and contacts due to nearsightedness I wasn’t too worried until Dr. Yen told me that nearsightedness isn’t just an inconvenience anymore but am epidemic and that nearsighted kids will have tougher times in school to see and learn without struggling but also their conditions can become a medical health issues as more nearsighted individuals get eye diseases like glaucoma and things that can blind a person for life! Luckily for us, Dr. Yen happened to be specialized in a nearsighted control method that helped kids and even adults who hates wearing glasses or contact lenses to achieve great visions.  My family are able to see first hand what this great technology was able to treat and aid our vision demands.  Thanks Dr. Yen and your team on behalf of my family!< /Review>

This past summer, around July, 2020, I made the huge mistake of ordering glasses from Lucy Yen.

When they came they were the wrong model and did not fit. So I got my money back in October, which was a long arduous process with the credit card company.

The credit card company, after ruling in my favor, allowed Dr. Yen 3 months to appeal the decision, but she didn't.

Now today on March 16th, 2021, Lucy Yen has sent me multiple threatening and insulting emails and texts, one of which has an "invoice" for the glasses and stated that it has gone to "collections".

Very distressing. Hopefully the police can resolve this tomorrow. A few minutes ago I tried to file a report online, but found that it has to be done over the phone between noon and 4pm Monday through Friday.<//text>

<text>This Optometry optical shop is a real gem. They carry real quality and locally made products unlike some national chains that have basically the same stuff that are not unique or quality enough. I support local business that strives hard to provide quality products and services. The staff and doctor are also very friendly and they always go above and beyond to address concerns. Definitely recommend for best eye care found in the area!</text>< Pictures>

The optometrists are so kind and thorough and really explain everything super well so that I could even understand what “Vitreous detachment” meant and it didn’t freak me out!! Dr. Yen is the best!!</review>

I requested an appointment online on their website and was called and got an appointment for that same day. Dr. Yen' and the other staff were all very kind, and the eye exam was quick and easy. Their location, previously Oakridge Mall (they moved but still nearby), is pretty convenient too. I'm glad to have found them.< /text>

Dr. Yen's and staff are amazing. I have been going to Eye Luv Lucy Optometry for many years and I look forward to seeing them every year. Super friendly and easy to work with. They are so much better than the chain eyecare places at the mall. They definitely have a customer for life!!</Review>

< Review>
Avoid this place. Please read my comments below for reasons.

Short Story: Our insurance company is VSP. We received multiple confirmations from the front desk staff that "yes we are in network for VSP" before I start the eye exam and before I swipe my credit card. It turns out that they are not in network, and now they are playing dumb and insist on telling me to reach out to the insurance company to get reimbursed.

Long Story

We visited this store on 10/08/2020. Before we started the eye exam, they confirmed that my insurance works and should cover, so my wife and I went ahead and did the eye exam. The service seems to be pretty good, the doctor was patient in answering all my questions. However after we select the lenses and frames, we were told that they will charge the full amount without insurance adjustment, so that's over $2000 for both of us, and they will file claim forms to the insurance company for us so we can get reimbursed by the insurance company later. This makes me feel suspicious because the stores I visited in the last few years usually will directly calculate the amount that I should pay based on my insurance policy, rather than asking me for the full amount. So we asked again, "are you sure you are in network?" The front desk staff seems to be confused so she went inside and talked to the doctor, and came back telling us "yes we are in network", "no worries, you are covered". So I went ahead and made the purchase. Overall we think the service was pretty good so we even recommended this place to our friends.

On 10/29/2020, we went to the store to pick up the glasses. We were happy with the service so far and I ordered my second pair of glasses. Before I made the purchase, I asked again "are you sure you are really in network for VSP? this is a lot of money", the answer from the front desk staff was the same "yes we are in network". We left the store happily.

On 11/3/2020, we received the explanation of benefits from my insurance company. It states that the store is not in network so I'm only eligible for out of network coverage. I felt suspicious so I called the insurance company to confirm. The insurance company said “they are not in network. we can file a complaint for you as it seems that they lied to you about it, but unfortunately we cannot do anything else". I reached out to Eye Luv Lucy immediately, they pretended to not understand what I'm talking about and kept telling me to "talk to the insurance company to get what you are supposed to be reimbursed. Our job is already done." They don't pick up my phone calls any more. Luckily they have a number to receive messages so I can still send the messages.

On 11/6/2020, I sent messages indicating that if they don't offer a satisfactory solution, I might have to start writing negative reviews and think about going to court.

On 11/7/2020, I received a phone call from their manager. The manager was very reasonable. He came prepared, with receipts for 3 pairs of glasses, with detailed calculations of how much I should get refunded as if they were in network. I'm happy with this resolution. The manager said he would communicate with the owner to decide, I should get a response within days.

On 11/17/2020, they finally replied back to me with their decision. They said that “your insurance is responsible for reimbursing you. No one in our office claimed to promise that you paid zero even with with in network benefit. At this point, we can offer you credit toward 2 pairs of glasses that you paid forward as a courtesy”. I declined this resolution because I believe they lied to me about that they are in network, why should I cover the cost? The insurance company has no fault. Why should I continue to come to a store with no integrity?

Final words

Eye Luv Lucy, If you treat your customers fairly, they will keep coming, and introducing more customers. It seems that you do not share the same philosophy. That's fine. I would have to take whatever measures to defend myself.<//Review>

During COVID shelter in place, I just ran out of contact lenses. My regular optometrist office was completely closed so I panicked and started calling local office that’s near me. I was able to get through to a person soon at Eye Luv Lucy Optometry. Although they told me they also observed COVID protocol, they had many patients or customers wanting to get their prescription filled so they can see!! I was scheduled in to see the doctor pretty quickly and the process was extremely smooth plus, I was given extra contacts to help me through until my ordered lenses came in.  The office receptionist even called me days after to ensure I was still doing ok with my lenses and wished that I stay safe.  I feel cared for and that was the best feeling I had. Absolutely recommend this office and their services to anyone!</text>

<text>Eye Luv Lucy carries different type of unique brands of frames and I happen to like what other places don’t carry.  They are very patient to explain when I didn’t know certain brands or if I ask for a styling questions such as what looks good for me. I never feel more attended to or cared for in the past. The sales people are very experienced and go above and beyond my expectations. Prices are very reasonable as well!< /text>< pics>

3 weeks ago I booked an appointment with Dr. Yen's office as a new customer and was quickly admitted.  The facility has very latest eye exam machines and I even get to see a picture of my own eyes that I never knew before which is super awesome.  Dr. Yen took some time to detail me on what my change of prescription is and what types of lenses would be suitable for my work as I get frequent headaches and didn't know what until Dr. Yen told me it was strictly from overusing my computer without taking break or not having the right type of lenses for computer screen.  I later went and order my  new lenses and just picked them up last week.  I tried the new lenses over the whole week and magically my eye strain decreased and I even feel that my head is much more clear at work through my lenses.  I am so thankful of what Eye Luv Lucy Optometry did for me.< /review>

<Text>I came from Salinas area and was visiting friend in San Jose then I was walking in downtown Willow Glen.  While walking, my sunglasses suddenly snapped off on the side so I was desperate to find a place to help  me fix it. It was Saturday afternoon and I found Eye Luv Lucy Optometry.  I was quite intrigue by its eclectic flare of the storefront and the good looking eyeglasses displays.  I went inside to make sure I can get some help on the spot.  The receptionist immediately greeted me and saw the broken frame on my hand.  She told me to look around while  she get it fixed.  Within 5 minutes, she put the broken part together and told me luckily it was just a missing screw and she was able to find a matching screw.  She even polished my lenses and frame to look like new when she gave them back to me.  But since I was there and another pair of sunglasses attracted me, I decided to purchase it.  The brand is called IVI which I never heard before but she told me it was German Zeiss lenses, manufactured in Italy by a California designer.  Since I never heard of it but I always love unique and quality sunglasses, I decided to get them.  I am completely happy with my experience and the quality of products this shop carries.  I will be back again!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<time>1537991230699</time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>I have wonderful experience with this local Eye care practice.  Their selections are so unique and even though many are designer frames, their prices are very reasonable. Service is superb as I was given much more time with the doctor (Dr. Yen) and her staff, more than any other offices I have been to. They kept asking if I have questions they can answer and I know they truly care for my experience and my satisfaction and they seem to want to address their customer problems or concerns before they leave. Absolutely my best experience! Highly recommended.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Dr. Yen gave us an excellent eye exam that is very thorough and educational.  Normally I just go to the optometrist and get my prescription only but no one ever explain to me what they were testing for.  Dr. Yen not only take time but she tried to explain each step what she’s doing and why and I even get to see the inside of my eyes first time through digital photo which I was amazed.  Overall, great experience.< /Text>

It was time for our yearly eye exam and since I was new in the area, I searched google for a location nearby. This place came highly recommended so I ventured out to give them a try.  The ambiance is very clean and modern also the staff and the doctor were all very professional and on top of their game.  I normally didn’t care for going to a doctor appointment of any kind but this place gave me some very pleasant experience I didn’t have before as a patient and customer.  I ended up getting what they recommended as the optician was so good at his trade and I also was pleased with the look which many people commented and praised.</Text>

<Name>Natalia Boleyn</Name><text>I was visiting from out of town and came across this unique eyeglasses shop. It is a boutique so they don’t have any common brands like Ray Ban or Oakley but they have lots of handmade and limited items which is a true eye opener.  They are so beautiful and stylish and I ended up getting some sunglasses which I am happy to wear everyday as I didn’t look like everybody else.  Highly recommended for those that want to get out of the same old same old and for great quality reasons.< /text>< user_id>

Eye Luv Lucy is very unique.  The office looks fresh and modern but very retro too.  The selections of eyeglasses are not so boring like what I see in other places.  I can finally see something different here that I can enjoy and not looking like another person that shopped at the mall.  This place is tasteful and fresh.</text>

<Review>This boutique eyeglasses shop is very unique. They don't have what everyone else carries which I know are cheap products from China, including Ray Ban that I used to love. They have great quality eyeglasses that are handmade and are from Europe, such as Germany, Denmark, France and Spain which aren't the cheapest but the best for sure.  You can even order real diamond and gold in their glasses which cannot be done on cheaper eyeglasses.  That is just awesome!< /Review><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Recently I came visit my relative in San Jose and came across this boutique eyeglasses shop.  I was just browsing and was greeted by the gentleman that is professionally dressed and very nicely asked if I needed help.  I told him I probably could use his help for recommendations on styles as it has been so long since I shopped for eyeglasses.  He then looked me up and asked some life style questions then went to pick some super stylish eyeglasses and sunglasses.  I couldn’t believe that everything he picked were very fitting as I would never picked them myself just looking at it. He acted professionally and very spot on for styles that look good. It was a very personal and pleasant experience. I will tell all my friends about them!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I am a student and into soccer.  In fact I play for school team and very competitive.  I got my eye exam first time for the summer and realized that I have to wear glasses, not just for school but also for protection.  After a thorough eye exam by Dr. Yen, I purchased some really cool protective glasses that even turned dark when I go in the sun as sunglasses.  I never thought glasses could do so much.  Not only I could see better but function better.  Best of all, I got some quality education on how to take care of my eyes as no one has told me before.< /review>

The service was professional, friendly and timely.  I got new progressive lenses in one of my old frames, since I wasn't qualified for a new frame yet according to my insurance policy.  Dr Yen was willing to kindly accommodate that. The new lenses help me much, especially driving at night.  I think it's definitely worth the money to get high quality lenses, since I wear them all the time except sleeping.  Thanks Dr Yen and staff!< /review>

<Review>I came to this office because I was having blurry vision and didn't have my eyes checked for years.  Then with the eye scanner, I found out my prescription jumped almost twice!  Doctor took tremendous time with me to reassure me that although this type of change is not typical for an adult, she simulated my new script and it was night and day.  Dr. Yen has excellent bedside manner and always patient to answer my questions repeatedly until I understand.  I was a bit shocked how bad my vision was but eventually I got a great quality frame and blue light blocking lenses to help protect my vision and enhance my visual experience.< /Review>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Recently I was due for contact lens check up and found this boutique optometry shop.  I have very complicated prescription that it's hard to get right.  With Dr. Yen, she made my otherwise very tedious experience with getting the right contact lens a very smooth ride.  No one in the past got it right the first try and she didn't even need to know what I had before.  Now I see great and extremely comfortable in my new contact lens.  I ended up getting a pair of also very beautiful and comfortable sunglasses to go along with my new contact lenses.  They gave me an excellent pricing on that pair of sunglasses since they are 100% UV block which is essential.  Overall a positive experience.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Best boutique eyeglasses shop there is in this area.  Most places sell the same things and although there is nothing wrong with that but it just gets boring after a while. I am a neighbor and comes by this retail frequently and it seemed that they refresh their stocks often.  I finally got a pair of prescription glasses and I get so much compliments that I feel like I should get paid for each referrals I sent them...lol< /Review>

She's the best, most technical, caring optometrist I've know in my 50 years of  wearing corrective lenses.   She sells the most dashing eyewear.   She really knows her stuff.   The equipment she uses is the most up-to-date in the field.   I really trust her.

Please visit EYE LUV LUCY OPTOMETRY every year for the most accurate and Comprehensive exam for eye care!

I have the best experience with Dr. Yen's team.  I came because I was having some eye pain for days and got worse. I couldn't wait anymore and on Saturday, it was hard to find some clinic open but luckily I called and Dr. Yen answered right away.  She is extremely professional, courteous and spot on with her treatment and her recommendations to my condition.  I had an eye infection but was treated immediately and my comfort came right away.  I am thankful my eyesight is saved and I could have a relaxing weekend after all.</review>

I took my son to Dr Yen for eye check up.  He had eye allergy so Dr Yen recommend to get over the counter eye drop for his allergy relief.  My son felt better after applying few eye drops.

Thanks for the advice.

Highly recommend !<//Text>

< Review>
I love this boutique Eyewear store. I tried to find something different than other shops around and I was not disappointed.  The optician receptionist was so knowledgeable about the lenses that I had no idea about before. Not only I found something very unique and fashion forward (European styles mostly) but I got the top quality which I enjoy tremendously</Review>

< review>
Dr. Yen gave me the most thorough eye exam ever.  I came in because I was overdue for eye check up and recently I had very bad headaches from overusing my eyes.  I wanted to make sure there was no vision issues.  Dr. Yen and her staff did a fabulous job in checking all aspects of my eyes and showed me my new glasses prescription that was stunning.  I never saw so clearly before and that’s also how I learned I was missing out in the vision I wanted all along. After receiving the glasses I ordered, I just couldn’t put them down as now not only headaches disappeared but I can see so well that I am just so impressed.< /review>

I took my daughter in for a check up and the experience was wonderful. Dr. Yen was very helpful and was able to convince my teenager to not look at her IPad so much, and it WORKED! Eye Luv Lucy has so many interesting artisan frames that are not found in just any stores. They are so unique and fun to try on. Love Dr. Yen and her store!<//Review>

What large assortment of designer frames and after viewing all the options the Dita frames are by far the best frames to date.  Dr. Lucy was extremely patient but found me the right look and lens.  She is the best Optometrist in Silicon Valley.</text>

<review>My daughters and I have been seeing Dr. Yen for past two years. Her office stuff were friendly and professional. They helped us pick the frames that would fit our needs and also with a flare of fashion. One of my daughter had CRT from Dr. Yen's office. We didn't have to go through many pairs until the right one is identified.
Dr. Yen has been phenomenal. She's very thorough and professional. I'm impressed with her work. She was the one spotted the problem with my daughter's eye problem which our previous doctor didn't even notice. She referred my daughter to a specialist which took care of her eye problem right away. Thank you Dr. Yen.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rate>5< /rate><Name>jenny chang</Name>< Response>

< review>
Absolutely the worst experience that I have ever had. Lucy tried to tell me I was seeing a certain way. Which makes no sense because they are my eyes. And then she overcharged me, didn't inform me of specific payments that I had to make so that she could cheap me out of money. My insurance ended up paying me back because of how horrible she was to me and she ended up giving me free contact because she realized I caught her in her lies. I would NEVER go back here and I think that she sshould have her license taken away< /review>

The kids and I have been going to Dr. Lucy since she opened a couple few years ago.  Initially it was the name that pulled me in, but now it's the service.  Appointment times have been convenient, as well as the location, right in the neighborhood. Our exams are quite thorough and her rapport with the kids can't be beat.</text>

<Date>1433138141375</Date><rating>5<//rating><text>I had just took my wife to Lenscrafters to return the pair of prescription shades she got there.  The order was delayed for over 1 month, and when we finally got the glasses, they were super thick, a lot thicker and heavier than we expected.  They looked awful on her, so we decided to return them to Lenscrafters.  I asked my friends at work, who are mostly geeks who stare into the computer all day, and I asked them about where they get such thin glasses for their very near sighted eyes, and they pointed me to Eye Luv Lucy.  Their cute and creative name is not just skin deep, and they really do live up to that high level of uniqueness and creativity.  They had top caliber frames, many of which are unique and professional, even more importantly, they have the best thin lenses I could find in the bay area.  My wife is over 1000 degrees near sighted, I don't know the actual number, since she says its a secret.  Anyways, it's hard to get my wife into the optometrist office since she is super near sighted and for all her life, she has had the impression that her prescription sunglasses would be thick and heavy.  We were really impressed by Dr. Yen's skills in producing a unique pair of shades which look great, and are quite thin and light.  They have many hard to find artisan eyeglass frames, and they can make great lenses to go with the frames.  While I was there, I even found shades for my four month old twin girls, and those shades are made in France, very different than the junk stuff you find at toy stores or drug stores.  I was quite impressed with the stellar service, and they took care of the insurance paper work, so I had a good experience.  Dr. Yen is a warm, enthusiastic person who takes good care of her patients.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I have a background in optics, and perhaps because of that, I am highly bothered by eyeglass lenses with high distortion and high chromatic aberration. Dr Yen was the only optometrist that understood what I was talking about and took it seriously--maybe the other doctors understood me too but thought it wasnt important. Anyway, she ordered a special brand of lenses for me and the aberrations are really small. Really happy with these lenses, although they're a bit on the heavy side.<//review>

<Review>I have never tried transition lenses and did not even care for sunglasses before I came to Eye Luv Lucy Optometry.  I didn't even know that sunlight is not healthy for the vision, until Dr. Lucy examined my eyes and said I am at risk for cataracts already at age 40 something.  I was devastated about this fact and frustrated that no one else in the past told me about this.  I always thought sunglasses are for the vain people and no one could persuade me to even try.  I was very much humbled from my interaction through Eye Luv Lucy plus their sunglasses are so comfortable to wear, with the best material available, like titanium, stainless steel etc.  I am a nerd and did not care for fashion but I am sold on the solid quality of the products at Eye Luv Lucy Optometry. It is really the best in town.< /Review>< user_name>

Eye Luv lucy optometry is a gorgeous shop with most update to date equipment.  I have my eye examined by their digital machine that is much more accurate than the manual machines in the area.  Dr. Yen is also extremely knowledgeable on all medical terminology and generous to share. I learned that using electronics excessively can lead to macular degeneration from blue light (emitted from cell phone and smart device etc) so I ordered the best blue-light blocker and am so pleased that I now feel secured in the lenses plus I can see so much better without my eyes get tired so easily anymore!!</review>

<Text>I dreaded coming to doctor's office all of my life, especially eye doctors due to how bad my eyesight is.  I came to consult with doctor Yen as she is in my area and also because Eye Luv Lucy Optometry is so daring from passing by.  Then my whole concept about four eyes were changed completely.  I didn't know how much fun I could have with eye glasses and how far have those eyeglasses materials came.  Stainless steels, woods, cottons, titaniums.  I tried on a pair of Lindberg that are perhaps the lightest weight frame I know of and they are super comfortable for a heavyset eyesight as myself.  The staff plus the doctor helped me look up the best fit and chose what worked best with my type of prescription.  It was simply amazing.  I still can't believe how comfortable and beautiful the glasses can be!</Text></record>

<review>Worst eye doctor I've ever been too. Extremely rude Dr. and employees.  They sell over priced glasses that have the coating wear off after a few months.

-Groupon deal was messed up, paid about 4 times from what I expected
- One side of the glasses made everything look like sideways (hard to explain)
- Took them to fix
- Got the (fixed) glasses back, made me dizzy, had to force my eyes a lot.
- Had a trip to Spain and got them perfectly  fixed again for a very small ammount.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>first of all I want all of my followers to understand that this is probably the most fresh amazing sandwiches that I have had yet. This is one of those little hidden gems that everyone needs to try. The customer service is outstanding. The sandwiches are on point!!  if you're in the area on Madison avenue I recommend if you're hungry for a perfect sandwich you need to try this little spot. Grub hub delivers!!!</Review>< gmapID>

UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!!!

The owner seems really nice and business-oriented. He knows some of the history of the shop and his employees were on top of their game.

Got my food promptly and the order was correct so I'm very happy!

Be looking for a new site and facebook... a little birdie told me it's getting an upgrade< /review>

My second time going there and very satisfied with the experience. The food is always great and the employees are very welcoming. I needed a recommendation and the staff were more than happy to help me out. The selection is fairly large and if you want something different, just ask. I will definitely be going back there again.< /text>

The sub I had was delicious. They use fresh cut, thick items, not just your regular deli slices. The sub I had was a little too saucy but overall really delicious. It's in a small plaza and there are a couple tables outside and lots of 2-4 person tables inside.< /text>

<review>Called in an order for two sandwiches for my first visit.  Very polite service and staff.  The sandwiches were quite good and the ingredients were fresh.  I got the turkey club and the mad sub and I highly recommend both.  Thank you for the experience.</review>< pics>

<Text>Great sandwhich's  Mad Sub usually is not too busy. High quality food at fair price. Staff is always smiling and friendly. Location on Madison Ave near Auburn Blvd is easy to get in and out of. I would recommend to anyone who hasn't been there yet to give em a try. Your taste buds and stomach will thank you.
Mad subs is a great alternative to all the fast food eateries out there.< /Text>< user_id>

However, the 2 girls behind the counter rocked it. Zipping around, slamming out orders and making sure everyone was satisfied. The girl with the shorter red hair(didn't catch a name) was especially amazing!! Funny and keeping the chaos light.

My first time at this spot, and definitely won't be my last.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< GmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>This is the best sandwich shop I've been to North of Sacramento. It's family owned and operated, smokes/cooks it's own meat, and I always leave blown away by the variety of flavors. The new ownership really adds a special touch to an already superior product. I definitely recommend trying them out or giving them another shot if you haven't been in a while.< /review>< pics>

I was hoping this would be good food when I went. Unfortunately, it was mild typical deli food. Nothing interesting. Nothing notable. The bread, the cheese, the meat, etc... Was like a grocery store deli. Except it cost more. No talent. No flavor.<//Review>

Oh yeah! This is definitely a good sandwich spot. I recommend you grab the Tall Skinny Matt on Dutch Crunch. The one problem with this restaurant is that the eating area is very shabby. All in all, if you have a lunch break stop on by, their sandwiches are great.< /Text>

Best subs in Sacramento! Seriously awesome subs. Friday and Saturday they have tri tip! It goes fast so get there early so you can get some. Super friendly staff are very fast, the quality is great and the portions though look small will fill you up.< /review>

Mad Subs has great food and great service! This is not a subway, so it does take a little time for the hand-crafted subs to be prepared, but the results are worth the wait! Delicious and super filling!</Review>

3.5 stars overall. If you're in the area and looking for a sandwich to eat this is definitely one to try. I've had better but this is up there at the top and obviously way better than any of your Subway/Togo's type sandwiches. I deducted half a star because once I got home I realized they forgot to add in the delicious cookie included with my sandwich.<//text>

Best sandwhiches in the area. I had the Chicken Rancho on (requested) Dutch roll bread. The bread was so soft with that crunchy Dutch style. Perfect combination of ingredients. I made it simple and had everything on it, fml.. it was perfect.< /text>

This place is amazing! I have always been a chips and sandwich girl. I never buy sandwiches if I can't afford chips. I put my chips back in the bag because this sandwich couldn't get any better. I'm also a person who almost always alters my orders. This sandwich was perfect as is. Another first! These people really know what they are doing and are so friendly without being over the top about it :) I'm going to spread the word and definitely come back to try something else.< /review>

My employee has been raving about this place so we finally made it for lunch today. The sandwiches are large and very good. I had the "Hot Mel" which is chicken breast, American cheese and barbecue sauce. Sometomes barbecue sauce can be overpowering but this was mild with jist the right amount of flavor. My employee loves the "Jesse James" so much he never tries anything else out. They add a small cookie to every meal which I thought was a nice touch. I will definitely be back!<//text>

<Name>Lyrpa024< /Name><Text>Umm yeah, this place has gone WWAAAYYY down hill since it has had new ownership. 40 minute wait for our 2 sandwiches... I loved this place when I was a student at ARC. I'm a little more than dissapointed with it. I came in with high expectations, and walked out knowing I'll probably won't ever go back.
I had to go back and remind them to put the Avacado on my sandwich which I ordered from their menu, plus my sandwich was greesey... With Pesto? It wasn't a pesto sandwich. That super confused me. I think there prices are too much too, but sure they and a stamp card, so that's cool I guess. But now I don't think that I want to go back after this experience.
Its a tiny place and a little dirty & messy, there was leaks like everywhere. Under the soda machine and in the bathroom. Boxes in the hallway and in the bathroom. Kinda gross.
I guess what I'm saying is try it if you dare... =/</Text><Rate>2<//Rate>< Date>

Fast and friendly service and fantastic food, they must have at least three dozen different sandwiches you can choose from. If you like it hot try The Red Rooster</Text>

<Text>New owner doesn't know how to keep things in stock or how to train employees. The sandwich I got was divided into left side meat, right side veggies, not in layers. Once made the girl didn't even know how to wrap it properly, and it almost got into the bag half unwrapped except I told them about it and demanded they fix it. This was the most disappointing sandwich I've ever had, and nearly the worst experience in a store. It doesn't help that they don't have any chips in stock when I went either. I've been a couple times after the change in ownership and I've been disappointed each time. Never going back.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Very wide selection of menu items and you get a lot of food for the price. There's a wait around lunch time, but it's worth the wait.</review>

<text>Very much toward the expensive side, average sandwich, drink with chips will set you back about 12$ to 16$. Fyi, go to anywhere else and pay less for more....< /text>< response>
{'time': 1500985495491, 'text': "We're sorry you feel that way about our sandwiches, Edward. We take pride in using the freshest ingredients when we prepare our sandwiches, and it's upsetting to hear you're not a big fan.

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>Horrible experience! They only had one person making sandwiches and working the register. With line when I went to pick up my online order. Got there 5minutes early and 10 minutes later my order hasn’t even been started. Owner needs to step it up with help for this poor girl working her butt off. She had a great personality so I know she’s awesome but who ever is running this show you should get another job or run a different type of business.</Review>< user>

This place used to be good when they had some older ladies  working here that I don’t see as much anymore.  They were nice and listened and got my order right. now they have these two younger girls who can’t be bothered and It seems like their job is the biggest inconvenience 🤷🏽‍♀️.I used to enjoy coming to this location when the older ladies were working when I’d come in.
Working sucks and I used to work in food, if you don’t like it find a new one that is more tolerable or at least don’t take out your annoyance on your customers.< /Text>

<text>Previous female employees that spoke Spanish don't seem to be working there anymore.  Worst sandwich ever made at Subway.  I have been to many Subway shops since 1990.  This one particular location I have been going to for lunch for the past year.  Service is not as welcoming.  Food quality was so bad I had to take a photo.  No napkins.  Sandwich had way too much mayo and mustard.  Probably lloked better while digesting then after having been served.  I  do not recommend this location until serious training is provided again to new staff or better yet bring back the staff that took their job more serious.</text><Rating>1<//Rating><date>1583992260085</date><pics>None</pics><gmapID>0x808e331c0e76a4c7:0x99103e01d9cc7cb3<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Coworker that is pregnany was there to pick up a online order for lunch and was never given the food. When she entered she was never greeted and after almost 15 mins they finally approached her to ask what she needed. Why have an online system to order if your order wont be ready.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Yesterday I went to buy 3 footlong, well when I entered I had time that I did not eat Subway so the store smelled so good and I savored the sandwich under the mask! When I got to my house in the first bite I felt that something was not right ... it was the bread, it seemed that it had several days! All chewy! And how is a chewy bread going to be if I even asked for it extra toasted? And now I have a stomachache and diarrhea. Horrible

Y como va a estar un pan chiclosoo si hasta lo pedi extra tostado?? Y ahora estoy con dolor de estomago y diarrea. Horrible</review>

It's a huge burst of cool points to San Diego for having so many awesome hiking trails interwoven throughout the city and suburban areas. The canyons are amazing, but be careful. Bring a buddy. There are sometimes scary people lurking down there. The scenery is very unique, and I always get some great pictures while down there.< /Text>

A very nice Oasis in the middle of an urban neighborhood.  Restoration and trail make it a pleasant place for a walk.</Review>

Absolutely phenomenal! Needed a hard to find screw and they had exactly what I needed, when other big name places didn't.  They have definitely earned my business.  Staff was great and extremely helpful. This will be my first stop when I need anything like this again.</review>

And when I needed only 4 which would've been a dollar and I only had card to pay with they let me take them with a promise to only leave a great review. I found a dollar in my car but the thought of them saying just take it was phenomenal. I couldn't praise them more. I always find what I need here. One million stars!</text>< response>

First time going to this place and had a terrible experience with one employee's actitude, the older guy who works there with a long beard was so rude, I went to this place looking for some screws, and after having the bad experience with the employee, I would never go back!!!! This employee needs some training about customer service..</Text>

<Text>They close from 12:00-1:00. Make sure to check that before you make the trip. Or just feel free to pee on their wall while you wait..

Amazing ship! 10/10, the whole Owl House fandom adores it. We love the LGBTQ+ rep, thank you for making this your title, including the cheek kiss. That was amazing, we really love this ship, and much more. Hopefully you'll see one of these related reviews :D have a good day<//Review>

<review>Straight hair, straight A's, straightforward
Straight path
I don't cut corners
I make a point to be on time
Head of the student council
I don't black out at parties
I jam to Paul McCartney
If you ask me how I'm doing
I'll say...
Well, hmm
I was adopted when I was two
My parents spoiled me rotten
Often I ask myself, "What did I do?"
To get as far as I've gotten
A pretty girl walks by my locker
My heart gives a flutter
But I don't dare utter a word
'Cause that would be absurd behaviour
For little miss perfect
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
No, I can't risk falling off my throne
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love is something I don't even know
Straight hair, straight A's, straightforward
Straight girl
Little miss perfect
That's me
One night my friend stayed over
We laughed, and drank and ordered
Something about her drew me in
What? It's totally platonic
That night was so exciting
Her smirks were so enticing
Hours speed by like seconds
Then, what happens is iconic
She takes a sip, I bite my lip
She tells a joke, I nearly choke
She braids my hair, I sit there
Blacking out for the first time
Next thing I know, I lose control
I finally kiss her but oh no
I see a face in my window
Then my brain starts to go
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
No, you can't risk falling off your throne
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love is something you don't even know
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You can't risk falling off your throne
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love
You don't even know
Rewind, induce amnesia
Deny the truth, that's easier
You're just confused, believe her
When she says there's nothing there
It's never worth it
When you're little miss perfect</review>< pics>

Straight hair, straight A's, straightforward
Straight path
I don't cut corners
I make a point to be on time
Head of the student council

I don't black out at parties
I jam to Paul McCartney
If you ask me how I'm doing
I'll say...
Well, hmm

I was adopted when I was two
My parents spoiled me rotten
Often I ask myself, "What did I do?"
To get as far as I've gotten
A pretty girl walks by my locker
My heart gives a flutter
But I don't dare utter a word
'Cause that would be absurd behaviour
For little miss perfect

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
No, I can't risk falling off my throne
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love is something I don't even know
Straight hair, straight A's, straightforward
Straight girl
Little miss perfect
That's me

One night my friend stayed over
We laughed, and drank and ordered
Something about her drew me in
What? It's totally platonic

That night was so exciting
Her smirks were so enticing
Hours speed by like seconds
Then, what happens is iconic

She takes a sip, I bite my lip
She tells a joke, I nearly choke
She braids my hair, I sit there
Blacking out for the first time
Next thing I know, I lose control
I finally kiss her but oh no
I see a face in my window
Then my brain starts to go

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
No, you can't risk falling off your throne
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love is something you don't even know
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You can't risk falling off your throne
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Love
You don't even know

Rewind, induce amnesia
Deny the truth, that's easier
You're just confused, believe her
When she says there's nothing there
It's never worth it
When you're little miss perfect</Text>

<Review>i love the representation! #lgbt🏳️‍🌈 #pride #wap definitely would recommend. very sad disney is discontinuing, although it’s not the creators fault. i feel like i can relate to Luz a lot as well because i also might be bi, and i am also a big stan of Amity.

as always, be a #girlboss- i’m out🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈

<Name>Anonymous User</Name><Time>1521961338657</Time><Rate>1</Rate><review>New or potential clients beware!

It’s understandable that significant annual savings on health benefits motivate clients to migrate to Lumity however, after your initial year or two if you’re lucky, there will no longer be savings thus little to no incentive to stay. The trade-off for the dollars saved is potential compliance issues, on-going problems and lack of transparency related to your sensitive employee data, mediocre on-going client support, and little to no savings after your first year.

If you do not know yet, manual data manipulation is what powers Lumity. The Sales team will do a great job of selling you on future system functionality, but the reality is the product has not considerably changed in the last couple of years. You may be sold on EDI but it does not exist as management prefers to manually munge data. Unfortunately, system integrations and meaningful software releases move at a snail's pace as the engineering and product teams are bogged down with support/bug tickets and feature request to alleviate the administrative burden of the back office team.

When it comes to day-to-day support, the client services team is reactive instead of proactive and root cause analysis is used to identify a scapegoat rather than preventing issues long-term. The client service team will do a great job of making things “hands-off” for their customers but this is mostly driven by the shortcomings of the product (i.e. Today, client administrators are not able to pull any reports including a simple employee census report from the admin portal). Unfortunately, there are some good account managers but they are not able to focus on more meaningful work for their customers as they are overwhelmed with escalations.

If you decide to on-board to Lumity be sure that your contract outlines the expectations which were discussed during the sales cycle.< /review>< Pics>

From the time of first contact with Sandy, I was provided immediate and thorough communication about their services, expected rent, and electronic reporting/payment system.  Very pleased to have a PM as capable as Maya who provided help to prepare the properties for listing and found qualified tenants in 1-month's time in one case and a mere 4 days in another.  She has always been there to help residents, even in the case where an emergency replacement of water heater became necessary during the holidays (during shelter-in-place).  I appreciate the professionalism and peace of mind they offer to owners.

<Review>Been with this company since 2014! Anytime an issue arises with our rental properties, problem was ALWAYS taken care of in a timely manner. We moved out of the area, along with raising our young children, working two jobs. Sac Delta Property Management was a time & money saver!< /Review>< pictures>

Team could be more responsive and proactive. The homes need some sprucing up and I drove past and could easily see that - tree trimming ..etc. Not sure if someone drives past the homes periodically.
Please see if this can happen.<//Review>

As tenants of a privately owned rental property, we've been very impressed and pleased with the management of Sacramento Delta Property Management. We are entering our third year of our lease, so we have had sufficient time to experience several typical service or support needs (AC service, garage door repair, plumbing or electrical need, and general questions.)  Sacramento Delta is alway very prompt and professional. Issues are resolved right away through quality service technicians. Couldn't be happier. I would not hesitate to recommend a rental property managed by Sacramento Delta, and would recommend them to any property owner looking for a quality management company to manage their rental property.< /text>

Terrible experience renting with them. And terrible experience trying to rent with them again a few years later. I guess I finally learned my lesson. If you are fine with a rental property not only taking your full, really high, security deposit but also charging you extra for “repairs” then this is the place for you. Good luck!<//review>

I've done business with Sacramento Delta Property Management for many years as a vendor for carpet cleaning. They've always been very professional about having properties ready and accessible for me to perform my work. I'm able to reach someone if I have a question or a problem and they're good about paying on time for my services. I hope to continue doing business with them in the future and would highly recommend them to other vendors.      Ron Haworth< /review>

<Review>For half a decade I rented from them.  I got an entire house for significantly better value than what a limited apartment would have cost.  I'm not sure if their houses are listed on Zillow, so you should call directly to Sacramento Delta and speak to their agents.  All their properties are well kept in nice areas.  It is way worth it to just call them, they found me a better place than I could find on my own!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I had a great experience with Sacramento Delta Property Management.  How often can you say that ?!?!?!  Kesha was responsive as I pursued the property during a high demand window in the calendar.  She and her assistant Nathan were attentive and welcoming during the paperwork & move in process.  I can't say I've had a better experience.   Kudos to you !!!< /Review>

I had a back up in my house a couple of weekends ago. I notified Sac Delta of the problem on sunday afternoon. they were kind and were on top of it. they had a plumber contact me the very next day and were there all the way through to completion. I have rented from them for years and they have always been wonderful!<//review>

The folks at Sac Delta are remarkable....from the rental interview through move-in...just first rate!  My apartment was professionally cleaned before I moved in, and it showed!  Also, their responsiveness to any of my inquiries were immediate...not once did I wonder if I got lost on someone's "todo" list.  AND their follow-up was top notch as well.  These guys are amazing to work with.< /text>

Sac Delta has been a full service management provider for my unit in Roseville. They have always responded quickly to any owner related questions and  concerns. The agent communicates the renters needs and works with owner to find a quick efficient solution saving owner time and keeping renter satisfied.< /review>

Sac Delta did a great job of managing my rental property. Once I turned it over to them, I didn't have to worry about  maintenance, screening tenants and collecting rents. When it came time to sell, they worked with my agent to make sure the house was clean and ready.<//Text>

Book keeping is more than adequate, especially at tax time. Notifications for tenant complaints is good, but could use a little better follow up on when issues are resolved.  Would like to see more active management of property, including drive by's to at least check the condition of landscaping.. If the front looks bad, chances are the back looks worse and also may be indicative of the interior condition. I would not hesitate to recommend Sacramento Delta Property Management, Inc. to my friends.  James<//review>

I've used SacDelta for about 20 years and have had a number of property managers. They have all been professional and responsive, and I think that the management fees are fair.  I've had several long-term tenants and no problems because of the thorough qualifying process used by SacDelta.</review>

I have lived in my location for almost 33 years and Sacramento Delta has been the property manager for more than half of those years.  I have found them to be very easy to work with.  They respond immediately to any service call or repair that is needed and have worked with me during difficult times.< /Review>

Carol Quinn handled our rental.  This is by far the best experience I have ever had renting a house.

I have rented off and on for quite a few years and have never had a property manager be so quick to get back to me; so quick to respond to questions; and be so accommodating to our schedule. It took less than one week from the time we noticed the listing to us getting the keys and being able to move in. That even includes replacing carpet in three areas of the house!

I can't recommend her highly enough, and feel very fortunate that she was the manager assigned to the property we wanted to rent. I would definitely work with her any time I had the need to rent a house, either as the owner or the renter.</text>

So I have good credit, I have good rental history. I’ve been renting a property for nine years only problem it was my dad‘s. I always paid my rent it was a lease agreement etc. etc. I went in and met all the criteria they would not even let me fill out an application because of this being my fathers house. This does not seem fair to be honest and they lost a potential great client.  I have a great job and make plenty of money to where my wife can even stay home. We have four kids. I told them it was an emergency, I could’ve even paid a double or triple deposit. They had no idea I actually just pulled out of an escrow on a home. I just have to rent for short term. It does not sound like this is within renting laws. I’m gonna have to check into it. Regardless it seems like discrimination to tell someone they can’t even fill out an application for a rental and I make 120k a year lol< /text>

<text>I have found the property managers I have worked with over the past many years to be not very responsive to my property related questions and concerns. The only person who has provided good service in the past has been Barbara Barrows, the Auburn Boulevard office manager. I have turned to Barbara for assistance when  I wasn't able to get the needed corrective action by the regular property manager assigned to manage my Sacramento property. Even though I have had a variety of property managers over the years, none has proven to be very responsive.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

We've been working with Sac Delta as our property management group for the past five years, with four properties in the Sacramento region. We have been very satisfied with their service. They are very knowledgeable about the market and about the region. Last month, one of our properties rented after only one day on the market. I thought that was unusual, maybe just luck, but just this week another of our properties rented after only two days on the market. Our manager, Lyn, is diligent and attentive in her review of applications. She's efficient and effective in working with us and tenants to solve problems. Their entire staff and team of support contractors (for repairs, installations, etc) are professional. As an owner, Sac Delta is able to keep costs down while ensuring the quality of service is high.</text>

<Review>Called twice (one week And then the next week), left a voicemail for Vince. Never returned my call. Called back the next week, and told the receptionist he didn't call me, so she took a message. Guess what? Never got a call back either. All I wanted was to set up a viewing. Guess they have better things to do. Definitely not applying for a house from a company who doesn't even want my business.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x809ad93ff3e55717:0x5e54ed0ca28c5519</gmapID></record>

Lori Day At Sac Delta property management took care of my property in West Roseville for over 10 years.  I've had other companies for my properties but Lori is the best manager I have ever had.  Organized, professional and always gets back to me in a timely manner. The fees are lower than my fees in Arizona & they have the best contacts for repairs.  I've only had two renters in all that time because Lori knows how to find the quality renters that always pay on time and take good care of my home.< /Review>

If you are an advarage American that has had some mistakes here and there, don't waste your time and money here, you will not get approved no matter how much income you can show them.

<Text>Sacramento Delta Property Management guarantees satisfaction in their rental properties. We moved in March 2016 and had an issue with our microwave losing power. A technician from Sid's Appliance came out and inspected the microwave and got it to work again. Within a matter of a few weeks, the microwave had lost power again. The Sid's Appliance technician came to our home and replaced the old microwave with a brand new. Sacramento Delta Properties immediate response to our service call makes us very happy to know that they care about our families needs. We highly recommend Sacramento Delta Property Management to our family and friends!</Text>< Pics>

Before we applied I asked what do they look for in our credit they said good credit in the pass 2 years so we applied. We where denied for things that happened 7 years ago. Didn't matter that we have excellent references and rental history and that My husband makes more money that what they where asking for. Waste of time and money. Plus after they denied us their customer service went from good to the worse I had experience.< /review>

The lady that was helping me originally, Linda, was very kind and helpful. But not only did I not get approved for the applications I submitted for my roommates and I, but they accidentally double charged me $150 dollars for the applications when it should have been $90. I contacted them and even sent them a screenshot of my bank account but they say on "their end" it says they only charged me $90. I was told that my screenshot and information was sent to corporate to be "investigated" and no one has contacted me back with a follow up although I've left messages and have been trying to get in contact with anyone that can help me get my money back.<//Text>

I have been a property owner/manager for 40 years, so I know the business well. Since I moved from Sacramento a few years ago and turned my properties over to Sac. Delta Property Mgt., I have been very pleased. Anyone who knows anything about property management is aware that one cannot successfully interview prospective tenants and manage property remotely. Sac. Delta Property Mgt. has done a good job of finding quality tenants for me and managing my properties, and for that, I am pleased.

I kept in close contact with Diane Goebel in the Auburn office and she was friendly up until I sent my application, SSN info and driver's license picture. They're requesting heavy guidelines for a property in a bad neighborhood and it's unfortunate that they would prefer to rent to people who may not be a good tenant. I hope they learn their lesson.< /review>

Sarah is very snotty and would not work with our schedule. Took several days to get a response and several calls - over 6 days. In addition, I felt a little pushed to the side when I tried to ask for a later timeframe...no movement for a potential renter. When I asked about the refrigerator for the home - the response was 'if you can't afford a refrigerator you can't afford the house.' I have a few thousand ready to put down to rent and this is the response I get from this company. Not the best service I have seen in a people oriented business. Plus, researching the site was difficult. We were redirected to various sites - HotSpot rentals and some bizarre site that was a dead end. This leads me to believe that this is a scam one would find on Fox 40 or Call Kurtis about losing: financial, housing, and personal identity. I don't trust this group at all.< /review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I rented from Sacramento Delta Property management for 2 years.  Our initial property manager Patrick was amazing. A year into our lease he was replaced with another property manager Desiree and Janeth.  It was all down hill from here.  I could barley get these two to contact me when I had questions about the property and move out and when they would contact me they were both snotty and rude.

Upon move out my boyfriend and I made the condition of the house 10 times better than when we moved in and we are now dealing with them telling us we owe them money on top of the 1450$ deposit we already paid.  There were 3 things needed to be fixed and after getting estimates our self the damages should have equaled out at max to $600.

If you don't care about how you are treated and can just shovel out money and never expect to see it again, this is the perfect property management company for you.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>We had a nice family dinner here. My parents and my brother enjoy the taste of their food. The carbonara was made in an authentic Italian manner. Food and drinks were coming out fast. The place was so spacious, and it has a lovely setting. The staffs were so helpful and kind to us. We had a nice time in this restaurant.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7b4c1a0a739:0x47e5ead9ffcdbc83</Gmap_id>< Date>

I asked for an extra pizza box with my pizza because I was working with a group of workers, and with concern of COVID-19, I wanted to eat separately with them to reduce the possibilities of getting infected. However, the cashier refused to give me an extra box and we had a slight quibble because of it. Eventually, I decided to make a refund because I was totally unsatisfied and humiliated by the attitude of the cashier. I asked for a receipt, and she gave me one that says *BAD ORDER* and just an order number on the receipt. This is the first time I saw a receipt like this, so I questioned her if this was the right receipt that she was supposed to give me. She started shouting and as soon as I tried to leave evidence and take footage of her behavior, she started to do the same thing in a threatening pose. This was the worst kind of service I had in years in a restaurant and I highly recommend other customers to be aware of this type of situation happening again in the future.

Do not! I MEAN DO NOT! order at Domino's Pizza I went there earlier this month and saw something disgusting in the kitchen at Dominos. Don't ask how I got into the kitchen of this HORRIBLE place, but i did. What I saw disgusted me so much I threw up on the floor.
I saw... I saw....I saw......HUMAN FECES! Right on my 14 inch extra pepperoni and extremely cheesy pizza with olives for 19 dollars and 99 cents. I mean how outrageous is that 20 bucks for a pizza might as well give them my grandmothers ashes from 1997 (I tell you my grandmother's ashes are in mint condition and she is a rare classic from the 90's). But then I remembered that POO is

I love this place completely. My husband and I eat lunch here every day or every other day. The employees were fantastic, and we had a nice chat with them. As usual, the service is swift and the food served is the finest.<//Text>

I went to this dominos tonight. Repeated my name multiple instances. The employee gave me a box that seemed incorrect so I opened it and it changed into. I instructed her and she or he said “N-I-G-E-L?” and i said “no M-E-G-A-N” and that they asked if i used to be sure? (yes- that’s my call??) and positioned the pizza that my (doubtlessly) dirty arms have been throughout back within the hotter. In a virus.<//text>

For a long time this place was really hit or miss, sometimes the service was ok and other times it was downright terrible. However over the past couple of months this place has really upped their game and the service is consistently pretty good. The food is never a problem its pretty consistent as what you would expect from Domino's, which is all you can ask for quality wise. Hopefully they will continue with the improved service there and that would make them a 5 star location.< /Review>

<text>Really nice to find a pizza place that is open LATE and delivers! Also that they have a variety of sizes and options! The pizza and cheese sticks I ordered were good and they even called me before delivering to make sure everything on my order was correct.  Food arrived early and tasted great! I definitely recommend this spot and will be ordering from here again!< /text></record>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>The pizza here is some of the best I've had in the San Fernando Valley. The ingredients are excellent. My usual go to is the Truffle pizza - simple, yet delicious. I liked the way the ordering process was before, where you would order as you go down the line where all the ingredients are. Because this is simply not the process anymore, that's why I deducted a star. The service also used to be slightly better, and not sure exactly why but my pizzas the last couple times have been burnt. I'm not sure if it was just left too long in the oven or what the issue was, but the flavors were there. Despite these small issues, I highly recommend this place !<//text>< Pictures>

I've been coming here for 3 years and it still stands as my favorite pizza place! The staff is always so friendly and professional. You can occasionally bump into the owner Jesse, he'll check up on tables and is always so pleasant to talk to! A really down to earth and humble guy! Amazing atmosphere relaxing when it's not too busy but fun and chill when it is busy. The pizza is so delicious and you can taste the quality in the ingredients and produce used. The dough is seriously out of this world  one of my favorite places to go to for any occasion period.<//review>

The one thing I really like is the ask to see the card that you charged with if you buy the pizza online. With all the crime that's going on downtown it's nice to see that a company cares about its customers. I can never leave after picking up my pizza before sitting down on one of the tables having a couple slices then I walk to my home which is very close.

Cashiers are very rude and wouldnt explain to the customer in a calm and professional manner of what was wrong. They started shouting once they felt annoyed, and the overall service was terrible. I would not expect a good conversation with these people if you are planning to order or dine in this location.<//Review>

Me and my coworker wanted to get some pizza for lunch, the service was quick and fast. Our pizza was super hot and fresh.

Thank you Domino's Pizza for the amazing pizza and how quickly and fast.

This place is good. We were staying at the Marriott Newport Coast Villas and had them deliver. Really good pizza. If you like Los Angeles style pizza you'll like this. We also got the garlic knots and they were just ok. But the pizza was very good. Customer service was outstanding! I would definitely recommend this place.</text>

The pizzas here are made perfectly. I usually don't like Domino's but I tried this location and the pizza is just better than usual. The crust is perfectly cooked and the ingredients are actually great. Definitely recommend.</text>

I love Domino's, I have the app so every time that I want pizza I order in there and at the moment that I arrive they already have it done for me, they are so fast!! The flavor is nice and they have a lot of specials in the app :) most of the times the large pizza is around 9-14 dollars :) :)< /Review>

This was the worst experience I had with Dominoes. I will not be ordering from this location again. They need to get it together. I love Dominoes and I know they do not ever treat their customers the way I was treated ordering from this location.</Review>

< Review>
I placed an order online an hour before these guys closed. I share an account with my parents, so they tried calling the wrong cellphone number. When I tried calling them back (5 times) they would not answer the phone and the line kept hanging up on me.
So I never got my pizza and no one ever got ahold of me to tell me why I didn’t get my pizza. After a long 12 hour day of working I was very disappointed. And I understand it was late at night, but I ordered an hour before the store closed, not 5 minutes before they closed. Very disappointed.< /Review>

<Text>Called this location to place an order. Order 2 pizzas and sent a family member to pick this up. When he returned he had 2 boxes of wings, one PEPPERONI and one SAUSAGE pizza. The group does not eat pork due to religious reasons. We called them to make them aware of the wrong order the associate, Jessica argued that this was the order because she took the order. Amazing that people who do not eat pork would accidentally order 2 pork pizzas. Jessica went on to say that she was the manager and hung up. After calling back the "manager" claims to the mistake on our end for ordering the wrong pizza. I cannot believe they argued food which we couldn't not eat and wanted to return. They offer no resolution until we arrived. Absolutely unacceptable!!< /Text>< Pictures>

Overall: Their brisket is delicious and their pizza and wings are worth trying.<//Text>< UserId.>

< Review>
I ordered pizza at 12:30 am
And the time the pizza delivery guy came to me
It is 1:50 pm.

I did not receive the order.
I asked why I was so late
The delivery guy told me.
We told them our delivery time was two hours.

I have not seen anywhere on the website that it takes two hours and I have not received any contact.

I was a frequent shopper
The distance was one block and they came to me in 1 hour and 20 minutes.

You will have to explain to me.
There was no explanation that it took 2 hours anywhere, and the delivery guy told me that our delivery time was 2 hours
I spoke without courtesy.< /Review>

<text>Absolutely terrible service. I called and ask what specials, if any, they have and the gal cut me off several time. I paused and ask to repeat the special she just mentioned, but got a very quick and short “2 topping-2pizzas $19.99”

I asked if there are any other specials, to which she relied “you can look at the website.”

I asked if there are any popular ones that she’s aware of, as I’m looking to buy 4-5 large pizzas, she relied “sighed” and hung up.</text><userid>113381193841781971612< /userid>< pics>

<Text>Do NOT order from this Dominos. They messed up our order and we got a free pizza for next time. The next time we ordered and used the free pizza coupon we were shocked to find out the delivery guy added himself a huge tip of over 60% onto our card AFTER we had tipped him in cash. THIS IS FRAUD and Dominos has forever lost our trust and business.< /Text>< GmapID>

I actually really like Domino's and this location is fine, though I might only think this because I was pretty drunk when I got food here. It also weirded me out how much my farts smelled exactly like the pizza I ate. Like, exactly.</Text>

AMAZING.  Seriously the pizza has so much flavor and crust has the perfect thickness. Different ingredients don't get muddled, which was surprising for a pizza.</Text>

I've asked what the status was, and got an angry employee shouting; "When it is ready we will shout your name.". 15 minutes later still no pizza. Asking again what the status was, it was in the heater for 15 minutes already, ready to be picked-up. When I asked for a reason, she said; "I don't know and walked off". Worse staff in any dominos on the entire world. Not polite and definitely not working on customer service.

Never returning here.<//Text>< pics>

I ordered online and then they cancelled the after 1 1/2 hour without calling even though the tracker said it was on the way. This was only 11 at night. This is the second time they did this. There wont be a third. Screw this location.<//Text>

Literally the worst Dominos location. First,  I ordered a pizza. Waited an hour. Nothing. Called.  The employee lied and said they couldn't get in the building -- despite having a 24/7 doorman. I spoke to a manager, then she said something about the bike delivery man was concerned about getting rain in the building -- called me ( they didn't) I didn't answer and my order was cancelled.

Fast forward to today, about a week later, after placing an order at 12:28pm, i just got a phone call at 2pm saying that they're just starting my order and that it'll be here in ANOTHER HOUR.

DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM THIS LOCATION.< /Review>

And when I called the store to ask about were my pizza was the girl told me there was one delivery ahead of mine. Which wouldn't make sense since I live less than a half a mile from the store. So 30 min would make sense, not an hour. I told the person on the phone this and she hung up on me. This is horrible customer service, and it will make me second guess ordering from here ever again.<//review>< Pics>

I order my pizza from this location all the time. Today I ate two slices then went in for another slice while eating my third slice I noticed something hanging I thought it was cheese I pulled on it and immediately noticed it was hair and the hair wasn’t Just on top it was COOKED INTO MY PIZZA! So I called to let them know the girl that answered the phone Jazzet I started to tell her what happen she asked me to bring the pizza back so they could have a look at it and I told her that I don’t have a car and that I wasn’t able to then she said well you ordered a hour ago it took you a hour to find a piece of hair and I started to tell her my kids ate first then I sat down to eat but couldn’t get that out because she hung up in my face I immediately called back I was very upset nobody answered so my boyfriend called from his phone and immediately asked to speak to a manager the guy that answered said he was the manager his name was Alejandro he was no better because he didn’t even offer an apology he just they he’ll give me another pizza or give me credit for a new one I told him I don’t want another pizza I don’t want anything from them because I don’t even trust it I asked for a refund and he said hegave me the refund but didnt even sound like he cared about the situation I’ll be waiting to see my refund hopefully or I’ll be calling back again .... this place has horrible customer service and the girl that hung up the phone should loose her job maybe she’ll think about how she treats customers then if she’s taught that lesson don’t order here at this location there horrible</review>

I don't know why they have such an issue cutting the thin crust pizza in squares.  I ordered online and specifically choose the special instructions to cut into squares.. when I arrived I told them again to cut into squares.. when I got the carry out.. sure enough it was NOT cut into sqaures.. not only was it not in squares they forgot the onions I paid extra for.  They screw up the cut into squares all the time.  And first time they forgot an item..< /Review>

<Review>Items frequently come with missing toppings. Just ordered an item and delivery driver refused to deliver pizza. Manager was unhelpful and rude as well. This was the last straw, not that it will probably matter, but I will never order from this store again. A number of these 5 star reviews can't be real, or they've had a very different experience than I have with this location.<//Review>< Date>

<date>1499149704187</date><rating>1< /rating><Text>Ordered two pizzas for delivery at 9:10 pm, the tracker said it was ready at 9:45. I called in about 10:20 because there were no more updates. The person working said the pizzas were the next to go, insisted the tracker was unreliable and both pizzas would still be hot. When I got the pizza, at 11pm, two hours after ordering, both were room temperature at best. One was also made incorrectly. The employees didn't mark the delivery as complete so I can't leave feedback there. Two delivery men were at the hotel lobby when I was called down to pick it up. Obviously poor optimization of workers. The delivery man I was not taking my pizza from was actually pleasant and he brought hot pizza directly to peoples rooms.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c7b4c1a0a739:0x47e5ead9ffcdbc83</GmapID></record>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Sadly, one of our attorney's is leaving, so we decided to order pizza for his party. I placed an order at 9:00 am for delivery at 11:45 to 444 South Flower (financial district of DTLA). I then called back twice after 10:00 am to add additional items. Not only was my order on time, the young man who delivered it (I wish I knew his name) brought our pizza to the 20th floor! Considering he came on a bike with 10 pizzas, 2 cookies, 4 boxes of chicken and 2 boxes of bread/stuffed bread, he was extremely polite, friendly and funny.

We will definitely be placing another order with this branch. Thanks Domino's for making our going away party a success.< /text>< pictures>

<text>This place is a joke. Ordered online at 1:00pm, it's 1:43pm I've been on hold for 15 minutes so I can check on my order! my online order tracker has been on "We're Firing It Up" since 1:02pm! How busy could you really be on a Friday at 1:30pm?

I'd just hit a local pizza place if I was you, wasted my lunch break on these guys. Awesome.

UPDATE: it's 2:19pm and the "Prefection Check" is being completed. Took about 30 minutes LMFAOO< /text>< UserId.>

I actually enjoyed watching their assembly line in action- they’re busy but very efficient. I’ve also pre-planned for parties with them and everything was super smooth. Best dominos I’ve seen yet! Also they do vegan and gluten free... wuuut.</text>< user_name>

<Review>I go here a lot.  The thin crust pizza is what I always order, and it's always made well.  However, starts deducted for service reasons. twice I've ordered a thin crust and they made it regular crust.  I have to double check it before I leave now.  Walked in on a Saturday night at 10:30, sign posted and hours online said they were open until 1am. I was told they were closed and they wouldn't serve me.  I was pissed at having wasted a drive AND not getting any pizza.  You need to update your takeout hours online if you're closing earlier than you say!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

worst dominos, always get order wrong, omit toppings, etc, then pizza is delivered upside down or as if it was tossed around like a fedex package, then mgr has audacity to attribute it to bumpy rides.  better to buy frozen digornios. lost a longtime customer with this repeated bullsh1t.<//Text>

They can get really bussy but its worth the wait 🍕 Delivery drivers have a awsome talent they give there best to get there dilivery to its destination on a bike 🚴, risking the downtown Traffic & Drivers.🌆🚘🚛🚙🚌👍</text>

-  Friendly and bilingual staff (English and Spanish)
- Convenient to grab a quick bite ( if you can walk there)
-inconvenient if you're trying to drive there because there is no street parking available, most if the time.</text>

The worst customer service ever experienced from a dominos. The lady was incredibly rude to us. Also would not deliver to us and would not give us any explanation as to why. Will never go here in the future!</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very good place to eat. The problem is that it takes around 15 minutes for each order, so it is not a good option for a quick purchase.
But the people who attend are very good and have a letter in Spanish, which helps a lot.
In addition, the wide opening hours are good, which is very good for when you have to eat late

(Original)
Muy buen lugar para comer. El problema es que tardan alrededor de 15 minutos en cada pedido, por lo que no es una buena opción para una compra rápida.
Pero la gente que atiende es muy buena y tiene una carta en español, lo cual ayuda y mucho.
Además es bueno el horario de atención tan amplio, con lo cual es muy bueno para cuando tienes que cenar tarde< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) I've never had such bad pizza. I ordered a buffalo mozzarella with chicken and had only pepper. So much pepper that when I bit the first piece, I could not swallow. I kept my mouth burning for a long time and had to leave the hotel in search of something to snack on. One could never imagine that a pizza with buffalo mozzarella, supposedly healthier, could have so much pepper. Warning: When ordering pizza at this location in Los Angeles, order NO SPICY, NO PEPPER and everything else that is possible, otherwise you will eat a pepper pizza.

(Original)
Eu nunca comi uma pizza tão ruim. Pedi uma de mussarela de búfala com frango e só tinha pimenta. Tanta pimenta que ao morder o primeiro pedaço, não consegui engolir. Fiquei com a boca ardendo por bastante tempo e tive que sair do hotel em busca de algo para lanchar. Nunca poderia imaginar que uma pizza com mussarela de búfala, supostamente mais saudável, poderia ter tanta pimenta. Aviso: ao pedir pizza neste local em Los Angeles, peçam NO SPICY, NO PEPPER e tudo mais que for possível, caso contrário comerá uma pizza de pimenta.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Highly recommended, they serve you very kindly and the prices are normal. The pizzas make them relatively fast according to the people there are and you can see how they make them. The only downside is that there is very little space to eat there, barely 3 tables and a small bar

(Translated by Google) A small place but with good attention and fast, very rich and with a variety of flavors, textures and sizes, which complements fried chicken, soft drinks, hamburgers and sandwiches. In a commercial, recreational area where you can complement your purchase and carry out other activities, you have a parking space which facilitates your purchase, there is also at home.

(Original)
Un lugar pequeño pero con buena atención y rápido, muy rica y con gran variedad de sabores, contexturas y tamaños, que complementa con pollo frito, gaseosas, hamburguesas y sándwiches.
