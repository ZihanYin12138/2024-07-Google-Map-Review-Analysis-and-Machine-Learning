I had high hopes for this restaurant since it is so close to our house.   Today was the third time for me to try A Taste Above and the third time I was disappointed.  The first time I tried the bulgogi fries and they had hardly any meat and didn’t taste fresh.  I was left feeling unsatisfied and hungry after eating.  The second time I ordered banh mi and again it had hardly any meat and bun was not fresh.  I also waited for 30 minutes. Today I went in to order and after ordering the cashier told me it was going to be 45 minutes before the food was ready.  I ended up asking for my money back.  I think the banner hanging on the side of building where an actual sign belongs is a good indication of the mismanaged operation.  The restaurant is always cluttered and a mess on the inside.  It seems as if the owners put saving money before providing good food and customer service.  With no one else in the restaurant I’m not sure how it would take 45 minutes to cook 1 hamburger.  I would recommend skipping this place.</Review>

I explained to my employee that 40 minutes was an excessive time to quote, 30 at most.  By all means we try to process orders 15 minutes or less, but we are not going to sacrifice quality just to save a few minutes.  We may not seem busy with nobody in the restaurant, but since we aren’t offering dine-in service at this time, we get multiple phone orders and catering jobs that we are trying to complete as fast as we can.  As far as the unorganized look you see, I wish we had room to store the cardboard boxes I’m sure you were referring to. Those are to pack meals for the Senior citizen program we are involved with the City.  Other than that, we just had our Health Inspection last week and passed with flying colors, something we preach about.   We ask that you come in and give us a try again and seek me out if you have any comments or concerns.  Regards, Rich'}</resp>

<text>!!!!!!VEGAN FRIENDLY!!!!!
Oh my goodness they have the BEST vegan Philly cheesesteak I’ve ever had. I live in Roseville and I would legit drive all the way out here just to have that sandwich again. The vegan spicy Mayo has the perfect kick to it, they pack the sandwich with “meat”, bell peppers, and cheese. Highly recommend this place!</text>< Pictures>

They do a great job in making things the way you want.  I like my Japanese food the way my parents made it...not sweet and without a ton of sauce that Americans like. If you want it spicy they can make it, just ask.<//review>

I have gone there three times because I so badly wanted to enjoy their food.  Small portions.  SUPER cheap ingredients.  Not even hot and a LONGGGGG wait.    Really overpriced when the same menu items are found at TWO next door restaurants at much higher quality and lower prices.  Meh at best.</review>

I’d like to start by saying we use offer portions and prices that we feel is competitive with other like businesses. As for your accusation that we use super cheap ingredients, USDA choice beef is not cheap. As a matter of fact, with the rising food costs, we have not sacrificed quality or quantity, and nor did we increase our prices.  If you felt 15+ minutes was long, I apologize for that, but that’s pretty much the norm of all restaurants, especially those not open for indoor dining yet.  We hope you visit us again and give us another try.  Have a great weekend!'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x809acf0ad8ebc56d:0x99d5dab913cb11a0</Gmap_id></record>

Meh.  Not bad but nothing special.  Lunch specials a bit greasy and clearly from a steam table.  Lots of better options in and near the Pocket for quick Chinese food.</Text>

I have been meaning to go where's my wife for a while. My wife and I are in the area and finally decided to stop by. It is a nice and clean place with a very friendly staff. We also know the owner and had promised him that we will stop by and finally we did. I ordered Korean short ribs and asked him to make them hot which he did they were absolutely great. My wife also enjoyed her dish. They give you a lot of food and we both ended up taking some home. The buggers are really good and the next time when we go there with our friends I definitely I'm going to try them.<//Text>

First timers today. We tried their Pork Bahn Mi sandwiches, they were delicious. One of the best we’ve had. We had the house fried rice was yummy too. Yes it took a little bit to get the food but for fresh and tasty food it’s worth it. We will be back.<//text>

<Text>Why are you going to charge 13.75 for a vegan burger and then ask to swap out the the bun and cheese for the cheaper ones. It confuses the customers and obviously the servers too because after a long enough wait i still ended up with real cheese. Im calling it a "rip off" cause you should at least offer a discount. Bottom line if someone asks for a vegan burger, just give them a vegan burger period, easiest thing.< /Text>< Date>

<Text>I've been there twice now & ordered food once. Food is good, wonton soup had too much sesame oil which was basically all the flavor there was for the soup. Boba drinks are good but the second time I went they ran out of boba & one of my drinks was supposed to have egg pudding & boba which I subbed the boba for grass jelly & then they didn't include the egg pudding at all which it was supposed to come with. Lastly, found out I'm allergic to something in their boba mixes so I won't be returning, at least not if it's for myself.< /Text>< rate>

Freedom Ride is such a fun studio! It's really easy to sign up & manage classes online. The facility is clean and the staff is really nice and helpful. The rides are a sweaty workout that motivates you the whole time. Bonus, your first class free! I highly recommended checking this studio out!< /Text>

I am the worst about giving review on places, things I order online, etc., but this spin gym is well worth the effort. I have done spin at a number of spin studios throughout Newport  Beach and Costa Mesa over the past 3 years, and have committed to Freedom Ride in Newport Beach for the past 6 months. I have watched my stamina and strength increase, all the while watching my body change. I go a minimum of 3 times a week, usually 4-5 times, on top of other work outs I have incorporated in addition to spin. I am down 20 pounds, just in time for my wedding, and I have the wonderful people at Freedom Ride to thank! It is exactly the friendly fun and motivation I needed to get back into an active life style. I now can't imagine my life without it! Chris, the owner, has always been very accommodating with any questions or concerns I might have, and my two favorite trainers are Taryn and Erica. Both are extremely welcoming, have AWESOME music.They really know how to "get down"! If you're in for making new friends, learning some new dance moves, and are willing to "work your face off", literally, girls walk out without eyebrows after, this is for you!! Thanks Freedom for helping me get my health back! Love ya!</Review>

Freedom is very clean, friendly, welcoming and aesthetically pleasing studio. The interior design is open and chic, and you can tell a lot of hard work was put it to make this studio look nice. The owner, Chris, is very friendly and accommodating. The instructors are wonderful- whether you're a newbie or seasoned spinner, they'll encourage you and push you towards your best.

I love that this place has showers!! It saves so much time being able to shower off right there instead of going back home. The sound quality, lights and black lights make the actual workout really fun, more like clubbing than working out.

This is not your typical spin class where you just turn the resistance up and down and go fast and slow. This is a full body workout- you'll be doing crunches, sit-ups, tap backs and all sorts of movements on the bike for a full body workout. You'll do weights to work your arms and you are constantly moving.

Check out Matt's class. He is a ball of energy and I guarantee he'll be dancing at more than one given point during the workout. You'll have so much fun you'll forget that your legs are on fire and your calories are screaming as they burn.

This studio is worth checking out, you won't regret it.< /text>

I've since taken almost all of the instructors in the evening and have to say that Kelsey, Cece, and Maxie all bring it! I never leave class feeling like I've had less than an intense workout. I enjoy each of their classes and drive all the way from LA county for their great workout, awesome music, and overall fun environment!!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

LOVE freedom ride!! This studio is so welcoming with wonderful staff and great instructors that makes working out so much fun! The bikes are great and the studio is very clean.  They offer rental shoes & if you have never taken a cycle class the girls at the front will make you feel so comfortable by setting up your bike and answering any questions. I highly recommend this studio!!<//Review>

How stupid is it when you go in expecting cycling, but it’s more like a Zumba on a bicycle. Might as well Put your money into a good personal trainer. The workouts are ineffective and entirely no instructor even knows what they are doing. IT’S BASICALLY A BIG SCAM!!! You are better off taking a free cycle class weekly at a 24 hour fitness.< /review><user_id>102284527292862648599<//user_id>< Response>

I had an amazing experience at Freedm ride. The studio is VERY clean and welcoming atmosphere. The lady helped me get on and adjust my bike. The instructor was full of energy and motivating. I loved the vibe, music, and people. Upon entering there was a great sense of community with the other riders, instructor and girls working the front desk!</Review>

<resp>None< /resp><date>1500654721606</date><Text>I have been spinning for over 10 years mostly at the traditional places that offer classes like L.A. Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness.   Freedom Rider studio however offers a much more edgy, intense and motivating experience, it's completely incomparable to those other club spinning classes.   From the music, to the lighting, to the intensity of each drill, they give a complete workout, including arms and core drills. Everyone leaves the class dripping.  It takes a few times to catch on to how to do the spinning with the movements, but if you stick with it for a few classes you will "get it"!     The studio is very clean and has large cubical areas for belongings.  The staff is very friendly and helpful as well.   You will not regret giving this place a try.</Text>< Rating>

Freedom Ride is absolutely a beautiful and chic studio. Chris did a great job with the design and details. He goes above and beyond to make sure you're pleased, and warmly welcomes you. My experience with all the staff and different instructors have been positive, and I thank you!

The one detail I love is, they have showers! It makes it so much easier if you have a busy schedule. Being able to shower has saved me from going all the way home.

The vibe throughout the spin room is loud and full of energy. The music has me on a different level. By far this is the best workout I have ever experienced. I've been taking Matthew's classes for about 7-8 months, and he's so genuine and is a phenomenal instructor. He will push you to the edge, and have you drenched in sweat, yet feeling awesome! Coming from a girl who hates cardio, this is the only workout that I have ever enjoyed. So, if you're looking to burn some serious calories and have a fun workout, then come check out Freedom!< /Text>

Far cheaper and better than Soul Cycle (and other spin studios), Freedom Ride is a superb workout without hurting your wallet. The instructors are super friendly and are great at motivating you to achieve your best workout. Definitely give Freedom Ride a try if you need to switch up your workout routine.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcde6040cd995f:0x19074240d5e99bba< /Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
I am new to the spin world and after doing some spin studio shopping, I have fallen in love with the people and energy at Freedom Ride. Honestly, one of the reasons I signed up was because the owner Chris, took the time to chat and answer my questions, that caring effort goes a long way. Everyone is always super helpful, kind and happy. The instructors are UHmaxing, I highly recommend Cece and Maxie!! They really know how to work the room and get you fired up. The studio is spacious and clean, I wish they had showers though. Personal tip; bring two hair ties...your hair most likely will not stay in place.

< Review>
Freedom Ride is absolutely a beautiful and chic studio. Chris did a great job with the design and details. He goes above and beyond to make sure you're pleased, and warmly welcomes you. My experience with all the staff and different instructors have been positive, and I thank you!

The one detail I love is, they have showers! It makes it so much easier if you have a busy schedule. Being able to shower has saved me from going all the way home.

The vibe throughout the spin room is loud and full of energy. The music has me on a different level. By far this is the best workout I have ever experienced. I've been taking Matthew's classes for about 7-8 months, and he's so genuine and is a phenomenal instructor. He will push you to the edge, and have you drenched in sweat, yet feeling awesome! Coming from a girl who hates cardio, this is the only workout that I have ever enjoyed. So, if you're looking to burn some serious calories and have a fun workout, then come check out Freedom!< /Review>

My sister actually signed me up for a spin class at Freedom and I’m glad she did because I loved it. I haven’t tried spin before and got hooked! It’s fun, upbeat, and is something I look forward to. All of the instructors are great, my favorite being Maxie :)<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I have been going to spin for years, and I am very particular when it comes to my instructors with all my workouts in general. I have been going to Freedom Ride since last year, however I always took Matt's class because he is fun, motivating and has great music. I didn't want to try another instructor and possibly be disappointed after class if I didn't enjoy myself and feel like I didn't get a great workout because the music wasn't good. To me, spin is all about the music! Well, I tried other instructors at Freedom Ride so I could write a review, and hopefully find another good spin instructor I could take. I took Maxie, Erica, Taryn and Kisha. They were all really great instructors and I especially loved their music. I only wish I would have known sooner that Freedom Ride had so many great instructors.

The location is easy to get to, very clean, plenty of space between the bikes, everyone is very nice there and I love saying hello to Domino when I go there.< /Text>< Name>

I've really enjoyed my time at Freedom Ride.  I love the trainers, the high energy workouts and the overall encouragement that we receive when we workout.  I would recommend this workout for any fitness level.  I love the cleanliness and the amenities.< /review>

It’s rare that I look forward to waking up early to exercise, but Freedom Ride has achieved that for me. I have been coming here for about 4 months now and I am obsessed. The 7 am classes give me plenty of time to make it to work down the street by 9 am. They have two very clean showers and I rarely have to wait to use them. The classes themselves are fun and seriously pump you up, whether it’s a morning or evening class, and I’ve loved every instructor I’ve taken. The owner and front desk staff are very friendly and welcoming as well. Love this studio!<//Text>

This is such a great studio! All of the instructors I've been to are awesome, with their own style and music so you never feel like you're taking the same class twice. The classes are fun and an awesome cardio workout. I like that they incorporate arm weights as well. My only complaint is that they don't have more specials for existing riders so I can go more often! It does get pricey when you're not on the new rider special. I'd also love a 6 or 6:30 p.m. class option.</review>

<text>Freedom is absolutely terrific, let me break it down.

The facility first of all is clean, well equipped, and trendy putting you in a great mindset to optimize your ride from the get go. The front desk crew always smiles and remembers your name in a genuine way. The instructors have talent not just a cookie cutter class. This is rhythm riding at its finest because of the talent, they will make the class flow perfection. My biggest frustration in rhythm riding is transitions. A lot of instructors will have pauses between songs causing heart rate reductions and flow interruptions that hinder your gains. Freedom is well known for their legendary soundtracks and smooth transitions that reduce any gaps or performance loss.

The owner is incredible as some owners that are hands on can project negativity after issues but not here. They truely earn the business and do not just sell you. Do yourself a favor and hit their classes, just make sure to hydrate and caffienate ahead of time.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Kiana M is by far the best instructor at this studio, she changed my perception about indoor cycling and now it is in my weekly routine. The studio is clean and cute! So glad Freedom ride is on classpass (for only 6 credits, what a steal).< /text>

When you enter the studio you are immediately greeted and welcomed.  The studio is clean and simple, but also uplifting!  I love the motivational word wall.  They have two bathrooms and showers on site, which is helpful if you need to get to work right after class.  The owner Chris, is always welcoming and eager to make sure you have a great experience at the studio.  I’ve only taken Kisha’s classes, but I’ve heard great things about the other instructors.  Kisha is amazing! There is no way you are leaving her class without feeling motivated and accomplished!!! I like the way she organizes her sets and incorporates abs into her class. Brooke at the front desk is also super sweet and very helpful.  Overall, this is a studio you definitely want to check out!!!< /Review>< Pics>

FREEDOM RIDE IS THE BEST STUDIO IN ORANGE COUNTY. I love the welcoming atmosphere and dope staff. This includes my favorite instructor Maxie Haase AND best owner Chris Guaty. They not only offer spin classes, but boot camp now as well. I have also been a part of the flag football team on the beach. All around great studio. I HIGHLY recommend!!!!<//text>

I've tried quite a few spin studios throughout the Orange County area and I am officially sticking with Freedom from now on.  Their studio is conveniently located right by the freeway, they keep their studio extremely clean, and both instructors that I have tried were amazing.  And if you decide to stop by, be sure to say hi to the studio mascot, Domino. The most adorable pup who sits by the door greeting customers as they walk in... so sweet!

Maxie teaches classes at 5:30 on certain days and her playlist is super fun.  She's always switching up the music so I never get bored and each class is a totally different experience! She incorporates a climb and sprints into every class so there is a lot of variation to the pace of your workout.

Kisha was the second instructor that I decided to try out and she absolutely kicked my butt! She's extremely encouraging and pushes her class to go hard throughout the entire workout. Hands down one of the best workouts I have ever had!

If you're thinking of trying out spin for the first time, or if you work in the Irvine area, Freedom is an amazing place to workout!<//text>

My new favorite spin spot in the OC! The vibe of the studio is clean, cool and swanky. The instructor, Kisha, is ecstatic about health and well-being. I was greeted by an adorable receptionist at the front desk who helped me to my bike and adjusted it for me. I keep going back...I'm hooked!</text>

< Review>
I have been to every and I mean every cycle place from Irvine, Tustin, Newport, down to  Laguna where I live and this place is by far my FAVORITE.  The classes I attend which are the 5:30 pm M-F are always packed with fun people who really know how to jive well together.

The instructors are fantastic, each one different and unique in their own way.  This is such a positive for me, I hate repetitive workouts, ugh the same routines over and over, well not here!  I really feel like I get the best workout in the 45 minutes time, I spike my heart rate, burn massive calories and am challenged to be the max.

Facility: Clean and smells good

Bikes: Top of the line

Fridays...Beer and Champs offered after class... another positive

Location: Close to work for me, easy to get to and there is never a parking issue...plus

My only wish, not a complaint, is that they had more times offered on the weekends along with cold towels for after class.</Review>

I love this studio! For multiple reasons!

Studio: Bright, Airy, Spacious, super easy to get to right off the 73 frwy. They've got Showers! (Most spin studios don't have a shower.) The saddle room is also spacious, super clean - which is a must for me, and I love the stadium seating so everyone gets a good view of the instructor. The bikes pedal super smooth and quiet and I feel like I'm clipped in nice & secure. Nice surround sound & laser lighting!

Staff: The front desk girls are so so sweet, very welcoming. My all time fave spin instructor at any studio works at this one! >> Let's talk about Kisha!! Her playlists are on fire and her choreography is on point. I always have such a blast jamming to her beats, walk out of every one of her classes completely drenched in sweat, and with a fantastic endorphin high!  Also, I love that since she is also a CPT, she understands the mechanics of cardio intervals and doing certain choreography when in the fat burning phase, etc. I leave feeling like I got a full-body cardio workout!</review>

<name>Beau Kroondyk</name><Review>Quick list of why I am giving it 5 stars.
1) Great owner, Doug's his name.  He's constantly bettering the place with food and drink selections.
2) Good selection of beer, they even have Kilt Lifter
3) Pretty clean for a local dive bar
4) Good priced drinks

I've visited a handful of times and love it.  Since recently moving out here, I definitely will be back.<//Review></record>

<Text>A nice selection of beers that are always cold. They serve food now and have a tasty menu of items. Megan is always great and offers excellent service. Plenty of TVs to watch the Dodger games (they have Spectrum and DirecTV) and football games. Pool table, shuffle board, darts and AMI jukebox to play what you'd like.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>Had an ant problem and called out Jeff and he did a great job, quick and professional. He is very knowledgeable and when ever I have a new insect that I don’t know what it is, I take a pic and text him and he gets back to me right a way. Since his service I have not had any problems indoors and have noticed a decrease in ants and spiders outdoors as well.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>We first had Jeff of 1st Response out last year (Feb 2020) when we had an ant invasion. Jeff took care of the problem and it was a full year, almost to the day, before we saw ants return inside our home. Once again, Jeff & a team member came out to tackle the ant problem. They were both polite, professional, willing to explain what they were doing, and kind to our inquisitive dogs. That's another thing, they use pet friendly products if you ask them to. That was important to us. Both times we had them out, we've been super pleased with 1st Response's service & the results.</Review>< date>

He spent quality time explaining everything to us and diagnosing the problem. His company only uses pet and environmentally friendly product, but this did not detract from the effectiveness! We did not have to leave the house or anything and the   job got done right. No more ants! Highly recommend!</text>< Pics>

Jeff took care of our ant and rodent problems.  He explained his method well and came back several times and on demand when needed at no extra cost per our contract. He is friendly and respectful.  It was a little pricey for the rodent problem, but I didn't compare so I'm not sure if the price was normal. Overall I would call him again.</review>

Jeff was very informative. He was very friendly and easy to talk to. Very impressed on how professional he was and thorough he was. I would highly recommend 1st Response Pest Control.
I also love how we get a response right away! Ashlee has been friendly and responds to be right away. Very informative and puts my mind at ease. I highly recommend 1st Response for your pest control needs!!<//Review>

I received a text notifying me that the technicians were on their way. Jeff and his assistant were awesome (very friendly, knowledgeable and quickly took care of the problem before providing me with a briefing and advice for further preventative measures in the future). I highly recommend using this quick, efficient and affordable customer-friendly  service!</Review>< Pictures>

<username>Richard Rivoli< /username><text>So far everything has gone really well. It is really early in my dealings with 1st response, but everything has been taken care of professionally and I have had no problems when getting into contact with someone from the company. In this new age of computers and text messaging it makes it much easier to stay in contact with companies and employees who are available to help out. The one thing that I have appreciated is the continued professionalism of this company.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><gmapID>0x80c2595efb68f69d:0xe97526f1ec6841b4< /gmapID><rate>5</rate><resp>{'time': 1593781542593, 'text': 'Thank you Richard!

<text>I have been using this company since I bought my house about 4 years ago. They are so efficient and so good that I have recommended them to some of my friends I must honestly say with First Response I have peace of mind. The price is fair and the quality of the products is great. Since I started using them I can boast and say I haven't seen one insect in my house alive.<//text>< response>

Both Ashely, the who helped me over text to set up the appointment, and Jeff, the actual owner/technician who came in to deal with our problem were very, very professional and helpful.

Jeff not only provided an amazing service but also great follow up to his service by providing an instruction to deal with the situation through email.

He is also very friendly person who would answer any questions you have.

I am very glad we moved our service from Clark Pest Control to 1st Response Pest Control. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</review>

1st response has always been prompt, friendly, and professional. Most importantly I definitely saw a decrease in the bugs getting into my house after service started. Their approach is also said to be pet friendly, which is another plus in my book.

Update 9-21-2020 : 4 Months Later - we're moving out of town, so I want to leave a final review. I've used Jeff at 1st Response since August 2019 and he and his team have been awesome - extremely responsive (making extra house calls when a spot pest issue came up) and always extremely helpful and friendly. I say this as a real Palmdale resident - support your local businesses and use 1st Response vs. some "big brand" pest control company. Thanks 1st Response!</Text>

Moved into a home that was empty for a while and quickly realized we had unwanted guests. overwhelmed, we gave 1st response a call and Jeff came over ASAP and gave us a solution. we get bimonthly treatments and here we are a year later and still pest free. Jeff is very professional on time and really knows his profession. Answered any and all questions we had and is always available to talk to with any issues. you won’t be disappointed.< /Review>

1st Response Pest Control is honestly the best pest control service I have ever had! I tried Terminix and had the worst experience with them due to their screwed up billing. However, I am super fond of this company due to their attentiveness, their quality of products, but most importantly because of their service. I love how humble the owner is! Thank you!<//text>

We discovered a massive beehive on my bbq grill Tuesday. I called 1st Response and they came out the next day. When they got here, the problem had corrected itself but I still wanted it sprayed which they took care of.
Thank you for your quick response!! Its truly appreciated!!

<Text>I had Jeff come out and spray my home on Friday. As I am sure many of you know, and are experiencing, this summer the spiders are out of control - no matter how clean you are. Jeff was so incredibly professional, and just really easy to speak with. He answered my questions, and appears to have an extensive back ground in handling such challenging tasks. Especially when it was so hot. Long story short, amazing service, 100% quality work, I wish I could give more than 5 stars. No one else does this job better. Thank you Jeff, with 1st Response Pest Control. Also PLEASE- if your reading this, and he is doing services for you, offer him so water!

I’ve been using 1st Response Pest Control for two years now and they are great. Jeff is extremely knowledgeable, informative and professional. And unlike the past pest control companies I’ve used, I always get an email and a text stating the day, date and approximate time he will be by to spray my house instead of just showing up. I highly recommend Jeff and 1st Response Pest Control to anybody looking for a reliable, professional and friendly company.</Text>

Prompt and professional service. We were having problems with earwigs, roaches, and spiders. They are no longer a problem. I also like that they use pet friendly chemicals. Easy appointment booking online, very user friendly.</text>

Excellent service! I had an ant problem, pretty standard for the summer. They sent a guy named Jeff out to spray. He was very friendly, answered all my questions, and knew exactly what he was doing. Plus it was affordable!!! I'm going to use there services again to next time I find that damn spider in my house.<//review>

I had just moved into the area and had a cockroach and ant problem. I had called several companies in the area and no one called me back but Jeff called me back within 15 minutes of my message and came over that same day! He was so attentive and helpful. Very reasonably priced compared to other companies. And the best thing of course is that I have not seen even 1 bug since he came. Even the ants around the yard are gone! Thank you so much 1st Response for giving me peace of mind!<//text>

I called 1st Response Pest Control because ants had taken over my backyard and water bugs were taking over the front yard, and I had black widows all over the place. They were able to schedule me quick and the prices were the most affordable I could find. They came out in the late morning, and by that afternoon there was no trace of ants. The water bugs died that night and the black widows are gone too.<//text>

Wow!! So... I found these tiny little nuisances crawling all over our bed (yes where we sleep!) They were all over the window frames, doors, even spying on us in the shower!! I called around to 5 different companies on Yelp but Jeff responded to me WITHIN MINUTES! They were here by the end of day to take care of those pesky lil spider mites (cringe) I slept like a baby last night!! THANK YOU 🙏🏻 they definitely pegged the name 1st Response 👍🏻</Review>

I have a lot of anxiety when visiting dentists. I had tooth sensitivity that was alarming and they saw me the next day and it wasn’t as worse as I had thought. David was very reassuring, I have found my regular dentist finally! Tammy did my deep cleaning and she was great as well. Definitely put me at ease. Every in the front is very friendly as well.<//Text>

My family and I have been going to Dr Park for a few years now. This family practice has treated us like family. All the staff are wonderful! My kids didn’t enjoy going to the dentist until we found Dr Park and his team. The service is always professional, prompt, comfortable, and courteous. Coming in for check ups and dental work during covid wasn’t an issue either, I feel safe with the cleanliness and precautionary measures taken by everyone at this practice. Highly recommend this practice. Will keep coming back.</review>

They were warm and welcoming to me as a new patient. They gave me a short tour of the office and introduced me to some of the staff. Great family vibes. They were very clear in explaining what every procedure and product going into my mouth.

Normally this all might seem frivolous, but I'm coming from a pretty bad experience with UCSF. This experience really helped restore my trust in dentists.</Review>

I was so apprehensive and nervous to go to the dentist during Covid, but I was overdue and the Team at Ingleside Dental made me feel at ease and safe.  They were all so friendly and welcoming.  They did a great job on my deep cleaning.  Dr Park was so nice!  He even took the time to chat with me that wasn’t about dentistry.  I am so glad I found Ingleside Dentist!</Text>

<review>As soon as I entered this dental clinic, I felt I was truly WELCOMED by each staff. The front desk female staff(sorry didnt catch her name) and Richard were sincerely nice and the FD female staff was giving me all information about dentists and that clinic. She made me so comfortable👍 Amazing and genuine gesture, felt that I was in the luxury hotel👍 After that, David Park, DMD genuinely explained  me all information what I should do for my 🦷 This facility was clean and nice to make pt to be comfortable. Definitely will go back whenever I need to have teeth treatment 🤩 THE BEST DENTAL CLINIC SO FAR!</review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Park and the staff are so helpful and friendly. Very attentive and really have the COVID-19 safety protocols down. They have this jellyfish devices to suctions the spray when using the scaling device for cleaning. They are convenient and always pretty easy parking. I love that they use text messages to contact me with reminders and such. And the tv on the ceiling helps me focus on something else besides my mouth being invaded. And if you don’t have dental insurance they have a plan you can join which does provide some discounts and benefits. Thanks Ingleside Dental for taking care of our teeth 😁< /Text>

Dr.Park and all of the staff at Ingleside Dental are amazing! I have been going to them for my dental needs for years and years. I am always greeted with warmth and hospitality when I arrive (even prior to arriving with the convenient reminders). They demonstrate the highest adherence to COVID regulations and I feel completely safe and comfortable when I’m there. They also went through a big remodel not too long ago, so the office is more modern and sleek looking with upgraded top technology. AND there’s a tv on the ceiling! They always are very gentle, concerning and take such great care of me every step of the way.

I highly recommend making Ingleside Dental your new dentistry!< /Text>

Out of all the dental practices I've been to, this is the best one by far. I'm such a happy client coming here. The team is very professional, personable and makes going to the dentist so seamless. I honestly don't love going to the dentist (childhood trauma of having cavities lol), but the Ingleside Dental SF team makes it much more bearable for me. Highly recommend!< /review>

< Review>
Not a huge fan of having to be in the chair (or writing reviews for that matter) but I’m telling you, Ingleside is a game changer!
Right or wrong, I waited this long to go back for a cleaning (pre-covid), avoiding a couple of my biggest fears; dentists and viruses. Turns out Ingleside is second only to my house in terms of comfort and peace of mind.
As far as professionalism, efficiency, customer service, investing in their own business (ceiling mounted/floor facing tv’s, each station having all glass enclosures), top notch staff, parking....
Off the charts!
Best part of all was the cleaning itself, seriously. Not one misstep. The hygienist was super nice, slow, steady, focused, gentle...I almost dozed off a couple times (really!!!). Truly masterclass.< /Review>

My Kid 16yr old said "I didn't feel a thing" lol "Even when the big needle went in, it was only a Pinch!"
Dr Park is A Star and his Staff are equal Star Quality!
Should be 10 STARS~!
~White Filling looks REAL!!!!!!!
~Everything they could reasonably do they did without asking!
~Gave prescriptions, Starbuck gift cards, Gift bags with Yelp review.
~A Great Big Star Rating for The Covid Commitment they have made Keeping everyone safe and clean on arrival!

A-Team with a Great Smile!</Review>

Amazing service. My dentist spent time teaching me how to properly floss. The hygienist and her proactively showed me / offered to show me problem areas in a mirror. The dentist also took her time with me and I never felt rushed. The office is also very beautiful!< /Review>

Dr. Park is the best. Not only does he do great work he also invests in new tools that make his practice better. Recently had a crown fit and instead of the molding putty they make you chomp down on he used a laser 3d scanning tool. The result, the best fitted crown that fit perfectly right off the bat with no back and forth polishing to get the bite just right.< /Text>

It was a very good experience. I had an implant that was moving, has to be adjusted but unfortunately the implant was from a non common brand in the US (it was done in Europe), they took the time to locate a tool to fix it. I am very happy and highly recommend it.<//review>

This is my third times visited the Ingleside Dental office. They’re very friendly. They managed to schedule people to come in for dentist during COVID. I went to Dental Ease in Millbrae for almost two years. I found out Ingleside Dental is located on Ocean Ave so close to my house, and I switched. I liked it! Also, Ingleside Dental located in the area easy to find a parking. Today, 02/01/21 I came in for regularly cleaning. I was inside a room in the far back facing the backyard. It was super cold in the room. Phuong, dental assistant who took X-Ray without asking. She went and closed the window. She’s so kind! Try it out yourself and you might like it.< /review>

I am with Ingleside Dental since 2016. Dr. Park is great and knowledgeable. The staff are very friendly. The facility just remodeled lately. Everything is new and clean. I just had a cleaning this afternoon. They provided great services to keep my teeth clean and healthy. Thank you.<//Review>

This was my first time at a new dentist since moving to San Francisco and I was so happy I chose this one. Before going, I read many reviews and patients were saying how nice the staff was here.. and they were right! I made my first appointment as a new patient by exchanging emails with April at the front desk, she then proceeded to text me to confirm my appt. Tech is up to date, simple to use, and April is sweet and efficient. Arriving to the practice, the COVID precautions were standard: waiting room only held 3 people, sanitizer before entering, plastic shield to protect the front desk workers, and masks on. Since it was my first time there, April gave me a short tour of the place along with good-to-knows about the rest of the staff, it helped me feel comfortable at a new dentist. My hygienist was Katie who was gentle and quick! Dr. Park was fabulous, so jolly and GREAT at answering all my questions. I had a cavity to fill the following day and he did it with ease and precision-- a bonus was the TVs on the ceiling and the tiny chapsticks they give you so your lips don't dry out during your appt (: Also Richard was good at explaining any charges for my appointments and is very clear and concise about payment. Overall, Ingleside Dental gets 10 stars from me so far!! I even have been flossing every day because I want to make them proud!<//text>

<review>I had to wait for a whole hour for a 5-minute check-up!! And this is not even the worst part, the worst part is no one even bothered to offer an apology for wasting my time, not the dentist/owner, not the receptionist!(except the dental assistant). When I showed that I am upset for the long wait, the receptionist (Richard) basically said well this is what you should expect when you have an unplanned visit...( I called at 10am and he offered me a 4:20 appointment without mention a word about the potential freaking long wait!!) so I take time off from my work to come in on time only to sit at your waiting area for a whole hour?! Do your business have any respect for your client's time?!
Btw, this is not a one-time event, I had to wait for 40 minutes each on both of my two previous appointments too.
There are two things that upset me so much here: first is the waiting, clearly the business is scheduling in a way that maximizes the number of clients they can see each day in the expense of their client's time. The second though, is the customer service, the terrible and unapologetic way they are handling an upset (with good reason) customer.
The dental service itself is fine, not bad nor impressive. So if you like an average dentist who does NOT respect your time, they are the dentist to choose.<//review>< user_name>

I’ve been going to Ingleside dental for almost a year now and I highly recommend! The dentists and staff are all so friendly and knowledgeable. I always feel well taken care of. Also, Richard greets me by my name when I come in and that’s always nice :)

The location is really convenient for me, just a couple mins from my house and I always find parking nearby. The office is clean and the rooms are private.</Text>

Alway so nice and inviting. They take good care in making sure you feel welcomed and safe (pre and post covid). If you need a good dentist that won't take advantage of you. This is the place to go!
Its truly a 5 🌟 dentist office and I've been to a few different dentist offices.
Highly recommend Ingleside Dental SF< /Text>

I just got back from my first visit! I am very impressed by the excellent customer service and kindness that everyone has at this office! The doctor was patient and thorough in his explanations and the admin team was very professional and sweet! The hygienist was very thorough in her cleaning and she explained the steps as she was doing them which I appreciated! I like the family vibe and the super clean and organized office! It made me feel that I can trust them! Also, Richard was very helpful and went out of his way to call insurance companies to find my insurance and he explained to me the details of my consult costs! I am definitely going back even if I pay out of pocket because I feel like I can trust everyone in this office!<//Text>

<text>Easily the most pleasant dentistry experience I've had. Richard is always helpful and patient with me. They never pushed me to do anything I didn't want to. And I ended up having to get my wisdom teeth out. And man. The oral surgeon is as great as the dentist's. Easiest procedure. And only went under local as the dentist suggested necessary rather general, which I preferred to hear in the first place. Would recommend this place to anyone.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Date>

<Review>Dr Park and his team are always courteous and professional.  The office looks great after the remodel.  Dr Park is very nice and patient.  He never push for additional work.  He takes the time to explain your options and it’s up to you if you want to hold off or go ahead with procedures.  I highly recommend Ingleside Dental.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>I have had great experiences.  They are all friendly and caring.  They have followed with me to ensure that I was doing well and not in any discomfort after I had my bridge replaced.

Strange as it may seem, it’s always a pleasure to visit Ingleside Dental. Thanks to an emphasis on good preventive care, My wife and I rarely have unpleasant dental surprises. The cleanings are thorough but gentle, and we come away with innovative tips for maintenance and a feeling that we are valued and cared-for patients.<//review>

<review>Best dental office ever! They remember each patients name which is lovely in itself! I’ve been to bigger known dental offices like Western Dental and they don’t compare to Ingleside Dental at all. They make each patient feel like family instead of just another customer...they also take most insurance which is a big plus</review><resp>None</resp><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

It took a while for us to find a dentist and I’m glad we came across Dr. Park! Him and his wife are phenomenal as well as all their staff. Thank you for keeping our teeth cleaned and assuring both my boys are comfortable and neither are afraid to come in and see you! Friendly, welcoming, and always on time :)< /review>

Right when you walk in the door, Richard introduces us and gives us a tour of the facility.   We fill out the forms and right on time we are ready for our cleanings with Dr. Park.    Dr. Park and his assistant Jenny give us a good explanation of the service they provide and equipment they use, and outline what options are available.  No rush, no pressure, and great service.

This was the most convenient dental visit in my lifetime. Richard (office manager) helped me check if my Insurance Plan covered all services I was going in for. Marissa was amazing with the cleaning services and answered all my questions on dental hygiene. Dr Park took out time from his busy schedule and gave his expert opinion on the challenge I have been facing with me teeth. Thank you guys!< /review>

Dr. Park and his staff provide excellent service. I've been coming here since 2014. They are fast and efficient. Always accommodating my busy schedule. My daughter and sister are also patients here and they love them.

Dr. Park is very thorough and takes the time to explain every procedure. I had a very difficult root canal and he made sure I was comfortable and at ease. I definitely recommend him to all my friends and family.

Thank you so much for everything!< /Text>

The Staff and Dr.Park is professional, friendly, and personable. You feel welcomed there! There is hardly ever a wait to see Dr. Park. He usually gets you in and out quickly providing quality service. In addition, the dental office is very flexible with scheduling where you are able to maneuver your schedule around when needed. I recommend choosing Dr. Park and staff as your dental service providers whether it be general dental work or ortho.< /Review>

I hate the dentist but these people are really great. Earlier this year I was in a lot of pain bc I was a dummy and hadn’t gotten my wisdom teeth out & they were growing in really painfully so i scheduled my first appointment with Dr Park bc I didn’t have a regular dentist. They were fantastic, saw me on a Saturday, did x-rays, referred me to a great surgeon & my wisdom teeth were gone by Monday. They are honestly so good and kind & everyone has always had a positive attitude. Also they just renovated so the office is p cool ngl< /review>

As ALWAYS, I enjoy coming to this dental office. Super friendly staff and professional.
From trying different dentist by far Dr. Park & his wife are the best! My teeth feel great leaving there.
Just a little plus, they have fun raffles for there patients and give out goodie bags. 👍 👍< /Text>

<Text>Being a patient at Ingleside Dental has transformed my dental care.
Dr Park has been my dentist for about five years, and my first regular dentist for about 35 years. During those decades, my teeth had decayed; and Dr Park has responded with necessary remedial work: his first task was an extraction with me. He has gently encouraged me to look after my teeth better. He set out a plan during my first few visits of managing the decline which has always felt realistic: this plan has far exceeded my expectations, with very little decline, and significant improvement in my dental health. It is always a pleasure to see him, and I totally trust his brother Richard at the front desk with the paperwork.<//Text>< pictures>

I was in a rush for a meeting at work but, it turned out it was worth every minute to stay back. Time well spent. Thanks you!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Amazing !!!!
I started going there with pain on my teeth. I called they took me and fixed my tooth. I was extremely on pain so after the work was done the next day Dr. Park called me how I was healing. That is excellent customer service and care for your customers. After that I took all my family there. We are more than 100% satisfied with Dr. Park professionalism and service. Please go there and you will be satisfied and happy.
Bty mention I referred you 👍🏻</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

After my first appointment with Dr. Park and the entire staff, I will not go to any other dentist. They really pay attention to the patient needs and try to make you feel comfortable.
Again, i had another appt. and i was not disappointed a bit. Not only their welcome you with a genuine smile but they try to help you in any possible way.
Thank you all</Review>

Thank you to Dr. Park, Dr. Vickie and their entire staff. Everyone there was so friendly and everyone gave me a smile that made me feel really comfortable being in the dentist chair. Although I haven't been to a dentist in a long time, my perception of going to the dentist has changed for the better thanks to you guys! Thank you for a non scary experience!</review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I was in a lot tooth pain when I called yesterday at Ingleside Dental office requesting and hoping to get an appointment to be seen same day which I wasn’t sure to get because I was a new patient and plus I was calling late already it was around 2pm in the afternoon , but thanks God that Richard the office manager answered my call and listened to my request and was able to sympathize and understand the need for me to be seen same day yesterday and made an appointment for me to see the Doctor at 6pm last evening !! When I went to my appointment the whole staff including the doctor, dental assistant , Richard, they all treated me with respect and dignity and they all understood my tooth pain that I was going through and therefore I received the best care that you can imagine !! They are all very professional and caring Dental office !!
I highly recommended Ingliside Dental office  to every one who needs a good Dental Care Team to take care of you and your loved one !!
They are only the best !!!! Thank you every one at Ingliside Dental office for made me feel very special and for taking a such care of me !!
Many blessings 🙏❤️

<Review>Gino was fantastic.  Worked with me over the phone to make sure that my trip to Lions would be worth my time.  He was friendly yet professional.  Thanks for a great car buying experience!  Love our new VW Eos!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3FJLr6jhjCo1vO4zmcl8gVkaxLcUuCGT33caX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5sqvnZ7pVCjEj69pC7UA0tMa3kfBrERQfjZpS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I LOVE LOVE LOVE my 2011 Acura TL I bought from Lion's Auto Sales!!! I haven't had one single problem with it since I bought it 3 months ago.

Even if you have bad credit, no credit, or whatever your situation is... Gino will be able to help you out. Very nice man! Everyone at Lion Auto Sales is very professional and helpful. Not pushy at all.

I highly highly recommend buying your next auto from Lions!< /Review>

Hi everyone! We are pleased to be open with our community regarding our recent purchase at Lions Auto Sales. We recently purchased a Beautiful white 2010 X5 48i and are extremely satisfied with our purchase.  Our vehicle was very clean and it reflects high quality.  Our seller and owner made sure we would drive a safe vehicle and replaced our front and rear brakes and a oil change at no cost to us. Needless to say they were very helpful and friendly with our loan and making sure all of our needs were met. Thank you for the pleasant experience and we most definitely recommend this family owned car sales dealership to other families or people buying their first car. Now we are enjoying our amazing BMW! 😉</Text>

I had alot of anxiety, upon arrival. This was my first car buying experience, and it was awesome. Gino was super helpful and has a great sense of humor! He worked with me and helped me go home with my new (used) Prius. Even ordered head rests that arrived quickly!Thank you !</Text>

Gino is a really good salesman, kind and helpful enough. But I can't recommend buying cars from Gino's dealership. And if you decide to buy a car, then you should make a thorough diagnosis from a mechanic. We were enchanted by Gino's kindness and did't test the car properly, so we had a lot of problems with the car. The repair price turned out to be about 6k and therefore we had to urgently sell the car, less than a year has passed since the purchase. Unfortunately, I DON'T RECOMMEND this dealership.< /Text>

Gino took care of me, he took the time to help me find the perfect car for me and my kids. I brought two cars from him so far and both cars are great. If you looking for someone that will be honest when it comes to buying a car go to lions auto sales and ask for Gino.<//text>

What can I say....Gino made it possible for me to purchase the car I wanted. Before buying a car from his lot, I sent my brother to check out the vehicle for me. While at work, Gino was able to get an pre-approval on the Infiniti Q50 that I want, he made it as easy as it can get. Once I got there after work, we signed the paperwork & out I went with my new car! Gino’s a real gem!! Great customer service, knows what he’s doing & can make your car purchasing as easy as a pea! I would definitely recommend anyone I know to Lions Auto Sales!! Again thank you to Gino & his team!!</text>

<Review>two weeks ago I was looking for a truck especially a tahoe and I called 5 different dealers looking for options until I found lions auto sales who answered me immediately and offered me options throughout the week with whom I had the pleasure of dealing from the first moment shadi who  He made me feel very good from the first text and called his kindness and make a client feel good he is an incredible person with clients and he has been one of the best salespeople that I have met in my life and I am left with a satisfaction to return once  I recommend come to shop to  lions auto sales, thank you Gino for offering us the option of transporting us the day we return, you deserve a 100 in the best costumer service 🙏⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🙏</Review>< pictures>

<Review>They have a wide selection of different vehicles with good prices. They were able to get me financed quickly with no down payment. Even fixed minor blemishes  that I had no problem with and made the car look great. Gino has great customer service and goes above to help and make you satisfied. Had a small problem arise and it was taken care of at no cost, quickly with no worry on my part and even loaned me a car to make sure had transportation. He went above and beyond and made this buying experience my best for sure. I will and would definitely use them again and would recommend them to anyone.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

I have been looking for a car for a month.  I went all over Sacramento, to so many dealerships.  My last stop was lions auto.  Gino was the best!  He was always happy and laughing and kept my husband and I entertained.  But most of all, he was honest! He delivered on his word.  Everything he said he was going to do was done.  He is a man of integrity, which is rare these days, and especially in the car business.  I already recommended my sister to see Gino to purchase her next car.  5 stars isn't enough .  Don't go anywhere else for your car purchase!!! Thank you so much Gino for all of your help... whoever gave that 1 star review is a hater for sure :) 5+ stars all day</text>

<review>Purchased the first car. It was a pos. Died on the side of the freeway. After supposedly being fixed it did it yet again. Got a different car. The moon roof went out the seat broke drove all the way back to Sacramento told they could not fix it and to take it to the dealership and they would pay for it to be fixed. They were supposedly going to order a part and ship it to me. I have yet to receive the part .Now the check engine light it on. Do not waste your time or money. Car salesman Geno seemed nice at first but after first car broke he was very rude and talked down to me. Terrible experience.  Rude sales people, refusal to help. Brakes went out and master cylinder. 1850.00 to repair. less than a year later turbo and wastegate need replaced 3500.00 to repair. Stuck with $10,000.00 lemon. Please I beg you spend your time and hard earned money else where. Worst experience ever.  ohh if I could show you the texts they have sent me.</review>< pictures>

<Review>Gino was absolutely wonderful to work with! My husband and I drove around to the different dealerships on Fulton Avenue for hours with no luck on finding a car that we both liked. As soon as we got to Lions Auto Sales, Gino greeted us and was so helpful. He was very honest about the pricing and conditions of the cars. We test drove a few cars and found one we loved. Gino got us in and out of there very quickly with very reasonable financing. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone!<//Review>< rating>

A very BIG THANK YOU to GINO and the staff for the great customer service. I recently purchased a 2007 Nissan Armada. Gino took great care of my family and I while we were there. The car was in great shape for a used car, and when I brought up some issue that I noticed with the car Gino assured me that it would be taken care of and fixed. I would highly recommend this dealership to my close friends and family. I left feeling very assured.
Thank You Again GINO< /Text>

<text>I had an amazing time purchasing my car from Lion auto sales! Gino was seriously the best! I told him before I arrived over the phone that I had to be out of there by a certain time and he made sure I was out of their even earlier than what he promised me! I didn't feel any pressure when it came to buying the car! Most dealers are just looking out for the best interest of themselves. Gino wasn't this way at all! I wanted a different car that would ultimately cost me way more down the line to fix and he didn't want that for me! It's very rare and hard to find a dealership who isn't just eager to get the sell!!! He was looking out for me and I truly appreciate him for that!! I'm very pleased and happy with my purchase! Every request I had he fulfilled.💕 So if your considering getting a car from here. PLEASE DO! You will not be disappointed at ALL! Thank you so much Gino for all of your help! I'll be back in the future as well when I'm ready for a new car.< /text><response>None</response>< pics>

Gino was awesome!! He was able to get us financed with a monthly payment we could afford. - Even with less than perfect credit.

The car needed new spark plugs and they fixed it right there before we bought the car!!!!!

If you are looking for honest people with great customer service when you are trying to buy a car......look no further!!!
Thanks Gino, we loved your service!!!< /review>

<text>Purchased a 2005 Toyota sequoia 2.5 years ago have had nothing but problems first the stereo didnt work took it back to Sacramento for them to have a mobile mechanic replace it. Then on the way home the check engine light came on and since then its been check engine light after check engine light. Turns out after a massive tire blow out the tires put on the vehicle were over 10 years old. Theres been damage or an accident to the passengers side, but being an unexpecting single mother of 2 looking for a quality SUV with low miles I was easy pickings. It took me so long to write this review because we really enjoy driving it and the third row is awesome so the car itself I love the problems I dont....fast forward to today come to find out the 1 key I was given (promised theyd mail the spare never showed up) is a valet key more money and problems. If your going to respond that I was never I customer Ill attach copies of receipts and finance paperwork. This is an honest review. Take someone that knows what their doing to look at the vehicle your shopping for with you.<//text>< response>

Gino was a great help, he helped me buy an Audi A3 at a greaaaat price. With the condition it's in, it would be considered a steal with how much he sold it to me for. Gino's a great guy with a wonderful personality, I would definitely recommend Lions to a friend.< /review>

I came here to find a car, and I ended up taking a huge loss. This place is disgusting. Gino never holds up his side of the bargain. I felt like I was running in endless circles. He loves to make fake promises, anything to make money,  right? Extremely dishonest. Would never recommend this sham of a place to anyone. He said he would call back to go over the car details and he never bothered to call. They don't care about anyone but money. It's so sad to see money hungry people scam innocent people. He also has family members do ratings and reviews for this place so they have good reviews. Everything is so deceiving. Don't bother coming here people!< /Text>

<Text>Went to over 10 dealerships over the last week looking for a car and it was not at all fun until we got here. Its a family owned business and the brothers were attentive to what we were looking for and found a way to make everything work out just the way we asked. Nice working with car salesmen who have an interest in making the customer happy while making the sale. If you are looking for a car..I recommend you at least stop by and check out the inventory here.. It wasa  super reasonable in price too!<//Text>< pictures>

Thanks to Lions Auto sales and Gino😉 for great customer service. I have been up and down Fulton looking for a 2008 Audi a3. I found three of them in different dealerships. The cars were very clean, but customer service was extremely horrible. I gave up hope on used dealerships until I met Gino. He got me the car I wanted with low miles, great finance with a low monthly payment. I will definitely recommend him to friends and family. There are still honest people out there. Thank you for your honesty and amazing service.< /review>

This was my first time ever buying a car from a dealership. Shadi was very friendly and helpful with the process. He answered all my questions and got me the best deal for my situation.  It was a no pressure experience. All the staff was friendly and helpful also. I would recommend Lions Auto to anyone.</Text>

<Text>Gino was the man. He helped me out with absolutely no pressure, and was able to get the payment I wanted and even filled up the gas tank.

<Review>By far the BEST car lot I’ve ever gone to. Shadi, the owner treats me like family. I bought my car 4/2016 but the length of time that he’s assisted me surpasses that. I bought my car without a warranty, as is but he still takes care of me if there are ANY issues with my car. If he doesn’t have something I need or want he makes sure to get it at his cost and makes no profit off me. He’s AMAZING!! I will NOT go to another dealership again!!! I’d recommend them to anyone anyway.< /Review>< pics>

A few months ago I needed to find a car for my son and we visited Lions.  All I can say is that we had a wonderful experience. We brought the car back because we thought that it wasn't working right...but Gino and crew showed us how some of the accessories worked and all was fine. Gino gave us the same hilarious and warm attention after we bought the car as he did before we bought the car. The team worked with us on our crazy financing and made us not just satisfied but  happy customers. All I can say is be open and honest with them so that they know what you need. Lastly....our used car was a 2010 Accent and it had to be the most immaculate used car we test drove during our car buying adventures...they really try to take care of the details.</review>

<review>Great customer service. Gino was very helpful, gave us all the information we asked for, made sure car was all good to go. Got my payments down by a huge amount and even tried to help get more me more affordable insurance. Car wasn't filled up on gas and he even gave me money to fill it up. If anything were to go wrong I could just come back and he'd take care of it. Very comfortable lounge and nice people who work here! I'd definitely come back!

<review>Very dishonest. No reason to trust them and I would never refer this place to anyone.  They will tell you one price and tell you oh yeah don’t worry I’m going to give you a great deal. They know it is your first car purchase and have never seen a contract before so they act like they have your best interest in mind so you do as they say or they gloss over things. You go back the next day to sign paperwork and they only gave you $180 off of the asking price for a car that has been sitting there for almost 3 months . They like to talk to you like you are old friends but when it comes time to deliver,  don’t expect them to care. They will tell you what you want to hear and pretend they fixed something they said they were “going to take car of -no problem”, when in reality they didn’t do anything. Don’t expect them to reply to you once you drive away with their car that needs a lot of work. Purchased a car less than three weeks ago, one week out of that they had it in their possession to supposedly fix things we noticed before signing papers.  They basically lied and said “oh yeah we checked this and we checked that everything was perfect. “That was a load of BS . Our Car needs to go in the shop and who knows how much it will cost!</review></record>

All thanks to Gino for a great buying experience. I’m a first time buyer and wasn’t too sure about the process, but everything went smoothly with the help of Gino. He’s a friendly and approachable person that I felt comfortable talking to regarding my credit score and income. My wife and I got our first SUV today from Lions Auto Sales.<//Text>

I just bought my first car with the help of my parents from Gino! I bought a 2010 Mini Cooper and it is my favorite car! It gets wonderful gas mileage and it speeds around town!(:The process of buying the car and paper work took all of 10/15 minutes and it was ready at the time they said it would be, detailed and everything! We can't thank Gino enough!❤️<//review>

I was moving to Sacramento and needed a car ASAP. From across the country Gino helped me with getting me pre-approved for a loan. Once I landed he was ready and enthusiastic to show me a few cars he had in mind for me. This is a used car lot so some of the cars can use some work but Gino is no sleeze man. He can honest and prepared. If I need to get another car in the future, Gino is my man.< /text>

We had looked online for weeks for a certain car that my son wanted. We found a few in Sacramento area, so we drove a couple hours from Reno to check them out. The others were a waste of time - car condition misrepresented, rude sales people, etc.  Lions Auto was the best - not just because they had the right car, but the price was excellent.  We didn't even need to haggle or heavily negotiate like at most car lots.  Gino was courteous, knowledgeable, and funny. His laid back demeanor made the deal easy.  He got my son (a first time buyer) financed with great terms and with the monthly payment that he wanted and can afford.  Would have no problem recommending Lions Auto (and Gino!) for a pre-owned auto!< /text>

I drove 70 miles to test drive a car and Gino definitely made it worth my time! Ultimately I found the 6 speed of my dreams at a fantastic price, and they even delivered it to me in Oakland! Did I mention they gave me a 30 day warranty? Shout out to USAA customers. Lions has a great selection of pre-owned vehicles and the customer service to match!</review>

Bought a car from here and Gino treated me like I was family. He made sure when I left I was confident in my purchase and when something went wrong with my car, even though I purchased it “as is” he took care of me. I’d recommend them to everyone I know.< /text>

<Review>Working with Gino to find me and my fiancé a new car was great. We had already been to two dealerships who couldn't help us as we had bad credit. We were exhausted but in need of a car badly as ours had broken down. We walked in knowing exactly what car on his lot we wanted as I had looked it up online already. Gino worked hard to get us a great lender with prices in our price range. Family oriented and so fun to talk to! The process of buying a car can be grueling but Gino made it great! Thank you so much Gino!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>This place is a dirty scam! DON''T waste your time or money here!! Gino is a liar, his real name is Shaddi.  All he does is lie. He sold he a messed up car and won't even own up to it. He DID not disclose any REAL information about the car. He fooled me. Now i'm stuck with a faulty car and stuck with repairing it all myself. So please don't waste your time here with these clowns.</Review><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

Hands down, no question,  best service ever!!!
I bought a vehicle from them.... it's a very nice car, very clean. . But like life, things happen... their ended up being a small issue, not only did they fix it for me ( dud not pay for a warranty ) but they paid for me to have a rental car for 2 days while it was being fixed... at no cost. ..

Best service ever!!!

Working with Gino and Shadi has been the best car buying experience I’ve ever had. I’ve bought cars from BMW, GMC and Dodge dealers in the past and these guys are first class! They were respectful, courteous and an absolute pleasure to buy a car from. Getting financed was easy and I didn’t feel pressured into anything. I will be back here for my next car for sure, but not too soon because I love the VW I just bought!!< /Text>

Gino promised that I would get a small commission for referring a friend. For months made promises, didn't answer phone calls, lied and gave me the run around. Will say anything to get your money! FYI never got gift card or commission.<//text>

<Name>Susan Willis</Name><userid>105303808377165977499< /userid><Text>If I could rate this place,  I would give it a zero. The purpose of a car dealership is to be truthful, honest, and giving your customers your best interest. First and foremost, this place is full of lies. "Gino" or whatever his name is, keeps saying his partner "Shaddi" is the owner. Gino is not even his name and made up this other man "John" to be Shaddi. I came to see a car and he  kept adding these random "add ons". Everything was confusing and a wild goose chase. He is a scammer and liar nor does he care about his customers. So please be careful when buying a car, they might scam you big time.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Walking in from a great comedy show at 10:45 p.m., it takes a second for your eyes to adjust to the dim lighting. The drinks are reasonably priced, and there's space towards the back of the long skinny bar for your group. I ended up sitting facing the door, which means the projected screen playing... Something old?... Was behind me. I probably would have been distracted by it if I'd been facing it.

I had a Paloma and it was pretty good, strong and not too sweet. It fit the crazy conversation we were having on top of it, which is to say it was loud but not too loud to be incredulous at your friend. Not my favorite bar, but definitely not one to avoid, either.<//Review>

I passed through Dalva only to stumble upon a back end integrated bar called the Hideout. It was kinda dark, but pretty chill. We got to hang out upstairs in a red light attic corner with a handful of small tables & chairs. Cocktails were decent. This is a great late night bar for dates or small groups. Will be back soon.<//Review>

Dalva (previously The Fireside), a hole in the wall bar with charm. Dimly lit, save a skylight in the back, and "the hideout" beyond the back room.<//Review>

Bartender said ypu have time 5 mins before last call, then didnt serve us. Then security said 5 mins to leave then poured our drinks out. Probably the worst bar in SF, dont go unless you like wasting $ on weak drinks and poor customer service lame bar run by a team of 21 year old nerds< /Text>

Dalva is one of my favorite bars in the Mission.The best part about Dalva is that it's two bars in one. The Hideout is the bar within Dalva. They serve the most amazing cocktails I've ever had in my life. Other Mission bars might be more trendy like Trick Dog and ABV, and they do have awesome cocktails. However, my local recommendation is definitely The Hideout.<//Review>

Saw someone using their official Mexican ID which clearly states their birth date, dalva said either their passport with a visa or a proof of residency to serve them. They didn’t have their passport with them so dalva kicked them out.</text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Unfortunately we didn't even get the chance to check out the bar as the bouncer Travis was irrationally quick to resort to physical violence when we were confused about showing ID again at the back (unaware that there's a bar within a bar) Prior to entering we showed ID at front so were naturally confused when Travis demanded very rudely to check again. It didn't take more than a minute before he physically grabbed and choked us absolutely unprovoked, giving me no time to even take out my ID. He handled the situation in the worst possible way, having no reason to be extremely unproffessional, irrational, and accusing us of nothing - we were not inebriated or disturbing anyone at all having literally just entered the building. The irrational and downright discriminatory attitude Travis came on with should not be in a workplace and situation where mediating crowds professionally is priority. For the sake of this institution, the crowd, and the other people who work here, I highly urge investigation of this behavior especially if it results in needless, uncalled for violence. That being said I'd be happy to remove this rating once it's looked into, but for this worker to escalate the situation so terribly is incredibly improper and needs to be spoken on. Thank you.</Text>< Pics>

Lori C and I came in for a drink or two between movies at the Roxie and loved the David Lynch decor, very friendly and efficient bar staff and interesting beers. I winced when I ordered a bottle of Pliny only to see the Russian River Damnation on draft but that's on me.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Happyhour every day from 4 to 7 to 4 dollars. The bar develops along the length of the bar, at the end there is another room with music. It is a pleasant and informal place. Wide selection of beers and cocktails.

La Palma Garage Doo'r Repair- Garage Spring & Opener Service and team are spectacular.  They came on time to a repair call, looked and acted professionally, and fixed a very complicated repair quickly and at a fair price.  We have used many repair services over the years for a variety of different appliances, installations and other household items.  There is no question in my mind that American Overhead is the best repair company I have ever worked with.  I would not hesitate to call La Palma Garage Doo'r Repair- Garage Spring & Opener Service- if he could fix all of my appliances, life would be so much easier!!< /Review>

What a great experience I had with this amazing garage door repair company. they came to my garage door issue rescue! My garage door decided to just completely stop working my car was stuck inside I tried everything I was told to do and nothing worked. Luckily it was Sunday. unfortunately that would ruin my day off. LIFE!
I called this company and thank goodness someone picked up and booked an emergency apt. They are local and that's why they were able to come out so fast!
The tech arrived and no lie it took him less than 10 minutes to get the door to open again and then another 10 minutes to pin point the problem and then about an hour to repair the problem. I had not one but two springs pop last night. I needed new ones. I was happy to get my car out and my garage door working again but my wallet was hurting haha.
They have affordable prices and they really worked with me so I could get something budget friendly. thank you</Review>

I recommend La Palma Garage Doo'r Repair- Garage Spring & Opener Service as they have a great price and service. I have use them for garage door replacement twice. Last month they did a custom garage door replacement that a different company walked away from. It did take 2 weeks for the custom garage door to be made but when it was completed they promptly scheduled the install. Thanks for the great job!</Text>

<Text>House Chicken is Fire.
Sesame Chicken is awesome.
Orange Chicken is still damn great.

The portions are 11/10.

Never going to panda express again.
I had to order a third entree, the sesame chicken was really good.. but the orange chicken is a classic yknow?

(Forgot to take a photo before I ate. I was starving.)

It will overfill the belly of 195lb, 5"8 person for 8.99 even at their two entree it would have filled me up.. It's hard not to be a glutton here.< /Text>< Pics>

This work experience is not that good. The Chinese food was cold, which means it doesn't sell as fast. The brown rice barely had  almost no scrambled eggs. Chow mein is dry and has a rubbery feel to it when you chew.  This place won't be a place I would come back.<//review>

Service was quick but food was terrible. Meat contained a very foul smell and taste. When asked for a refund the server denied there being a manager. When confronted more so, a manager was finally called and the refund was given. I do not recommend this restaurant to anybody.<//Review>

Great food. Fresh all the time, of not, ask "where's the next batch" and they bring it right out. Great staff, and for Chinese buffet arrangement, that says alot. They are able to greet you by name after only a couple visits. How many places do that any more?  The dining area is kept very clean and well organized. Overall, this place is great, the service rocks, and the food is perfect.<//text>

Food is good and fresh. Generous portions. I just wish the kung pao/mushroom chicken had more chicken and not so much veggies. Oh and they offer student discount!!!!! Wish more food places did that.< /review>

Bummer in my soup! I've gone to this place several times and have loved their wonton soup.....except for the LAST 2 times. They use nasty chicken (dark meat with fat and ligaments) and won't let you order "white meat only" anymore. I asked for no chicken since it wouldn't be white meat, and my soup was FULL of nasty chicken (dark and white meat with fat and ligaments), 3 wontons and 3 measly shrimp. Huge disappointment because I love their soup's flavor. No water chestnuts this time either. Also, they close earlier than what is posted (on more than one occasion). Won't be going here ever again 🖓< /text>

My experience at The Wok Experience?  Meh.  I've experienced better.

Pros-
Inexpensive prices
Lots of food
Clean environment

Cons-
The food

Whenever I'd head to Ellen's Pinoy Grille for some sisig, I would oftentimes browse around The Wok Experience.  I'd see 20% off for seniors, lunch specials etc. displayed on the windows.  I'm a Panda Express regular, so if I would compare the two, my judgement would be-

The Wok Experience is more a Hong Kong Express than a Panda Express

The food items, while plentiful & more varied than Panda Express, look to have been sitting around for a long time.  Also, nothing looked enticing, like "Ooo, yeah I'll have that!".  Soggy orange chicken, sad looking fried rice, BBQ pork that's tough & generally not appetizing.

Service was okay.  The Wok Experience does have plenty of seating going for it.  Available parking around the shopping center.  Plus, with the aforementioned specials, people don't have to pay much for a meal.  However, Chinese fast food restaurants are a dime a dozen, and the lesser quality ones just don't cut it for me.

When I'm back here shopping at the adjacent Walgreens and looking for something to eat,   methinks I'll stick to my tried and true, Ellen's Pinoy Grille, than go back to the Wok Experience.  Unappealing & not quality-focused fresh food, Panda Express will continue to have my business.  At least they give fortune cookies.</Review>

Rental car Scam! Do not rent here. As you can see from my photos, contract, mileage, and gas gauge. This place rent vehicles out even if the gas tank is practically empty. Both the attendant and the manager could not understand why this is bad service, and bad business. They simply repeated that I should return the car with the same amount of gas. The scam is few people going to drive around with tank nearly empty, take a chance on running out of gas to bring it back at this same gas level. So they know it will be returned with more gas than they rented it to the customer. Scam, scam, scam!</Review>

Great experience at this Enterprise office.  Although very busy, and super hot, Jack Samartin went out of his way to go and pick up a truck for me at different enterprise location.  He was very professional and had a great attitude.  I will continue renting my vehicles from this location!  Thank you Jack and team!

<rating>2<//rating><Review>Initially I made reservations to pick up my rental car from the Glendale Enterprise location but at the last minute when I was leaving my house to pick up the car, the Glendale Enterprise location called to inform me that they did not have a car for me.  This created panic because I needed to drive to the Northern California the next morning at 4am. Fortunately, I was able to rent a car from the Pasadena location which was a great experience with the staff.  However, maintenance service light was on and the cigarette charger did not work.  Also, the weekend holiday schedule forces customers to pay for an additional day.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Car wasn't ready when I arrived.  Had to wait 40 minutes for representative.  It was 100 degrees and only shade was under two tents with 4 chairs (social distancing) which were full of people waiting  and no water (one lady was in trouble because of the heat and no water) or fans.  Once representative arrived and told him wanted a Yukon.  He informed that was a luxury SUV although clearly states on web sight it was a full size.  Didn't matter because they did not have one.  Made me mad.  Finally rented a VW SUV which was fine.  May not use this location again.</review>

<Review>It was a horrible experience never again will i rent a car from here.. They did not have the car I reserved so they gave me an "upgrade" that cost me 15$ more that was a gas guzzler and it was filthy they charged me $880 for 15 days the manager had an attitude when I wanted to know the reasoning for the outrageous price she said there was nothing she can do about it. They also had everybody sitting outside in a hundred degree weather  while they were all inside enjoying the central air doing nothing  This was one of the worst experiences of my life..< /Review>< response>

<review>As usual I have found Enterprise resourceful and accommodating. They are always courteous and eager to help. My last rental was due to an accident and even though the insurance company was taking care of it, Enterprise reached out to let me know that they would have a vehicle available for me and confirmed what time I would need it.< /review>< GmapID>

I can only remember having one issue with them but I guess I was accommodating the best way they could. Now they know me by face and name.

I’m at Enterprice renting my car today. And the manger was not helpful at all. I filled out a form last time I rented a car and they made me do it again a Nd they didn’t have it in the system. The manger is very rude and she always requires you have to have a utility bill I’m never coming back to this location the manger needs to learn people skills because she doesn’t know how to treat customers right at all. Don’t every ask for the manger she won’t help you out.</Text>

<review>Was told they were overbooked on SUVs upon picking up. Then, the minivan I received had a broken touch screen which meant no stereo. Fortunately, they offered a partial refund upon drop off to make up for the issue. While the product wasn't stellar, their customer service was very good. I will come back again and give them another try soon.< /review><userid>104879290703718993061</userid>< gmap_id>

The Enterprise team could not have been nicer. It was a busy time, but they kept things moving. The shuttle driver was charming and professional. I even left my garage remote control in the rental and they had it waiting for me when I came back.< /text>

<text>Initially when I went to pick up my Standard car, there weren't any available. There were also no Full Size sedans available either. I was offered a large Jeep, but I turned that down since I was driving to Utah and needed a car with decent gas mileage.  The representative, Kiran, then found a car at a nearby Enterprise location, but I told him I would simply come back later.  He assured me there would be a car waiting for me. I went back later, and Kiran had a Nissan Maxima ready. I drove the car for a week and it was comfortable, with good gas mileage. Even though my reserved car was not initially available, I ultimately got a great car and experienced courteous customer service throughout.< /text>< Pictures>

If you're looking at whether to rent here or not, my general advice is, shop around. TL;DR I found a better deal at Budget.

PROS: 1.) NICE DRIVER: The person who picked me up was a really nice guy. We had a great conversation. 2.) NOT CROWDED: They weren't too busy or crowded when I went to get the car. 3.) CLEAN CAR: The car was really clean. 4.) TEXT REMINDERS: I got a nice text reminder about returning my car.

CONS: 1.) BAIT AND SWITCH ATTEMPT?  When I arrived, the car I scheduled "wasn't ready" it was sitting waiting to be cleaned. So I was offered a lesser car (less in size & function) at the same rate, or pay more for a bigger car. Seriously? I told them I would wait the 15-20 min for my actual car to be ready.

2.) KNOWN CAR MALFUNCTION, STILL RENTED IT TO ME: Less than 24 hrs of having the rental (a Nissan Sentra), a "malfunction" notification continued to appear on the dash, so I brought the car back. I was told by the sales rep, "This always happens. We asked the manufacturer about this, they say its just sensitive. It's fine to drive. You can keep driving it or exchange for a different car." Obviously I want a car that's not constantly flashing "malfunction", so I was swapped with a smaller Hyundai Elantra. If it was a known issue, I should have been told before the car was rented to me.

3.) DISHONEST PRICES: I got a text reminder, my car was due back the next day, or I could extend my reservation. I called to extend my reservation a week. I'd originally rented the car for 11 days for $337. I was told the price for an extra week was $214.78, I asked "Is that after tax? What's the breakdown" I was told, "Yes this is after tax. Renting for a week was $185, plus tax and licensing fee comes to $214."

I asked about the price of possibly renting for 2 weeks then the price if I kept it less than a week. The price changes and reasons for them were so drastically different and non-sensical I can't even summarize. The sales rep clearly didn't know what he was talking about. So, I said, "Nevermind, I'd just like to rent for the week as originally planned." And suddenly, that $214 price after tax became $238?!? When I asked the rep why the price had changed, his answer was literally, "I don't know." Seriously?!

I told the rep, "Nevermind. I'm bringing the car back tomorrow." I found a cheaper deal at Budget Car for the same dates I'd asked the Enterprise sales rep about. Shop around, folks.<//Text>

My car was ready for pick up and the rep offered a slightly larger car for a low amount which I took her up on when I arrived.

The drop off service was quick and were able to get me out of there in record time. I can’t speak for other locations but ERAC on Colorado Blvd in Pasadena is great. Only one time was there a mishap which I prefer not to think about , I tend to rent monthly so the odds are good in their favor.
Kept it up team! I’ll keep coming back with this service.<//Review>

- I had to wait almost an hour to get the car
- The car was running low on gas near empty.
- The car had bad brakes it shook every time I used the brakes
- I had to wait over 4 days to get the $200 refund from Enterprise’s insurance

It wasn't a pleasant experience and I wish Enterprise could handle things differently next time</text>

<text>I arrived at 9:00AM to pick up my car on Sunday 7-14-19. There was a line of 8 people that quickly grew to a line of almost 20. The process is what is when checking out a car but with only one person working the counter (that’s my gripe) it was painfully slow! I have no idea if this is normal for this location. I do know that Megan the nice young lady that was having to Handle all of this did so with calm and composure! There were some customers that were getting a bit testy. Megan handled it with a level head and even a bit of humor, offering hugs if needed. She is to be commended for the way she owned the situation, worked as fast as she could, and got everyone taken care of. So, 1. Enterprises check your staffing. 2. Be thankful you have an employee like Megan! So 3 stars for the process but 5 stars for Megan!< /text>< Date>

<Text>My family and I have rented cars from Enterprise for many years with no problems. This was my first and last visit to this particular office.

I made my reservation and chose my car like a week in advance. Tried to make a reservation for pick-up and was told to call the day of, but there was a chance that I'd have to find my way on my own. I live close and got myself to the office no problem.

Once there I expected a deposit but not the full payment of the rental ontop. Never have I paid for the full amount. I was told by another customer that this office does that. I had the money so I went through with the reservation. Walk outside and my car model was nowhere to be seen. None of the customer's cars were ready as they showed all of us the same 4 available vehicles. They tried to put me I a huge truck. I had to wait almost an extra half hour for a car to be washed and ready. Returning was easy enough but I had to get myself home as well.

Kids, meaning adults in their 20's are running this office. And while everyone was nice enough, I don't know that they understand the urgency and accuracy that is needed to run this business. I've been told there is another Enterprise nearby, and that is the office I will stop into next time, and or finally rent from another company altogether.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I love this Enterpise Rental location!!! I receive outstanding service every time I rent a vehicle. I have been a frequent renter as well as a Enterprise Plus member for approximately two years. This location has the friendliest and professional staff around! I can trust the staff to provide and ensure that I'll drive a great car that's suitable for my needs and reasonably priced! Extra special thanks to: Adam Deleon and Kevin! You're the best!!! A special thanks to all of the staff for magnificent team work!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

Had a reservation for Saturday 12:00 pm. I show up on time and half of the staff takes lunch break. I wait 50 minutes and the person showing the car tries to give me a dirty car. So I wait for the car wash guys to come back from lunch, finally get the van dripping wet! By this time I just want to get out of there. I get home and they didn't vacuum the back seat and floor! Water bottles left in cup holders and the worst part was the next morning we leave early and the inside of the windshield was so dirty I could hardly see driving east into the sun! Had to pull off the freeway and clean the windshield with bottled water and a sock! I have always used Enterprise and was happy until this incident. Still upset about the experience. I am a preferred member but I guess that means nothing. Guess I should start trying the other rental  company's.< /text>

They have the best prices on rent-a-cars, period. Staff is very friendly, even during stressful times where many customers are waiting. The only thing not perfect about them is that when you call, they do put yoy on a long hold time.</Review>

<Text>My personal car was damaged during  the last Santa Ana wind. I needed a car for three weeks and after some comparison of rates went to Enterprise. Fairly busy place but Herbert, the Assistant Manager, was very polite with all the customers and was entertaining, good dialogue.  Rental paperwork goes quickly, a choice of four cars, picked the one without the spare on, odd, and was shortly on my way. Checked in three weeks later by the gracious and lovely Emeline , and with computer in hand was gone in :60 seconds. I know where to go after the next wind storm.<//Text>< name>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Double-Dipping – Enterprise just charged me (October 2017) for a rental back in June of 2017 that they also received payment from Ford Dealership. This office is horrible. I received a message from a Meghan on my phone saying they have been in contact with Ford and that Ford is processing payment but they still charged me anyways. Meghan and Q are of no help. Now I have to fix their mess. I already have a job I don’t need to do yours as well.  Horrible!!

June 2017 - Enterprise is quick to close out your account once you return the car. My card was charged before even speaking with me. I received a voicemail saying it was charged and they never informed me of the amount. They ended up over charging me by $250. Mike the local manager was able to credit back my account but it would have been nice to give my authorization before charging my card.< /text>< name>

<GmapID>0x80c2dcab414b47bb:0x48a90a5933eb29d< /GmapID><Text>I needed to rent a car at the last minute for the weekend. On Friday, I checked several local Pasadena car rental places but they were wiped clean of inventory. Enterprise not only had vehicles in stock, but also texted me that I should arrive earlier than my noon appointment due to the fact that there were a lot of customers arriving around noon and it might be a bit of a wait.  I gladly arrived early and, although there were still quite a few people there renting cars, I did not have to wait long at all. Customer service was efficient and professional with a personal touch! And I was able to score an upgrade... how sweet is that? While there are one or 2 other car rental agencies a little bit closer to my home, it's worth the extra couple of minutes drive to Enterprise when I need a car rental.< /Text>< Time>

Need to wait almost hour and half to just picking up a rental. Car reservation made a week before and arrange to pick up at 9am, got here at 8:30 and have to wait another hour and half till the car is ready.
There is no excuse for this kind of delay, car maintenance need to be taken care on company time NOT on customer valuable time.
Very dissatisfied with customer services.<//review>

I have tried all the Enterprise locations in Pasadena,Ca at one time or another.They have a high turnover of employees but this day,the service was good..On Sunday,July 26, I rented a car at this location and was pleasantly surprise. It was crazy busy but Gabby(assistant manager) and the staff was calm and professional.
The only practice I don't like is when you enter to rent a car,they take your name,you sit,they call you up ,take all your information then you sit again ,then someone calls you up to go out to the car,I would prefer them to complete one entire transaction instead of having everyone sitting there waiting,especially if the car needs to be cleaned(which drives me crazy,if you have a reservation ,a car should already be cleaned when I get there,in the past,I have had to wait for them to wash and vacuum a car and have missed an appointment.
When I returned the car on Tuesday,I told the manager how great the service was,he was mildly impressed.< /Text>

<review>I have been renting a car for the last 3 months. The customer service always brings me back.
Davis your manager at this office is fantastic. He is willing to go the extra mile to meet my needs. He greets me by name always with a smile and positive attitude.
Having worked retail for many years, he is a definite asset to your team in Pasadena.

Thank-you for letting me have such a positive experience. I tell other people I could go elsewhere, but the customer service is what keeps me coming back.

Thanks again,
Michelle Rodgers</review>< Pics>

I have rented at this Pasadena office before and never have I had a bad experience. The staff has always been courteous to me and very professional. I don't know of any other Car Rental  CO that picks you up and then takes you back.This last time I rented, the keys to the van that they had for me were misplaced, the agent that was taking care of me right away replaced it with another van and had it washed and vacuum to my satisfaction. I will recommend this Enterprise to my friends and family. Thank you Pasadena /1890< /text>

<Text>Have rented a car here a few times in the past month. Each time with varying numbers of customers within the building. With that said, each time was very quick, they made a point to get things done quickly and everything was smooth and easy. I had to request a ride home one of the days and without hesitation they did so, and even helped with our luggage. Excellent customer service.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

This is a really great group of young kids who are always friendly and professional.  I'm a regular Enterprise customer.  If you avoid picking up on popular days (Fridays and Saturdays)...the wait isn't bad.  Otherwise plan for up to an hour especially if you are renting the cheapest cars with the weekend $9.99/day promo.  Dropping off is usually pretty fast.  Cars are clean and in good shape.  They really try to please you.  And yes they do give you a ride (but sometimes it's a wait). If you turn your car in late, make sure to check that you got pro-rated for the day or ask them to waive it.  They are fair.<//Text>

I rent 1-2x per week from this location. Their customer service is excellent: prompt, professional and friendly. It usually takes about 5 minutes to pick-up a car and less than 5 minutes to drop off. Very efficient, and the rental rates provide excellent value.< /text>

<rating>1</rating><review>I used to love Enterprise, they always have good customer service. BUT, I couldn't believe they hire those terrible employees to serve in Pasadena area. I should have read the reviews before I choose this location. The customer service sucks!!! They didn't want to provide me free pick up because I'm a little out of their service area. That's not the worst part, they refused to drop me off after I return the car. So I called the taxi which cost me $25 to get home because of the traffic. It is only 5 miles and they even didn't want to drop off  their customer. I don't think I can find any worse customer service in the world. Never come back to this F location again!</review>< pictures>

I experienced very courteous, professional service at Enterprise Pasadena that has been consistent, even during their busiest times, and among all staff members.  I was most impressed that each one took added time to seek the best rate and maintain the lowest costs before and after each transaction to accommodate my needs, despite shortness of staff, inconvenience regarding drop offs, and without question. They processed everyone's transactions quickly and were kind and respectful throughout. I always look forward to working with Enterprise. They have made all my rental experiences run smoothly, and happen without delay or hassle.<//Text>

<text>Joseph at the Colorado Enterprise is full of excuses & no follow call to resolve issue. I waited on phone for 30 minutes someone picked up the phones twice & placed back on hold. Hung up & called back Joseph claimed the phones were down for 2 hrs. He was lying because my son was there at the location trying to get another car because the one that they provided to him on Saturday has a malfunction. My son said they only had two people working in the office. I will be calling my claims agent first thing in the morning and go somewhere else that provides professional quality service.
They let my son leave with a malfunction vehicle because I needed to redo paperwork all over again. They never did a proper service or check on the vehicle.

What type of customer service is this?</text>< Pictures>

Friendly service. I was pleasantly surprised that my own car was ready for pick-up sooner than expected, and had just filled the gas tank to more than full. I appreciate getting credit for completely filling the tank with gas when I thought I would have the rental car longer.  Great experience.</text>

Made reservation online a week ago in advance. We showed up half an hour before pickup time. They said wait would be about 45 mins. After that it was another hour because car needed oil change, as if that is an excuse. Maintain your cars on company time, not customers time.< /Text>

It is very hit or miss here.  When busy (weekends, Mondays) expect to wait a LONG time.  On returns, make sure you get everything out of your car else you won't get it back (as I unfortunately found out with a pair of initialized Tiffany cuff-links that I called on 2 hours after dropping off the car).  Their lot is too small to process the volume they have.  Last rental I had to take a dirty, engine-light on Jeep as that was the only one they could get out due to the Monday AM flood of returns.  Still price is right when done via Costco & if you can do your rental mid-week it is great.</Text>

What a shame….Been renting out of this Pasadena location for a few years now. NO more.
I have been a loyal customer of Enterprise no matter where I traveled in the U.S. Out of the 25 years plus of being an Enterprise customer I have always been received with a smile and a hello!
I have highly recommended Enterprise to family and associates because of the great service and overall friendliness of the staff at every location I’ve visited. Unfortunately as long as Meghan is the manager at this branch I will avoid renting here and let everyone know of how badly she behaved towards me and just about every customer that walked in while I was waiting for my ride back home.
This location is farther from my house by more the 2 miles than another Enterprise office (and other rental agencies) but the staff and atmosphere made this office my go to place for goods cars and great service. Walk in there now and if Meghan is behind the desk everyone working there looks apprehensive to say the least. No hellos….No Good Mornings….No Smiles. What a shame.
I never did get a rental that day. I dared to challenge Meghan on a problem trying to rent and she simply said “I’m sorry…we won’t be renting to you today” …Yep…that’s what she told me…not kidding….Felt like I was in an episode of Seinfeld. Meghan seems to have mastered the art of saying FU in a nice melodic little girl’s voice.
To add insult to injury she told me I have only rented from Enterprise once 9 days ago……25 years Meghan!
Anyhow…I decided not to let one self-righteous employee ruin the whole barrel. Still love you Enterprise but PLEASE rescue your customers and employees from a bad apple.
Try a secret shopper and you will see for yourself.
Most of the previous positives below are before Meghan. My guess is if she sticks around not so good.</Review>

I rent cars around the world, but this place is my local store.  They are walking distance from home and work; and I rent cars from them when friends or customers are in town and I need something bigger or newer.  They always come through with a nice car at a reasonable price.  I'm lucky to have them in the neighborhood.

One representative  spent a whole half hour chatting on her cell phone organizing a party with her friendsI while I sat waiting for my car.  The rest of the staff acted as if they were still in Middle school.  They definitely need to hire more professional staff .  That said the representative who looked after me went out of way to make sure I was satisfied with the car so Kudos to him.</Review>

I’ve rented about 6 cars from here for work. I’ve always had great customer service. The cars can be a little banged up though and the last one smelled funky. Note: I always get the cheapest car. So that probably has something to do with it.< /Text>

My experience has been great.  Sales people are very friendly and extremely professional.  I rated it 4 stars because Enterprise took away the $9.99 special until Labor Day,  which is hard for me because of my budget.  I will probably not be using Enterprise Rent-A-Car until the special comes back.  Thanks so much!</Text>

They have you on hold forever!!! I had to hang up and call back, and they still had me on hold forever. Does anybody know how long it takes for them to refund the amount left over from your deposit to your card?

Yea, this place is absolutely HORRIBLE with answering their phone. They kept answering without answering and placing me on hold. If you live far, I feel bad for you because you will NOT get anybody on the phone.</Review>

<Review>I've been very happy with the customer service in the San Fernando location where I always get my rentals. I decided to drop off my rental in this particular location as we were near by. I was a little disappointed that they only had 2 people working as they were very busy and even more disappointed they took care of 2 clients first before me when they have gotten there after me. Also, no one have ever mentioned that there is a $30 dls fee when you drop it in a very location. Hope they get a better way when returning cars even if they are super busy.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1481186242528, 'text': "We're listening and would like to know more, Alejandra.

The entire staff is amazing. They are the ONLY place I rent a car from. I just became Platinum due to the EXCELLENT customer service they give. When renting a car you should get a nice relatable car with a great weekly rate that fits yur budget. The folks always make the experience problem free.

Kindly,

I was simply trying to inquire if they had a bigger car than the one I rented from a different Enterprise. I ended up having to get the Disability Division of Enterprise to make the call for me as I waited on the line. The employees of this facility are unprofessional and insensitive. I will never use them and do not recommend anyone else to.</review>< Pics>

<Text>I rented an SUV here which had damage to the roof. I never thought to check the roof when i did my walk around. When i got back the employee who received it pointed out the damage. In the three days i had the car I never had any luggage on the roof or anything. Yet they insisted that because it was not marked down on the tablet the damage MUST have happened when i had the vehicle. They took my two hundred dollar deposit plus an additional $300. According to the area manager Jason Barrass the employees who did the walk around and the car wash people all inspected the vehicle before I took it and none of them reported any damage. Be very very careful when you do your inspection the employees are oviously not.</Text><rate>1< /rate>< time>

<text>Been renting from this location for many years. since this new manager took over, this enterprise has gone downhill. very rude and condescending. they started charging 2.5x what every other enterprise charges for the same vehicle. I will not be coming back here anymore. there is a hertz walking distance away with way better deals. everyone else isn't as bad but enterprise made a horrible decision hiring her. You will lose all of your loyal customers as you lost me.</text>< Pictures>

I am in town for business. I reserved a pick up for 12 noon. After 2 hours of waiting I tried calling the store multiple times. It goes to voice mail. Everytime.  My trip is now ruined because I have no vehicle to drive around.  I call customer service and all they can offer is the stores telephone number that I've already tried calling.

No call backs. No information.    Now I'm left stranded.    Very very unprofessional.  If you want to waste your time.  This location is good you you.<//text>

I was hesitant to rent a car from Enterprise cause of the reviews I've read on Yelp and Google, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. The process is fast and easy. I reserved a car online so when I got there I only had to wait in line for a bit then they ran my card and waited for a bit while they pull up the car for me. I got a really new car which was clean. They also clean their cars right after you return them so it's not all gross for the next person. I tried another car rental service and I was disappointed. I'd definitely come back to Enterprise!<//text>

< Review>
Staff at this location was great but it took a lot longer to get a vehicle from this location than I'm used to. I was expecting the vehicle to be ready once I got to the rental office to finalize the paperwork.  They seemed to have some vehicles ready and available at this location but I still had to wait several minutes (30+ mins) for the staff to get the vehicle ready.  I used to travel a lot for work and I'm used to getting a vehicle within a minute of checking in at the rental location (and with another rental company, I usually just walk up to the vehicle that's pre-assigned). It may be unfair to compare this local location to one of their airport locations but it shouldn’t take this long to get a vehicle for a customer, especially if they already received the customer’s information beforehand, and if confirmation was already provided that the vehicle will be picked up at a certain date/time.< /Review>

The tank was full of gas which was greatly appreciated since we picked up the car early and were anxious to get going. Check in was quick as well. Although Enterprise offers pick up to their site, we did not need it as we live within a couple miles of the rental place.

I reserved a cargo van for a week when I went to pick it up I was told they do not rent Cargo vans they had a regular van for me . My friend had dropped me off to get the Cargo van . I asked does everything on the van work and if they could set up my phone on bluetooth . The key was in the ignition . I drove to my friends house I could not start the car I. called road side service they told me they would have the car towed to lax and no guarantee I would get another rental . I called auto club they got the van started I was driving in pouring down rain the back windshield wiper blades and defrost didn’t work I got a text from Enterprise asking me how the rental was I informed him of everything that happened and I wouldn’t rent from them ever again . I got over charged I was late for my appointments I had . Customer service hung up on me after I asked to speak to a supervisor .< /Text>

I call them on a Saturday around 12:30 they said they closed at 1pm so you have an half an hour, I told them that unfortunately I couldnt make it and they said they will be open on Tuesday, today I find out they were open until 12pm and called around 11:40 and was closer to them than I was yesterday and the lady the phone tells me that the last reservation was 15 minutes ago. I told her I called yesterday and no one told me your open, she said stop yelling at me and hung up the phone, first of all I wasn't yelling at her and it sounded like she was hurry to go somewhere, called back twice and , they answered said one second , put me on hold. I really needed to rent a car. Horrible customer service and not the first time. NEVER AGAIN!!< /text>

I pick up the Car on Feburary 26, 2019, and the registration sticker is still December 2018, expired. Now I have to go all the way back to deal with this. The inside of the car is messy and dirty, you can see the chip crumbs or whatever the last driver was eating all over the place , even drink spilled on the seat.< /Text>

I have used this Enterprise repeatedly, and have always been more than satisfied with their service.  They are very friendly and efficient.  I will return every time I need to rent a car.</text>

<text>While waiting for repairs on my vehicle I decided to entrust enterprise with providing me a reliable and affordable ride for the duration.  I went with the $279 weekly "special."  Rent five days and get two free...how can you go wrong?  Upon returning the vehicle I was charged $640 PER WEEK!!  Had I been given the true numbers from the beginning I would not have rented the car more than two days. I was falsely informed and deceived and here I am out $1300. I could've taken that $1300 and put it on top of the trade-in value of my current vehicle and got a brand new car.  Beware of liars and thieves since stealing money from people so you don't have to work for it yourself has become the American way... this is what I fought for?< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user>111074213398066862114<//user><Date>1504902625274< /Date><username>Ryan Mazon<//username><rate>1< /rate>< resp>

Great staff ... Worked extra hard to please.  Made a reservation for the following week and they made every effort to note car preferences. 😎<//Review>

Enterprise car rental tells me I can't change out a extremely odorous vehicle without going back to the location that I rented from. What is the purpose of renting from a national rental agency that can't manage rentals between different locations? I will never rent from enterprise again.< /text>

Twice I had car problems within a week and had to rent a car without any notice.  I suppose since I'm not picky about cars or being to particular about it being 100 percent clean, I was in and out of there both times within 20 minutes.  Staff was courteous and gave me a ride home both times - and the conversation wasn't even that awkward heh.</Review>

<Review>Never have had a problem getting a car in the morning without a reservation during the week. If you're getting a car towards the end of the day, best to make a reservation. The only complaint is how pushy some of the reps are with the add on insurance.</Review>< Pictures>

<user_name>Bernard Kane</user_name><text>This is a busy location! They have had to expand their hours to include Sundays, due to the crush of business. And that might explain a few things.
1. My car, a VW Jetta, was in fine working order. The check engine light was on before it was rented to me, and it did give me some concern throughout the trip, even though it performed perfectly.
2. The return process was very slow. It was a busy time, I understand that, but even so! My wait to get my paperwork was over 30 minutes. I interrupted the flow to inquire if I had been overlooked, and I was corrected that my name had been called. Don't correct me; I'm the customer. I wasn't rude, or loud. I whispered so as to not cause any scene or embarrassment. Besides, which is more likely: that I, who had only one purpose while I was waiting - to hear my name and respond - would miss my own name, or that in the crush of business the counter people, being human, would make a mistake and overlook me?
3. If all I need is paperwork, offer to email it to me and let me go. Can't be that hard to do.

Otherwise, it all went well. Pricing was good, hours were observed, checking in to rent was quick enough. It's a convenient enough location, but there is a real dearth of parking, and the street is too busy, generally, to allow a left turn from the rental lot.<//text>< pics>

Have been waiting for a refund that I've been told will get processed but hasn't for 2 weeks. Rented the car from April 21st-24, and was billed wrongly but didn't see it until I left. Called within 30 minutes, and was told by a worker that they would notify the manager. Called the next day again, and was told managers don't come in on Sundays but will be forwarded to manager. Didn't hear anything for a few days or see any refund. Called again on Thursday and was told it would be given to the manager because they're the only ones that can authorize the refund. Still didn't see anything on Tuesday and so I called and the lady said she didn't see any refunds on my account and was told she would give me a call back within 24 hours after talking to her manager because her manager was "busy". More than 48 hour goes by and still nothing.. I call on Monday and some guy told me they're busy and they'll call me back or i can call back in an hour. Feeling frustrated, i called customer care and was told they see no refunds being processed. Filed a complaint with the district manager... Called the branch to speak to local manager and AGAIN, she's not there..... Nothing gets done in this office & just very unhappy with the service. Was not my 1st time renting from this location.</Text>

<date>1443899047919< /date><rate>3</rate><Review>Vehicle was fine. The only issue was the customer service representative who showed me the car.

She marked that it was 1/4 tank when it was halfway between the 1/4 line and empty. Not to sound cheap, but on a 15 passenger van with a 30+ gallon tank that's some extra gas I had to put in. On top of that, she asked if I wanted "Basic" or "Full protection" when there were four options on the form. All I ever get is the Damage Waiver. She rolled her eyes and was less than friendly when I didn't want more than that protection. I get it, Enterprise wants you to sell more protection but that's not how you're going to do it.

3 stars because the other employees seemed friendly and the service was quick.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I've rented from this location a number of times, as well as other Enterprise locations.  This one is by far the worst.  Despite making reservations well in advance, the cars are ready less than half of the time when I arrive.  Only after complaining do the employees decide to go get the car ready, as it apparently goes on their work record if they receive complaints.  They also accused me repeatedly of smoking in a car, and I do not smoke at all, nor does anyone who rode in the car I rented.  Not sure that I'd go here again if another location has similar prices/cars.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

While the service was very good and the car is nice. I have a problem with Enterprise storing my old credit card information and not updating their billing system with the latest credit card I entered through their website. I was told by one of their employees in the past that they do not store any credit card info on location. Which is not totally accurate as that same location was holding on to an old credit card info of mine that did not go though at the time of payment. Why is Enterprise requiring a client to fill out payment information (credit card number expiration date etc..) that they do not update where and when it matters? Isn't that just extra liability to Enterprise with the potential of financial hacking for the client?
I will check for your response periodically.

I just experienced the car-rental-from-hell thanks to the 1890 East Colorado Enterprise office. The car I rented from them died as I got on the 210 Freeway - no acceleration - while I was on my way to a business meeting on May 17, 2016. I was able to coast off the freeway and the Enterprise roadside assistance had AAA tow me back to the 1890 East Colorado office where they refused to give me another car. Other people without reservations came in while I was there and were rented cars! Not only that, I was told that they would not accept their dead car back and that I would need to be towed to the Burbank Airport Enterprise location. So the Enterprise roadside assistance called for a flatbed truck to pick me and the dead rental car up from the 1890 East Colorado office and tow me to the Burbank airport. This is the worst customer service I have ever received from a rental car company - and it's my last Enterprise rental! I would give them negative stars if that was an option.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1466112927874, 'text': 'Thank you for your review, Ellen.

This is the first time I have had a bad experience with any Enterprise in any state or city. Usually it is a no hassle transaction but not at this location. It appeared at first that the employees were professional and courteous then from then on out everything  went downhill. To my surprise I had to wait to have my rental car washed then I waited for a long time before they got around to it. Due to a problem with my reservation, I decided to cancel. The clerk stated that she canceled my reservation but I would find out afterward that she did not which made it hard for me at the time to have my redemption points redeposited. I have addressed this issue to area management and hope they make the improvements but honestly I won't be back to find out.< /Text>

Will not return to Enterprise.  Employee surveying vehicle did not notice damage already on vehicle that I rented, later insisted that I was responsible for said damage to the tune of over $1,000!  Employee who had me sign rental agreement did NOT  clearly explain damage waivers either,  was instead twisting my arm to just pay for extra insurance (which would have been almost $30/day more, as opposed to half of that for damage waiver).  At another Enterprise, a close friend rented a car that was not cleaned on the inside, and the remains of a smoked joint was left there, along with a bit of trash and a cd left in the cd player (was with friend at the time and saw all this).  Obviously there is a quality control problem in terms of Enterprise's customer service.</text>

<review>However they pretend to be good but don't respect customers like turn giving actually they have no reservation rule in practice so don't waste your time so you should walk in and when you are there you should choose your car not them and check their list yourself because they don't care and respect your time and turn!!<//review>< response>

Art aka Ray Donovan was very nice, helpful and took care of me right away. Jason took me out to look over the van and upon my return gave me a ride home. Davis helped me when returning the van. Super nice and a quick return. He even found my running shoes in the van and returned them to me. Great staff,customer service and no complaints. Thats how all buisnesses should be run!

<Review>I am very disappointing Enterprise in this location. I reserved a car and then called them for a pick up. They said someone would go to my address as soon as possible. I waited for half an hour but didn't see anyone to pick me up. I called them over and over again, but the customer service just told me hold on and listen their advertisement. The customer service sucks!!!< /Review><UserId.>102879137257511048796< /UserId.><Date>1442072943558</Date><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

This place can get super busy on the weekends since it's basically the only one in the area open after 12pm on Saturday AND open on Sunday.  Despite the crowds at times, the staff does a great job making sure the customers are taken care of.<//Review>

Staff would not accommodate my pickup to or from the repair shop at a specified time citing they could not have an employee wait for me. Instead, I needed to call them when I arrive at the repair shop and wait for them, which I did for 30 minutes. Customer service at its finesr. The vehicle smelled like an ashtray and I later learned it leaked oil all over my new paver driveway. I am still waiting for corporate to return my call after 4 days for resolution of damages. Interesting how they inspect with a fine tooth comb for damage to the vehicle but can't seem to be bothered with my damages. The good news is it was only $195 per day for my suv - such a deal. Never again!< /text>

<Time>1459715011680<//Time><Rate>1</Rate><review>After the service I have received over the phone from the enterprise I will NEVER rent a car from them. I have been having car trouble and I call AAA and had my car towed yesterday and since it was so late they suggested I call back in the morning and set up a reservation. AAA sent up a reservation and said that she had just spoke to the Enterprise and that they could send someone to pick me up to contact them directly. So I called Enterprise and I got a man on the phone asked to have them pick me up he said hold on a min put me on hold and then picked up the phone said nothing but you could hear people talking in the background and he hung up on me. I called back a woman answered and I said I had just been hung up on and I need to be picked up she said oh well we dont do pickups this late. I said i just got off the phone with AAA and they said you would. She said No we don't I asked to speak with a manager and I was left on hold for 10 mins. When i called pack they had turned the phones off.
They customer service here is absolutely appalling!! They worst part is the hold music that says how they pride themselves on customer service and going the extra mile. Ya the extra mile of being rude horrible compassionless jerks. I cant believe this happened.</review>< Pics>

suggestion: don't book over the phone.

i was booking online, called for a question and ended up booking over the phone. i requested an email with the info regarding what i had booked and agreed to pay for, never got it. called to request it again, they said they'd send it. called again (hadn't got it) and they said they couldn't until i payed. kind of weird.
anyway, after i return the car i got an email from them with the price i payed which i think was higher than what i had agreed to pay, they claimed prices change on a daily basis. this sounds acceptable, but not if i book in advance!
i was not happy because if i would have received the email i originally requested then i could have compared the prices and made sure that i was being charged correctly.

also had to inflate tires on the trip. could have been because i drove from LA to arizona and it got colder there, but i don't think pressure in the wheels drops enough for that unless it was low in the beginning. nothing hard to do but i didn't expect to have to do anything to a car i get for a week. expected a discount or something for my troubles, got nothing.

the rest all good, car worked fine, they picked me up and dropped me back at home quickly.
and dropped me off so, it's ok.< /review><UserId.>103530989756129964055</UserId.><date>1410315754308</date>< Rating>

Seems like they have cut way back on help & all new service representatives.

Wait time for picking up car was over 25 minutes & it took almost 40 minutes to return the car.

Next time Avis!</text>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>I use to really love coming here for rentals. Everyone is generally super nice and hard working. My last couple experiences were of renting with Enterprise was extremely stressful. I had to switch vehicles 4 times over the course of about 2 weeks due to repairs that were needed. Unfortunately the rental vehicle mechanical problems effected my work where they didn't believe me. I was suggested by customer service to take my vehicle to the Burbank location to exchange where I drove 5 mph fo a very very long time since it was New Year's Eve and all tow company's, AAA, and enterprise didn't haven't have any onsite workers to help. Arriving at the airport location, the employees lied to me and told me no cars were avaible. I check online and found dozens avaible unreserved. Possibly in anger for being caught lying the employee only gave me a different car with a new booking at a high rate rather than just transferring the damaged vehicle. He the gave me an SUV with a damaged mirror and other problems. He then took the the damaged vehicle which he said they couldn't touch until the tech was back and screeched out the lot and out the facility off grounds home...that's where he told me he was going. He actually shredded my old receipt which was unrelated to the new booking and didn't even give me a new receipt. I called the Pasadena to let them know and switch the SUV finally a dependable economical functioning suv. They promised me a refund on multiple days of the rental and a Future free rental AND 100dollar voucher to out towards an additional future rental. They have no honored it...they've told me that the "voucher" code I was given is merely my old reservation. All employees have basically seemed to brush off what happened and left me payinf for soemthing I didn't get with no sincere apology or compensation. I actually lost my job because of this, had to stay in a hotel which I paid for because I was stranded, and regressed in my medical issues from discourse it out in my life. Everyone here works so hard it makes me difficult to be mad because eveyone is so caught up and they just forget and it's just hard to keep track of everything and make eveyone happy. Bottom line though...I'm a very patient and understanding plus forgiving but enterprise has truly disppointed me and give me the impression that every large company no matter what is always about just maximum profits as the expense of both employees and clients. I hope we can make a difference in the future through sharing stories like this.<//Review><Date>1474292088385< /Date>< Gmap_id>

When I have the rental car stolen and I went to police station reported they told me enterprise had to report a car stolen enterprise said I had to. Then when I was trying to get ahold of enterprise be kept hanging up on me when I answer the phone for me on hold forever I asked them to for a copy of the cold outside agreement and that's all I still nothing yet there a rip off and love you do you not use your own insurance for the rental cars if something happenscar you're basically screwed< /Text>

I have been renting from enterprise for 4 years and I have not been disappointed until now. When I walked in I was greeted and ask if I was returning or picking up. I said picking up. The representative who helped me out stated that enterprise rate for cars was $ 85.00 a day. I kindly told him that was expensive for a car, and I never paid that price a day at enterprise a day in my life. He said I'm sorry, but unfortuanately that's our set price. Instantly he asked for my name and I gave it to him. As he was looking me up in the system a familair face walked in, and asked me how was I doing. I told her fine and we had a brief conversation. The representative looked shocked, and he suddenly became friendlier. He said Mr.Davis last time you rented from us you had a vehicle for 38 days. I said yes, I did I rent from enterprise all the time and i spend a lot of money. The representative then told me that I can get the car for $ 38.00 a day, but the insurance was going to be $ 23.99 for basic protection. I was in a rush because I had a turn around trip to San Diego that was last minute and it was really pouring down raining , so i paid it. I am not satified with enterprise this time around and the car that I recieved had a busted speaker on the right side of the car, so i was not able to listen to music on my trip. If i did turn the radio or aux all you heard was static mixed with music. I gave this review 2 stars because all representatives should treat customers the same when they walk throuh the door. They should not put prices sky high because they trying to get over on you to meet their sale quota. Usually my reviews is 5 star but this was not okay.<//text>

< Review>
i hired a large SUV for holiday purposes, staying with family in locality, since we are UK/IRISH  family we wanted total US car experience, at every stage i was treat with  courtesy and respect, understanding my needs and travelling i was undertaking, (nevada & large southern californian mileage, at no stage was i pressurized into purchasing insurances.
the vehicle came with a 1/4 tank of petrol, the assistant told me bring it back empty, that will be ok, no charge for gas,
all staff helpfull, some reviewers must go in with a attitude, you give it prepare to get it back, nothing but praise for ALL STAFF.</Review>

<Review>Reserved a midsize car but only given a choice of minivan, pickup truck or fullsize SUV when I arrived. If you are not going to have the car I reserved do not take my reservation. I had to take one of these behemoths because I would have been stuck without a car. Very bad service to boot!  Never again!<//Review>< pictures>

I rent frequently when the family car is in use. Low rates, especially if you rent through Costco Travel. Staff is friendly. They will pick you up and drop you off after you return your rental.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Because my husband had money stolen, they never gave it back. Let's go, the car went wrong. A star but I can't take it away

(Original)

Standard Panda Express, but with mall pricing. The staff were nice and quick to get the line moving. The dishes I ordered were all freshly made. It's on a quiet side of the mall. the seating is rather small, and they did have a second section that was closed off at the moment.<//text>

<Review>They were busy and when it was our turn the cashier didn't greet us and didn't offer us drinks, we had to ask for condiments 3x and when I checked our bag she never put any in. I went back to ask for hot sauce, napkins, and forks, and the cashier named Maria had the audacity to say we never asked for any. She had a bad attitude and looked like she hated her job.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The top photo shows the Panda on the 3rd floor but the address and phone number are for the Panda in the food court.

A lot of the bad reviews mention the 3rd floor, slow side, dining room. Those do not describe the panda in the food court.</text>< user_id>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>My friend went to this franchise to have a meal... The guy who was serving him acted that he was irritated and rushed him for his next order!! HE WAS RUDE! Whats up with that? Then upon paying his order here comes the latina lady at the cash register. asked if it cash or credit then so he said he will use his DEBIT card. Then, she looked at him and asked for his ID. She gave him an offensive look while looking at his ID and his DEBIT card.  After paying the bill he moved to the side so other customer can pay too. He noticed that other customer used their card but that latina lady DID NOT ASKED FOR THEIR ID CARD Several customers pay the same way but she never asked for the ID. I mean... what is that supposed to mean. I also had a bad experience with this panda express over in gendale. I ordered my food and i kind off not sure if i want two or just one entree... the lady i dont know whats her nationlity but she was very irritated and looked at me, her hand was on the counter like “hurry up”. So when i noticed her expression i just say just one entree please and thats it. When i about to pay i told the cashier that the lady service was in the bad mood. She gave her the look and i got offended because they both just smiled at each other like they dont care about what i said. Just bad service.</review>< Pics>

<time>1522966228837</time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I <3 Panda Express. If you didn't know this, Panda Express started in LA in the heart of the Glendale/Burbank/Pasadena area, which is also part of Los Angeles, and became a national chain restaurant. I always look forward to getting a fortune cookie from Panda Express, which is another reason why I keep coming back here. And, this Panda Express is right inside Glendale Galleria, so you don't have to drive another 30 minutes away, and park, and then get food.<//Review>< pictures>

What a great day at this place! Some easier holes and some challenging! Pace was just right.  Lots of privacy while playing.  Golf girl was always around :-) too! If you not on top of your game bring plenty of balls.  I can't wait to go back!<//Text>

Course layout was cool  greens in pretty good condition. The main issue for me is the fairways. Just a little water and some attention to detail and this course would be one of nicest in the inland empire. Facilities were good nice bar restaurant I mean I don’t get it. Fix the fairways.</Text>

I really enjoyed the scenic rolling hillside layout and the deer were out grazing on the 2nd hole fairway. The staff provided friendly excellent service, everyone I spoke to was very welcoming. I'll definitely be back to play here again.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dcb8bcfb2541eb:0x2694699dee462166</gmapID>< username>

Nice golf course in Corona that gives you both a canyon course on the front nine and a links course on the back nine.  Pace of play is about 4.5 to 5 hours due to some holes being cart path only.  Get in the twilight rates to catch some awesome sunset views.<//review>

What a beautiful course, wayyyyyy to nice for my game! The grounds are manicured to perfection, just an excellent place to lose 26 balls while you play with your friends... when I improve I’m going to come back and kick some butt!< /Text>

I'm a big fan of this Golf course. It went under right around March (from trying new methods of watering), but since then has seen huge improvements. Course is in good condition and green again. Greenside rough and bunkers are in good shape as well. Although there are a few patches, I never found myself in a dry spot or bad lie. Greens are even and run medium speed. Carts are comfy and include GPS and bluetooth speakers.</review>

Awesome course. Not very long. But excellent greens and well maintained. One of my favorite courses to frequent. Beautiful and scenic and the Marshall's keep the pace of the course on point.<//text>

The course is beautiful. Tough layout for sure. Definitely some blind shots. I know it sounds dorky, but i love that everytime I'm here I see deer all over the course. It's fabulous.</review>

Very poor condition. Greens are typical for a cheap muni but they charge $60.00 for a weekday round and than limit your access to the fairways. Any, shucks every golf course in the area is better in all ways. My guess is the deer will have there land back very soon.<//review>

<Review>We had a super time playing golf. The course was very well maintained, the greens especially were super nice and fast. Eagle Glen is a challenging course with lots of variation but not ridiculously difficult like PGA West. The use of the natural terrain gives the golfer many elevated tee-box and dog-leg holes, not to mention extreme beauty early in the morning. I'll be back very soon!< /Review>< user>

<Review>Not the place you want togo. Always to packed, Cause they do that purposely. Tee time At 1:50pm turned into 2:40pm didn't even finish 18, Range machine was closed cause there picker was broke, but certain people get balls. Dos is way better then here, Don't plan on a good smooth pace here.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<text>Unacceptable. This course should be closed. Complete mess all around. Hardly any real grass on the property. Condition is a 0. Rating 1 because the employees seem like nice people. Truly awful.

The course was good to play but if you wanted to drive in a cart by yourself if you had a twosome they would cost you 25.00 dollars extra. Seniors are at risk for Covid-19 and should be able to ride by themselves.</Review>

This place is in Corona therefore there’s a little driving for me.  But, with a reasonable price, this is definitely a great course.  Scenic, well maintained fairways and this could be quite challenging if you are a 20 handy.  I would love to play here again.</Review>

Beautiful location. Just attended a wedding there and the ceremony was beautiful among the grass hills. The reception was gorgeous in a medium sized room with a bar and views of the golf course. Great customer service too. Just a great experience all around.<//Text>

<Review>The front 9 is not forgiving. After the 1st hole, your up in the hills and if your not careful, bring a lot of balls( had one of our group shot a 17 on a par 3 😱)After the 10th, it’s fairly easy, and flat, with the 18th ( over water on your second shot) the most hazardous. Overall, another fun course to play< /Review><rate>4</rate>< gmapID>

I am disappointed.
Putting green is ok.
But fairway is not fair. Bad...
I'm not going again.</Text>

Nice, clean, homey  place.  Friendly employees.  Very effective locale to hold events, such as me who used it for a birthday party.  A roomy, clean and nicely decorated hall.  I would indeed recommend this place to hold their events.</review>

Recently had our wedding here (April 2019) and it was absolutely perfect! The venue is beautiful and staff is wonderful. We went venue shopping and we fell in love with this place because it’s beautiful but mostly because of the warm welcomes we had by the staff! Raul, in Sales, was VERY helpful through the process. Responded to my questions promptly, he’s friendly, professional and accommodating! Loved him. Our wedding coordinator was good. She helped everything stay on track which was great! Our wait staff and bartender — incredible! They didn’t miss a beat! Shorty (nickname), especially. We need more waiters like him! Over all, the best day!!!</Text>

The views for a wedding are amazing! The way the light hits the mountains is so stunning! I had the pleasure of photographing my clients wedding at Eagle Glen. The bridal suite is small and has not windows so I recommend staying at a hotel nearby or a Airbnb for your getting ready photos. Other than that, it’s a beautiful venue with some great spots for pictures.< /review>

I work at a nice public course in SoCal. Don’t won’t to mention it. I played here a couple weeks ago and some guy kept hitting into us. His name was Marty Enzy. He told me to call one of the assistant pros Shawn Dougin to talk about it. I have not been able to contact Shawn or the golf shop since then. It has been two weeks. The staff has been horrible to work with. I work at a course as well and this would not be happening at our place</text>

Went on a Friday to play 18 holes with my dad or fathers day weekend and there was this group of four that went so slow it took 2 hours extra and held up five groups backed up. The greens were cut badly and not consistent and the fairway was unwatered and basically dirt. When I play I make sure to be at a fast rate of play its common curtacy. Ruined my whole day and will never play there again. Dos Logos the course down the street is in great condition and is decently fast. They need a court marshall or someone to make sure people dont take 15 minutes on each green and dont ruin other peoples day. I had to cancel my plans later that day since it took 5  hours just to finish the round.</review>

One of the best courses in the Inland Empire, modern carts with GPS, bluetooth speakers, USB port to charge phone and a cooler with ice!   Course is always in good shape and the staff is excellent.  I have been golfing here for years with nothing a great experience, highly recommended!</review>

Sean Dugan has done a great job bringing Eagle Glen back to being GREAT!  Greens are in good shape, much faster than they look and roll true.  Fairways and tee boxes also in good shape.</Review>

<text>Not an adequate amount of carts. Literally waiting for carts to come in so you can go out. I don’t think they accounted for some groups all riding individually due to COVID 19 but booked more tee times then they had carts</text><Time>1599950376700< /Time>< name>

Much improved sandtraps. Not 4 star but better than most other courses in area</text>

Awesome golf course, great staff as always you get what you pay for with this place. Fairways could've been a bit more forgiving not so rock hard but figured that was from oversees.</review>

<text>We attended a wedding here in May - it's a pretty place, and a nice setting for a wedding. The room where we had the reception was your basic big room - good service for dinner. One small thing that keeps it from being a 5 is the bar area where we hung out for a few minutes before the wedding was waaaaay too loud with unruly people, and dirty - napkins on the floor, and dishes on tables. Out of place in an otherwise elegant space.</text></record></dataset><record>

This is a review for my experience today at my fav local home course at Eagle Glen GC.  As a Member, I was deeply disappointed by one of the marshal at the course.  I made a tee time for today because I have one of my VIP clients from out of town who wants to play before heading back especially after I always rave about my home course.  I book weekly mostly Fridays but my client can only play weekends so I booked today a Sunday.

As our 9:20am tee time came up, we went to the 1st tee seeing no starter out and no one was around.  As we tees off a group approached from behind asking if we’re part of the tournament.  I said no but we have a tee time I booked a week ago which I confirmed again by calling midweek and Saturday (just yesterday) when I played with my other clients I entertained.  Then in the 2nd tee, we were approached by a staff and a marshal that questioned us and were told we will have to wait for the rest of the other 8 groups to go ahead of us.  Then I asked why we were given a tee time if there was a tournament or else I would not have booked or taken my business somewhere else.

I asked if we can go to the hole in front of the tournament and skip.  And this is when I was rudely told by the Course marshal Bob why I would be playing knowing that there’s a tournament.  I replied why don’t you ask the staff why they did because I would not want to be playing behind a tournament knowing how slow the pace of play.  He implied it was my fault and shouldn’t even be out here.  As we waited if we could skip holes with my client as one of the staff called in the staff in front office Michael, the marshal Bob just abruptly told us to just follow him back in the clubhouse.

After embarrassing me in front of my clients, I decided to just treat my clients to breakfast and not golf anymore after looking forward to catching up with guests.  This is just seriously unacceptable after giving a lot of business to this club on a weekly basis.  I do hope that this gets addressed and resolved in the future so no else will ever be treated this way in front of members and their guests.</text>

We recently photographed our client's wedding here and I really want to say how nice the golf course is.  For a photographer's point of view this golf course has a nice bridge, great water fountain, nice trees for shades and hills overlooking the golf course.  The venue is spacious and not to mention amazing staffs.  Angie is the event coordinator and not only she took good care of the bride, groom and their guest but she also took good care of us vendor working at their venue. She's super nice, friendly and very easy to talk too.  Only wish that all coordinators that I meet could be like her because she has an awesome personality.   I also met Raul, he was kind to drive us around the golf course and shared his opinions for a great places to take photos.  Angie also drove us around the golf course before sunsets to capture more photos of the bride and groom.</text>

I was hoping for great things here, but it was just mediocre at best for me.  It looks like it has great potential, but this time around the course was in pretty rough shape.  Tee boxes were being re-seeded so boxes were all over the place causing really long or really short holes.  Multiple holes were cart path only which really slowed everything down. Fairways were really tight and patchy, and rough was hit or miss.  Greens rolled true, but very difficult to read as once your in the mountains it rolls downhill even though putt looks uphill.  A few beautiful scenic holes, but the rest of the layout was just meh.  Imo Glen Ivy is much better layed out and in better shape.  Perhaps in good course shape, it would be a better experience, but course right now is a bit beat up.< /review>

<Text>Golf staff were the friendliest I have encountered in a very long time. The starter was in the pro shop and took my golf clubs down stairs and put on a cart and explain see golf course layout. Never had this great service from a public course. Course has a very beautiful layout a lot of blind shots over many ravines. The green are mostly in great shape just like most courses people need to fix their pitch marks and very hard to read speed, being my first time here. Shot placement is very important on this course knowing which way the fairway landing areas is sloping makes a big difference. Only thing I didn't like all the flags are black, hard to tell where the hole is located from a distance.</Text>< Pictures>

I was recommended this place by a friend for Easter brunch. It was nothing special it was like a dining hall style. I don't think the food was really anything great or anything I want to have again. I would not recommend this place for you still brunch.< /Review>

I've DJed at this venue several times & they have always been absolutely amazing & the hospitality is through the roof. They have great food & from a vendor point of view they truly take care of their customers. If you're looking for a venue to have an event at I would STRONGLY consider Eagle Glen!</Text>

<Review>This location is so beautiful. We got married here in March and the place is super clean. The golf course is an awesome place to take pictures. The staff is incredible; everyone was super friendly and so helpful. Dennis took us around the golf course and showed us some beautiful spots for pictures and was just beyond helpful. Servers and bartenders were very friendly and again they just went above and beyond with their service. If you're looking for a fun and magical wedding, call Raul Tovar at Eagle Glen. Raul Tovar helped us all throughout our wedding planning at the venue. He said he would check up on us to see how our planning was going and help us with any questions, and he did!! We love Raul! No words can express just what a great person he is and how thankful we were to have him as our venue coordinator. We 100% recommend Raul and everyone else at Eagle Glen to help you have an amazing experience at your next event.< /Review><GmapID>0x80dcb8bcfb2541eb:0x2694699dee462166<//GmapID>< user_id>

<review>Booked on GolfNow because it was one of the few golf courses and the SoCal Place location that we were, that had a 4-star rating. But we had to drive 30 minutes to get there. I suppose I was expecting a lot more green, especially on the fairways. The greens were nice and well maintained though.

The gentleman in the Pro Shop was superb and helped us tremendously when my boyfriend discovered he had forgotten his golf shoes. His customer service skills were excellent and it's apparent that he loves his golf course and would love to see it grow.

The course itself was challenging and very fun to play. You should definitely play here if you're in the area.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dcb8bcfb2541eb:0x2694699dee462166</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Eagle Glen Golf Club rated 4-1/2 stars: Skirting the base of the Santa Ana mountains on the edge of the huge Cleveland National Forest, Eagle Glen is renowned locally as one of the most enjoyable, dramatic and best value golf courses in the greater Los Angeles area. With good maintenance, excellent bunkering and great views throughout, put Eagle Glen somewhere high on your list of "must play" courses in southern California.< /Review>

Terrible time playing course today. Started at 1 and didnt reach hole 7 til 4. The worst golf experience ive ever encountered. Marshall tells people it's backed up after the first hole but does nothing to speed up slow players! Will not be going back here due to Marshall not doing an efficient job of speeding up slow players. Especially players from the far east< /text>

Really nice golf course.  Front nine in up and down as you wind through the hills.  Back side is much flatter, but still a joy to play.  Seventeen and eighteen are great holes on the back.</text>

Beautiful golf course at a great price. The fairway is well kept and the greens are maintained well. The rough on the course tends to eat your ball, so play with caution.< /review>

Anthony makes a great spicy bloody mary! The food took so long to get to the table and when it did arrive you could tell the cook had no idea what he was doing. We ordered an opened face steak sandwich (pink), a Reuben sandwich, and a patty melt. Steak was way overdone, the patty melt was a hamburger w/ swiss cheese, bacon, and avocado on sourdough, the Ruben was a French dip on rye bread. We just ate it, it would have taken way too long to fix. And the air conditioning was out in the dining room.<//Review>

<review>Good course, plenty of contour. Greens cut too short for enjoyment. good food & service. Annoying computer-controlled carts spoiled the experience. Due diligence needed to eliminate cart-path-only holes - - about which one should be warned before booking a time.< /review>< Pics>

Liked this course.  The course is kept up and the staff is professional. The course goes through several elevation changes and is narrow is some places with lots of challenges to overcome.  But you can lose your ball easily so get out the backups if you are not hitting on par.<//Review>

Cool course, with some challenging blind greens.  Staff is really nice. Would recommend as a great week day course good weekend course, only because it can stack up.</Text>

For such a touted course this is one of the worse course that I have ever played on.  My local executive 18 hole golf course David L. Baker has more grass and is in better shape than this course.  I have been to this course three times now and every time I try and give this course a chance it seems to show why I think the course is garbage.  First time I was there there was on a December Saturday and there was no marshal or starter on course at all so there was a train of golf carts waiting to tee off the first hole.  It took me a good 35 minutes from my tee time before I could even put a tee on the ground.  By the time I was almost ready to tee off a guy in front of my group decided to bring his 5 year old son and 3 year old daughter to the course so that daddy can play golf and don't have to pay a baby sitter.  While waiting and waiting the teenager that was in our group got feed up and decided to tee off.  It apparently almost hit the little boy so the dad drove back and confronted the teenager and they almost got into a fist fight.  Again no marshal or starter anywhere in sight to regulate pace of play or to tell the stupid dad that his 5 year old son should not be teeing off from the white tees.  So I decided to leave and go play Glen Ivy instead.  Lost two hours of my time.  I have now come back to the course two different times and the course condition has gotten worse and worse.  You can tell right away that the only aspect of the course that the ground crews actually takes care of are the greens.  The fairways are a joke.  If you have not hitting off dirt than you are hitting off green painted dirt.  I could not believe that a course that is suppose to be on the higher end of the spectrum would actually paint their fairways green to try and make it look as though there is grass.  What grass there is, it is yellow at best.  So if you like hitting off green painted fairways, don't mind 6 hour rounds, but want really nice greens then come here.  But I am done with this place for good unless other people shows me proof otherwise.  My recommendation to everyone is save your time and money and go to Hidden Valley or Glen Ivy.  At least there is real grass to hit off of.</text>

Best bang for your buck in SoCal. Take it from somebody who plays everywhere. Gets a little dry in the summer but that is the only knock on this  course.</text>

You know for the price its quite a value, if you have someone that has the members deal, $25 weekday, $3 beers (at the bar/restaurant) and good beers too! Nice apread out course, with a few challenges.<//Review>

Great design, needs  a little TLC; however 2hours to play 6 holes- not good at any price. Will not be back, sorry.< /text>

The price for buying anything is WAY too expensive. The golf course is to small for any group over six to gather. DON'T GO THERE!!! IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!!<//review>

{'time': 1510675717590, 'text': 'We actually have all of our Merchandise priced cheaper than any golf shop in the IE.  We priced matched to any non-green grass facility which is unheard of for a golf course to be the same as box store. The grille handles up 100 people in the restaurant at a time.

(Translated by Google) It's a big and spacious golf course with a clean inside. The green rolls well and the fairway doesn't have grass. I hope it gets better quickly ㆍIt's great because the green rolls well ㆍ😍

(Translated by Google) The scenery was nice and it was fun!
One flaw is that our couple
18 holes car path only!!!
Because you follow the autograph
It was really hard...
Because it’s the day after the rain???
Still, I want to go and hit it again..

(Original)
경치가 좋고 재미 있었네요!
한가지 흠이라면 우리 부부가
18홀을 car path only!!!
사인을 따르면서 치니까
정말로 힘들었네요...
비가온 다음날이라서???
그래도 다시한번 가서 치고 싶네요..<//Review>

It was a little non-course and was generally good.
