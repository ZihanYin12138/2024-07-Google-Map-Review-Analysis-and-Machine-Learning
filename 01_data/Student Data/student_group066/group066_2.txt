<Text>Working with Boat Country and Colton Smith was a dream experience.  Their ease to work with and patience with our our questions were top caliber.  The communication throughout the process was perfect.  Boat arrived on time exactly as ordered.  Thanks Boat Country for our newest family addition.  Can’t wait to see the new Antioch location as it progresses!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>I recently purchased my Master Craft XT23 from boat Country in Ripon, Ca. From the beginning to the end was a pleasure. My salesman was very knowledgeable and answered all questions that I had. He even drove an hour to where I live and took me out for a few hours and showed me details on the boats operating systems. I would highly recommend Boat Country if you’re in the market for a boat. Their customer service is amazing and they are super knowledgeable about everything they sell!< /Review>< Name>

Boat Country and Jack were amazing to work with. Jack knew everything about each boat we walked through, and helped us make the right choice for our needs. The boat was ready to go when I showed up, and the paperwork took less than 5 minutes. I was very satisfied with the professionalism and zero pressure browsing, and I wouldn’t but my next boat from anywhere else.< /Text>

Boat country is brand new and they have everything you need I sound like a salesman I like everything about boat country except the prices but if you need it they got it and the staff is friendly even if I can't afford it I have had my motor fixed there and I have bought some fittings for my engine and my gas tank so I appreciate them specially for fixing my engine<//Review>

Colton and Jack were knowledgeable and helpful about each step of the boat buying process. They went through every aspect of our new boat explaining in detail each feature. They answered all of our questions with ease. Would recommend anyone looking to purchase a boat to check them out!</text>

I purchased my boat from Boat Country in their new location in Ripon.  I had the pleasure of working with Colton Smith who was very professional and super knowledgeable regarding the line ups they have, fishing in general and helped me pick the perfect boat for me and my family.  The service was amazing and I was kept up to date every step of the way.  Don't hesitate to go into Boat Country if you are checking out boats and ask for Colton for a great experience.</text>

We had such an amazing experience at Boat Country. Colton and Jack and all the staff were fantastic and so knowledgeable. We were able to leave the same day with our new boat. Even the financing was seamless. I highly recommend Boat County if you are looking for a boat. They will take care of you no question about it. Thanks so much. We can’t wait to use our new boat!< /review>

Just picked up my first boat from Boat Country. I worked with the sales manager, Colton Smith, and had a great experience! Very professional staff and very clean new facility. I had the opportunity in chatting with the owner, Brent, as well. Very nice guy. Great deals, great service.<//text>

I wouldn't  buy a boat from them. I would buy all my boats from them. Great service, helpful staff, super clear modern showroom. Best boat shop around. Only question  is when should I upgrade? Those 2020 SEs got my name written all over them.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>We just bought our first boat from Boat Country a 2019 North River.

I don't normally bother with writing anything on Yelp but I wanted to take the time to actually put something on here. Colton Smith was the sales team member helping us through the process and he was AMAZING. Colton spent time on our first visit to boat country to walk us through all the types of North River boats and really nail down what it was we were looking for (because we weren't really sure!). He also went through and explained and got us pictures or showed us on other boats (at the store) all the options that we could do with our North River boat. He even talked to North River so that I could get the North River Logo sticker I liked the best on the boat (which I wasn't sure if that was going to be possible).

He kept in touch with us during the build process, sending us weekly email updates and photos from the factory. When it came time to pick up our boat he even pulled some strings and worked extra hours with some of his co-workers to get the boat ready for pick up just before a big holiday weekend.

Since we've had the boat for a while, he has also kept in touch. Assisted with scheduling our first routine maintenance and on his off time helped us straighten out the settings on our GSP system.

I loved my experience here, all of the staff I had interactions with were amazing. Colton was the best! I would highly recommend making a boat purchase here if you are considering it.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>If you are looking at boats, Do yourself a favor and look at Moomba before your go spend your life savings on another boat. The owner Brent is a great guy and will spend a ton of time with you discussing boats and options. We have had every brand boat made and this Moomba Craz is the by far the best one I have owned.< /Text>< pictures>

Boat country is the place to go in Stanislaus, San Joaquin Valley for both service and sales for boats. I’ve had my boat serviced there 3 times and they are always friendly and have never missed a deadline on service completion. I purchased my North River from BC two years ago and it was a great experience. Upfront pricing and a commitment to customer service. Great selection of “boat toys” as well.< /review>

This dealership treats the customer well—not overly pushy but extremely helpful. From my first contact with them, I waited more than a year before finally pulling the trigger and making a decision. Part of the problem was the size of my shop and deciding what I could actually fit inside—they measured different boats on trailers to help me decide. They were patient with me, and of course were happy when I moved forward. The new showroom is clean, spacious, and beautiful.

Just bought a new Hewes 190 Sea Runner from Boat Country. I couldn’t be happier with the entire experience. The owner, Brent, was patient and responsive to all my questions. Very knowledgeable about the product he sells and his team at Boat Country got me on the water in a weeks time. Brent worked with me on how I wanted the boat set up and the custom features on the boat and trailer make it well worth a trip to Ripon.<//text>

<text>Very helpful staff.  Had the parts I needed in stock.  As a new boater they were very patient with all my questions.  The place is big and they have a nice inventory of boats, boards, and everything else.  The Supras and Moombas in stock are beauties to look at as well!<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1533926060932, 'text': "TJ, thanks for all the positive feedback.

<Time>1559010553645</Time><rating>5< /rating><review>We have been boating for over 20 years and recently decided to upgrade. We initially checked out the Moomba’s at Boat Country. Colton and the team there have a no pressure sales style coupled with great service and knowledge of their products. We actually shopped boat dealerships between Ripon and Sacramento and everywhere between. We ended our hunt back at Boat Country where we got the best price, service and value. I highly recommend Boat Country to anyone looking for the best. We are very happy with them and our new boat.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I've done a lot of boat comparisons and scouring the internet for my first boat purchase. I landed on the Boat Country site which caught my eye on a used 2011 Moomba Mobious LSV model. The asking price was a bit over my budget, so from the site I requested a quote with hopes to negotiate. I received an email from Colton Smith acknowledging my inquiry shortly after with additional information regarding the condition of the boat explaining the rigorous inspections spent ensuring that everything is functional and ready for the buyers.

That was a great assurance, but my hopes were to determine if there were any possibilities to negotiate the asking price to satisfy my budget. I explained to Colton my financial position and where I wanted to be on my financial commitment for a purchase. Colton consulted his boss on my financial ask and requested to fill out a credit application. The next morning Colton informed me of the approval and was able to meet my budget requirements allowing me to make the purchase.

I have to say that this experience on purchasing my first boat was probably the best interaction I've had and this not even stepping a foot in the dealership.  I arrived at Boat Country a couple days later and the team at Boat Country immediately greeted me. The friendliness I received from Colton and preparation demonstrated from him as if I had a designated consultant that helped me feel I had made a great investment decision and chosen the right dealership. Colton walked me through the boat and had all the paperwork from finance ready for review for signing. I was literally an official boat owner in 20 minutes and spent more time just perusing through the floor merchandise to get me started in the water and I left the dealership fully satisfied with no regrets. It’s not often you interact with dealers and receive a no pressure experience like what you would get in a car’s dealership getting the right deal that doesn’t impact your financials at the end.

I'm not much of a review writer, but I felt I needed to get my experience told and if any of my friends and family considers picking up a boat, I would not hesitate to refer them to Boat Country just for the customer experience they provide which they clearly demonstrated and their efforts on preparation.

I want to extend my appreciation to Colton on providing me a smooth transaction and meeting my financial commitment.

Thank You Colton and team for the pleasant purchasing experience....<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Our experience with Boat Country in Ripon was second to none.  We have visited stores and worked with staff from stores representing Nautique, Centurion, Mastercraft, and Malibu and where treated ok at most of the dealerships.  However,  Brent and his team were the most knowledgeable and professional of them all.  In the end, we loved the Supra boat, but more importantly we trust they will take the best care of us throughout the boat ownership.  We feel confident we made the right choice doing business with Brent and Boat Country.< /Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Nice bar for my first time. Just visited to celebrate my friends birthday. It was karaoke night so I did my first karaoke singing. The Malibu Pineapple drink was too sweet just tasted pineapple more than Malibu. And plus the cup was over filled. Anyhow cool spot no cover charge. And plus I liked that there was tvs to watch the baseball game.<//review>

<Review>Bartenders are friendly and attentive. Usually a good crowd is in the bar. Food truck outside is usually available for Mexican meals. A very comfortable "tavern" style atmosphere. Karaoke after 9 pm Thu, Fri, and Sat.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Little hole in the wall bar.  Not sure why it is listed as a lounge.  My niece and I went in for a quick beer.  The lady behind the bar was super sweet.  They have karaoke on Friday's and Saturday's.  It was very laid back.< /text>

<Text>Well it might be too early to judge, my first time was last night but this bar is slowly becoming my favorite. Cheaper and stronger drinks, people are really relax and the bar tenders are relax. Everything here is great!

<rate>2</rate><review>This used to be my favorite place to go and that has changed over the span of a few months. On frequent occasions, 2 of the bartenders have been unnecessarily mean and nasty towards me. One of them has called me profane names based on personal opinions of me and another has teased and mocked me for no clear reason. Upon requesting a shot, one of the bartenders thought it was entertaining to mock me and belittle me. She then poured a few drops into a shot glass and said, “Here, that’s what you get.” And came back saying in a very rude tone of voice, “You gonna drink that?” I felt bullied and disgusted with her behavior and attitude. Both her and the other bartender also think they can drink on the job and then attack everyone else verbally or bully them by withholding alcohol based on biased opinions. I go out to have drinks and unwind, not to be abused. Never going here again.< /review>< pics>

I like "hole in the wall" bars.  This is just that.  Not sure why I like it, but I go more often than I'd like to admit.  Oh, they cook something for their guests every Friday.<//Review>

Legit Mexican food at a reasonable price. Anything with Super in the title gets you crema, guacamole and salsa in addition to cheese beans and rice. Smash some delicious 😋 Mexican classics here.</Review>

Go here so you can learn things you didnt know you didn't know, like lacquer vs polyurethane guitars and why lacquer is better.

The classical guitar George recommended, a La Patrie is seriously amazing and I couldn't be happier with how it feels, sounds and plays. Never going anywhere else for my music needs.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

THE best music store I've been to... and I have been to them all! Professional musicians that I have worked with LOVE to shop here. A lot of that is because of GEORGE. He is the best! Support your local businesses! Especially if they are as solid as Kaye's. I only post a review if a place is impressive.. or a giant disappointment. KAYE'S is IMPRESSIVE.</Text>

<Date>1597703384937< /Date><Rate>5</Rate><text>The man that owns this store (I apologize for forgetting his name) is very friendly and knowledgeable... which is no surprise considering he's been a local establishment in the valley for 50 years. I purchased a violin from him a few days ago and he was kind enough to tune it as well as put placement stickers to make it easier to adjust your fingers properly. Unfortunately I want to exchange the violin and I'm leaning towards a guitar, and I have no doubt that he will lead me in the right direction for the most suitable guitar. The violin is beautiful but I just didn't have that connection, if that makes sense, when I went to play it.
I definitely recommend coming here for your musical instrument needs.

<review>I could not even dream of taking my guitar anywhere else.

My guitar teacher has been teaching me many things beyond playing. One of the things he’s taught me is to understand the quality and workmanship of a finally tuned instrument in the amount of skill that goes into it. He referred me here to get my guitar repaired before I could even start lessons.

I understand this is done To teach me that performing in art requires the best tools. And that means coming to one of the best places we’re not only do you get someone who understands literally every specific guitar, ukulele, and every other string instrument you could dream of,

But also the patience and diligence to teach arts and create another artist… I still feel like I underpaid LOL

I got my guitar repaired here, put new strings, and it was adjusted so amazingly well that even though it was essentially a more affordable design of guitar it seem to play like one that cost much more… It sounds incredible and I am so super grateful<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Walked in just to look at Kanileas, walked out with a U-Bass uke. The unique Geoge-selected inventory is spot on. Expect to buy when you go in, because you'll see something! Impressive grouping of ukuleles of all grades.</review>

George and Braye are friendly, approachable and outwardly knowledgeable.
Prices seem reasonable.
Parking lot is hectic so park in the back.

Overall good experience buying a Roland keyboard.</text>

Kaye's Music Scene is my favorite music store. George carries quality products, knows his products inside and out, cuts great deals, and follows through with extra customer service. I have bought several instruments here, and intend to by several more. Kaye's Rocks!</text>

George Kaye owns and manages this full service music store.  You will mainly see keyboards, amplifiers and ukeleles when you first walk in.  Drums and guitars are further back. Lessons are available for all instruments.  He is the nicest, kindest man who knows his stuff.
He will open the store for you and help you out during these difficult times.<//Text>

My only complaint is that it took me so long to discover this shop!  George’s Google listing doesn’t indicate that, although he does have a good selection of keyboards, he also has a huge inventory of guitars, ukuleles, drums, etc.  He admits that’s been a problem, but he didn’t have a say in the listing.  Let it be known that he has a great guitar shop!

George is knowledgeable, friendly, patient and very helpful.  My advice is to always listen to his advice.  His priority is customer satisfaction, and his recommendations always turn out to be the best choice.  I was too budget-conscious in choosing an acoustic guitar, but he very kindly allowed me to return it for a better one when I realized he was right about the sound I was looking for.  The best guitar shop I’ve ever found!< /review>

I've been visiting this retail plaza for as long as I can remember, but yesterday was the first time I set foot in this place.  I asked, do you have ukeleles? The store owner George was there amusingly turned my gaze to his wall literally covered with ukeleles.  I bought one and also a session partly because he was so charming and helpful.  He also taught me how to pronounce ukelele with an oo-kelele instead of you-kelele.<//text>

I walked in, waited about 5-10 minutes, because the guy was on the telephone talking.
I finally asked what I was looking for, but he couldn't help me.
Guitar Center in Northridge was much more helpful. Besides, if I would have bought what I was looking for, that dude probably would have charged me more than Guitar Center in Northridge did.<//Review>

<Text>It was  bad I entered a place stood there for like 5 minutes the guy saw me couple of times he was with another man explaining something about ukuleles he didn't even said I'll be there in a minute or something like that I don't know maybe he needs to put a sign up saying white  people only. I went there because I needed a cable for my guitar at the end I went to the same place you're never wrong at Sam Ash</Text>< pics>

<Text>George has been around for years and will continue to do so.  He is very knowledgeable and is more than helpful with choosing the right instrument.  Personalized service you can’t get at the larger stores.  Have bought 2 guitars from him.  Prices are competitive with Guitar Center and on-line stores.  No reason to go anywhere else.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2996778512f05:0xa28d9f91728963fa<//gmapID></record>

As a budding musician and father of kids who are learning, Kaye's really is the place for us. The reviews got me in the door, but the staff lived up to the expectations. Very knowledgeable, very patient, really welcoming.

Daughter and I play ukulele, and I have never seen a larger assortment of ukes available. It was an awesome display and the proprietor was able to explain the difference between all of them, teaching us what to look for in quality and workmanship.

Pianos abound, and while there aren't the shelves of sheet music from every popular band, they focus on lesson books. That is because they have a great music school there with a bulletin board to keep track of the students and the instructors. We got a spot for my son to take piano lessons, and met a couple of the instructors. I am even going to sign up for lessons with a teacher willing to put a combo ukulele/piano program together for me.

The one-on-one touch that this place offers is exactly what we were looking for, compared to the kids working in the "big box stores" that you might traditionally go for your Guitar needs. ;)< /review>

I've been a devoted customer since 1970.  As a professional musician, you cannot ask for more than George or his staff can offer.  They know their product lines and assist you in making the best and most appropriate purchase for your musical needs.  One of the last real music stores in existence.

Pay them a visit and you'll be glad you did.

A rare gem these days, a local family owned and operated music store! George is incredibly knowledgeable about his entire stock and will go out of his way to find answers for you. I would go here before Guitar Center or Sam Ash anyday, even if the prices were higher, which they are definitely not. In fact I feel like the prices at Kaye's are more reasonable than many of the bigger corporate stores that offer no knowledge either. The music teachers in the store are wonderful as well. All of the teachers have at least bachelors degrees in music, and many have masters or are working on PhDs. Really a rare find!</review>

I live right around the corner form Kaye's Music Scene, and have walked by the shop plenty of times.  So when it was time for some new guitar strings for my son's guitar and a few picks I stopped in for the first time.  Being a cheap skate that I am I normally find my purchases on line, and look for the best deals.  But since it was a small purchase I figured what the heck.

Once I walks in I met George the owner.  He is a very nice, and knowledgeable guy.  We started talking about guitars and the next thing I know I'm buying a $500 guitar.  I got a good vibe from the guy, he told me how competitive his prices were etc.  Of course I figured it was just sales man talk but as I said I got a good vibe from George and decided to throw caution to  the wind and buy the guitar.

When I got home I decided to to see how much more extra money I spent on my new guitar and was pleasantly surprised to fine not only did I not spend lots of extra money but got it for cheaper then I could find on the internet.  Seriously, no lie.  I got my Yamaha guitar cheaper from Kaye's Music Scene then I could of off the internet.  Go figure.

In the days of big chains stores, the internet, etc., I'm afraid the small local guys are fast becoming a thing of the past.  But Kaye's Music Scene has been in the same location and owned and operated by the same family for over 47 years.  With the level of service, knowledge, variety of instruments, and the fantastic prices they provide, I'm hoping George and Kaye's Music Scene are here for another 47 years.

Thanks again George for all the information and the great deal on my Yamaha guitar.  I'll be back.< /text>

Sometimes when I get a haircut here it’s pretty good. Other times it comes out terrible. I asked for a quarter of an inch on top and the lady cut off like an inch and a half! The lady also cut my side burns uneven and pushed my hairline back when I didn’t even ask for it. I don’t want to play Russian Roulette with my hair each time I come here. Prepare yourself, the cut may come out good or bad.< /text>

<Text>Do NOT come here for your haircut!!! Should have left when the first stylist kept stalling,  because he didn’t want to cut my hair. He kept going to the bathroom until the second stylist finished the client she had and finally said it was my turn. When I said I would like my hair texturized with a razor, she replied that she didn’t have a razor and pointed to her very basic tool set. I have never known a stylist not to have a razor as part of their styling arsenal. This is when I should have ran out the door! But, I stayed...thinking it would be ok, because the stylist was nice.  She just wasn’t very good.  One inch became 3-4 inches and my hair is uneven in a few spots.  There’s a Fantastic Sam’s on Imperial and that’s where I should have gone. They had far better reviews and hopefully aren’t discriminatory.<//Text><rating>1</rating><GmapID>0x80dcd6a80900c19f:0xc193883ec5e4d030< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Came 8 minutes before closing and they turned me away. Their website says that anyone who comes in before closing will be served. Employees were rude.</review>

Place is never busy when I go.  However, each time I've gone, I've had to go back to get mistakes corrected.  They allow you 7 days to get the correction.< /Text>

Very delicious and great quality drinks! The 50% sweetness is great, but might still be on the sweet end. Highly recommend this place if you are in the area< /Text>

<Text>This tea spot has the most creative, delicious, and beautiful boba drinks in the area. Their extensive menu of options is amazing and you can also customize/build your own so the possibilities are infinite. I'm pregnant so having lots of yummy caffeine free options and alternatives is awesome. It's our favorite for sure, and the staff is always so kind and welcoming. I give them a thousand stars!</Text>< Pics>

One must wonder why Monrovia's quaint village center boasts not one but three tea houses. While it may seem overkill for such a small but thriving downtown business district, I tip my hat to Cup of Cha. The have an expansive selection of tea and coffee-based drinks and friendly knowledgeable staff. Overall you will get better tasting brews - no doubt a result of their effort to steer away from syrups and powders whenever possible, opting for a more authentic experience. I will be back.< /text>

<Review>Suggestion for the staff for a pre-ordered/prepaid drink. The whole point of pre-ordering/prepaying is to avoid lines. However, I was told by the staff to get in line and wait until I was at the register. Even though they have a designated pickup area to gather your drink. Inefficient and I'm sure that lots of patrons would just love to grab and go. I hope this process is changed to align what most people would say is the point of pre-ordering/prepaying. Otherwise I love the drinks here, they have been consistently great!< /Review><Rating>3<//Rating><gmapID>0x80c2d9f5005dce1b:0xfc4f4fe86ff6bb8< /gmapID><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

I stumbled upon this hidden boba gem while strolling the street. Cup Of Cha Tea House is a cute little organic tea house on Myrtle avenue in Monrovia. It’s atmosphere was very cool, relaxing and bright. Interior design was modern looking yet unpretentious. They have assorted variety of organic drinks from milk teas to fruit teas to slushes to iced coffee. Staff was ebullient to take my order. I ordered their Summer Fling, a slush made of guava, peach and mango jelly, just because it fits my flirtatious personality. Okay I’m neither here or there. Back to the review. It’s fruity flavor perfectly fits its bestowed slush name. Prices were very reasonable. Overall, I enjoyed my order experience and drink. I highly recommend this tea house and I shall return. Believe me!<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Ellie was really polite and had amazing customer service, she will always make sure your order is perfect and catered to you liking. 10 out of 10 would recommend. They have the perfect tapioca pearls that are sweet and chewy. Their workers are extremely polite and will cater to your needs perfectly. I recommend their fruit teas, they’re not over sweetened and are just perfect. Definitely my go to boba place for life.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>One of my favorites boba places in the area. Great tea, boba, and pudding. I like it 25% sweet.

Everyone wears a mask and there's a plastic divider between you and the cashier - no messing around here!< /Review>< pictures>

Customer service was awesome!  I like that they serve organic green tea.  I got the lychee green tea with mango star jelly at 25% sugar, and it was good.  Very refreshing.  It had bits of actual lychee fruit in it, which I really enjoyed.<//Text>

<text>This place is so cute! I came in for a drink and a place to work, and it turned out to be the perfect spot. Very clean and spacious, and the women working were SO friendly. I came in during a rush, but they were very quick and efficient—they even apologized for the wait, though it was hardly any wait at all. I ordered the Lavender milk tea with honey boba, and it was delicious. Highly recommend House of Cha to anyone looking for a great space, great customer service, and a delicious drink!< /text><user>112631471434057327118</user><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_name>

Happened to pass by during the soft opening, and I try every tea house I come across. I tried the Malibu Sun (both slush and tea) and both versions were great! Staff was very friendly and the space is very open with lots of places to sit and relax.< /review>

<Text>Good! This was my first time visiting this place and I would come back bedt time in the area. You can ask for samples of the different teas they have if they haven't offered you already! I ordered the green tea taro milk tea  and the regular milk tea with lychee jelly and boba. The boba is nice and fresh,  you can tell they make fresh batches often. I also like that you can customize the sweetness and that's super nice<//Text>< Pics>

<gmapID>0x80c2d9f5005dce1b:0xfc4f4fe86ff6bb8< /gmapID><text>If your a fan of boba drinks you should definitely give this place a shot! I've already been here way too many times since they opened, it's honestly kind of sad.

So far we've tried their classic milk tea, brown sugar milk drink, and a few of their fruit teas and all of them were amazing. You can actually taste the tea in their tea drinks unlike other places where it tastes mostly like sugar/syrup. We do get the tea drinks half sweet but that's mostly a matter of preference. The brown sugar milk drink (I don't know any of the actual drink names) is especially good. The milk they use tastes like the expensive Strauss milk from Sprouts and goes really well with the brown sugar syrup and boba. The boba is nice and chewy and not overcooked, the pudding is pretty standard but good, and the agar boba I'm actually quite a fan of though I know some people don't care for the texture.

Overall this is an amazing boba spot, and I really hope people give it a chance because I think this is their only location and it's just as good as (if not better) than some of the other (also very good) boba chains nearby.< /text>< Response>

< Review>
After 17 years of renting the same apartment and never once asking for any kind of upgrades, now that this tenant is moving out you provide a breakdown of costs that will cost a disabled person his entire deposit.  Very sad.  The average length of stay is nowhere near that length of time.  River Oaks has more than made their money.<//Review>

<Review>My review of the complex would be excellent in all areas if it didn’t include the manager. The ladies in the office and maintenance are amazing and efficient. They address any issues quickly. They are friendly. The only person I have had any conflict with was the manager. She stole $315.00 from my deposit which makes me not want to remain in the complex, but when she’s not around and making rules that inconvenience the residents I enjoy staying here even though the rent goes up every year. I would recommend this complex to someone that just needed a place and there was no openings anywhere else. There are always openings here because no one stays for very long. There is also no visitor parking in the complex. Many residents park on the street as well because the manager thought it would help with the parking problems if she charged the residents to park in the complex. Originally your parking spot came with your apartment and there was a visitor parking spot in each section. So the main improvement would be to have visitor parking in the complex. Also the entrance street is not wide enough for people to drive both ways and have people park on the side.< /Review>< name>

River Oaks is a great place to live!! The office staff   is super friendly and professional !! Megan provides excellent customer service. You can count on her if you needed work to be done on your place or just to ask a simple question If you need something fixed in your townhouse the maintenance crew will fulfill the work order the same day. Jerry from maintenance goes the extra mile to provide excellent maintenance repair. The whole maintenance staff is super friendly as well. Oh one more thing it is nice quiet.<//Review>

<text>The office and maintenance staff are great and personable. An experience that stands out is that last summer my a/c went out and I have a little one, they made us feel like we were a priority and gave us a temporary a/c to help until the new parts came in for it. Any maintenance or office related thing you need you got to ask and they are more then happy to help.< /text>< Resp>

<review>I got laid off during covid 19 and the staff did not want to help with rent at all and still threatened to evict. Also, everyone else has a fan in their dining room but us and they don’t put lights in the master bedroom and not all the outlets work!

I have lived at River Oaks for almost 5 years and have enjoyed it the whole time. Any maintenance concerns are taken care of right away and correctly the first time. The office staff is professional and friendly. As I say in each review I make my one complaint is the addition of an extra charge for parking within the complex that was put into effect a couple years ago.<//review>

I needed my room door shaved at the bottom and my showerhead decided to malfunction and give my bathroom a shower instead.!   Cruz and Jerry came over mid morning and fixed both with a minimum of hassle.  They were very professional and friendly--- they need a raise at some point👍!</Text>< Pictures>

So far we love it here- only have a few issues. People dumpster dive in our dumpsters in the middle of the night and it wakes us up- and the gates are supposed to be closed at night. It does make me feel a little unsafe. However, we love our townhouse. The staff here is the best- office and maintenance. Friendly and try their best to help in any way.</Text>

These apartments are expensive and not worth the rent . When my family and I moved in there were many things that needed to be fixed. The apartments and appliances are outdated. The cabinets and shelves were broken in different places, doors wouldn’t stay closed correctly.  None of it was fixed even when office staff walked the apartment and saw all the same things we did. I’ve rented cheaper apartments in better conditions.<//text>

Poor management mess up in our information forms, gave me the wrong set of keys to my mail box and apartment. 2 months in advance before moving in request for a two car spots ..only gave me 1(waiting list for car spots won’t tell you until you move in)  apartment townhouse are very dated no light fixtures in the master bedroom and living room , old electrical and flooring boards in the upstairs bathroom make so much noise.   Poor maintenance..Stairs Hand rails fell off 3 times (use wrong screws) laundry room bifold doors fell off the first week I moved in still haven’t fixed it (5 months from now ... nothing) too much wall patches.. old appliance and countertops for the price you are paying.. not worth living here<//Text>

<review>I have lived at River Oaks for five years and enjoyed it. Maintence is performed quickly, it is quiet and the atmosphere is friendly both management and staff as well as the residents. I have seen none of the events others have complaned about in all the time I have lived here.</review>< name>

I lived there in 2008 and the price at the time was affordable but now i think its alittle expensive. The good thing about river oaks apartments is that they have gates to go in and out so safety is a plus. They also have a pool, basketball court for the kids and if you want to lose alittle of that holiday fat lol well the have a gym there so you can work on the new years resolution. Also river oaks is located on 11th and fargo in Hanford which is the norh side of town which is a great area to live in.  There's a mini shopping center next to the apartments. So if that sounds tempting for you and your family tjen i would recommend renting here. Hope is hrlps you and good luck.< /Text>

Subpar at best, it is affordable however it's not a place I want to live much longer. First the apartments they show you are not the apartment you will be getting. We live in a two story townhome and it looks like it's stuck in the 1990s. Kitchen has crappy appliances have had to have dishwasher and fridge replaced. Cabinets are poorly designed and assembled . Fireplace is outdated and more of an eyesore. A/C and thermostat are always on the frits and when we report these things the staff has an attitude and the job is done half hearltly. We still have an open job from a year ago as well as when we move in. Community area are not great either basketball hoop is always broken. They don't give you a pool key when you move in. Lastly parking there is zero visitor parking available. People are always parking in firelane or illegally. All in all this place is not worth the money, also everything is an up charge 5 dollars for parking, 15 for cover n 50 for a garage kind of redic. We can't wait for our lease to be up to move out<//Review>

<username>Yvonne Barraza Valenzuela</username><review>if you want a direct bus to tijuana airport, call this business.  i originally booked with greyhound but i would rather take it as a $200 loss than miss a bus and be stranded. with greyhound,  I would of had to transfer buses 2 times and with these guys it's direct. they will leave me at the airport and pick me up at the airport. Rd trip: $142 alot cheaper than greyhound as well.< /review><Rate>1<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

They closed center St station on March 18th, and now we have 421 Weber location. The problem is they dropped my mother on the sidewalk, in the dark, no where to sit, she's disabled, and came to visit me from Fresno. Not right, they should have a place to sit while you wait on your ride to come. Sign that says old building has closed and moved was flapping in the wind and just by chance I was able to see that they moved to Weber and California. Stockton has to do better, truly sad.< /review>

Had to come to Stockton to do a few things. Its nice.  Bus depot is great. Staff is nice and awesome bathrooms are clean.  Bad part nothing is around the area. Like one subway. That's about it. You have to go 3-4 blocks to get a coffee.  But most if the buses for Stockton are at the depot.

The rtd 150 takes you to dublin Pleasanton Bart station.

Greyhound station is nice. Good seats helpful people.

Just remember to bring some change. Bring some cash. Like $1 and fives.  And have your cell phone charged. With a few back up batteries.

Also again nothing really around outside the depot.  So either call a lyft. Uber. Or a cab.

Bus pass is $4. $2 for senior disabled for rtd.< /Review>

Bus was over an hour late in Stockton, the Greyhound station on Richards Blvd is fairly new. On site security and is across the street from a police station. Very safe.<//review>

Riding Greyhound was much nicer and less stressful than I had thought it would have been. I recommend using Greyhound if you don't need to use a private car.< /text>

<Review>My son's booked tickets to Los Angeles from Stockton . They have everything booked for Disneyland tomorrow. They bought tickets online and showed up to the terminal . 5 other passengers Sat with them waiting for the same bus but no one at Greyhound told anyone that the bus don't load at the terminal. It also says the address is the same so all of these passengers missed the same bus. My son's get to miss out on over half a day at Disneyland. Sooo wrong. What I don't understand is the driver must have had some idea of how many passengers bought tickets and should be boarding his bus in Stockton and when they didn't board wonder where they were but none of these other passengers were told they should get on the bus somewhere other than the terminal. I am so going to put a complaint at the better businesses bureau.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><rate>1</rate><user_id>103815530023276303370<//user_id></record>

<Review>The black guy with a beard is so rude. He has a nasty personality. Any question you ask he will have a snide smart ass response. He won't help you with simple things that most other agents will do without question or attitude. I use greyhound a lot between Stockton/Reno. I hate walking in and seeing him standing behind the counter. I know it's about to be a horrible customer service experience. He should not be in customer service or in any capacity where he has to work with the public.</Review>< user_name>

Firstly, the buses are never on time. Second, the people who take this greyhound are sketchy and probably all on drugs. But the worse part is the staff. From the bus drivers to the people who work inside. They are all terrible and rude. I don't know if they just aren't used to having normal people.

One time the bus left a hour before the next a hour after.
Out side the terminal is really bad with drug sales everywhere and no security.

The sign outside says it will soon be a mall hopefully sooner the better<//Review>

My father was supposed to go for an interview in LA on may 3 and the bus was supposed to leave at 12:05am from stockton CA but the bus never showed up at the terminal . We waited until 1:00am and we had the tracker also ,we saw the bus drove by the stockton terminal but never picked up passangers, there were six other cars waiting. There was no one at the bus terminal and  We called there customer service to file a complaint and they had no clue whats going on. They tried to convince me that bus stopped in Stockton to pickup passangers. They did not even refund our money and its not like we were traveling with greyhound for the first time. We are regular customers with them and always board the bus from the same terminal in stockton. Really bad on their part!</Text>

<Review>This particular location is gross... if you don't mind pulling into a place that could be mistaken for being in a zombie apocalypse movie and smells like urine then this is the place to stop...

My mom had the absolute worst experience with this company... one incident was the bus driver ditching the passengers to buy a ticket to leave town on a different bus!!! The local news came to interview the stranded passengers... they couldn't believe what they were hearing!!

Another was one of the bus drivers was so rude and disrespectful to the passengers and whe  my mom stood up and politely told her "hey there's no need to be like that" she told my mom she was going to kick her off the bus and that she was going to have the pokice waiting at the next stop for her!! My mom ended up having to call the police because a man was exposing himself to a female passenger... and when the bus driver was alerted? Well... she just couldn't be bothered!! When my mother asked the driver for their location in order to give it to the police she completely ignored my mother!!

OH and let's not forget the bus breaking down in the middle of a snowy highway!

It took my mom 6 days to get from North Dakota to California... she was suppose to be home in time for my bridal shower... she was not!

For my mom to spend months at Standing Rock helping the injured and sick, away from her family and then to be treated like garbage the whole way home is appalling!! And she only came home to be at my wedding! She has every intention of returning... Grayhound will NEVER have our business ever again!</Review>< Pictures>

It's the middle of summer and only one portable fan for the whole building? C'mon, it's 2013 and air conditioning has been long since invented.< /review>

when they did open lady was very helpful when I purchased my ticket in Medford Oregon to Turlock California the Greyhound bus driver was late getting there on time and it put me in Sacramento late so I could not get the bus to go to Turlock California so I had to take another bus that only went to Stockton so I felt I was ripped off on some money</review>

<text>Greyhound sold me a ticket from Stockton Ca to Los Angeles but the bus never came. I've been waiting since 1130pm and was suppost to leave at midnight. I called bus tracker and they said it stopped at 1232am but that was a lie. There's other people waiting on the same bus #1439. 😞 Frustrated!!</text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Malo spent 2 hours waiting for the truck and says that the driver had been driving for too many hours and that he is stuck in the sacrament and they have not been able to grab another, they do not have control of their drivers.

< Review>
Went to Titupathi Bhimas for lunch.  They had lot of options for South Indian food.  We ordered Rasam, mesh Vada, plain idli, Mysore masala dosa and onion chili uttapam.  Only thing we didn’t like was Mysore masala but overall food was good and appropriate measures were taken for Covid.< /Review>

The owner/manager keeps on talking loudly to people on the phone in his language. Which we don’t mind but the fact that some of his guests are sitting there is extremely rude.

He should know better.

To top things off, he walked in with his half eaten plate into the kitchen and filled it up in front of all guests.<//review>

Ordered Chilli Paneer, Molagapodi Idly, Mango Lassi and Sweet of the day, through Uber Eats.

Big red pieces of crunchy crispy paneer was a good appetizer. Not overly saucy and tastes good without any other sauce or chutney.

Molagapodi Idly was spicy and provided with a coconut chutney. The menu mentions sambar, but our order missed it. Anyways idly was tasty and enough for two, especially if ordering an appetizer.

Mango Lassi was yummy and helped us cool the spice from the idly. The surprise sweet of the day was daal kheer and it was sooo good.<//text>

One of the best South Indian food in the bay area. MIK Madurai idly kadai is my first fav and next would be Thirupathi Bhimas. I went there last night as I was craving for  dosa. We first ordered sambhar idly, I have been disappointed at many places but here the vada was well soaked in sambhar, super soft and yummy. We then odered Bhimad thali it was really good too, pls try their Kara kuzhambhu with groundnuts :) I then ordered curry leaves dosa, they didn't have the paste and gave me with the podi, may be the next time :)<//review>

This place is great for both south Indian breakfast items as well as traditional meals for lunch/dinner options. We went to this place back to back twice in two days as we liked the place. We ordered idly, schezwan noodles, cut mirchi bajji and pongal vada the first time, everything was good, no disappointment at all. The service is comparatively fast, you get your items within 10min or less after ordering. The menu is reasonably priced.
The schezwann noodles are very spicy (I usually eat very spicy food and this was just a little bit too much for me but I could eat it) and the people there warn you when you order it, take their word, its very spicy. We got mini tiffin plate and schezwann fried rice the next time we went and the tiffin plate is a good combination of all the tiffin items available there and it is very filling. The schezwann fried rice was even more spicier than the noodles. Be careful when you order this item. Everything else seems to be very good.</review>

<review>This restaurant has large space. Reminds me of udipi hotel back in India.
My favorites are mini-tiffin & Bhimas thali.
They have good dosas too.
They took lot of time to get my order. I have ordered Bhimas thali.
I really found their 'podis'(powders) in the menu to be interesting. The waiter/ owner mentioned that those powders cannot be provided as sides, though I'm willing to pay. I'm fine with that.
Then another customer next to me, asked him in Tamil, for one of the powders (podi). Waiter finally gave him and me one podi (powder) along the ghee. It was good..!
Thali was good.
Thali consists of the following items.
1. Rice
2. curries(made with some beans/ vegetable)
3. sambar
4. rasam
5. curd
6. dessert.

Then in-between when I needed extra rice, I had to wait for almost 15 min to talk to a waiter.
How can you serve customers properly during busy hours, If you are unable to handle, when the restaurant is only 25% full (approx)?

The food is actually good (felt close to home food & can be improved)  but the management is ruining with their bad service.
Please Hire more waiters to handle the restaurant properly..!<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-VybWEwrpaQuqSEgRKMX6Ja12b5w5Msd1E5Bw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>A superb restaurant for good quality South Indian food. I got the meals and the variety and quality was great. Service is quite quick and good at this place. The food is not extremely spicy as some places serve and is enjoyable. Quite reasonably priced. Can get super busy on weekends. Will definitely go here more often.< /Text>< user>

We have been regulars here since 2006. Food is yummy, I especially enjoy the thali because of the wide variety of veggies in the plate. One star less because on our latest visit, instead of rotis there was punukkulu.

One can replace rotis with naan or puris or parathas but punukkulu is a starter! 😏 If that’s not an issue for you, definitely worth a visit. The food quality and the taste is amazing as always 👍</review>

<Review>Worst ever thali I have ever had. Most of them reheated and uncooked and half baked. Customer service is poor, even after complaining to change the uncooked chapatti they were negligent just served the same chapati again in different plate.
I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808fc935644c3bc5:0xa2576658ffdf090a<//gmap_id>< Date>

A nice  place to go with family joint for South Indian food lovers. One gets original taste of south Indian food. The options are also varied & one can get his favourite items. If they also introduce packaged snacks, it may be an ideal concept< /Review>

<Review>Worst ever service!

They don’t maintain cleanliness at all!!! Very late in service. There is only one person to take orders who is really arrogant and useless ( don’t even know how to talk to customers)

Coming to menu items, if you try to order anything apart from dosa And thali, they take more than 30mins with pathetic plate which is not even properly cleaned.<//Review>< Time>

Decent service and cleanliness. Average food. Baby corn appetizer was too tomato-y. Dosa's weren't anything special taste wise. Even the buttermilk wasn't as good as other places in south bay. It isn't cheap either, we paid more for the same group of people compared to Buffalo Wild Wings where we also had beer.< /text>

It is a busy place with good South Indian food. Service was fast even in peak hours. Tables and chairs were clean and the ambience was fine.
Taste of food was OK.

Food was tasteless and not warm enough. Some curreys came out without salt. Kind of sluggish food. Quality has deteriorated over last couple of years.
We ordered Mini Tiffi, Full lunch and Pav Bhaji ( for group). All had issues. Pav bhaji was also not good.</Review>

We visited this place for dinner with four Indian friends. Hotel is maintained by Indians and good amount of space available for 100 people.

Coming to food, there were wide range of Indian food available. Two of my friends ordered pongal and vada which costs 8$. Two of us ordered mini tiffin Thali which costs 10$. Mini tiffin had sweet, upma, pongal, one idli, vada, small dosa.

In other thali pongal was sufficient and really tasty.
Pros go for mini tiffin thali to taste all Indian  tiffins, if you are pongal lover, go for other one. And don't miss to order the best filter coffee here.<//text>

Ordered Thali. The food was stale. None of the items were even warm. Everything was cold. Rice was the worst. Probably made the previous day. Avoid at all possible costs. It seems impossible that anyone would give 5 stars. Like many other reviews say, none of the items are good and the positive reviews seem to be fake< /review>

The plain idly was good, but the Veda & Manchurian were not tasty.

Waiters always put the place in a random spot on the table, not in front of the person that ordered. Even if you verbally tell them who's order it is, they still didn't move the plate, which is odd.< /Text>

<review>One of the most Indian feeling restaurants I've been to in the Bay area. If you've ever frequented South Indian darshinis, you can't help but feel the similarities here. Not all dishes taste great, but some  taste really authentic. Prices aren't that bad either. Would recommend a drop in for sure.<//review>< Pictures>

I expected so much vegetarian food. But  it came disappointing. So much of confusion in ordering and menu card. They should learn how to organise things. Comparitively anjappar restaurant is far far better in quality and service.</Text>

The menu is revised and all the good stuff is gone with the new menu. Food tastes good, quantity is sufficient. However they don’t do a good job if we complain/return the order though. They try to disagree about refund or replacing the order, I don’t know why.< /review>

Great food.. good service. Feels like with a recently updated menu, they are trying to rip off customers with extra 15% gratuity for group of t or more ppl and tip over 15% which is not worth the service. The food prices too went up, but is descent for the quality and operational costs.< /Text>

Meals: some veg was burnt, some sambar tasted good, veg were not tasting great.

Curd rice: too cold and seemed like it was prepared couple of days back. Curry leaves were pale green suggesting oldness.< /review>< user>

The menu doesn't have description what the dishes are and may be confusing to non-Indian-food-savvy folks but I appreciate them taking the time to explain. From the description online I thought they have "vegetarian options" (meaning there are meat options or substitutes too) but apparently not, they're all veggies. Overall, I appreciate that the place is very clean, no heavy food smell, and service is quick, but it feels like the business is set up to cater mostly to Indian crowds (limited hours, no description on menu, and employees don't all have command of the English language).< /Review>< Name>

Decent food... But horrible customer service .... Asked for hot water 5 times but never received it till the end.... When 4 of us ordered dishes, they did not arrive together or in order or at least at regular times.... Got the dish for the 4th person after the others had finished their food and were about to leave... Will not come to this place until management changes< /review>

<text>This place has been overhyped in ads shown in theaters during Indian movie screenings. In contrast, the taste of most items like Sambar, Pongal,Dosa are nowhere close to what you would expect in a restaurant.In our recent visit at around 3PM, we ordered a thali.2 items, beans curry and More Kulambu were spoilt. They were not willing to give anything more than $1.5 discount and started arguing the discount is to enough for compensating the spoilt items.Be informed that thali was $9.99. Poor food, arrogant management and stomach pain from spoilt food is what you get. I would never go there again EVER.Can't give 0 stars hence giving 1 star out of no choice.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLlVCGcIaHUpNa1uUkbMXRi1dXkRBvmnrOxUfx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

They have some nice food options for Indo-Chinese, South Indian, and North Indian food-lovers....  I have tried their gobi munchurian, veg fried rice, hakka noodles, idli manchurian, sweet corn soup; they were all delicious and reminded me of Indo-Chinese food native to Mumbai.  As for South Indian food, which seems to be their specialty, my favorites have been their idli plate, idli vadai plate, coriander dosa, onion rawa dosa, custom uttapams (onion, tomato, peas), filter coffee (on the bitter side with good amount of chicory), and masala chai.  Their paav bhaji had never failed to impress, so when in the mood for North Indian food, that's what I always order.  Their desserts are good too: of course their rawa kesari is yummy, as are their ice creams (tutti fruity being my favorite).  Their kitchen is a bit exposed, but otherwise there is usually enough seating, prices are quite reasonable, there's always parking, and the staff is pleasant and hospitable.< /text>

We NEVER had any bad experience with this joint, food quality is excellent, service is very courteous not only from manager, but from everyone who serves customers, price is very reasonable compare to many ripoff places in Bay and San Jose area. We let waiter know what kind of taste we prefer, and our request is always honored to our satisfaction. Bhimas is GREAT in our eyes.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Horrible experience. The restaurant was close to their mid day shutdown. We walked in and we were told they can provide a quick meal or idlys. They gave us idlys with no chutney and the quick meal was not even close to being edible, let alone tasty. The attitude of just pulling in people for a few bucks and poor quality will take you no where. I recommend people stay away from this restaurant. Poor taste, poor service, poor experience. Not worth it at all!! It's a 0 star rating. Can't do that, so have to give a star.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Only veg dishes and priced well. Recently though they changed the menu and my fav thali is gone. The prices have gone up slightly which makes sense since everything costs more now. But I am just sad that the menu choices has reduced and quantity or items has been reduced too. Folks are still the same and I like going there.</review>< Pics>

We ordered a mini tiffin. The food they served was micro size. They served upma and pongal in the tiniest possible bowls. The chutney bowl was even smaller. Dosa and vada were child size. But Sambar came in a big bowl. You can see they are trying to save on quantity and serve more people. The uthapam was way too spicy. We were really excited to eat here, expecting authentic food. But it was just average taste and below average quantity.<//review>

<Review>South indian tiffin and thali available here. Good food and reasonable price. Filter coffee is perfect. But, never ever try their adai avial, you will regret. Chef either don't know the recipe or they kept it just for the sake of completeness of menu. We ordered it, gave something made of rava ( sooji) , inside was uncooked. I complained, but don't know if they change the recipe. Taking away a star.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Went on a Saturday night. Ordered mini idlis, butter masala dosa, rava masala dosa and poori channa. They kept flubbing the poori. First they brought is paratha instead of poori. Them they brought us potato masala instead of channa. The channa when they brought it was oily and tasted sorry of tangy.

All the chutneys for the other disagrees were also very ordinary.  The sambar was good though. Overall the service was poor and the food was only okay. You don't go here for the ambience anyway.<//Text>< name>

Horrible experience. The restaurant was close to their mid day shutdown. We walked in and we were told they can provide a quick meal or idlys. They gave us idlys with no chutney and the quick meal was not even close to being edible, let alone tasty. The attitude of just pulling in people for a few bucks and poor quality will take you no where. I recommend people stay away from this restaurant. Poor taste, poor service, poor experience. Not worth it at all!! It's a 0 star rating. Can't do that, so have to give a star.< /review>

Siddharth: I don't know why you are all ganging up on Bhimas? I come from Texas, and every time I am here I always go for lunch or dinner, often I have some folks with me. We NEVER had any bad experience with this joint, food quality is excellent, service is very courteous not only from manager, but from everyone who serves customers, price is very reasonable compare to many ripoff places in Bay and San Jose area. We let waiter know what kind of taste we prefer, and our request is always honored to our satisfaction. Bhimas is GREAT in our eyes.<//text>

<text>Food is just OK.  If you are Indian and if you like coffee, never ever order it here because it is not hot.  It doesn't have the taste of proper Indian filter coffee.  When I asked them to heat it up more, they took another 15-20minutes just to steam it up.  Upma was horrible.  Rice is not properly cooked in thali.  I will try to avoid this place.  Will go there if and only if I don't have any other option.</text><user>107935419831371675607</user><username>Hari A< /username>< rating>

Very Nice place for South Indian flavor, So order only South Indian dishes here.
Don't even think about ordering Indo Chinese or North Indian dishes, as those are not at even close to actual taste and texture, not good at all.<//text>

<Text>First time visiting this restaurant and this is pure veg restaurant and the food was really good. The staff is friendly. The price is reasonable at this restaurant. Definitely recommend this restaurant for veg lovers. Ordered bhimas thaali and it was really good. I liked the vatha kolambu, sambar and the cabbage poriyal. Also the pongal was really good. The downside to the dishes is the idlies were not that soft and the medhu vada was hard where as it should be soft. Overall good experience. Loved the food.< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fc935644c3bc5:0xa2576658ffdf090a</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Quality has degraded steeply in last 3-4 months. I was experiencing this second time in 3-4 months. Idli and vada were stale and very hard and sambhar was also stale. I don't think I want to give it one more chance. Very disappointed and dissatisfied.<//review>

We ordered business lunch and they gave us rice that was stale.  It smelled bad and we showed it to manager as well.  We also ordered a dinner thali in which it says you get 3 chapatis.  He only gave us 2 and when we asked, he said the grill was busy.  This was at 830 pm and he said there will be no more chapatis. Hard to believe when people were still coming and restaurant is supposed to be open till 10.

The service was horrible and the busboy came every 2 minutes to see if we had finished and if he could take our plates.  Looks like they were running short on utensils.

I would certainly not recommend this restaurant.  This was a very bad experience.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I go to this place whenever I crave for simple south Indian food. The food is not greasy at all and the sauces that go with dosa and chutney are good as of late. Dosa is a dish that has to be always cooked to order and so could never wrong when you order this dish.<//review>

<Review>Good place for decent south indian breakfast.
Had ordered food online. Shezwan noodles were extremely spicey. It happened twice. Initially thought may it was mistake. I think that's the way they make it. Worst thing is obviously we cannot send it back if ordered online.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Very good place for vegetarians. Place is neat and clean with lots of South Indian food options. Food tastes fresh and good. Price wise decent and I would say on the cheaper side compared to other Indian restaurants. Try their lunch platters they are big and makes you more than full. My fav is rawa masala dosa which is a must try but you have to wait for 20 minutes for this.< /Text>

< Review>
I wish it had a 0 star option . Its the worst place we hav ever ever been . Just by the name bhimas we chose . But it's simply a waste of time and money. We ordered thali.. rotis were like papads . Even babies can make good rotis I think . Rice is horrible . They don not use good quality of rice . The temp was 95F that day and they did not even switch on the ac. U have to see that stupid lady's face on the counter . U will not even feel like entering. I think she's is deaf and dumb coz watever u ask for she just shows with her eyes like a boss . And coming to service .. the service ppl don't even know wats in the menu. If we ask any ques he cannot answer . I know they are all students who work as a part time ..  but still one should know what their job is . There is no salt and spice in ANY of the item . And the starters are the Enders of ur life . U will hate urself for ordering it. Oh god.. plz don't go by the name . It's a high risk zone .< /Review>

This is a bad restaurant.  Look at the dosa pic that we ordered in this restaurant.  And the manager is a most skimpy, conjus and greedy person i ever saw in my life.  It's definitely a worst experience here and no doubt, they spoiled the Bhimas reputation. Please don't spoil your tastes here. There are many good indian restaurants near by. This is my last visit to this restaurant.<//review>

The food is average, and so is the interior ambiance. Some thalis are just not good. The spice levels are quite high. The only saving grace is fast service and low prices.< /review>

It used to be good. The quality has downgraded.. We found hair in the food. Items missing from the ordered dish.
When we tried to ask for the missing items the waiter was rude. He was like "what you want?"

Forgot the chappati in thali. when asked for said it is getting delayed. no courtesy of informing the customer ahead of time.

forgot the masala dosa and complimentary drink in mini tiffin. had to specifically ask for it.</Review>

I go to this place whenever I crave for simple south Indian food. The food is not greasy at all and the sauces that go with dosa and chutney are good as of late. Dosa is a dish that has to be always cooked to order and so could never wrong when you order this dish.< /text>

< Review>
After reading so many good reviews, we decided to try this place. I wish I could give this place “zero star”.We wanted to order a dosa, but the serving guy said “we cannot make dosa after 2pm”. We said ok, we ordered spicy thali for me and husband, and for my daughter we ordered mini idly. While waiting for our order. I have seen they took order for dosa and they actually served them. We asked that guy again “why didn’t u allowed us to order dosa” . He didn’t even apologize for that & said “we started again for people asking for dosa”

Pathetic service, tasteless food, thali items was super salty, which we had to eat forcefully. Didn’t even served water. We complained to the owner as well but no action.

Ended up paying only half amount of total bill. Pathetic place, will not go again.<//Review>

The problem with Indian restaurant nowadays is either they are hit or miss on the day you go. It was really nice when I went with my colleagues but didn't had good experience when I went with my family.</Text>

It has the ambience of an authentic South Indian restaurant, from the sambar aroma that hits you as soon as you get in, to the simple chairs and obviously the typical menu.< /review>

Subsidized Indian vegetarian restaurant in Milpitas on Able St close to Great Mall. It’s all South Indian  vegetarian and offers no meat options.

There is a North Indian and South Indian Thaali here. Additionally, they also offer a spicy South Indian Thaali but I wouldn’t recommend it if you aren’t used to spice levels from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Thaali rate is $9.50 and I think it is value for its price compared to other restaurants in Bay Area. They offer South Indian snack options, indo-Chinese, appetizers like Soups and beverages. They are all reasonably priced. Do try their Chili Bhaji if you like that popular South Indian snack or the spicy Schezwan fried rice which is a popular Indian flavorful imitation of East Asian fried rice.

Parking shouldn’t be a problem here anytime of the day. They are generally open for lunch after 10.30 AM and close briefly during the afternoon before opening again for dinner at 6PM.<//Review>

This place is fun, a tasty adventure! But be wary of some things - the thali curries are not great. Our okra was even burnt, chapathi didn't taste fresh. Skip the thali if you can.
Pongal was awesome. Schezwan fried rice is the indo chinese you never had before! It is the real deal. But it is extremely spicy. Order the veg fried rice instead.
And the best surprise of all - finding vadu mango pickle on the table!<//text>

A busy lunch place. The food is South Indian offering a variety of tiffin and thali choices. I usually gravitate to the business lunch thali as it sumptuous and does not make you feel sleepy. Recommend the mini tiffin sampler. Reasonable priced and quick service.</text>

A decent place for OK tasting food. The only plus is that this is a 100% vegetarian place. I ordered their Spicy Thali. Half of their items were pretty bland and tasteless. You will be disappointed if you go here with a lot expectations. Their lassi and badam milk tasted as if they were made from powdered mix.</Review>

Dosas are good. You get good variety here. I had ordered Mysore Masala dosa, though it tasted good, it was not the Mysore chutney. Pongal was also above average. South Indian Thali looks fine. I didnt have it though. I would avoid anything that's fried here. The Medhu vada was pathetic, I would give it a "-1". Not surprising, as I had few months back had some snacks like pakoras, and they too were really bad. Overall, I would stick to Dosas or Thalis. Plain Idli was average.<//Review>

<Review>Spicy thali has no taste. None of the veggs or sambhar had any taste they looked n tasted the same. Mexican are making better rotis in other restaurants.
Pav bhaji the bhaji looked like dal n pav were burnt.
Pesarattu dosa was totally dry. Even the chutneys no taste.
We had invited family friends woth their parents.
Being south indian we choose to eat at Tirupati Bhima....such a waste of money and time.<//Review>< userid>

We tried this place for the first time for dinner. The ambience is just like a regular bay area Indian restaurant, nothing outstanding as such. We ordered a starter, Mysore masala dosa and veg noodles. Mysore masala dosa served was more like a Podi masala than Mysore but taste was okay. Noodles were below average in taste. Overall I wasn't impressed with this place.</Text>

Awesome place for some homely authentic south indian food. I love the mini tiffin here. Having lived in Bangalore and Chennai,  this joint made me nostalgic. Very affordable prices. Highly recommended for those craving some idli-vadas, and even first timers.< /text>

At first I thought the filling was extra lol. Was tasty. Veg Manchurian was also good. Too much sweet sauce but as close to one India as it gets.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Had deepavali saappadu here.. food was good, a number of them I am having after a really long time: susiyam, beetroot halwa to name a few. This is my first visit here, I usually go to another south Indian restaurant in El Camino for such occasion. Comparing both, I liked the short and predictable  wait time, super fast and attentive service especially on a crowded Diwali weekend. The spread was lot more than I expect. The best part was they don't hesitate multiple servings, two vadas, two papads and free beeda and a take way ladoo per person. Satisfied</review>

<Text>Authentic Andhra Vegetarian Cuisine.

They offer the usual South Indian date of Dosai, Idli, Uttapam and Sambar but I go for their vegetarian thali. This plate of curries has tremendous variety Andis a flavor explosion. Highly recommend for those who want an authentic experience.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Had lunch here for the first time.  Food was ok, nothing to write home about.  However, why I am giving 2 stars is because the waiter was very rude asking a colleague and me to move out because there are others waiting.  When we immediately obliged, we noticed that there were only about 5 or 6 people waiting and when I looked around there atleast 1/2 dozen tables open.  It was too bad that we were interrupted in between an important conversation when there was no need to do so.  Please dont go here if you have an important conversation to hold with someone.<//review>

My review won't matter though because it is so crowded!
Refried punugulu
Meals are so average
Chutneys and sambhar not authentic

<review>Nice place to have south indian food. Quite a large space with many tables. The pakodas were not as expected. Dosa, medu wada, idly were good. Rosemilk was awesome!

No comparison with madras cafe or sarvanabhavan but this seems to be only option around milpitas.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

After a shopping stint at the Great Mall in Milpitas, our family and that of a friend of ours wanted to get an Indian dinner. My friend suggested Tirupathi Bhimas- a place I have never been to but one that my wife had visited and had a decent opinion about. I agreed to give the place a shot- if not anything, atleast to get a review in (such if the power of writing my own blog :) )

We arrived pretty late on a Saturday night. The place was reasonably crowded but not really full. The waiter having deciphered that we all shared a common language, decided to pitch in with recommendations so forceful it was almost as if he knew wanted us to eat. It was almost comical seeing him push what he thought we should be eating.

We had two tired and hungry kids. So we decided to order a simple curd rice for one of them while the other was going to share his mother’s South Indian thali. For the rest of the group, we ordered an adai avial (adai resembles a dosa but is much thicker because of the lentil batter it uses), szechuan fried rice and another plate of curd rice. The curd rice arrived quickly and we realised almost immediately that it was spicy. Yes, you are allowed to ask- how and why in the world is curd rice spicy. Beats me. The pattern was starting to show. My wife who ordered the thali complained that everything was a tad on the spicy side. She had to use the kesari in her thali to give my son his meal from hers. My szechuan fried rice was spicy beyond expectations. To be fair, I was warned that it was a spicy dish. Just that I did not anticipate the level of spice it carried. The kitchen was closing soon. I had to order a cup of the rava kesari just to quench the spice in my mouth. All in all, the spice was a tad too much for all of us to handle.<//Text>

<text>I'm not going to this place again. I ordered mini tiffin which consisted of one small idli (was surprised by the size of it, it was really mini ), one vada ( medium size ,which was good with sambar), one uncooked paper thin dosa with a tablespoon of potato masala inside it, pongal had too much hing in it so i couldn't eat , tomato chutney was basically ketchup and the  sweet ponga,I'm pretty sure had gone bad.
This place is pricier than saravan bhanavan and  it lacks both in quality and quantity of food served.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fc935644c3bc5:0xa2576658ffdf090a<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>
