I would definitely recommend Indian Sweets to anyone. I discovered this place in 2016 and since then it became my go to place place for takeouts, groceries, and spices. I don't eats sweets but am sure they are good at it too from how busy they are. They owners/management are good people, and Happy (owner/manger) treats her customers like family.<//Text>

They have a great variety of products,  also food if you call in advance . I suggest to mark all the stuff with the price and organize a little bit the store, I was in rush trying to find something that I never see until I pay and the lady gave me the item.</Review>

Super kind staff. I enjoyed it all, but the Chana Masala was SO good! And thank you for the samosas. They were heavenly! What is that sweet, red sauce?! I will be a regular customer even if that's all I get. But their store has an amazing array of items. I got some very hard to find medicinal foods and items for a very reasonable amount. The price of their food and their store products are inexpensive. It's those hole-in-the-wall shops that surprise you the most. You made a new customer!< /Text>

Worst place ever. If you have money to waste, go ahead and buy whatever you want. Food is so inedible, no where near authentic Indian food, workers are rude and untidy. I don't know how the health inspector passed this place with how trash it is. Please, never go here, I wouldn't even make my worst enemy eat this. Wanna waste money, go ahead, but if you're looking to try as actual Indian food, stay far away from this place.<//text>

<Text>Excellent East Indian food. All items tried were excellent! The store has everything I was looking for.

05-12-2021
Again we ordered dinner, stopped and picked up - Fish and Mixed Veg Pakora. I had to wait an additional 20m for my order, which was kinda a bummer.

This just meant that our items were to be fresh, right? And they were FRESH; they were piping hot when they were provided.

The items were cooked and seasoned perfectly.

Thanks again Indian Sweets.</Text>< Date>

It's a nice break from fast food, however beware if you can't handle spicy food very well. It will make your nose run a bit. The store part just has all sorts of things from frozen food to ingredients if you want to cook up some of your own Indian food.</Review>< pics>

If you are a Parata lover, this is a must visit place. This is basically a Grocery Sore with Restaurant. They also serve buffet. You must try their Paratas, with a chunk of butter on top of it. We tried, Aloo, Gobi, Muli and Methi Paratas, all were simply out of this world. Pickle and Boondi raita were also awesome. Service was reasonably quick, considering they make fresh parata after you order. If you are driving on Hwy 99 stop by at this place.</review>

It was the best place for indian sweets, till a few years ago. Good quality, freshly made sweets everytime we bought. Of late, the quality and freshness aren't maintained as well. The milk cake was overly darkened, and seems like it was made several days back. Disappointing!!< /Text>

I got my Indian food craving taken care of with their delicious butter chicken . I also went sbopping for some hard to find spices and sure enough, I located with the help of the older gentlemen who was working the registar. He also worked out a deal with me so I could afford the food with the merchandise in my budget . I went crazy with the menu and he helped me get it just right so we were both happy people by the end of the transaction . If you love Indian food then what are you waiting for. The prices are good along with the food.<//Text>

Few things are reasonable. Store is mish mash.The ppl are funny ,good to interact with.Service is not good .Some time you stand there for ever without being acknowledged. Its popular  store.Resturant side I ate two times and nvr went back.I asked for order of samosa,I got samosa chat,when I said all I wanted is samosa,the guy argued telling me I ordered samosa chatt.That was idiotic,so nvr went back to eat there again.Some of the sweets are realy nice,that's the only thing I wud go there for.< /text>

Extremely rude people.  I have been here a couple times.  Third time it was 11:15am and the store was still closed so I called 5x then finally someone answered.  I asked when do you open?  He said at 10am and hung up on me. I found a really nice Indian store on coffee rd modesto.  Eff you indian sweets.</Text>

We ordered some partha and very specially stated not to put onions in them. Walla, bring them home and what we have, tons of onions. When called them they completely denied and didn't even apologize. They should put up a sign saying we don't believe in customer service and our products are rated worst in world. Again find an another place to fulfill your Indian food cravings.< /Review>< pictures>

The nice lady gives good haircuts but doesn’t open up on time at 10:30am. It’s a business ya know. People are waiting to get a haircut here and her making the customers wait is not good for business. I would recommend she open up on time or if not she’ll lose customers that way.< /review>

To top that they make it more personal by keeping track of your cut, so you can dispense with the discussion about how you want the haircut and get down to important topics like sports, fishing, and other island life topics.

<review>The lady is super nice and I’ve never had a problem with my haircut. If for the price compared to what others charge around here and “so called simple haircuts” because god forbid a man needs more than that ?! Then I gladly will sit in this chair repeatedly.</review></record>

<Review>Worst service I ever had. $10 haircut is decent but not when you cant do a simple high and tight. I took a friend of mine too and he asked for a 5mm and she cuts it at a 3mm. Come on now. She knows how to only cut these common trends haircuts that are horrible.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Cecilia is great. She's relaxed, caring, asks questions, gives a good clean cut that's very affordable in a neighborhood packed with more pretentious options. One of those places where you can't help but start chatting with the other people in the room.</review>

Small cozy place with one chair but you cant beat the price. 10 dollars a cut. The lady barber is very friendly and she gets the job done efficiently and quickly. Definately recomend u get your next hair cut here<//text>

<text>Celia is awesome.  Everytime I go in there, no matter how long I have waited in between haircuts I get up from the chair happy.  This authentic neighborhood shop used to be run by Celia's dad.  She is doing the family business proud. I don't go anywhere else.  Why would I?</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c71c5f184fb1:0x63c198cfa1cf9eff< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Exactly what a barber shop should be! One stool, friendly service, family owned, cheap, good quality quick cut.<//Text>

Literally a hole in the wall with one chair. But barber does a great job for $10 and just as good as the barber around the corner for $25.<//Review>

A good local gas station.  I like it because it's close to my house.  It's not the cheapest, but it's very convenient, staff is friendly and it's very clean.<//review>

I needed a quick oil, lube, filter and tire rotation. They were able to handle the job with ease. They are very fast and professional. The price for the work performed was very competitive! I would recommend them and will return there again with my car in the future!</Text>

Ordered the 5 roll tacos and carne asada taco food was bland no seasoning or flavor at all very little toppings. No soap in rest room very dirty. This business needs to get their situation together. Hopefully owner takes this review constructively and makes adjustments accordingly. 👎👎👎<//text>

Excellent prices because get a free burrito of your choice after 5 purchases and a free combination plate after 10 purchases so food is really about $1.50 savings per meal which overall is hard to beat. 5 street tacos for $6 is good.< /review>< Rating>

Food is ok at best. Cooks take forever to make the food. There are numerous times when you order first with a simple 1 item order, but the two people after you get their food first.<//text>

I googled "rolled tacos" and this place popped up. Close, quick, tasty. The tacos tasted exactly as I expected. I had chicken, boyfriend had beef. Both great but beef was better. It was actual beef not taco meat. Chicken was white meat and shredded. I got it to go so I can't comment on the establishment. Only gave 4 stars because the sauce they give was just ok. 4 out of 10. I guess it was supposed to be guacamole but it was more like quachish paste. Red and green salas were very fresh and flavorful. I'll be back.<//Text>

Not happy with the decision the manager made! I needed to get red cabbage but it was too big and I asked the produce guy if he can cut one in half for me. He kindly said that he will ask the manager who was standing near by if he can cut it for me. He came back and told me that the manager said we can't cut it in half because the other half will go bad and be waisted. Most other stores cut cabbages in half when you ask them. Mr. manager it's called a customer service, but you didn't want to sacrificed half of the cabbage for customer service, bad decision on your part!!!</text>

Ive been coming here for almost 3 years and i always end up getting something expired . theres no one on the floor to ask where things are . i literally had to call them while i was in the store . just look at all your items date cause they leave anything and everything on the shelves .</Review>

<Review>I don't understand why they never have any express lanes open.  I get stuck behind whole families buying groceries for the week while I have 2 things in my hand. They should really invest in a self check out system.</Review>< Rating>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>This is about the fifth time I check my receipt and the price on an item is more than the price that was posted. A couple of times I went back to get a refund but it’s a hassle to go all the way back for a dollar or less. I think they know that most people won’t. Check your recipe before you leave the store. There produce has been pretty poor lately also. Time to find a new market to shop at.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

This is one market that I can recommend on it's cleanliness, orgenization, low prices, variety of Good food products, fresh produce and genually friendly employees. You can't go wrong in making this your one stop shopping market. On site Bakery and fresh meat,  butcher cut to order too.Did I mention plenty of parking. Happy shopping. 😁<//text>

<text>The store is close by, and the staff is friendly, so that is a plus. The produce is not as good as other stores, and it can be hit or miss with availability. The same goes for the rest of the store. Although clean, I find that I have to go to another store to get what I need, even though I ask for the items time and again.
On the positive side, the lines are not too long at the check stand, and the parking is decent and well lit. The carneceria is well stocked and has a very helpful staff.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Lately this store is going downhill. Not sure what's going on as we have shopped here for several years. They're in the process of "remodeling " and the new arrangement of the shelves is not orderly. Like items are not grouped together any more. Also, many products are out of stock. We also have bought a lot of produce there, but some of their stuff is just not fresh. We hate to have to look for a new store to buy groceries because their customer service and most prices have been good. But we can't continue to spend our money here if the store continues to decline.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d313a6465d81:0x1272ad095ee9dde7< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My only complaint as there always is particular family outside asking for money and today when I was loading my groceries two of them approached me and kept asking me to feed them feed them but they looked pretty decent they had new clothing on one her hair was freshly dyed and so I think their scammers.< /Text>< Pics>

Be careful when buying from food for less. Their owners are the same as Ralph's, and as you know, they are not as cheap as they advertise. Compare their pricing with el super and superior or vallarta before making your decisions</Text>

No stars for food for less!!! Food for less is treating Thier employees badly not giving them Thier raise they deserve as well as Thier medical insurance... I hope the employees of food for less get what they deserve so they can go back to work... And so I can change my post.... Good luck food for less employees... Especially the food for less employees that work in the city of Whittier< /text>

This place is cash only and they will not give you change so make sure to take exact change. They have alot of mazes and someone explains to you before you begin a story related to your maze This was such a great experience. The maze rooms decorations are awesome. Would recommend for groups it is really fun . They give you a costume . This place is right next to other fun options. There was a group but our instructor was a girl with pink hair.<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>The room we did sky odyssey had alot of broken floor pieces and some of the puzzles didn't work properly as they should have. Our game masters also didnt have our game prepared so we ended waiting  about 20 minutes before we could start. They were also monotone in explaing the story or the rules it was like they didnt care at all. It was without a doubt the worst experience I've ever had at this maze room location even though I've been here 3 times before and had 5 star experience back then. The restroom door is also broken so you get locked in.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The toy area was very clean. Don't worry if the kids would love to play and scattered all the toys because there's always staff would always clean the mess. I felt like this is much better and more interesting than the other playroom we visited previously. I even brought my 8-month old here and he really appreciates the toys. I really like the environment so much!< /text>

It was highly enjoyable and the puzzles made sense like 99% of the time. If you are paying attention and are listening to what is being said, then you can figure out the puzzles. Our group managed to solve the Odessey puzzle in time but only just barely. Come with an open mind and leave with an experience.  😄</Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

<Text>We were a party of two and we did the magic kingdom room
The puzzles are challenging enough but not too hard, the scene design is UNREAL, we play escape rooms quite regularly but this is hands down the most beautiful we’ve seen. The storyline is very unique and interactions are extraordinary.
Definitely coming back for the other rooms!< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Fun, Entertaining and Thought Provoking to say the least. I was told over the phone since we are novices  to try the Magic Maze because the successful rate is higher aka "easier". Which Lunar Mission is the hardest at this location. That day Magic success rate was 74% and Lunar was 29%.  But I knew my friends would like the concept of outter space in spacesuits and playing with techie stuff to solve problems. All props and devices did work correctly on our day inside. I saw other postings it didnt. Btw, we did Escape/Win with 2mins left. TWO TIPS: Dont go Drunk, tho we went a lil buzz and leave Mr. or Miss Phd. know-it-all at home. It's best to work together. The more different opinions/thoughts you have, gives you the better chance to solve the clues.<//Review>

*Review for Magic Kingdom room.*

This room, in my opinion, is great for beginners or with little experience. The production is great. You really feel as if you've walked into fantasy land. Looooove the small details in everything. The room was interactive and had cool surprises.

We will definitely be back to try out the other rooms!!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7669a741a19:0x2fb8eb1cec208810<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>We're enthusiasts who have played probably over 100 rooms. The Abyss was one of our favorite games EVER! Felt a bit different from a traditional escape room, but the set design, tech, and story line made this experience one of the most immersive we've seen! We also always appreciate an escape room that welcomes 2 players.

Katie (I hope that was her name!) was our GM. She was super accommodating and even let us book a second game (Magical Kingdom) right after since it hadn't been booked yet.<//text>< Pictures>

Uuuuuuhhh - Do you want to wear a space suit ? Enter a space shuttle and save you and your friends lives within 60 minutes ? Pretend that you are a real NASA astronaut and solve lots of puzzles that make you feel like a genius? Duuhhhh!!! 👩‍🚀 🚀 This is the place to go! We have played a lot of Escape rooms, and so far this is one of our favorites. We love escape rooms that have great production value and are super immersive like Questroom and The Basement, and this is one of those rooms. Mazerooms have some great rooms - and this one is definitely worth a try. We had a blast.</review>

This is the best escape room I've tried in the Los Angeles area! We tried the "Magic Kingdom" room, it was so much fun! Thank you to the young lady named NJ who was running the room, our "Grand Wizard", she truly made the experience for us. Definitely going back to try another room, would absolutely recommend!</Text>

<Review>This was pretty awesome. I'm a fan of escape rooms and for this room we had to repair a space shuttle to escape Mars. The story was great and the puzzles required team work which really got me and the group I went with collaborating. Would go again and do some more of the rooms here.<//Review>< pics>

Magic Kingdom is an awesome room. The tech and design are flawless - room is filled with things I had never seen before. Wow moment after wow moment. And the theme is unique, not just another boring spaceship. It was perfect difficulty as well - myself and my friend are very experienced with escape rooms, we played just the 2 of us and got out with about 20 minutes to spare. Highly recommend.< /text>

I was part of a group of 6 in the space rooms. Well thought out puzzles and great design. They have Nasa jump suits if you like. Great layout & staff, and a reasonable challenge. You can work everything out in an hour but you have to be diligent.<//Text>

<review>Great escape room, but it felt very understaffed. There was only one person working who was trying to do everything from setting up rooms and helping with hints for four different groups on the weekend. So, we weren't able to start our room until almost an hour after our reservation time. However, the room (space) was very fun and interesting, even with just two of us (though we have some experience with escape rooms). We were able to escape, and the clues weren't too difficult to get.</review>< Pictures>

<text>Tried Magic Kingdom and Sky Odyssey as a group of 3. Magic Kingdom was simple, whimsical, and fun, without being too short. Very kid-friendly.

Sky Odyssey was right up my alley, but not for everyone—You're exposed to a lot pretty early on, so you have to stay focused on what you actually need, what you can do, and what you've already done at any given point. It would have helped us to have 5 or more people in our group.

Our gamemaster Will was very experienced and enthusiastic. He gave us bonus time at the end of Sky Odyssey to solve the puzzles we didn't solve (84 minutes total), and he was still willing to answer all of our questions afterwards.

Other notes:
-The lobby looks a little run down, but the rooms are well decorated.
-Don't watch the lobby TV unless you're okay with some spoilers.
-The parking lot says 1 hour parking, but a member of our group parked there all night and had no problem. He did move his car once. Parking on Vermont is only safe after 7pm for weekdays.<//text>< gmap_id>

Good bonding experience for family, friends, or even lovers, even if the maze is not solved. It will help if the participants will read ahead of time what maze rooms are.< /Review>

Very good costumer service, we came a little late and our game host, Will, was able to accommodate so we could have as much time as possible. Will was very friendly and did all he could to make our experience the most enjoyable as possible.</text>

<Review>I've played over 130 escape rooms, and this location has the best escape rooms I've ever played.  I noticed what another reviewer noticed as well, Maze Rooms are mostly franchises so this location only has Magic Kingdom, Secret Mission, The Abyss, and the Lunar one. With another room coming soon I guess. These rooms at this location (I've done all of them except secret mission), are absolutely phenomenal. You can't beat the creativity and production value in these rooms. Magic Kingdom, is... well MAGICAL! The Abyss is a stellar decent into the depths of the ocean! And the Lunar one is out of this world amazing. I tell everyone who is playing an escape room in LA to check this place out, because they really can't be beat.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

As a self exclaimed escape room connoisseur ;) I very much enjoyed their latest and greatest offering - Lunar Mission! No spoilers, but if I had to choose between all the rooms they offer at this location (we also did Magic Kingdom) - our group of three engineers and one accountant enjoyed Lunar Mission the most. I would say Lunar Mission has more logic puzzles and communication, whereas Magic Kingdom is more of a creative thinking room. Both were enjoyable - just Lunar Mission seemed to have more challenging puzzles and the layout to complete immersion (space suits!) was just phenomenal. Book it.< /review>

<review>We have been doing quite a lot of escape rooms over the past few months, so by this point I figured I had seen it all. Then Maze Escape rooms blew us away with Magic Kingdom, and I feel like I experience a new take on rooms that I highly recommend to both new players, and veterans alike. If you are experienced, don't expect a challenge, just enjoy the presentation and fact that you won't have to open a single lock, use a single key, or find any combinations. Every clue you solve is done through  the use of the "Magic" (aka technology) in the rooms. Definitely bring kids as its geared towards them more.

We also stuck around and did a second run on Secret Mission, as we were really happy with Magic Kingdom. While the theme and some puzzles were cool, overall it didn't feel quite as cohesive to us. We did bring a kid (who was there for Magic Kingdom but stuck around with us), and another person who was experience escape rooms for the first time, but the other 4 of us have done around 8 different rooms by now. This was the second time we ever came close to failing, with the last time being the first game we ever attempted. The biggest hurdle I think came from us discovering a clue earlier than we were supposed to, which caused us to trigger a really cool event at the same time as we were trying to solve that puzzle, leading us to think it was already resolved when in fact it wasn't. After the game, when it was explained to us, it all made sense logically, but in the moment it tripped us up and caused us to lose quite a bit of time. This was also one of the first games where a puzzle was solved by doing seemingly unrelated (but clearly related in hindsight) puzzles that had gated us from progressing in the puzzles. I don't think this is entirely the fault of the game, because as a whole the experience was totally positive, but we went from solving rooms with 10-20 minutes left to getting out with 2 minutes left!

That being said, we are super excited to come back and try Lunar Mission in the future, the staff was engaged and helpful and the fact you get to wear costume pieces to enhance the experience was very cool.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Uuuuuuhhh - Do you want to wear a space suit ? Enter a space shuttle and save you and your friends lives within 60 minutes ? Pretend that you are a real NASA astronaut and solve lots of puzzles that make you feel like a genius? Duuhhhh!!! 👩‍🚀 🚀 This is the place to go! We have played a lot of Escape rooms, and so far this is one of our favorites. We love escape rooms that have great production value and are super immersive like Questroom and The Basement, and this is one of those rooms. Mazerooms have some great rooms - and this one is definitely worth a try. We had a blast.<//text>< pics>

We loved their Magic Kingdom escape room and we look forward to playing their other two at this location. It's located inside a mall, with plenty of parking. The Game Master was very friendly and welcoming. There are good restaurants a short drive away. The owner is a gentle man of Russian heritage. His rooms have unique tech and a fun, charming clueing system.<//review>

Went with s group of four and did the night castle escape room. It was a intermediate escape room so it was fairly easy to do for four adults. It was a good experience. A bit pricey for $35 a person, there are definitely lower cost escape rooms nearby. One thing that didn't make sense about the stormy night room is that it involves a laser, I didn't know nights used lasers? Would say it's a good place to check out, may go again.<//Text>

A lot of fun!
We did the Magic Kingdom puzzle, which was challenging but not too tough, a nice one for my first time.
The props and effects were cool. We were even given easy costume pieces to throw on over our clothes to enhance the atmosphere.
I would definitely go back!</review>

Fun, Entertaining and Thought Provoking to say the least. I was told over the phone since we are novices  to try the Magic Maze because the successful rate is higher aka "easier". Which Lunar Mission is the hardest at this location. That day Magic success rate was 74% and Lunar was 29%.  But I knew my friends would like the concept of outter space in spacesuits and playing with techie stuff to solve problems. All props and devices did work correctly on our day inside. I saw other postings it didnt. Btw, we did Escape/Win with 2mins left. TWO TIPS: Dont go Drunk, tho we went a lil buzz and leave Mr. or Miss Phd. know-it-all at home. It's best to work together. The more different opinions/thoughts you have, gives you the better chance to solve the clues.</review>

Such a fun time! really a unique experience, you have to try it totally worth it. excellent for groups I would recommend 4 people max In a group. Friendly staff and nice facilities. plenty of parking.  Challenging enough to make it fun but logical enough that it made sense.  Come out and give it a shot!!</Review>

The room was really well laid out and really immersed you in what you were doing. It took us a little while to getting going but when we did it was awesome! A great team-building exercise and the excitement you get from unlocking something new was cool! The guy who ran it was friendly and informative.

<rate>5</rate><Text>LUNAR STATION is the one!

In short words:
The most impressive, innovative escape game in LA, with production value as good as Disneyland. This is a MUST TRY.

In long words:
If you think of first generation of escape game (locks and keys, paper hidden under the drawer) as parks near your home; most other escape games (some mechanic gadgets but still classic puzzles) as carnival; THE LUNER STATION is Hollywood studio!

We came here on the second day of opening. before game starts, we got our gears - astronauts' outfit, backpack and a black box to secure the tube. Then we split up into 2 teams. As we only have 2 players, one got stuck in the moon station and one came as rescue team.

There aren't any typical puzzles as in some other escape rooms that you can tell were separated from the theme. All the puzzles in Lunar Station make perfect sense, and more importantly, ALL fit the theme.

We were constantly surprised during this interactive journey by its game design, decoration, lighting and sounding effect, let alone the most awesome ending. From all the details, you can tell how much time and effort they put into this game. Thank you Maze Game, for bringing us such a great game.

We were told a new fairy theme one is under construction, and it will be even better than Lunar Station. We can't wait to come back!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<review>I've done about 6 escape rooms in the last year... and this was by far the best!  We did Lunar Mission; what an incredibly immersive experience.  They even provided costumes!  Every puzzle was tightly integrated into the story, you never felt like you were just doing busywork.  Lots of great aesthetic detail in the room design... puzzles were the right amount of challenging.  An absolute must do!< /review>< userid>

Everything started out great, but about 1/2 through the room it became apparent that nothing was working the way it was supposed to.  The attendant kept having to manually push the room through to the next phase negating doing several puzzles.  When I tried to get some clarification on the things that were not working it was clear they did not want to deal with it.  Some of the puzzles seemed quite cool but really it was a small room that would be best for 2 - 3 players at most.
The way the puzzles are setup it doesn't allow a lot of people to work together on them.  With the way they handled my complaints (first time I've ever had any) I won't be going to any more Maze Rooms.< /text>< pics>

My family came here for a birthday, the staff joseph and mosses were very nice and helpful. We were in the jail room and the clues were hard but we managed to solve almost everything with the time we had. This is a good team building/ get to know others activity; it involves mental thinking more physical. We will defiantly be coming back !! Thank you soooo much, We had a blast !!!<//Text>

Good escape room! Kind of weird location in a shopping center, but was actually nice having that little 99 cent store nearby to get some candy lol.

Secret Mission room was very cool. Like the props they give you. Made me look good. The room had some great things in it. I won't spoil any surprises for any one else.

When I was there, they hadn't opened the Lunar Station yet. The guy offered to let us test it, but the time slot he gave us was a Friday afternoon. No way I'm sitting in that traffic ... even though the Lunar Station looked pretty cool.</Text>

<text>This is a review for the FBI room only. I have done the Castle Room  here and gave it five 🌟 s.

I like the room itself but we had several issues with items in the room and our radio. Our group of six has done numerous puzzle rooms and we were clicking along doing great and when we got to the final puzzle and it didn't work. At that same moment our radio decided to die so we couldn't ask for a clue from the the game master. We had about 10 minutes left so we just sat there waiting for the GM to come and open the room. When we told him what happened he looked sort of annoyed and let us do the final puzzle so that we could get the key to escape but we didn't feel like we solved the room and that was disappointing. Now everyone who was in our group says "Boo!" when we say FBI room. Don't let that discourage you from going just be aware of the limitations of the room.</text>< Rating>

My wife and I played Lunar Mission and Secret Mission at this location. Both were outstanding. Rooms are well thought out and really fun. These are the best escape rooms in LA.<//Text>

Don't book on the exact day your going you can't cancel a booking. there horrendous policy only allows you to cancel a date within 24 hours ahead of time but not on the exact same day you book the time and they won't refund your money even if you booked it 2 hours of your schedule time

There customer service are horrible I don't recommended.</text>

Sam and his crew did a fantastic job on our tile and carpets. Very professional overall, and very fast. The company gave me a quote over the phone, and answered all my questions regarding what to expect. Will definitely use them again in the future.< /Text>

I have pets and I often need to have my carpets and sofas cleaned. I’ve always had a thing for getting my carpets cleaned in the Spring and Fall.
I’ve been using Sam Miller’s Carpet Care since I moved to the AV in 2016. I’m happy that I was able to find an affordable & thorough service  in the Antelope Valley. Happy to start my Spring Cleaning with clean carpets. Thank you Sam.< /Review>< pictures>

Spring cleaning is here and I called Sam’s to get my carpet back in shape. I can’t compliment enough the great job they did.
They were timely in arriving saw all the areas that needed work and got right to the job. I have a pet who loves to mark his territory and they were even able to get those tough stains clean. The best part is the price was just right for all the work. Thank you so much!! I will definitely refer them and use them in the future!</text>

< Review>
A huge thank you to the Sam Miller carpet team! These guys are great!! Between my 5 year old and her new puppy you can imagine the stains that are left behind by these 2. But thanks to Sam Miller my carpets look brand new and I can finally have company over without feeling embarrassed! They were easy to work with and super fast!! Thanks Sam Miller I will be calling you again!!</Review>

I've used Sam Miller for the last 3 years and have always been impressed with how good my carpet looks. This time I needed 2 couches and a love seat cleaned for Christmas. There was stains on the 2 couches I thought would never come out. Sam Miller came himself came out and cleaned the 3 pieces. When he was done the 2 couches looked brand new and were dry by the evening. All the stains came out!!
Sam Miller is with out a doubt the best cleaning service in the Antelope Valley!!</Text>

I have had Sam Miller cleaning our carpets just before the holidays the past six years. Each time Sam cleans our carpet, my wife and I are amazed . Just when we think we are needing to get new flooring, Sam makes our carpet look great. Thanks again Sam for taking such great care of our carpet.</review>

I decided I would turn it over to my insurance rather then get independent testing done to prove the real cause.\n\nWhen I left her home we had agreed to replace the master bedroom, bath, and walk in closet. I called my insurance and told them my decision. Somewhere along the line after the claim had started, she decided both rooms needed to be replaced, denies the urine stain was even there and I\'m responsible for that too.\n\nThis claim isn\'t being under paid because I\'m under insured, half the claim was denied because of pre existing conditions. One of my competitors who cleaned for this client has already stated they well back my claim up of urine in the carpet seeing as though they cleaned the carpet 5 to 6 times before I did.\n\nAs of now I\'m waiting to be served and have my day in court to disprove these false claims.\n\nI believe there\'s enough wrong with the above review to take legal discourse and get my good name cleared.\n\nHere\'s a link to explain how this happened\n\nhttp://bleachstains.com/blog/\n\nDo a google search "benzoyl peroxide bleach carpets".'}</response>< Review>
Carpets were cleaned by sam millers carpet care !! Be careful consumers,there cleaner ruined our bedroom n livingroom carpets! Bleach drops all over our bedroom at least 20 spots drips of bleach ,and also our closets living room big color  change in 2 big spots! they only offered 700$ to replace $1800.worth of 5 year old carpet !! they are under insured and your at risk  ! when it happened he asked why I chose them? like what does that mean ? its been 6 months of back n forth with insurance !!!will post pictures later!< /Review>

<Review>Debbie with Sam Miller agreed to be paid upon completion of job.  Then weeks later contacted our client and told them they would not perform the work without a payment from us.  I am not sure about the rest of the world, but I would never pay anyone before a job and work is completed.  Horrible customer service.  Would not recommend.</Review>< Pics>

<UserId.>109849083719740778157<//UserId.><user_name>Bob Meadows</user_name><Review>Just used Sam Miller's Carpet Care for the first time.  We needed our carpets cleaned for Christmas.  He arrived when he said he would and was very professional.  He did a fantastic job and I was amazed at how quickly our carpet was dry.  With companies we've tried in the past, the carpet was wet for much longer.  He is our carpet cleaning guy from now on!  In fact, I was so impressed, I'm adding him to my list of honest companies that I recommend in the Antelope Valley, CA which is posted on my website.  When someone asks me for a referral for carpet cleaning in Lancaster or Palmdale, I will recommend Sam Miller.

<review>I have been using Sam Miller's services for over 7 years now. That being said, I am very unbiased when it comes to leaving a review! I will not say Good things for a company that does not deserve it. Sam has always given me a reasonable price for my size home. Like other reviews stated, he won't Sucker you in with an initial cheap quote. Now to comment on the work, it's Impeccable, or the Best I've had in case you don't know that word!! I have been un-loyal to Sam twice in the past out of convenience & price but I learned my lesson. His work and results by far exceed the competitors that i used. PLUS he is nice and polite. He is a local & family owned business which I Respect. He also speaks Good English. THANKYOU MILLERS!!!!!!!!!</review></record></dataset><record>

{'time': 1392440848870, 'text': 'We cleaned Tina\'s Master bedroom and living room with 5th generating approved cleaning products certified by the carpet manufacturers, We also treated a large pet stain in the living room at no charge.\n\nAfter it dried and she got home 4 or 5 hours later, about 20 drip discolorations appeared in the master bedroom  walk-in closet and master bath.\n\nI told here some foot cremes with benzoyl peroxide can cause these same orange white discoloration, We also have a disclaimer her daughter signed stating were not responsible for preexisting conditions that may cause problems.\n\nHowever having been in business for over 20 years and never needing my insurance to pay for any claim. I decided I would turn it over to my insurance rather then get independent testing done to prove the real cause.\n\nWhen I left her home we had agreed to replace the master bedroom, bath, and walk in closet. I called my insurance and told them my decision. Somewhere along the line after the claim had started, she decided both rooms needed to be replaced, denies the urine stain was even there and I\'m responsible for that too.\n\nThis claim isn\'t being under paid because I\'m under insured, half the claim was denied because of pre existing conditions. One of my competitors who cleaned for this client has already stated they well back my claim up of urine in the carpet seeing as though they cleaned the carpet 5 to 6 times before I did.\n\nAs of now I\'m waiting to be served and have my day in court to disprove these false claims.\n\nI believe there\'s enough wrong with the above review to take legal discourse and get my good name cleared.\n\nHere\'s a link to explain how this happened\n\nhttp://bleachstains.com/blog/\n\nDo a google search "benzoyl peroxide bleach carpets".'}<//Response>

This place is awesome! It was my first time there and I was very impressed! Very clean. Excellent customer service. Very helpful and very knowledgeable and affordable. They also sell vaccines and de-wormer for puppies, which I needed for my new puppy. I definitely will return!</review>

As a reptile owner I have to purchase insects to feed my lizard. I chose Kelly’s pets to purchase my lizards food. That was a big mistake! Sure, the staff was nice, but they are not organized. For example, I pay money to get Roaches and I always end up getting a crickets mixed in the pile. This shows that there unorganized because they are storing them in the same storage unit or box. Also, my son has a fear of crickets. So he gets mad when he goes to feed his lizard and finds crickets in the container. I talked to Kelly’s pets employees about this and they do absolutely nothing about it. Based on the following, anyone who reads this and understands the problem at hand should stop shopping at Kelly’s until this problem gets resolved. Thank you.< /text>

The crickets can occasionally get away and a stray can find its way in with the Dubias. They should still not be in the bag or container that you take home with you. I have instructed our staff to hold up the bag and turn it over checking for crickets before the bag is given to the customer. In addition there will be a sign on the Dubia containers to remind them. If there are any further concerns please reach out to me at kevin@kelleyspets.net.\nSincerely,\nKevin Kelley'}<//resp>

<Review>Came to this place and the prices were great. They had their guinea pigs in a nice area. Although they had a hamster that was not in a proper cage as it was extremely too small. This is setting a bad example for the people that are going in to buy a hamster. The wheel was also too small in that small cage making the poor hamsters back curve. A little update to their hamster care and better education to the people who are going to get a hamster would be alot better.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I wont return here. I came in to buy a tank for a turtle and the owner was very rude and dismissive. In the middle of us conversating about where she recommended me to go, she stops and has a conversation with her employee. In this case I will not buy local and will go elsewhere.<//text>

Friendly and knowledgable staff and the store is always clean and fully stocked! The prices are fair and they donate to animal rescues which is the biggest reason my family buys all their supplies from Kelley's Pets. My doggies sure do enjoy their pig ears I buy them as treats!<//text>

Good place to get doggie food. The all natural food we started getting is actually cheaper then the wally world food the dogs were eating before. They lole it better and its better for them. Then on top of that, the 11 bag is free!<//Review>

<review>Went there today and received the worst customer service. The older lady that worked was way too aggressive about my small child wearing a mask.

< Review>
This place is overcharging their customers.
Sales tax in Panorama City are @ 9.50%
These people are charging you 10.25%
I got proof.
Be carefull.
The cashier was great!
The food is just ok.  Expensive thought.</Review>

<review>The Pupusas are great and I've been coming here for years! Unfortunately, they switched to cash only recently. I haven't used cash in over a decade and I don't plan on carrying some around just for this one place.

It's very unfortunate and I hope they change their minds about this.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Amazing place because of the great food! I’m giving it 4 stars because then need to get better on their customer service. Sometimes it takes forever to get some help or get your food. It’s a great place for a lazy Sunday brunch.</Review>

<text>I can't describe with my words how delicious the food is if only you could have seen my face! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the time they take to bring your order to the table (abit long). Overall great food, great service, clean & comfortable place.<//text>< Pics>

Waited 30 mins for 3 pupusas and when I went to go ask for them they had forgotten about my order! Plus the women working there have a really bad attitude.</Review>

<Review>Be aware 10 X $10 are baby pupusas... I ordered to go and it was funny when I open my container and found tiny pupusas.  Other places have the same special but regular size pupusas. Cheese/Calabaza are $3.50 each that's pretty high.  Dissatisfied!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

We both ordered salads. I placed my order first. It took 30 minutes for my coworker to get her salad order, which was placed several minutes after mine (I ordered a Southwest Chicken Salad). There were at least 5 people working in the kitchen. I really can't say what they were working on, but it most certainly was not my simple salad! After being asked 3 times, what I ordered, I simply decided to get my refund! No apology for poor service, no anything! All I heard as I was leaving,  was "cancel the salad!" Since when does it take more than 30 minutes to make a salad?! I will not return! Zero stars if it was possible!</review>< pics>

Delicious Charbroiled Tuna Sandwich (all bun/sandwich items can be requested as a lettuce wraps) & Tampura Green Beans! Fries, Onion Rings, and Sweet Potato Fries are also an option!!
Great customer service. Online ordering makes this establishment innovative and diligent for a quick bite to eat.

Enjoy beverage refills of Strawberry Lemonade, Peach and Ginger Nectar, and the classic carbonated sodas.</text>

Update: Still no answer from messaging them, good luck to anybody trying to contact.  Changing to one star from two.

The first time I ate here was good.  Everything was correct and the food was good.  This time around my order was wrong and I didn't realize it until later.  I have a bad habit of trusting places to not make mistakes but this wasn't even a minor mistake.  I ordered a portobello mushroom charburger with sourdough substitute and added bacon.  What I got instead was some kind of chicken sandwich, with no premium ingredients.  It very clearly costs less than what I paid for.  I can't be bothered to go back and I'm just not ever going to return.  To anybody that tries this place, make absolutely sure you got what you ordered before you leave.</review>

Burger was edible, to much sauce and therefore very drippy. Fries were completely not edible. Cold and very very soggy. Watched our fries and onion rings sit on top of counter for over ten minutes while waiting on burgers.< /text>

We ordered a garden salad and it tasted like an airline salad with wishbone dressing.  I was hugely disappointed when I ordered a cheeseburger with cheddar cheese and was told they only have 2 types of cheese...yellow American and white American.  This is a burger restaurant with no cheddar.  I got an overpriced fast food burger with cold sweet potato fries.  The dinning area is so small and the outside seating didn't have heaters.<//Text><username>Jacque M<//username>< gmap_id>

Usually love the food. Today (3/21/2021) we noticed they had added self ordering kiosks. We customized each of our meals, but when we got home we realize our food was not made the way we ordered it. Unfortunately we also didn't get the add-ons that we were charged for.
What's the point of a self kiosk and customizing your order if they're not gonna read the order?!< /review>

Good selection, just enough for variety, just few enough to be really good at all off them.  Easy pickup, very organized. Shakes and malts are really good. Not too pricy for the product. Recommended!</review>

I ordered through the app for curbside pickup for two chocolate malts we waited patiently in the car after i checked in. Not a single person came outside to the curbside. After 40 minutes I had to go inside and the employee couldnt find my order. Another employee asked for my order and then proceeded to hand me two melted malts with only an "im sorry" The didnt offer to remake fresh ones. They claim my car wasnt on there but I had inputed it nd even if there wasnt a description they should have someone come out and check. UNBELIEVABLE. CUSTOMER SERVICE HORRIBLE.< /text>

Placed an order for delivery missing my onion rings, burgers made wrong, ordered extra crispy fries and got under cooked fries. Called for a refund on the onion rings and was told I had to go the store for a refund...really. If I wanted to visit the location I wouldn’t have ordered delivery. Only my second visit to this location and will be my last. Too many other choices to deal with this nonsense. Wasn’t cheap spent close to $70 in food.< /Text>

The first time I ordered from there was good, but after some time they began to disappoint me. Im not complaining about the flavor and whatnot. Instead its about customer service. 4 times did they get my order wrong and its a very simple order and easy to prepare. Usually I order a plain char burger with strawberry lemonade and fries. After getting the order wrong several times they ended up giving me 3 coupons for one free burger each. I decided to use one, but they got it wrong again. Instead I got a Hawaiian burger. What made it worse this time was that for some reason it was very soggy, as well as the French fries and other side dishes in the bag. I asked my mom and she confirmed that it was oil. Luckily not a lot of it was on the burger. I understand if they mess it up the first or second time, but 4 times is when I have to intervene.</review>

My favorite sandwich there is charbroiled tuna sandwich all bun/ sandwich items can be requested as a lettuce wraps for healthier option. Great customer service. Online ordering makes this location innovative and diligent for a quick bite to eat.< /text>

The first time we frequented this place, the meat to bun ratio was quite disproportionate. This time it looks a lot better. Everything about this place is great: The food, drinks staff, etc. During the day time, it's quite crowded so we like to frequent during the night time when it's less busy. Great location in between two dessert places: Coldstone or Frozen yogurt.<//Text>

I love Habit.. burgers are really tasty and onion rings are very good.. my kids like it here as well... My 4 yr old son though was disappointed because his gummy hamburger treat that comes with kids meal was melted.. He gives them a 1 star in the middle of his disappointed tantrum. I give Habit 5 stars but 1 star is deducted because of my sons disappointed melted gummy burger.. lol.. great place!< /text>

This location is extremely unprofessional talking about explicit things while customers are waiting. I waited 5 to 10 minutes for someone to even take my order. It's reasons like this that businesses go downhill. There wait times are 47-57 minutes. How is that possible? There was one other customer waiting.<//review>

Actually, the string beans were crispy at this location versus my local Habit. I have to say Limonite Avenue makes them better.  Otherwise, you know what you're getting... Good burgers.  I love ordering online and having the food ready when I get there. The convenience of modern times.< /Text>

< Review>
First time to eat at The Habit today. A friend recommended it to me because he knows I love cheese burgers. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the temperature in the restaurant, warm. If the A/C was on it was set pretty high. Very stuffy stagnate air in the dinning area. Was greated by a friendly women who I assumed was a manager or shift leader because she was wearing a different colored shirt than everyone else. I ordered the sesonal item, Santa Barbara Char burger. Comes with 2 burger patties both topped with cheddar cheese and grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and avocado. I also got an order of fries, well done,  because lets be honest, fries are never as crispy as they should be because restaurants are in such a hurry to get food out. Also ordered the tempura green beans. My friend got the single char with swiss, grilled onions and lettuce. He's kind of a plain guy, I always say you can tell a lot about a person by how they order a cheese burger. Anywho my Santa Barbara burger was good the patties were seasoned properly the cheese was perfectly gooey, melty, the grilled onions were ok. Not as carmelized as they could be in my opinion. The Santa Barbara char comes on grilled bread not your traditional hamburger bun. All in all a pretty good burger. It just still has that synthetic fast food feel about it. No home made love feel like I get at In n Out or Riders Club. The fries were cooked well as I ordered them but you could tell they were frozen. Definitely not In n Out fresh cut quality. The tempura green beans were good. But for $2.99 I feel like we should have got more than what they gave us, kinda stingy if you know what I mean. Drink selection was good. I'm an iced tea guy so it was pretty cool they had three fresh brewed teas to choose from, black tea, tropical tea and a citrus green tea. Also had strawberry limeade which was pretty good. In the end I would eat here again if I was in the area and didn't want to wait the 15 minutes it would take to get to In n Out.< /Review>

The servers/ cooks where very unprofessional and disrespectful. This has been one of my favorites spots to eat, I have eaten at a lot of different locations and the service has been great. Is disappointing to have experience this disrespect event at this Eastvale ca location. I’m a paying customer who always gives the respect due to people who work at this place   No reason why they not do the same .  Never again. Is the young guy with the funny tattoos in his arm. Poor place to take family out to eat.</text>

<text>I came here to get my son his birthday charburger.
While I was there I placed an order for my other sons and a burger for myself.
I placed the order to go because I didn't want to spend too much time in a crowded place with everything that has been going on.
I don't exactly live near this location, it's a good 10 miles or so from home.
I got notification that my order was ready.
The person working stated that the burgers were in one bag, underneath the fries and the other bag contained the kid's meal for my little one.
I looked inside and saw the burgers under there so I assumed they were all there.
When I got home and opened the bag, I immediately noticed that there was a burger missing, my burger.
The one that I paid extra for.
Their promotional Jalopeno Tempura Charburger.
I am usually a calm person, but I can not stand people who do not do their job properly.
This person stated to me that the burgers were under the fries.
Obviously, he was wrong.
I felt ripped off.
I paid for something that I did not receive.
I tried to call the store but calling the number does not result in contacting anyone physically at the location, but rather a call center.
Completely POINTLESS!
I am not going to drive 20-25 minutes go get something I was supposed to have in the first place.
When someone places an order, especially when it's to go, there should be extra care taken to make sure everything is in order.
There is nothing that can be done now to fix what has happened.
You guys dropped the ball here.
This is totally unacceptable and I do not see myself returning to this location again.<//text></record>

The place has good food except the fries were cold and saggy. I gave them 2 stars based on the lack of cleanliness and their saggy fries. The tables were filthy. The floor was extremely sticky and every table had trash around it. The drink area had so much trash I was not able to put the drink down to put a lid on it.

The poor girl giving out the food was also responsible for cleaning the area. She kept apologizing to people when they would ask her if someone could go clean the table.

Management really needs to have a specific  person to be responsible for keeping the place clean.</text>

<text>Seriously, whoever was cooking there on the night of 1/2/2019... never let them go. Give them whatever they want in life. Also the people providing customer service... freaking epic!!! The burger and the steak sandwiches were magical. And I ate it the day after. I wanted to tip but I didn't bring cash.

Always a great meal! My son and I went here for lunch. He had the chicken nuggets and I had the Santa Barbara Char. This location has the best outdoor seating too. My only complaint is that the apples in my son's meal were bruised.< /Review>

< Review>
Received a gift card and was excited to try for first time.  The service was fine but the burgers were so salty that is all you could taste. Very greasy too. Fries were OK.  I will say the malts were great.  I was surprised how many people were eating food from other resteraunts there.
Customer care reached out to me after my review and I agreed to try again.  I ordered the burger with NO seasoning and it was great.  My husband got a bbq tri tip sandwich and said it was good.  Of course malts.  Glad we went back will eat there again. Changing my review.< /Review>

<Review>I came here and ordered the Santa Barbara Char, expecting to receive something even moderately edible and was sorely disappointed. This "burger" is the soggiest, and most bland piece of trash I have ever spent money on just to throw away. The meat has no seasoning, the guacamole has no spice, and all the flavor came from the disgusting mayonnaise I forgot to ask to have removed.

To make matters worse, the inside of the restaurant smelled absolutely delicious. Now I say it smells absolutely delicious inside but the air was thick with the smell of Asian cuisine, not that of a burger joint. My senses were absolutely confused, and the entire scenario was off putting.<//Review><name>Kyler Falk<//name><user>112457097146763140063<//user><Time>1565308184587<//Time>< GmapID>

First time to eat at The Habit today. A friend recommended it to me because he knows I love cheese burgers. The first thing I noticed when we walked in was the temperature in the restaurant, warm. If the A/C was on it was set pretty high. Very stuffy stagnate air in the dinning area. Was greated by a friendly women who I assumed was a manager or shift leader because she was wearing a different colored shirt than everyone else. I ordered the sesonal item, Santa Barbara Char burger. Comes with 2 burger patties both topped with cheddar cheese and grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and avocado. I also got an order of fries, well done,  because lets be honest, fries are never as crispy as they should be because restaurants are in such a hurry to get food out. Also ordered the tempura green beans. My friend got the single char with swiss, grilled onions and lettuce. He's kind of a plain guy, I always say you can tell a lot about a person by how they order a cheese burger. Anywho my Santa Barbara burger was good the patties were seasoned properly the cheese was perfectly gooey, melty, the grilled onions were ok. Not as carmelized as they could be in my opinion. The Santa Barbara char comes on grilled bread not your traditional hamburger bun. All in all a pretty good burger. It just still has that synthetic fast food feel about it. No home made love feel like I get at In n Out or Riders Club. The fries were cooked well as I ordered them but you could tell they were frozen. Definitely not In n Out fresh cut quality. The tempura green beans were good. But for $2.99 I feel like we should have got more than what they gave us, kinda stingy if you know what I mean. Drink selection was good. I'm an iced tea guy so it was pretty cool they had three fresh brewed teas to choose from, black tea, tropical tea and a citrus green tea. Also had strawberry limeade which was pretty good. In the end I would eat here again if I was in the area and didn't want to wait the 15 minutes it would take to get to In n Out.<//review>

<text>Burgers are good; much better than any fast food joint. But I'm not in love with the place. Most mom & pop burger restaurants are better. Still, good all the same. Clean establishment and nice food court location<//text>< time>

Clean restaurant, friendly staff, flavorful food. The price is great too. Can easily spend the same amount at McDonalds. Would give 5 stars but they forgot the grilled onions on my burger. I would eat there again.< /text>

Food was very good. Good service. Liked the beverage assortment. Place was very clean. Knowledgeable staff. Well, except a 'manager'  who I overhead talking to a young employee about Food Safety as he was counciling her about not cleaning up a small spill on the floor. But except for his misunderstanding the difference between Safety and Food Safety I will be back. Try it, you will enjoy it.</review>

UPDATE 1/26/19
well I must say my experience was a bit better than before my food was excellent this time but (I know there's a but )the staff  seemed Soo dull  don't know  I'm use to going to the habit all the time (my favorite place to eat). The habit see is known for  being so welcoming this location just isn't. Butt This one staff member that was definitely on point with his customer service he stood out  his name was Dave aka purple shirt Dave👍🏽.

(Old review)
They was slow but they food was the same but eh idk different location just can't ever give same quality or service 🤷🏽‍♀️:c<//Text>

<review>This is my first time and also last, went there at 5pm today,  the line was long, took 10 minutes to order then waited 15 minutes to get my food. Meat patties were dry and tasteless. I ordered the mushrooms char, the golden chicken sandwich, and also 2 of Santa Barbara style as well. Thought trying more than one thing would be great but they were all terrible. My buns were chewy and very dry like they are old, pretty nasty. I threw most of my food away including the fries, very bland. I ordered tempura green beans and they were not crunchy but at least it was not bland. I asked for no pickles, spicy sauce for the chicken on the side, and avocado on the side because of food allergies. They ignored all request and that's why I'll never go back. They also give half patty on the Santa Barbara style instead of full meat patty... that was just a rip off. What I liked about this place... seating area outside.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I had their bourbon chicken sandwich. Really good. My husband had the fish sandwich. He said he really enjoyed it. The Habit is one of our favorite places to eat.< /Review>

<user_name>Karen Burr (Karen Burr, Realtor)</user_name><Text>Love the Habit! Often has a line up but that's because the food is awesome.  My favorite is the Chicken Sandwich on Sourdough adding pineapple and teriyaki sauce...messy but soooo good! Also love their tempura style green beans.
They've just added a number of salads, which is great if you're wanting something without bread.</Text></record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Called in my order so that I could pick it up quick and head back home.  They told me my order would be ready at 7pm.  Well somehow my order got lost even though I had already paid for it over the phone.  Finally at 7:20 the person behind the counter offers to give me the food that's been sitting around for 30 minutes if I'd pay again.   Umm,  no thanks.

<Text>The Habit is a great place for food (try their tempura green beans, seriously -- life changing if you don't like green beans!) but more than this the Eastvale location's service is spectacular. I've never had a negative experience with the Habit, but the one at this location was above and beyond. Employees (not the manager, if I have their uniforms straight) walked around when they had no line and made sure everything was good for the customers, one even getting someone a refill. Really above and beyond imo!!<//Text><resp>None<//resp><Time>1514961233372<//Time>< Rating>

What was once good has now changed, it's a shame The Habbit use to have great burgers now they changed them and are now dried up meat patties... This se to be one of my favourite spots to get a burger, the meat was grilled just right use to be able to order them medium rare until Californias health morons swooped in and ruined everything now i just get a dried up medium or medium well piece of meat i can throw around like a damn frisbee! Hell Carl's Jr makes a better burger and i thought they had dried up burgers but compared to The Habbit an new management I'd rather have Carl's now!</text>

This se to be one of my favourite spots to get a burger, the meat was grilled just right use to be able to order them medium rare until Californias health morons swooped in and ruined everything now i just get a dried up medium or medium well piece of meat i can throw around like a damn frisbee! Hell Carl's Jr makes a better burger and i thought they had dried up burgers but compared to The Habbit an new management I'd rather have Carl's now!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

When you open at 10:30..but it is now...10:47 and still not open "because you are fixing something? And it will be about 5 mins" Then send an associate to buy a STARBUCKS BEVERAGE..

Food is usually really good, but was disappointed by the service today.</review>

<text>The food is great but if you order a burger with bacon and cheese only and you keep getting it with barbecue sauce and onions there something wrong the people behind the counter don't know what buttons to push just to get a bacon and cheese burger and this is happened at multiple locations and the tri-tip sandwich was garbage at least at McDonald's they get your order right food is
scrap<//text></record>

It's pretty darn good! I like to get the charburger with cheese, bacon and avocado. Along with a chocolate malt, with extra malt. Ain't cheap, but it's tasty.< /text>
